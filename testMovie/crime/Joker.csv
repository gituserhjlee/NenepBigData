Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen."
1,"This is a movie that only those who have felt alone and isolated can truly relate to it. You understand the motive and you feel sorry for the character. A lot of people will see this movie and think that it encourages violence. But truly, this movie should encourage each and every one of us to become a better person, treat everyone with respect and make each other feel like they belong in this world, instead of making them feel isolated."
2,"Truly a masterpiece, The Best Hollywood film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And truly the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife.
Remarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting.
Some people are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, but it's a necessity and message.
It's about society and reflects those underappreciated/unrecognized/bullied people, proving they can do something too.
The way it shows class difference, corruption and how rich and talented rule others around them is not exaggerated and that's what makes it different.
It's BELIEVABLE.
There could be multiple JOKERs living in our society that could shake those around them in much bitter way than the film shows making people uncomforting people.
Consider this a wake up call, a message, but first a film. A PERFECT film."
3,"Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime"
4,"Most of the time movies are anticipated like this they end up falling short, way short. Joker is the first time I was more than happy with the hype. Please ignore the complaints of ""pernicious violence"" as they are embarrassing to say the least. We haven't seen a comic movie this real before. If we ever ""deserved"" a better class of criminal - Phillips and Phoenix have delivered. This is dark, Joker IS dark and you will fall in love with the villain as you should. The bad guys are always more romantic anyway."
5,"Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director"
6,"I get why some people hate this . It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness. But come on that is not the point and it will never be. Enjoy this masterpiece because Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips overdid themselves with this movie . The acting,music and cinematography are just amazing ! Please enjoy the movie without overthinking it."
7,"I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.
It's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing."
8,"It's sad that Joaquin missed Oscar for 'The gladiator' as he was very compelling Villain. But I am quite confident he will win it for the 'Joker'. Damn what a movie !!! Keeps u on the toes all the time. Unpredictable storyline and really a deep interesting plot. Did I forget to mention acting ? Damn Do niro and Joaquin teach u what really is 5 star acting.
To enjoy this movie, get a wine in your hand, close the curtains, turn of ur cellphones and put do not disturb sign on ur door. Best Dark thriller suspense movie you will get to experience."
9,"I have just watched the Joker in Venice and I will say if Joaquin doesn't get an Oscar this year then something is wrong with this world. This perfomance is just jaw-dropping, it glues you to the screen and doesn't let go till the end. Story is very good and has some interesting connections with Batman lore(especially one you can't guess from trailers). There are some scenes that are so tense ,well-acted and imaginative that push this movie to 10. Cinematography and direction are great, Todd has proven himself as a director. Robert is also good in his ""small"" role. Will definitely see it again as soon as it out in October."
10,"There is no doubt that the movie was well thought of - from the plot to execution. I must praise Phoenix's superb acting. He managed to portray very believably the awkward social reject and also the crazy murderer that he became. I really think it's a role only few could do. It was also very interesting to watch how he deteriorated mentally and little by little gave up on trying to fit into society. Gotta hand it to the script writer - the plot was unpredictable.But...There wasn't anything too complex about Arthur's mental state. No deep psychological analysis, or a web of many deep factors that created a one of a kind psychotic maniac. Could it be that I was expecting too much? Very possible since I came with very high expectations after reading some reviews.
What doesn't have anything with expectations is that at the end he didn't remind much of the original Joker. He felt more like a simply society reject that went completely crazy and started killing people. Not that much different from many other serial killers or mass murderers. He didn't have the master mind that so much designated the Joker and made him different from a simple murderer.
Another thing is that there were long parts of the movie that felt very dull.
Also I found it hard to buy the reason behind the riots in the city and the role the Joker played in them. Even if taken into account that the poverty and anger was cooking for a long time in that society, it still feels somewhat absurd that killing three people in the subway made the joker so notorious.
In conclusion, I can identify with the character which gave me a lasting impression of the movie, and this movie could have been very great if it was a movie about how a person that's rejected by society turns slowly into a serial killer. But as a movie about the Joker I felt it was lacking. Lacking the things that made the Joker actually the Joker, and not just another crazy murderer."
11,"This movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the Joker. The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of ""bad"" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn't for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.If you aren't able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn't the best movie for you."
12,"The movie affects you in a way that makes it physically painful to experience, but in a good way."
13,"The acting, cinematography, sound design, and the script itself is phenomenal. This movie is a triumph. Joaquin Pheonix deserves an Oscar win for this tbh."
14,"Need I say more? Everything about this Movie is Masterful in every single way! Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways."
15,I will stop watching movies if Joaquin Phoenix is not awarded Oscar for his tremendous acting.
16,"I quit relying on critic reviews years ago... I noticed for this movie that the critics ratings were low but viewer ratings were high. That being said, what is the point of a critic when for this movie, they are oh so wrong.
I went and saw this tonite with my mom. I went in skeptical and w some what low expectations. I knew not to expect your typical super hero movie.
What we got was a masterpiece. I went in expecting sheer boredom and I was instead on the edge of my seat the whole time. Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. Each actor took on this character and different levels, different story points and different points in time, so any comparison would just not be feasible or fair to any of the actors as they embraced him and made him come to life in their own genius way!"
17,"I thought this film was good but I just don't get the hype personally. The acting was amazing and the film was good overall but I think 'masterpiece' and 'film of the year' are a bit overused throughout the reviews. In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point."
18,"Joaquin Phoenix IS the joker. Phoenix gave a performance that felt like a mixture of Heath Ledger's joker, Jack Nicholson's joker, and Alex in A Clockwork Orange:Overall, this movie was a trip to say the least. Cinematography was very good, and the soundtrack set the perfect mood for the film for the most part. The acting and plot are what sold it though. Phoenix made me forget that the character was one I had seen before in other movies. His performance mixed with the overall feel and plot of the movie made me leave the theater feeling like I too had just taken a descent into madness.I've never been a very big fan of superhero movies so I was a little weary going into the movie, but this had absolutely nothing to do with anything superhero related other than the characters. I loved this movie and will definitely see it again. It was just what I hoped it would be."
19,"I went into this film expecting an all-time classic based on the reviews I had read & what I ended up watching was just a decent film overall. Phoenix is outstanding...so he definitely did his part. But I feel like if you've seen the trailers you've seen the movie because the best way I can describe this film is it feels like a 2 hour version of the trailer. At 2 hours it's a relatively common runtime, but it felt a lot longer...which isn't good. I'd say this is much more of a rental than a theater movie. Kinda just....eh."
20,"Do not really understand all the tens here. Sure, a good movie, good acting, nice shooting. But the plot is not so intriguing. At times it is really long and somewhat boring. I needed to double-check the genre to see if this is a drama or what. Crime, drama, thriller it said. I would put it maybe 90% in the drama and rest in thriller.I miss more dialogue, more depth, more substance. The plot is really not more then a somewhat crazy person becoming a bit crazier. Sure there is an undertone in that it is society and the system and the mean character of people that is bringing him down and creating the evil beast which later wants to destroy everything. Absolutely, but I think it is not intriguing story and plot and dialogue enough to give this a ten.Worthy of watching, yes. But not amazing"
21,"When I heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10's, I was quite hyped and excited for this movie. When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.Before I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.Film of the year? Nope."
22,"This is just my opinion but I loved the Joker, the performances, cinematography, directing, style, all build a great story. And the acting from Phoenix was incredible, he done a great take for the iconic character, and wow does he commit, with loosing the weight for the role, to developing the laugh."
23,"The recurring themes of so many of the 10 star reviews here should tell you a lot about this movie and its audience. If you can't get through a movie review without tossing in one or more claims that ""THIS movie is so much better and smarter than YOUR superhero movie"" (or even basing your entire review around this premise), then I hate to break it to you, but kid, you're nowhere near as intelligent and grown up as you think you are. This ""my comic publisher is better than yours"" BS should have been left behind on your grade school playground, it has absolutely no relevance to the quality of this movie, and your opinion of this movie should be considered highly suspect if you're in this group.I gotta say, if this movie was also your idea of the most perfect film ever made, you really need to get out more. Look, I get it. If you live in a safe little box where all you watch are superhero movies and mainstream blockbusters then I understand how exposure to themes like this for the first time would seem new and exciting to you, and I think we can all agree that this is probably the best DC Comics related movie in the last decade or so (though that's not a high bar to meet) and of course Joaquin Phoenix is a very talented actor, but stop and take a step back and look at this thing.Joker does indeed present a theme that is of importance to our society, that of the neglect and demonizing of the mentally ill to a degree that sometimes creates monsters which everyone around them should have seen coming a mile away if they hadn't been too busy looking away to avoid feeling uncomfortable. Unfortunately, reminding us all of the fact that this situation still exists is all this movie really has to say. It dances around important subjects like ""HEY KIDS, CLASS INEQUALITY!"", but then never offers any actual insight into them, usually because it's too busy making forced Batman references or dropping cringey little edgy moments like the ""Don't smile"" sign scene which seem to have been designed solely to have something for Hot Topic to print a new t-shirt of. Between that and every single plot twist being telegraphed so very far in advance because a lot of us have seen all these exact same twists so very many times before, I just wasn't impressed.Perhaps if this had been an actual stand-alone movie of its own instead of being shackled by its completely unnecessary ties to the Batman universe it could have done something more interesting with its themes. Don't get me wrong, I don't have any problem with superhero movies, but it just feels so gratuitous here, as if someone came up with this idea, pitched it to an executive, and was told ""sounds great, but can you make it a Batman movie somehow?"", and I'm sorry, but I'm just not into a movie trying to tell me a half-hearted, yet dead-serious speech about mental illness in modern society while simultaneously constantly reminding me that it's technically a superhero movie because $$$"
24,"Joaquin Phoenix gives Heath Ledger a run for his money, true story. This is not a popcorn fluff comic book flick. DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE. Shut down all ballots for the Oscar, Joaquin is taking that one home hands down. One of the best origin stories EVER put out. The only downside to this movie, is that it is a stand alone film that will have no sequels or ties to the DC Universe. Todd Philips take on the Joker is one of pure brilliance and Joaquin Phoenix was the Joker we deserved. He didn't steal from Jack or Heath but yet you got a taste of both."
25,"I know this is an unpopular opinion, but honestly this movie is overrated and boring. 2 hours felt like 3 and a half.I don't buy the whole thing where he is invited to the show. The meta ""standup"" he made was extremely dull and boring. Then gets allowed to broadcast for that long without being interrupted, also being transported in the most shitty police-car ever after that, it's just not believeable enough to me.He also acted the same when he was on meds aswell as off, so that part didn't make sense either. The police must also be really not catching this guy faster after the homocide.It has some good parts but they can be boiled down to maybe 5 minutes.
Is this a movie I would watch again? Probably not."
26,"The music. The intense. The realism. The performance. The story. Such a perfect combination of everything. I never felt that a character like joker could be real until I saw this. Phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and shows us how power can be obtained. Philips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music, camera angles, lighting and every important factor. Overall, I did not expect the story to be this perfect. Too many shocking turns happened and it really does represent today's society. If I was in the first screening, I would have applauded for 80 min not 8."
27,"I was so hyped up to see this movie, loved the trailer, only movie I have wanted to watch in the cinema for a very long time.I watched it and was bored. the aesthetics were amazing, music was good, story and execution was meh. the performance of the joker was a good performance but people raving about this are driving me mad. either you have not seen many movies or I have seen too many.this movie was bang average and was actually boring. I was actually thinking about leaving half way through as I was bored out of my mind.I do not regret watching it but it is being so overhyped that I am so confused right now. I think it had a good premise but could have been so much more, so much more.Signs of a great movie is the repeat viewing of it or it moving you, joker did not move me whatsoever and I would not watch it again.I thought maybe people are getting paid to write good review but have actually met people who think it is the best movie ever.... OMGGGThis movie is bang average and way overhyped.phoenix performance is good but as the story and execution is so bad, I feel he never even touched the higher spectrum of performance he could have with the character.I have experienced and seen worse in my life, if this made you feel, you are (i hate this word but have to use it) a snowflake. Please get off social media and live life.there is a real world out there."
28,"In an era of cinema so saturated with superheroes and gritty remakes, Todd Phillips and Phoenix somehow take a character so deeply intrenched in pop culture and create something compelling and unique. This film is unafraid to be bleak and scary without offering much to the viewer as a means of comfort. The only way we can deal with the harsh cruelties of the world is by treating it as a joke. Upon leaving this movie, you will not hate Joker, you will hate the world that made him.Phoenix simply cannot be praised enough. He brings both sympathy and tragedy in the way he moves his eyes, the way he contorts his shoulders, the way he laughs. A lesser actor would be unable to swing his moods from as far extremes as Phoenix does nor add the layers that Phoenix intricately builds for his character. The way he twists and writhes his body is mesmerizing and brings even more tragedy to the Joker. This is Phoenix's movie.As for the technical side, this movie is far different than any other super hero films of recent years. The cinematographer and director choose a shallow focus, giving Pheonix a) the undivided attention of the viewer and b) a more personal feel to the film. There are wide shots with deep focus, but they are used sparingly because this movie is about a character, not action or explosions. The color palette of this movie is intentionally composed of dour greens, blues and tepid yellows--- all of which gives the world a sickly feel. The soundtrack is used affectively, bringing waves of optimism to intentionally clash with our protagonist's angry depression. This film will likely be compared to The Dark Knight and DCEU films, which I don't find to be fair. This film is far more akin to The Machinist and The King of Comedy in tone and visual style.I recommend this film, and I think anything short of an Oscar nomination for Phoenix would be disrespectful to the effort he gives. However, I have one gripe I would like to voice. I found the tie-ins to the Wayne family to be unnecessary. It came across as pandering to an audience that loves Easter eggs more-so than the story itself. In my opinion, I think the story would have worked even better if it had distanced itself from the Batman story. Other than that, I had little issue with the rest of the film.Joker is a movie that tells us life is full of sadness, and then gives us a character whose purpose is to spread laughter and joy. I was going to finish this review with a joke, but, you wouldn't get it."
29,"Here, we have a broken man whose mental instability and illness is the catalyst for what Arthur Fleck eventually becomes, but I mean nowhere in this movie do we witness any kind of intellectual prowess, high intelligence, or even any miniscule reference to his wit and smarts to believe he has what it takes to become the Joker from the previous films.Also, there is merit to the theory that the whole entire movie was a dream playing out in his imagination, and he was conveying that to the psychiatrist the whole movie, which connects to the end since it starts with him meeting a psychiatrist and we know he was making things up by the revelations. In addition, there is no factuality to the idea that he was Thomas Wayne's lovechild. Joker is having a delusion of grandiose throughout the story, connecting himself to powerful people and situations, which would be a semi-trait of his narcissism, as well (although narcissism is far from his predominant psychological problems). I'd prefer this theory because it would explain why Fleck lacked any kind of pragmatism and intelligence we've come to expect throughout this movie.The Joker is playing the psychotherapist the whole time, making her feel sympathy and bad for him (as well as the audience), and that's the joke on her at the end, which enables him to kill her, too. This is Joker's own fantasy origin story, which has little validity.Go ahead and downvote, but there's no way this take on the Joker is intelligent and mentally competent enough to become Ledger's Joker."
30,"Joaquin Phoenix plays the role of Joker absolutely amazingly! The music, casting, storyline was perfect and very much enjoyed it. There was even an applause at the end when I watched it at the cinema."
31,"BREAKING NEWS: Killer clowns are back! But this time they're not pranksters mimicking Pennywise to scare the sh*t out of people for viral memes; they're ""incels"" threatening to gun down everyone who chooses to take their date to this dour, depressing, demented movie.If this Joker were the one featured in Nolan's marvelously entertaining Dark Knight, I doubt any of your skinny lonely drugged-up psychos would be rushing to hail this guy as his hero and inspiration.Ledger's Joker is brilliant, manipulaitve, and consumed with an infectious, and sometimes charming, confidence. Phoenix's Joker is dumb, depressing, and insecure. Ledger makes things happen. Things happen to Phoenix. The Joker controls events in Dark Knight. Events spiral out of control in Joker.There is no fun in this movie, no great action set pieces, no hint of hope or optimism. It's a two hour slog of watching a miserable man drive himself insane until he starts murdering people. Then seemingly everyone goes insane because ""they've had enough!""Change the name of this movie to Arthur, eliminate the very few references to the Batman universe, and I doubt you'd think this was an origin story to the Joker we all know and love. Maybe this Joker is the closest to what the Joker would resemble in the real world...which is perhaps why this movie is so awful. Who wants that movie?There are plenty of good character-driven films of mentally disturbed individuals who spiral out of control. There are plenty of good dark gritty super hero movies. This is neither of them."
32,"The perfect portrait of a decline to insanity""
& Joaquin Phoenix portrays this flawlessly in a performance of a lifetime.
Choreographed impeccably by Todd Phillips & is nothing short of breathtaking.
The cinematography & backdrop ideology of such an original film for such a complex character is only complimented by the superb soundtrack & acting. A hauntingly beautiful film & A Definate 10/10.
Edit: Bring on part 2 plssssss!. We all want it!."
33,"Phoenix convinces me that he has always meant to be the joker. The movie went beyond my expectations, so many emotions went through me these couple hours. I think because its rated R, Phoenix was able to unlock jokers full psychotic potential as the character he is meant to be. This was an AMAZING story, and it calls for more. And I mean a build up, a second movie, maybe one with batman? My hopes are too high at this point, but nevertheless, brilliant goddamn movie and THE BEST joker ever played hands down."
34,"The pool does not need the money. They need the dignity and respect, coz that is what it takes to be a human. If you don't have that, money will only be a reminder of them being a ""good boy"". Like some politicians, they feel so frustrated when people from the lower class does not accept their funding champions. In this movie, through joker's life, I begin to get it."
35,"10/10 Amazing story, Brilliant taking, magnificent cinematography.
Someone had to step out of the safe game played by Superhero movies and Joker movie does just that (also The Boys). Movie is gritty, real, insanely dark and sometime quite disturbing to people who don't want accept what's shown in the movie is a terrible reality we face everyday if refused a proper care.
Normally people start to compare the movie with one of the greatest like The Dark Knight and in acting wise to that of Heath ledger's Potrayal of joker.
I wouldn't say this movie is better that that or otherwise , but it will stand tall amongst the greatest like The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Citizen Kane, The Dark Knight.
Coming to the inevitable comparison of who's the better Joker? Heath or Joaquin. The answer is Both did a phenomenal job and the Joker character itself is fortunate to have being played by two greatest actors.
Definitely a top contender for Oscars. I personally think it would take away
1.Best Actor 2.Cinematography 3.Original score and if Once Upon a time in Hollywood loses in Make-up and hairstyling category it would definitely be to The Joker."
36,"Still days after seeing it, I'm still stunned by this film. I was lucky enough to see this film at the night of August 31 at the 76th Venice International Film Festival with high anticipations, and I was blown away. Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the Joker was hands down the best of the entire year. His performance reminds me why we love to watch actors play other people, why performance is such an appreciated art form. His laugh, his movements and his slow transformation from Arthur Fleck, a wannabe stand up comedian to the crazy prince of thieves, the Joker, was a thing of beauty to watch. Anybody who's watching this film has to appreciate how Phoenix committed himself to this role, you don't see Phoenix on the screen, but the character of Joker. Joaquin Phoenix might has not topped Heath Ledgers Joker in my opinion, but damn was he close and he deserves every acting award possible.
The film offers a dark look of 1970s Gotham City; a dark, griddy atmosphere where there is no joy nor happiness in this world, and in many moments, the movie gave me instant ""Taxi Driver"" and ""King of Comedy"" vibes - two of Martin Scorsese's best films - without copying both films, but includes elements from both films like e.g. all the political tensions in the city are definitely borrowed from ""Taxi Driver"" and all the bits with the stand-up comedy from ""The King of Comedy"".
The film was a deep character study of a man with some psychological and health issues who simply wants to bring laughter to this world by performing as a clown in e.g. child's hospitals and performing as a stand-up comedian. But his mental health and this broken, sad, depressive society that doesn't know any joy, do not let him be the way he is and all the people around him see him as too weird/different and simply want to put him down; in the streets, in his workplace, at his mother's house etc. to the point where he simply finds a breaking point and loses his mind every day that goes by, which leads him to kill people and then become a symbol of terror and chaos towards the end. And at every moment something bad happens to Arthur Fleck - and yes, a whole lot of things happens in his life aka. to him throughout the film - you just feel sad for him, you mourn for him since he never seemed to have any intentions of harming people at first so that the audience exactly understands the things he does throughout the film. I'm not gonna go any further into plot details since the film's not yet out and I believe - even if it wouldn't have the name ""Joker"" in the title - that everybody should go and watch this film because we don't get such deep sophisticated character study films like this everyday - especially if such films gets mainstream attention. I enjoyed every second watching this character slowly falling apart.
Although I do think that the character of Zazie Beetz was totally useless and lead to nowhere, could have been easily cut out. That's probably my only negative with this film.
But still; it's a thought provoking masterpiece that has a lot to say - about the current situation of society -beyond being just a comic book movie. It offers a completely different take on the character of the Joker with some similarities to ""The Killing Joke"" with lots of surprising twists (one word: Wayne) that even connects it with the Batman comics and will leave you speechless. And half the greatness of this film is thanks to the great performance of Phoenix!
I'm gonna say this: the scene in the third act where the Joker appears live on TV at the Murray Franklin show - which was shown in the final trailer - blew me personally away, the tensions, the build up, Phoenix's greatness and even Robert De Niro's acting, was a heartbeat moment to me. Not spoiling it, but it's amazing. I can't wait to rewatch it when it comes out in October...Check it out as soon as it comes out! #Venice76"
37,"I thought this movie was complete and utter garbage. I don't understand why people liked this movie so much. The character doesn't even stay true to the comics and the director flat out said it didn't, and then they made it seem like it was part of Gothams fall and he was just a little boy that had a laughing problem... Hated it"
38,"I was expecting a masterpiece and oscar worthy film from all the hype.
I actually didn't enjoy watching this movie.
there was no message, it was slow and the joker turned out just to be the son of a schizophrenic and went crazy over a slight amount of bullying. I don't see how anyone could relate to this character and the laughing is lame acting way overdone.
I'm just stunned that this has a 9/10 rating right now, how the hell?"
39,Arthur Fleck lives with his invalid mother. He is suffering from mental illness possibly as a result of childhood abuse. Budget cutbacks put an end to his weekly counselling sessions and he goes off his meds. In real life anyone else would quickly become non functioning but he seemingly becomes more normal.Consequently he goes from being a bumbling idiot to a highly skilled criminal. I didn't find that realistic at all. He also starts a hardly believable relationship with his beautiful single mom neighbor.It turns out that was in his imagination but the way it was portrayed made it impossible to tell which scenes were real and which imagined. The scenes with Robert De Niro seem like fantasy but apparently are real.There were many other scenes that defied belief:A random work colleague gave him a loaded handgun for free out of concern for his safety. Same person tried to throw him under a bus at the first sign of trouble.His neighbour left her door unlocked despite the dangerous neighbourhood.He was a suspect in multiple murders yet the cops made little effort to detain him.When he kills his mom in the hospital her ECG doesn't sound an alarm and nobody suspected it was him.Etc.Towards the end of the movie they recreated a scene from the Dark Knight which reminded me that Heath Ledger was 100 times better.I cannot see how the Joker portrayed in this movie could possibly become the Joker we know.
40,"Joaquin' portrayal of a sociopathic, mentally unstable man's transformation to the iconic Joker was non other than a grippingly accurate, realistic and touching rendition. A dark and disturbing character piece led by an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix. You really do feel bad for this guy, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he inevitably becomes the clown prince of crime we all know and love, although we've never seen him like this. We see him suffer throughout the movie to the point we're almost rooting for himk to become a mass murdering psyco clown, because that at least will make feel better; then it happens and we just wish this could have all just been avoided, because es so messed up. We feel for him and care about him. By the time he's the joker, we wish we could've helped him. There's a lot of great nods to the greater Batman universe, yet the movie is a self contained character piece. That can only be the mark of a great movie. All the acting is great, the plot (while similar to Taxi Driver) is brilliant and the quality of the movie shows you don't need CGI super powers to be a great villain in a Superhero movie. Is a joke not everyone gets. This movie is ""the rise of the Joker!"" 10/10"
41,"One of the best movies in these few years and 100% Oscar worthy
Joaquin Phoenix delivers one of the best performances I've ever scene"
42,"Seriously, unbelievable. Dare I say better than Heath Ledger? If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar for best actor and 'Joker' doesn't win at the VERY least, best screenplay, it will be one of the biggest Oscar snubs of our time"
43,Don't waste 2 hours of your life this movie is the baddest i've seen in a long time. Crappy writing and no good storyline...it was boring. I went to the pay counter to ask my money back for the 2 hours of torture...they can't do people like this. And for all the people with 10/10(the reason why i went) you're a  joke.
44,"While the trailers for this movie have may seemed like there was potential for an action packed movie, this movie, clearly before it came to theaters was intended to be a progressive character study. You shouldn't go into this movie expecting intense action or the joker we know of the past. This is a movie about how Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker.I have seen so many bad reviews about how boring or slow the movie is, but I believe it was utter perfection. The first part of the movie we begin to understand Arthur as a person. All of his interactions with everyone in his life, be it good or bad. The whole point of a character study is evolution. And this is far and away one of the greatest evolutions of a character I have ever seen in a movie.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is by far the best acting I have seen in a movie possibly in the last few decades. We see a challenged person be challenged by society and it completely breaks him down over time. And Joaquin isn't acting, he is evolving all throughout the movie. If anyone thinks he doesn't put on an Oscar winning performance, they're out of their effing mind. Yes, the movie is slow to start, but it has to be. We couldn't just jump into the joker and all the chaos. We need to know where it came from to begin with.The whole compilation of the movie is amazing. The complete Oscar deserving performance of Joaquin, the choreography, the cinematography, the score. Everything is in perfect harmony. While there may have been a lot of controversy surrounding this movie, the team put together a perfect movie and I pity those who can't appreciate the tears and sweat and emotion that went into making this movie.I have always been so one sided in my movie preferences between Marvel and DC. I feel like Marvel is sooo much better overall and most movies DC puts out are trash. But Joker is far and away my favorite comic movie. Even though it takes a completely different spin on comic movies. You have to appreciate the evolution to appreciate this movie. It's not an action movie, but it's really rips and tears at all the emotions in one movie while adding a wild suspenseful kick. No other comic book movie has done that before."
45,"This movie answers this question...what will the Joker be if he was a real life character ? A great deep and moving story, a life journey of a man who's suffering from some psychological issues and how neglect, bullying and rudeness by other human being can push a man to complete madness.Although it's not accurate to any comic book adaptation or any TV series or movie before it, yet it's a fresh and unique take on the character of the clown prince of crime from a realistic approach and I believe with Joaquin Phoenix amazing performance as the Joker in which he managed to bring a real life look-alike early version of the Joker which although is not comic book accurate but I feel it's a very decent foundation for Joker 2 which should be more true to heart of the original version of our lovable villain.The movie is over all a great piece of filmmaking in all of its aspects. From the plot which was very interesting, believable and many can relate to it, through the acting which was impressively splendid to the directing which was outstanding. My main take on the movie is the lack of any positive lead character, I know we live in a tough world which full of negativity but there are some positive examples here and there and to shed some light on one or two characters in this movie would've been a nice positive thought.The Joker movie can be misunderstood by many thinking it'll inspire crime and violence but I believe on the contrary that many who go through hard life will feel sympathy for the Joker character, others will even relate to his misery and may justify his actions. I believe the movie is meant to be a wake up call for many! A lot of people daily suffer from bullying, racism, hate crimes or neglect and sometimes they go through worse, we should take a deeper look at our actions and know that - aside from money and authority - we are all equally humans, we should treat one another the same way we expect to be treated."
46,If I could write just one word and say no more I'd say perfection!
47,"Joker is a unique experience It is more than a movie. It is very relatable, there are still a lot of jokers out there who are being bullied and mistreated day in and day out this movie speaks for the weak and unheard voices of the society we live in."
48,"An outstanding performance by Joaquin Phoenix which completely embodies Joker's character. This is a film which people, decades from now, will be watching and inevitably will be rendered speechless by how exceptional it is."
49,"This movie is so strong and Mr Phoenix so impressive that I can nothing but pray to god and say thank you for the creation of those emotions I got watching this movie.It is the most brutal story about (lack of) love I have ever seen.
Brutally human, political and mind blowing especially in regards to the deep connection you get to a person in our society that is in so deep need of just human warmth.The movie is a piece of art and I have rarely felt such emotions watching violent scenes.Must see and ""must discuss""Peace."
50,"This is a stunning piece of work from JP and director Todd Phillips , totalling exceeded expectations and a truly Oscar worthy performance. A mesmerising tour de force from start to finish...excellent"
51,"Joaquín Phoenix's unconvincing laughing, and looking like a beaten dog had brutaly ennoyed me after 5 minutes.
The world is mean and bad, and you can only be bad and hit back. Chaos, anarchy, whatever .. inspires bye a clown who killed 3 bullies.
More of this stupid excess of brutality in the name of... what?
Yes. It is the same director as in the hangover 3.
I don't want to be a partir of this.
Brutal and boring."
52,"What an incredible ride this was. I was almost motionless throughout, watching in awe the performance of a lifetime - the transition from troubled man to monster, the hounding score which directly drove the goosebumps, the cinematography which made you feel like you were flying through Gotham looking for Arthur yourself and the masterful De Niro who gave his nod to Jerry Lewis. Ignore DC. Ignore Batman. This is a work of art in its own right."
53,"I don't understand the high ratings. I went to the cinema with high expectations, only to discover that the movie was slow as anything and was almost finished before the first killing happened. It was a dreadful time having to wait for something to happen.
But yes, once the movie was finished and I finally walked out, I got the cosmic joke; I was the joker, trusting the reviews and leaving disappointed in disbelief I actually paid for watching it."
54,"I don't write a lot of reviews but I felt compelled to do this if only just to put in writing the thoughts in my head..that apparently are a lot different from the thoughts in quite a few other people's heads when it comes to the perception of this movie.First, in order for you to understand mine or anybody else's critique of this movie, you absolutely need to have seen all of the following movies:
Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho
King of Comedy
Fight Club
Taxi Driver
Dark Knight Trilogy
Dog Day AfternoonSo let's do a somewhat categorized approach beginning with the obvious....Acting: JP does a great job purely as an immersive method actor. He gives it his all and for that he deserves accolades. The few areas where he falters with overacting are actually the fault of the director and the editor for keeping those scenes in, since the scenes itself were repetitive and could have been taken out. The other actors do their job competently. Wait, there were other actors? Yes, there were ! Plenty of poorly written, poorly characterised shell characters that gave the artists no real scope to perform given that their combined screen time was 10%! DeNiro was wasted completely.Casting: Just because JP did a stellar job does not means he was ideal for the role. Sure, if we take the 'Joker' aspect of it away, then he fits perfectly as a traumatized, declining man. But this is a JOKER origin story, and for THAT, Joaquin is too old! The timelines just don't make sense. The young Bruce Wayne as shown will become Batman after a good 20 years (remember Bruce was a successful older business tycoon before he became Batman) So by that time, this upper-middle aged Joker will be in his 70s? Come on now.
Zazie yas potential but was not given much to do. She did a good job. A legend like DeNiro should have never accepted such a poorly etched caricature role of Murray Franklin.Character development: Whoa. All the sheep are talking about this and how 'masterful' it was. Look at the movies I have listed above and you will see how much has been copied from them in bits and pieces and jumbled together. Do people forget that at the very start of the movie he was mentally unstable and on seven medications? So his decline from that into a psychotic killer isnt that steep.
The inaccuracies are plenty as well.
Yes, a person can decline in morality, social adaptibility, schizophrenia etc.... however, a person CANNOT suddenly become MORE intelligent. So how does this person who is depicted as a bumbling fool continuously evolve into a sophisticated well-planned killer and eventually become into the character known as the Joker who was a masterful villain?The laugh: The real Joker is supposed to laugh because he is a cruel and vicious monster and he laughs at his own jokes which are actually quite witty and also laughs at death and the misery he is causing, INTENTIONALLY!! The Joker in this movie laughs because he has a mental disorder and laughs involuntarily?? What the hell.? That deviation alone should make the movie ineligible to be called Joker ..from DC comics. It's simply NOT true to the character.Story and script flaws : Some already mentioned above. No matter what the lack of funding, patients with mental disorders never ever have their medications taken away, no matter which department shuts down. This has been the case for decades. Even less wealthy countries dont do that.
How does a guy give him a loaded gun for free to protect himself and then screw him over just like that?Music: Some the older songs were cleverly placed. The score was excellent in its quality however the placement of the music was highly manipulative in order to create a faux dark snd suspeseful aura. If I show you a video of starving children and play melancholy piano violin pieces in the background, you will cry too! Emotional manipulation through clever musical score placement is an old, old trick but the shameless overuse of it in this movie was akin to 70's shock horror flicks.Direction: All over the place. Todd Philips is trying to be Hitchcock, Scorcese, and Nolan combined and he is not even remotely close to any of them. He steals heavily from their styles but whenever someone does that it almost always creates botched pacing and repetitiveness of scenes, and oh yeah, there is plenty of that.Story: There is no real plot or story. The key turning points are weak. Even IF for the sake of argument the government takes the medications away from a person with a mental disorder, uh...hello, that person will get worse and out of control, but in this movie he gets smarter and more cunning and calculated? Not possible! The link to Thomas Wayne as his dad was a cheap shot. And how convenient of him to find such a properly thought out letter from his mom who is supposed to be crazy but wrote this very sensible letter that is of such importance, and then forgot to mail it! Haha I was rolling my eyes so hard my eyeballs hurt.The so-called 'social commentary' : Contrived and oh-so #fake anti-capitalist message. Oh, those rich people behind their iron gates are oh so bad. Boo hoo.. let's protest and riot and life will be so much better! What a sad attempt at cashing in on anti-Trump sentiment. And Oh, the irony. Rich people are bad but thank you Sheep, we are gonna cash out big on this movie... You want to see a real social commentary far far ahead of it's time? Watch The Truman Show.
The sad pathetic irony of the causes of this 'unrest' is sickening. Oh look at this guy. Living in an American city, has an apartment, has free medical care, has A JOB..how many people in the world would die just to have that! But oh look at him, he gets bullied, beat up a bit, (rightfully) fired from a job..(but could have easily worked for a fast food or cafe till his comedian act worked)....but oh no no no, THIS is the limit! Down with the rich, let's kill em all. Let people pay their hard earned money to watch this, while we laugh all the way to the bank and the truly poor people in the world be like 'wtf just happened?'.Marketing and hype: Wow. I mean really wow. This is a modern day epic example of socially manipulated and engineered mass-hype opinion manipulation. Word of mouth is sometimes beneficial, sometimes not. Remember, gossip and rumors also are a form of Word of mouth. When five of your friends say that a film is a masterpiece, most are going to say that they thought so too, for fear of being ridiculed as someone who is not savvy enough to understand such 'deep' movies.The other thing is that the comic theme will draw a relatively younger audience as well, many of whom have not seen the above listed movies to catch what I call plagiarism (but if he wants to call it a tribute, even then it's a botched one.) And these folks will flood social media with hyperbole terminology. Epic. Genius. Masterpiece. Legendary. Achivement...yawn, did I miss any?
And so on and on the hype train will go till we are past the Oscars and award season of fake oohs and aaahs and speeches about this pseudo-deep movie. JP should get the award mainly for effort and because he has poor competition this year, but that's about it as far as deserving-ness.Many have already questioned how this movie had literally thousands of rated 10 reviews on this site even before its premiere? Hmm....I say hmm..But whatever. If that's the way the modern game is played then fine. It is ultimately up to the people.
As Shakespeare should have said, ""To be or not to be Sheep, that is the question"""
55,"This film is about mental illness. Specifically, a mental illness called creative diarrhoea. Seriously though, there is sooo much wrong with this movie. I won't even start with how I knew that a Joker sob story had no hope of (artistic) success, nor with why I went I went to see it anyway. I'll start by pointing out other reviewers' observation that this is not even the Joker. He's not suave, he's not witty, there are no lethal gimmicks, no morbid jokes, no anarchism, and he isn't a criminal mastermind. He's just a loser that goes off on a school shooter streak.Secondly, this is not, as I said earlier, a film about mental illness. It is a mockery of it, cashing in on the increasing awareness about mental health. There is not one concept about psychosis or other mental health problems judiciously explored in the movie (an illness which causes the sufferer to laugh in inappropriate situations? Seriously?!). All you're getting here is a downtrodden loner being subjected to beatings and injustices designed to spark indignation in the viewer, then going off on a murder spree.With regards to the much-praised acting, it's a mystery to me how anyone could have come to a judgement of Phoenix's theatrical achievement based off such an asinine script, because I can't. Not that you should devote an iota of attention to any of these positive reviews, because I'm fairly confident that there is some large-scale review rigging going on.The plot is one dimensional and juvenile, the dialogue as engaging as a monotone nursery rhyme and the character development shallow. There were goofs left right and centre, like revolvers with zero recoil and 8 bullets. Why did Arthur keep dancing? Why did we need to see Arthur fondling himself? Why is he so emaciated? Why so much smoking? I watched so many close-ups of cigarettes burn out it makes me wonder if the film was sponsored by the tobacco industry.The two positives in the movie for me were firstly, the final talk show scene, littered though it was with imperfections like the rest of the movie, which did have me sitting a little less slouched in my seat. Also, there were some interesting theories presented tying the Joker with the Batman.With the bar set so high by The Dark Knight, no director seeking artistic acclaim will go near the Joker for many years to come, maybe ever, but on the other hand, the Joker character has been rendered a boon for Hollywood opportunists, and this is the second time we've seen the character butchered in a low effort high budget money maker. This one will be forgotten quick, but I don't know how long it will be before the Joker himself recovers."
56,"Joker is literally an achievement in cinematic history there's no doubt in that ! But why people comparing it with Endgame ? Both movies have their own ways and they are completely different. Endgame was the best at its genre. Talking about Joker ... What can I say ... A beautiful presentation of storyline , direction , screenplay was all at its peak of greatness ... Heath ledger smiling down to earth :)"
57,"This was such a disappointment! It was dragging on. And I was waiting for things to explode. I don't get the hype. Everybody is calling this a 'masterpiece', but nobody can tell me why it was such a masterpiece. If it was a movie about how a society creates a killer, then it was done very poorly. To me, it felt just like a large number of scenes without a real story."
58,"I'm keeping it short, the movie sucks.Yes, I know there's a need to build character and crap, and I think it's important for any good movie.Same goes with this, I get it Joker was a troubled man, I get his frustration, but I don't need 2 hours of the movie telling me the same crap over and over again.Give the guy an Oscar for performance but throw this movie into the trash right after."
59,"The reviews here are making this film out to be far better than it actually is. Don't get me wrong, technically, it is extremely well done and Phoenix's performance is really quite extraordinary (he is definitely looking at an Oscar nomination), but despite excellent writing, acting and direction........the film is kinda boring.It had its moments, and, sure, it has some very disturbing elements but....If I had a watch, I would have looked at it many times as what this film lacks is...excitement.The final act is most excellent, but it felt like it took forever to get to it."
60,"Masterpiece, one of the best films of the decade, it has it all, acting, directing, setting, photography, soundtrack, in a few years this film will be a cult one."
61,"I don't understand why some people find it boring when this feels like watching someone's documentar.All you people think is just fight scenes, that's why you'll never find any substance of any other types.Hollywood's modern superhero genre movies are seriously predictable and cliche, this movie is probably not, maybe. So, go on"
62,"This movie is a masterpiece! It absolutely epitomizes what a DC movie should be. Dark, emotional, thought provoking, not just action action action. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.Critics have definitely lost touch with the public and should be ignored on this one. Do yourself a favor and watch it!And remember to be good to one another. You dont know what someone else is going through."
63,"I have never left a review for any title, good or bad but this is such a piece of garbage that I registered an IMDB account just to vent my opinion.
I want these 2 hours of my life back"
64,Creative actor Joaquin creativity embodied the role of the Joker film deserves more than 10
65,"DC can STILL give us a compelling movie. Wasn't quite hyped about it, I mean, an origin story of a villain made by the director of Hangover movies; what could I even expect? Then, the reviews started to drop. Still wasn't sure if I would like it. And after I saw it, it was way better than I thought it would be. I won't call it a masterpiece, but it definitely is on my top 3 DC films of all times!Good : There's hardly anything bad about Joker. Joaquin Phoenix does a great job of bringing the character into life. Rather than a typical superhero/supervillain origin story, we get to see a psychological drama + horror, and thank God, we got that. I love the genre, I love films like Infinity War, Days of Future Past, Endgame and Raimi's Spider-Man. But occasionally, it's really good to take a break from such films. It's, kind of, in the category of films like Unbreakable. Basically, the movie is (no spoilers ahead) Arthur, being tormented by the society and being a mentally unstable loner, loses his mind after the constant torment and after that, all hell breaks loose. That's all the movie shows. It would be quite difficult to give a really good story for a plot like this, since there are many movies with this kind of plot (awfully crappy ones included). I completely liked this movie, means the screenplay and direction worked for me. You can feel for Arthur, whenever the movie asks you to. You want to root for Arthur, but you know that it will mean some incredibly terrible things will happen. We see him slowly transition into Joker, and when he completely turns into the Joker it is worth a round of applause. We feel good as well as terrified with the actions of the Joker whenever he snaps and crazy stuff happens. Without getting into spoilers, I would say - in short - that it has many quotable lines and each of them make sense. Whatever Joker (a psychopath) says is more realistic than what a sane person says. And obviously has some sick, terrifying and gruesome Joker moments that a proper Joker movie should have. If it's not clear by the trailers, there's no Batman here. But (again, no spoilers) it does have some Batman references to support the movie. It could've created a mess and might have felt like a shoehorned plotline, but it plays out as a proper support for the main story and the transition of Arthur into Joker.Mixed : It is a good thing that the movie has a 70s psycho horror vibe to it. But, it could've been more original. Like many others have pointed out, it's similar to Taxi Driver by Scorsese. While it wasn't a copy and paste of Taxi Driver, but some parts make it obvious that the movie was inspired by Taxi Driver. Not necessarily a bad thing, the movie has the elements as a homage-ish way, but looking at how well made it was, it could've been slightly more original. And, it may feel a bit slow for some people, though it's worth your time.My take on the controversy : It can happen that some morons might watch this film and cause violence. It can happen with any violent movie. But, even though it justified the Joker's actions, it doesn't show them to be right. Speaking of violence, it's just psychologically compelling horror. It's less violent than Deadpool, but feels more violent as it's a serious movie. So, glorification and siding with a psychopath is a complete and total nonsense.Conclusion : It's a must watch. You don't need to follow any of the DC movies to understand it. But do not expect it to be a typical superhero action film with CGI battles and a spectacle. Wrong expectations might ruin the experience. Else, I found it to be better than The Dark Knight Rises. And TDKR is one of my favorites in the genre. If a Nolan movie is replaced by another movie in my list, you may consider it to be great. One last thing, people causing violence because of Joker would be equivalent to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly inspiring three people to have a gun duel for some gold.Rating:Score : 10/10Grade : A+"
66,"I'm making sure to give this movie 1 star because it's definitely not a 8.9 - that's a lie.Joker is not an amazing movie. It's far from great. More to the boring side.It lacks plot twist and focus too much on character development. How many times someone needs to get punched in the face before they go crazy?He suffers, gets fired, has a mental illness, nobody loves him, he's sad and he cries and he laughs and he laughs again. And he kills some people, and that's it, that's the movie."
67,"Writer-director Todd Phillips's new movie ""Joker"" appeals to me on multiple levels, primarily by offering an engaging story, strongly rooted in believable reality, related to audiences mainly by opposing protagonist's prevalent dark depressive moods while using often optimistic soundtrack and sound editing, shallow nonetheless rich visuals, angles and framing, theatricality augmented through expressive costumes, props and sets, but most impressively via great principal performances and acting choices made by Joaquin Phoenix in the lead as a title character (under proper fictional name Arthur Fleck), whose sudden uncontrollable and seemingly inappropriate laughter (justified as a medical condition) easily counterpoints the (painful need for) outcry from Gotham (read: any) City masses, hurt and deprived by injustices of their quotidian existence, as well as by Robert De Niro in a quintessential supporting role of a TV-comedy show host Murray Franklin (both worthy of the end-of-the-year acting award considerations), and by setting believable pre-course for the future adventures of the most realistic DC Comics character, the Batman (not a superhero at all, with his extraordinary capabilities rather resulting from his physical fitness and skills combined with high technology employed), who appears here only as a young boy, and whose later adult activities could be understood as largely driven by what has happened to his parents in the final scene of this movie, an event directly inspired by actions of Joker, henceforth his future main nemeses."
68,"Joaquin Phoenix just playing Joaquin Phoenix. Boring, Twisted, Sick piece of crap. A one and done movie."
69,"W.O.W!!!
What can I say about how brilliant Phoenix act performance is ??
In shortcut,movie of the year 💯/💯👏"
70,The ending is what matters in a movie. And this movie has a kind of ending which would leave many speechless. It's indeed a masterpiece:)
71,"Joaquin Phoenix produces one of the most memorable performances ever captured in a feature film, earning the hardware and accolades he received for his stunning and disturbing portayal of Joker.Joaquin puts on a virtuoso spotlight performance, and elevates the movie to legendary status. Credit director Todd Philips for building tension throughout the film, capturing the nuances of Joker's tortured dark-side slide into deranged, violent insanity, keeping the film's pace and flow on-track without unnecessary fill, utilizing and applying various camera lenses, shot angles, lighting, colors/hues, aperture settings (e.g. bokeh), and scene framing, and allowing Joaquin to tap into his own dark corners and utilize his unique acting instincts in developing his character.Phoenix's acting performance leaves nothing on the table - if keeping score, Phoenix tallies a perfect 10 producing a truly legendary performance, and transforming the film from God knows what it would have been with another actor to a 9/10.A performance and film that one will not easily forget."
72,"Absolute disappointment. I believed the hype like a fool. No person that actually saw it told me it was a good movie, just the stupid reviews. It's so cringe, with nothing actually happening except Phoenix smoking and dancing around. There is no action, no substance, no humor. Everything is so cringe and overacted.
I suppose if you like those independent movies at TIFF or Cannes this is something for you. If you actually wanna be entertained and see The Joker from the DC, this is not it.
Best description is millennial joker. Society is mean to him, nobody gives him anything so he cries and complains about it to get attention. When none is given, he starts killing."
73,"I do agree that Joaquin's performance was great, very well done and not an easy part to pull off. That however, was the only good part of the film. Movie was dark as I expected, but so much SLOW dialog it was putting me to sleep. Parts of the movie were VERY predictable, though a couple (literally two) of surprises that were good but didn't out weigh a very slow moving poorly laid out story. I say skip this one and wait for it to hit the other subscription services, I'd ask for my money back but I did stay till the end."
74,"The movie was excellent and amazing, from the beginning that Joaquin's personality is seen as he evolves in the Joker until the end, Joker is the most difficult character to do and I think Joaquin did it!!"
75,"It seems like they were making a movie about psychotic killer clown and halfway during production decided to slap on a ""Joker"" title to make an ""origin"" movie about one of the most iconic villains of all time. They could literary change a couple of names and put the ""Depressed psycho killer clown"" as a title and it wouldn't make any difference. Well, at least i would give it a 5 out of 10 score. Maybe.Phoenix's Joker is stripped, sliced, diced, blended and strained to reduce him to only one of many aspects of character itself, insanity. Well that, and clown clothes. No other character traits Joker is famous, feared and loved for are there, and I just can't see them developing ever in this version of him. Even the movie itself is a slap to the one of the most important part of the lore and characterisation, Joker never truly revealed his true identity and even the three comic book versions of his genesis are probably all lies (well Jack Napier is just a shortcut for the story sake in first Keaton's Batman, movie-wise). Forget the deadly toys and gadgets, where are the genius intellect, prankster personality, wits, planning 5 steps ahead? True Joker is the driving force, this one is just a passenger in a cab (Taxi Driver pun intended). Joker would never pitty on himself, he does not laugh because he has a psychological condition and can't help it, he laughs because he is genuinely amused with all the terror and pain he inflicts, he IS truly a psychopath, not a person with some type of Tourette syndrome pushed in a world of murder and crime. And most of all Joker is supposed to be actually funny in his sick and twisted way, not only to himself (as Phoenix is) but to all of us. This is the first time i did not find anything funny in ones depiction of the Joker (well Leto's performance is a pretty good contender, but i won't judge him on the basis of 37 seconds of screen time lol, and even that was closer to Joker than this).As if you make a Batman movie where the Dark Knight is only left with his early fear of bats and mask with pointy ears, or the Iron Man where Tony is only a rich pompous jerk.And when Bruce Wayne becomes Batman Joker will be, what, 65, 70 years old?This movie doesn't work as an origin story, it doesn't work as a standalone (it's composed of only one really long act with a glimpse of a second one), nor as a part of DC in general. It is not an origin story we need, nor deserve, it simply isn't a Joker story."
76,"Joker is basically the lite edition or postmodern version of Fight Club or the Scorsese films it lifts from. It's interesting to see how easily words like masterpiece and groundbreaking are being used for this, and that is the one joke that this movie successfully pulls off. It's just a whole lot of self-seriousness and posturing and is essentially hollow. It pretends to say a lot but ends up saying very little or nothing at all, not about the character nor about the society he's part of.It is also 'Joker' only in name and has very little to do with the super-villain. I'm all for a different interpretation and even an origin story for the joker but this movie fails to recognise or capture his spirit. Even 'Proto-Joker' doesn't quite do it justice, and I can think of a dozen more suitable titles e.g. Arthur, The Untalented Mr. Fleck, Smoker, Poser etc. Infact he's more akin to a less dangerous but also mentally unstable villain like Ratcatcher or Calendar Man though just with a clown theme, and is not even close to embodying the joker's extreme form of nihilism. It's not that it has to be a comic-book accurate portrayal, that would be irrelevant if it was genuinely a good movie. But far from being a masterpiece , it doesn't quite manage even that. It fails not just as an inaccurate portrayal of the Joker's spirit or essence, but also as a film about a person going over the edge.The weakest aspect of the movie for me is the poor to average direction. The movie lacks any of the subtlety and nuance that I was hoping for and what unfolds is not as much character development as it is things happening to Arthur. A good example of the poor writing and direction is the very Trump-like and one-dimensional Thomas Wayne character. This first became obvious during a scene in which some people happened to know the entire lyrics to a clown song. In a movie that otherwise tries very hard to be realistic that felt very unnecessary and took me out of the experience and it felt very contrived and predictable after that. It takes too many obvious liberties and plot conveniences to move the story forward in an unnatural and unrefined way, and ultimately felt like they tried to disguise the poor writing and direction with a dark and gritty atmosphere instead of those elements complementing each other.The only reason to watch this movie is Phoenix's performance, which while not groundbreaking is good enough to earn an awards nomination or two. I wouldn't put it in the same league as Heath Ledger's portrayal but they were two very different roles and characters. Ledger made his joker seem effortless while one can really see the strain and work Phoenix puts in. To put it simply, Ledger made it seem natural and didn't look like he was acting while with Phoenix you really know that he is, even to the extent that it may seem like overacting at times. Perhaps owing to the more physical nature of this version of whoever this character is supposed to be, that's not necessarily a criticism.Overall an average film at best that pretends to be a lot more. I don't see this one ageing well or being remembered decades later the way Fight Club or the Scorsese movies it's ""inspired"" by, or CBM's like Dark Knight or Logan or even Tim Burton's Batman, are remembered today."
77,"Please go watch this movie! This is the first time I've ever wrote a review on this app and I've been using it to read reviews for years! That's how good this film is. Very dark, grimy and disturbing, exactly how an origin film about the joker should be. I have no doubt it will win multiple oscars. Do yourself a favor and go see it!!!"
78,"I was so looking forward to this film given all the hype about brilliant acting etc but yet again what a let down!The film had no real storyline in the past or the present and although the acting was brilliant I had real trouble understanding the plot, if at all there was one.ONE STAR IS FOR THE ACTORS"
79,"The performance of Joaquin is excellent but the story simply don't have anything to do with the Joker, it's more about a mentaly ill man struggling with his chaotic enviroment until it's overwhelmed and snaps. I would be a much better film if the title was ""Arthur"" or ""The Clown"" but the fact that it's forced to be related to the batman universe it's why i feld it didn't work."
80,Best acting and story. This is an Oscar winning movie
81,"Joaquin Phoenix is good. The directing is pretty good. The writing is absolutely awful. This movie is trying so hard to be relevant and to have a 'message' that it just throws a jumbled mess of quasi-commentary at you hoping something will stick. It is completely unclear what exactly writer/director Todd Phillips is actually trying to say, if anything. Is Joker a hero of the resistance or is he an incel? Does he go crazy because he's mentally ill or because people are mean to him? Both rich people and poor people are horrible to Joker so what exactly is the class commentary? It's also confusing how Robert De Niro when this movie is clearly ripping off Taxi Driver in many ways, also with a little Mr. Robot thrown in. There's also a subplot with a neighbor that is so incredibly stupid and pointless, which actually has no bearing on the story whatsoever. The movie is also just listless and boring throughout much of it. A movie can be slow-paced without it being boring if interesting things are happening that are driving the plot towards it's conclusion. The only thing driving the story in this movie is knowing that he's going to become joker at some points, not anything that actually happens in the movie. The movie also spends like 5 minutes making fun of a little person for no clear reason. Also for people saying that this movie does a good job saying why you should be nicer to people especially if they're lonely or have mental health issues: firstly you shouldn't need a movie like this to be nice to people, secondly you can make a movie like that where the lonely/mentally ill person doesn't become a murderer since mentally ill people are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of crime, and thirdly if you want a movie showing why you need to empathize with criminals why not movies about all the people of color who have been victims of mass incarceration and were locked up on nonviolent charges instead of a movie about a white male becoming a mass murderer. This movie is terrible."
82,"Story was just really unconvincing. Nobody really cares that much about some random dude who is as ineloquent and uninspired as the joker is. The hype portraying the movie as painful and cruel is just cringe. To see this rated better than ""One flew over cuckoos nest"" that shows way better cruelty saddens me."
83,"They say it's all in the writing. And this is a great example of that. Good acting and production values cannot save a script steeped in tiresome stereotypes and a failure to delve into a character's identity. We meet the Joker when already imbalanced and his so-called descent into madness is really a couple weeks away; far from a descent, it's a stroll. This is not a character study, despite claims to the contrary. It's a showcase of a good actor overly contorting his body and laughing manically as a mistaken expression of madness. Where is the past? Where are the influences? Where are the conflicts? What are the seminal moments that create the spiral? Perhaps if he had really had that relationship, and had it gone sour, it would justify a descent. Instead, it's a fait accompli. This is lazy writing, focused more on fancy long shots of Joaquin Phoenix dancing crazily than producing something of value to the franchise."
84,"This film tries desperately to devillify the most stylish and charismatic villain in the DC universe and excruciatingly transform him into a poster child for mental illness in the most tedious manner possible.. This version of the Joker lacks any semblance of style, luster, flair, or charisma, leaving me to wonder why anyone would bother investing the time and money required to create this turkey, much less watch it.
They've murdered the Joker for the sake of some social commentary and PC promotion. I don't deny that mental illness is a real issue or that attention should be brought to it, but folks watch movies about supervillians to see super-villainy, not a 2 hour public service announcement. I hung in there as long as I could hoping for this movie to redeem itself, but about 3 quarters of the way through I could take no more of watching it spin it's wheels.If you are a fan of the Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger versions of the Joker then you will likely find this film as painful to watch as I did."
85,"The reality, far from fiction!! That what's made the movie,,, the oscar winner actor made a new joker rivalry with heath ledger joker, better joker in some people opinion.. piece of art"
86,"Yesterday was that day, when I understand, that I have touched history. This movie will drag you in your deepest thoughts, in your darkest secrets and suffering. This masterpiece will grind you, like a meat grinder and you will watch it in silence and with open mouth. Like the whole cinema will.
I don't like comics movie, marvel is very pompous, absurd and insipid. In my opinion. It's not an art, it's just an attraction. As DC movies was too. But now DC made history, the made art and made drama.
To be more understandable. When you watch for example Avengers or League of Justice you are eating McDonald's hamburger. But when you watch Joker you are eating 1000$ stake in the most luxurious restaurant in the world."
87,"""Joker"" is nor a ""masterpiece"" nor is it ""flawless"" as this board boasts. It's mirely a decent origin, albeit heavy-handed as sin, with choppy flow, poor directing decisions at moments, and part brilliant part wildly overacting on Phoenix's part. The heavy handed nature of mental illness is not written well... It highlghts many different illnesses with none of which feeling whole or handled with much, if any, sense of understanding. Sprinkle in are a few light-hearted moments to remind you that ""hey, he's still funny at times""... But with the strained mental illness angle it's difficult to laugh at these moments without a bit on introspection of what it is and who it is you're laughing at. The real ""danger"" this movie poses is that it's another Hollywood blunder with mental health and its handling... Which does way more harm than good.There is no great existential pandering, ss some are saying... ""it's deep"", ""my feels"", ""It's not a superhero movie it's a character study"", regardless of what anyone wants to categorize it as.. I'll consider it a generous 3."
88,"Somehow the darkest and most serious movies get the highest ratings. People say that this movie is so thrilling and that Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar but at the end of the day, it wasn't entertainment. There were so many evil moments and dark scenes but what's so good about that?This movie was almost like instructions on how to be a psycho. They flipped the usual idea and boundaries of good and evil for the audience to feel sorry for the bad guy. People seem to think this is a good thing. It's bad!The point of a movie is to entertain audiences and this movie just made me feel depressed and miserable. I'll have to watch a movie where the hero is clear and the villain is clear so I can actually be entertained. The fundemental and successful formula for a film."
89,"Joker is without a doubt my new favorite DC film. It's dark and gritty but with enough psychological twists that it keeps you guessing from beginning to end. Nothing can be taken at face value and the film forces you to think from beginning to end. Don't listen to the critics, this one is worth watching multiple times in theaters."
90,I sat through this slowwwwww movie and would gladly have left half way into it. Its a boring movie until the last 5 minutes... overhyped as usual....the violence must have been cut out of the version i seen as i think i have seen more gore in a disney movie
91,"Is it just me or does anyone over 30 see they kind of ripped off ""the King of Comedy (1982)""?"
92,"To say it was satisfying would be somewhat misleading. Joaquin Phoenix makes you feel uncomfortable almost the entire time. I couldn't help thinking about Christian Bale in The Machinist and Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver. With those comparisons, clearly I have some high praise on the acting.The film itself slowly builds momentum, but when it builds...it's really builds. Those looking for traditional comic book action may feel it moves a bit slow, but it's pace allows for the transformation to not feel superficial. When you walk out of the theater you won't know exactly how to feel, but you'll surely want to know how everyone else feels about it."
93,What a legendary character and what a legendary performance by the actor. I was not able to move on from the Heath ledger performance but this movie is totally worth it. This movie deserves an oscar. It showcased the never before seen origin of The Joker himself and you will love it.
94,"Wow I honestly gotta tell you, it's one of the best movies I've seen in years. All from the cinematography, thumping and sadden soundtrack, all the way to the OMG performance by Joaquin Phoenix, it's dark, it's evolving, twisting and wow just you can feel deep down to your bones his emotions portraying the Joker.Just alone watching hearing The Jokers laugh is so twisty and evil and you could hear his sadness coming out from his mouth. You could hear the hours of practice just on the laugh alone and his method acting is perfectly on point along with his subtle gestures and dance that is done perfectly as the Joker should be. This movie has all the psychological twisting that made you believed and immersed into the movie, I was totally shocked and overwhelmed by everything even after I left the cinema. Just mind-blowned.When I was watching in just now in the cinema, more than half the cinema cheered and applauded on certain scenes. And almost the entire patron stayed until the last credit. If u looked closely even Joker costume were evolving and changing from time to time based on his journey and experienced and just looked at the final and true form just looked absolutely stunning. Just the excitement and the dialogues told by The Joker is just so heart-crushing and it just made me felt so bad for the Joker, and it's the first time where I sided with the evil character or maybe he is the hero of this movie, who knows ?Honestly, u have to watch it, it's one of the best performance u be watching in a Long time, movies like this deserves to be watched on the Big Screen, go find the best cinema in town and enjoy the wild ride of emotions and fear and anger, just satisfying!!"
95,"Disturbing. Just got out of the movie. My humor was much better before seeing it. At first feel pity for the guy suffering, but he lacks charm and then well he is just a killer. Heath Ledger was far better."
96,"While I enjoyed the film, it felt pretty short. When ""The End"" appeared on the screen I couldn't help but think - ""That's it?""Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic with his new take on the Joker, and it's mesmerizing to see his facial expressions keep changing. And his Joker laugh is unique - sinister and full of Joker's madness.However despite some minor plot twists, most of interesting bits in the film have already been shown in the trailers. Don't expect much action like in The Dark Knight trilogy. Despite the much hyped gun violence, there are less guns in this movie than in any other Batman flick.This is not a bad film, but it's not a great one either. Watch it only for Joaquin's performance."
97,"What's the most important thing that connect a character with the public? A deep, psycological interior drama. That's what brings this cinecomic upper from others similar movie. Joker is a protagonist that you'll never forget, I'll garantee you! More human and less fictional character: it could be a story of a normal man that try to survive in this mad world where there's no right or wrong and the real normality is to be mad, it's a Pirandellian concept in a way but that's the main theme. Even Gotham and the people who live in are seen in a new, dark, cynical and more actual than ever view. An origin movie that you'll never expect. I don't spend a single word talking about how perfect is every technical aspect because probably you know yet and of course, Joaquin Phoenix is a legend. Maybe the representation of Thomas Wayne could get a little bit angry the most passionate fans in a way but apart this, for me is 10/10.
I hope we'll talk about this in the future as a brother of The Dark Knight."
98,"I am not a Batman fan nor am I particularly fond of Joaquin Phoenix, but this movie was truly exceptional. It started slow but built to a viscerally satisfying crescendo. I never thought I would be rooting for the Joker, but found that I did so throughout the movie. The Joker's pain was so palpable. I am filling out my Oscar pool card right now.PS This movie is dark and violent and decidedly not a super hero movie. Leave the kids at home."
99,"I was underwhelmed - to say it friendly - but not surprised by the fact. Because Hollywood has lost its magic looong time ago. IMHO no. bo. dy gives a damn about Darth Vader's Childhood or Joker's relationship with his mother. All we want for centuries is a proper boogeyman. If you overpaid LaLaLand-Schmocks won't jump from the stupid Prequel-explains-it-all-train - please give us at least solid filmmaking. Joker is a mess. No story, no finesse, no build-up, no surprises, no ideas. But a load of layman-psychology that should make even 12y olds roll their eyes; a cacophony of more or less unrelated scenes; cheesy taxi-driver-moments without any impact; massive overacting by Phoenix and no subtle sinister Joker moments except for the two second Elevator-Scene we all know (and love) from the trailer. rating 9.0? A joke. Heath Ledger, I miss you."
100,"I'm speechless. This is one of my favorite movies , and it's the best. Joaquin Phoenix gives one of the best performances I've ever seen. Yes, I think he should absolutely win an Oscar for his portrayal as the iconic character. Heath Ledger is still my favorite Joker, but Joaquin is pretty close to the level of Ledger. Todd Phillips did a phenomenal job directing, I think this is his best work to date. Robert De Niro is not given much screen time, but he takes advantage of the time he's given, and he shines. The costume design and makeup is great as well, and I think it should be nominated for a major award. The script is incredible, I'm going to be quoting a lot of the lines for days. The violence in this movie was not even that bad, compared to other films that have had this amount of controversy. I would like to take a minute and say, that films and other media do not cause violence, this is not a ""dangerous film."" The last thirty minutes of this movie are absolutely insane, I won't be able to forget them. The death scene on the Murray Franklin Show, is absolutely crazy, and I did not see it coming. Despite the fact that Arthur Fleck (Joker) is a mass murderer, I couldn't help but feel bad for his character at times. I didn't forgive him for the things he did, but at the same time, I did sympathize with him. I really liked the progression of Arthur's character. You see him slowly growing more and more insane as the seconds go by. The runtime was perfect it never felt boring. I loved this movie, and there's so much more I want to talk about."
101,"Acting, Cinematography, Music, Screenplay, Costumes, Gotham etc everything is 10/10.Oscar worthy performanceby by Joaquin Phoenix.Amazing directing by Todd Phillips & amazing cinematography by Lawrence Sher."
102,"This film is perfect in every aspect, the cinematography, the lighting, the small details like the trash bags alongside Arthur when he walks on the street, showing how disgusting Gotham is, and making that symbolic to how society treats Arthur; those small, yet beautiful details really make this film beautiful. a great way to end 2019, with this masterpiece."
103,"It is such a good film. Joaquin phoenix is a brilliant actor, and nailed this role. (Spoiler Alert!) There is a scene in this movie where Arthur Fleck (Joker) is doing a clown act in front of kids in a hospital and the gun his friend gave him falls onto the ground. The tension in that scene is so high that you are on the edge of your seat. Its simply a must watch!"
104,I saw this movie 2 times. It's a masterpiece. Every time I saw this this movie it made me cry and I can feel the pain of the character. joaquin performance is marvelous. In the conclusion I can say it is best movie of the dc.
105,"Truly a masterpiece, The Best Hollywood film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And truly the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife. Remarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting. Some people are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, but it's a necessity and message. It's about society and reflects those underappreciated/unrecognized/bullied people, proving they can do something too. The way it shows class difference, corruption and how rich and talented rule others around them is not exaggerated and that's what makes it different. It's BELIEVABLE. There could be multiple JOKERs living in our society that could shake those around them in much bitter way than the film shows making people uncomforting people. Consider this a wake up call, a message, but first a film. A PERFECT film."
106,"The acting, cinematography, sound design and the script itself are phenomenal. The film deserved its Oscar.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least. It's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root."
107,"Is Joker the worst comic book movie I ever saw? No that would be Batman and Robin.( thanks to the worst comic book performance of all-time by Alicia Silverstone ( Batgirl)). Perhaps I am not sophisticated enough to get the movie, but I found it unpleasant ( except for the Sinatra music and the setting). I do not care for Arthur/Joker and did not have one speck of sympathy for him Why? For one his goal is not to make things better, it is about anarchy ( unlike say what we saw in V is for Vendetta). Spoilers ahead: Who people should feel for is young Bruce Wayne who sees his parents murdered in cold blood in front of him. There is nothing funny about seeing a child orphaned. As far as movies are concerned, I enjoyed Ledger and Nicholson as Joker, and I also liked him in comics and cartoons. Why? He is the perfect counterpoint to Batman, and vice versa.. Batman almost never laughs and Joker ( rarely) cries. This is a movie of hopelessness and depression, that makes you feel things cannot possibly get better. While Batman is the Dark Knight and that name alone says he not a fun loving character with wisecracks like Spider-Man, his presence in Gotham City gives hope of a better future ( something not seen in Joker). I did not like the movie. 3/10 stars."
108,"Only 1% audience who think what they do is always correct like this film and try to project their actions as ultimate to the entire world.. a harmful film for the society.
But jokers acting is top notch. Director might have utilized him better than this."
109,"I am not sure of the point of this movie.
Was there supposed to be a lesson here.Here is what I saw.
Capitalism bad. Mean businesses men on a train picking on a mentally disabled man.
Is this really a common issue today.
Have a lot of people ridden on public transportation and been bullied by Wall Street business men.
People in the movie where cheering on a man who murdered three business men.
The rioting in the streets may me think ""Clown Lives Matter"".Bruce father from what I seen in other movies was a man respected by his community, loving father, devoted husband. In this movie he is a bully who had a secret affair with a woman who happened to have her own mental issues.
It was like trying to force a justification for murdering Bruce's parents.This movie basically looked like a promo for Antifa.
Join the resistance
Take on the corporate bulliesI may have found some value in this as a movie that shows someone else's perspective of our society, but it was over hyped and my expectations where very huge.I'm tired of being lectured by Hollywood.
I'm surprised they did not change Bruce's father's name to Donald Wayne."
110,Ratings for acting are overrated. This movie is terrible. I watched a man smoke 112 cigarettes and do a fake laugh for two hour
111,"If it wasn't for the title and make-up, you wouldn't know it was based on the comic-book character. First of all, the real Joker is not a weak and unconfident pushover. Not even in his genesis stage. The real Joker had a high tolerance for pain, could fight and was intelligent. Which made him dangerous due to his insanity. When Joaquin shoots the guy on the subway, he does it out of cowardice. They try to make up for it with the Murray shooting scene. There is no way that Joaquin's Joker will ever fill the shoes of the badass Joker in the comics, not even the different incarnations by different comic authors....and just forget about even coming close to Heath Ledger's portrayal. They should have just called the movie something totally different and forget about trying to make the connection."
112,"There is doing an homage and then there is borrowing wholesale from other material. This film is little more than a remake of ""Taxi Driver"" with elements (most notably the end) borrowed from ""Network"".
In the case of ""Taxi Driver"" there are whole lines of dialogue, characters and scenes that are lifted from it and placed in this movie. Except the execution isn't as polished, the acting not of the same caliber and the story not as original.Watch ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Network"", this film was made 40 years earlier and was made better."
113,"If you plan on watching this I would suggest skipping to the last 20 or 30mins. Otherwise it's completely boring, I thought people were saying this was suppose to be better then Heath Ledgers joker? Not to say this joker doesn't have potential but they just spent 90% of the movie showing that he has a mental issue."
114,"This movie represents everything wrong with Hollywood. Take an existing thing, make vast changes to it to the point it is no longer the thing it was, yet still call it the same thing to profit off its popularity.This story is of a loser at the end of his ropes. His life was sad, pathetic and he is powerless and thus...of course, lashes out at the world for it. This is a millennial's story. A person that blames everyone else, is a victim. There is no strength in this character. He isnt scary. He isnt a thing to be feared. This so called Joker, because he is without strength, knowledge could never be what the Joker actually is. Hard to kill, vastly intelligent and a criminal master-mind.Besides undermining every single thing that is the Joker's history, it makes a mockery of the Batman universe. This ""man"", who has no criminal history, cant fight worth a damn and is a low-IQ nit-wit, can just magically become not only Batmans greatest enemy, but can hold his own against the most powerful mob bosses and villains in the DC Universe. Why? Because he hates the world because his life sucked.Most at this point will have gone on about the deep psychological aspect of the film and claim that only a few can understand it...it is true. It is a deep psychological look at the mind of a professional victim that has failed at life and wants to burn the world because of it all while ignoring how it could never happen because a person like this could only hope to go out with a bang, literally as weak beta males can only hope to do, or ever do. It takes personal and mental strength to because a thing that gains power, keeps it, and uses it. That, makes this movie a failure on all levels other than acting. Which is supurb. Phoenix himself would make a great Joker, if he was cast to play the actual Joker.Sadly, this movie has missed the mark on coming remotely close to being like the character that is the Joker. Any incarnation of it. At least Leto was close to the New 52 Joker, enough that makes that role, more Joker than this one."
115,"Wow, what a movie! I have to admit, When I first heard Joaquin Phoenix was going to be the joker, I was surprised. I wasn't sure how he was going to pull it off. I was hoping it wasn't going to be another cheesy rendition full of fluff and unrealistic explanations of how the Joker came to be. One where my (adult) son wouldn't have to keep nudging me to wake me up. I was pleasantly surprised on well Todd Phillips' version played and Joaquin's acting was superb. You could feel the anguish his character was going through right up to the point he lost his mind. Just an excellent, well acted movie that you almost forget is derived from a DC comic."
116,"A mentally ill person without talents (or intelligence) cannot become a super villain just because he is angry. He will only be a mentally ill person with no talents (and intelligence) in anger. Nothing more. As a film, Joker lacks creativity or depth. In all senses. Unfortunately Joker did for the iconical character the same thing that Twilight did for vampire films."
117,"Parisians love movies. As I walk around the city, I see hundreds of movie theatres with all kinds of movies playing. Today, I decided to look at a big, multiplex movie theatre that is right around the corner from where I am staying, UGC CINÉ CITÉ LES HALLES - would you believe it is showing 46 films on 27 separate screens?When you go to a French movie and you speak as little Frecnh as I do, you'll need to go see an American or English movie that is NOT dubbed but rather sub-titled. France has acronyms that describe what you will see -VO stands for Version Originale, or the original version of the film with French subtitles for audiences that do not understand the native language of the film.VF stands for Version Française, meaning that it is the French version of the film which has been dubbed with French audio - no subtitles.VOSTFR stands for Version Originale Sous-Titrée en FRançais, meaning that it is the original version of a film with subtitles in French.Finally, the term VOST stands for Version Originale Sous-Titrée, or the original version of a film with subtitles in the film's original language.Most American films are dubbed in France and it is strange to hear the voices since they are nothing like the actor's real voice.I saw Joker at a packed house. The audience was much more quiet than an American one. But, first, let me answer the question I know you are asking yourself - and the answer is Yes, they sell popcorn and it's good, but you'll have to first answer the BIG question when you order - sweet or sour? Sweet? Sour? I answered - sel, seulemont (salt only). The young woman was incredulous, but gave me my popcorn.The most important thing about the movie you should know is that Joker is not about the Joker you and I and the rest of the world associate with Batman. This Joker is the Joker who became that Joker. Yes, eventually, he commits crimes but they are the ordinary crimes that most non-supervillains commit.This Joker, played with wild abandon by Joaquin Phoenix, is a mommy's boy who has delusions of being normal. He lives in a city that resembles New York City in the 1970s. If you weren't there, it was a garbage-strewn, graffiti-emblazoned mess. Arthur Fleck, Joker's real name, is a clown who plays at childrens' parties. One day, he loses his job (the reason is silly) and discovers that his much-adored mother (Frances Conroy) may be as crazy and delusional as he is. Along the way, the film takes potshots at cutting the funding for mentally ill people - anyway, it's a really bad day and Arthur snaps.One of his heroes is a Tonight-like show's host, Murray Franklin, played unconvincingly by Robert DeNiro. I think that is the first time I used that word to describe a DeNiro performance, but his totally stiff appearance makes his being cast as a Johnny Carson-ish character one of the greatest miscastings in the history of the movies. I mean, DeNiro would be better cast as Robin Hood or Cary Grant. Add the miscasting to the fact that the character is totally unappealing and you have hit the movie disaster jackpot.Arthur longs to be a stand-up comic and make people laugh. His mother, may or may not have had Arthur during an affair with Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) - and there's your Batman connection.Joker is one of the most evil films I have ever seen. I know that seems a strange word to use, but this movie cynically uses the depressingly wide gap between the haves and have-nots in America to act as a backdrop to a story that has no purpose other than to make us wince and squirm. Director/co-writer Todd Philips' most famous contribution to cinema has been the Hangover series. His writing partner, Scott Silver's last movie, The Finest Hours, lost $50,000,000.00 in the US. Hollywood studio heads, if you don't understand the anger of female writers and directors in Hollywood, take another look at Scott Silver. Yes, he was nominated for an Oscar for The Fighter, but there were three other writers on that script. Seventeen years ago, he wrote a hit movie, 8 Mile. Since then he has done nothing of note, yet here he is co-writing a big-budget movie and making a mess of it.I emphasis the creators because this is one of the most poorly written scripts I have even seen made into a big-budget movie and I have seen some doozies. This is a movie that made me run home to shower. It is such an ugly look at the world that there is nothing at all that is redeeming about it. The most shocking moment is when we see Mr. Phoenix in his underwear - he looks seriously ill, almost malnourished. And his excesses don't stop there - his is one of the most undisciplined performances I have ever seen.I have to mention the score because it is as bad as the rest of the movie. Written by Hildur Gudnadottir, it stops and starts and then disappears then BANG! BOP! Then it's just gone. Two words came to mind when it was over - thank god.Joker is a world-wide hit. Some would argue that is the proverbial bottom line - who cares that it's not only junk, but evil junk, lots of people have gone to see it. Lots of people, in the past, have gone to hangings, beheadings, bear baitings and public burnings too. I am certain most people went to see Joker thinking they were going to see the Batman franchise Joker who had been played thrillingly by Jared Leto, Heath Ledger, Caesar Romero and Jack Nicholson. Well, the joke is on them. Us. Me. You."
118,"I saw the joker last night and was highly disappointed. Possibly the worst joker movie I've seen. I suspect after the hype dies out it'll go down to 7 on imdb.SPOILERS BELOWI concede the movie had some interesting moments and attempted touch on mental health. I'll ignore the marxist undertone of the rich as the evil oppressors and the poor as the good oppressed and the mask wearing protagonist violent protestors who kill cops.The main reason I disliked the movie was because the joker was in no way a genius super villain who could outwit other characters and the audience with his cunning intelligence. He was a sob story loser. He was in no way in control of anything that happened to him in his life and everyone got the better of him and he just took it. Even his co-workers quite easily outwitted him and caused him to be fired. He was just a sad dude. He was even bullied by a bunch of teenage kids who took his sign. What did the evil genius do? He ran after them and got the sh$@ beat out of him. Eventually when his medication ran out he started killing people and by pure luck he killed three rich men which led to his fame. Even his own fame was a complete coincidence and completely out of his control.This joker will have no chance of fighting Batman. By the time Bruce is in his 30s and becomes the batman the joker will be in his 60s, at least. The only thing this pathetic joker will be fighting is PTSD and back problems."
119,"This was one of the worse movies I have seen. It was over acted by all actors, the story dragged on and on. I saw this movie for a bargain matinee and thought I was ripped off! The only good part was the comfy chairs and the half priced snacks!
Phoenix was so over the top and not in a good way. PHOENIX STOP DANCING!!! Deniro played another version of all the parts he has played in the past few years!
2 stars for the chair and 1 star for the snacks, -1 stars for wasting my day!"
120,It's just that boring. really can't understand what the hype is all about??!
121,"I didnt really know much about this movie. I hadnt seen any trailers for it or anything but i decided to give it a go while i was stoned with my mate Steve. we actually got tickets for a different movie but couldnt find our screen so we ended up in the screen showing The Joker. It wasnt til about 45 minutes in that I realised this movie is no good. I couldnt understand a lot of what certain actors were saying it was really mumbled and low quality. The story is so confusing its hard to keep track of who's who. There's a lot of scenes where literally nothing happens except for people talking or walking down corridors. I whispered to my mate Steve about an hour in to see if he thought it was as bad as i did, but he had fallen asleep.The good thing about the movie is the acting. the geezer who plays the joker is very good at it. Also there is a few very funny scenes near the end but other than that this movie is overly long, too complex, not enough action, and poor directing."
122,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Ok, maybe not but they hype surrounding the movie killed it for me. It's not a masterpiece but an ok film. Why the one star? Way too many 10's! For once I actually agree with the actual critics who graded this film."
123,"What can I say about it that hasn't already been said? It's not a terrible film, but it's not a great (or even a really good one) either. The technical aspects are great. The score and cinematography are really good. Many individual scenes are also good. But as a whole, it just feels unnecessary. Not just that, but tone deaf as well. What it's trying to say about mental illness is problematic. Why? Because it's not really sure what it's trying to say or if it's even trying to say anything about it at all. Instead, it was added in there because, well, it's easy right? Joaquin Phoenix really does excel in many scenes of the film, but I'm not sure I would want him winning an Oscar for this. Overall, it's also just not that interesting. It's kind of... boring at times. And for a Joker film to be boring? That's a crucial offense. And I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I seriously wonder if those people calling this a ""masterpiece"" have even seen Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy."
124,"Film was directed and produced poorly. Opportunity to take advantage of the incredible Joaquin Phoenix was blown.Gratuitous violence. Misplaced violence. Wrong approach to joker.Disappointing connection to viewer. Film was wandering for long periods. Tons of footage that should have hit the cutting room floor.I really wanted an stirringly creepy connection with Joaquin as Joker. It wasn't there.If you are looking for Joaquin moment like in Gladiator, you will be very disappointed."
125,This movie is poorly done as to how it tells the story. It is a dark movie showing the problem of mental illness
126,JOKER is a gift to the audiences. I felt as a privileged person to sit in a movie theater and watching it. Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips gave to the world of cinema a rear pearl. I don't know what people are complaining about: this is really something else.
127,"It premiered last night in Sydney and I was lucky enough to watch this masterpiece first hand.
The movie is flawless but because of its approach on mental illness and the execution of Joaquin Phoenix. The 80's settings brings a darker filter to it, creating a scenario where you see no hope for a person as the main character to survive.
The movie does not praise violence and it's far from being about making the Joker a ""hero"" or him starting a movement, it's all about a man trying to find himself. Violence is what happens in between and labelling the movie as such is a misinterpretation of the picture.
Also, if the movie had no reference whatsoever of the Batman universe it would work the same, it is a movie that sustains itself from beginning to end delivering frame by frame what it was meant to."
128,"Dark, depressing and unsettling film with a haunting score. Incredible acting, directing and screenplay. Joaquin killed it. 5 out of 5 stars! Mental health is so important guys!!!"
129,"Wow, it takes a while to find the right words to describe this movie. It's different! It feels like a character study, almost like a documentary but at the same time as if you'd be watching a horror drama movie as intense as it is and realistic.
It touches on mental health issues which sadly this country is struggling with but won't admit to it. This film has the best character development I could possibly think of! Now I will say this:
JOKER is the last movie you'd ever want to show to kids! Not even teenagers should see this! It might be a tough one for them to see as it is brutal, bloody and might even be simply too much to handle. I saw some walk out of the theater and if you're a very sensitive person you might do the same! However, it is by far the best film and performance of the year and there's no doubt Joaquin Phoenix should win all awards for this including the Oscar! And in my opinion while it is a different take on the JOKER, this is the best portrayal of the JOKER.
Go see this with an open mind, and if possibly without expectations. This will definitely spark many conversations and most likely arguments as well."
130,"Why does this movie exist? Who does it exist for? Why do people love it so much?These questions reverberated inside my head as it played in front of me. I was waiting for a moment where I would be awestruck, blasted by its sublime genius that so many people had trumped up or maybe even worried by the philosophy that so many people were worried about.I felt absolutely nothing.Joker might seem like a good movie if you've never seen Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy. But here's my struggle. Those movies have something to say. Something to prove. They aspire to be art when this film is simply commerce.If you think this is a good film, tell me what it has to say. Tell me the meaning of it and why it exists other than, ""The Joker is cool"" or ""This is the Joker's origin story."" What is the purpose of watching a man's horrible life that never gets better and only gets worse and then the lives he touches get destroyed along the way.I mean, is it a cliche to use that sound and fury signifying nothing quote when this movie is so rote that it uses the song ""White Room"" in perhaps the most obvious of ways? Nothing is unexpected. Nothing is unique. This movie is the definition of wallpaper, albeit wallpaper bought by a tween at Hot Topic because they desperately yearn for something, anything, to make them seem different than the herd while mooing their way through the fields of utter boredom.Director Todd Phillips started his career by directing Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies while he was still a junior at NYU. His second film, Frat House, won the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance before HBO bought it. It never aired, as many of the film's participants claimed they were paid to enact the scenes in the movie.A third film, the Phish-following Bittersweet Motel, was his last documentary before making the movies Road Trip and Old School for producer Ivan Reitman. His career since has been a series of successes, like Starsky & Hutch, School for Scoundrels, Due Date and The Hangover series.Which brings us to this movie.It's written by Scott Silver, who wrote 8 Mile - good - and X-Men Origins: Wolverine - bad. He also wrote The Fighter, which won him an Oscar nomination.I always feel like you should say something nice first.So here's goes.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is great. It's acting desperately searching for a better movie to be in. His goal was to play a character that audiences couldn't identify with - that seems odd for the main role in a movie - studying assassins instead of people who had played the Joker before.He plays Arthur Fleck, who starts out the film as a party clown and aspiring stand-up comedian who lives with his mother Penny (Francis Conroy, every season of American Horror Story). A disorder causes him to laugh out loud for no reason and he depends on the government for his meds.An attack while working as a clown leaves him needing a gun, a gun that falls out of his pocket while working in a children's hospital. He also begins dating his neighbor Sophie (Zazie Beats, who was in Deadpool 2 and Slice) and finds that a video of him on stage has gone viral, ending up on his favorite TV program, The Murray Franklin Show.The fact that Robert DeNiro is inversing his The King of Comedy role, playing Jerry Langford instead of Rupert Pumpkin, is the type of creativity normally reserved for college freshmen who believe they are the first people to ever read Herman Hesse.Arthur is beaten up by three drunken Wayne Enterprises businessmen. He shoots two of them in self-defense before feeling so good about himself that he kills the third. This leads to Thomas Wayne - who Arthur's mother believes is her son's father - denouncing whoever did this killing as a clown.Soon, people are rioting in the streets wearing clown masks and Arthur is finally feeling like his life has meaning. However, two Gotham cops visit his mother, looking for the killer of the businessmen, and she has a stroke. This causes Arthur to either go off the deep end or become sane, as his meds have run out. He realizes that he has no girlfriend and that everything in his mind has been a lie.This brings him to The Murray Franklin Show, where he embraces the name The Joker, inciting another riot that also leads to Joe Chill killing the Waynes inside Crime Alley after a showing of Zorro The Gay Blade. Yes, that really happens.Another potentially crazy person was angered by this movie. Jared Leto, who portrayed the Joker in Suicide Squad and reportedly sent used condoms and dead rats to his co-stars, was alienated and upset by the fact that Warner Brothers was making a Joker movie without him. He even left his agents over this and attempted to get people to cancel this movie.I've heard words like groundbreaking and Oscar being thrown about because of this movie. As a society, we've really devalued those two words, huh?This is a movie that may not even be about the real Joker. It might not even connect to anything. And it's a movie about a man forgotten and thrown away that becomes somebody before being nobody. It's also a waste of two hours of your time.Man, I should work in some other nice things. The cinematography feels large in scope, when so many other films seem small these days. I also loved seeing the old Warner Brothers logo.I mean, this won the Gold Lion at the Venice Film Festival. It also had an eight-minute long standing ovation.I sat there waiting, hoping, struggling to find one moment of entertainment and relevance and walked away saying, ""That was a movie."" It should be something more.Instead, I'll have to see people wearing this costume and thinking it has some significance. These are the same people who think naming the comedy club ""Pogo's Comedy Club"" is daring because it references John Wayne Gacy instead of hammer soft irony.We deserve better and have become so mired in the dross that we think that movies like this are worth something. I'm not being an elitist - I love popcorn films and if you read this site you know I have a soft spot for Italian horror and 80's slashers - but when I see something that is s***, I have to call it the purest s*** I've seen in years."
131,"I didn't spend any money to see this movie until it was completely free for me but I still find it a waste of a ticket and my time. A while back we had gone to see a movie and then messed up my blind fiancé's audio device that gives him descriptive audio for the movie and since they couldn't get it to working For a good chunk of the movie they had given us free movie tickets for a future showing.So even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time no I'm busSo even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time.You really couldn't feel bad for this character at all. And I see no connection between him and the Jokers of the past. This portrayal of the Joker is a dishonor on the original Jokers. When I went to my parents house after the movie I knew my dad had been considering going to the movie and I walked in and said don't waste your money dad just wait for it to come out on demand or on Netflix.I mean you can't even connect with this character on any level. And the way they per trail mental illness is just not realistic. He was just a creepy jerk. He needed to be locked a way like his mother was. But in his case he just needed to be locked up permanently in a mental facility. And at the end of the movie how they tried to make it all just because he was abused as a child. It didn't even connect up with him to make it change any opinions towards him because the things he was doing don't line up with a reaction to abuse as a child. Watching this movie really just felt like you were watching a movie about ""The day in the life of Creepy Pedophile"". They try to make it so you feel sorry for him but it just doesn't do that.So in my opinion even if it was free like it was for me it's not worth your time and money. if it wasn't for the fact that I was there with my fiancé for his birthday I would've walked out of the theater. So on a scale of 1-10 stars I'd give it 10 thumbs down. This movie is a piece of crap. Honestly when I watch ""Descendants 3"" babysitting this week that movie was way better than this one and this was one of those strait to tv Disney Channel movie and was a Second sequel. But seriously I enjoyed watching that movie babysitting more than I like the Joker. The joker sucked that bad."
132,No one cares about your country's inability to separate Reel and Real influences. Film is a medium not just for political ideals or comments.Watch it
133,"I can't believe that such a totally perfect and spectacular movie I just saw, I am completely stunned. This movie needs to be in the Oscars. Nominated to:This film must be nominated for the following awards:
Best movie
best Actor
Best screenplay
Best address
Best Adapted Screenplay
Best soundtrack
Best sound mixing"
134,"In Gotham City, the clown and aspirant comedian Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is an outcast mentally disturbed man that lives with his deranged mother Penny Fleck (Frances Conroy). When the social service office that attends him is shutdown, Arthur stops his medication and the abusive society drives him crazier to a criminal life.""Joker"" is a dark and depressive film that discloses a dramatic version of the Joker´s origin. Joaquin Phoenix has a top-notch performance in the role of a mentally disturbed man disregarded by the society with a nervous twitch. His acting makes the viewer recalls and compares with Heath Ledger in ""The Dark Knight"", the best so far. The dark and gruesome cinematography shows a dirty Gotham City with the garbage collector strike. The music score is also spectacular with hits from the 70´s and 80´s. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Coringa"" (""Joker"")"
135,"This movie was so boring, I kept falling asleep. I felt very awkward several times. My son & I kept looking at each other like should we just get up & leave? I probably should have. I cant believe some of the reviews on here. People have very crappy taste apparently. Just shows you, don't believe the reviews. If a movie speaks tour interest, go see it for yourself. This movie however, I wouldn't recommend. It's a total bore."
136,"I just didn't get the hype about this movie. And why are we entertaining such violent movies. It wasn't nearly as good as I expected it to be. No doubt the acting was good, but apart from that there's no story. It's dark depressing movie, about a guy who's dealing with bipolar disorder and killing everyone around him, including his Mother. What kind of negative message is it passing on to the society."
137,Joaquin Phoenix's acting was outstanding but the movie just sucked... the laugh got annoying and it made the joker out to be a pussy. The ending he kills the talk show host?? Wow that was just anti-climatic overall just a waste of time to be honest.
138,"I made an imdb account after watching this movie. It was that terrible. Watching Joaquin Phoenix do interperative dance and try really hard to play an effeminate mentally ill person. The change into the Joker never felt earned. The movie itself was predictable and forced. A try hard edgelord masterpiece. Surprised he wasn't wearing a fedora. This movie just doesn't get the joke, because it IS the joke."
139,"About as sophisticated and nuanced an exploration of violence, poverty, abuse, mental health and This Political Moment as any other todd phillips film but i guess im supposed to take it seriously because it wears much better films like a shoddy human skinsuit, puts some moody strings on the soundtrack and knows how to mimic a color palette. i would truly like to know what it is that people find ""daring"" and ""complex"" about this considering that beyond its hollow replication of style it ultimately boils down to an insanely simplistic ""impoverished material conditions... bad imo... expressing rage towards the people directly responsible for those conditions? also bad imo."" a genuinely troubling joker movie would be more morally confused and ambiguous than this centrist scold (it's strange to me that people are saying that it is considering how painfully overt phillips' THIS. IS. BAD. gestures are), it would be interested in a thornier, righteous rage or how fleck's violent actions are tied to an ideology and then having us understand how his alienation attracted him to it but instead they've went completely literal and apolitical; to the point where they have him... straight up say this in his big monologue at the end, the last line (joke?) of which btw is some of the most embarrassing writing i've seen this year. and not to mention it makes zero sense in the context of the film when it arrives, i get that the character of the joker is supposed to be apolitical, anarchy or ~chaos~ or whatever but the film spends most of its runtime quite literally showing us (and having us empathize with) the very real class and political reasons that drive the actions he's taking so it doesn't really work here??? it just solidifies how all the elements that are meant to provide this with a ""real"", gritty texture (the class dynamics, for example, which are supposedly making this such a brilliant character study) are nothing more than decoration to move the absolute safest, most boring, status quo  imaginable that just constantly insists that it's taboo. and people are believing it at its word for some reason?? luckily for the film phoenix is about as good as one could be with writing this moronic and implies a much better movie but every critic who suggested this was ""dangerous"" and not just the lamest posturing nonsense should lose their jobs."
140,"If you like movies with no story and 2 hours of blah blah nonsense, this is for you! It was by far the most boring movie of 2019. A Joaquin Phoenix who overjusts, he wants to look like Depp? Of course, I understand the story of isolation and the psychological side. But what makes this film so special that it deserves a score of 8.8? Because of Joker's laughs? Because he shot people? The dark side was much better worked in Dark Knight Rises, here we are in a dark register, gore, depressing. Strange that this film is marketed in the United States when we see that it prone the ideology of Marxism.
Only the Joker had a character development. All other characters are boring stereotypes that do not contain a single story.
The cliffhangers are all predictable!
To conclude, I do not see this Joker fighting Batman at all."
141,"JP has one and only acting register : the depressed looser, I don't understand the critics he is as mediocre as always. Save your money and re-watch Heath ledger's joker."
142,"This has to be the dumbest DC movie yet. Way to miss the opportunity. First the Joker character is all wrong, this depicts Joker as unintelligent person with no wit. WRONG Joker maybe insane but his wit and intelligence is what makes him the master criminal that keeps batman on his toes. His ability to always find way out of being locked up was not demonstrated at all. The bar was set high with Joker in suicide squad and they didn't come close to the epic legend."
143,"I'm 36 now, this is my first review ever. Only because I'm sick of all of this. I don't want to sound like an old, miserable man. But Hollywood is failing on me, time and time again.Just to name a few: the last Blade Runner, the last Star Wars, Toy Story 4, Avengers Infinity War, Endgame, etcetera, etcetera. All the big ones. Disappointment after disappointment. And then there's Joker. I hoped it was the exception... But, no.Apparently, the only way to get good reviews is by hyping and trolling the media and with that, people's opinions and wallets. It's too easy, too boring, too shallow.Where are the storylines? In all of the above there is none to be found. No plot whatsoever. No rememberable scenes or quotes. Empty. Nada!It's even the opposite of a plot: all these movies just don't make any sense. These so-called 'plots' are written in meeting rooms. Bad, bad compromises that only check all the boxes for the laws of Hollywood. And people fall for it.And I just wonder if I'm the only one who thinks:
1. Joker is a joke
2. Hollywood is a joke
3. Review systems are a jokeThis makes me realize it's not just in the cinema that people let themselves be fooled. Think about elections.And this review will be trolled as well. Keep thinking for yourselves guys!"
144,"Not sure what kind of message this movie is supposed to send. Or is it supposed to be just fun, because it's not. I don't sympathize with the main character at all, throughout the whole movie he would get on my nerves. I was waiting entire time for the plot to start revolving and when it finally did, the movie was over and left me with a feeling that I've waisted two hours of my life on nothing. For a movie with this high rating I expected to see something fresh and inspirational and somehow it seems to me all the scenes and acting I've seen in this movie I saw a thousand times in bunch of other movies, like it was cliche after cliche. Yawn festival."
145,"I feel the best movies are complex and make you feel a range of emotions such as love, empathy, pity, joy, hatred, etc. The joker I found to be a series of unbelievable cliches . So the joker is poor and has some menial jobs and everyone in society is mean and abusive to him including his mother. I did feel sorry for him but at the same tine it shows his mental issues probably keep him from living a normal life. I did feel empathy for his plight but I didn't feel that society would get behind him as a ""hero"" for killing 3 people randomly on a subway. Also I found it ridiculous when the mob attacked the cops as if everyone in society hates cops. It was a trite Hollywood take on rich people are mean and awful to people who are poor (which I find hilarious given that everyone in Hollywood IS rich) . It was unrealistic from many angles and I wished I hadn't wasted my time watching it."
146,"My husband and I went to see this film and found it extremely depressing. Moreover, everything is caricatured. What could be more normal, you might say, given that it was a depicting the life of a comic book clown?
Christopher Nolan, the director of the famous Batman trilogy, said before it was produced that this movie would be useless. Simply because when it comes to horror, the less you show, the scarier it is. If you're told that there is a giant monster in the woods and it eats people, you'll laugh and not believe it or you'll imagine the most horrible monster there is; the most horrible according to you! What others show us is never as horrible for us as what we imagine.
Here, to make things really awful, we sink into the worst possible melodrama. As if psychopaths had all been mistreated during their childhood, mocked in adolescence, misunderstood in adulthood without ever having anyone to help them effectively! But no, the vast majority of them were born with a missing bolt in their heads. Something was wrong in them from the start.
Here, the director wanted to make us cry by portraying roughly the most cartoonish misery. Everything is in bold capital letters, underlined and highlighted to be sure that we fully understood that the main character didn't have an easy life and that our society is so rotten that we should all revolt and suicide out of desperation or kill each other to put an end to it all. ""Why so serious ? ""asked the Ledger Joker. And that's a good question, because I'm worried about the future of this character, especially for the actors who will want to play him.
In terms of the actor's performance, that's Joaquim Phoenix pushed to the extreme all over. In all his films I remember, this actor plays social misfits, loners unable to make friends, depressive people or on the verge of a nervous breakdown, misunderstood guys, sons rejected by their fathers, rebels, etc. In short, he only plays tortured souls. He even played a guy who falls in love with his computer because he can't get along with a real girlfriend. So it's normal that he knows how to play a crazy clown. Talent? If you will, considering the fact that he seems unable to play much else.
This simplistic and gloomy depiction of society has already claimed victims. There are people who dress up as clowns and ransack everything in the streets and cinemas where the film is shown. It seems that some misfits wanted to believe that, as with the Joker, their misfortune depended on everything and everyone else. Their happiness couldn't certainly be up to themselves.
Anyway, don't believe the good things that are said about this movie. And if you feel a bit out of sorts, don't go to see it, you'll make yourself more unhappy for a film that's really not worth it."
147,"This movie is everything that's wrong with Hollywood.
Indulgent, pretentious, overly long and very very dull.
The luvvies, the shallow and the right on brigade will love it.
No doubt Oscar winning stuff.....lets get the virtue signalling started now"
148,"DO NOT go and waste your money there... the film is boring boring boring at the end of the movie I was still waiting for the crimes, thriller scene and drama is bad bad bad...."
149,Without doubt one of the best movie's that I've ever seen!
150,"Take a character that has been around for decades in print, and a few movies, throw away any bit of canon, force in a sub story that damages the image of a character (Thomas Wayne), and use all that to make a slow, depressing movie about mental health that would have made 1/20th of the gross if you hadn't thrown in the DC references, and you have ""Joker"""
151,"As they say, it's been a pleasure. Well, it hasn't. Fine acting, cinematography but beyond that it's a little off the hook over the top.Firstly, he seems 40+ atleast & in these long years as him being him surely faced multiple social awkwardness & behavioural traumas which have made him adapt & understand the world around. But it the movie it looked like he was born yesterday & all the mean things happening for the first time right when the plot started.
The crazy behavior looked unnecessary, forced & unrealistic as mentally challenged folks keep social distancing, don't believe that loud in public. Just because you want to put a crazy guy on screen doesn't make it justified.
Secondly, his anger towards society was unclear. He had his mother, a job best to his potential along with a home given the entire city was all hell loose. What's he complaining about, anyways.
Third, Gotham city is no Buddha city and by judging the madness around why wouldn't you search a guy before letting on national TV more so as the sole reason for him bieng invited to the show was him being wack job.There are certain points worth mentioning.
1. Long.
2. Dull storyline.
3. Pointless plot.
4. Misinterpretation of human psychology.
5. Unpleasant to watch.
6. Unjustified character development.
7. Being silly, when someone fires a gun on LIVE TV you don't send one cop car.
8. Lastly, how in Gods name did the two investigating officers landed up asking for him regarding the subway shootout while half the city is on rampage?
9. Did anyone else observe Joaquin's body was all bones yet his cheek fat intact. Strange anatomy.Go watch it or don't. Your choice. Judge yourself according to your taste & pocket. Good,Bad are abstract concepts. Each has it's own opinion & logic based on it's level of knowledge. Don't buy along the concept of influencer.
Lastly, Joaquin did do some fine fine acting.
Thanks for reading."
152,"Basically a bad remake of taxi driver with bits of King of Comedy thrown in to replace the underage prostitute parts ... oh and lets throw a little batman stuff in there too to link it to those popular superhero movies .
problem is unlike Taxi Driver the main character is very unappealing , unlikable , and hard to sympathise with ... not just getting retribution on those who have wronged him Bronson style - he's more American Psycho killing basically innocent people for fun . Glamorising violence against inocent people by the mentally disturbed not a great message to be putting out there nowadays .
also wayyyy too much time wasted on Phoenix dancing and mugging to the camera - they could have cut out 45 minutes and still made the same movie just less long and boring ."
153,"The Joker won. Absolutely tremendous, what acting skills are we talking about ? It is amazing!"
154,"Phoenix is great. The cinematography as well. That's it.The world described in the film is not realistic, despite what they try to *tell* you. They don't show, they never show. Everything that happens is finalized to sustain Fleck's downfall. It's not organic, it feels forced. A lot of ideas, none of them explored sufficiently.The movie is basically an amalgamation of Taxi Driver and King of Comedy. Too many scenes that were ""inspired"" by those two great masterpieces, that deal with these matters in an actual thoughtful and mature way.
This truly is the ""we live in a society"" film.I wanted to like it, I really did. I couldn't. I'm sorry? Go cry in the corner, if you're offended by my opinion."
155,"I was very excited about this movie when it came out in theaters and after all the raving reviews I was even more excited. I never got a chance to watch in the theater and I'm very glad I didn't. This movie was 2 hours, that felt like 4, of flat boring plot. Literally nothing happens in the movie. All it is a very mentally ill insecure man talking to a therapist, laughing, and killing people. Arthur's laugh is terrible and annoys me throughout the whole movie. Arthur has no depth or personality. This movie was so boring I started falling asleep. Anyone who things those movie is a deep and meaningful masterpiece clearly has not seen other movies. I can list off so many other movies that are much more moving and deep than this. All this movie does is try to show that the villain, The Joker, from the comics is a distraught weak man. But in reality the joker from the comics is anything but that. He was crazy but a compete mastermind. The 11 Oscar nominations are idiotic because this movie is anything but Oscar worthy."
156,"It's a really good film that conveys a relevant message. But it plays fast and loose with ""show don't tell"" while bridging the gap between one part of the story and the next. You might find yourself asking ""wait... how did things blow out of proportion so quickly?"" in regards to the world around Joker, and not really finding much of an answer beyond a couple of off-hand explanations."
157,"This Is without a doubt the best protryal of the joker, the way he slowly gets turned by society and becomes skinnier and crazier,defenanrly one of the if not the best movie of 2019"
158,"There was nothing mentally or emotionally intriguing about this film. Outside of the amazing lead acting, this movie's only suprise was that a known antagonist was the main character.
The script was lackadaisical. The events were over dramatized and intangible.
As a person who's suffered from mental illness myself, this movie did not portray a mentally ill person. It exponentially exaggerated what goes on with in the mind of the victim. Those who enjoy this portrayal are likely the non victims.
As for how the comic book character was written: this story did adapt the idea that the joker knows he's a villain and enjoys it. At the end Arthur is still just a guy going to extremes to be accepted by society, instead being the joker who reshapes/exposes society to be something he thrives in."
159,"If Todd Phillips wanted to spend $55 million on creating yet another pointlessly glorified, anti-hero and attempt to pass it off as a case study of a mentally ill agent being displaced by society, he could've at least spent a portion of that budget employing people who are able to contribute honest, fair, and much-needed portrayals of actual disaffected minorities in society."
160,A breath of fresh airThink heath ledgers joker in taxi driver with a game of thrones like soundtrack
161,"The whole point of this movie is to bring attention to mental illness (I'll do you one better and name a bigger issue than mental illness that the film barely focuses on; the lack of quality mental healthcare) but the film completely discredits its own message with a one dimensional depiction of most of the world and characters that inhabit it. It seems that Gotham and its citizens (the entire universe for that matter) only exists to put Arthur down and considering the film isn't told from Arthur's perspective, it is a blatantly stupid depiction of the world. The reason why people liked it so much is because the sad corporate slaves (especially the youth currently being indoctrinated) were subconsciously tricked into believing they were part of some bigger cause when they were really just sitting in their comfy chairs."
162,"If it had not been for Gotham surroundings and the presence of The Wayne family, this sad joke of a film could have been just a flat portrayal of some sad loser with mental issues...But where is the criminal mastermind and superintelligent vilain ? Is this sad sick loser supposed to challenge Batman ?How ? In his dreams maybe ? Btw. What was the end supposed to show? That this was an illusion all the way ?
Did Hollywood forget the first rule of film entertainment? That the film is supposed to entertain you ? This rule goes for comics genre too! But where was entertainment in this ? If you want to make a film about a mental case turning into a murderer why exploit the comics genre and famous brands such as Batman or Gotham City? Here is the answer: nobody would be interested....sadly, such Joker is not interesting either..."
163,"Hated was looking forward to it. Its not for anyone to watch. Promotes hate violence suicide and Murder.
Please pick another movie to go to. Not sure what movie the other people were watching."
164,"With that being said. This is not a comicly accurate movie. It is a movie about man named Arthur fleck. Who is a clown that is a depressed person who fails at life. It's modern day Hollywood trash. With all due respect to Phoenix for trying... He is by far the worst joker because of the fake back story. Unfortunately the only real positive of this story is Robert de niros character... What a shocker a guy gets of his meds and kills a talk show host... I'm so shocked... Little does everyone know the real ""Joker"" falls into a pool of chemicals. At the location axis chemicals and becomes Joker. He doesn't take pills he doesn't kill people on Subways... Hollywood's version of joker falls short simply because of the story. Arthur fleck thinks Thomas Wayne is his dad? And Bruce Wayne is his brother because of his I'll mom? This the best story Hollywood got seriously? In all this is a movie about a guy portraying a clown that is having a downfall in life nothing more. If you are a true DC fan. Or resorc"

167,"That is best joker can i see
And joaquin phoenix will win the oscar"
168,"I am a simple guy. I watch films, I enjoy life's simple pleasures.One thing I despise doing in life (because it feels pointless) is being far too judgemental or complex as I watch a film that is portraying a message or story in its own way.Will I compare Rambo to Ace Ventura? No. Will I compare Saving Private Ryan to Endgame? No. I watch each film individually and if it completes its own mission of what it wanted to deliver, then I'm a happy bunny. I will not let life's current politics, or the sensitivity of the pathetic world's expectations to override a successful STORY. For me, a story is the most important part of a film personally.With that being said... JOKER is a successful STORY. In fact, I will call it a masterpiece because of how it delivers the realistic, sympathetic character build ups of one of the most popular villains in the history of time and space.And one of the main reasons I became attached and cared for the character was because of PHOENIX. What a fantastic actor. He nailed it. That is all I need to say. I absolutely loved the Dark Knight Trilogy and Heath Ledger's Joker... But where Ledger successfully gave us a realistic Joker for the first time, PHOENIX has now taken that championship with respect. PHOENIX has now given us the same in his own way, with a deeper and more engrossing background. Additionally, with an outstanding Joker performance (the dancing and laughing)... Absolutely spot on.The mystery of the Joker is still retained in this movie... And even though its an ""Origins"" story... I still feel like The Joker is a complete mystery.PHOENIX is in almost every scene, and its because of him and his execution and commitment to the role which makes this movie a standalone masterpiece. And it brings the respect back to The Joker character after that terrible representation of... What's his name again?If you want a super hero movie, this movie is not that movie. Joker's mission as a movie is to take the audience on a crazy trip inside the mind of the Joker... Its not about cinematics... Or explosions... Or gadgets... Or casting... It's about ""Why?""And now I see ""Why?""So now ask yourself... ""Why so serious?"""
169,"This movie makes him out to be a nervous child with pseudobulbar affect (pathological laughter). I understand what the movie is trying to point out, but it would have worked for me if it was not connected to the joker or dc comics. The Joker is a brilliant and ruthless criminal mastermind, so much of a genius Batman is the only one who can match him. This ""origin"" story does not create a Joker that could ever hope to be Batman's greatest enemy. He causes mass chaos in the city by mistake. A very slow burn for a very weak payoff, the ending should have been in the middle of the movie and gone from there. His makeup is that of a clown the entire movie never bearing any resemblance to any Joker i've ever seen. I can't enjoy a character who is ONLY a mental case, he is terrible at being funny, Heath Ledger's joker was hilarious without trying to be a comedian, he was funny in the moment, this Joker is too disturbed for comedy. A character like the Joker doesn't need an origin story it should be left shrouded in mystery. Joaquin Phoenix did a great job with what it all was, but it felt more like Taxi than anything else which to some is a success but I feel it's a failure in this case."
170,"Critics have just spoken. ""JOKER"" is already the ""#1 Movie in the Whole DC Universe"". It's an ""incredible DC film to watch"", Joker is now the ""Winner Golden Lion Best Film 76 Venice Film Festival"" ""Joaquin Phoenix is Astonishing"", it's ""Exhilarating"" ""A Masterpiece"", ""A Wild Card"", ""10/10"" ""Five Stars"" and it's now the ""#1 wining Major Oscar Buzz, at the Box Office, for the Best Joaquin Phoenix's Joker"", and Todd Phillips just dominated Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"". This is why you go to the movies, and put a smile on your happy faces to enjoy."
171,"As pointed out the story reveals a cynical perspective of a pointless protagonist that does nothing except react to its own environment. This is not a story; it's engineered agony.The technical aspects might be good, but it all means nothing if the story's garbage. It's like serving garbage on a golden plate. The plate is beautiful, great craftsmanship, but the garbage is still garbage.Movies communicate ideas about human life; why did the author think this is a story worth to be told? It preaches madness as a solution for evil. It preaches that self abandonment is the new cool. This sits right there with the new Star Wars that preaches that the hero doesn't need a journey - the hero gets everything on a silver platter, with no effort at all. What a messed up lesson for life.This movie has nothing to offer."
172,"As an DC fanboy lost hope on DC when they made JL, but i eventually started going back to the cinemas after Wonderwomen and Aquaman. When The Joker film was announced as Joaquin pheonix in the lead i must say i had my doubts. I was pretty sure noone could even match Heath ledger's Joker.. I was wrong. This might be the best DC film ever made! Joaquin pheonix did the impossible. Mindblowing performance as the joker! The best after Heath Ledger! Movie of the year! The laughs, screams, craziness and the dark psychological sufferings of the Joker will haunt you for the rest of the year. I must say The Joker is back! Trust me on this!
9/10 on this one!P.S This is my second 9/10 for a DC movie after TDK."
173,I have never been so moved by a fictional film. Truly amazing and im speechless.
174,"Read all you like about ""Joker"" - there is nothing that will prepare you for the gut-punch to come. This is less ""The Dark Knight"" and more ""Taxi Driver"" but make no mistake, it feels like the most original take you have ever seen on a well-worn genre. It is an uber-violent character study of a mentally ill man trying to survive in a bleak society that is failing him. It is an immersive and cathartic experience, and an enthralling and uncomfortable one for the viewer.If there is a more perfect performance than Joaquin Phoenix commands in this film, I would love to debate it. His depth and range is an acting masterclass and somehow demands empathy in a violent and disturbed character.Todd Phillips stamps himself as a modern master with this film. The look and feel of the film has such pace and menace, yet at the same time creates a claustrophobic atmosphere.It is a brilliant film. I hope people continue to see it as a cinematic masterpiece and it doesn't get caught up in politics or become part of a narrative of the sometimes flawed society we live in ourselves."
175,I'm amazed. I was shocked by how perfect Joaquin's acting was. I never imagined that I'm going too see such a good interpretation of my favorite villain. Thank you for everything!
176,"If you go to see this movie expecting the villain from the Batman universe, you won't find it. It is however a great movie about mental illness. Phoenix obviously studied the character quirks of people with schizophrenia. But the Joker should scare you, this guy just makes you uncomfortable. It doesn't AT ALL explain how an awkward loner turns into a charismatic criminal mastermind."
177,This movie was so slow... it felt like I had lost about 10 years of my life. The performances were good but it took so long to get to the interested parts. This movie was also super depressing. I could not get into it and didn't feel any empathy for the Joker. I was hoping that this would be better than wonder woman but it was worse
178,"Without a doubt, Joker is in contention for the film of the year.With Joachin Phoenix garnering praise left and right for Joker it's easy to dismiss the multiple other elements of direction, sound mixing, editing, cinematography, set and costume design and casting that make this a truly astounding piece of artistic cinema.
Joker is a film that without any one of these elements, it would fail. It would slip into the same bracket as Suicide Squad and be forgotten, but, fail it certainly does not.Joachin Phoenix is phenomenal. We know this already from pictures like Her and The Master, what we didn't know was how utterly deep and broad his range was. At points, I was totally absorbed by Joker. For the first time in possibly 10 years the movie theatre melted away, along with other viewers and noises and I was a part of that film. It was as if I was watching a documentary, rather than a fictional work. His commitment to the role, his weight loss and mental strain are dangerous but it produces something that no one ever thought would happen. It produces a performance that could genuinely rival Heath Ledgers.Todd Phillips direction and script are masterstrokes. If it were a painting it would be a Turner, with bright violent skies, and dark sad landscapes. His beautiful melting pot of inspiration features large doses of Martin Scorsese's 'The King of Comedy' and 'Taxi Driver', alongside the physiological battery acid from more recent pictures such as Fight Club and Black Swan.
It swirls together to birth this bitter, gritty, dark, mesmerising masterpiece, that both requires and demands, multiple, in-depth viewings.For me, what makes this film is the costume design and the cinematography. The design of every minute detail on each character to make Gotham look even more drab and dull, even more grimy and beaten down is exceptional. Similar to how Scorsese made Harlem and The Bronx look broken and corrupted in Taxi Driver, you feel physically dirty after watching numerous sequences and you feel pangs of genuine social guilt stemming from your own moments of awful selfishness.
The cinematography is astounding, and MUST be in contention for an Academy Award, alongside Best Lead, Best Direction and best Sound Mixing. Some of the shots could have been lifted from a Time Magazine piece on 'City Life' they're that artistically powerful. Whole, dialogue-free sequences that say far more with silence and sounds of a city teetering on the brink of oblivion in the background than anyone could ever say. The sound mixing to have conversations, telephones, car horns, shouting, trains prevalent in the background audio leaking into the foreground does what Nolan did in 'Dunkirk' and pushes further the feeling of strain. The idea that even noise is seeping in from the city and soon the barricade will break and it'll drown us all in it's filth, corruption and decadence.Joker is a true masterpiece. So dark, so dirty, so vindictive of a modern flawed and broken societal system, but it always reminds you:
Put on a happy face."
179,"Whether you end up loving or hating Joker, Todd Phillip's gritty and Scorsese like take on the legendary DC comics villain, there's no denying that the cinematic comic book adaptations landscape has been changed forever.Just as Nolan changed our expectations for what a comic book film can be with his Dark Knight trilogy, Joker's examination of the birth of a nefarious villain hellbent on chaos and anarchy is unlike anything we've ever seen before, stripping the well known character back to the bare basics as we're introduced to the sad life of the misunderstood and unloved Arthur Fleck.Sharing more in common with dramas such as Taxi Driver and Serpico, rather than it's other comic book cousins, Phillip's and his mindbogglingly good leading man Joaquin Phoenix take us into the mind of a broken man trying to fit into a world that doesn't want to open its arms to him, in what's an engaging, cant look away character study that slowly but surely descends into a dark and uncomfortable place that befits the name and reputation of its title being.It may seem far to early to call but I for one am confident in saying that Phoenix's full embodiment of Fleck goes down as one of the most singularly impressive acting turns of not only the decade, but all time.Similar to what De Niro did as Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, what Daniel Day Lewis did as Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood and what Pacino achieved with Sonny in Dog Day Afternoon, Phoenix commands every second of screen time he gets in Phillips dark tale, in what must surely be the biggest sure fire bet for an Oscar you could ever hope to get.From the way in which Fleck appears physically, from a simple walk, through to a slight facial tick, right through to a haunting and hard to forget collection of haunting laughs, Phoenix appears in virtually every scene of Joker and never ones fails to enthrall, and in doing so his managed to do the seemingly impossible of allowing us to understand a deeply flawed and depraved creature but a creature you begin to understand and at times even feel sympathy towards.For all the great incarnations of the character, it's hard to think of a better way in which the Joker could be born into existence and by bringing his own flavour and nuances to Fleck, there's no point in comparing Phoenix to Heath Ledger's iconic take on the face painted mad man, with this take a whole different beast entirely.As good as Phoenix is, it would've only taken the film so far had Phillip's and his team not come to the party but for a relatively small budgeted film, Joker's astounding overall quality ensures it can comfortably sit in the top class of 2019 films.It's amazing to think that this is a film from the same man that gave us Old School and The Hangover but Joker sees Phillip's grow into a whole new level with his on point direction, that fits perfectly with Lawrence Sher's eye-capturing 70's like cinematography and Hildur Guðnadóttir's memorizing score, giving Joker an epic and unforgettable cinematic verve that brings it's A game too match its captivating leading man.While first and foremost a believable tale of a man pushed to the edge of his already teetering limits, Joker also manages to throw in a number of surprising narrative and comic book throwbacks that will be no doubt be discussed ad-nauseam by die-hard fans and naturally tie together Fleck's story to a much broader universe without ever feeling forced or unnatural, all within a tale that is as confronting and even topical as you'd get regardless of genre.Final Say -Bleak, beautiful and boundlessly inventive, led by a Joaquin Phoenix performance for the ages, Joker is an outstanding cinematic achievement that's sure to be talked about for years yet to come.5 French Fries out of 5"
180,A movie worthy of an oscar. One of the best movie in superhero genre since The Dark Knight. Phoenix is the actor who was born for this role after Ledger.
181,"I've read so many 1 star ratings of people who shares the same mood as I do.
They have written so long points about the movie. This movie doesn't worth writing so long about it. Just trash. Rubbish."
182,"The Joker for me was a disturbing and sometimes hard to watch revision of the Joker that not many of us saw coming, Phoenix brought a great effort to the table, but it was somewhat miss-placed for hysteria and mental illness. The Joker has always been known to be cunning, intelligent and calculating so I was surprised they made the Joker out to be so spontaneous and mentally unfit considering what we know he is capable of in a myriad of comics and movies. I do not see this version of the Joker outwitting Batman and the city of Gotham's authorities, he seems to be far too convoluted in the sense that people get to him mentally and emotionally far too easily, he is unstable and not intellectual. Heath Ledger's Joker was and always will be the pinnacle of the Joker, the perfect balance of humor, wit and insanity, it should go without saying. This Joker was just too weird and disturbed to be anything but a sideshow freak."
183,"I saw the movie after the opening weekend and loved it. I think it's a masterpiece. Convinced my 65 year old mother too see it, who couldn't even remember whose nemesis the Joker is. She had read about all the negative press about the movie being too violent and taking light of mental health issues.She loved the movie. Sympathized for Arthur and was rooting for the Joker (to a certain point) She was surprised about the small amount of violence is depicted after all the press putdown and enjoyed the ""social commentary"" the movie conveys.Her score: 9 / 10Mom is always right."
184,"This movie is overrated......
Atract people to be crazy and encouraging them to be massy."
185,Cause it's not a joke.Marvel fanboy is crying right now
186,"I literally created an imdb account for the first time in order to attempt to warn people off of this terrible film. I have nothing good to say about it at all. It was a poorly crated story awkwardly told. The only saving grace is that Joaquin Phoenix acted an awful character in an awful story. I couldn't wait for the movie to end. I found it to be incredibly obvious and predictable for every ""twist"" in the film. The end credits were the best part when I finally was free. I was on a date or I would have just walked out early on."
187,"How can i speak something that my feeling cant even contain.. this is truly greatness.. a movie that moved you into something that you cant describe, so stressful, painful and sorrow, depressing, twisting, and oddly beautiful. Joaquin put act to another level, and de niro just fis right as always.. enjoy every scene, because everything may not as it seems"
188,"So it literally blew me off...phoenix has given something to cinema which was missing from a long long time!!
The movie got released today, and imagine a theatre full of people (in india) and clapping during the film means it deserves every applause.."
189,"This movie won't be felt only by those who suffer and feel such feelings as the character does...
It need some ill people mentally or physically who suffered during there life time to appreciate it.
And from the rating I believe that a lot of ppl have experienced such circumstances hence the sympathy towards it."
190,No surprises here. This was just the same idea played over over and over. How about that Joker Ballet in the toilet?! Hilariously bad.
191,"Disturbing with very little entertainment value at all. I'm sitting in the theater feeling extremely uncomfortable and my mind is wandering to all of the young, white, disturbed men that have senselessly murdered people in our country. I don't feel this film would illicit the same behavior with stable individuals but we cannot know what impact it would have on emotionally disturbed people. Parents please be aware of the content before endorsing this film for teens."
192,"Don't fall for it this movie is totally overhyped, borders between boring and irritating. Joaquin is good but the movie has no story and goes on aimlessly. Joaquin's behavior and crazy laughter is so repetitious. Who wrote those 10 star reviews?? Maybe family and friends of the people that worked on the movie??????"
193,Just went and watched the joker movie and it has to be the worst movie I have ever seen 1 out of 5 stars
194,"I was blown away by the script and performance.
Artistic, gritty, brilliant.
Oscar for Todd and Joaquin."
195,"I went to see this last night and I have to say I was really looking forward to it, when I came out of the cinema all I could think is why the hell did I want to go see that so much!!Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as Joker but thats pretty much the only positive I can say about this.The film is 2 hours long and I can honestly say I was totally bored for the first 90 minutes, the last half hour is better but not by much. I found myself looking at my watch thinking when is it going to start, where is the gruesome violence that apparently makes people leave the cinema, in short it's not really there, I think they were leaving because they were bored."
196,"Joker (2019) might be one of the most boring movies I've seen this year. It certainly gives Ad Astra and Hellboy a run for their money, at least.The slowness of the movie is accompanied with a score full of low notes on stringed instruments. You know, to give the impression that the movie scenes carry weight and importance. After hearing it for half an hour, it gets pretty old.Joaquin Phoenix was easily the best part of the movie. He clearly put a lot of effort into playing The Joker, but unfortunately, the script never elevates the character to be interesting or compelling. The majority of the interesting things in the movie happen to The Joker. The active choices Joker makes barely matter in the context of the film. The majority of the things we see Joker actually do are: smoking, dancing, running, getting beat up, killing, making bad jokes, and being alone. (In that order)The theme of ""Mental Illness"" is vaguely referenced multiple times in this movie. Ultimately, these references are so confusing, had no impact, and useless that they shouldn't have been there at well. (As opposed to Where'd You Go, Bernadette, where mental illness played an important and useful role) During the movie, social services get cut. But there are no consequences to this. In fact, by this point in the movie, Joker has already killed three people and started an imaginary relationship.Anarchy also plays a prominent role. Joker winds up starting an anarchy movement after he kills three Wayne Enterprises employees. During each interaction with or even seeing the anarchy crowd, he seems really pleased with the movement, and also shows a general displeasure with wealthy people. But whenever Joker is asked about his thoughts on the subject, he keeps saying he doesn't care about the politics. The message of the movie just ends up coming across as really confused because of a refusal to pick a side on anything and say something. On the surface level, it seems like the movie has a lot to say, because it keeps touching on these subjects. But it always leaves it up to the audience to determine what the film wants to say because the film says nothing.This is not a smart movie, or a powerful commentary. It's what Todd Phillips thinks that kind of movie looks and feels like. But hey, at least the cinematography was decent."
197,Joaquine phoenix's acting is just great and Todd Phillips direction and screenplay makes it even greater
198,"Strong fanboy and hype rush going on.
The movie is good don't get me wrong, the cinematography is amazing, the acting is brilliant, but the story is a bit predictable if you have an iq above 90. Its also really slow paced which can be annoying at times. Deff has it flaws and is in no way even comparable to Batman the dark knight. The movie is a 7 but I gave it a 6 to compensate for all the fanboy 10s"
199,"Just go see it.. The endFilm of the year by some distance, literally breathtaking performance"
200,"This was irresponsible filmmaking at its finest coming at the worst possible time. Todd Phillips should be ashamed. He had the opportunity to offer a positive message to people that see themselves in Arthur's shoes- people that have been wronged by the system and see no way out- and instead he reassured them that they are monsters and the only way they can ""win"" is if they get back at the society that wronged them in any way they can. He's a cash grabber that used his platform to tell an entertaining Joker story, instead of a deeper resonate message like it could have been. From an outsider's view, one could argue that this scenario is what happens when society fails, but this was not told from an outsider's view. This was told from the terribly empathetic Arthur's view, and so I see no reason why a potential school shooter wouldn't relate to him. This is saying to that person, it's better to be infamous than a nobody. It's a very dangerous message at this current time. For those that argue, it's only art, I argue that the mainstream media is potentially the most powerful force in the entire world. Personally, I feel that with great power comes great responsibility. Media makers have the right to make whatever they want, but they have the responsibility to use the power they've been given for good and this was completely the opposite...Objective review: Beautifully shot and acted, but super boring at times."
201,"Possibly the worst movie of the year
If Hollywood has to give an award to Mr. Phoenix is never late to reconsider another film that made.
why this film ?
why this character ?
Mental illness award ?
at the end of the film, you don't know if all is fiction of the disrupt mind.
SORRY TO PAID TO SEE THAT FILM"
202,"Some great moments, doesn't really live up to the hype though.
Phoenix's prediction of Joker's descent into madness was really interesting to watch and he will get many plaudits but the film felt like it was missing something. A few plot holes and areas where you feel like it's being dragged out longer than it needs to be. Definitely worth a watch, but don't go in expecting to see a 'film of the year'.
Ledger still on top."
203,"I.... I.... I have no words.... Because words alone couldn't describe how beautifully this movie is made... This is the lowest a man could go... While we do sympathize with Arthur, they also show us why we should never take the path he took.... The Joker's path... Every single actor nailed their roles and Joaquin must definitely win the academy this year... We could actually feel and go through his struggle and his pain... Like I said... Words doesn't do it justice... Go watch it... Experience it... And the last act of the film just blows your brain away (spoiler alert!!)"
204,"I have seen Jokers and this is not my joker. I know lots of reviewers gave this a 10 out of 10 score yet I almost walked out of the movie. It had no greatness for me. Phoenix did a great performance but it become too repetitious for me. Also, this guy had to have lost a lot of weight as he showed a shockingly thin body. I will say I enjoyed the credits at the end. The yellow lettering against the black background allowed for clean clear reading of all who worked on this movie. As the only dissenter in the reviews I am sure most will believe the others. Sorry just was not my cup of tea."
205,"Was really looking forward to seeing this film. However having seen it I am very disappointed
The acting was brilliant however I was bored unroll the last half an hour. I have never considered walking out a cinema until nowI would say you have to go and see it as you can see by the reviews some people love it"
206,"Barely any flaws the movie continues on the wright direction, As in the opening it brings a good depth to the character and his motivations for example in the murray franklin show where he takes the laughs with Murray and as soon as it gets to a climax the tone keeps up and including throughout the film we see the character in his histarical actions and his backround it has some flaws the film but we can ignore it do to the antipication and good acting the most important of all is the best picture tha t thi s movie really deserves the credit to became the marvelous joker masterpiece."
207,"There isn't anything new I will be able to add to the review of the movie Joker, but I'm here writing anyway. I guess that is suppose to mean something. It is a step away from Hollywood (in all the write ways) in that the script was well written and compelling enough that at times I was holding my breath. The camera shots were relatively standard I'd say, but the cinematography set the mood so well, changing as the story progressed in all the subtle but right ways, that it stood above most films made in the last couple decades.The director, Todd Phillips, isn't the type of person you'd think would be putting out this level of filmmaking, but War Dogs showed he was able to tell a compelling story and now we have Joker as the cherry. This movie is so masterfully crafted that return viewing will offer up new insights or perspectives; especially with the main character Arthur (Joker), but also how the city itself was used as a character. The pacing was overall good; some may say it was a slow burn, but I thought the ramp-up time added to the pressure building to the third act.Now one of my favorite movies."
208,Joker is actually the best movie of all 2019. Emotional rollercoaster with multiple emotions. Haunting and cringy grotesque. This is actually the best psychological thriller/drama I've ever seen.
209,"I have never seen a movie so ruthlessly hold up the mirror to society and humanity.
Joaquin Phoenix puts the performance of his life here.
I can understand that some people will have their problems with this movie.
But if it hadn't exceeded these taboos it wouldn't be the Joker."
210,"Outstanding! If DC bought and continued this arch from WB they actually could have a chance at Marvel.
A little bit of Hans Zimmer and you have a hit!"
211,"When I saw dark night, I thought it was the best DC universe movie but then joker came along .
The acting in this film hypnotised me."
212,"This is the movie where the audience will like Joker but hate Thomas Wayne, Batman's father when they see how uncaring he is. This movie is going to be a classic hopefully!"
213,"Joker is set in the early 80s of gotham city. a city filled with despair, piles of trash, and no batman( yet) we follow a man named arthur fleck. arthur is a lonely man with mental and physiological problems that is only trying to fit in. but the world keeps stepping on him. as one thing bad after another thing happens to arthur we slowly see him let go and see his decent into insanity.there is so much to say about this film. from the amazing cinematography to the phenomenal performance from phoenix. One thing that's so amazing about this movie is the parallels between arthur's life and at the end of the movie. everyone has a different ending. it leaves you with questions that make you ponder the whole movie. but in a good way. the writing is so clever, for example the staircase in this movie is used as a literary device for arthur's mental state, when he was struggling and felt he didn't belong we would heavily walk up those stairs. but when he becomes the joker, he dances down those same stairs, showing that he found himself. this movie is truly phenomenal and i suggest you give it a watch."
214,"All the silly kids and people masquerading as film buffs and critics, please just go back to watching your happy go lucky rom coms with happy endings. Just sit in your dark room with your keyboard and make as many comments as you like on marvel movies being the best things you've seen. Maybe even give your mother a shout for more meatloaf while you tell us your thoughts on how the best movies are all crap and delve into how profound Donnie darko was. Keyboard warriors always seem to have thee most ridiculous insights and views on movies. To say this movie is boring is a statement I will never get. And overrated? Don't get my started. There have been so much worse than this movie for that, try avatar, titanic, citizen Kane etc. Doesn't make them bad movies (with the exception of avatar) but apparently overrated means crap now. It's a huge movie franchise, of course it will be hyped up! We have another batman coming out already after only a few short years after the last one ffs. Do you think the marvel films or Star Wars will stop because there was an end game and ending to the skywalker saga? Nope. And do you think these movies wouldn't be overrated at some point? This movie DESERVES to be hyped up. Gotham has never looked more like it should as it does in both animation and in the Arkham game series. I would both love and probably hate there to be a sequel if you get my meaning. The joker is intriguing because of his mysterious past and beginnings, I think this was enough and if we did delve any further we would lose that mysteriousness, but you can't help a small part of you wanting to know more. I read one review where the guy watched it as a date night film and said they didn't like its dark nature and were bored. Who the hell watches this as date movie? Maybe a serial killer. Not exactly a movie to get u in the mood is it. Maybe try hostel or I spit on your grave for next week buddy. I should stop reading reviews on here, they just annoy me. It's worse than YouTube almost..."
215,"The viewer is uncomfortable starting the first few minutes but it is necessary for the message of the movie.
Very powerful and contemporary issues with sensational acting from Joaquim Phoenix."
216,"What a beautify tragedy that was. It was pretty dark. Go watch something light and funny after. Don't get me wrong, it's worth the watch."
217,Explains a lot and the story line moves at a good pace.
218,"Joaquin Phoenix is such a talented actor. Dark movie, but you will with no doubt be mesmerized by Joaquin's performance."
219,"This movie is so good...the cinematography,the acting,writing definitely the best movie of 2019"
220,"I want to start this review by saying i have been an avid marvel movie fan and for many years was embarrassed for DC in their attempts to catch up in the game. However, this film flipped the entire script! Marvel found a very good formula through directors such as the Russo brothers and writers such as Taika Waititi in which they combined elements of action, comedy and story to produce some very enjoyable films. Todd Phillips' take on Joker did everything right that DC films had been missing and then some. This film is not meant to give you that nice, warm feeling you feel walking out of a marvel film but to challenge your perception of society and the issues within it. It achieves this in waves and has allowed DC to achieve something marvel have lacked by suggesting the world we live in sometimes isn't worth protecting as it is. Joaquin Phoenix is of course exceptional in the role and approaches the role from a real understanding of what it entails. See this film and try not to feel anything, I dare you!"
221,"Best Joker I've seen, Joakim Phoenix does a very impressive role, movie as it is, is also very good, it's not like the Hollywood crap, that they usually do with comics."
222,"This movie is about the origin story of Joker.
Arthur Fleck, a poor fellow, who is abandoned by the society, chooses the path of destruction and becomes JOKER.This movie is Dark and Dramatic.Joaquin Phoenix has poured his heart out to live up the character of the joker. Todd Phillips has also done great work in directing the movie.This movie doesn't leaves any loop-hole and very well connects to the Batman story. I liked the Plot of this movie. It is realistic and stick to the ground.A Worthy Watch."
223,"This type of movie is a proof that good acting, screenplay and scripts do exist. What a great actor and performance."
224,"Despite the memes, this movie is tense and unsettling all the way through. If you like dark comedy and a good thriller, this movie is for you."
225,Is it 'enjoyable' - no. But it I did not take my eyes of the screen for a second as it was an incredible portrayal of descent into villainy.
226,Best joker ever!!!!! Emotionally brilliant watch this film!!!!! Best movie ever from the 2000s
227,An outstanding piece of art in every possible way. The conflict draws you in from the start and never let's you go.
228,Joaquin Phoenix KILLED his role in this movie. For sure did the best job in depicting joker. Well deserved Oscar on his part. The story was solid throughout and Robert De Niro was a good supporting actor. What's special about this film is you don't have to be a superhero fan to understand/enjoy the film. Very little parts have to do with Batman but that's it.
229,"As far as I'm concerned a tour de'force and not to be missed. Character,suspense,uncomfortable at times and emotional. If you like films and movies watch it. The acting is impeccable and one that will stand the test of time. Absolutely wonderful."
230,This my first time writing review about any movie here. Joaquin Phonix is a great actor. He perform very good acting. And this movie is one of the best movie this year. I just love it.
231,Good movie joker always wins;) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
232,"Amazing character work. Highly enjoyable movie despite the heavy content. Joaquin Phoenix is superb job as Joker. I've always been a big fan of him and I'm so happy that he finally won the academy award that he well and truly deserved.The writing and Phoenix's is character work as Arthur, who later becomes Joker is tremendous. Author has had an extremely difficult life and he struggles with his mental illness. He ended up committing crimes that definitely makes him a villain, but a villain he audience can sympathize with. It is not a story that encourages violence, but instead, it's a story that describes what kind of events can lead a good person to do horrible things."
233,Dark and very entertaining. Hoping for a joker 2. Would love to see Batman from the view of the joker
234,"This is a movie for those who likes a dark plot!The actors are amazing. The story is interesting and you never feel like its boring.The movie is like a rabbit hole, you just keep running and running but there is no end. It gets deeper and deeper, until you have arrived at the breaking point where he just snaps, and its beautiful.Thats all i have to say!"
235,"I want to know how anyone can NOT give this film a score of 10!
It's impeccable in every way! Long term fan of Joaquin, but here his acting culminates in the most amazing, Oscar worthy performance ever!Not everyone who watches Joker may be a Batman fan, and some may not agree with the storyline featuring him and Thomas Wayne. But if you can ignore the routes the other films follow and just immerse yourself in this storyline it makes perfect sense.It's a huge wake up call for mental illness and how it can be dealt with by society. Persecuted and beaten up for uncontrollable laughter! The epitome of negative attitudes towards those less fortunate.And no ridiculous storylines about falling into a tank of acid to become the joker. However I am not knocking the performance of Jack or Heath as the same character. Imo they were both equally as perfect in their own rights.The mere fact that the start and the whole film is Joker trying to write jokes and become a comedian, and has to go through a huge metamorphosis to become the character we all know and love, then refuses to tell his councillor at the end because ""she won't get it"" is the perfect anticlimax that he deserves!Acting throughout is flawless, the pace is perfect. I love the slowness. Because even tho you may end up aching in the cinema rafter watching it, the longevity of the story carries on for ages after you leave.It's a movie that you can watch over and over and really empathise with Arthur. A mentally ill person who is tarnished by a failing prejudicial society who eventually constructs a demonic, revenge fuelled monster. A perfect film. A perfect metaphor."
236,I found this film perfect the acting the sound track the story and I enjoyed it so much
237,"One of the best movie ever!
It's dark, it's beautiful in a dramatic way, it's sad, it's scary...
It's just one of the movie that you HAVE TO WATCH at least twice cuz you might missed something the first time!Of course Joaquin Phoenix is great, so is the director and the custom designer, set designer, the choreographer, the composer and so much more to make this another classic to go down the history!"
238,"I was not a fan of Joaquin Phoneix, but his performance was a career best and his Oscar win a big shock but well deserved. This is the darkest film since American Psycho with a true to characters story that has ever been told. Rejected by mother rejected by society and yet he still smiles. How this film never won best picture is all that's wrong with Oscars and they went with Green book to be safe. Robert de Niro always surprises me how good his acting is. They nominated The film Favorite instead of this film a film where a fat lady gets basted like a turkey and two women fight over right to do it."
239,"This movie is amazing. It highlights some key elements of mental illness and how it affects people. The only issue I have is honestly how much society has started reflecting the mass hysteria I thought we would only see in the movie. Current issues in America really made this movie even more real feeling, knowing we aren't far off at the moment."
240,"Lauded by critics and rightly so, what we have here is a frankly astonishing look at a man's spiral into madness thanks to a society that fails him. Joaquin Phoenix puts in perhaps the performance of his career, and despite being quite an uncomfortable watch you just can't look away. Essential viewing."
241,"I think it's understandable to see why people wouldn't like this movie, it's not a base villian orgin story that we expect from marvel or DC and I think many people expected that going in. The film is very uncomfortable and that's the point. At no point do you feel like the bad things Author is doing is ok, you know it's wrong but you have understanding on why this broken man is making these choices and the situations he's been forced into by predjudice and violence from an outside society. The praise for this movie is well deserved and the messages and themes are important and should be dissected. Though be really for a very bloody and intense experience."
242,"Like the headline says, messed up, interesting. No wonder Phoenix won an academy award."
243,"I heard all the hype about this film and as a skeptic at heart I came into this film with the most critical mindset possible.I just finished watching it and I am absolutely speechless. I don't think a film such as this has ever been made in Hollywood before. The slow and steady fall of the Joker into complete insanity is just so realistic that you feel a strange empathy towards him and almost come to justify his actions even when he commits the most heinous crimes. This is what makes this film so incredible, it takes the ""villain/good guy"" type of film making and just flips it right on its head.The cinematography captures this perfectly, you never feel rushed into a scene and yet it keeps you glued to your seat (thanks also to the music and score which contour this film perfectly).Joaquin Phoenix gives the performance of the century and only thanks to his brilliance is this film even possible. I feel sorry for the actors who gave Oscar-worthy performances this year, as Mr. Phoenix's acting in this film is just from another planet and deserves all the accolades it can get."
244,I Have rarely been as disappointed in a movie as i have been with this one. I went in expecting a deep interesting and entertaining movie. What i got was an awkward incredibly boring film. All that hype for something that is 60% the joker being awkward. I kept waiting for it to pick up and become interesting. I was expecting something on the level with Heath Ledgers joker but it failed to gain my interest in the least. Like many critically acclaimed films this movie was a complete joke to me.
245,"If you want to watch a superhero/villain movie, then go somewhere else. If you want to see a ""descent into madness"" movie, watch Taxi Driver instead. This is just that movie with more graphic violence and - oh yeah - instead of driving a taxi at the end, this guy puts on clown makeup.The movie was also way to political, and it's message is just the same rehashed junk you get from most Hollywood movies nowadays. Just with more graphic violence and - oh yeah - clown makeup.Phoenix does a fantastic job, which is why I gave this 2 stars rather than 1. But the movie is twice as long as it needs to be and is only half as good as it should have been. I'd rather take the 2 hours I sat through this to re-watch The Dark Knight, where we see the Joker that his movie should have been."
246,"The problem with this movie is that it is too real. Maybe way too real for some people to absorb. Maybe it scares them, maybe it intimidates them, maybe it sickens them, maybe they are forced to see some things that they are not ready to see or forced to believe some things they are not ready to believe. But not for a moment does it change the fact that it is REAL.This Joker IS NOT your typical 1st gen or 2nd gen Comic Book villain. This film does not follow your typical MCU, DC adaptations of Comics. This is no adaptation of anything you've read. There are no CGI effects. No half hour long fight sequences. No alien races coming to help. There isn't even a Batman to this Joker. This joker doesn't birth from a chemical accident, but rather from the conscious actions of a cruel society to a point where you have to make your imaginery comfort zone... then losing that too.The loneliness, the darkness, the emotions, the fall from grace so beautifully captured that it haunts you. The fall in darkness so black it upsets you. It poses questions that hurt your conscience... answers to which you would rather avoid.You can't watch it, and he lived it. And that is Joaquin's Joker... a monster made by YOU."
247,"10/10. The direction, the cinematography, the score, the overall acting and tone. This movie would have been great based on that alone, but the protagonist brings something never seen before on stage. I have watched almost everything there is to see, and I had never seen a performance like Phoenix's. Words can't really do it justice. Must watch. Oh and by the way, apparently, it is a comic-book movie. Not that you can tell by watching."
248,I read the reviews and rented the movie. I could not believe how bad this movie was. The story was boring. The Joker character was well portrayed but the lack of a story over shadowed The actors performance
249,"Excited by the many glowing reviews I sat down in my local Odeon with anticipation to watch Joker. Unfortunately it fairly quickly became clear that the Joke was on me. I feel like the little boy in the tale of the Emperor's New Clothes, the only one able to tell the truth about what I saw. Nothing but a gloomy, depressing character study with Phoenix trying and failing to hang on to the ciat tails of the incomparable Heath Ledger. Do yourself a favour and give this one a miss. If you don't it will be two hours of your life wasted that you'll never get back."
250,"First of all, sorry for my bad English.
Btw, I went to cinema on hype wave with mr. Phoenix's Joker (and, of course, Im big lover of Jokers portated by mr. Ledger and mr. Nicholson). But what I saw in this movie is unacceptable.In any cases Joker is handsome character but the cause of his actions is always in his mind (or in his insanity). But not here. Mr. Phoenix's Joker - is a victim on society and mr. Philips say to us that ALL bad actions that we saw in the past - is the result of society. But its can't be true!If its true, then society WANTS to have shootings in Orland, Carolina, Las Vegas, all this peoples (and childrens!) were kill by our hands. Thats what i saw in this movie. All the human's pain was produced by our hands, by my hands, but this is not true, mr. Philips. I dont want to had 9/11, i dont want to have WWII (and WW1 also). This is not my birthday wish. So you was wrong, mr. Philips, with idead of this movie.If i want to protest against the society - I will take some anti-drugs flyiers and give it to my friends or visit some schools to tell childrens that they have to care of their siblings and help their parents or tall with parents to teach children do rights things in their future. Thats will be my protest against society. But not making a chaos.Btw, good play, mr. Phoenix, very well done. Hope you will take Oskar for that."
251,"There is no reason for this movie to have been made. I went because of all the ecstatic reviews. Two hours of relentless blood spilling and gory murders. Giving the Joker this horrific backstory does nothing to enhance the Batman nemesis story. Joaquin Phoenix gives a silly, over-the-top performance. Robert De Nero is the only reason I gave this trash 3 stars. He enhances, but cannot save, this terrible movie."
252,"This movie rips off other movies, doesn't have any redeeming value, and even implies Bruce Wayne is the father of the Joker? What kind of joke is this? Not a DC movie, not an origins story. Just the work of some hack who stole ideas from Scorsese, and tries to make a dangerous, ill man into some kind of folk hero. Unfortunately Joaquim Phoenix just overacts in this one. And he's in literally every single scene in this movie, so it becomes very tiresome to watch. Crap."
253,"Performance of Joaquin Phoenix aside the overall movie is way too overhyped. It is way too slow and repetitive in the first half, the setbacks haven't been shown dramatic and dire enough to justify his eventual behavior. The laugh is not vicious and more importantly out of place in most sequences. Finally it is not clear how and why he was able to mobilize all the anarchists in the entire Gotham."
254,"Joaquin Phoenix does a great job with the part he was dealt - but the movie itself was very bad. Draggy, with truly shallow character development (he is mentally troubled and Gotham is a harsh environment, you dont need 2 hours to convey that properly...).Todd Phillips is clearly at a loss to convey deep ideas through film. The trip through Joker is cluttered with terrible plot devices that offer to lead the plot down an interesting path, but inevitably lead to the most predictable, uninteresting conclusion you could have predicted.Saving comparisons for last - this movie just doesnt do justice for the Joker. He is meant to be a villian, not someone who to relate to. The Heath Ledger Joker was dark, twisted, and yet there was still relatability in his madness, one could understand his motives despite their general lack of morals, however this Joker seems to just be grasping for your pity - to the very conclusion of the film where you wont be sure if the triumphant music is supposed to be ironic, or if you are really supposed to feel like Arthur Flecks story has arrived at its fated end - Im quite sure the movies creators dont know themselves."
255,"I have looked forward to this movie for a long time. A big fan of the character and the actors themselves.I was very disappointed. The acting from this movie was brilliant without fault. I would give it 10/10 if it were based on that alone.The Joker character is supposed to be an extremely high trait psychopath absent of all rationale and sanity. The Joker character portrayed in this movie is human. It is someone who shows symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. There are very few characteristics of someone that is a high trait psychopath. I have worked on psychiatric inpatient wards (including forensic) and have several degrees within the field. The Joker in this movie is a human-being that is unwell. I have done extensive research in both the fields of psychopathy and bipolar disorder. He shows symptoms of someone experiencing psychosis and very few symptoms of the dark triad (Psychopathy, Narcissism and Machiavellianism).The Joker character in the comic books and cartoons is supposed to be the most deranged killer and high trait psychopath that is INHUMANLY possible. What I saw was one of my patients suffering without help due to cuts for NHS funding, the US medical system. Adding to the stigma behind mental illness.I applaud the actors in this movie. They have represented people who experience bipolar disorder, types of schizophrenia and some personality disorder traits excellently. But this has added to the stigma of mental health difficulties. People who suffer from these conditions should not be feared.The point is..... If you ever are going to make a Joker movie again, ask for more advice from professionals.... You have added to the stigma of people who are mentally ill. Psychopathy is a trait not a disorder.Disappointed is all I can say."
256,One of the worst movies I have seen in years. Best part is Cream's White Room. Director is terrible.
257,"After seeing the billboard signs all around the London Underground and learning that the critics has approved of the film in their masses, I was very much looking forward to what appeared to be a very different and almost arthouse interpretation of the Joker.Before I tell you what I think of the film, I want to go into what I believe the Joker to be and the interpretation of him based on the comic books. Firstly as per the source material, the Joker is not actually insane but rather what one psychiatrist in the comics describes as being 'supersane'. He sees the irony in the world and the way that it works. Like the Comedian in the Alan Moore comic book 'The Watchmen' (which at one time was going to use the Joker before settling on the Comedian character), he treats the world as 'one big joke'. The Joker does not like to conform or like to follow rules and regulations. In the comic books the Joker is a failed comedian who is driven over the edge after a series of tragedies and then snaps out at the world. This is by no way saying that his actions are ever justified. On the contrary he is evil, ruthless, daring, sadistic and twisted. But not conforming to societies rules and norms makes him far more intelligent and innovative.With that said, I was somewhat dissapointed in the way that the Joker was portrayed in this new movie. Yes, Joaquin Pheonix is a great actor who deserves recognition for his performance here, though I would stop short to suggest that it is an Oscar worthy performance. But the fact that his character of Arthur Fleck is compromised from the start with both psychological issues and a laughing condition, which makes him laugh uncontrollably when he is nervous or anxious, dumbs down the origins story. One does subsequently feel pity for Arthur throughout the film from seeing him get mobbed by kids on the street, being refused psychological treatment due to funding cuts, being treated terribly by his work colleagues and boss, having to look after his elderly mother, the issue of unrequited love with his neighbour, his subsequent humiliation at the hands of Robert De Niro's character and learning about his mother's past, which leads to the bloody and brutal finale. Ultimately, Arthur's transformation to the Joker is due to the brutality and harshness of society and the way it treats those who are different. Whether this is through its lack of caring for the the sick, the elderly, the mentally challenged or even the physically disabled. The fact that he shows some sympathy to the dwarf character, also strongly suggests that this Joker is not actually evil. This is the complete antithesis of what the Joker is. Infact, I really don't see this interpretation of the Joker successfully standing off against Batman. As a result the film left me somewhat dissapointed. Part of this was also because the script was very poorly written.The redeeming part of the film is the ending, which combined with several earlier flashback scenes makes you wonder whether the events in the film even took place or were just a figment of Arthur's imagination, very similar to the ending of Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in America', which suggests that Robert De Niro's character may have dreamed up all the events of the movie. After all the joker does state in the comic book 'The Killing Joke' that if he prefers to have a past, he would rather it be multiple choice, so this is a valid hypothesis. Which leaves us to ponder whether this film should be considered as Cannon to the Batman universe or not. I myself prefer that it was not considered to be cannon and an glad that it is a standalone film.The film is inspired of numerous films throughout the decades, which includes the Kings of Comedy, Clockwork Orange, Taxi Driver, Falling Down, Only God Forgives and Drive. However, I personally don't think it has the intelligence or effectiveness of Falling Down or indeed the panache of another film that I recently saw from Indian cinema, which I would highly recommend to readers, called Wajood starring the brilliant Nana Patekar. For me the Joker could have been a better film as a standalone study of mental illness, without the Batman Franchise being associated with it."
258,This was badly overhyped on all levels. Joaquin Phoenix whom I usually enjoy did not portray the man who became the Joker very well. Robert De Niro whom I normally love as well was just a twisted version of the late Johnny Carson. Worst of all was the directing job of Todd Phillips. He should not have taken on this movie. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME
259,"any motion picture that has Laurence Sheer(the cinematographer) + Joaquin Phoenix built in a Gotham setting will be a success.the movie argues that Arthur was pushed into this ""madness"" as a result of unfair, unjust and down right cruel society that Gotham was (how cliche) - nothing fun about that. a big part of the joker character (for me at least) was the joy he took in the chaos he created and this was rushed over by the director. Nothing to celebrate any where in the movie.the dialogue was extremely poor. Complexity of the character should have been exercised in words rather than just staring into mirrors and through the glass windows.some intense scenes were unnecessary. Just because it's overwhelming doesn't earn it the right to be part of the story.not a whole lot of originality. too many scenes were copied or ""inspired"" by and from other movies: Nolan's Dark knight, Scorsese's king of comedy and Taxi Driver.and ofcourse, anything that audience can't relate to is justified by ""well, it's joker! It's not suppose to make sense""Bottom line, don't think too much of it. Not a bad movie but everyone needs to calm down or perhaps the bar is set so low now that....Oh and the ""joker laugh""....lets just say, it was also poor."
260,"I had the chance of seeing a screening of Joker at the Venice Film Festival last week. 'Joker' was easily one of the highlights of the festival thanks to Joaquin Phoenix's breathtaking performance and Todd Phillips' clever directing.Although the movie consists of an amazing supporting cast, you mostly watch the movie through Arthur's (Joker's) lenses. Arthur is present in every scene of the movie, ala taxi drive. The movie clearly draws inspiration from Scorsese's 80s work (most notably from Taxi Driver and King Of Comedy. There's a lot of nods and easter eggs for the fans of those two movies). The gotham city we see in this movie is the most corrupt version to date, which is to be expected when our beloved caped crusader doesn't exist. It's a nightmarish vision of New York where corruption, crime and chaos are the leading forces behind everything. The story takes clever twists and turns that will leave even the most hardcore and well-read DC fans with their jaws on the floor. I wish I could talk about them but I don't want to go into spoilers. As for Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the clown prince of crime, there's really not much to say that you haven't read already. Phoenix literally transforms into both the role of Arthur Fleck and the Joker, giving us a super realistic and groundbreaking performance that even the Oscars cant snob. Joker is a strong contender for best picture.This movie is a must watch for both comic book and drama fans alike. It's a deep character study of a mentally ill man slowly sinking into madness that shouldn't be overlooked by anyone.Overall, this movie gets a 10/10 from me. I cant wait to see more small budget comic book movies about other DC villains (or heroes!)."
261,"I feel like the only person who thought this movie was absolutely terrible and a complete waste of time and money.Firstly it's in no way entertaining. Every scene is an endless indulgence of people trying to be artsy but only accomplishing a boring, frustrating and pointless video of an actor being totally mental. Being completely mental is not hard to script or act, nothing needs to make sense and you don't need any element of normality - enter the joker. Acting on the spectrum is much more difficult - think Forrest Gump, I am Sam or Rain Man.So if it's not meant to be entertaining than what's the point? Just to make you uncomfortable and frustrated? Job done. But who wants to watch that? No thanks.As far as being the joker that's the most disappointing aspect of the film. The character has 0 intelligence, manipulative inclinations or ability to scheme and organise (again he's completely insane). He's also not funny. The joker from the comics is the antithesis of batman. He has no back story, he's clever and cunning and always putting things together. He runs a criminal empire and never acts alone. This joker was a loner, totally insane and gets in a fridge? Also he's far too old to be the joker, when Bruce grows up he'll be fighting an old man. So if it's not a joker origin story then what is it? A poorly scripted, weak story with an agenda to showcase an unrealistic perspective on mental illness.The story moves along at a snail's pace to make allowances for the joker to dance around looking like a fruit cake. The whole movie is uncomfortable and low resolution in its plot and motive. If this is what passes as a good movie then it's a very sad day for humanity 1/10"
262,"Arthur(Phoenix, Oscar-worthy yet again) is a clown for hire. He wants to cheer up the world. And to experience human connection. For someone to notice him without becoming verbally, frequently even physically, abusive. To be treated like a person. He struggles with mental illness. Both finding successful treatment, and for others to stop responding so negatively to his diagnosis. And while he feels perpetually lonely, he's not the only one to realize how bad things are getting, and how little those with money and influence do to help anyone but themselves.This is deeply messed up. It makes your mind go places you never thought it would. Including, maybe especially, when funny. In other words, it nails the core, managing to also put a fresh coat of paint on an icon with nearly 80 years of history. This explores how little sympathy and empathy(the lead only loses the audience's once he becomes a monster) is shown towards the least powerful people in society. However, it's not exclusively(albeit chiefly) about those with psychological issues. It also goes into poverty. How little those that could easily address these things even try to properly comprehend the problems. I'm not saying there's a solution that would not require time, political will and accountability for those who use their clout to try to fight these efforts. What I am saying is that we need those I'm talking about to join in the process.Taxi Driver very clearly shaped a lot of this, to incredible effect, and this film is as amazing as that one. This is the first live-action version(at least in the last 30+ years, I will grant that I am not very familiar with the takes that go back further than that) where you can understand how the Joker ends up with his signature look in a realistic world. A vigilante using martial arts and gadgets would have felt hugely out of place in this, so I'm thrilled nothing like that appears(Bruce is a child here), and I hope that this remains standalone, rather than Joaquin facing off against Batman. Keeping in mind that I love The Dark Knight trilogy.I rarely give anything the highest possible score. To me, it means that while the movie isn't perfect(that is a status that should be strived for: it can never truly be reached), there is no weakness within it that is not greatly outweighed by its positives. That's not even a contest when it comes to this. I can't put into words how grateful I am to everyone who worked on this for being able to say that about it.There is some bloody violence in this, a little of it immensely brutal. I recommend this to everyone who is passionate about the titular character. 10/10"
263,I realy dont know those Masterpiece reviews its a realy boring movie whit nothing special a about it. Heath ledger its not realy happy in the grave about this movie
264,"A confused representation of insanity from a perspective of a sane person, a celebration of madness and chaos.
At last, I have watched one of the most anticipated movies of this year.
I experienced sadness, creepiness, joy, rage, confusion altogether, and it felt good.
The story was above average, sometimes the director seemed confused about what he's trying to say.
There were so many beautiful distinct pieces scattered throughout the film that gives you chills but ultimately they failed to form a complete landscape, eventually it became a gorgeously crafted baroque film with a sheer hollow inside.
It criticizes our self-centered, pretentious, empathy less society but ironically the movie itself falls under its own sword.Welcome, Tod Phillips to the big boy's club! His direction was crafty and pretty awesome though lack a little bit of originality. His trick with Arthur's illusion seemed a bit risky given its context. We will never know for sure if Arthur did go Murray's show or not!The cinematography was superb, there were plenty of scenes that'll enter your mind and stay there for a while.Joaquin Phoenix did his best, tried hard to embody the magnanimous character of Joker, he did pretty well, but sometimes it felt he was just trying too hard. Despite it's unfair to compare him with great heath ledger I must say he was able to pull it off impressively and takes this Joker to a distinct level. It was a one-man show and he's gonna get nominated for the academy award for sure.One of the most entertaining and satisfying aspects of this film is its music composition, damn! It was too good, and you'll get to see some insane dance move as a bonus.
The main problem with this film is the lack of originality and a precise plot, sometimes it felt like the movie itself was confused and wandering aimlessly! That's why it failed to become a complete cinematic art rather than a montage of eye pleasing scenes, and nothing more.Overall, despite its shortcomings, this movie is definitely one of the most exciting movie of this year.My Rating:7.5/10"
265,"Worst movie I've ever seen in my life, the only good part was when Joker shot RobertDinero in the face.
Unless you really really overboard into performing arts (not including acting, because they all sucked)
The only actor that was good in the entire movie was the social worker and the Arkham records administrator😃😄😂🤣🤣 🤡👺"
266,"OK, I'll agree that Joaquin Phoenix did a great job acting the part. However, I really don't get how people think this is a masterpiece. it was slow, too long, boring, and depressing. I get they were trying to show how the joker was missed treated, had a horrible life, and he finally cracked, but they could've sped that part up and did more of him acting out. That would've been more entertaining, I wish I could go back in time and unsee this movie. What a waste of time."
267,"I gave 3 stars only because of the spectacular acting, the writing and story get a 0 from me as it doesn't follow any of the hints of joker's origin from other films and shows, so I was displeased to find they made and entire new storyline. I was also annoyed that the Wayne's deaths were included in a new situation as well, almost as if Joker indirectly created batman. Simply I was unhappy with the story they put on the bug screen having been a DC fan my whole life."
268,"Not sure why so much hype about an ever so boring movie. Over implying the obvious is what is going on in this nonsense called Joker. Moves at a snails pace and ultimately one loses all empathy towards the main character. The whole boring drama tries to drive in the fact that the Joker is lunatic and it just never moves on. Joaquin is wasted in this over dramatic saga. Each to their own, some people love it coz they cud probably relate to it, but I hated it."
269,"It's funny to see so many 10's, this Joker is not the Batman's Joker, but someone who inspired the criminal who will become the Batman's Joker.
This movie is more a drama and a portrait of today's society than a Super Heroes (Villain) movie... so, don't expect action.
The performance is good, but not superb. I think the movie is very overrated."
270,"Just to say that the film left me wanting to watch ""The King of Comedy"" and ""Taxi Driver"" the whole time, plus a few of the other films that this film strongly references. Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic however and the film has all the top production values that you'd expect of a big studio picture but it's generic and predicable in my opinion. It takes from so much that it's not it's own film for me. By no means is the film awful, it's just soulless. I'm not trying to be deliberately obtuse and against the tide of support for this film either, there are things as I've mentioned to commend and I'd like to add that going the way of gritty R rated film making is what I've wanted for years, from a more dramatic viewpoint, I thought ""Logan"" did what this film failed to do for me as a darker comic book oriented film. I hope people can respect my opinion just as I respect the free speech of everyone who really liked the film. Finally, I will add that those who have bashed the film for violence do not know what they're talking about. There are far more violent films than this and if one person or even a handful of people were incentivised to cause harm to others, the rest of us shouldn't have to pay for the odd few thank you very much. It's an interesting watch for certain and I'd recommend watching for that reason alone."
271,"I watched joker film at the cinema. The film was awful and unexciting. Although the film is absolutely awful, the followers are increasing to watch it. I wouldn't recommend it because that gave me a bad message that the society is a negative effect on behaviour's human, For example: If someone past negative experiences, they will kill each person them abuse, that whether verbal or physical abuse."
272,"Joaquin Phoenix's performance is excellent, but the film is flawed, the main offenders being a second act twist that's visible a mile away and a small scene during the ending that feels tacked on.However, you should see this film at least once."
273,The depth of the story was lacking to much focus on such a short aspect of the jokers life and he became the joker there was not much of a journey. The constant musical score was over dramatic and did not add much to the film if anything it detracted from the movie. All the actors performed excellently but this is not a movie to be entertained by our top be taken in by all the characters as the focus is so much on one person without a real journey.This is my opinion as my partner really thought it was a good movie. In the end I could not wait for it to be finished I think the character of joker has been devoured from the comics and previous movies.
274,"This is ""Joker"", a 2019 movie and the title is really telling what/who it is about. But first things first: The director is Todd Phillips and he is also one of several writers working on the screenplay for this 2-hour movie. Phillips is still mostly known for his Hangover films probably and in general for his collaborations with Zach Galifianakis. So gently-speaking, the filmmaker's career is not exactly filled with projects that were received greatly by critics. This one here is no exception either. General movie-goers apparently really loved it, but critics not so much. A bit like Bohemian Rhapsody not too long ago. That one I really adored though, this one here not so much. Still I am a big Joaquin Phoenix fan and as such, it is impossible to give the film a thumbs-down overall. He is the movie. And I am really glad he plays the title character because otherwise I maybe would not have liked it at all. Not just because of personal preference, but also because Phoenix really is that good from beginning to end and he is in almost every scene. Not too long ago, Jared Leto played the Joker (Batman's nemesis) and there was a lot of hype surrounding his turn that quickly vanished because he really did not have too much screen time at all and stayed pale in comparison to Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn. But lets not drift away from this film here now. For Phoenix, all the hype is justified and well-deserved. I think he is still up there and a potential contender for the Oscar win this year with his nomination pretty much a safe deal and I read that it could be between him and Adam Driver and I like both for being slightly oddball, so I certainly approve. Of course with stuff like Her, The Master and my personal favorite Walk the Line under his belt, it is arguable if this one here should be the movie for which he gets a golden statuette, but I still hope he does. If we consider Daniel Day-Lewis retired now, he is probably the best actor working right now and as he is still under 50, that is quite impressive. At least in my opinion, but he is just so consistent and constantly adds depth to his characters in a way where you feel nobody else could have done it this well. He does so much with his eyes. Okay you get the message, I thought he was an amazing Joker.Sadly I cannot say the same about the film itself really. There are good moments here and there, no denying at all, but I was still not satisfied with the script I must say. It felt to me that, most of all, they were taking the safe route basically and going the way where it would obviously be a crowd pleaser, but somehow I must say that the film felt zero daring to me. Even the interactions with the Wayne family that could easily really have been goosebump material, felt a bit shoddy and for the sake of it all. I did like, however, that the way things seemed to turn out we thought it would definitely be the Joker who kills Bruce's father in the end because of the personal connection, but it was just one of his ""army"" eventually and it does not matter who did it. Joker is not really getting his hands dirty at that point anymore, he has others who do so for him. Also pay attention to how everybody who means something to him early on (his mother, De Niro's character most of all) are killed by him. I must say I did wonder though how they did not try to catch him after he strangles his mother. I mean as for the colleague at his apartment, it made more sense because the time between that and the show appearance was perhaps too short. But still the cops were following him and that was accurate. There, however, Clownmania was already going on in full force you could say. Big enough though for police not to go to the studio and arrest him right away? I would say I disagree. In general, this is a film where you can never really be sure how much of it is real and how much just happens in the protagonist's head. Like his relationship with the neighbor, but that is just the obvious one where we know it is fake, even if I did not see it coming. Of course also the relationship between his mother and Mr. Wayne (okay that seemed fairly far-fetched from the beginning, I mean Joker cannot be Batman's half-brother can he?) or the medical condition he has in terms of laughing or the idea about De Niro's character early on almost acting like a father figure to him in front of the camera, which most likely was fake too because there were no references later on that it was not his first time on the show. So this is a film that will certainly play with your head continuously because the only moments you can be 100% sure they are real and actually happening are those that include a great deal of violence, such as the killing of the three young men on the subway. Or the talk show host murder. Or the killing of his mother? Or maybe is that fake too? I mean it is a big step, even if she did invent the relationship with Bruce's dad. He really really cares for her. And he won't kill the colleague who always treated him well. I thought it was a psycho trick that he left the door closed and tthe guy is too small to reach the knob/key, but no he really just forgot it and lets him go eventually. He is a psychopath yes, but with his very own unpredictable style. Of course, there are aside from that these moments with all the over-the-top laughing, most notably when he visits the comedy show and laughs each and every time everybody else stays quiet and stays quiet himself when they are laughing at the punch lines. Now that was kinda hilarious because of how awkward it felt and also very telling because we saw how he totally did not fit in with everybody else, the average people.Okay, I think this would be pretty much all then. I mentioned some of the scenes that stayed most memorable to me. Maybe, most likely, you have different scenes that fit the description for you and that is perfectly fine because there are so many to pick from. There is hardly one that is really weak and I think the running time was accurate too and I don't say that too often about 2-hour movies that they should not have kept it a bit shorter on some occasions, so you can see it as a compliment. But like I mentioned previously already, those scenes that did stand out mostly did so because of Phoenix giving it his best and not really because of great writing. I think the dialogue writing was still a bit better than the writing of the action and what the characters were doing compared to saying, which sometimes made me forgot about the relatively weak ways in which the story was progressing. This also applies especially to the idea of everybody getting more and more crazy out there somehow. There is a fairly memorable quote from Fleck (Joker in his ""human form"") about that that they really could have made a lot with (also they included it in the trailer) story-wise, but the way they included the clown army for example felt really out of nowhere and it did not make too much sense to me. Okay we get it. Gotham is not at a good place to be right now, but with such a movement you just have to come up with a better explanation and elaboration and lead us there more convincingly. Okay that would be all then I liked and disliked about this film. It certainly won't make it into my top10 movies of the year and if it gets in at the Oscars for Best Picture, that is too much I think, but I wish Phoenix all the luck he can have for upcoming awards season because his turn here can really be described as greatness. There was always a lot of arguing about who's the best Joker. Nicholson? Ledger? Hamill? Romero? There is definitely a new name that can be added to the discussion now. All in all, the film gets a thumbs-up from me."
275,"This film surpassed all other films in portraying the slow descent into madness, caused by biological, psychological, social and familial factors.
It also highlighted the decaying n broken system n society's austerity.
The film is very dark, it has amazing cinematography n this year's best performance by Phoenix.
It has a very surrealistic feel n in fact a solid non horror film which is terrifying n poignant."
276,"I found nothing interesting or artistic about this movie, it's just a meaningless show which pretends something meaningful"
277,"Masterpiece of TrashMy brain cannot possibly comprehend the pile of human fecal matter that is the Joker or the reality that I wasted two hours of my life on such a lame excuse for a film. If you are raving that Joker is a great film, then it is clear you have the intellect of a piece of lint. If you were one that propagated that Joker was ultra-violent, then it's clear you watched a different film because there is only one violent scene in the entire film that lasted a few seconds.The movie ""Joker"" is a pathetic waste of time. 55% of the movie is Joaquin Phoenix laughing or dancing awkwardly. The other 45% is spent attempting to create the Joker origin, but is really just political trash.The Joker is the hero - the poor and mentally ill, yet violently murdering sociopath is the hero of this film. Batman is evil as were his parents. The Wayne's deserved to die because according to this film they were rich, so they should be demonized and killed. That's a clear point because in this movie all rich people should die.There is no actual plot. No actual point. No deep meaning. ""Joker"" attempts an origin, while making a political stage to demonize ""rich"" people. Joker is clearly a political film written and produced to promote sociopathic violence against anyone that works or earns their living. Rich people beware. Question is though is this message directed also at the rich folks that wrote, produced, directed, or acted in this movie? Nope.I also found the film dishonest intellectually in the understanding of mental disorders. It's offensive towards the mentally ill. A few questions: How is a woman that's been diagnosed as delusional and a sociopath qualify to adopt a child? Why would a mentally ill person, that is on a city assisted program, not have any other options if that social facility shut down? Why is severe mental illness and sociopathy applauded in this film as heroic traits?The only part of this movie I enjoyed was when the nut-job & violent propagating talk show host got shot. Best part. The rest is garbage. Don't waste your time."
278,"But the 10 star reviews that came flooding in were too much for me to take seriously, and I was right.By all means, go see Joker - it's a standalone origin story that needs no knowledge of the Batman series, but it also rewards fans of that series with some very convincing details and very believable storytelling.I won't get into the plot, but there are some twists. Very well done, in fact, even though they are both reminiscent of certain M. Knight Shymalan films. Very tastefully done and expertly integrated into the storyline without overindulgence and quite important for the story and character arcs at play. Bravo in that respect.Also, applause for the cinematography, the style, the homages to previous classics and just the wonderfully realistic atmosphere that the director and his crew were able to bring to life here. Positively the most believable and realistic Gotham ever. Some might find that to be a veiled critique, but it makes this film watchable and enjoyable by those who have no knowledge of the Batman franchise(s).Just altogether airtight production and direction. Hands down.The only gripe I have is with the score - not the songs, necessarily, but the use of over-dramatic violin/cello passages and too-loud unnecessary (and very dark) orchestral pieces that almost take the audience out of the experience. Those who have seen it may know what I am talking about, but no spoilers.All in all, this is very much worth watching even if I feel as though it may spawn some copycats in real life - sure to have a long ""cult film"" life after it fades from the cinemas.7.5/10 with no caveats."
279,"Phoneix is so complete in his portrayal of a man's irrevocable decline into insanity that Joker and Batman story line becomes merely incidental to entire narrative. Phoenix steals the show in every scene he's in and he's in every scene. He manages to create that balance between insanity (which Leto overshot) and philosophy (Which Heath Ledger nailed) whilst also giving his character a really retro vibe.The gritty and grimy hyper-realism of Gotham subverts the comic genre and makes it a movie focused on telling it's own story. If I had to compare Joker to any other movie probably it will be Taxi Driver or One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But, honestly speaking, the added layer of the Joker's nihilism and the complete lack of actual superheroes add a whole other level. In all honesty It is a cinematic experience that generates a lot of empathy and provokes a lot of thought."
280,"Such a waste of time and money. Boring as hell..!!
If it would be possible I would give it -10!!!
Overrated....!!!!
I guess all because of paid reviews."
281,"Actually, the hype was sooooooo big that I was sure it will blow my mind.But it was mehhh.Really, truly mehhh.I swear god it was just mehhh.What is wrong with you people? It doesn't even come closer to Ledger's masterpiece.Is everybody blind or something? If I drank every single time he faked that irritating laugh, I would end up in the hospital of alcohol poisoning what the...... man ????"
282,"Joker was epic. It's a fantastic character study centred around the most popular comic book villain of all-time but crafts a story that makes this incarnation of the character stand on its own. It's a beautifully crafted piece with stunning cinematography and art direction. I'm a fan of this changed appearance of the Joker. And Todd Phillips does a fantastic job in the director and writer's chair. Phillips' tackling of certain political and social issues will spark conversations in groups full of people smarter than myself, but I understood the messages that were coming across. But Joaquin Phoenix is one of the biggest draws of the film with such a praiseworthy performance. I don't really care for the Oscars and award shows anymore, but Phoenix deserves the accolades coming his way for such a masterful and haunting performance.One thing that I must point out, is that it's unfair to compare Phoenix to Heath Ledger's performance in The Dark Knight. They may play the character with the same name, but these are two drastically different portrayals in both performance and script and it's unjust to compare. Just worship the fact that we were given two immense performances from two different actors."
283,The best movie of this year. The best Joker I have ever seen. Very realistic
284,"Such a different kind of film it's hard to describe, but I'll try. Dark, twisted, humanly relatable, psychotic realism from the point of view of an impoverished society letting its citizens fall through the gaps. It's the perfect combination of uncomfortable, awkward, sad, and funny. I'm pretty sure I felt new untapped emotions without current names, like discovering a new species of animal. It's a work or art, not a super hero of anti-hero movie. Many will be disappointing, as a little of me was, but most of me was very very satisfied. Don't walk there with any expectations, just an open pallet and soak up the paint as it's brushed."
285,"These reviews claiming this movie to be a ""masterpiece"" etc etc, are absolutely ridiculous. You know the story before you walk in. Much of what happens you predict well in advance. Rather than entertain the audience, it relies on you being fascinated by the antics of a psychotic nutcase whilst trying to convince you that he is somehow heroic."
286,"This movie is a shallow look at mental disorders, and somehow is 2 hours but moves in no direction and drops you back to the beginning. Do not waste your money, go see Hustlers."
287,"""Joker"" is highly derivative and a poor imitation of better Scorsese movies. The movie didn't really know what it was trying to say. On top of that it's very cynical and will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. Great performance from Joaquin Phoenix but it's not essential viewing."
288,"This is one of the most overrated movies ever. Once again, Joaquin Phoenix's creepy weirdness totally overshadows everything else in this film. He's so desperate to make this his own character, that he makes the whole film awkwardly uncomfortable and unenjoyable to watch. I'm not sure what character he was supposed to be, but it sure wasn't the joker. He was just a creepy guy in a clown costume with extensive psychological issues. Skip this garbage."
289,"Crazy good performance by Phoenix, the tv show scene at the end is total immersion rarely seen. Cinematography and soundtrack is also stellar.The story on the other hand is really weak. Phillips decided - instead of actually say something real and of value that embarks discussions - to write a story about nothing as it's filled with red herrings across the board and an open ending. As we don't know what happened or not, about anything, everything is also without meaning. We can only guess.It's just lazy writing to let the viewer guess what ever the happened or not."
290,"I was so hype after the trailer, and kinda expecting to be disappointed because DC you khow... but well it turn out even better than what the trailer had shown, and im grad its.
The acting in this movie is too good, hat off to the new joker Joaquin Phoenix. He deserved an oscar for this act.
The story line is still kinda classic joker's but its darker and a lot more twist, i cant count how many time i almost jump off my sit by suprise and excitement.
And there is sooo many dark joke... i love it."
291,"Not worth a comment, total crap and not worthy of the review"
292,Do not lead to torturing children (mother) nor murdering people.
293,"I don't get it. I think it's a case of ""everyone thinks this is great so I should too"". I was definitely not impressed."
294,"Brilliant acting for this film, found myself I was waiting for something to happen, get the message about mental health and how bad the system is, but something missing for me"
295,"I feel like I am missing something with this film. Having heard so many plaudits I was looking forward to finally seeing it but I just feel empty after viewing it.The film touched on so many current issues but explored none in any detail. Mental health, bullying, abuse, class, anarchy but it was all barely touching the surface. Meanwhile Arthur's character I felt didn't really change much. He just went from troubled and weak to troubled but armed with a gun - so he could suddenly fight back... there was no moment of realisation when he somehow decided to be proactive or take control.That really seemed to be the character development done. We saw nothing at all of the making of a mastermind criminal. Nothing preplanned. No learning curve. No real agency in what was happening.Parts I liked, or thought well done. For example it was bleak and depressing presumably as intended, so in a way it was atmospheric - it was in that way a believable world except that every now and then something unlikely would occur (stealing a advertising board - why? Police not following up investigations, tv clips, lack of security in a dangerous world). The end result was it ceased to feel real even as the direction went for gritty.The other problem was the tropes, his (obvious) imaginary girlfriend, whose presence real or imagined made zero difference to the plot. Then the ambiguous ending - the film was already lacking in depth so the idea that what I had seen might have been imagined just makes it seem even less worthwhile.Finally the acting was in my opinion just okay. We expect the joker to have idiosyncrasies and we saw that with Phoenix's portrayal but I did not see the transition or subtlety I'd hoped for. The empathy or sympathy desired by the director for the joker was not through the acting but rather through events we know to feel sad for others about. Frankly the Lego Batman movie did a better job of exploring the motivation of the joker character and creating some ambiguity of feeling."
296,It was so bad. All he did was killing people
297,"I was boring in cinema, just good marketing and promotion"
298,"Leading up to the films release it had high expectations and if im honest i was quite disappointed with the film, i felt like the storyline was pretty good and the acting although the long and boring execution of it is what killed it for me"
299,"Joker is one of a kind comic book movie. Packed with top notch cinematography and Phoenix's career best acting, this movie is the best to come out in years."
300,"I'm shocked bad movie overrated realiy you guys follow media this isn't good things juat go and watch the real joker (the dark knight ) then came and rate this , and i have no more words but i must file it i have no more words but i must file it"
301,Felt like a 2 hour trailer waiting for the joker while a bozo smoked cigs and walked around doing fk all. Finally the last 5 minutes came and i thought wow we have a movie then it ended. Id rather spend my 20 on some face paint and some pints and actually enjoy my life. This will go down as one of the days where the long awaited hype was flushed down the toilet. Thank you for that.
302,"Featuring a riveting, fully realized, and Oscar-worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix, Joker would work just as well as an engrossing character study without any of its DC Comics trappings; that it just so happens to be a brilliant Batman-universe movie is icing on the Batfan cake. You will likely leave Joker feeling like I did: unsettled and ready to debate the film for years to come.
Clearly drawing its spirit and style from classic '70s and '80s films like Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy, A Clockwork Orange, and Dog Day Afternoon, director Todd Phillips' Joker presents a Gotham City that is unmistakably a stand-in for the hellish New York City of the era. It was a time when rampant crime, corruption, economic crises, and social ills saw it dubbed ""Fear City.""This Gotham is a place of grimy despair, extreme wealth disparity, and festering lawlessness, teetering on the brink of collapse. While this realistic depiction makes a place that's typically fantastical seem familiar, it's not just the recognizable setting that gives Joker its hyper-realism; it's what it's allegorically about that makes the movie so believable, timely, and worth talking about long after the credits roll. Joker is a period piece but it is undeniably about our own troubled, relentlessly violent time.Joker's setting (roughly 1981) not only allows the film to be a comic book version of classic Martin Scorsese or Sidney Lumet films, it also strips away the technology that nowadays would help catch such a madman sooner rather than later. This is a time when people smoked everywhere (including hospitals), security cameras and metal detectors weren't ubiquitous, and no one wore seat belts while driving. Times were bad but they could get even worse. Joker the character acts as the symbolic match to that waiting dynamite.Unnervingly played by Joaquin Phoenix, the mentally ill Arthur Fleck is a struggling, overlooked schlepp trapped on the margins of society. Arthur is a man who has never had a good break or happy day in his life. The less said about how and why Arthur embraces the Joker persona and finds his liberation and joyful empowerment the better - this is a film meant to be experienced with an open mind and sans spoilers - but suffice it to say this Joker is the end result of a society far too comfortable with its casual cruelties and lack of empathy. We create the monsters we deserve.Joker is an indictment of a society's collective disregard for the well-being of its citizens rather than necessarily critiquing any one type of individual or class. As much as you sympathize with their plight, Gotham's downtrodden can be as callous and vicious as the rich and powerful. Arthur is at one point or another injured emotionally or physically by individuals at every level, as well as by the institutions they populate. If Taxi Driver's Travis Bickle called himself ""God's lonely man"" then Arthur Fleck is certainly Gotham's lonely man. Arthur is ultimately seeking human connection, something he tragically won't find until he puts on a happy face and violently exposes the city's own hypocrisies and inhumanity.Joker the film may ask viewers to empathize with its central protagonist but it doesn't ask us to forgive him for his increasingly evil choices. As many real-world parallels and inspirations can be uncomfortably drawn from Arthur's descent into violent madness, the film still knows he's deranged and not to be romanticized - merely understood.
The Many Origin Stories of the JokerThe key to that careful calibration is not only Todd Phillips' sharp direction and clear vision but also Joaquin Phoenix's indelible performance. Arthur's uncontrollable laughter looks as though it physically pains him; his body is rail-thin and battered, his misery is etched on his deeply creased face. He looks healthier and livelier -- dare I say happier -- as he transforms into Joker than he ever does as Arthur. Phoenix captures all these tiny nuances in Arthur and his interactions with others that reveal so much about this disturbed individual's inner life.The camerawork is often claustrophobically tight on Phoenix, who's in nearly every scene, all of which adds to the film never making me feel like I was anywhere but in Arthur's tortured headspace. As solid as Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz and Frances Conroy are in their small roles here, this is Phoenix's film and he delivers a tour de force.Considering the comic book Joker infamously once said he preferred his origin to be multiple choice, this movie wisely embraces the ambiguity of its title character, despite this seemingly being an origin story. Arthur's increasingly unstable mental state is reflected in the film as things grow progressively more dreamlike -- okay, nightmarish -- and violent in the homestretch.Phillips (along with co-screenwriter Scott Silver) designed a film that demands multiple viewings; one of Joker's strengths is that anyone will be able to argue their side about what was real and what was imagined, and no one will be able to say another's read of it is inaccurate. For a movie about one of fiction's most unreliable narrators, we should expect nothing less.VerdictJoker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways."
303,"How is this Joker suppost to stand a chance against Batman? I thought what made joker such a great villain was his intelligence, his manipulative ability and his ability to see the inner fears of his rivals. How far will he get by only being crazy and unpredictable? Juaquin could problably get pretty far (all the way to the Oscars stage), while Joker can't even enter through a door."
304,"The acting, the scenography, the soundtracks, the storyline, the development of the character, EVERYTHING in this movie is perfect.
I sincerely consider this the best movie ever made (and I know this is a huge thing to say, but I considered all of my top 10).Thanks for creating this masterpiece."
305,"The acting,the story,the music, and the cinematography it was all awesome it was perfect looking forward to seeing this movie again with friends and family🤡🤡🤡"
306,"There is a LOT of hype around this film, and a lot of people seem to think it's great, and whilst I agree Joaquin's performance is brilliant, I was bored stiff for most of this. The kind of film I'd turn off if it was on tv. I may have been harsh on the stars but I go to the cinema to be entertained and I was far from it. If I want art I'll go to a gallery."
307,"Throw a bunch of money at a great cinematographer and a great actor, then throw in some gratuitous senseless murder in a comic book universe and watch the fanboys drool. ""It's like Scorsese!"" Yes it's derivative, except made by the dudes who brought you Road Trip and Hangover 3. Clichés galore and hardly any suspenseful scene building. It's crap, don't fall for it."
308,"Evidently this movie tapped into something with a lot of people. But I'll say I just don't see it. To me, a fan of the most iconic DC villain in history, it was a hideous representation. And don't get me started on the insulting depiction of mental illness. We have enough people thinking we (those of us with mental health issues) will randomly turn violent without a 2 hour snooze fest that plays directly to that trope.No, my big issue is the fact that the Joker wasn't funny. They've had some serious story lines, but even then the Joker made pun, and gloried in the despair and chaos of it all. He was, at his heart, an absurdist. He was evil, not crazy. And it's been hinted more than once that he was just an every day guy. One bad day and all that.I wanted to like this movie. But this angst ridden despair fest means this Joker is just... Sad. Not manic chaos and evil intelligence. This Joker fell into villainy with a lot of stupid mistakes, he couldn't even trick the cops, but he's Bruce's intellectual equal?And the AGE DIFFERENCE? What? When did Joker become an old man compared to Batman? Because by the time Bruce grows up and becomes Batman, Joker is gonna be 50-60 years old. C'mon. Also, Alfred makes an appearance and he's in his prime but he can't push off a skinny, under fed Fleck? I know it's an unreliable narrator but it's still annoying to watch.Point is, there is so much comic fodder to take from, why did they remake Taxi Driver?"
309,I have nothing to say negative about this film. This movie shows the perfection in all aspects. leading actor done fabulous job. He will never disappoint U. Role of joker perfectly acted..
310,AMAZING 😍 GENIUS!! A REAL MOVIE. WILL WATCH OVER AND OVER AGAIN
311,"I dont know what is wrong with people. There are hundreds of thousands of shows and movies out there. I recognize good acting and respect it, but i want to watch a movie or show that engages me and captivates me. This movie did neither and turned it off after 30 minutes. What a shame."
312,Well acted but entirely missed what the joker is. I was bored and found it lacking in anything of value. I have worked in mental health for many years and found this to be a poor choice of paths to take someone down. I found little empathy and even less point to this film. Joaquin Phoenix was brilliantly my score in no way reflects his acting he was simply awesome. If you liked Heath Ledger's portrayal then you will probably also enjoy this movie. This by itself and aside from the DC universe was a pretty good movie as a joker movie it was boring. I almost never give 1 star reviews but this one I could have not watched and been much happier.
313,"Just watched the movie, and I had to make an account just to put it out there, after hearing tons and tons of praises, that this movie has failed terribly in living up to the hype! I know that my opinion is extremely unpopular, but someone needs to say it. Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant as the joker, in regards to his acting, but that is probably the only positive thing about this movie. And I believe that a movie needs much more than just good acting. This movie does not even have a proper climate, and is basically about a mental illness, where I feel there is no hint of the charismatic, sick and brilliant joker we got to see in the batman series!"
314,"This movie will earn Oscar best Actor.
My concern is this movie makes you feel sorrow for the criminals.:)"
315,It doesn't follow story at all and casting was terrible Joker would be 80 or dead before he even fights Batman and he looks like some crazy clown.
316,"I really don't understand all the hype over this movie. I found it to be really boring.. and by the end of this boring, very predictable movie, I felt as though I just wasted my time and money.The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because the acting was good."
317,This was amazing. DC needs to stick with the serious and more realistic stuff. I haven't seen a DC movie this good since the Nolan Dark Knight films. This was a surprising place to find a realistic take on mental health issues and I was not expecting to ever feel bad for the Joker. The fact that some of the media doesn't get this movie is kinda ironic isn't it? It's almost like they want something negative to occur so they can blame it on the movie instead of looking in the mirror.
318,"Out of this whole year I have never watched a movie that played with my emotions quite like this film. Joker is a character study on one of the most famous villains in the dc comics but this film is not what you expect. It's more of a story of a man who has a mental illness and just keeps going to the more extreme side of insanity. This movie does that so well and Joaquin Phoenix has one of the best performances of this year and deserves on Oscar. Robert De Niro, though having a small role, has an amazing performance as well. The story is very much inspired from taxi driver but is very different as well. This is a much watch movie for any person comic fan or not. MUST WATCH AMAZING MOVIE!!!!"
319,Best story in the year .. The joker will win the best film in the year ..
320,This movie is getting a lot of praise and this film deserves IMO its better than Endgame and The Dark Knight!!!
321,Phoenix is a best joker ever he deserved oscarThis is a best movie of this year
322,"Characters that suffer abuse can be a good element in a plot. But audience should never suffer abuse. The audience needs to experience catharsis in the end. And this never happens with 'Joker'. The film has a huge problem, which it never manages to solve: it wants to be realistic and tell the tale of an innocent, abused individual who snaps; but it also wants to exist within a fictional universe in which this man is as much of an abuser as he is a victim. And this creates problems for the screenwriters that they never manage to solve. Thus Joker comes across as a sympathetic character first, but turns to a vicious killer towards the end, at which point everyone becomes confused, and stops liking him. There is no redemption of any kind, no satisfying emotional resolution, only a brutal ending which serves the purposes of the wider franchise and doesn't deliver on its own terms. In the end, the character we were made to empathize with becomes nothing but a caricature in a silly superhero universe. And that is an insult to anyone who invested in the character from the beginning. The audience is cheated. Also, one should note the disturbing anarchist/communist vibe in the film - the idea that it's better to burn down the world than allow their particular understanding of 'injustice' to go on. I may pity Joker and hate the cynical Wayne, but I won't put degenerate, mentally ill clown in charge of an angry mob that wants to burn everything down."
323,"It was a mastery in film making..from Joaquins performance to Todd Phillip's Visionary.From A Darker Rendition Of Gotham All the way to how Todd's message regarding 'mental illness' is portrayed & consistently not accepted in an awful Society.
This is how you create a character marvel!👏"
324,"Cinematography, costume design and one powerhouse performance do not a good movie make. In truth, Joker is poorly paced with a lackluster story that Frankenstiens together elements from The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver. It borrows so liberally I'm amazed it didn't get hit with a plagiarism lawsuit.Additionally, the movie has the subtlety of a sledgehammer. It's sociological commentary is ham-fisted and bland, and it lacks any truly jaw-dropping moments. Outside of the Talk Show scene and a single shot near the end, it's all very forgettable.And the song for the stair dance sequence was so colossally stupid it completely pulled me out of the film.That being said, Joaquin was great and the aforementioned cinematography and costume design were very solid. All in all, the movie coasts on Phoenix's mesmerizing portrayal, but never goes far enough to really get under your skin. Biggest letdown of the year."
325,"This movie or Shawshank Redemption takes the number 1 spot of my favorite movies. Seen it in thereaters twice. Masterpiece, well done Joaquin Phoenix, supreme acting. He must get an Oscar for this!I cannot wait for Joker 2.10/10"
326,"Possibly the worst thing I've ever seen , everybody else in the cinema thought that too"
327,"Masterpiece? Are you Jokering me? Mediocre at best.
The only explanation I can come up with to explain the gushing praise of this boring film is the dumbing down of a generation by the education system and PC culture. People seem to think its some kind of brilliant social commentary.
I usually like Joaquin Phoenix, but here he plays a bland character who comes across as very dull and of low intelligence. His laugh is grating and very un-Joker like, his dialogue is stilted and uncomfortable. There is no wit, no clever dark comedy, just seriousness and depression. The Joker has always been portayed as crazy and mentally unbalanced, but never dim-witted, until now. I don't know why this character is even called the Joker. Other than having the name Arthur Fleck he seems to be an entirely different character. Its a depressing film, which is not a bad thing in and of itself, but in this case it is. Thankfully I didn't pay any money to see this one. I'm giving it one star to even out the ridiculously high rating its got. Otherwise I'd probably give it a 4"
328,So much bad
329,A political incorrect movie but it real happen everywhere and everyday! The best movie this year.
330,The movie was to slow and had a lot of dead ends. He was crazy because his mom was crazy and he was abused as a child. There was no real point to the story. Maybe it's good if you haven't been around people with mental health problems but if you have then you probably won't like it
331,"What a horrible movie, from minute 1 you knew what's going to happen at the end. Overacting job of Phoenix. Poor acting by rest of actors."
332,"Joaquin Phoenix is amazing and in Joker you get to see his real acting material, he's amazing he's great he doesn't hesitate to give it his best and more. Joker movie is the best 2019 movie so far and probably in most recent years, from directing to the writing to the acting to the score, we were mesmerized the whole time, i give it 100 over 10, an American classic that will be talked about for many years."
333,Very different from all the past interpretations of the character
334,"Good acting but the most boring film I've seen in a long time. I was expecting a slow burner but Jesus Christ, the good scenes in no way over shined the rest of the film and when he finally became the joker he played him like a camp 3 year old, complete pretentious American garbage. Ruined the character for me, hope they never do a sequel."
335,I don't get why this movie is so popular I had to stop watching after 30 minutes of him laughing and dancing every 5 minutes. I started hoping Batman would show up just so he would punch him in the throat and put him in a wheelchair.
336,Joaquin nailed the joker character. Who would act so well without becoming one? The transformation is remarkable and leaves an image in me. Could not get the beat off from me.
337,"I couldn't find a negative thing about this movie.
It's bold and brilliant. Joaquin Phoenix gives one of the best performances I have ever seen.
You have to go and see this. The only reason it has negative reviews is because some people were expecting another superhero movie with action - thank god it's not."
338,"This movie shows the true origin of the joker that has never seen before in cinema. I went in expecting non-stop action. But I was wrong, it is more subtle and takes important aspects from the source material. JP's acting is incredible and the trans-formation from Arthur to the Joker is portrayed remarkably well. The laugh he makes added with a great selection of sound and style of the movie makes it that much creepier. You sort of feel sympathy for Arthur and what he's been through even though, he is committing terrible acts of violence. There is elements of dark comedy which blends well with his character. The plot is strong and the director has done a very good job. This stand-alone movie pays great tribute to previous installents and will be go down as one of the best DC movies ever made."
339,"I HATE THIS MOVIE!!!! It is complete crap. I really don't understand the hype over it. I was watching it and just couldn't watch it till the end.. it was so boring. I made myself go and watch it again till the end, but again there was no way for me to do that. It was extremely boring, made no sense, zero connection to Joker. When I saw people writing that Joaquin is better joker than Heath Ledger I just needed to see that. But now I'm asking myself are these people freaking normal, you just can't put these two names in the same sentence. Joaquin's joker can't and never will be better because it even isn't a joker, it is a disaster."
340,"A total blunder. Joker is the worst kind of movie, pretending it´s deep, philosophical, structured and with a thorough plot. Well, it's nothing of that and it's as hollow as hollow can be. You take an exceptional actor, make him mimic de Niro in Taxi Driver, give him some eccentric dance steps on a staircase, produce a nice trailer, and.... voilá, you fool half of the world with pure nothingness. Joker. What a joke!"
341,"Don't listen to the unbelievably high average score, this is not a great movie. It leans on cliches, it struggles to communicate vital character details, but it manages to pull together a strong closing act to elevate an otherwise inconsistent film.'Joker' stumbles out of the gate by throwing a plethora of ""troubled loner"" cliches at us. The scenes read almost as a list, giving the early stages of the film a disjointed feel that hampers any sense of immersion. The only aspect of our lead, Arthur Fleck, that seems original is his affliction. His sudden outbursts of laughter during tense situations are used to great effect several times throughout the first act.As the story continues, 'Joker' wastes time on a sub-par subplot involving Arthur's neighbor. Another sub-plot, involving Thomas Wayne, is far more interesting and clever in its execution.Ultimately, 'Joker' becomes a story of Arthur breaking free and flourishing in the chaos of Gotham. The final act revels in his now unrestrained insanity. However, the film struggles to convey a clear image of what exactly is happening within Arthur. Is he an idiot savant, or a brilliant mastermind set free of his bonds. You can go back through the film if you wish and identify plot points to either effect if you wish (the latter seems more likely in retrospect). However, this failure of communication lessens the impact of the film, leaving you somewhat disappointed.Nevertheless, the final act is an exciting close to the film, though it probably should have ended about 5 minutes earlier than it did (the final scene is unneeded). Regardless, the result is a unique and fascinating comic book movie held back from greatness by a shaky start and questionable communication."
342,"The objectively WORST VERSION OF THE JOKER ever done in film. And you laughably clueless, delusional loser neckbeards are calling it a MASTERPIECE just because you saw every other pseudo-intellectual geekoid doing the same thing??? LOL get a grip, freakshows. This pathetic Taxi Driver/King of Comedy rip-off was absolutely EMBARRASSING."
343,"A very good movie, undoubtedly worthy of all the awards that they give it and even so there would be few"
344,"Joaquin nailed it, I hope the sequel will be more darker than what we've got..I hope Joaquin consider to join The Batman 2021 sequel as The Joker!"
345,"The title says it all.To whoever that cares.The story about Joker is believable and human. So far away from that blatant garbage that most marwell and superhero movies tries to shovel down your throat. This movie actually respect your intellect and integrity. It's the story of the underdog, the unseen and the neglected. It's also a story about the broken. About someone who quits hope and looks for a more meaningful road to travel. It is wild and raw. And it is destructive. But it shows a healthy reaction towards the sickness experienced in a society that lost it's ways paired with multiple personal sorrows. This all adds up to breaking point and the revelation of Joker.Enjoy."
346,The story was so great. And the acting was fabulous. The character is so inspiring to us. Never got bored watching this.
347,It Really Stands Out. It's Real Cinema. It's Art. It's Must Watch. 9/10.
348,"First of all he film is a prophecy. The outcome is depressive but very realistic looking on it from our days events. Social unjustice creates the caos, so impressively demonstarated in the movie. It is one of the bests I ever seen."
349,"Overrated. I can't remember the last time something so wholly unoriginal received so much praise. An honest 6/10 with the name of everyone's favorite comic book character and boom; suddenly, all the ciné-unknowledgeable cartoon fanatics call it Best Picture. I swear to you, if this film was just a story about some guy named Arthur Fleck who was the influence behind this citizen revolution, this film would go unnoticed and disliked. A robbery of a film with a pinch of Arkham added into it gets called Joker and boom, since he's your favorite comic book character, this becomes one of the best films of the year and decade, eh? And it's directed by the same guy who made the stupid Hangovers and Roadtrip, lol.And oh, you're ""cInEpHiLeS"" and ""aRt iS sUbJeCtIvE"", I almost forgot about that part. I could really go on and explain my review in detail but nah.Here we go: ""wOw wOw wOw dId yOu jUsT iMpLy jOkEr iSn'T 10/10? yOu bLeEpInG lOsErRr"""
350,"It is the baddest overrated movie I've ever seen in my life, is the people going to be zombies soon ??"
351,"I understand why people are excited for this film and I'm afraid it's clouded everyone's judgement. There are some insane flaws in this story regardless of it being an original origin story. While trying to pull from such films as King of Comedy, Taxi Driver and Fight Club to attempt at bringing a fresh look at The Joker there is 1 major glowing flaw in everyone face that I have yet to see anyone talk about.
In any origin story you bring to the character the Joker it all leads to the same road, an enemy in Batman. We can all agree on that, without that regardless of origin story you have no Joker character at all.
So explain to me how Arthur being at least 30 and that's being kind because let be honest, he looks no younger than 40 in this film, is going to fight Bruce aka Batman who we see him interact with at the age of at the oldest 12. By the time Bruce would become Batman the Joker will be pushing 65/70.
The film is lost the second we see Arthur and Bruce on screen.
Had this film been a story about a young boy who was troubled and saw Arthur character this inspiring the Joke I would have loved it. Unfortunately it's not and everyone seems excited to see Batman fight a Joker in a wheelchair with this origin story.
Heath will forever own this role and the character should stop there."
352,"Cannot understand why this movie gets high score. The content is so bad, gloomy and unreasonable. It is exaggerated too much. How can a mad guy who kill 03 men become a symbol for a mad society??? How can rich men always badly treat or make difficulty to poor guy??? Any reason for a mad crowd tries to protest a senator who is just only standing as a candidate for President position???
Three stars for the good performance of main character."
353,Why in the hell would they make a movie like that... There are enough problems in the world
354,"Everybody must have watched this movie with blinders on .it is not Oscar worthy ,boring as hell no dialogue or story to speak of .you cannot compare him to Heath Ledger or Jack Nicholson .His laugh is horrible.People are gullible spending money to see trash like the blairwitch project .I rated 1 star only cause couldn't do 0"
355,"Cinematography and acting was perfect , and they story depend on personal perception , it will get deep in your soul if you put your self in arthur situation ."
356,"Heath Ledger or Joaquin Phoenix? Here is the question. Except that in my mind there is no question. 100% Heath Ledger. And here is the reason why: while Ledger was perfect comic book character, Phoenix' character is more disturbing version of Joker. He is mentally ill and seriously needs help. I don't say that Ledger's joker wasn't crazy, He was somewhat crazy but in that movie everything is done in a way that we know it's comic book movie, good versus bad and that's it. 2019 Joker is more disturbing. There is a lot of emotion put in this movie which one would say is good thing but it's done in such manner that somehow we feel sorry for character and somehow even justify his actions. Violence is never the answer. No matter how bad your life is or how many people have hurt you, it is never an option. However, the creators of this movie seem to think differently. There you can hear triumphant music playing when Joker killed all those people. Also, movie is a shock value, unoriginal and uninspiring. The Dark Knight was really interesting movie to watch, everything was somewhat coherent in there. In Joker we have a lot of dancing, laughing, killing and mental breakdowns. To sum up - it's trash."
357,Way over dramatized. It's another case of Hollywood high on themselves.
358,"Morally, I dislike the depiction of mental disturbances relating to violence.Filmographically, this movie tries to ""terrorise"" the spectator. Strip it from the terrorising narative and violence, the only thing left is a use of mental disturbances."
359,"Watched the movie, it was a great performance by Joaquin Phoenix, but it was a performance of a man going insane. The story being about Joker is an offshoot. The Thomas Wayne character is overdone and cocky. DO NOT see this movie as a DC comic version of the Joker it is not."
360,"Amazing story, writing and acting. A superb comic book and regular crime drama movie. It's the origin of Joker from Detective comics #1 in 1940 by Bill Finger and Jerry Robinson, the deep dive character study of Taxi Driver with story elements of Kings of Comedy.10/10"
361,"Best Joker adaption ever, everything dark you'd want from such a character and I smiled throughout! Well worth every penny. Perfect amount of madness and incredible soundtrack. I don't even have complaints I am very satisfied - I absolutely love the profoundness in it. Joaquin Phoenix and Health Ledger are the best Jokers we'll have. I really hope this get nominated for the Oscars I'd dance a wild jig! Also this is my 550th review which is really cool!"
362,"This movie is absolute perfection, I was lucky enough to see this at a festival and WOW. Phoenix's performance is incredible and so deep into the role. He truely shows how damaged the joker should be portrayed as. He will definitely be at the top for best actor. The movie is disturbing and terrifying of how the world is to people with mental health and deserves to at least be nominated best picture."
363,"I'm dumbfounded this film gets such a high IMDB rating.If this was meant to be some kind of social commentary on the ravages of mental illness, it could have been done without hijacking one of the most colorful characters in the Batman comic book genre.Viewers are held hostage to two hours of somber, relentless depression, murder, and mayhem. There are endless shots of a solitary, anguished Joaquin Phoenix, which get pretty monotonous.In a nutshell: adopted boy suffers brain damage from a brutal father, lives with a sick mentally ill mother, and, after getting beat-up by street hooligans, builds a self-pitying clown alter-ego that's going to hold up a mirror to a dismissive society. *Yawn*Of all the actors who have played Joker, Heath Ledger got the right balance of being a scary, crazed, murderous, diabolically clever sociopath who could go toe-to-toe with Batman. The pathetic, hapless Phoenix character lacks all of that persona.Yes, Phoenix does an outstanding performance worthy of an Oscar. But that alone doesn't save a film that is a boring flop because it is monotone, dark, dour, and mostly pointless."
364,"Great performance by Joaquin Phoenix, dull story-line.."
365,Joaquin Phoenix did everything he could with this material but it just doesn't seem to have a point whether for lack of having one or cowardice to say something. It even is set back in time to avoid being too current.Are the rich bad? Is exploitation bad? Is our viral culture bad? Is how we treat the mentally ill bad? Nothing is seriously discussed or focused on at all and even when it comes closest to these points it undermines them immediately.Then there's the outright plagiarism from The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver.I firmly believe that if this wasn't about the Joker most people wouldn't care one bit.
366,Everyone should riot and be violent? The actor's skill isn't that great. Just laugh. Anyone can do that. Joker nominated for Academy award is a joke.
367,"I was tricked by the hype and people calling this masterpiece and best movie of the year. Well... it is NOT!Misleading name of the movie would indicate this is prequel of Batman and there is a bit - Bruce Wayne parents were killed.... but not by Joker as you may think.
The rest is psychological drama.Plot is nothing special. Far from spectacular.Acting is shallow. Disappointing and plastic (hysterical laughing). Too much killing. Should be R rated movie.Environment (the venue) is terrible. Was the idea to show all around falling apart, dirty streets, rotten apartments, rubbish everywhere?
Then riots and trashing shops, taking TVs and VCRs... was this already in Robocop and Police Academy? We did not move on from 80s?And people crazy, violent, bullying... What a poor way to portray society! There is not a bit of happiness. Is this kind of stage we appreciate and call the movie ""masterpiece""?Time and money is gone. Can't un-watch this. Can't delete it!
And should give a thought earlier by seeing whole lot of 10/10 reviews that something is not right.Not recommend for watching. There are plenty of movies out there (and I exclude ""Avengers"" from the selection)."
368,"This movie is absolutely amazing!! Those giving it a bad review obviously have no clue what an origin movie is about. It is slow at first but obviously it's gotta work it's way up by telling us the story of how he became. Joaquin Phoenix doesn't disappoint in this movie, he nailed the role. I loved every bit of it."
369,"A thought-provoking, disturbing 2 hours long journy will haunt you for a long time. Thanks to tod phillips with an diffrent style of telling a story with an impeccable performance by Joaquin Phoenix, it is an unbelievable cinema experinece with creating a new genra of cinema as art!"
370,"It's not every year that an actor can get to the top with a unique role. Playing the fictional character the Joker has been tried for many decades by various actors but the closest one to the original was Heath Ledger who won an oscar for the role. Now, it's Joaquin who has taken the lead. A disenchanted individual who tries to cope with life as it hands out grime and dirt in its most ruthless form, starts to take it's toll on Arthur Fleck (Joaquin) who was adopted by his disillusioned mother who suffered severe psychiatric problems. Stemmed with endless turmoil in Gotham, Arthur begins to realize what life has to offer. Yet none of it gives Arthur a sense of relief except when he kills starting with three thugs on a subway line. From then on, his mind clears away the hazy images that his medications blocked him with, to advance further and further into his own existential madness.
I found this version of the Joker to be very gratifying, especially as Joaquin nailed the comic clown's persona to a perfect 'T'. Becoming Gotham's crown prince of crime in upsetting the natural order of things as we see it normally. Such as politics, monetary issues, or just living day to day in a world of chaos brimming with upheaval and despair that surrounds us all. Director, Todd Phillips was brilliant in showing us the gritty, dirty streets laced with crime in all corners. Not just the for the elite, but for all levels of humans who want to escape but can't for reasons of either insanity or just plain nostalgia that all people relate to when they move into a new corner of the world.
It is a clear reminder that for the most part, people from all walks of life can only stand so much criticism when they do their jobs, or need to be recognized for their value or contributions to society. When such acts of decadence leaks inward to affect the common man, then the little things begin to build incrementally until it reaches the point of critical mass.
Todd Phillips captured this brilliantly. The music was an incredible match using the early era of the seventies and eighties as a catalyst to the Joker's rise to fame. It helped his madness, it helped mould his persona into the devious creature that helped purge out the elite to their own wasteland while at the same time, had given birth to the Batman. This was an incredible movie, from start to finish. Lots of emotional turmoil, sadness, mind bending plots as to why Arthur plunged into the abyss of chaos. I recommend this film to all fans of the Joker franchise. It doesn't hold a lot of violence, but when it's needed, Phillips delivered perfectly to balance the story's theme."
371,"I love how raw this movie is, the way mental health is being handled in this time and age sadly still applies. Joaquin really did his homework on anxiety. The political ideas are very fresh."
372,Sat down with my husband to watch this and our jaws dropped. This reflect the grim reality of mental illness and has many parallels to reality. 10/10
373,"This is a dark, twisted, sad and sympathetic take of possibly the most enduring comic book villain of all time. DC would be wise to keep taking risks like this and blurring the genre lines because this is where they have a change to excel in an area the MCU won't cross into for fear of not being family friendly. If you cannot match Marvel in an interconnected universe then the answer lies squarely in making quality solo, if not one-off films like this. Phoenix is one of the top actors of his generation and I think it is possible to judge this take on Joker without even comparing to Ledger's. Both are genius and both very different. I have to go off topic and say the one person I'd love to have seen play a live action version was Mark Hamill at the right point in time but we'll have to just give him the best maniacal Joker laugh award and be content with that."
374,The movie is highly overrated...the character building was spot on and so is the Joaquin phoenix's performance... Extremely low on entertainment value...a very dark movie... 5 stars for Joaquin and 2 for the makers
375,"I have no idea what to think of the movie. For two hours of ""entertainment"", walk away. For two of an artistic character study of a very troubled person that should be troubled, go for it. OK, you did the poorly treated creepy clown thing. Also you wonder the message of the crowd. Is the a righteous movement or a force to be stopped at all costs.After I thought of it as an anti-hero character study, go get ""Cool Hand Luke"" or some other great anti-hero movie. You will be entertained and conflicted about the hero with either range of emotions and see great cinema and not wonder what you just watched for two hours."
376,"Reviewing ""Joker"" in ""The New Yorker,"" the great film critic Anthony Lane called it a ""lurid spectacle"" and a ""miserablist manifesto."" Other IMDB user reviews give away the plot, so I won't recap it, and the film FAQ in this database provides an exceptionally lengthy explanation for all the bewildering plot twists and possible motivations for Joaquin Phoenix's disturbing portrayal of a psychopathic killer with so many mental disorders it is impossible to name them all. Watching this film is like being subjected to a two-hour nightmare--not of anything in the viewer's brain or for that matter in the mind of the main character--unless it's a reminder to take your meds. No, it's all about the writer/director's attempt to cash in on our national cynicism. Although the movie pretends to be on the side of the poor, the abused, and the downtrodden, it also suggests that the evil media, the complacent rich, law enforcement, social workers, and just about every sane person in ""Gotham"" (read New York City) is part of an evil cabal that has taken control of the world. Just in case serial killer John Wayne Gacy didn't sound the death knell for professional clowns, this movie tries its best to do so. Other good films have been made about the insane taking over the asylum but never with this much cold calculated cash in mind and so little insight into insanity itself.""I happen to dislike the film as heartily as anything I've seen in the past decade,"" Anthony Lane said in his September 2019""New Yorker"" review, ""but I realize, equally, that to vent any inordinate wrath toward it is to fall straight into its trap, for outrage merely proves that our attention has been snagged. Just ask the President of the United States."""
377,"I think this is a movie for Batman or comic fans?
As a stand-alone movie I didn't really care for it.
Nothing really happened, a guy was sad and depressed and killed another guy.
Nothing impressive"
378,"The main problem I have with this movie is that it portrays the life of a mentally challenged person... and that's it. The movie never expands on it. He never progresses as a character.I know this movie attracts a lot of people who identify with him, and this will only reinforce their beliefs. Why not show those people that they can change? Introduce a new character, make him go through a life changing experience, just show us there's a way.So, those are the people that care about the character, but what about the other half?Well, personally, towards the end of the movie, I just couldn't care about him anymore. I understand that he's been rejected by society, but does that justify the death of 5-6 people? I don't think so.Should we care more about people like him? Yes, we should. Does this movie make me want to care about people like him? No, it doesn't."
379,I was so excited to watch this because of all the hype and I was so disappointed!! In real life people are just not this mean and I found it ridiculous that rich people = bad and poor people are so down trodden and everyone is mean to them . Americans are nice and kind and this movie could have had some balance and then it would have been believable. Even his own mother is a terrible crazy child abuser! I hate this movie and found it unbelievable
380,"This movie reminded me of Kubrick's version of Stephen King's THE SHINING. It has the same sense of darkness enveloping the characters. But, like Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), Arthur Fleck is manic - a maniac, really - from the start. The violence escalates (and how - I can't believe this movie got away with a 15 rating), but there's no real explanation of what made Arthur the way he is. Thanks to all the other movies in the Batman franchise, we know where the Joker is headed, but we need an 'origins' prequel to this one.Robert de Niro, playing a talk-show host, brings a reminder of dark roles he has vividly brought to life. But Joaquin Phoenix's performance, like Heath Ledger's in 2008, is a tour-de-force: over the top, and then some.A deeply disturbing movie. And worryingly likely to be seen as celebrating violence."
381,Boring film. Kept waiting for it to get going. Joaquin Phoenix (who is normally one of my favorite actors) was irritating and monotonous. I honestly could not wait for this film to end.
382,"Phoenix was over the top spooky and I guess very good in this role, but as a movie there wasnt much there. His mom played by Frances Conroy was good. I admire her talent, DeNiro doesnt move me much the past few years (decades?) and his teeth look like Martin Scorsese used some CGI magic left over from the Irishman to whiten them. I think the high rating for the film here are based on Phoenix's performance and not the film. A performance which I fear we will one day view as overrated."
383,"In terms of production this film is on the A lost, however, I failed to draw any entertainment or value from this movie. Dont recommend it at all."
384,"Its depressing and it doesn't give any good message to the people , somehow its gives the face of our society cruelty and the truth ."
385,"Take the next ingredients :
The King of ComedyRequiem for a DreamThe Dark KnightTaxi DriverMix all of these and then ladys and gentlemans we have : Joker ."
386,"An origin's tale which does justice to one of the most iconic villains in cinematic history. A breathtaking performance by Phoenix brings a new perspective to the audience's perception of the Joker's enigmatic persona.Led by Todd Phillips' sharp direction, the film portrays the tale on a very dark canvas in the backdrop of a Gotham city in hopeless turmoil. The film is punctuated by a negative vibe throughout, courtesy of the dark tones, the filthy alleyways, graffiti-filled walls of Gotham city and Fleck's sombre mindset.Phillips is able to carefully thread through the scenes to show the birth and evolution of this ""mentally-ill loner"" who is knocked down time and again by the city's fragile societal structure as well as discoveries about his disturbed past. In the process, he gives us a powerful insight into his mind and how it breaks down beyond repair, probably epitomised by the moment when he murders his own beloved mother.A mind-boggling watch overall, which is excruciatingly painful yet beautiful at the same time, with the laughter ""condition"" acting as a perfect foil to this legendary character."
387,"Joker could have been a good movie. Joaquin Phoenix did a great job, but in my opinion, the character he is playing is not believable. In a world full of extremes and evil characters (with a very tiny exception, sorry for the bad pun), the Joker's destiny and shattering past are lost in the chaotic, dark environment. His state of mind and supposed mental illness are not further explained. In a more realistic setting (like New York instead of Gotham) this might have been more convincing.Sadly, this Joker is not even the same we see in the Batman movies. No Introduction to the ""why so serious"" slogan we know him for, no explanation for the scar across his face neither. Still the connection to the Waynes is elaborated very much, even though most viewers exactly know what's going to happen to them and therefore eliminates all possible tension.Especially the first hour or so is pretty boring. Some people around me even fell asleep in the cinema, something I have not seen in quite some time in the movies. CGI are well done and unintrusive. I didn't notice them for most parts of the movie (which is good).The Movie tries to be deep, shocking and touching, but is, for me, unrelateable, unbelievable and, yes, pretty boring. The Joker is too cartoonish to be believable, too shallow to be touching. Compared to similarly connected movies like Birdman, it falls short."
388,"The first half was boring the second was a bit better. The actor did a good job, however overall average movie. Nothing special."
389,"Do not get the love for this film at all...I didn't see the need for a Joker origin story but the trailer came along & looked pretty good. So I went in prepared to enjoy this Elseworld version of the Joker.Problem was, The Joker didn't turn up for his own film.Just some bloke who worked as a clown who had various knocks thrown at him which caused him to murder some guys (in self defence) & then shoot someone else Not a bad film as films go, but certainly not a Joker I recognise. No desire to ever watch this again..."
390,"JOKER review:
A brilliant movie. Outstanding Phoenix. Genius Todd Phillips. BEAUTIFULLY HAUNTING."
391,"It's just a bad movie. It is slow, boring and disturbing."
392,"Aside from Joaquin Phoenix's performance being brilliant, I didn't enjoy the movie at all. The movie was slow & stayed on the same platitude."
393,"Wow ...what a movie and what an actor ,
Go ahead and watch it, it really worth it,
I've already seen it twice in three days."
394,"I personally loved the film but, let's be honest, you don't care what I think.
Why would you... you don't even know me.No, YOU want to know if YOU'LL like the film and are looking for signs (occasionally hidden deep inside an ocean of egocentric opinions) as to whether or not you will.The answers simple.If you want, or are expecting, ANY semblance of a ""comic book"" movie there's a good chance you'll be disappointed. It's not. And it doesn't attempt to be.The common comparison of ""If you like Taxi Driver, you'll love this"" is over-simplified yet astoundingly accurate.
It's true. If you're a fan of Taxi Driver, or similar films, you'll be right at home laughing (when you shouldn't be) along with Joker.The acting's outstanding across the board. Cinematography is absolutely fantastic. Everything from set design to editing add to the fact we now have another (rare) classic-in-the-waiting film that happens to draw from a comic book series."
395,"Going into the theater I already had a very high expectation, but it was no where close to how good this movie and the acting actually is.... This movie is an art piece."
396,"This movie is slow but never makes you feel bored. The story is narrated in a wonderful manner. This movie sets a good example for others comic based movies that how can a negative character can be portrayed in such a manner that you though know joker in not a good man but will be feeling bad for him at some point.
The acting done by Joaquin Phoenix who played the role of joker was amazing. He was flawless and did proper justice with the character of joker which very few actors were able to do. Joaquin Phoenix is a brilliant method actor.
This is a movie made to see in movie theatre not at tv or any streaming app."
397,"As heath ledger's joker said ""madness is like gravity all you need is a push"" Joaquin through his performance has proved it. Through the movie one will witness the fall of a man and the rise of the Joker. Brilliant performance by Joaquin."
398,"A masterpiece, one of the best movies of tge decade and century"
399,"This film start with man ""Arthur"" doing makeup, his signboard stole by a bunch of teenagers, he chase them and he beat up by the teenagers scene! As turnout, this film is about a man who having laughing issue and violent behavior, want to become a comedian! Entire film full of super boring overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the annoying laughing scene, overuse of the watching news and TV show scene, overuse of the song playing at the background scene, and overuse of the slow motion super boring dancing scene! Barely laughable scene is, Arthur want to get past a door with motion sensor, turnout it's only for exit! Barely intense scene is, Arthur stab his friend ""Randall"" to death! This scene quite bloody and detail! At the end, Arthur kill his mother and his idol ""Murray""! He having accident and save by two men from the crowd, he awake and dancing! His violent act also indirectly causing the killing of Batman's parents! At the very end, Arthur having conversation with a therapist at the asylum and running at the hallway! That's it! Another big disappointed film of the year!"
400,Don't understand what's so entertaining about this. This is one sick depressing dark film. this is like using art to trigger murders. Absolute sick movie! Agenda is clear..!
401,"The acting is good but they waste the movie time with repeating the same subject there is a missing part in movie to give attention to the storyline
Just watched him laughing only and the repeated it many times for nothing
Actually i did not complete the last 10 minutes as it was boring and each time tried to leave i was saying just give it another 10 minutes maybe something will happen but really nothing"
402,Absolutely stellar performance by Joaquin Phoenix. His portrayal of Joker is so realistic and gripping. Emotions overload.
403,"Wow just wow, I was skeptical going in thinking anyone would come close to ledger or hamills jokers, but this THIS is nothing short of a performance of a lifetime by phoenix, he has BLOWN ME AWAY!"
404,"Amazing, Fabulous, Smashing, Masterpiece, every second of this deserve a big clap
Tod Phillips made it like every joker fan wanted, if Joaquin doesn't get Oscar then we must check the last oscar winings!"
405,"I haven't sat through the entire credits in stunned silence since ''let the right one in"" baring no resemblance to this movie whatsoever I was left completely speechless as to what I'd just witnessed. The term masterpiece is thrown around alot these days but Jaquin's nailed on performance of one of society's forgotton tormented souls that inevitabley arcs into the fragile but brutal criminal psychopath we know as the joker is understatedley 'perfect' to a level where the viewer is left to almost encourage Aurthur's inevitable wrong doings and sucker you into morally second guessing yourself with 'is he actually doing wrong?'
I could go on but there are many other reviews for you to read that will say everything I would have said about the cinematography, music, sound,direction,set pieces, un-nerving tension, the violence, the twists and every other reason we love movies which Joker pulls off so so well.
If you've not already booked to see it just drop what your doing and book.
Just dont expect a superhero movie."
406,"An epic masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix gives his best performance ever. Best comic movie ever and also one of the most favorite movie, loved it."
407,"Joker is an escape into a sociopathic dark drama produced as an independent film with a big budget cast. Todd Phillips wrote , produced and directed this cinematic catastrophe. Phoenix was brilliant in the portrayal of a broken-hearted villain, he simply read the script he was paid for. The concern returns to Todd Phillips. His filmography includes a variety of B movie comedies, Old School & Hangover being his claim to fame. Joker is not a comedy or an action throwback to the DC comics. Joker is a dismal depressing depiction from a director who is obviously illustrating his own internal darkness."
408,"'Joker' is a sick, disgusting, dark, evil, violent, total piece of scheisse. It will seriously affect emotionally troubled young people already pulled at by suicide, addictive behaviors, and hopelessness. It's like a 'Triumph of the Will' for nihilists. I would defer from voting for Joaquin Phoenix for best actor until i see video of his normal non-acting self...it may be he wasn't acting in 'Joker' at all and is one majorly screwed up dude. And, what a weird alien body. He's naked from the waist up a lot in 'Joker' and, from the waist up, is, let's say, disquieting. All taut skin stretched tightly over an alien bone structure. The bones stick up and out at odd angles, in odd places, like the exoskeleton of a medical experiment gone wrong. Not a single pleasant moment in the movie. Not a moment of joy, nor beauty, nor happiness. No catharsis from all the misery and violence, just a stomach churning emptiness at the thought that the last fifty years have come down to this, and this is a circle of despair. A movie without hope, without humanity, showing a world that no sane person would live in."
409,"Travis Bickle is also an anti-hero like Arthur Fleck, so many bad things at once, a product of the times, but his actions are never justified or rendered aspirational either through plot or aesthetics of the film. The same goes for Rupert Pupkin in Scorsese's another masterpiece 'The King of Comedy' from which Todd Philips, the director, heavily borrows but without any proper insight or thought. Class divide, neurological issues, childhood trauma and all that glitter is thrown in the movie to disguise the shallow depth of ideas and adds to the confusion. The film tries to be so many things and ends up being none. 'Poser' would be a better title.Joaquin Phoenix's acting is everything though. Very familiar but still feels fresh and knocks your socks off (and oh that laugh is haunting) and he was the singular reason I didn't walk out of the film after the first 15 minutes because the moment Arthur Fleck commits the third murder (and which obviously was not a self-defense tactic), I thought, ""lo beta, ghus gaye na ghhade me! Yahan se impossible hai nikalna."" And making my worst fears come true, this humorless film just kept on digging that first act grave.So, in short: Loved Joker. Just hated the film he was in.PS: Watch HBO's 'Succession' if you want to take notes on how to have a people as your protagonists, humanize them and still maintain that much-necessary ironic distance from them."
410,"Casting was really good. No crazy surprise breakaway performances - everybody fit their parts and held their own (which is hard in the face of Phoenix and DeNiro).But the way the story unfolds, the foreshadowing, the grand revelations - absolutely masterful! Nobody would ever expect such good writing to be invested in a comic book villain origin story, but alas..."
411,"Joaquin the Great..
The Joker Genius.
Creativity in writing, directing and acting.
Incredibly crazy, but rational mad."
412,I don't know what else I can say. Movie left me speechless.
413,"This is not a really good Movie.This Movie is whatever people can say, when they so not find words after seeing it.2hrs with a Villain ......I wont Spoil this great experience. I would be the Villain If I would do.Thank you Todd Phillips."
414,"It was one of the best movies I have ever seen. The dark, tragic and well planned development of an innocent lonely man towards a brave symbol of awareness, resistance and revolution. Editing, soundtracks and direction was brilliant and breathtaking."
415,"This movie is a rally to the bottom of obscurity - I strongly suggest not watching it if you can. It is, simply put: psychologically draining.The quality of the plot is mixed. It has some interesting suspense on how it all might end. Nevertheless, in reality some other parts of are rather predictable and obvious.Additionally, the rhythm is rather dull and it has none of the action you would see in the dark night (if that's what your looking for).It's also bothering to see how it portrays a divide in a troubled society. Even though we know Gotham is product of fiction, it draws parallels to our society - exacerbating its negative sides - while trying to make them appear normal.Also beware that some of the scenes are utterly grotesque. The violence is quite explicit and unlike other films - realistic."
416,"This movie will affect you. It speaks to society, it speaks to the human condition, it speaks to our darker instincts. It's gritty, human, and in some small way profound.It's beautifully shot, artistic, very well acted, the the score is absolutely effective and well done. I don't rate this 10 lightly. It's not a film to be merely entertained, but it is a ride, and it's a film to talk about. See it, it's rare something like this comes along."
417,I am a DC fan but this movie is a art house movie pretending to be a comic book movie. Boring and drawn out.
418,"Tge film is too Slowt gets boring
Ok story line
Good acting from joker
I dont know what all this hype is about"
419,"Wasnt sure if I'd be a fan of seeing the jokers origin story on the big screen specially as half the appeal to the joker is the mystery of his origin baring the red hood origin anyway. Thought it was a brilliant watch seeing his slow decent and learning how his tragic upbringing molded him. The ending when emerged as the finished product ""the joker"" honestly dont think an origin story could of been none better and the acting performance from Joaquin phoenix was top notch!"
420,"Despite an extraordinary performance from Phoenix, the film itself is a sub-par experience. It's Taxi Driver lite, from someone who has seen the far superior film and completely failed to grasp its meaning."
421,"Joker (2019) is ambitious, tragic, meritorious, a dark comedy, exhilarating, and a masterpiece in cinematic storytelling. Director Todd Phillips, after several questions over his ability to direct a praiseworthy Joker film, delivers a classic movie that will be forever enshrined in the memories of those fortunate enough to experience it. Phillips deconstructs the superhero genre and turns it on its head, forming a film that feels and IS an artful indie film rather than a prototypical A to B superhero movie. Every scene in the film has purpose for Phillips. There is a love for the story being told and a direct care in the manner it is portrayed. And for this Phillips should be praised. He navigates the complexities around the character of the Joker, introducing a fresh take while also attempting to pay homage to movies such as Taxi Driver and King of Comedy. Yet, the movie never falters, not even for a second. It moves through each scene not just feeling new, but breathtaking beautiful that will have you applauding before the credits even roll.Likewise, the details in this film are remarkable, as Phillips not only has one listen to the film, but we actively live in it. We can feel the nasty, garbage-filled streets of Gotham often represented through careful and strategic use of symbolism. But of course, while the movie itself is remarkable, it needs an anchor - the great Joaquin Phoenix.Phoenix delivers the most jaw-dropping performance in a film of the 2000s, and perhaps one of the greatest and most memorable performances of all-time. While the character already complex, Phoenix dives so much into the role that you can hardly recognise him. He is at times funny, delicate, innocent, sometimes he is tragic, heartbreaking, and at times he is the dangerous, horrifying, and unpredictable. Through his complex play on the ranging emotions of one Arthur Fleck, Phoenix becomes the epitome of the Joker.So is this the best comic book movie of all time? For most moviegoers that will be the question. And this film transcends the genre in a manner that has not been done since 2008. Likewise, while the Joker movie is more of a tragedy or even comedy than it is a superhero movie (imagine an indie film with DC characters), with the inclusion of superheros, or supervillains in this case, it will always be a superhero movie.So where does it stand amongst other CBMs? It is top 2, battling with another film that featured the Joker, The Dark Knight."
422,"Unrelentingly, irredeemably dark with no story, no arc, and lots of unnecessary frames left onscreen. Too long by 1/3
Phoenix delivers a fine performance, better because the material he had to work with was so weak and thin. I wanted to walk out from the halfway point onward but kept hoping for a redeeming 3rd reel.
Nope. Just more and increasingly gratuitous violence, more darkness and attempts to clumsily weave in origin stories we have all seen. Saw this for $1.72 on a Season Pass and wanted my money back."
423,Thank goodness I didn't bring my little one with me. Me and my older kids enjoyed it. This movie is very dark and violent. One of the best prequels I have ever seen. Mr. Phoenix really deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of the Joker. This one of my top two movies this year. Almost two and a half hours long but worth it!
424,"What an actor! Absolutely brilliant, loved it ! An Oscar winning performance for sure !"
425,"This is my first review on this site and I must say 10/10
Just saw it a while ago. No words to describe the phoemix´s job
Yes! Its one of the best movies of all time
and the oscar goes to...."
426,"Absolutely one of the best movies I have seen, and will see again...I enjoyed every twist, turn, and the furthering of the evolution of the character and the slow and drastic turn to violence and chaos at a whim. Fantastic movie!"
427,"If it was supposed to send a message, it didn't. If it was supposed to be entertaining, it wasn't. If it was supposed to be insightful, guess what?Was very excited to watch this as it had all the correct people offended, lefty loser types. One hour thirty minutes into the two hour film and it finally started. Even still it wasn't enough to even remotely lift me from boredom and STILL nothing happens. predictable and insulting simple all the way through.Had to keep reminding myself this is an origin movie about The Joker. There was nothing ""Joker"" about him. A dim witted, unintelligent weirdo loser. A string of predictable mistreatment scenarios won't turn that /\ into a cunning and dangerous, unpredictable criminal mastermind that has an entire city and its police force running around in circles. The Joker's image... ruined of this film is taken seriously. How DC let the useless hollywood clowns use their character after reading the script is beyond me. Maybe everyone in film has gone doolally. It was desecration of a world renowned fictional villain.Phoenix really didn't do a great job either. Very frustrating watching his forced uncontrollable cringey laugh. Acting like a weirdo isn't all that difficult, anyone can do it.Be wary of anyone who loved it. So far when asked what they loved about it they all seem to give a generic abstract answer like ""I liked that it was from a different point of view"" as if they could never have imagined predictable cliche scenarios even if they have not actually lived through one. What next? watching The Wolf of Wall Street and saying ""omg I've never ever imagined being rich, it really opened my eyes"". Most people loved it because they were supposed to.If you have even the tiniest desire to be entertained by creative story telling or plots DO NOT EXPECT ANYTHING from this film."
428,"Hildur Guðnadóttir thank you for the amazing soundtrack!!!
Joaquin Phoenix is outstanding. The Joker from a completely different perspective.
He laughs and at the same time he can show all kinds of emotions with his eyes.
Just incredible."
429,It would take me hours to describe my feelings for this movie.I went to the cinema expecting to see a great performance from Phoenix...but...it wasnt just him....Everything was great the story the music the photography directing...Phoenix will win the oscar (im sorry for the rest of the contestants)..Everything is just WOW about him ...what a great movie ...Just a reminder to Hollywood that a great script with a great acting has no need of special effects or cgi or action scenes or whatever to make the top...Go back to movies like that ..make sure the story is good and the acting is good and forget about the restCongraz to everyone for that masterpiece...and we the viewers thank you!
430,"It's pretty apparent the modern generation of critics are here to pader to big dumb billion dollar movies. This is an excellent take on the joker and keeps its focus on a mentally ill mans fall into absolute madness. Its dark and requires attention to follow the plot. Unlike your majority modern movies which tend focus on CGI and explosions with brief plot overviews. It also doesn't try to tick boxes to appease the 1%. It focuses on mental illness and the joker. No LGBTQ, Racism, Gun Control, Police Brutality, Women's issues etc..."
431,DC finally gives us a good movie after keeping us waiting for a long time.
432,This movie is an absolute master piece. I have always related myself to the Joker and this movie mirrors how I feel on a day-to-day basis. This movie could not have been made any better. 10/10 Why s0 s3r10s? we really do live in a society.
433,"The one star is for the performance of the main actor. That's it!
I really was expecting an amazing movie according to all the reviews ... but really, it - does - not - make - any - sense.
What in this movie makes it so different that it deserves a 10? On average, users would review that a 6 or an 8 at max.
So i wonder if there hasn't been a scam somewhere telling people: ""Put a ravishing review on Joker and you'll get an iPhone for free!""
The movie is very slow, very repetitive, not surprising, dragging, stupid (Joker seems to be 50 while Bruce is 10 ... So when Batman arrives, is he fighting a septuagenarian ???!!!) ... and dare i say, unoriginal ! All in all, boring!"
434,"The joker went with Heith ledger
I didnt found anything special except the music and the direction...the cast of joakin is brilliant but the story is poor and details are missedNothing that brilliant except the 6 months of commercial advertising"
435,"Joker is the main adversary of Batman. Going back to the 60s where tv where he was crazy and wicked, each version on the big screen has gone up a notch. Jack showed brillance and wicked as did Heath. Their ability to compete with a brilliant Batman was not just based on being the evil Batman, but his equal in brain power.Not so with this pychopath, who was been damaged so bad he shows no intelligence. Just pure evil. And that is not what the Joker is. This Joker is an embarressment and when you walk out of the movie you will know this is not the Joker, this is Michael Myers in clown face.Some of the plot is well thought out, making the rich the true evil and blaiming everything on Thomas Wayne, and Mom Fleck, and bullies and everyone else. And Joker ""coming out"" by killing 3 sleezeball ""stock trader"" types that brought all of this on themselves. The first 2 deserved it and it would have been self defence, but then he hunted down and shot the third in the back as he was trying to get away. From there it was just a horror movie with clownface. Then the upset mobs, tired of their lot in life make him their hero. Kinda like OJ and Trump.No it's not political Joker says, but yes it is. It is preachy and a terrible movie."
436,"This film was too long, too slow and too dark and unnecessarily violent. It was disturbing and uncomfortable to watch. I will give credit for the music selection.Somebody give Joaquin Phoenix a hug and a Xanax."
437,"A country that makes mental health care treatment unaffordable to the poor (great surprise many of them are...), and blames poor people for being unsuccessful, thereby pushing them to the edges of society. Add to that the second amendment and handing out assault riffles to anyone, and there you have it The Perfect Storm.The most symbolic scene in my opinion is when the Joker puts a gun to his head and we see his face painted in red white and blue...An important movie, that will hopefully emphasize the problem, paving a way for a solution."
438,"That should be the title, the worst possible situations solve the worse way possible, over and over, and this what people like? no wonder the World is the piece of crap that is today and going worse by the day, we deserve to be extinct."
439,"Everybody talks about how the great acting, but the story itself is painful. Basically, we're witnessing a mentally ill person to be abused and transformed into a monster. How is this an enjoyable movie? Is there a lesson or anything to be retained after watching this? There was not a single positive character is the movie that we could root for. I am not saying this has to be a feel good movie, be t for me it was a pain to watch suffering throughout the show and almost walked out."
440,"Over rated by many. Interesting attempt, I enjoy the DC films for many reasons - most of which are not included in this script. What are included are too many reality based scenarios - which I watch the DC films to Forget about. Overall, I'd say that a standalone film about a DC villain - doesn't fly."
441,Just came back from the theater. Joaquin is an absolute genius. This movie is not about violence at all..those who think that they just miss the whole point. Be kind to each other. That's all I'm going to say.
442,I can't explain actually that how perfect this film is.
443,"A engaging story, some splendid cinematography, stellar acting. Joaquin Phoenix gave the best performance as a villain since Heath Ledger as Joker. A true Masterpiece"
444,"To appreciate ""Joker"" I believe you have to have either gone through something traumatic in your lifetime (and I believe most of us have) or understand somewhere in your psyche what true compassion is (which usually comes from having gone through something traumatic, unfortunately). An example of dangerous compassion would be to, say, make a film made about the fragility of the human psyche, and make it so raw, so brutal, so balletic that by the time you leave the theatre you not only don't want to hurt anything but you desperately want an answer and a solution to the violence and mental health issues that have spun out of control around us.
-Josh Brolin"
445,"Few modern, mainstream films today can be considered art, but this breaks the mould.I spent the first two thirds of this film in tears, it provoked a very painful reaction from me. Society, in particular, the worst parts of our society, were represented in an extreme way, nonetheless it did depict how we treat each other and especially how we treat people that are different to us.By the time Joker was unleashed, I was actually glad that he felt freed, confident and enacting his revenge on some of the worst people imaginable. By the end of the movie, I was rooting for him. Very odd given the things he was doing.The way in which this film was shot is mesmerising, the cinematography, score and Joaquin's acting are flawless. The film retains the comic book feel but is very real.I've said several times that no interpretation of Joker could eclipse Heath Ledger's, but Joaquin is just next level, some of the best acting I have ever seen.Joker is a masterpiece."
446,"If this film doesn't win several Oscar's, I will eat my hat! Mr Phoenix is sublime. This is an incredible portrayal of a character descending into madness and the most intense I have ever seen. As an actor, JP executes with genius. A great film and the best I've seen all year. Right up there with the greats!!!"
447,"I miss Heath Ledger and can't get enough of his portrayal of Joker. He was intimidating, scary, unpredictable and all other things. In 2016, we got Suicide Squad and Jared Leto as Joker both of which disappointed me very much. After that, I thought that I don't want to see another Joker interpretation on the big screen. I was skeptical when I heard that a standalone Joker movie was in works. Then I heard about the casting of Joaquin Phoenix as Joker and I developed an interest in it because I love his work. He is a method actor and has given some of my favorite performances for example in Her (2013) and The Master (2012). I decided to see the movie in the theater after hearing a lot about the movie, good and bad and I am glad that I saw it.This movie is really good, it exceeded my expectations and Joaquin Phoenix should get an Oscar for his work. He is phenomenal and I was blown away by his performance. His performance alone carries the whole movie and lets you experience and understand the character without saying much. His physique, movements, gestures, grace, way of speaking suggests that he gave his everything to make the character compelling and stand out from other Joker portrayals. He lost 52 pounds for the role. He embodied the character of Joker. Comparing his performance with Heath Ledger will be absurd. There is no common ground for comparison. Both interpretations of Joker are significantly different, the story is different, character motivations are different.Now talking about the story, this is a standalone Joker movie that shows how a man beaten up, neglected and humiliated by the society turns into a maniac. This movie follows Arthur Fleck who works as a party clown and lives with his mother. He wants to be a stand-up comic. He suffers from a condition causing him to laugh uncontrollably. We feel his loneliness, depression, and condition and sympathize with him for it. All the other performances were also very good. This movie isn't that much violent as people are saying it to be, but it makes you feel the violence and it is unsettling. It also allows the viewer to form their perspective about the character. Sometimes you will agree with his actions and sometimes you won't. There are also certain funny scenes in the movie but not everyone may find it funny.The movie is directed by Todd Phillips and he has done an outstanding job. I didn't think that the guy who made The Hangover movies can pull this off, but he did it. He showed that as a filmmaker, he can make more than just R rated comedies. The film is set in 1981 and the period is very well reflected in the movie. The cinematography is top-notch. Shot composition, camera placement, camera movement has been handled well. I was surprised by how good the Gotham city looked, beautiful and dirty at the same time. Each scene had a color scheme. The lights in the surroundings like light from streetlights, cars or the sky illuminated everything with their light. Joker/Arthur Fleck's emotions get conveyed through shades of light falling on him which is beautiful to look at. Music is beautiful, chilling, hypnotizing and speak lengths about the inner feelings of the character.I have just a few issues with the plot of the movie and how some things happen which shouldn't have happened or couldn't have happened, rest the movie is flawless."
448,Just give Joaquin Phoenix he's Oscar and end the year
449,"Just came home from the cinema. My five cents: It's basically taxi driver 2 with a Joaquin phoenix overplaying pretty much every scene. I thought it was entertaining and beautifully shot, but not my favourite movie of the year. And come on, that ending with him at the show admitting killing those three guys without anyone doing anything. That was a bit too much."
450,"Well, this was certainly quite an anticipated movie, and just to think that it was made by the guy that came up with The Hangover. Then again this film is certainly not a pleasant movie by no means, but that certainly does not necessarily mean that it is a bad movie. Yeah, it is meant to make you feel really uncomfortable, and in a way you sort of also feel a lot of sympathy for the main character. In a way, by the end of the film, I am really wanting him to actually become the Joker, though of course this is all left in Limbo with the way the ending actually comes about.One thing I have to say is that Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely outstanding. I remember people suggesting that nobody could ever top Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker, and of course there was Jared Leno who came along with Suicide Squad, yet Joaquin Phoenix truly moves this character to a completely new level. Yeah, we all suspected that the Joker was crazy, but the way Phoenix captures the dark insanity of the character, the way he captures his mental illness, is absolutely outstanding.Thus, what begs the question is, could he actually be the Joker that we all know and love (and if it wasn't for the fact that the Joker is a much loved villain we wouldn't have got this movie - in fact I'm not at all sure if there is any other villian out there that could literally have a movie of their own). The reason I say this is because Phoenix's Joker is seriously disabled, yet when we encounter the Joker elsewhere, while he might pretend to be crazy, he all know that he has his wits about him.The thing is that I don't believe that Phoenix's Joker could actually be the 'clown-prince of crime' because, well, I'm not entirely sure whether he is actually capable of interacting with people, let alone being the calculating criminal that he is famous for. The reason is that he really doesn't seem to be capable of being able to interact with people. In fact, he is more of a symbol, this is something that slowly becomes relevant as the movie progresses, until we get to the end. Of course, the ending is very ambiguous, and some of the suggestions that he is a joker as opposed to The Joker, really doesn't sit with me all that well.However, in a way it sort of makes sense, him being a symbol and all that. One suggestion, and it is a suggestion that I sort can agree with, is that he actually died in the car crash (something that isn't all that surprising considering he was hit by an ambulance on the side of the car in which he was sitting), and the crowds removed him carefully, as if he was some sort of martyr. Sure, the final scene certainly doesn't suggest that he is in heaven or anything, but the thing is that many characters literally take on a force of personality, one in which the actual person could never fulfill, and Arthur is certainly no leader, not in that sense of the word, and as such he can really only exist as a symbol.Yet we must remember that there is so much about this film that we simply do not know what is truth and what is hallucination. The thing is that Arthur is seriously disconnected from reality, that becomes pretty clear with the 'relationship' that he has with the woman down the hallway. Yeah, once that becomes clear, and it should not have been any surprise as all, it really throws into a lot of doubts what is actually happening, what is real and what is not. Then again, there are a lot of scenes going on in the background, which do give us hints that there certainly is a reality that is unfolding, which means that he certainly did kill the three men on the subway, and murdered Murray live on national television.Yet even Thomas Wayne, a character that is certainly not held in such high regard in this film, has an ambiguous side to him. Then again, in the other Batman films, we see so little of the character that he is seen as some angelic figure. Yet in this film, once again, the truth, and the reality, are two completely different things. Still, the whole question of whether he did have an affair with Arthur's mother, and that Arthur is actually his illegitimate son, is certainly thrown into a lot of doubt.So, yeah, this is a pretty awesome film, and it is certainly one of those films that is going to leave you thinking and trying to understand it for quite a while after leaving the cinema. Honestly, it is pretty good that we are starting to see more of these movies come into the cinema now, after a very long drought full of a bunch of quite sub-par action flicks."
451,"You've kept LEDGER alive ..!!
he must be looking down ,and smiling ..!!
this is the greatest tribute to master of acting Heath leadger..!!
TODD PHILIPS take a bow..!!"
452,"With some real good facial muscle exercises and some new condition display ...when disappointed starts un controllable laughs ... The screenplay, story illogical gun firing murders leave us clueless ! We have seen heroics of Joker in Batman and By Raj in an Indi Cinema but here one fails to laugh. Neither enjoyable as Joker's personal tragedy is going crime provoked path. Difficult to digest senseless out come of incidences. It measurably becomes a pot boiler. It's a fashion to rate this movie high just to give more complexity."
453,Phoenix provides the best acting ever. It's not the movie of the it's the movie of the DECADE.
454,"Normally I write the long review, but I'm going to keep it simple and concise this time.Without spoiling anything -- I suggest you do not read critics' reviews and watch this with a moderate expectation -- this film is an unexpected masterpiece, and the best comic book-based adaptation since Superman (1978).I have seen plenty of superhero movies, and I concur with Martin Scorsese's criticism of that as ""not cinema"" even though I differ with Scorsese's own output as self-indulgent and pretentious (in particular The Departed and Hugo were bloated and awful).However, Joker should be officially considered ""kino"" which is German for cinema, and utilized as a code of sorts among the Internet culture crowd to indicate ""encore; masterpiece; outstanding"".Watching this achieved something I did not expect, and that is of astonishment and catharsis. For that, my hat off to the reformed DC studio (which fired CEO after Justice League movie as a mega-flop to replace with a new leader) and Warner Bros that gave Todd Phillips and co. the chance to produce the bravest ""heavy and dark with the purpose"" cinema since, say, Fight Club, the latter I disliked but understood its messages.Joaquin Phoenix will not only own the Best Actor Oscar, but also that this film will sweep the Oscars with Todd winning Best Director and possibly Best Picture (Bradley Cooper being one of the producers)."
455,This movie gave me goosebumps and kept me on my toes for its entire duration. Joaquin Phoenix made me believe that he WAS the Joker himself which is actually insane.
456,"Joaquin Phoenix transform to the joker
Best actor in 2019Amazing ending and no stupid girl clown to ruined the movie hope for joker 2"
457,Do I have to say more? It's everything I thought it would be. This is tye jest movie of 2019.
458,"Joker. Where do I even begin. Never expected a comic book movie to talk about such serious issues that we face today in the world. Mental illness, social economic disparity, social service funding being cut and how mental illness should be treated and what role we play in helping mentally ill people and how they're treated. The best part about Joker is that it never takes a position on these issues, all it does is show us what it's like and holds a mirror up. And that's it. It leaves so many things open ended for the audience to perceive. It's a dark, moody psychodrama which is elevated through Joaquin's performance, Lawrence sher's cinematography and Hildur guðnadóttir's haunting score. Tod Phillips also directed and wrote the film very well. The writing did drop in quality in some scenes during the third act which was one of my only flaws I had, but I'm not getting into spoilers. Watching Joker is a surreal, out of body experience. Some scenes for example the 'bathroom dance' is like being in a hypnotic trance where you don't even wanna blink while watching. And these are just my thoughts on the film, Either way, go watch joker. Support risky films like this that have something to say."
459,"I went in the movie expecting a basic/ straight forward origin story of the joker and how he would fit in the Gotham of this Universe. But I got something else, an experience like never before from a comic book film. After the first watch I couldn't grasp everything, but after watching it for the third time, there are so many things happening that you would not even think of are happening, or ask yourself are they even real? The more you watch this film the more it grows on you, makes you think about the reality. The movie doesn't end on a straight forward conclusion, but keeps the mystery intact, and is open to interpretation. My take on this one is that, this movie is not about the joker which we know from the comics and live action movies, but it's about a man who impregnated this chaos in Gotham which led to hundreds of followers from which the real joker was born who became the arch nemesis of the batman. Joker is not about who is behind the mask but about the chaos which still passes down and is beyond his death."
460,This joker Standalone movie is a Masterpiece and the acting of Joaquin Pheonix makes it Oscar Worthy. I think it would be unfair if this movie and Joaquin doesn't gets the oscar.
461,"Just saw the movie in a midnight premiere in our local and favorite movie theater, and all I can say is thank you! Thank you Mr. Phoenix for a truly awesome, lovable and emotional performance, thank you Mr. Phillips for your creativity and writing. When it comes to Batman and all of Gothams citizens in the movies I'm always pretty sceptic wether they'll be played and portrait right, but when Mr. Phoenix was announced as the next Joker I knew there was no need to worry, then came the first teasers and trailers and my hope grew bigger, and now all I can say is thank you!!"
462,I'm sure lots of people worked really hard on this film. I found it slow and boring to say the least. The acting was great but the story didn't hold my attention.
463,Never have I ever sat 15 mins after the movie ended just thinking about what happened. This movie is a masterpiece of this decade. I don't think any other movie of this decade will top this.
464,As expected Joaquin Phoenix has done a fantastic job. Todd Phillips as director delivers a rounded film. The support from Director of photography and the music seals the deal.Story is a bit weak and lacks a punch that's expected from an iconic character as Joker. Joaquin's performance does cover up that but it's still pretty evident. Worth a watch
465,Very nice in my opinion it is the best story about the joker
466,"Joker is a beautifully crafted character study following a man called Arthur as he descends into madness following the events of what he describes as, ""a bad day"".Phillips has managed to create an entirely original and incredibly thought-provoking origin story that keeps some of the Joker's best comic book moments at its core, whilst also altering certain things that have very rarely been changed in the past such as turning Thomas Wayne into a rich snob that looks down on the working class rather than portraying him as a prestigious Doctor, as well as changing not only the Joker's colour scheme but also his face as well. I fell in love with this new rendition of the Joker and I couldn't think of any appearance that would better suit the title of 'The Clown Prince of Crime'. I'd even go as far to say that the Joker's look in this film is probably my favourite Joker look of all time.Initially, the thought of giving the Joker an origin story seemed strange to me, however upon watching the movie I realise that Phillips has been able to make this origin story as vague as possible; was the story itself a literal depiction of what we saw on the screen or was it another story that Arthur made up and told his psychiatrist whilst being locked up in Arkham State Hospital. It could be either, but in my mind, as much as I love the events of the film, I believe that the story of Arthur Fleck becoming Joker is just another story that Joker uses when he is asked about his past. This would then follow the idea explored in 'The Killing Joke' about Joker preferring his past to be, 'multiple choice'. Also, some events of the film are revealed to be delusions taking place in Arthur's mind, such as his relationship with Sophie, and his first appearance on the Murray Franklin Show, so what's not to say that the film itself is just one big delusion.Hopefully a sequel is on the cards, however I can also understand why they would want this film to be a solo flick. It's very rare that you would find a film as artsy and as well created as this to have a sequel. That being said, I do hope that Joaquin Phoenix returns to this role as I would love to see what he can achieve portraying the Joker for the length of a full film rather than just in the the third act."
467,"People are generally fascinated with what makes heroes and villains do what they do, whether it's real-life villains like Hitler or fictional characters like the Joker or Darth Vader. The first six episodes of Star Wars were all about the story of Darth Vader, how a little boy became the galaxy's ultimate villain, who terrorized and killed without mercy. So, thanks to ""Joker,"" we now understand how he became the evil character that he is. A key question, though is, when you step back from a movie, book, or any artistic creation, has it made the world better or worse? Really, that's a good question for any human endeavor. I think the first six episodes of Star Wars left the world better. Yes, we understood Vader; we understood how his circumstances and choices made him evil. Yet, when he became evil, he stayed evil; his violent acts were reviled. And, of course, ""SPOILER ALERT"", we were gratified by his redemption. 'Joker' doesn't do the same with the Joker. That's a problem, a big problem."
468,"Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?
Arthur FleckThat definitely feels true. Joker is set in the early 80s and is loosely based on the origin of the Joker (DC Comic character and arch rival of Batman). This version is written and directed by Todd Phillips (the director of The Hangover films...yep) and stars Joaquin Phoenix in the title role.Almost everyone has their opinion of the film and how they feel about it, so take what you can from them, but, this is what I thought of it.The Joker is a gritty hard hitting study of a man's decline into madness. Arthur Fleck is a lonely troubled man, who between caring for his ill mother and performing for kids as a clown, dreams of being a stand up comedian - his only problem, he isn't very funny.This sounds familiar and fans of Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese will recall King of Comedy (1982) and the painful Rupert Pupkin having the same dilemma (incidentally De Niro plays the chat show host Murray Franklin whom Arthur adores). Unfortunately Arthur or 'happy' as his mother calls him is living in a world that just doesn't understand him, again sound familiar? Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver (1976). Clearly these two films have influenced Phillips and he borrows seamlessly from them, but this is not in the same calibre as these, it stands alone.The central performance from Joaquin Phoenix delivers the punchlines (sorry). His lean skeleton holds the meat of the film (sorry again). He is mesmerising, he portrays sadness, depression, anger, loneliness and happiness brilliantly. It's a masterclass on acting, he lives and breathes the character.The supporting cast is good, Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz and Frances Conroy to name, watch out for Glenn Fleshler (Remus from Boardwalk Empire) and Brian Tyree Henry (Paper Boi from Atlanta).The music is standout, Icelandic Hildur Gudnadottir sets the right tone and style to the film (to be noted she did the music for this and Chernobyl at around the same time). There has been some subject of debate for one music choice and I don't why that particular piece of music was used when others could have been selected, perhaps Phillips was wanting the reaction? (jerk). The cinematography is good and adds grittiness to the screen, the makeup is good too, I like how Phoenix has adopted a different clown paint - slightly reminiscent of Doink the Clown from WWE though).The film is rated R so be prepared to see violence, however there are probably less deaths in here than in most of the Marvel films, yep, and when it happens you can feel the magnitude of it.I would still recommend seeing this (unless you have coulrophobia) and making your own mind up on how you feel about it, one thing is for certain you will be talking about it for some time, which is what Phillips probably wanted - 'send in the clowns...they are already here'."
469,"Joaquin""s performance was over the top perfection. Want 2 C it again for things I missed!
OSCAR...absolutely! Amazing!"
470,"I will never listen or read to critics. For the first time in my life, I didnt want a movie to end. Time was not enough, I wanted to see more of the Joker."
471,"A true tragedy that shocks at every turn. Watching a broken man fall further into brokenness and eventually madness. Phoenix gives an unforgettable performance that brings the Joker character to life in a visceral and gut punching way. Along with a horrifying score and beautiful cinematography, Joker is one of this years must watches."
472,"Ok, nobody can beat Heith Ledger.. But Joaquin Phoenix does the Joker extremely well. I've been waiting for a movie, dark and serious as the Dark knight. I've been longing for a movie that isn't like all the marvel comedies, a movie that feels real.The Joker is effectively shot, the story is perfect and the acting is genius.What I like most is that the Joker is still a mystery, Todd Phillips did not destroy the character. He developed him.The movie is obscure but still so clear, this is one of the best movies made.
The fact that people are worried about mass shootings just strengthen the fact that the movie is exceptionally well made. (of course it does NOT promote violence, it just shows how dark violence in fact is, unlike for example Deadpool.)
If I wasn't clear enough, see the movie, yesterday."
473,"The masterpiece behind Joker is multifaceted, which is exactly why it is a masterpiece. It has flawless acting, perfect directing and real, gritty revelations of real life. If anyone thinks this movie is bad because it suggests we should feel empathy towards Arthur despite his evil actions, they are part of the system which caused this trouble in the first place. Mental health does not exist in a vacuum; it is interrelated with a society and a system which does not care for people with disadvantage. Crimes rates soar and the community demands protection and justice; justice is served by detention and alienation. The cycle repeats itself until society is tricked to believing that there is a singular person to blame, but the imperfections of the system and lack of support from society is creating more Jokers than one movie discussing its subject matter. For this reason, Joker is bold, novel and technically perfect, it is a movie for the Ages, akin to that of There Will be Blood and Taxi Driver. It is a character study like no other!"
474,"This movie is as dark and morbid as they come. Don't expect this film to have anything to do with Batman or even the joker. They could've just made a film about a random person that struggles with mental health issues and it would've been a winner. Yes, it's a film about how the Joker came to be but for me, it was more than that. There's a much darker yet relatable story that it tells. It's almost a documentary about the very real illness that MANY of us face but are too scared to reveal until breaking point. The addition of the Joker, well, that's just a bonus. It's not often that a film can make you sympathise with the villain especially after some of the gruesome acts he does, yet, somehow by the end, you can't help but be on his side which actually makes you feel a little uncomfortable after the movies over. Brilliant film, incredible acting and certainly plays on your mind for a while after."
475,"Growing up I've seen all the iterations of the Joker character. From small screen to big screen. All of them are unique in their own way. Don't compare Phoenix to Ledger as the two Jokers are simply two different interpretations of the same concept. This is the story of the Joker from the inside out. There are no punchlines, no gimmicks and no silver lining. There is no hero in this film. This is a study on the concept of the Joker and how he became who he is. This movie is dark, terrifying, introspective and raw. Phoenix simply disappears in his role and you never wonder where he went. Everyone knows that the Joker is insane but never have we ever seen inside his mind like we do here. From top to bottom this film is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Phoenix has already won the best actor Oscar. It's just a matter of time before they hand it to him."
476,"Why can't the producers of Batman movies make it as good as this movie? Like it was on Dark Knight. DC should learn from the success of this move. Stop tryin to be like Marvel, have your own style, dark, gloomy and thrilling."
477,"This movie is an intense dive into our dysfunctional societies that has taken a turn for the worse.
To think the director behind such absurd film like Due Date and Hangover (Not that anything is wrong with those films) would even be willing to make this film in itself is amazing.
Joker puts our ugly side under the spotlight and makes you wonder where does a society draw the line.
Those that have watched the Swedish film The Square know that this is a concept that many film makers have worked on for so many years.
Joker is just the darkest side of this story and question.
this line the I am talking about is not the line of justifying the character of Joker but the line that eventually leads to making a person like Joker come to life.
This movie constantly paints that picture, where is the line?
Where do you put a stop to it?
How could you have prevented this from happening?
The movie opens with a clearly already broken man prisoner to the society and the system that is not willing or able to help him.
Joker's situation is already beyond dire and further down the line you learn about all the happenings that lead to this broken man.
The film maker and the actor never paint a heroic picture of Joker, he is not glorified by the movie.
He is presented as the byproduct of a society that is eerily familiar.
Because whether we like it or not we all are responsible for one another.
We all affect each other's lives in ways that we can never imagine and psychological health is to this day a subject that is scoffed at even by the brightest and most free thinking people.
No one likes to see where the monster comes from because we do not want to have the blaming finger turned on us.
We just want the monster among us shunned, chained and caged and hanged.
It is a fact that our failing societal relationships are leading to psychological illnesses and in extreme cases to violent outbursts.
Most of these outbursts are introvert and almost nobody pays any attention to them but the extrovert ones are always scoffed at when doctors talk about the need to study and understand them.
This is the world that creates Joker which is portrayed and criticized here.
Leaving that subject behind lets talk about Joaquin Phoenix.
This man is a wonder.
I have followed his work through out the years watching him as he evolved with every movie he played and today when you watch Joaquin play Joker you see him through out his career.
You see him in Gladiator, you see him in Ladder 49, you see him in Her.
He has grown with every movie to the point where he creates this amazingly authentic performance for the audience to take part in.
From the very first line, the mimicry, the slightest movement he is the character that he is portraying and he is Joker by the end of the movie.
You can hear this pained and sick man, you can see his break point, you can feel his struggles and that makes this performance just exceptional.
I am not going to even compare this performance, it really is an entirely different beast and by far one of the best performances I have seen in the recent years and easily the best Joker performance to this day.
Lets go into the music...what can be said except intense?
Something that I loved was the music choices, they really did convey the world's personality to me as audience.
From the jazzy tones of the New York city life (as we know Gotham is basically New York and Chicago mixed into an unholy union) to the musics chosen to deliver the mood of the scene or character it felt really fitting and good.
Then we come to the original sound track and we are basically dealing with a drama horror or thriller soundtrack with suspenseful moments and intense moments that makes you sit straight in wait for the impending explosion of events.
This is Joker, every camera shot, every movement and every sound is there to make you wait for the right moment that it goes ""BANG"" and puts something new on your lap and this movie has several of those.
This is Joker, a movie that studies what elements in a society can lead to the creation of people like Joker and Batman and in my humble opinion this movie delivered on this at every front possible.
I wholeheartedly recommend watching this movie to anyone that is a fan of Cinema and good films in general."
478,"Oscar for Joaquin !! Such an epic movie, Joaquin is truly Joker"
479,"Everything about this movie is perfect,if Joaquin Phoenix won t win the oscar I will stop watching movies."
480,ANYONE THAT TELLS YOU THAT THIS FILM IS ULTRA-VIOLENT OR PROMOTES GUN VIOLENCE IS LYING TO YOU.Amazing film. MASTERPIECE. A slow simmer to a rapid boiling over the pot great piece of story telling.
481,"One of the finest movies ever made.
Best acting performance ever.
Best story telling ever."
482,"Holy hell this turned out to be a good movie. Really enjoyed it in the theaters. One of the few comic movies where you actually start feeling something for the main character. The empathy is born from the good writing and the phenomenal performance of Joaquin Phoenix.The only thing mildly bad stuff about the movie -which isnt an issue about the movie- are the trailers. Dc did it again with the ""lets expose almost every scene in the movie with trailers"" mindset. Dont get me wrong the first teaser with the ""Smile"" piece was really cool and got me hyped for the movie. But it felt like I kinda knew what was gonna happen already. I dont mean the whole scenes itself but where Arthur is gonna in the next scene and stuff.Even if the trailer kinda ruined my first watch I whole heartedly recommend this movie to everyone."
483,"This is an origin story of a famous superhero villain, and not quite. You don't need to have extensive knowledge on all the lore of DC supers because Joker is a fresh new take on the very popular character. It is a film with an anti-hero protagonist, and an anti-superhero in terms of its overall tone. I must say, it is storytelling at its finest."
484,This was a wonderful study of the what could be behind the Joker. It is also a great commentary on our society and times and how the Media and the 1% create all of the problems that the rest of us are expected to deal with. Thomas Wayne is a great representation of the elite political class and how they think they know what is best for everyone.
485,"Very good movie. The first half of the movie was slow, but second half was amazing"
486,"Such an incredible reimagining of a fan favorite classic supervillain. This movie is set in the 80s but consistently feels like present times, which is a triumph in itself. Joaquin Phoenix again cements his immense range and talent as he completely absorbs the audience with his commitment to the character. Director Todd Phillips also proves once and for all that he too has a wide range of talent as a director and can take his films to the next level.
Astonishingly beautiful score writtenCompletly grasping and thrilling plotThought provoking message about mental health and the underprivileged in this country.10/10 Would Highly Reccomend"
487,"Phoenix fitted so we'll in his role as The Joker, reminded me of Health Ledger."
488,Joachim Phoenix is the best. how can someone act so good. just speechless.
489,It is so cringe to see people saying this movie is a masterpiece. It was so horribly depressing and twisted I can't believe people find it entertaining. Terrible film.
490,"This is a brilliant film helmed by Todd Philips with an Oscar worthy turn by Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker. This movie is more ""class"" than ""mass"". This is a very unique take on the character, very different from the Dark Knight's Joker that was played so awesomely by The late Heath Ledger. The film stays with you long after the end credits roll. I would like to add that it would be unfair & unnecessary to compare Joaquin's Joker with Ledger's Joker, since the same character is written differently in both films, and both these brilliant actors succeed in leaving their own unique impression on the viewer. And yes, the violence in this film has been totally overhyped some of the media outlets, the film is more a character study/drama with only a few scenes of violence that have been placed in sync with the story. Those expecting an ""action"" film, are likely to be disappointed.
Though this movie was planned as a standalone, I hope the success of this film inspires a Sequel.
My rating: 10/10"
491,"One of the most brilliant acting performances I have seen this year. Joaquin makes sure every eye is turned squarely on him, whether in the story or in the theater. You find yourself empathizing with Anthony in the first third, with the world against him, being kicked by young boys in the very first sequence, to losing his job. He's a nobody, and you feel for him. This starts to unravel in the next third, where you're struggling to find justification for why you sympathized with him, and the last part hits you hard, making a fool out of you for trying to justify a violent dangerous man's actions.
Joker is a masterpiece, carefully balancing Anthony's everyday actions with an almost eerie background score warning you of potential danger that lies ahead. It shows the destruction of a man into a new entity, who is remorseless, broken, dangerous and unpredictable- the Joker.
I loved the portrayal of Thomas Wayne as a typical rich businessman, and not the hero we're led to believe with the previous films, was brilliant, because the movie is from the point of view of a lonely lowly man like Anthony. I also loved the interaction between Bruce Wayne and Anthony, you could see the hunger and jealousy and the resentment in the eyes of Anthony when he talked to Bruce, believing that Bruce's life could have been his.
I love the parallel of showing how Bruce's innocent life ended with his parent's lives, and at the same time, Anthony's life too ended, in a way, by him fully accepting the Joker persona.
The movie is one of the best there is, without the use of CGI, without it being 3D, it's just a trodden man's descent into madness that is shown masterfully. Superhero/Origin Story fatigued? This breaks the shackles.
PS. Joaquin has played the Joker better than Heath Ledger, and this is the highest compliment I can give him."
492,"Joker didnt have any of the clever banter that we have come to know and love from one of the most well known Villians in history. The pace of this movie was totally off and basically a snooze fest for the first 40 minutes. Joaquin plays a great crazy person, but this origin story doesent give him enough leeway to truly do this movie justice. Some of the mannerisms were spot on, but the demeanor and intelligence level if the villain himself totally capsized any Hope's of enjoying this. The killings were bland and did not bring any desperately needed artistic element to the film. Towards the end, the connection made between the death of one and the rebirth of another was probably the smartest scene, and simply not worth waiting until the end to see. I left the theater in total confusion and dissappointment."
493,Ive only seen a few batman movies so i decided to go watch joker and since joaquin was the leading actor i thought it would be decent. i was impressed with the movie completely from the narrative to the soundtrack to the ending. and acting from joaquin was phenomenal deserves a OSCAR hands down!!! best performance ive seen in years since decaprio and the revenant. its so good im going next weeknd and watch it again...i havent done that since well ive never done that before. 10/10 movie i couldnt find a flaw in his acting role
494,"I'm not usually a fan of comic based movies. I was never a fan of batman because I'm having a hard time taking people in costumes seriously. I went to watch joker because all of the hype and I was genuinely expecting it to be a so-so performance. I went there watching the Heath Ledger's joker before, which was OK in my opinion, as I said, I'm not a batman movies fan.
However.
This movie is not about batman, is not about comics, is not about superheros. This is a drama film. A drama which touches you deep inside on a special level, a movie which you feel because at least once you will sympathize with the joker. You will find yourself debating inside, whether he should be excused for his actions. Seeing Phoenix portray Arthur, from a beaten man, to become THE joker, quite by accident, is an extraordinary journey. The movie deserves all the praise it gets, and some.
I can't recommend the movie enough, as it's just THAT good."
495,"No need for Deniro's name in ads. Phoenix IS the show. I am angry at so many negative reviews focusing on ""the violence"". Can't this just be a story? Does it have to teach some lesson? Does this have to include a discussion about mental health? Can't this just be a ""making of story"" about the most iconic villian in any comic universe? In the last 15 min when Arthur ""becomes"" , I found myself raising my arms, yes! As i walked out, I felt like i wanted to drive home at 90 mph! I loved this movie. I loved this film. I loved the director. I loved Joaquin. I didn't want to join any cause. I don't want to change my life. But days later, I am still amazed what a great movie this was!"
496,"It's beyond me why so many critics have panned and even encouraged people to skip this picture. I'm not exactly sure of why the vendetta's so personal; it's obviously struck a nerve . I'm taking critics less and less seriously since they rave about tripe like 'Lady Bird"" while trying to bludgeon a masterpiece like 'Joker'. This is the first ten I recall ever giving to a movie."
497,The best film I've seen in a long time! Absolute amazing!!! Definitely recommend to go & see it! Would definitely go & see it again!
498,My expectations for this movie weren't very high (DC just has been lacking lately) but man this movie is a masterpiece that has to been seen by all.
499,Is anything real or is nothing real... as he descends into madness he has more and more intense psychotic visions... is any of it real? Or is everything just the inside of a psychopaths mind... I don't think any amount of deciphering of this movie will be able to understand it. Thats why it is possibly the greatest movie ever made. 10/10 is a low score... ha.. ha hahahah
500,"Since Joaquin Phoenix was announced to play the Joker, i was on the front of the hype train and usually that leads to disappointment, but NOT this time!
This movie has such a gritty and realistic attitude towards it that my girlfriend (who has no clue about comics or Batman but i dragged her along into this!) asked me if this was based on a true story.Yes, the similarities to Taxi Driver, Fight Club and The King Of Comedy are obvious, but that doesn't hurt the movie at all. Some things you might see coming, which i usually hate, but this movie manages to leave more questions open, that it answers, so the enjoyment doesnt end when the movie finishes, you can debate about your theories for hours.I keep my reviews always spoiler free, I just wanna mention that I see what you tried here Todd Phillips, this movie is its own sequel - watch it and you'll understandA lovely character study and instant classic that will never get old. 11 years after Heath Ledger, this might be the next Joker that walks away with the little golden man, at least a nomination seems guaranteed!I can't stress enough how much i enjoyed that approach and would love to see more of these kind of movies, because this is what a comic adaptation really deserves."
501,I don't need to elaborate more - A masterpiece performance to the highest order. This is psychologically revolutionary portrayal of a deranged character.
502,"Sadly I can't give it a 10/10. But nothing is perfect.
Insane performance of the protagonist. At the end of the movie the massage is clear. The sequel is already made by Nolan. That some only want to see the world burn...when punched in the right direction. It gives meaning to the ""dark knight"". Ignorance and hate creates destruction. Most of the time it takes generation(s) to take form.
One of better movies from hollywood yet."
503,"The film consists of a unique combination between action and more in-depth themes such as how we treat vulnerable people in today's society. I find the entite movie very aesthetic regarding everything from how the scenes are taken to the costumes. Watching the movie I almlost got scared of the character at the beginning, due to the awesome character development my fear later turned into some sort curiosty about what his actions would result in. I think the in-depth themes explored in the movie might be relateable for lots of people who feel for example lonely or misunderstood. Joaquin Phoenix performance as the Joker really deserves an oscar."
504,The history of Joker is just so dark and beautiful at the same time. Joaquin Phoenix acting makes you feel the same emotions as his character
505,Truly brilliant movie with an outstanding performance from Pheonix
506,One of the best movie ever go and watch and review there
507,"The movie is about a man that wants to be a comedian, he works in a small company of clowns and he is a clown. The man has a mental problem so he has a lot of events that make his anger grow.
The film is a very good adaptation of the comic very well, the plot is amazing, also makes you identify with the villain.
The movie is amazing!"
508,"A pretty good movie; not quite the masterpiece that some would have you believe, it's too derivative for that, but it's still worth a watch and there's no denying that Joaquin Phoenix delivers an excellent performance in the title role. My main bone of contention with this film is that it really doesn't need to be tied up to the whole superhero genre, setting up the rivalry with Batman for at least half the running time; it's a better film than that and would have served better as a stand-alone psychological portrait of mental breakdown. Films this seems to have been inspired by include THE MECHANIC, THE KING OF COMEDY and of course TAXI DRIVER."
509,"It's dark and gritty, anarchistic and nasty, chaotic and filthy.
Joker deals with many thematically disturbing elements - mental health, political violence, and an ""incel""-like protagonist."
510,"A real fan of the joker karakter. Only in the batman movie with Jack nickerson. And now this one, and it feels all so reall, sadly. The world is going crazy, even more now with de C virus. And I think it will get worse and worse and then...... but great movie and great acting."
511,Displays mental health in a way anyone can understand while maintaining an entertaining movie
512,Joaquin is brilliant. He makes makes The Joker a real human being. He even makes you sympathize with him at times. The film is a masterpiece of film making. Thank you.
513,Joaquin's performance in this and the scenography is simply unmatchable. I highly recommend for everyone to watch it.
514,"Joker is not the epic comic book action spectacle I was expecting, but so much more. It is a deep, well written and masterfully shot character study that is moving, chilling and disturbing. Its deep themes ask questions about issues in society and mental health, and it's haunting soundtrack will stay in your head for a long time. This is all ropes of with the central performance by Joaquin Phoenix, which is one of the greatest performances in the history of cinema."
515,"I find everything about this movie perfect, I honestly went in expecting it to be a 7 or 8 out of ten movie at best, because sometimes movies that get this much hype don't actually live up to it, but I can assure you that this one certainly does.I always had a huge love for Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker (May he rest in peace) but honestly, for me, this one certainly takes the cake. Joaquin Phoenix embodies The Joker to a T in this film, I can't help but absolutely root for The Joker even though he might actually be mentally insane (although I've always had a love for good villains so that explains why, but I mean who doesn't). Anyway I thoroughly enjoyed it and will definitely be rewatching it lots throughout the years (hopefully). 10/10-IGN"
516,I'm not gonna day much because no matter what i'm gonna say about this movie and performance of joaquin phoenix ... it wouldn't be enough - But all i can say is that it's Joaquin most outstanding role Ever made
517,"Great cinematic experience. With a breathtaking, nostalgic, story. About real life and its dark realities. All taking place in a comic world. A great contrast between fantasy and reality. Joker is portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix. And is scary and beautiful in a compelling way.Hope to see a Joker part 2. I think there is more to the story. And I hope that Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix will continue their work together."
518,"Brilliantly written, this movie is not what you would expect. Humanizing someone so evil isn't easy, but Joaquin makes it look effortless. The violence is excessive, but so is our anti- hero."
519,"After being a bit disappointed by DC and Warner Brother's movie offerings since The Dark Knight, Joker is a film that gave me faith in the possibility of Hollywood doing these characters justice again.Todd Phillips has created a film that not only entertains and surprises, but is also a feature that grips you and stays with you. From the 70s New York style Gotham to the completely believable beginning, Joker starts so unexpectedly - it makes you feel genuinely sorry for Phoenix's Arthur Fleck.Ravaged by mental health issues and given a tough deal in life from the get-go, Arthur is odd, likeable and clearly troubled. As the movie unfolds, there are twists and turns that retain Arthur as an enigma, but his bizarre appeal doesn't go anywhere.It's a tragic tale, and it is through the device of tragedy, the viewer truly cares for Arthur. Even as events take place that make you doubt if Arthur is as innocent as he seems, you still feel drawn to the character: a testament to Phoenix's performance.This film resonates on many levels - and without giving anything away, one can't help but see what Joker depicts coming true. It really is getting crazier out there.This isn't just a great film - it's one of the best character pieces ever made. A must watch for anyone - not just comic book fans."
520,"An incredibly dark and thought provoking psychological thriller focusing on the joker and his slow descent into madness. This movie deserves a 9 for Phoenix's acting alone. He was absolutely brilliant as the joker, giving the most chilling and unsettling performance I have ever seen. His manic laughing throughout was truly anxiety-inducing. The movie focuses primarily on the jokers personal life, along with his mental health issues and his inability to be accepted by the others. We see the film through the eyes of the joker and experience the pain and anguish that he feels, so naturally yet bizarrely we sympathise with him. He is not portrayed as any hero, but just a very mentally ill man who has been let down by society and pushed into becoming his darker more psychopathic alter-ego. I love how the film provides social and political commentary on the problems of society, exposing the fakes for who they are, and the unfair system of rich vs poor. The joker represents a man given up on by society, albeit told in a much more psychologically harrowing and dark way. The film had many elements of shock and sudden turn of events, making the jokers character even more unpredictable and terrifying, and overall producing an uncertain and tense atmosphere as he became more and more insane, jumping back and forth between the joker, and his normal self. The music was perfect for every scene, with some excellent choices for songs, emphasising the fun and excitement in some scenes, and the despair and panic in others. I love it when a film leaves you just as exhausted, confused and drained as the main character, conveying that it's gripped you entirely, which is exactly what this film does. It never gets tiresome, as Phoenix steals every scene he's in, and you can't help but feel perplexed and bewildered by his actions, not knowing whether to feel bad for him or not. The films universal themes of feeling disliked and different to society is a thing we can all relate to, and fortunately the film depicts the joker as one of the many victims of this cruel prejudice. I loved the films dry and slightly unsettling atmosphere in certain scenes e.g. When the joker did something bad, happy music would start playing ; it takes you on an emotional rollercoaster and makes you think that you're going mad yourself. Overall, this is a very dark but intriguing look at the jokers descent into a criminal, and the unfair circumstances that's led him to this. You don't have to be a fan of the superhero comics to enjoy this. It's twisted, shocking, but most of all a fun and incredible watch. Highly recommend!"
521,"The Joker tells of the early days of the eponymous arch-enemy of Batman (Joaquín Phenix, over the top, btw that´s a compliment) and why he turned out the way he did, somewhat like Maleficent (Robert Stromberg, 2014, btw there´s a sequel on the way) did for the eponymous wicked fairy-godmother. The Joker´s problem, or at least the main of many, is that he suffers from a mental condition that causes him to laugh hysterically and uncontrollably when faced with stress, which, compounded by a discontinuation of the respective psychotropic medication due to social security cuts (the film is set at a time when Reaganomics was spreading misery across that iconic mix of the Big Apple and the Windy City: Gotham), leads to a chain of predictably irreversible adverse events.Appropriately released by Warner Brothers, a studio which from the 1930s on championed the thesis of the criminal as victim of society in many a seminal gangster and orphanage movie, The Joker arguably inaugurates the psycho thriller/social drama genre - although with a possibly unconscious nod to White Heat (Raoul Walsh, 1949) - and does it in an unusually unvarnished way, at least for the standards of a major Hollywood production, sporting impeccable late 70s/early80s period detail which only close to the end we manage to date precisely, as the Joker walks by a movie theatre showing Blow Out (Brian de Palma): 1981, long after the creation of the comic character but before the start of the current Batman film franchise, when the Joker made his first appearance, impersonated by Jack Nicholson, in 1989.The best and most succinct praise for The Joker that occurs is that its viewing substitutes without loss the reading of the abundant literature available on identity politics (including the very recent Identity, by Francis Fukuyama, btw brilliant diagnosis but lame prognosis, but I´ll let you be the judge of that). On the other hand, you may never like Batman again."
522,"Out of every movie I have seen, ""Joker"" has got to be the darkest and most expressive. It tells an uncommon story that will most certainly keep you watching gladly until the very end. I know I was very anxious to finally watch it, having waited months. After seeing it, I realized that it was not quite what I was expecting, it was better. You don't usually see many movies that are as original and meaningful as ""Joker"", seeing that they can be very hard to come by at this time. Nowadays, movies are composed of mostly remakes and lots of CGI. But, if you watch ""Joker"", you will find an extraordinary story with lots and lots of talent from it's incredible actors. I was extremely impressed with Joaquin Phoenix's interpretation of Joker and I am fairly certain that Heath Ledger would be as well. It is unbelievable how talented a person can be at acting. I can understand how one might feel if they were in a similar situation to Joker and I am sure others do as well. Sometimes, I just wish that people could be more respectful and kind to one another. I think that this movie does a great job highlighting that. All in all, this is an incredible movie, which I think most would enjoy watching. I know I did."
523,"Oaquin's role as the joker was excellent!
The rest of the movie, I didn't think it was so bad"
524,"It appears that Joker is a polarizing film, with those disliking it stating it bears no resemblance to its source material, and those who welcome it viewing it as a commentary on society at large. I believe that Joker's widespread success may be a testament to the current widespread decay, which is becoming more and more evident.The film portrays Arthur Fleck, beginning as he roams the squalid city in the midst of martial law, as those tasked with collecting garbage are on strike. The state of the city is symbolic of the state in our heads. We see that everyone in the film is solipsistic, working only to the degree that is commensurate with their salary, no more and no less. Instead of banding together as a society to clean the city, they continue to justify their narcissism and ask for others to clean the city (if others won't do their job, why should I?).Arthur's job is to make people laugh and to entertain. This is symbolic of the clown world we live in, where attention is becoming a commodity. In order to achieve a certain threshold of success, you need to be able to entertain, thus being able to provide this commodity. At work, we entertain in order to get ahead. At home, we give ourselves an IV of narcissistic supply in the form of social media, where we receive the attention.The sign that Arthur carries with him has a subtext, which implies that society, at large, must be eradicated. The squalid nature of the city, a function of the inhabitants within it, are the source of this darkness. Arthur's attempts at bringing attention to himself represents the pathological narcissism that permeates the world today. ""I hope my death has more meaning than my life,"" implying that he is unable to get the attention he believes he desires while he's alive, so perhaps people will finally notice him when he dies. His fantasies about being applauded and welcomed further reinforce this idea. This narcissism breeds from a lack of attention in childhood, which is unsurprising given Arthur's dysfunctional upbringing. The reason Arthur said he felt more comfortable in a mental asylum is because the environment confers the maternal warmth that he lacks. There, he has no need to associate with anyone, compromise, or come to any agreements, he receives maternal warmth from the social workers, and is given sustenance.The stairs throughout the film are symbolic of the difficulty to elevate one's social and spiritual status. It is always harder to climb up (strive towards virtue) than it is to come down (succumb to dissolution). Arthur is consistently shown as having a hard time climbing the stairs; yet when he becomes Joker, he climbs down effortlessly, symbolizing the ease of succumbing to temptation-the path of least resistance.Living with his mother provides Arthur with comfort and safety. The mother figure represents the individual. The need to leave one's mother represents the need to elevate ones biological and emotional needs in favor of the self. In other words, leaving the comforts of home forces one to grow, something that Arthur does not wish to do. With that, the audience sees that taking care of his mother symbolizes the importance that society places on the material, disregarding spiritual growth (moving out). The need to take care of his mother is symbolic of that need to nurture consumerism. When his mother tells Arthur that he should smile more, this reinforces this idea, because those who are able to entertain are able to achieve success, and therefore obtain material prosperity.Murray Franklin is Arthur's father-figure. Arthur's fantasies have him receiving attention from the audience, and warmth and acceptance from Franklin. This represents the non-existent father presence that many children experience today, as they are products of divorced or dysfunctional families. When Randal gives Arthur a gun so he can defend himself, he calls him ""my little boy."" This accentuates Arthur's infantile nature, and represents manhood. It's noticeable how Arthur does not go out and purchase a gun (dormant or non-existent masculinity), but receives it from someone else. This represents how men in society are lacking the father role in their lives, instead receiving it from morally questionable outside influence (media). As Arthur receives the gun, a symbol of masculinity, from someone who wasn't his father (didn't teach Arthur how to be a man), he is unable to harness his masculinity for good, and instead uses it for destruction.Once again, the audience sees Arthur laboriously climb up the stairs. At home, Arthur begins playing with his gun, and suddenly feels an awakened sense of strength in the form of the warrior and lover. He is confidant he can strike a conversation with his neighbor, and even seduce her so that she will love him. It is noticeable how Sophia is single. Arthur feels he will be able to relate to her because he has been caring for his mother, who is also single. After Arthur is fired, he is seen on a train. The train is symbolic of a lack of agency, as it has a predetermined path. This tells us that Arthur's transformation into Joker is not his fault, occurring without his influence. He has not chosen the path of Joker, it has been decided for him. Furthermore, the train is shown underground, symbolizing the dark pit of his soul. This is reinforced by killing the men who taunted him on the train. As Arthur dances in front of the mirror, we see he is no longer Arthur, but is now Joker. Each time Arthur contorts his body is also the transitional point from Arthur to Joker. He feels an awakened masculinity, fantasizing about having sex with his neighbor. After he retrieves his things from work, we see the ease in which he descends down the stairs, symbolizing his chosen path towards moral depravity.As Arthur finds out about Wayne, he goes to visit him. As he tells him how he really feels, what the audience is seeing is the confession of a soul, the product of contemporary civilization. Wayne represents this society, and instead of comforting Arthur, punches him in the face. This symbolizes society's disregard towards those like Arthur, believing that it is their weakness and ineptitude that made them who they are. They extol the virtues of agency and dismiss the element of luck that is highly correlated with their success. The audience then sees that Wayne, the symbol of Capitalism, and Penny, the symbol of consumerism, are the two forces that breed those like Joker, who exist without an identity and purpose. When Arthur returns home, he goes inside his refrigerator. This symbolizes that Arthur is now dead, and in his wake, is Joker.Joker takes on his newfound identity of moral corruption, and chaos ensues outside, indicating that a world without a virtuous codex of beliefs, is a world destined to disarray. He is the post non-classical hero, who exists for his subjective self-expression, disregarding rules and causing chaos.The large acclaim the film received is a testament to the fact that many in society see themselves as Joker, disenfranchised and without a purpose. Joker is a symptom of the disease."
525,"I gave this film 7/10 because I think Joaquin Phoenix is one of the best actors in Hollywood. However, I don't get the hype about the ""message"" conveyed. I have seen so many ""rebellion against the society"" movies that I wasn't surprised or impressed by anything presented in Joker, except for Phoenix's convincing acting. He presented a different take on the Joker character than his predecessors, so I suppose it's noteworthy. Otherwise nothing ""incredible"" about the content of the film really. Also, I don't understand the ""profound depth"" of the musical score - why all of the awards?... Morricone, Williams, Rota and so many other greats weren't recognized nearly as quickly in their lifetimes, honestly.. And this slow cello theme is put on the pedestal, like some instant classic? Seriously???..."
526,A great performance a little too dark times if you can handle it. Overall I enjoyed but I did not love it.
527,"I love how this movie became a massive hit popularly, a huge success financially, won two Oscars and a big sack of other awards and nominations, and yet scored 59/100 with the critics. Tells you a lot about critics nowadays, doesn't it?"
528,"Joker Story: The origin tale of the Joker (Joaquin Phoenix) - one of the most iconic villains in comic book history. I'm not quite sure where the Joker goes from sympathetic to not in my mind, but it happens somewhat imperceptibly as the film goes by. I enjoyed watching it, and am glad I did so. But that said the hype from some quarters about this seems a bit over the top to me. Somewhat above average but it's not going to blow your socks off or anything. If Joaquin Phoenix finally wins an Academy Award for this performance, it will be hard to argue against it. Disturbing and intense, yet undeniably brilliant, this may very well become the definitive origin tale of the Joker."
529,It was a Great movie honestly I don't know how Captain Marvel was rated higher than this movie To be honest this is one of the best movies I've ever seen you really get to connect with the character and you feel sympathetic for him and that's one of the things that really makes this movie Joaquin phoenix Was an amazing actor in this movie overall I give this movie a 9 out of 10
530,"I really like Joaquin Phoenix, especially the fact that we share the same syndrome :)"
531,"Full marks for plot rhythm sense, connotation thinking tension, art drama and character creation. It's wonderful"
532,"The movie is one that was disturbing but in a masterful and artistic way, we see the spiral and see it well, they dont let you forget this person had good intentions and lost it in his insanity"
533,"The clown who was praised by the whole network finally opened his eyes. The teacher said that the greater the expectation, the greater the disappointment.The clown in my impression is the representative of chaos and madness, and the structure of meaning - a sentence of why so series really asks people's mind.I don't remember who said that revolution, if it is only against oppression, is only human nature, but if it changes its own life, it is the awakening of thought. I think the clown is higher, he dispels all meanings. I think of clowns as a unique existence, which really has a unique significance. But in the film, there is only one painful person to vent. Maybe it's true, but I don't like it."
534,"Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you againThis was a journey into the land of insanity
I really enjoyed Joker's stroll into the realm of psychosis.Sanity is such a delicate, tentative, state of being, the Joker would know.
The problem with insanity is how incredibly sane it feels."
535,The acting was phenomenal but the movie was bad. I'd give it 5/5 acting and 2/5 storyline. Joaquin Phoenix deserved his Oscar.
536,"This is masterpiece one-man show. Joaquin Phoenix showed his best acting and I felt like he is really mad as the joker in the movie. His facial and body expressions, his crazy laugh, his crying, everything was like watching real pathological person. And this was everything integrated with dark, dramatic music. Outstanding cinema experience, was twice."
537,The hype was real and the movie was a modern masterpiece. Even though it feelt more as a movie about a man falling into madness that a Joker movie but nonetheless I can 100% recommend watching this movie for Joker fans or Joaquin Phoenix fans (who really challanged Heath Ledger in role of Joker but in other aspects that you think). In conclusion an amazing movie to watch.
538,"Really good movie! Music,script,foto, lightning literally almost everything fitted perfectly. They shoehorned the story into Gotham in a clever way, but even without that part it would still been great !!! Phoenix Performance was very unsettling , perfection!"
539,"The movie did a great job portraying the creation of the Joker in a relatable, and realistic way. It also helps highlight the importance of mental health and awareness."
540,"This is not a good ""clown"" movie, because it departs from the chaotic and unpredictable nature of the role of the clown, giving the clown a tragic but traceable cause. But this does not prevent the film from becoming a good movie. This is a crime film that is out of the superhero-like surrealism. Mind fucks the audience all the time, until the final climax. The unique performance of Jacques Phoenix gave this clown a tragic artistic personality full of contradictions and pain. I can already foresee him sweeping the awards season. Just like the crime classic ""Taxi Driver"", ""Clown"" is the only choice of this era."
541,"The movie was great! The performance was outstanding, and it was almost true to life of the current day."
542,"Really beyond expectations. I haven't seen DC Comics. The movie tells the story of the gap between the bottom edge of the society and the rich and the poor from the perspective of clowns. From rhythm to soundtrack to the depth of the story lines, it's very smooth and has a first-class texture. Jack Kun's acting is cracked again, skinny, but explosive."
543,"This tale of Joker's descent into madness has legitimate pathos. Joaquin Phoenix here is not charismatic, but sad and pathetic-not in the derogatory sense of the word, but in the sense of appearing skinny, having a cruel neurological condition, and being constantly misjudged, and in deserving pathos, or our sympathy. Sometimes, it did seem like this world of this newly created Joker struggled to fit with the comic book character we know from the Batman franchise. While Joker's slow burn into violent activity was believable, it was less believable that the same descent could lead him into becoming a super villain. Joaquin's Joker doesn't seem to have much agenda for the grand scale. His violent actions are all personal and reactive. This Joker falls into becoming a symbol for a protest movement, which doesn't feel quite a product of Gotham but of hasty scriptwriting. The film does its best to mix outcast themes, clown imagery and mental illness all in one to create the Joker, but something more than clown makeup is missing from the equation.""Joker"" is an uncomfortable and magnetic film. It uses several kinds of storytelling devices to disorient our sense of reality, sometimes successfully and other times not completely enough. Its use of soundtrack is compelling but also less than fully consistent. The era of the when the film occurs confuses itself between the 40s, the 60s, the 80s and the present 2000s. The soundtrack is pulled from a variety of these decades as well, and adds to that feeling of disorientation. The Batman franchise spans these decades, so gives meaning to their reference, but also warps the viewers frame of reference in assessing the important themes of the film. Is there a reason most of the social workers Alex Fleck/Joker encounters are black? Is this a statement of some kind, or a metaphor for projection, or just part of the demographic of the time?Anyway, not to overshadow the fact that this is a movie dealing with complex psychology of an unsettling but humane kind, and that this film that makes viewers uncomfortable somehow remarkably landed a wide audience and mass acclaim. Well, not remarkably. Any Batman movie would. But that this movie got made is quite a feat.While this movie isn't anything about incels (it's not a movie about perpetual virginity or anything 2000s, I think), it is probably the one movie most having to do with the fear of violence modern society has for those it has outcast. With this film I think it's possible to have more empathy than fear. However, there are some problematic messages that comes up by meshing together a story of an isolated, troubled, but rather ordinary person with a desire for simple joy, and that of a uniquely celebrated anarchist super-villain like Joker. These two characters don't quite relate, and perhaps shouldn't."
544,"Certainly it's difficult to disagree that Joaquin Phoenix gave an excellent performance of a seemingly real person suffering from real issues, but the story was slow-paced and entirely depressing."
545,"In a world completely oversaturated with superhero movies featuring aliens, magic rocks, and constant cheesy jokes and one-liners, in comes this film that portrays the downfall of a man who only meant to do good. He is pushed down and thrown out by an uncaring world and becomes a symbol of rebellion. At the end I wanted to weep for his dark but perversely triumphant fate. Watching this film is chilling and almost horrifying at time, and it is a work of art in its classic storytelling, beautiful cinematography, haunting score, believable dialogue and a fantastic performance by Joaquin Phoenix."
546,"""Every story needs its hero. And its villain. And its monster.""
The Caped Crusader of Gotham City was never complete without his villain, the Joker. What made The Dark Knight (2008) a phenomenal success at the box office and as an all time cult classic was the characterization of the agent of chaos and seamless delivery of witful dialogues and challenges. It wasn't a surprise that the people loved the Joker more than the Batman himself in the film, for he, the Joker, didn't have any rules to play by. It was unfortunate that Heath Ledger had to leave this world, and thus creating a permanent vacuum in the Gotham City. There had been attempts by Jared Leto to fulfill the gap, but it is no match.DC had to come up with a solo Joker movie that was due for long. Joaquin Phoenix had been creating the buzz ever since the first look poster arrived and looks-wise he was almost..almost matching the legend of Heath Ledger. With much expectations, the Joker is finally here.Set in 1981, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a disregarded personality who works as a clown at places wherever needed and lives with his mom Penny. With a rare neurological condition, he suffers from frequent and inopportune laughter which irks people around him. The city as such is infested with crime and unemployment all over, hence there is no question of sympathy or concern for special characters such as him. Struggling to make a mark as a stand up comedian, Arthur also suffers from delusions where he is unable to distinguish reality from dreams. Things go topsy-turvy when one of his colleagues hands him over a gun to take care of miscreants who harm him. Arthur uses it against 3 rogue employees of Wayne Enterprises. While the cops are in search for Arthur, he also is in constant battle to come up as a comedian, pursue his neighborhood crush, find out the true identity of his father and take care of his mom. When he finds an answer to most of these, how he handles them and emerges as the Gotham City rebellion is the plot.The movie has its high moments in the seamless change of expressions and body language of Joaquin. The audience will be in for a shock to see his shirtless episodes where he reminds one of Christian Bale from The Machinist (2004 The background score in most places takes the cue from The Dark Knight and builds over it to make us feel the connect. Also there are too many frames that resemble the ones of Heath Ledger, which possibly could be a deliberate attempt. ). For those expecting a Batman cameo in this movie - the answer is both YES and NO.While this movie could easily be a grandeur in performances, one cannot get the rush that was given by the one played by Heath Ledger. Surely, there cannot be a comparison to the 2008 Joker version, for that set its standards too high that any more attempts can only keep trying to scale up half way. We can only hope the sequel to this one has much more interesting elements, for the movie ends with enough scope for that hope!"
547,"Phenomenal movie, best I've seen in a long time, and stands next to The Dark Knight (The trilogy) not connected story wise, but connected atmospherically wise.Also please, SJWs and haters: don't write any more reviews. No one is reading them."
548,"I'm Going to start with this : One of the Top 10 best acting performances I've ever seen, Joaquin Phoenix Was Genius.
The Movie is Dark, unsettling, physically painful but in a good way.
haunting score, Great Soundtrack, Incredible directing and screenplay, the only problem I had with this film is the ending a small problem really, i felt that it needed something more.
Anyway this film will be talked about for years to come, i highly recommend it."
549,"All I saw before seeing this film was media hype. There was going to be violence, it should be banned, people are walking out. It glorifies disenfranchised ""white males"". Gutter trash news like CNN and the Guardian, MSNBC were spreading this vile divisive propaganda. Well have a think about this. Time Warner owns CNN, they also own Warner Bros who made this film. Is it OK to profiteer off peoples fears, to divide people in their countries against each other? Because Hollywood and the Mainstream Media are doing it. And I don't think we should be paying them a damn cent. Other than that garbage this was a great movie. It's not cookie cutter like most of the Marvel films, this movie is it's own monster and is well worth a watch. Lets just be a little more aware as to how unscrupulous Hollywood and lying Media Elites play ball. Don't trust them, don't listen to their virtue signalling just wake up."
550,"This Is So Much Fun Loviing Moviie ;) Cuot Classic , All Creadit Goes To Jaoquin Pheonix , And Joker Legacy Will Continue After This , And I Think Joker Made New Benchmarks In Movie Industry , And Joker Moviie Is Just Awesome , And The Last Scene Of The Movie Is Just So Epic ;)This Is So Much Fun Loviing Moviie ;) Cuot Classic , All Creadit Goes To Jaoquin Pheonix , And Joker Legacy Will Continue After This , And I Think Joker Made New Benchmarks In Movie Industry , And Joker Moviie Is Just Awesome , And The Last Scene Of The Movie Is Just So Epic ;)"
551,"What a movie, the Joker is now among my top 3 of all time. This will go down as a Classic Masterpiece."
552,Went to see joker in theater thinking the movie would be ok. Was shocked at how great the movie was and how outstanding of a performance Joaquin Phoenix did.
553,"It has been long since I get moved by a movie this much, I came back home sad I don't know why, still can't get over it. How many humans lived such rough childhood and then get rejected by society and then we blame them for being weird, it is really sad, people should think about each-other much more"
554,"It's somewhat fortuitous that I saw the pilot episode of that dreadful Batwoman TV show on the same day I saw Joker. The two seem such polar opposites - one is rabid intersectionalist propaganda clumsily shaped by a newly-menstruating 13-year old into something that is almost *entirely* unlike anything recognizable as an actual story, with actual characters and believable situations, dialogue and acting.The other is... well, something other than that - I'm not entirely sure what, but whatever that something is, it can't help but come as something of a relief.The trailers at the cinema were for Feminist Terminator, Feminist Star Wars and 'The Emancipation of Harley Quinn': all explicitly anti-male, openly and unapologetically attacking and tearing down men and masculinity - and at the same time still fully expecting to appeal to the great majority of action, sci-fi and superhero fans, who have always been male.In 2019 it's hard to be a man and go to the cinema or turn on the TV without being told you're obsolete, or 'toxic', or just the biggest problem facing the world today since cancer. In 2019, Joker is the only big film which doesn't do that, the only film which looks at a straight white man as first and foremost a fragile human being in need of love, care, protection and help. In 2019, this, apparently, is a terrible, dangerous, unforgiveable and revolutionary act.Ho hum.* * *So look, the film has its strengths and weaknesses:On the plus side there is, as everyone knows, Joaquin Phoenix's astonishing performance - one of the most gripping pieces of screen acting ever. His Joker is just every tortured, beaten, defeated soul wrapped up in a weak, paper-thin shell that is slowly tearing apart and open before our eyes. He does a great job of showing the effects of the 'double bind' - the strain of being constantly instructed to do (or not do) opposing, contradictory or sometimes impossible things, which can snap an overburdened mind and at least potentially play a role in bringing on schizophrenia. I noticed several deliberately placed moments illustrating this early on in the movie.Secondly, the gorgeous cinematography, on grainy celluloid immediately makes one feel one is watching a stone-cold classic movie from the very start. It feels very much like it could have been shot in 1982 by Martin Scorcese, and there are vigorous nods to both Taxi Driver and The King Of Comedy, as well as a bunch of other 70s crime films. I enjoyed that paying homage aspect of it very much.Thirdly, it is a gritty, realistic, serious and seriously made film - the like of which is rarely attempted today, and of course never as a superhero movie. This, though, is not entirely good news, which brings us to the minuses:The minuses are it's not a superhero movie of any kind. Grey-haired Joaquin seems a little too old for an origin story, and tone-wise, the only film that this could conceivably be a prequel to is The Dark Knight, and even that at a considerable stretch. I repeat for emphasis: Joker is not a superhero movie. Nothing extraordinary or fantastical happens that diverges from the ordinary wretched reality you can read about each day in the newspaper headlines. Because of that, it is quite a considerable downer, never really feels as though it leaves the ground, and eventually one does long for the days of Cesar Romero trapping Adam West in a huge yellow shoe or something.The more realistic you try to make a superhero comic book story, the less fantastical, and thereby enjoyable and entertaining the story will be. The single, solitary exception to this, the one film that captured lightning in a bottle, which DC have been catastrophically failing to repeat ever since, is The Dark Knight, and perhaps the greatest weakness of this present film is that it tries to take that realism even further, to a point where even the memory of the character the film is being based on in the first place is lost.In the final analysis, the whole thing just doesn't up to an awful lot, and without the fantastical superhero element the premise in retrospect seems a small and silly thing to base a film on. It feels much more like a biopic of an overly-bullied high school shooter in a clown mask, not a supervillain able to take on little Bruce Wayne all grown up in a batcopter. Phoenix's Joker is so debilitated and weak, with not one single strength or talent on display, it's impossible to imagine him surrounded by henchmen and weilding joke-shop weapons of mass destruction while strapping on a hi-tech utility belt.None of the other characters are fleshed out even a little, and no-one else's acting is in anything like the same league as the lead. Even though his King Of Comedy is an enormous influence on this film, every time Robert de Niro appears on the screen it just reminds us how he can't be bothered to act anymore, hasn't acted in decades, and now just turns up to collect the money. I have no real complaints about anyone else in the movie, but this is a one man show, and Joaquin Phoenix is the man.Politically, the film seems to have nothing to say and the constant nods in that direction are muddled and confused and seemingly just there for show. No ideas introduced are dealt with or resolved. It's a film of surfaces.For all this complaining, though, it's a shallow film that's still something of a must-see, for the mood, the look, the intensity, and Joaquin Phoenix's creepy ol' laugh."
555,"So i have seen it twice now with a heavy probability of going a few more if im being honest here.Its haunting, its brilliant, its tragic, its beautiful, its funny, its dark, its sad, its funny...its Joker.We have finally been blessed with every iteration of the joker their is. From the clown and the gangster, to the anarchist and the unhinged, but now we finally have the madman and the showman. Phoenix brought everything to this performance and with Phillips crafted a Joker thats elegant and chilling. Both times I have seen it I have walked away with more questions and more theories. But theres a grace in Phoenixs performance. A dance. He glides through these scenes
In a way i thought no actor would do with the joker. Its beautiful and painful and a pure expression of the soul. The bathroom scene alone...awestriking. (not a spoiler its in the trailer) Phoenix has done it folks. Ledger would be so proudI cant remember the last time i have seen a movie this good. Elements of the godfather, taxi driver, king of comedy, the killing joke, the dark knight/the dark knight returns, mark hamil, a clockwork orange, requiem for a dream, one flew over the cuckoos nest, psycho, silence of the lambs...the list goes on.The MUSIC and the cinematography are truly some of the best I had ever seen. You are left powerlessly mystified by Phoenix and Phillips dedication to the project.
Its a masterpiece in every sense of the word
Nothing in the last year or hell the last decade even TOUCHES how great this movie is...Its not for everybody thats for sure, its a stiff drink to swallow.I remember everybody being surprised when i said Endgame was not the comic book movie i was waiting for in 2019. I knew there was something special about this movie when i saw the screen test.
Never in my life would I think a movie like this would exist...but it does....and people are starting to notice..."
556,It's very good movie however the only mistake I see that the joker age shouldn't be that old as not have great age difference between Batman and the joker
557,Origin stories vary from either good to very bad and should be burned in fire. This one delivered on all fronts. It showed the progression that he went through from where he was to what he would become. It touched on his childhood and how that helped shape who he would be. Everything connected. It clicked as it should. It told a gritty and dark story. There were moments you're thinking why is this happening... just give it a couple of minutes and that reason is told. This Joker is one you want to watch. You almost want to root for him but then you remember he is the bad guy so while you don't root for him you understand him a lot better. Take a couple hours out of your day and enjoy this one. May even enjoy it a second time.
558,"You see, hear and feel this film like you rarely do any film."
559,"I'm literally speechless. I cannot describe this amazing masterpiece in any other words. It's just Brilliant. Joaquin Phoenix is a Talented Actor he DESERVES an Oscar for his Performance. The Story Amazing, The Theme amazing and The Score! Oh my goodness it sent chills down my spine ! All this crap going about encouraging Murder is all lies. Watch it yourself it's a Masterpiece."
560,"When this film was announced, my initial thought was ""no one can come close to rivaling Heath Ledger's legendary performance as the Joker in 'The Dark Knight'."" Let me tell you: Joaquin Phoenix give a phenomenal performance in ""Joker"" it'll be the biggest snub in Oscar history if he doesn't get nominated; he really dug deep for this one. As far as how it compares to Ledger's performance, it does, and it doesn't. It does because both will be talked about for years and will be considered some of the best performances in cinematic history that transcend any comic book movie portrayal by a long shot. Neither actor dialed in their performance; they each put the time and effort into making a unique interpretation of the character, which leads to the part where I mentioned that they don't compare because each version of the character are polar opposites of one another as far as their motives. Ledger's version was an agent of chaos; there was no reasoning behind his actions, he didn't have a clear backstory (it was multiple choice); he was just a guy that wanted to watch the world burn, and he portrayed that to perfection. Meanwhile, Phoenix's version, suffered from a mental illness all while being treated unfairly in life. We're taken through a series of tragic events through Arthur's perspective, that eventually push him over the edge and lead he to become the ""Clown Prince of Crime""; that was portrayed to perfection as well. Side Note: Robert De Niro was great too; even with the limited amount of screen time he had, he nailed the talk show host persona.The film itself is a SLOW burn. It's more of a character driven film that takes it's time to show you everything that happens in the titular characters life, which leads up to a BRUTAL finale. It's because of amount of breathing room this film has, it won't be for everyone; if you're expecting the usual, run-of-the-mill comic book film with tons of fighting scene, guns and explosions, you'll walk out severely disappointed. This is more of a drama/character study that lets you into Arthur's mind but once the chaos starts...OH BOY!!!!.The movie was shot really well; Todd Phillips made some great choices in this film from a direction standpoint; the lighting, certain scene transitions, zoom in/out shots were all terrific. I wouldn't mind seeing Phillips tackle more films like this one. Overall, Phoenix's performance alone was worth the price of admission; he was THAT good; however, as I stated earlier, the film takes a long time to develop, which I usually don't mind because I'm a very patient movie watcher, but if there comes a time where I'm thinking: ""that's been established, we can move on"" that's when I know they're taking a little too long and unfortunately, I had that thought a few times throughout. The good thing is the ending is really good and really established how Gotham became the chaotic, crime-ridden city we all are accustomed to and it shows why Batman is needed..."
561,I watched this movie last night. This movie is simply a masterpiece. I usually can pick out faults in movies. But not with this one. Acting was excellent! Cinematography was excellent! Writing was EXCELLENT! I was captured from the beginning and couldn't take my eyes off the screen.
562,"As a DC comic fanboy, it completely blew me away. Words alone couldn't describe how beautiful this movie is. Amazing, Fabulous, Smashing, terrifying, Masterpiece, every second.Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie. Everything about this Movie is masterful in every single way! Just as Christopher Nolan changed our expectations for what a comic book film can be with his Dark Knight Trilogy, #Joker is unlike anything we've ever seen before.I was pretty sure no one ever could match Heath ledger's Joker. But I was wrong, This might be the best DC film ever made. Joaquin pheonix breathtaking performance and Todd Phillips' clever directing did the impossible. Heath ledger will be happy watching this movie from heaven.The film offers a dark look of 1980's Gotham City, as we never have seen before in comics. It brings a darker filter to it, creating a scenario where you see no hope for a person as the main character to survive.This movie kind of mirrors how I feel on a day to day basis. I would say its way better than the Endgame and The Dark Knight, but that's for me 😉
Joker is an outstanding cinematic achievement that's sure to be talked about for years yet to come.Experience it... And the ending of the film just blows your brain away. A sure nomination for this year's Oscars."
563,"Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar for his performance in this movie..But the movie hadn't reached what was expected from it.
Tod Phillips did an excellent work in directing but this movie has what's called typically lazy writing..How can be murdering 3 random guys who happened to be working for Wayne interprises in a subway train by an anonymous guy wearing a clown mask be a spark for a revolution and riot?..The killer didn't even know them or what they were working.. The question is why people consider him a hero and a symbol for their riot?..Why they even criticize Thomas Wayne for sympathizing with them?.. It was an attempt to make the movie darker and the atmosphere of this society so dark but It failed.
Also considering the movie R-rated was just another propaganda from Warner Brothers..the violence scenes in the movie aren't that savage..there's no so offensive words and no reason for Rating it as R.
The 2 hours runtime for the movie was short for the events and the story..this movie deserved at least extra 20 minutes to give its best.
The movie is a mixture between Taxi Driver and V for Vendetta so there's not so much creativity in the idea of the movie.
Most of the movie is a buildup to be joker..It's not like any comic book movie..It's more about depression and psychology.
The joker here has no plan no purpose the filmmakers make the people use him as a symbol not a leader for the riot.
Finally..Being a psycho or a failure or abandoned by society or having bad time doesn't give you the right to kill people who bother you and cause chaos"
564,"It's not a 10/10. If you watch the trailers you can some what predict where the films going at a certain point. Great supporting cast especially if you are a fan of standup. The cinematography is great. Joaquin Phoenix can do anything. Without Phoenixs performance, the film might not of been able to pull the complex turns with the character in the way that was needed. I got the sense that he carried the movie and for the most part, kept it from collapsing on itself."
565,Great Joaquin! Thinking about you Joker. What a legend🤡🤡🤡🤡
566,"I saw this movie yesterday and I was completely blown away by it. To say Joaquin did an amazing job is kind of pointless, because I can't think of a single movie where he wasn't amazing.The way Joker is ""set up"" through Arthur's experiences is clever and compelling. The movie is not as action packed as you might think, but I was shocked at some of the events and it was actually painful to sit though some parts of it. Not because it was too violent or something like that, but because you could actually believe the character was in real pain.I could talk all day about all the things I loved about it. But what I think it's really funny is that some critics are actually bashing the film. I shouldn't be surprised, but right now it has a score of 58 on Metacritic. IMDB score is 9.3.As I was reading some of the critics' reviews, I was actually asking myself if I went to see a different movie. But, you know, everyone's got a right to their opinion. The sad fact about ""the critic"" is that these people get paid to say things like ""Joker, an empty, foggy exercise in second-hand style and second-rate philosophizing"" - The New York Times.Well, maybe some people are too smart compared to normal people like me. But, at the end of the day, the bright side of being a normal, maybe ""stupid"" person, is that you can enjoy the little things in life and be amazed everytime a star like Joaquin lights everything around him with his talent.I guess critics are already too bright, so there is no possibility of an enlightenment to them. Stupid people like me are tempted to think they are actually living in the dark."
567,"An ultra-dark sociopathological study steeped in deep nihilistic psychology with wildly-violent social commentary, Joker is A Clockwork Orange x Taxi Driver x RFAD with a career performance_by_Phoenix_on_supervillains'_origins._9.8/10....Review: The Joker. 80+ years of chilling sociopathological laughs, psyche-haunting as sadistically as he does The Bat's in devilish chaos untempered by morality, and the ability to bring entire cities to their knees with no superpowers - ""just a few bullets and drums of gas."" But where does such an icon of evil - the greatest comic book villain of All-Time - come from? What indescribable tragedies or societal/mental-breakdowns could mold a normal citizen into a demonic presence bent solely on carrying out some dark marching order to leave death and destruction everywhere he goes? The Dark Knight had plenty of fun with this concept, spinning the scariest thing about The Joker - the fact he could come from anywhere as a symbol of the volatile darkness and sin lurking just underneath the surface of society - with multiple incongruent origin stories tailor-made to Ledger's next victim's biggest fear (R.I.P. Legend). As did The Killing Joke with a lightly-expositioned tease that still left more than enough gray area/ambiguity in origin. When this film was first announced, I'll admit: I was vehemently against the concept out of agreement with Nolan's analyses on the subject and personification of evil it would take a damn masterpiece, a film so dangerous police would have to guard the premiere, and game-changing descent into madness.. to make work. I'm happy to say, that's what we got.The stylized violence and portrait of a man broken by society. Phillips was kind of the odd-ball in the mix here; a wildcard that - known best for his savage comedy days of The Hangover - was the farthest thing I'd expect on the radar of Scorsese-like prospects to produce such a deep, dark psychological study that's anything but funny. Yet he impressively puts on the boxing gloves and tackles the un-tackle-able giving one of the most stylized portrayals of violence and darkest films EVER made - reminiscent of (and perhaps even at-level or *passing* All-Time Classics like Taxi Driver and A Clockwork Orange). His controls the slow, hypnotic descennt into madness of an innocent, even-puffballish man you could never possibly imagine could become the Joker into the man of the house with surgical skill and detail - slinging soul-wrenchingly dark tragedies at him with the help of the screenwriters like some messed-up God bent on his demise for our entertainment like the court's jester the character is modeled after. The violence and psyche-breaking macabre painted is absolutely brutal and some of the darkest and most audible gasp-inducing I've *ever* witnessed; we see a man stabbed in the eye then head thrown against the wall repeatedly until his brain's squished to mush while his blood splatters Phoenix's white bare face with that hint of red completing his joker make-up, on screen executions with a revolver, hospital patients suffocated, and child abuse with freaking radiators and beating him all swirling a completely-realistic backstory of where a guy like The Joker could come from. Philips even fits in some fan service amongst all the psychologically and viscerally-heavy sociopathology in Batman references and exact recreation of the finger gun recreation from Taxi Driver and royal blue Dark Knight police car-reversed shot also ending on a Shyamalan-ic twist ending not even breaking comics lore!Phoenix's performance. Already one of the top actors in the world boasting an illustrious 3x-Oscar nom'd filmography from the visceral You Were Never Really Here to opposite-spectrum Her and The Master, Joaquin Phoenix predictively rises to the ultimate supervillain role in unbelievable fashion. Nicholson said the role ""does something to you."" Leto did not break character the entire time while filming even sending castmates dead carcasses and prophylactics leading them to question if he was okay, and the All-Time legendary Ledger tragically lost his mind in the role ultimately overdosing in a hotel drug/madness-fueled rage unable to separate from reality any longer: THAT's how powerful this role is. Phoenix tackles it with masterful skill and ballsiness for one of the greatest performances of his career and a life-time take on the villain to end all villains - so visceral down to even miniscule details like physicality, varied going from innocent puffball to sadistic killer by the end of the story, and impressive in laugh alone it demands dissertational exposition - reportedly watching over 250+ hours of an actual medical/psychological condition called sociopathological laughing wherein patients laugh uncontrollably while unable to express other emotions - for that twinge of sorrow that finds immaculate fit in Phoenix's tragic-comedian portrayal. The rest of the performances by its storied cast are phenomenal too, especially Pacino's downright-sadistic talk show host milking victims for cash and fame, Zazie Beets' (not so) love interest, Frances Conroy's Wayne-obsessed mother so cold she questions her own son's dreams with lines like ""don't you have to be funny to be a comedian?"", and Cullens' evil portrayal of Thomas Wayne.Intellectually-complex sociopathology study and social commentary on extremely-important topics. The film tackles mental illness, consumerism, ""woke""/cancel culture, social media culture, human nature, noir-elements, and multiple philosophical ideologies from nihilism to cynicism.. all in under 2 hours through a comic book/supervillain-lens for one of the most impressive screenplays ever produced. As its tagline alludes to, we are all taught/conditioned from the time we are young minds - silly-putty in society's hands - to put on a happy face and hide our pain/failures while extenuating our accomplishments (real or fake) desperately seeking 5 minutes of fame or the approval of people we barely know to convince us our lives have meaning, whether it's fame in olden days or on social media today. That invisibility feeling mirrored by the effects of bullying for the enjoyment of others is dangerous and breeds violence/criminality of potential Joker-proportions as the film correctly brings to light also playing off the at-tim.. well, often-cruel (self-interested, greedy, etc.) nature of humans picking up right where Taxi Driver left off in harsh sociological analysis. The script is so dastardly in setting up the strings for Joaquin's transition to Joker that it presents us some of the harshest events a human being could endure - also definitely-realistic especially in this time period seemingly devolving in sensitivity/empathy as time goes on - like men of power and influence abandoning/covering up/locking away marital affairs without giving the victims even a dime of their billions, or inviting losers on their talk show just to embarrass them in front of millions as proto-clickbaiting as a showcase highlighting some of the worst, most callous, brutalistic, animalistic points of human nature surprisingly-widespread in society if you sit down and think about it. The mental illness cogitation is also phenomenal and IMPORTANT, playing up the depressed nihilism or even-suicidal thoughts these illnesses can induce with haunting quotes like ""I have never been happy for even one minute of my entire life"" and ""you ask weekly if i've had any bad thoughts - *all I have* are bad thoughts"", also hinting at its bludgeoned treatment by a society for just another instance of how cruel the system is rivalling any supervillain playing down serious medical conditions with terminal effects as ""fake"" or ""not a big deal""; ""something to suck up""; ""get over"", etc.Flaws in Joker are singularly limited to its opening. Irising-in to the dressing room of Phoenix's Arthur and him listening to crime reports while doing his make-up and enacting the cry/forced hands-smile from the posters is a bit premature and abrasive when we have no idea what's happened to make him so sad. The film takes a few minutes to get comfortable and hit its stride, but once it does - it is absolutely glorious. The crying over SJW-isms and controversy surrounding the film is absolutely *ridiculous*: 1) any real critic with even a shred of journalistic integrity can separate a legendary, All-Time great film from a couple of political disagreements (I also didn't see them have problems with in Taxi Driver or A Clockwork Orange as virtually-the-same concept but now a problem due to the times it's fashionable to be constantly-offended, virtue-signal, and be fake-""woke"" than do your duty to your field, 2) it's a VILLAIN origin film, what do you possibly expect: lightness and no violence? Also, villains have been humanized for empathy countless times in superhero media from Raimi's 2005 SM2 Doc Ock to Kingpin's family in Into The Spider-Verse mere months ago but not a peep of complaints it sounds like people just hold DC to a 10x-harder/impossible hypocrisy scale, and 3) do white men not deserve any empathy for objectively-tragic things happening in their lives like mother-strokes, child abuse, learning your *entire life and entire parenthood was a lie*, etc.? That is the opposite of ""woke"" if you ask me and animalistic disregard for human suffering with no compassion or empathy - democracy is founded on the difference and freedom of beliefs and expression it's literally racist and sexist to silence some by definition.Overall, Joker is one of the darkest films ever made and a masterpiece 2nd only to The Dark Knight for starting the ultra-realist trend in comic book films.An ultra-dark sociopathological study steeped in deep nihilistic psychology &realism with wildly-violent social commentary, Joker is A Clockwork Orange x Taxi Driver x RFAD with a career performance by Joaquin Phoenix on supervillains' originsOfficial CLC Score: 9.8/10"
568,Good look into the psychological development of the joker.. not a movie for those looking for an action packed film.
569,"Joker was a true masterpiece. One of the years best. Up there with endgame and once upon a time in Hollywood. Huge die hard joker fan for years. This movie did everything I wanted to see out of a joker film. Great set up and character development. 2nd act was a tiny bit slow, but still interesting. The 3rd act was incredibly. Very dark and suspenseful. Had a very well done ending. Phoenix's performance was as good as it gets. Possibly even better than the great Heath Ledger. Very very good movie. Go see it now. Diffinetly an oscar contender. Possibly in my top 10 of movies. Again, breathtaking performance from Phoenix. Perfect film. Really no flaws. Dark gritty and suspenseful. Again, great film. I should stop saying great film."
570,"One of the most amazing films that I have ever seen in my lifetime. Phoenix, De Niro, and the entire cast are fantastic. Phoenix's acting is ""off the hook"" amazing. Rarely have I ever left the movie theater mesmerized by what I just saw. I am just simply glad that I saw a masterpiece like that in my lifetime...and it proved to me that the film industry, one that has been sadly fixated on CGI and special effects, is still capable of making a film that can penetrate the soul of the audience with a great script and amazing acting."
571,I went in with high expectations and came out absolutely blown away. A timeless piece of cinema with one of the greatest acting performances of all time.
572,"Todd Phillips and Joachin Phoenix have dug deep.. really deep, unearthing the first Joker character that is believable, not only in the comic book world, but in our world, the real world.The acting from Phoenix is stunning, almost too good at times which make some scenes excruciating to watch. A man's mental stability and health spiralling uncontrollably without filter. The cinematography is also spectacular, influenced largely on Scorsese's Taxi Driver as are other elements of this movie.There are also glaring similarities between this Joker and Rupert Pupkin from The King of Comedy, however De Niro's character study, in my opinion, is better, but only just.Todd Philips' direction is well balanced and he guides us between tension and climax just right.Overall, Joker is dark and not like any other comic book movie, which is truly a good thing."
573,"First of all I will say it from the get go, go see this movie. There isn't a single thing missing. The direction, the cinematography, the acting, the scores and the feelings that this movie portrays all blend together perfectly to create the masterstroke that this movie is. Many critics keep complaining that ""there isn't a clear point"" that the movie tries to make and it confuses me. The society's marginalization of people with mental illnesses and the unjust economical inequalities are for me the crystal-clear points that this movie made. Cinematography at it's purest form. This movie is a gem like no other. 10/10."
574,"From the director of ""The Hangover"" trilogy comes a dark and gritty version of Joker's origin story. His version of the Joker seems to be heavily inspired by Martin Scorsese's ""The King of Comedy"" with a touch of ""Taxi Driver"". On top of that, there are some attempts of commentary about society and how crooked it is. When you mix all those things up, you get a film that's going to divide everyone's opinions.Let's begin with the good stuff first. Easily, the best part of the film was a performance by Joaquin Phoenix. He carried this film completely and he gave one of the better performances of his career (nothing is going to beat his performance in ""The Master""). He proved once again why he's one of the best actors working today. If someone else was in his place, there's no way this film would've worked. His mannerisms, facial expressions (especially how he showed so many different emotions through laughs and eye expressions at the same time), his physicality and his vulnerability were incredible. If this film received a bit better reviews he would definitely be the main contender for that Oscar. Furthermore, the next aspect with which I was blown away was the score. I would even say that the score was a more effective way of showing emotions than the script. Because of the score at every moment, you knew how you were supposed to feel regarding what's happening on the screen, and that was achieved in a way that wasn't forceful. If you listen carefully to the score, you can even distinguish what scenes happened in reality and which were just in his imagination. Those two aspects of the film were outstanding and they carried the film noticeably. The color palette really nicely supported the script. Through the colors in the film, you could've seen in what mood the main character was and how he felt about what was happening around him. Colors helped to immerse the audience into that time period (I would say the film happened in 1981 because the movie theatre was showing the film ""Blow Out"" which came out in that year), but that wouldn't work without production design which was on the point.
The cinematography was decent. Although the director's vision wasn't groundbreaking I generally enjoyed most of the camera choices.Let's get into some aspects that weren't so good. The script. It's one of the weakest parts of the film. You get a feeling the film wanted to say a lot, but unfortunately, it ended up saying almost nothing. There were a lot of attempts to give some social commentary, but for me personally, that fell flat because there wasn't any explanation of why is everything how it is. Joker as a character for the huge part of the film was complaining about how society is bad and how everyone is mean, but there wasn't any reason given why is the world like that, beyond poverty and poor people suck and rich people are corrupted and evil. Regarding that specific aspect, I felt like the director wanted to say a lot, but it just ended up being shallow and on the nose. The film was beating you over the head of how everything is bad. I would've appreciated concluding by myself that the world is crooked, but instead, I was just told what the situation was, without any room for my own interpretations. And that explained situation wasn't backed up with any other pieces of information. This time, tell don't show approach didn't work out. Furthermore, speaking of the script, all characters except Joker were unbelievable and underwritten. Zazie Beetz was completely unutilized and the relationship between her character and the Joker was underdeveloped. The film was supposed to make you believe in their relationship, but it didn't and because of it the film suffered at the later stages of its runtime. I understood what did film tried to achieve with their relationship, but that wasn't realized very well. That sentence could've been used for many aspects of this film. Robert De Niro as an older version of Rupert Pupkin had a ton of fun in this film, one of the better De Niro's performances since ""Casino"". They could've done more with his character, but at least it seemed like he had fun with this project. So, Joker is basically the only character that was decently written, but the thing is, the director didn't make a clear choice if we were supposed to feel for him or we were supposed to hate him because of his actions. Don't get me wrong, he isn't a good person, but the film way too many times tried to make the audience sympathize with him. I don't know if that was intentional or not, but at the times it felt way too forceful.In the end, looking at the whole picture, this is a good film but isn't anything spectacular. At the same time, I would say the film was overblown with praises of how good it was, and yet at the same time, it was unfairly criticized because of some aspects in the film (e.g. the usage of violence)."
575,"Joker was an amazing movie and Joaquin Phoenix was perfect for this role, the acting was brilliant. Please consider that Phoenix's Joker is a journey to becoming the Heath's Joker and in my opinions it was perfect. Close to the end of the movie you can see a glimpse of Heat's Joker, the one that embraces his madness and starts enjoying being the villain."
576,So worth it! Amazing comic book movie that stands out from the crowd
577,"Forever alone in a crowd, failed comedian Arthur Fleck seeks connection as he walks the streets of Gotham City. Arthur wears two masks -- the one he paints for his day job as a clown, and the guise he projects in a futile attempt to feel like he's part of the world around him. Isolated, bullied and disregarded by society, Fleck begins a slow descent into madness as he transforms into the criminal mastermind known as the Joker"
578,"After I watched Joker, I needed some time to really digest it. Joker is like no other comic book/superhero movie that has ever existed. It truly transcends the genre and almost breaks it entirely. It is the kind of movie I have been wanting to see take place in the Batman universe since the Nolan films: dark, disturbing, gritty, adult, and completely the antithesis of Marvel and all it's Disney friendly content.Joaquin Phoenix is amazing in this movie. My wife asked me if he was better than Heath Ledger and Jack Nicholson as Joker. My first reaction was that he was not, but it is because he is playing a character for the entirety of the movie that is still in the process of becoming Joker. Phoenix has created a an original character that takes very little from previous Joker portrayals. It is so different from Heath and Jack that comparisons seem unfair and unnecessary.The movie looks fantastic and beautifully shot. You can really tell the Scorsese influence, but I am 100% of the opinion that this is not a copy of Taxi Driver or King of Comedy, heavily influenced, yes, but most certainly something new. Todd Phillips deserves credit for making a movie that does not seek to please the comic book/superhero audience and instead gives them something challenging like nothing that has come before in this genre.I do have some small criticisms in terms of the plot, but they do not plague the film enough to knock it down. I recommend this highly. (A-)"
579,"I guess the people not happy with this film expected a typical ""Joker"" movie. It's not. It's a film about the man who 'becomes' the Joker. A character study. This is not a feel good movie and don't expect to leave the cinema feeling happy. It's depressing, it's bleak and it's quite uncomfortable to watch at points. It has a constant fog of dread hanging over it that's heavy.
You feel sorry for this person, probably even root for him and that's a real weird thing as we know what he eventually becomes, but I suspect that was the point.
The music score is outstanding, adding massively to the film in no other way I can think of than how the track from Jaws impacted that film so much.
The filmography is also top not notch.
Phoenix is absolutely electric, you cannot take your eyes off him. If he doesn't win an Oscar for this performance, he might as well pack up and forget about it. He could do no more.
Best film I've seen in a long time, which is a weird thing as, again, you don't leave with a feel good vibe, but it's all the better for it.
Outstanding."
580,"There is no doubt in my mind that Joaquin Phoenix deserves at least an Oscar nod, if not the trophy itself. In an odd way, he reminded me of Sean Penn in that when you watch him, you forget he is an actor, all you see is the character. In reality, the rest of the cast were merely props in this one-man show... even Robert De Niro.There are a lot of Easter Eggs as nods to other films of the late 70s and early 80s, which was cool.As an origin story in the comic book universe, Joker was good, better than most. I do not judge movies based on how closely they follow a book or if they follow the rules of physics, but more if they entertain me and allow me to escape my reality for a few hours. In that sense, Joker left me wanting for more. Yeah, there are political nods that you can read into this, but they weren't forced onto the viewer, more of a backdrop.The randomness of Joker's thinking and thoughts was in a word, distracting. Because the director put me in the lead character's psychosis, I had a hard time sympathizing with any character in the movie, which makes it difficult to connect to the story.Maybe the real genius of the movie was that randomness, seeing the world through the psychotic mind of the Joker. But it didn't make for a hugely entertaining experience for me."
581,"This movie is probably about a 7.2. It is pretty enjoyable. It isn't as good as the people who are paid to post fake reviews here claim but those people are easily discovered by the fact that they rate every move 10/10.It is worse than the Dark Knight and I didn't find the Joker better than Heath's or Jack Nicholson's
This isn't an action movie so people going into it expecting that won't get it but it is a good character study which unfortunately may be boring to many people. Reminded me of There Will be Blood than Batman"
582,"If you haven't known already, this is an in-depth review of the 2019 movie Joker and it will contain a lot of spoilers. I strongly recommend you to check the movie out before reading this because it really is a masterpiece, and you should respect it by watching it in the theatres. I personally give this movie a full score as it really exceeded my expectations on all aspects of the movie. However, I understand that this movie is not for everyone. If you're more likely to watch action movies, then I don't think this movie will suit you. Here are a few criterias that I would like to talk about which made this movie an overall dark, disturbing and mesmerising masterpiece.First of all, let's talk about the cinematography and the score of this movie. It undoubtedly uses a bluish constrast to create this sort of a cold and chaotic city feeling in the early 80s or 90s, much like the movie ""A Clockwork Orange"". In my opinion, this is brilliant as it sets the mood for the movie that we're about to experience and the surrounding condition for a story that revolves around a man (Arthur Fleck) and his drastic descend into insanity, caused by the broken society. As this movie symbolises Arthur's depression, it is important to let the audience know and feel what it's like to be him, and how he view the outside world. The score in this movie is extremely phenomenal. I don't think this movie will give out such a big impact on me if this score wasn't there. What really surprises me is that you can actually feel Arthur's depression through the score, like it's secretly giving out information to you. The score gave the sort of impression where Arthur is a sad, depressed and miserable person inside a clown's body. Finally, I also think that the score serves as a signal which makes the audience feel like they are the joker. For instance, the audience is so used to hearing this music when something bad happens to Arthur that they will attach this music to a bad occurrence. As a result, supposedly a mentally-ill person is very unpredictable in some ways will be predictable now as the audience recognise the score even when something positive is happening. They kind of know when Arthur will finally snap.Secondly, let's dive into the story itself. As a summary, Arthur fleck is an innocent guy, working as a clown and a standup comedian who is driven crazy by the society. This character is portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix who, in my opinion, is one of the best actors working today. One aspect of the film which I thought is extremely brilliant, is Arthur's laugh. In previous Batman movies, the character Joker laughs all the time because they are psychotic and laughing pleases them in certain ways normal human cannot comprehend. This Joker, on the other hand, is the complete opposite. Arthur has a condition which causes him to laugh uncontrollably due to nerve problems in his brain. This, I have to salute to Todd Philips and Joaquin Phoenix for taking the risk to approach this Joker character in a different way, much different from any Joker films ever made. Every laugh, you can feel Arthur's pain and loneliness. This is very important to create and emotional attach for the audience to Arthur. I personally think that Phoenix can win an Oscar just from that laugh sequences alone. During the first act, we follow Arthur through his daily routines. He works, then he comes home to his mother. every day. This tells the audience that Arthur is still a normal human being and not some psychopath from the very beginning. Then, things get rough and he loses his job for dropping a gun at a children's hospital. There's the subway scene where he was physically attacked by a few Wall Street guys. Due to the immense pressure, he killed all three of them using a gun which was given to him by a colleague of his. Although we are suppose to feel terrified by all this, we feel a sense of victory and satisfaction because that is how Arthur feels after killing them. This is also the scene where the gap between Arthur and the Joker narrows down. There is also this scene where Arthur realised that he was imagining his relationship with a neighbour of his, which was revealed later on in the movie. Although some people think that the reveal of this scene should be at the very end of the movie, I still think that it is perfect where it is. By putting this scene hanging in the middle of the movie, it will cause the audience to not be able to distinguish what's real and what's not. They might be thinking, the past isn't real. But, there are still a few more acts in the movie. Are those still real? I also like the fact that the Murray Franklin Show is very realistic. For example, laughters can be heard when Murray says something that is funny, much like a real talk show. As a result, when Arthur kills Murray at the very end during the talk show, it creates a very disturbing but realistic portrayal of an interview gone wrong. The audience no longer sites Arthur because they are deceived by Arthur's choice and they no longer recognise the man they once sympathised for. The last act is simply extraordinary and I cannot put into words how amazing it is. This is the part I simply don't want to spoil because it is your own choice how the story unfolds. There are no correct or wrong answers to what really happened to Arthur at the end because the audience is the Joker in this sense.Lastly, i wrote this review in hopes that people take this movie seriously. This is not a superhero flick or any other sort of a trilogy. It's a stand-alone film and a character study of Joker. I sincerely hope that this kind of movies, although violent must be exposed to teenagers that are not the age of 18 as well. It's a very mature film and it can get teenagers nowadays to realise and be prepared for what's ahead of them. Do not fall into the wrong hands. Be wise and know how to manage your stress. If not, you're going to be like Arthur. That's what the movie is trying to say.That's all. I hope you find this review helpful."
583,"It's an absolute riot ! JP take a bow 👏Few scenes are just too good.The last scene where he talks about how the society treats him like trash.
The voice , the mannerisms are on point. Like a child who needs some love but has been deprived of it.I like the hospital scene where the drops the gun and puts a finger on his lips suggesting the kids to keep quiet about the episode.All these scenes still show that probably Arthur has some traces of innocence before he accepted the darkness inside."
584,"I loved the movie and believe it is one of my personal favorites ever, but many people are giving it bad reviews. This movie will please those who understand it and see the underlying messages, which makes it powerful, moving, entertaining, and real. But if you don't see the true meaning (or don't want to), it just seems like an unnecessarily dark and violent addition to the Batman ""franshise"". Another reason some people may dislike this movie and find it ""boring and too slow"" is because there is an extraordinary lack of CGI, which for me personally makes it all the better... and then some. If this sounds like a negative to you, please stick to The Avengers and don't waste your time, because you will. It's not cookie cutter, it's not a money grab, it's a movie that makes you think and can be perceived in many ways. Exceptional writing and a surreal acting performance turns this would-be great movie into something truly special.
There isn't a right way for Joker to be perceived, there is just a wrong way, and that's where the bad reviews come from, expecting something it was never meant to be, while missing/overlooking the greatness of this film."
585,So so good! Incredibly dark and intense. Brilliantly acted! The best film I've seen in a long time! Well done Joaquin!
586,A more human and logical approach of the origins of joker! Definitely will touch your souls and remember every scene for a long time! A must see
587,"Literally one of the best movies I've ever seen. The acting the scenario the music, literally everything was unbelievably amazing"
588,Joker Movie is going to make a revolution like Watchmen. It's just a masterpiece which shows our society.
589,"Crazy story, but not from DC Gotham city
This Joker is not amazing, not smart or creative. This Joker not for people, he is for Hoakine Phoenix, to show, he is fantastic drama. Don't show this movie to children"
590,"I'm blown away at the positive reviews... I went to this movie wanting to like it but found myself struggling to stay awake.What was it about?Sad, dark, nothingness. Blah. Boring, just boring."
591,"JP is an undeniably intense actor who certainly puts his soul into what he does. Everything from the honored actor is well-made as a work of art. But now the movie is not called JP but the Joker and that is where the fun ends. A movie cannot start and end with a solo performance if everything is empty around. It is truly a totally entertaining film that lacks momentum altogether. It also deviates so much from the original that I would like to say that it is no longer a DC movie, but instead a film about a seriously ill person who only feels compassion for himself. No, even though I bought the ticket, I don't buy the movie concept."
592,"Joker is absolutely brilliant. It's gritty and utterly captivating. It's a tough watch at times and yet you can't look away. I would not recommend it for the faint of heart, but if you love crime drama, 1970s movies, or very early Scorsese films you might enjoy Joker. The film is getting a tough rap from the mainstream critics, mainly because it's very divisive, but also because it shines a harsh light on some very rough subjects, including class warfare, access to health care, and the mental health crisis in America. If any of these things make you uncomfortable don't go see this film. As for my opinion, Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar and so does the director. Yeah, it's that good.One last thing, the photography demands that you see it in the best possible quality. Also, for goodness sake, don't let your kids see this movie. This is not a Batman film. This is not a Marvel popcorn movie. It's a ""hard R"" crime drama."
593,"Some people say that it is too dark for their likings, and made them uncomfortable. That's the point of the movie. It let's you litterly stand in the shoes of a mentally ill man. If you don't understand the movie then you should probably not even review it because if you missed the movie's mark all what will come out of your mouth is bull bull."
594,"As I see the rating go from 9/10 to 8.9/10 I wonder who are the kind of people that would put this movie to such shame. Ultimately this movie needs a review of at THE LEAST 9/10 here. #YangGang #HumanityFirst, but 9/10 people.. Come on, amazing movie!!"
595,What a performance by Joaquin. The way they build the character is mind blowing! Loved Heath Ledger but Joaquin has actually outdone him here...
596,"I'm not a fan of Batman movies but went to see this with my teenage son. It's truly one of the best movies I have ever seen. I have never felt a movie to be PERFECT, but this movie truly I s. They just don't make movies like this anymore with the perfect story, script, cinematography, score, acting! It will be revered as a cinematic masterpiece.
And I do appreciate the political statement it's making. It's not condoning violence. It's trying to reveal what harm mental illness which is ignored by society and even bullied and ridiculed can do.
Just saw it for a second time tonight! Will watch again!"
597,"Horribly shallow, derivative and repugnant. Dramatically flawed - actually the story of the mother told through the excruciatingly telescoped lens of the son. In the process it vilifies just about everyone (but no points for consistency because if they'd had the guts, a struggle with sexuality might have actually made it interesting {I can't help thinking the thought was on Joaquin's mind but the film declared otherwise}). One of the profound master strokes of Ledger's portrayal was to specifically preclude the need of an origin story yet like so many the need to have that incredible manifestation explained willed me to my seat for the whole acrid, eat-all-your-stinky-seventies-references-or-there's-no-dessert duration. What is eventually slopped out in response to the riddle of the joker (I promise to take that no further) however is so remarkably banal that it better serves to illuminate the gluttonous, exploitative villainy of the corporations behind the production. That said, production values were decent although I couldn't help comparing the dim cinematography to the exquisitely stark visions of the Nolan movies."
598,Unbelievable!!! Movie of the year absolutely. 👏🏻
599,"This masterpiece of a film shows how, one sort of small Director and one of the best actors of all time can come together to make a movie that reflects society in the past but also today in some of the worst ways possible.
With the director, Todd Phillips, that did movies like the Hangover and Old School he shows that not only can he make very funny comedies but also a dark and serious period film. He's camera work throughout the entire film with over the shoulder shots and tracking shots of characters show how much he cared about the style and the feel of the 1980's Gotham setting.
The stand out of the entire film was Joaquin Phoenix's performance of the titular character of The Joker, but it doesn't feel like he is playing a Joker that we have ever scene before. We know the look of him and we know what his name is but his back story and many unique aspects to the character such as his laugh, and his voice are very different. Joaquin Phoenix seems to know that he is playing Arthur Fleck more than he is playing The Joker. By losing 50 lbs and learning dance moves and practicing the laugh of people with Pathological Laughter shows how much he cared about this role and the challenge it took for him to become The Joker and Arthur Fleck.
This movie as a whole is a period film and a character study. It shows how society is today with corruption and looking out the little guy. It shows how people can be treated so poorly and not cared about. It shows the dangers of what can come when things are slowly taken away from a person in their life. It also shows how mental illness can affect a person and their outlook on life. One quote is ""what do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash?"". This perfectly sums up how society can warp the mind of someone especially someone with a mental illness.
This movie deserves all the praise it's getting and will hopefully be talked about for years to come."
600,"What can I say? This movie speaks for itself. It's amazing, it's mesmerizing, it's dark, it's brutal, it's the best movie of 2019 hands down. At first we see the sufferings of the main character Arthur Fleck. Then we see his journey into madness and accepting his identity, Joker. The ending was magnificent. It's a movie you just have to see to experience how good it actually is."
601,In a time of over saturated comic book movies it's a beautiful irony that this is the film currently attempting to push boundaries in the genre and break out of the comedy infused entertainment formula we have had for the last decade is the one film about a clown.
602,"Even if you are not a fan of dark, psychological thrillers, there is no denying that Phoenix has set a whole new standard for the acting world. Phoenix portrays the joker like never before, leaving the audience to pity the character. I have seen the movie twice since it's release date on Friday, and can say with confidence that it is an instant classic for sure. It opens up new doors for film and actors. Arguably the best acting of the past decade."
603,"Not for noobs,
Pros are cordially invited.
The movie is based on the reality and the truth."
604,"Beyond Phoenix excellant portrayal of a wretched mentally ill man...we felt cheated. Anticipated 10 minutes of development and the rest, villany. Sorry..this isn't."
605,Spectacular ...phenomenal..brearhtaking !! Joaquin Phoenix is truely a LEGEND!!!!
606,"Amazing acting from Phoenix!!! Absolutely solid performance. The score was equally incredible. My only complaint was there was a lot of build up time to becoming Joker, not a lot of Joker time. I understand this is an origin story, I just feel that I wanted a bit more in the end. But all in all amazing movie, you must go see it!"
607,"All the props to the team that made this fantastic movie. I have no words to express how i'm feeling about this movie, it was shocking, terifying and beautiful at the same time. I had high expectations about this movie and it delivered! The only movie i was not mad that i paid to see it in theatre. I don't know who are those people that the news say they walked out of the theatre because Joker was bad, or too violet, but they have no idea what they are talking about. This movie is perfect, from every scene, the cinematografy, the acting, the lighting, and omg, the MUSIC. 10/10 Best movie i've seen in the last 10 years. Give it a chance, don't let negative reviews fool you, you should watch it and decide for yourself it it's good or no."
608,"I'll first start by saying this movie is very dark. It's the type of movie that makes you uncomfortable at some point in every scene. That being said, it's exactly the way this character should be portrayed. Amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix as he takes you through the journey for Jokers evolution. This isn't a movie full of action packed fighting or battle scenes. Instead, it's a real life example that mirrors our world today. Amazing performances. Amazing film."
609,I was just stunned after watching the movie . A sure nomination for the Oscars !!!
610,"Yes, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful job in his portrayal of the Joker. Albeit this Joker is plain and simple just mentally ill. He is generally portrayed in previous genres as a criminal genius mastermind. A person with wit, and masterful comprehension of trickery, and chemicals.This Joker is no fun, and highly delusional. You may question his intellect as he has to look up simple jokes in a diary he keeps. Yes, for the most part his jokes fall flat. Jack Nicholson' clever portrayal in Batman raised the bar that in my opinion has never quite been reached.I found myself uncomfortable with this portrayal as you would with someone acting out next to you on a subway. In that respect, Joaquin portrays this bit of brazen craziness to a tee. Craziness for the sake of craziness does not make for entertainment. If a sane person were locked up in a mental institution, you would not be entertained. And that is a bit how this movie felt."
611,"Ok so been to see the JOKER on the back of all the reviews on here saying its a cinematic masterpiece etc etc, and while i cant argue that Phoenix certainly gives an acting masterclass the actual movie itself is dare i say it a bit slow, and a tad boring ( i dont care if you dont agree ) and as for the Joker himself he is no where near as good as the one portrayed by Heath Ledger and no where near as scary.
The Joker here comes across as a sad pitiful character who in all honesty needs a swift boot in the short and curlies followed by a good wash.After i watched the Dark Knight i could not wait to see it again but certainly dont feel that way about JOKER"
612,"I'm mesmerised , overwhelmed by the sheer beauty of Joaquin's Acting. The best cinematic experience I hve had in a long time. So glad I watched this in theatre."
613,"One of the best movies I've seen in my whole life. This movie has a lot of levels. The psychopath construction is uncomfortable and attractive. It brings an invitation to ask ourselves if the concept of ""good and bad"" makes sense. Because all of us have the potential to become monsters when we're not able to control nor understand our own demons. But only some can exploit their true nature by being precisely a monster. And that keeps me thinking about the bravery and its shadows. It's a movie that hangs onto you and assaults some proper ideas during a burst of laughter. Joaquin Phoenix does an unbelievable job, he's one of my favourite actors and his work impressed me deeply. Incredible art direction, the colours and photography are the perfect apology for Mr Todd Phillips's masterpiece.Incredible and captivating."
614,"What to say about this film that does not reflect the title, is the best we have been able to enjoy lately, everything is wonderful, the exquisite photography, the right atmosphere, the amazing and unsurpassed script, all seasoned in addition with a sublime direction of Todd Phillips, which shows that we must follow him very closely in future projects.
And I leave a point exclusively for Joaquin Phoenix, the guaranteed winner of the next Oscar, in my opinion it is one of the best male performances in the history of the seventh art, I do not think there are concrete words to do justice to his interpretation, therefore I will not say anything else.
Everyone should watch this movie. 10/10"
615,"Driving to watch it I was excited while expecting less. I witnessed film history, the work of the greats of today, a screen masterpiece, ""Tennessee Williams"" psychoanalytical deep trip, to be discussed for years."
616,"What amazed me was that actors of this quality read a script and took on the role. 2019 hasn't been a great year for movies, sadly it saw budget movies being churned out, this movie fits in that bucket."
617,"I don´t understand the critics this movie is awfull,it is very slow not a lot off action scenes,and jaquin phoenix plays the joker like a little child,the visitors that left
the cinema left the cinema because the film is boring
Joker is a joke and wenn that is the Joker that Batman challenged then Batman has a easy job"
618,"Little to say. I expected a masterpiece of a movie only based on comic books, and concentrated only in a character study for the ages.It is.Perfect story. Twists. Real drama. Real pain. Darkly funny at times, but not comedic in the least. It is violent, as it should, but never glorifying violence like the rest of the comic book adaptations (even the ones I love like Man of Steel or Infinity War or...)It is just perfect. I give my ""Thanks"" to all the people involved (I gave my money too, which is more important to them).----------- As a negative, It's not particularly original, with too many things (a few times, scenes) from King of Comedy and Taxi Driver.
It is clearly better than those movies though"
619,"This is the definition of the word STUNNING! Because that's what Phoenix was at this movie! It is a performance of a lifetime! I have no idea how he achieved this turn and brought this character to its highest but it cant get any better. We love all Jokers but here we have a different character, a different man, a man that we can finally understand, finally understand Joker's Why... This character was portrait-ed multidimensional by Phoenix! It was about time to expose today's society. This movie will shock you in a way, make you sad and at the end it will make you happy with the Batman connection and the comic and gaming scene! The whole movie was a masterpiece and can lead to many awesome sequels with Batman, Harley Quin etc... They just need to be careful. An Oscar performance with a small budget! Good job DC."
620,Phoenix tries to put a great effort. This movie is truly devoid of any plot or interaction. Not much happens and the pace is terrible. The overall theme of galvanizing those who society has overlooked was much better done in Fight Club.
621,"Acting and cinematography are outstanding. Joaquin is incredible throughout. That's as far as the compliments go.The plot lacks any creativity, it's unnecessarily dark and smacks of a sequel within 15 minutes of being seated in the theatre. I get there has to be some character development but at least leave the feeling of getting rinsed for cash until the end of the movie.Whilst I appreciate the inevitability of the Joker's story being told, I feel the consistently dark nature of the film left me bereft of any positivity. Nolan achieved the balance; this movie did not. This was highlighted when the audience laughed at the vertically challenged man being unable to escape the apartment after a particularly brutal murder. It's a sad indictment that we've become so desensitised that this is deemed comedy.There is no humour to be found here. Nor any light. It's watchable to see the Phoenix tour de force but don't expect to feel like it's money well spent. The narrative is wooly and many good songs are now ruined by being in this soundtrack. Avoid."
622,"Joaquin Phoenix's acting is heartbreaking and horrifying; he gives a tremendously physical performance and it is easily up there as one of his best.I found the film astounding: the cinematography is beautiful, the pacing is flawless, the tension builds to breaking point. The whole film comes together brilliantly in a character study that is so believable and gritty that I held my breath the whole way through.I know this review is coming across as gushing, but honestly I cannot imagine how the character could have been portrayed any better. It might be my favourite Batman movie to date, and the Batman is not even in it! I hope this movie is a taste of things to come for the franchise; it makes the Marvel universe look trivial and childish."
623,"Forget about the critics! They always bash DC for being too 'dark' and, in this case, for promoting violence and mental illness.Enough with the lame joke-infested Marvel type of movies targeted towards kids. The world needs to appreciate the more serious movies that tend to focus on crucial cinematic elements (in particular, plot and character development).This film is no where close to boring as it really shows you the Joker's transition whilst emitting a disturbing vibe that will leave you cringing simply from Joaqin's phenomenal acting."
624,"The movie is very good. A unique story, and Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely superb and definitely on par with Heath ledgers performance in the dark knight (2008). While the movie is slow in parts, you are always on the edge of your seat. Amazing film. Would love to see Joaquin as the Joker again! Nothing but a 10/10"
625,You never seen anything like this Joaquin shines so bright that you would be amazed of how great he is in this movie everything about this movie is perfect i promise.
626,"Total flat storyline not a single peak moment, nothing new, nothing amazing, nothing entertaining except the acting. Just a man crying about his existence. We have seen this story a thousand times in thousand different movies also multiple times in batman too. We know that joker struggled a lot in his personal life as a common man, dull story ruined the character. I see people saying a lot good about it maybe just because they can't betray their joker but I like joker for his madness not his crying or sick attitude in his personal life."
627,"Never have I ever seen a film that has such depth to the story and the character development. If you have ever felt a crippling loneliness, i think this film can really speak to you. The execution is spectacular. Joaquin and Hildur definitely earned their Oscars. Genuinely a Shame that Todd didn't get his too."
628,"I'm grateful I didn't watch this at the movies. I would have walked out. You've actually taken the p*ss out of all of us and should be ashamed.The acting is fine, whatever. But why did this need to be about The Joker? Why? It could just as easily been a psychological drama about anyone with mental illness. Please stop all this pandering to the Academy. Sickeningly transparent to me that you wanted to create Heath Ledger fever again.And honestly, who the heck cares how the Joker became the villain anymore?"
629,"Watched this film after hearing how great it was, but also aware it was a controversial film.
Simply put - this is a marvellous film, you don't need to read any of the reviews
i have watched it twice already and I'll most likely watch it again.To my mind - it's a Masterpiece.
I have the feeling this film will be talked about for a long time."
630,Yes I am that blown away by Joaquin! But I am not surprised! When I found out they casted him I was like PERFECT CHOICE!!!!!!!!! He actually got me to become a fan of Johnny Cash! My fav scene is the dancing on the steps! Hilarious! I love everything about it!
631,"The first time I've come out of the cinema in a long time feeling satisfied, excited and amazed. Joaquin Phoenix carries the whole movie, with his portrayal of the joker being immersive and entertaining. Every aspect was amazing- great choice of songs, brilliant acting and beautiful cinematography. So impressed!"
632,Other than that. This is a well directed movie with great performances.
633,"Guys just go and watch it in cinemas, this is a master-peace. I dont have any words to say, incredible work. Thank you."
634,"It's hard to believe someone doesn't understand the violence and the villain formation in this movie. The script doesn't try to make the idea of a redeemer violence it's a lunatic story, it touches in sensible points about human mind and our destructive behaviors. Transcendental, Joker is the truly villain, not just a purple guy snapping fingers."
635,"You finished a very great performance, I just want to say thank you Joaquin Phoenix!!!"
636,"Joker takes you on an emotional, disturbing yet a magnificent journey. Joaquin Phoenix puts on another brilliant show and the greatest character continues to live on as the favorite super villian."
637,"The one lesson I learnt from this movie is only if he had one person whom he could his friend, Joker would have had something going for him.
Be nice to people, you might be the only one for a person."
638,"Finally DC movie who come with DC's DNA since Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, superb action from Phoenix and 'out of the box' plot, something that Marvel will struggle with...."
639,"I can't find words to describe Phoenix performance, just amazing! What a movie"
640,"As a lifelong fan of western comics, anime, TV sci-fi and cult & masterpiece movies, this film truly is a historical landmark of cinema. Kudos to Mr. Phoenix and Mr. Phillips, they have achieved something no one else had until now in the superhero genre, true art (Except maybe Nolan's and Ledger's Dark Knight).
Superhero-wise, this Joker has been brought to us under an entirely different light. He makes you feel sorry for him, mad at society for having forsaken such a hurt man. Appaled of how the system can abandon a sick and lonely person in the time of most need. Truly despicable are crowds of people who mock a man dressed as a clown with a smile, but who cries inside. A cruel, bitter and tasteless joke this is."
641,"I have second thoughts before watching that movie. But after seeing that, absolutely amazing!
I'm sure Heath Ledger will give thumbs up in the sky!
And the actor should get an Oscar 100%!!
I recommend to watch you wont regret!"
642,"Dark, uncomfortable, thought provoking film. Gritty, dirty, well observed cinematography. A commentary on our times, broken systems, abuse, lack of care; be it societal, physical, mental or pastoral. Owes much to Taxi Driver and King of Comedy. Takes Heath Ledger's Joker deeper and darker. All in all a fitting origins (back story or prequel, whatever) tale or stand alone movie. Complaints about violence? Meh, I've seen more in a Avengers movie...at least it has context.
We genuinely feel for the Joker, is he a misunderstood hero, a figurehead for a anarchic uprising or a monster?
Or is he what our uncaring, unpleasant society has created....?
There's more humanity in this film than the whole of the Nolan Batman franchise.
Does he save the girl on the train with his maniacal laughter distracting the abusers, not able to bear seeing another human abused or can he just not help it?
As he descends deeper into madness, seeking solace in his delusions, finding release in violent acts, you still empathise with him and despise what society forced him to be.
Watch this, love the streetscapes, colour palette, edgy soundtrack and fine method acting from Joaquin Phoenix - Oscar? Oh I think so."
643,This is the best movie ever ! The Joker movie does touch on many psychological issues. In many of his words there is indeed the truth that lurks in this world
644,"One of the best films I have ever seen, I had to go and see it twice"
645,"The comparisons to Taxi Driver are more than accurate and reminds you of other loner-vigilante style noir movies (Drive), but make no mistake, this has it's own mystique. Other people have already (and will continue) to explain why this movie is already a timeless classic. The themes explored here are ubiquitous in decades of character study cinema, but it never feels dull in this movie, it feels like a mind-stimulating food-for-thought.This movie made me FEEL, it made it's presence FELT. There was palpable tension in the theater, we knew we were witnessing something truly grandiose, but restrained enough to not push the pretentious border. It's a shame that this movie might have a stigma around it due to hyperbolic hysteria by headline/attention-seeking critics because there are far more violent films out there than this, this just happened to call out society and make the creators of a psychopath feel culpable, the truth hurts. This movie tells the truth.Joaquin Phoenix is a master at playing the brooding/unhinged role.If you watch movies for the purpose of wanting something to leave an impression on you, this is your movie. It does that in spades, and is one that welcomes repeat viewing.My movie of the year for 2019. Don't think another will come close. The House That Jack Built was my movie of the year for 2018, so I guess you can say I have a certain taste :)"
646,"One of the greatest comic-book villain movies in years! This movie blew my mind away when I watched it and there was so much explaining necessary to actually figure out what the Joker's whole story is about in this movie! I even rewatched the movie to get an even better understanding to what's going on! What an amazing movie! But let's get to the aspects of the movie. The story is absolutely unique, being taken in a more realistic approach! He doesn't get dipped in acid and turn insane, instead its from real life factors that turn him insane! The joker already has a mental illness in the first place too and how the story sets off from there is truly shocking and disturbing! There is so much to this story to explain, even you can come up with many theories on joker's life! It's truly depressing but terrifying at the same time! Then the acting with the characters. Joaquin Phoenix did so good in playing the Joker that he deserves to win an Oscar for it! I would be shocked if he doesn't win an Oscar at all because his acting was spot on to disturb us and shock us! All the other actors/actresses that were left did great in their acting of their characters, with many giving a realistic reaction to the joker! Then the style of the movie. The movie did so well in not overusing dramatization and truly offered a great dark theme throughout the Joker movie! As much as I have to say, this movie is one of the greatest movies this year and its truly the greatest villain origin movie I've ever watched! Definite recommend for everyone to watch!"
647,"No superpowers, buf still the best villain ever. Just best performance, outstanding. This movie shows another reason why We love the joker"
648,"Dark, gritty and raw, a spit and saw dust film that delivers a meaningful and compelling story, no CGI nonsense needed. Great character building, great production, they got the mood and character of Gotham spot on was bould and unapologetic which I really liked."
649,"Beautiful picture, tremendous story telling, enormous acting, and amazing directing. Everything about this film is perfect!"
650,"Remarkable movie, best thriller of all time. Scary to think people who really are crazy will watch."
651,"Many of us over the years have been attached and thrilled with the ""Clown Prince of Crime"" as D.C. comic fans know as the one and only ""Joker"". And we've seen different takes and spins from Romero's camp, to Ledger's dark wild crazy turn, and the man the one and only Jack played the clown with vanity and brought a proper turn to a bad guy while having fun(Nicholson's ""Joker"" was like that of the late 70's early 80's ""Joker"" in D.C. comics) now enter Phoenix who's much different with a creepy origin story.Set in the early 1980's Gotham city is gritty, raw and the social and political climate is in the gutter as just getting by is so tough. And just tip toeing and dancing his way thru the drama is Arthur Fleck(in a hell of a turn from Joaquin at least nominate him for a ""Golden Globe"" or ""Oscar"") a lonely and depressed mommies boy who's a skinny starving clown who just can't fit in he's a society misfit. It's really somewhat of a sad character study.However hope is possible in the form of Fleck wanting to get away from being a clown for children as his real dream is to be a standup comedian as his smile and crazy lasting laugh is always present! As laughter is the cure for his pain! His hope of escape is to appear on a late night talk show hosted by Murray Franklin(Robert De Niro) where Arthur hopes to showcase his talents. Also the only other wild card pleasure he has in his life is dating a single mom named Sophie(Zazie Beetz) from his apartment building. And his sick mother Penny keeps Arthur hanging on with love and hope as that keeps him hanging on.Only secrets and ghost of the past and painful memories only destroy the fragile mind of Arthur even more as a connection to millionaire Thomas Wayne is revealed and even more shattering is how this connection and more events will lead to ""The Dark Knight"". Great and excellent work from director Todd Phillips who despite making a stand alone dark character study still connects things up with others in the D.C. universe.Many might see this picture as a dark tragedy I think it's a take and spin on how one is affected by life and then they take on a different role after years of being abused and mistreated in the world by it's people. Still this film is excellent because it's unique and finally glad a stand alone movie celebrates ""The Joker""(the greatest comic book bad guy ever!) As Joaquin's performance was raw, gritty, and a lashing out of some payback to society. Wow enough said best D.C. comics character study ever made!"
652,This movie is stunning. Joaquin Phoenix performance as the Joker is one of the greatest of all time. Combine with an amazing script and Joaquin Phoenix's amazing performance give us a character driven film that is one of the best movies ever made.
653,"Despite the third best performance of Joaquin Phoenix's career, even he can't keep the film interesting. I never believed the hype this film was getting and I was right. Fanboys dream but as true film goes, it's quite terrible. The difference between fan reviews and critic reviews says it all, and even the critics were being generous."
654,"See the subject. Zero, nada..see Falling Down if you are searching for your problem solver."
655,The movie was good for what it was trying to do I get it and fully understand that it was a beginning of the joker. The how and why he is who he is...BUT it was sooooo boring! Phoenix was an amazing pick for this movie he did nothing wrong the body transformation was sound and how he moved then the laugh he choice. But the movie just moved soooo slowly. Something happens and I thought it would pick up but it just kept the same pace it was hard for me to keep my eyes open. The only reason I did was in the hopes it would pick up. If I didn't see the move I would have been ok with that. The best part I didn't see coming and was very happy it happened was when the black lady neighbor was a figment of his imagination most of her screen time! And if you break this down: he wouldn't have killed people if only he had his meds!
656,I'm 47. I've been around. I've been to the cinema a LOT. Never been to see a film twice though. Joker I've seen 3 times it is THAT good. Well to me anyway.
657,This movie mad me unbearably sad but I loved every moment of it a beautiful beautiful joker movie
658,"I couldn't care any less about comics and I went into this blind without knowing about any of the hype expecting a ""meh"" movie. This is now my favourite movie of all time. It is one of those movies that makes you want to run back home to search for any scenes that might be available on the net and re-watch them again and again. Every scene is so powerful, gripping and fresh. The music, acting, dancing and cinematography is mesmerising. This is a masterpiece."
659,"Let's just get this straight......if Joaquin Phoenix does not win an Oscar for this performance than there is something wrong in the world. As for the movie? Disturbing, thought provoking, fascinating, inciteful and just brilliant. A comic book movie that's not a comic book movie. I never thought Heath Ledger's performance as the joker could be matched but Phoenix's version is simply outstanding."
660,"Hands down. Oscar worthy on many fronts. Phoenix really raised the bar on Joker with a stellar performance. Critics are out of touch, partisan, narrative pushers who couldn't review anything objectively if their life depended on it. Off to their beloved gulags with them and into the cinema you go."
661,"I loved the movie, great actor great acting
It was soooooo good
Sad and depressive
But cool"
662,"I would consider myself an avid film fan and in my 37 years, I have been privileged to watch many classic films that have an x-factor and capture the zeitgeist at the time. Some films are just beautifully put together and the combination of image and sound work together to create something more than its parts.Joker has the x-factor and works almost perfectly as a film. Seeing as perfect doesn't exist, this is as good as it gets. Throw in a performance on a Daniel Day-Lewis level and you have something very special. It clearly draws from Scorsese's work in the 1970s (Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy etc) but also has a very relevant social commentary about mental illness, the rich/poor divide and shared responsibility.The critical backlash after the initial praise is strange, but feels like a concerted effort to distance themselves from a film that could be too hot to handle. However, the people clearly disagree and the universal praise is totally deserving.This is a transportative and transformative film that looks backwards to redefine a genre and create a gem of a film. It's dark, depressing and glorious all at the same time."
663,"See. Its been such a long time since there has been a movie which is not supposed to make you feel happy or just give you moments. I am so happy that I got to witness this and see it. It will hit your soul. It will make you ask questions. It will make you think so hard, which is something we don't get in movies anymore.
Also, even though this is called ""Joker"", I hope people don't forget about Arthur, because I think that's what's important. The journey of Arthur to whatever he becomes.
I am glad I am alive in 2019 to witness this masterpiece."
664,"Everyone is talking about how violent and disturbing this film is... well, what's violent and disturbing is the REAL WORLD out there!!! American politics must change!! That's the message!! That's the films critic to society!! Mental health needs to be addressed!! Guns must be regulated!!Congratulations to the team who make this masterpiece possible and without any doubt the best performance of Joaquín Phoenix in any roll and the best Joker characterization of all time."
665,"Firstly if you are a cinema fan and appreciate the way a story unfolds; camera angles; character development then GO and see this movie! You will enjoy it immensely.
Now I had high hopes for this movie. Phoenix is an incredible actor and all the early reviews looked great. What I wasn't prepared for was the emotional connection I had with such a dark piece of film. The way you are drawn in as a viewer to the plight of Joker's character is fantastic. The set created a real feel to a 'comic' movie which is often missing. The story is actually close to the bone when you look at modern society; this only adds to the brutality. Fantastic film with all the right elements and casting. You will hear people say this movie is too dark but that is the exact reason the movie works so well. I would be surprised if Phoenix was denied an Oscar nod. I would say this is the best movie of 2019 so far. Bravo to the team behind JOKER."
666,"One of the best movies this year and pay attention, this is not a super hero movie. Joaquin performance is outstanding but it's not as good as heath's one.
It's one of those movies that it's totally worth it to go see it on a cinema. The intense songs when gooes louder it makes a good and dark feeling into it. A fantastic movie, and an incredible performance by Joaquin."
667,"Joaquine Phoenix is a Gem when comes to this joker act,he definitely deserves Oscar award for this movie must watch movie"
668,"If I have to speak about acting after you have scrolled down the star cast section, I would do a disservice to the actors and the director.So, we would talk about the outstanding story, wonderful script writing, surprising cinematography and marvelous character development- things that we do not talk about that often.
This movie shows how you can make a Shawshank Redemption kind of film from a comic book character.Make Todd Phillips the creative head of DCEU and you will have more such masterpieces."
669,"This movie is nothing but showcase of Joaquin Phoenix acting skills. He took whole movie on his shoulders.
And That laugh. You will get goosebumps, everytime he laughs."
670,"I truely hope Joaquin Phoenix wins an oscar for this.
What an incredible performance.
The movie has a very dark atmosphere from the beginning til the end.
You also sympathize with the joker, you feel sorry for him.
This is not a hype, this is a masterpiece. Go and watch."
671,The ending gave me a straight minute of goosebumps the story is spot on the acting is just wow i cant rate this at 10 as it deserves more i hope we can get joker 2 with the same actor he was super great. Great movie with great music.
672,This movie is the one of the best movies I have ever seen
673,"The reasoning of the cruelty of the joker by which he killed people is not convincing.The colleague of the joker lent him a gun upon knowing that the joker was bullied. Joker could have shot at the sky above as warning and did not have to kill the people.When the colleague of the joker realised that he himself might get involved in the killing, it was the natural reaction that he denied the ownership of the gun.And even the TV host who once mocked the joker did not deserve to be killed.The matricide of the joker is totally unacceptable.It is wrong of the joker to kill innocent people indiscriminately."
674,"The moment the end credits where starting I had tears in my eyes and felt the urge to applaud, which is not happening in a cinema in Belgium ever! I hesitated but what a surprise: the whole audience started applauding and I could join anonymously...
I am a movie lover and 61. I must say that this is the most impressive movie I have ever seen. Pure melodrama. A true masterpiece."
675,"You're not supposed to relate to the Joker!
You're meant to realise that some people are in pain. That people that act strangely should not be mocked, their life might have been horrific.
Be kinder, be more tolerant. Don't help create a real life Joker."
676,"This movie defines the reality of pur society we r living in
Now a days people just enjoy movies like avengers based on action and fight but dont like movies which based on their lives and the society they r living in"
677,If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get an Oscar for this it will only be because Hollywood is too sensitive. Probably best portrayal of the Joker yet...even though I still love Heath Ledger's version. This is just on another level! Would only warn against seeing this if you can't handle disturbing images/violence/dialogue. I have seen some of the worst cinema has to offer and I still got nervous sweats and felt incredibly uncomfortable the whole way through. Good luck!
678,"Joaquin Phoenix literally changed the game with acting as the joker. Left the cinema in amazement. I was virtually nearly off my seat for majority of the movie, and the movie definitely relates to what is going on in the world right now."
679,If this movie is not recognised by the Oscars then the hope in great performances will be lost.
680,"Went to watch the movie as a Heath ledger fan, came out as Joaquin Phoenix biggest fan. Best perfomance I've seen for any character. The movie is a bit slow at times but thats how character building is done. The movie absorbs you in itself with each upcoming scene.Highly Recommended."
681,"This is not a simple movie , this is a masterpiece ! To see something like this in 2019 is was shocking . I never thought that in my life i would ever seen that kind of act . And i want to thanks Joaquin Pheonix and the entire crew for such a great lesson ,and for his incredible brain strenght ."
682,"I use IMBD ratings to decide which films to go to see at the cinema. When I saw that this film had a 9 rating I assumed that I was going to see an extremely good film. How wrong I was, the film was less than average. The film didn't get me emotionally involved in any way. I didn't feel sorry for the main character or any of the other characters that he murdered and none of the other characters in the film moved me in any way. It was a ""run of the mill"" film that I couldn't wait to end. The only good thing about it was that my 15 year old granddaughter enjoyed it."
683,"Just lost 2 hours of my life!
Just lost 2 hours of my life!"
684,"Saw Joker for the second time in a cinema to night, and I was still both entertained and amazed over this masterpiece......One of the best films for many years and just might the best performance by a leading actor since Taxidriver and still maybe even better....Joaquin must win the Oscar for that performance.... I was blown away by his portrail of Joker.Go see it for the first, second or maybe eight time👍😊"
685,"One of the best performances I've ever seen Joaqin phoenix truly deserves an oscar for this
.... besides the great acting and magnificent cast
Every thing else is very well done ( the directing the camera movement .... )
They've done there best to transfer the tragedy of the joker and make us sympathise him ."
686,"I can see many scenes of this movie becoming iconic.The scene on the stairs and the fabulous but creepy dance Joker makes as a way to release anxiety. I can see it become famous just like the Rocky Balboa jump or the ""I am the King of the World"" standing with the open arms from Titanic.I haven't seen a movie this good in ages; It is funny, it is creepy, its has suspense, it has violence, action. It is intense. It shows mental illness in a way very few movies have done it in the past.It has smart jokes and if you ever felt depressed or lonely in your life (which most people have), you will understand it much better.The movie has 2 hours but it feels like 20 minutes providing such intensity and hanging on the edge of the seat story lineJoaquin deserves an Oscar, so does the movie not only because its great but to encourage director and movies companies to invest in more movies like this.Don't listen to the ""critics"" about this movie, the people are loving it and the voice of the people is the voice of God. Critics they go in the opposite direction of the flow because they see themselves as being ""different"" and they want to be different by saying something else than what everybody says in a bid to make them look like they ""know"" more than everyone else. If everybody loves a movie, they will hate it. And if everybody hates a movie, they will love it. Its always the same thing.Everyone can be a critic nowadays, thanks to the internet. So don't listen to them anymore, its just an outdated way of reviewing movies and not one bit reliable anymore.Go watch Joker and jump to your own conclusions, I bet you won't regret watching it."
687,"We watched Joker tonight, and I expected good acting from Joaquin Phoenix, wasn't sure about the story and everything else but I was willing to see how it will go. What I didn't expect was that I wouldn't blink an eye throughout the movie. It was absolutely brilliant. Joaquin Phoenix didn't just give us good performance, but made Joker so real. Like he is one of us, and as my friend said - scary part was that you could relate to him and be on the same track with his thoughts. Everything is perfect in this movie - story, acting, photography, music... hell even the colors of this world are perfect. Joaquin Phoenix carried the whole storry on his back - it was an one man show that took all your attention, imagination, stirred all your feelings and emotions and left you speechless when The End letters came on the screen. The best movie this year for sure - Phoenix deserves Oscar for this one and any other reward he can get in this world. BRILLIANT!!!!"
688,"Greetings again from the darkness. The first thing to know is that this is not a Superhero movie. In fact, there are no heroes in the movie - unless you would like to apply the label to a single mom who lives down the hall from Arthur Fleck. Mr. Fleck lives at home with his invalid mother in a grungy, run-down apartment. He works as a clown-for-hire, dreams of becoming a stand-up comedian, and depends on social services to supply the 7 medications he takes since being released from Arkham State Hospital. It's a bleak existence at a bleak time in a bleak city. Gotham is in the midst of a garbage workers' strike (only the 'super rats' are happy), political upheaval, and a growing chasm between the classes. And then it gets worse for Arthur.The second thing to know is that this is a standalone Joker film, and one mostly unrelated or not connected to previous projects featuring the colorful Clown Prince character played (and voiced) by such memorable actors as Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, Mark Hamill, Jared Leto and even Zach Galifianakis. Director Todd Phillips (who co-wrote the script with Scott Silver) is best known for such extreme comedies as ""The Hangover"" franchise and OLD SCHOOL, so he's a bit outside of his usual wheelhouse. Phillips and Silver seem to embrace not just the history of the character, but also the look, texture and tone of filmmaking from an earlier era. The gritty and outcast feel of Scorcese's TAXI DRIVER and THE KING OF COMEDY is present, and so are numerous tributes to familiar Joker moments of days gone by.Three time Oscar nominee Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, and he delivers Arthur's slow descent into madness, or shall we say further descent. It's clear from the beginning that Arthur views himself as ignored by society, while all he wants to do is bring joy and laughter to others ... and be noticed. His daydreams or visions of himself in a better world send a strong message. Phoenix shows us what full commitment to a role looks like. He lost 50 pounds, leaving a frame that contorts, moves and dances in a manner unlike what we've seen before. In fact, it's a toss-up on which shows up more frequently, his dances moves or his maniacal, pained laughter. We are informed Arthur suffers from Pseudobulbar Affect, also known as emotional incontinence, which causes that creepy laughter to pop up at some inappropriate times. Of course, the comparisons to Heath Ledger's Oscar winning turn in THE DARK KNIGHT are inevitable. The roles and films are written quite differently, and it's safe to say both actors were all-in.Action sequences and special visual effects are both noticeably absent, but the violence is sure to shock. This is not one for the younger kids, no matter how much they enjoy THE AVENGERS or WONDER WOMAN (or any other DC or Marvel film). This gritty, visceral approach is often a tough watch, and is much more a character study of mental illness than a costume drama ... although Arthur's clothes and make-up are front and center. When Arthur states, ""I have nothing but bad thoughts"", we believe him. And the sympathetic back story explains a great deal, and will likely prove quite controversial.Phoenix dominates the film (as he should), and supporting work is provided by Robert De Niro as Murray Franklin, a TV talk show host in the Johnny Carson mode; Zazie Beetz (DEADPOOL 2) as the single mom neighbor Sophie Dumond; Frances Conroy as Penny Fleck, Arthur's mother; Brett Cullen as a not so empathetic Thomas Wayne; and Shea Whigham and Bill Camp as police detectives. I'll hesitantly mention that Dante Pereira-Olson makes a couple of brief appearances as an adolescent Bruce Wayne, and just for fun, we get a shot of the young man honing the batpole skills he will use later in life. Just don't expect any ""real"" Batman references.Director Phillips delivers a film that looks and feels and sounds much different than other comic book movies. Cinematographer Lawrence Sher is a frequent Phillips collaborator (all 3 Hangover movies) and the dark look and gritty feel are present in most every shot. Hildur Guonadottir (this year's Emmy winner for ""Chernobyl"") serves up a foreboding score - one that never overwhelms, and one that contrasts perfectly with the more traditional songs utilized throughout: Stephen Sondheim's ""Send in the Clowns"", Jimmy Durante singing ""Smile"", Cream's ""White Room"", ""That's Life"" by Frank Sinatra, and Gary Glitter's familiar ""Rock and Roll Part 1 and 2"". The ""Smile"" song is especially relevant as its origins can be traced by to Charlie Chaplin's MODERN TIMES, a silent movie classic featured in this film. Phillips even uses the Saul Bass designed Warner Bros logo to open the credits, making sure we understand the time period (no cell phones, etc).The film traces Arthur's slide into crime ... a transition that he wasn't seeking, and one that he believes was forced upon him. His rise as a savior to the working class is secondary to his own journey, and the chaos is handled on the perimeters of the film, preventing this from becoming a Super Villain movie. Keep in mind JOKER played at Venice, Telluride and Toronto - three prestigious festivals. This is just another thing that sets it apart from others in the genre. Despite the 1981 time stamp, the consistent anti-rich message and class disparity is prevalent throughout. This appears to be Phillips' way of including a contemporary theme in a decades-old setting. And it's a cautionary tale that there should be no clown left behind."
689,"That is one of the most aimless, predictable and shallow films I've seen. The only thing that made any sense was that it was somehow connected to the Batman universe. Joaquin's ability to portray a psychopath, although pointless, was ultimately decimated by the fact this was a Batman film. I can't really take it seriously because of that. There is no real social drama, it has no message and is full of fallacies. It doesn't raise any awareness. Dialogs when present were pathetic. All in all the Joker is neither a real film based on true events nor a fiction. It tries really hard to do both and it fails spectacularly."
690,"Movie of the year? Yes, actor of the year, but not the movie. Madness."
691,"Feels a bit like Requiem for a Dream meets Taxi Driver, but not nearly as good as either. Was there a single memorable script line or cerebral plot twist in the entire film? Not that I noticed."
692,"It's been a long time since I've been as unsettled by a movie as I was by ""Joker."" The last one I can think of that comes close was ""First Reformed"" from last year, another film that taps into some very dark and disturbing feelings about the state of our modern world. But that movie at least offered the possibility of hope if you were willing to interpret it a certain way, whereas ""Joker"" is about as damn near nihilistic as you can get.I didn't really even want to see this movie, because I'm sick to death of the whole superhero craze and our country's obsession with it. The Joker is one of the most overexposed of all villains, and I didn't give a rat's ass about his origin story. But the thing is, this is barely a movie about the Batman Joker. It's pretty clear that director Todd Phillips and actor Joaquin Phoenix can barely muster up the energy to tie this story into any greater mythology, and the few meager attempts to do so are the only times during the movie when my brain hit snooze and my attention drifted. The rest of the film is a deeply disturbing character study of a lone man who's so tired of trying to play by the rules of a system that has no place for him that he decides to make his own. I won't call Phoenix a revelation, because we all knew he could act, but holy cow does he do something special in this movie. This is Daniel Day-Lewis in ""There Will Be Blood"" territory we're talking about here, where the word ""acting"" seems inadequate to describe what's happening on screen.There's a lot of controversy swirling around ""Joker."" Is it irresponsible to make a movie that basically gives lonely, angry white men a justification to carry out violent acts? Is the film just an empty, soulless, and cynical attempt to cash in on people's love of Batman and the series' villains? Is the film just ripping off of other, better movies, like ""Taxi Driver"" and ""King of Comedy?"" I think people will see what they want to see in ""Joker."" Some will see a hero figure in Arthur Fleck, and will either love or hate the movie because of it. Some will think the film is deep and profound while others will think it has nothing to say. I personally don't know that the film has anything to say, but the history of movies is full of great films that haven't necessarily ""said"" anything. ""Joker"" is a reaction to our very troubled times, and I was able to empathize with the character of Arthur Fleck to a certain point without condoning all of his actions. He's a mentally ill man who wants to get help but doesn't know how, or who's the victim of a system that doesn't care about mentally ill people. Meanwhile, the system is run by a bunch of fat cats who only care about making themselves and their cronies richer, while life for the average American gets harder and harder. Toss in our country's obsession with violence in general and guns in particular, and people like Arthur Fleck will be the inevitable result. I didn't interpret the movie as a rallying cry for incels, and I don't think it glamorized violence at all. Leave it to the ""Mission: Impossible"" movies (just as one example) to do that, yet no one ever holds movies like that to task. But I do think that more people than not may find someone to relate to in Arthur Fleck, and maybe that's what's so unsettling. Like him, and like Howard Beale, another famous movie character who's fed up with the system, I'm mad as hell, and I don't want to take it anymore. Of course I will, because I'm a rational adult who understands that progressive change moves forward in fits and starts. But wouldn't it feel just a little bit good to say screw it all and burn down the whole mess?It will be interesting to see how my reactions to ""Joker"" change over time and after we've passed this specific cultural moment. Who knows, maybe I'll think it's silly and juvenile twenty years from now when I think back on the Best Actor Oscar Joaquin Phoenix is almost certain to win. But right now, there's not a movie I've seen recently that feels more relevant or urgent than this one, and the balls this film has makes everything else currently playing look like a made-for-T.V. movie by comparison.Grade: A"

694,"Not sure if the controversy of the film was justified. Have people forgotten taxi driver? This is nothing new and as a comic book film it falls flat. Phoenix is great in the role but there just wasn't enough to go on and it was a muddled mess. I expected so much more from all the hype this film had and maybe that's why I'm just not impressed by it. It's worth a watch for sure but with no sequel... ""THE END"" and no Batman film to incorporate it with, then honestly what was the point anyway?"
695,"It was well played film. Of course JF does his due diligence. However, people blew this up because thats all people do these days is talk about everything thats not real life. Was a good different spin on a DC comic movie. This was more of if Joker was though of outside of the DC world. I think since movie imagination and creativity has bern lost through cgi , we take a movie such as this and make a huge deal of it. So ehhh it was good but Stop with the hype."
696,"Didn't enjoy this in the cinema and I didn't enjoy it at home. It's not saying anything coherent about how we treat mentally ill people or what a coarse society can do to a person. The story is Nonsensical and relentlessly grim and, while I'm willing to suspend disbelief enough to buy a man in a bat suit, i can't suspend it enough To believe a person like fleck would be treated in the way his is treated. Am also meant to believe this guy is a criminal mastermind? Or perhaps that none of it happened except in his head? Whatever. It's pointless dross. People who think this is great clearly don't watch man at films."
697,"While we were at one of the only pre-screenings in my city, it has taken me a while to review this title, because I've been torn on it.Yes, Joaquin Phoenix, who has always been a veritable bastion of talent, was masterful in the role. Yes, Phoenix's portrayal of his character was riveting. Yes, the story was both gripping and also necessary, especially today when it seems that mental illness is running rampant. Yes, the tone was magnificently set within both the cinematic and art direction.What I have a problem with, is the way it tied into the Batman universe and particularly with what it had in common and what differentiated it from the
Jokers of the past. I still have problems making the two worlds merge."
698,"The acting is insane! phoenix is brilliant,the oscar is 100%!i really did not expect the movie so genius! great movies didn't need CGI to storm the box office!!"
699,"Pros are obviously Joaquin is amazing and the direction is competent and it's beautiful and I actually liked a lot of the changes they've made Bc it's an origins story. Cinematography= excellent. I love the grittiness, the swearing, the constant chain smoking, the blood, the scene in the apt when he murders the guy with the knife and lets the little man go was great, the girlfriend thing being all in his head was great, joaquins dancing was great....Cons= a lot of the writing was just lazy. He got away from murder way too easily (literally nobody was in the subway tunnel= needlessly convenient) the murders of 3 random punk kids starting a crazy movement of violence was unbelievable and stupid (they weren't important at all just 3 rich kids with no explanation?) although I liked the idea of Thomas Wayne being a bad guy pretty much every scene with him was stupid (the joker sneaks into the theatre so easily during the protests=stupid) the end where he gets murdered in the alley during the violence was really stupid and so lazy (the guy was running for mayor and had no body guards or anything= totally forced the Batman connection). I liked the themes but they were way too overt, like when he basically rants on tv about his mental illness before shooting Robert deniro... totally not like the joker at all... I don't care if it's supposed to be like that.. it could have been a lot more subtle and natural but wasn't... and finally, although it was gritty and dark... I feel like they were still way too careful and preachy... like I was expecting him to kill a lot more people and honestly hoping for it because that's what the joker does especially for his origin story! Everyone is obsessing over it and saying it's amazing but I really just think that it fell short on Way too many levels. Worth the watch and definitely more bold than most but could've been great and simply isn't."
700,"No one will ever say Joachin Phoenix didn't give his all, but if you watch enough loner-with-an-agenda film such as ""King Of Comedy"" or ""Taxi Driver"" you know where the pieces will fit.
The other thing is that the message of how society, in its neglect for the mentally ill will cause a rift in a population that is sick and tired of being sick and tired. In this case, where you identify with is where the Joker can get you. And empathize for what he must do. An achievement in making the unintentional sociopath that we see in all the movies. It's not without its charm. Granted, these dark misanthrope characters never bothered me...call me a dark person...there are sly nods at what is to be (a young Bruce Wayne sliding down a playset pole to greet Fleck was an especially nice one).
The other thing is what is known as anachronistic music and movies. Okay...having Cream and Gary Glitter and having Charlie Chaplin is no longer an alternate universe. It means Gotham is real and it kept having to readjust my mind that it wasn't New York City circa 1981. They either know our pop culture evolution or you don't.
The other thing...is that it still raises so many questions as to the Joker's history. A simple one of emotional betrayal by those he held close but can't exhibit closeness isn't going to work. The betrayal is meaningless. Which, unfortunately, is the ugliness of The Joker.
Who do you root for here. Thomas Wayne, the future tyrant capitalist, unwavering in a modicum of kindness who is a victim of rampant unrest between the rich and poor. Or the Joker, a product of the most sludge scraping bottom who does very little to further his lot in life other than to report to a menial job while being medicated to death? It's all ugly and there are no sunshine. That is NYC today...I mean Gotham. It's a perverse film that sets up larger ideas that seem to fizzle into an unnecessary overbearing notes of ""gee, isnt the music so different than what we see"" territory. Todd Phillips does an excellent job at capturing the time but look...it's either reality or it's not."
701,"I made an IMDb account just to write a review for this film and give it the 10 star rating it deserves. JP plays the role of Joker perfectly. Dark, disturbed, lonely, angry, he just nails every aspect and his performance in this film just has to be seen. He 100% has to win the best actor Oscar when awards season arrives. I was hooked from the very first scene and was enthralled throughout. What an outstanding piece of cinema. Amazing. The best film I have seen in a long, long time."
702,This is one of the best movies ever. What a great performance by Joaquin Phoenix (Oscar winner) Todd Philips is genius (Oscar winner). Everything about this movie is just perfect.
703,It was masterpiece. This movie there just like once in years. DC once again make another good quality movie after dark knight. And I've watch it on theatre more than twice. Beautiful. Beautiful.
704,"This is one of the movies that you watch and end up thinking about for a while after.
It's very rare that a movie makes you truly terrified and yet understanding of why this villain is the way he is.
The acting is absolutely incredible, hats off to Joaqin Phoenix for this legendary performance.
The soundtrack was haunting, eerie, and heavy. Hildur Guðnadóttir's choice of using cello as the main instrument allowed for a very dark and churning sound that perfectly captures the turmoil inside of Arthur. Bravo!
The cinematography is breathtaking, the visuals are stunning, and combined with the meticulous directing and attention to detail, the final product ends up being a true masterpiece."
705,Joaquin Phoenix is going to win the Oscar for best actor at the 2020 Academy Awards.
706,"I was super excited for this movie ever since I heard Joaquin Phoenix was playing the Joker, I was not disappointed. The best Joker portrayal to date in my opinion A++++"
707,"It's not possible to say everything about this masterpiec. but i can say this and insure you that It's not only the time in the theatre you spend, you will keep thinking about this movie after you walks out even for a very long time."
708,"This is not your typical comic book movie. No superpowers, superheroes or end-of-the world scenarios. In fact, there's not really any modern special effects. If the ""Joker"" wasn't one of a most culturally recognizable villains, this movie may not have the wide impact it's having.However - he is a central character in the DC comic universe. This movie gives him a plausible, wildly dark and often sad origin story. This would not be the same movie without Phoenix's eccentric performance. He made it disturbing and believable. If he wins the Oscar for lead actor, it will be the second time someone won an Oscar for being the Joker (the other being Heath Ledger in 2009).The story may hit a deep note with many people who've felt disenfranchised, alienated or ignored by society or their families. For 2 hours, I felt drawn into the world and crazed reality of the main character, Arthur Fleck (aka Joker). For that - I have to say it was a compelling watch."
709,"Personally I was not ready for the intensity and the realistic nature of Jokers mental health. This version of Joker stands on its own and should not be compared to DC or Marvel. It's a Drama. I have never had a ""Comic Book"" movie give way to all the emotions I felt, questioning every part of humanity and how we treat each other makes a difference. I applaud this movie for asking hard questions. Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic. It's a 10 stars in my book."
710,"Non apologitic , in your face kind of revolutionary evolution of the Joker character . Deeply visceral violence that only contribute to the story and don't develope without reason ."
711,"This movie is beautiful. Phoenix gives a great performance. So why such a low rating? Because this movie is so obviously derivative of Taxi Driver and King of Comedy that Phillips acknowledged it by casting De Niro. But that is not its worst offense. The worst offense is that it ultimately signifies nothing. Since we have an unreliable POV of what actually transpires, after we are shown that Arthur fantasizes his romantic relationship, which was played as real, and his initial appearance on the Murray Franklin show, which was presented falsely in a stylized manner, we don't have any means to discern what was just hallucinations and what was intended to be fact.But who cares? Was Arthur a misunderstood comic genius, a doting son, a vigilante for subway justice, a disowned spawn of a heartless titan of industry, a nurturing lover to a lonely single mother? We don't know the veracity of any interaction in the entire runtime of this movie because nothing is clearly real or false for us to invest our care.Phoenix gives an awesomely weird performance nonetheless. That, and the impeccable production design, is all this movie has going for it. That is what elevates this from being a complete ripoff of better filmmakers and a totally pointless endeavor. Still, the financial success of this movie baffles me. Why do comic fanboys love to see the death of Batman's parents replayed ad nauseam? What insight did this provide into either iconic character which hadn't already been alluded to in more artful ways? I'm hard pressed to find any need for this other than to cash in on the comics movie zeitgeist. It has definitely been successful in that regard."
712,It's great. Just wow. Yes it was violent but it was less violent than John wick and Deadpool.
713,"I had heard bad reviews from critics on this film but after deciding to go see the film, I do not regret seeing it one bit. The story telling of this film is something the film industry is lacking these days."
714,"I always thought of Joker as a evil demonic clown who loves terrorizing people to get his rocks off.And I always wanted to see a really cool back story for him to see what turned him evil but this just blew me away.never ever has a movies protagonist/antagonist made me feel so weird inside how is it it possible someone can be so evil and yet we can sympathize with him ,such a weird feeling I can't stop thinking of it.Brilliant cinematography ,score ,acting ,story ,twists & everything.10/10"
715,Really good plot and GREAT acting just extremely dark
716,"This movie has to be one of the best acting performances I have ever seen. Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar, without a doubt. The amount of work that he put into this film paid off. Such a dark and creepy movie. Will definitely be going back to theaters to rewatch. Loved it!"
717,This is a joke not joker a hero turned into a villian come on the guy was sick joker is a physho a legend he just do things this movie is all about loosers who takes things personally .the body language style motives practical jokes nothing matched joker's personality. This is not joker's menatlity hope there is no sequel if ur a joker pls dont waste ur time on this crap this crap is clown not a joker
718,"I read the reviews about this film, and went to see this movie expecting a psychological masterpiece, filled with nuance and emotional depth, and I left the film feeling mentally violated. If I had to paint this film in generalized strokes, I'd sum it up as a malignant tumor on the collective psyche of our generation.The film starts up showing Arthur - a pathetic, fragile man with an obviously low IQ. He gets beat up in the first 10mins of the film by a gaggle of teenagers, who on their way out of the alley call him ""weak"". Throughout the film he continues to portray himself as weak, up until the point he gets his hands on a gun. Then you see him staring to feel 'empowered', and by that I mean, he dances half naked with the gun shooting a hole in his wall, then gets brazen and takes it to work for which he gets fired as a result. On his way home he shoots three guys, who also decide to beat him up (you gotta start wondering why is everyone out to get this guy). He gets into an imaginary relationship with a neighbor. Kills his mom, cause guess what? His mom turns out to also be a bad guy. He then kills his coworker, who was also a 'bad guy', and then goes on a talk show with host who he's been fangirling over throughout the film, and then kills him on air, because guess what? He was also a bad guy!This film is 2-dimensional at best. There is no emotional depth WHATSOEVER. Joaquin, for all the solid acting (at times overacting) that he does, and I'm sure a significant part of it was method (the guy starved himself for the role, so I give him props for that) does not even for a moment show any likeability as a character. He is flat, entirely unempathetic from the start of the film, and has no thoughts or feelings of his own to relay to the audience. Everything in the film happens to him, he makes no decisions. He just acts, and flatly for that. Everyone around him is equally flat - all the rich people are insensitive pigs, and all the poor people are violent anarchists. He is grotesque and detestable throughout the entire film. Most of the film is uncomfortable and some flat out unbearable to watch (if you're not a psychopath).What's most disturbing though, is the reaction this film gets from some members of the audience. a couple of people in the audience were laughing at the parts where he killed, and right after. The one part where the little man tries to leave his apartment, one girl next to me fell into laughter at that. This little 'comedic' tidbit was tossed in there right after a gruesome murder.The reason I categorize it as a malignant tumor, is because this film and films like it desensitize the audience to grotesque violence, and rationalize senseless acts of violence for those already lacking in the empathy department. They paint a picture of a bleak, cold and uncaring world that ""makes monsters out of down on their luck folks"". The film desperately tried to add a psychological element to this character, and failed tremendously. The mental illness he had was not properly portrayed. The DC Joker is a Malignant Grandiose Narcissist with Antisocial Personality Disorder, Arthur, however, is a vulnerable narcissist with what I'm guessing was supposed to be a variation of Tourette's. His narcissism is poorly portrayed, it only rears its ugly head once he kills and feels nothing about it. But narcissism is more than just that. Instead of showing other elements of malignant narcissism, the director decided to bombard the audience with grotesque shots of his malnourished, mostly naked body dancing for the purpose of making the audience uncomfortable. I'm guessing that was intentional, so that the film could be seen as ""edgy, dark and artisitc"".So many reviewers on this site call this garbage a masterpiece, simply because it was disturbing to watch and makes the viewer squirm during a few scenes. Let me tell you, just because something makes you squirm or makes you want to gag, that doesn't make it good, or signify exceptional acting or directing. I would squirm just as much if I saw a video of a swarm of bugs crawling on a carcass, and that doesn't require any acting or directing.The only reason I gave this film 2 stars instead of 1, was because of Joaquin's effort. Everything else was horrid, static and two-dimensional."
719,"'Joker (2019)' is one of the most intense and disturbing films I've seen in a long time. It really is surprisingly fantastic, an unsettling and complex character-study that's as uncompromising as it is gripping. Inspiration was clearly taken from 'The King Of Comedy (1982)' and, to a lesser degree, 'Taxi Driver (1976)', but this isn't just a cut-and-paste copy. It's very much its own beast, as much a horror movie as it is a comic-book one. Don't let Phillips fool you, by the way, this certainly is a comic-book movie. It's a phenomenal comic-book movie that blows almost all others out of the water, but a comic-book movie nonetheless. It takes inspiration from several well-known storylines and has a firm grasp on both its titular character and all the other classic Gotham elements, much more so than one might expect given the marketing. None of this is meant as a slight, just an exploration of the fact that comic-book movies are ""real"" movies. Here, we have a probable career-best performance from Phoenix, who's often frightening even when sitting still, and a definite career-best directorial effort from Phillips, who seems to have elevated himself far beyond the generally well-regarded 'The Hangover (2009)'. The whole thing is just so well-made, clearly crafted with absolute clarity of vision from the very beginning. The screenplay is great, the cinematography is gorgeous and the musical score is outright masterful. The flick works so well because it doesn't pretend there are 'heroes and villains'. You don't really identify with the protagonist, you pity him. You want him to be okay, to find a way out of his inevitably dark situation, but certainly aren't cheering along with him when things eventually get even worse. There's no 'good guy', just a guy. He undergoes some serious trauma and, often, the piece elicits a strong emotional response when this happens. Yet, when he decides to deal with it in a criminal way, you're never 'on his side'. Instead, you just watch in shock and horror, glued to the edge of your seat. Indeed, the violence here is some of the most impactful I've seen, each moment punching you straight in the gut. It's not fun, it's horrible and that's how it should be. There's no doubt that this is an amazing feature. It's absolutely gripping and I can't stress that enough. It gets under your skin and wriggles around, as interesting to reflect on as it is to watch. It's not exactly 'nice' but it's not supposed to be. It's brave, realistic stuff that's easily up there, right at the top, as one of the best of the year. As a footnote, I just can't believe how well they incorporated the Joker's classic laugh into a piece as grounded as this; it's chilling, tragic and integral to the character, yet still as over-the-top as you'd think (though, you might not realise it when it happens). Honestly, I still can't quite comprehend how good this whole affair is. It's simply divine. 9/10"
720,"The movie JOKER, which had its world premiere at Venice 2019 and won the Golden Lion best film award on the Lido, has been mistakenly termed a ""comic book film"". True it is in a sense spinoff from the comic book based Batman film series, however, this is a serious non-comic book psychological study of how a would be stand-up comedian with a pathetic laughing syndrome goes wrong and becomes a psychotic killer. Joaquin Phoenix, 44, with his astounding interpretations of this peculiar character has now clearly established himself as the new king of Hollywood and even knocks off one of the old kings, Robert De Niro, in a short but telling sequence.
Basically this is a speculative account of how a notoriously evil public enemy, later to be known as ""The Joker"", started out as an innocent clown who loved his mother but was the victim of a ""condition"" (uncontrollable laughter) which made him a societal outcast and eventually warped his mind. His first killing which was basically in self defense when brutally attacked by three ""respectable"" men in a metro car is interpreted by the media as unmotivated murder because only we in the audience saw the brutal kicking attack. The irony is that the gun he pulled on them was given him by a fellow clown to use only in self defense. It turns out that his widowed mother has dark secrets of her own (which will peripherally connect us with the future Batman) but Phoenix as wannabe comedian ""Arthur Fleck "" (what a spotty name!) takes this role to the outer limits of the twilight zone as his frenzied laughter becomes more and more menacing. His constant disclaimer is ""I have a condition"" -- and what a condition it will turn out to be! -- culminating in his live on TV shooting of a Jay Leno type talk show host (De Niro) who, fascinated by his personality has invited Fleck to appear as a special guest. Not enough can be said of Joaquin Phoenix's bravura performance and the end result of this masterful film (Kudos to director Todd Phillips as well) is to shock you out of your pants. But a kind of shock that is exhilarating in the cinematic artistic and social sense."
721,I could've gone to a psychiatric clinic to watch somebody acting randomly instead of watching this movie that doesn't make sense at all.once i finished the movie i was like what the was the movie about??
722,"Joaquin Phoenix is a good actor but I think now he become a legend.
A nice movie with a great act of a great actor.
An unforgettable movie."
723,Beautifully acted and beautiful story.Refreshing to watch compared to most films in 2019.
724,Rate this a 10 because people have been giving it 8's and 9's without stating what was wrong with it because there isn't anything wrong with it and it deserves to be above 9 stars.
725,"Do not let the matacritic score fool you ! It is comprised of people who are quick to label the film edgy jusy because it touches on social matters, people who in my opinion should not be able to publish a movie rating as professionals. Everything that has to do with The Joker is done in a perfect way. Not only is phoenix's performance astonishing but the cinematography and climate of the film are perfect. It is truly a drama that makes an excellent background story for the character and has you on your heels everytime Joaquin is on the screen. Plus the violence felt very impactful and carried a message instead of simply being a way to make the film more intense."
726,I almost didn't go to see this as I've always had a problem viewing movies that have so hyped. But to be honest this is one movie worth seeing. I have been a total fan of Heath Ledgers Joker since it came out but to be fair this is worthy of being right up there with it. Phoenix's Joker is mesmerising and I found it hard to look away no matter how difficult the situation. I felt a lot of things during this performance and didn't need the whole box and dice of CGI trickery to get me there! Just stunning performances by all concerned. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone
727,"Heath ledger would be so proud!
It was amazing! Blew my mind ! I will watch it again and again !
After a long time finally a good movie ! Enjoyed every second with every cell of my body !"
728,"A long time i did not enjoy and get marveled by a film.
If the decition depend on me, I said, Oscar to Best Film, And Oscar to Best Leading Role to Joaquin Phoenix, there is no equal, One of the most difficult role to perform in movies history and its overwhelm by Joaquin. You must see this film an prepear to see masterful performance in every detail."
729,"Never before have I felt the need to write a review, but this film was amazing, weird, sad, brilliant, and it may make you question a few things in life, plus you may need to watch it more then once to truly understand what the hell you have just watched. GO SEE THIS MOVIE."
730,"Every year I deal with one issue - less new movies that deserve to be called art. But Joker is a rare example of what you can call art in every way. The creators of this movie made 2019 successful by making Joker, making the viewer feel wide range of emotions that push us beyond borders of standard perception. Thank you for this piece of art, a gift for all of us who create new perceptions and new visions."
731,"It's been reported that some people found the level of violence so graphic they have walked out of the showing..I can understand why. It's inexcusable that they did as they missed the ultimate tale in morality and their lives will be poorer for that fact.If you expect to see a bells and whistle CGI extravagance, you'll be disappointed. If, like me, you want a psychonautical joyride into the creation of the character of Joker.. open yourself to the lesson you're about to receive.Joaquin's portrayal is by far the superior version and most credible I have watched to date and his is a performance, I feel, cannot be surpassed, and should not, as here is the ultimate lesson of the nature of humanity - a poignant tale of human kindness and the consequences when that chain fails.. there are always repercussions for that imbalance and in the Joker, we see the deepest, darkest, most tragic and twisted sequence of consequences that should be a wake up call for us all, particularly now with the social injustices that are now common place. A Joker is reflected in each dispossessed person and we are many.A genuine masterclass in acting by Phoenix. The collaboration between Todd Phillips and Scott Silver is sheer brilliance."
732,"Regardless of whether you like it or hate it, I think the film explores how the Joker is the way he is because he can't be otherwise, literally. One of the greatest dangers to America itself is American culture. It's not terrorism that will destroy America; it's American culture that will ultimately be the undoing of America. The film looks to examine our distorted points of view or detachments from reality and show us that WE, as a society, have the same characteristics of the Joker. The Joker is a product of this materialistic culture we live under. Epistemically western culture is motivated by striving for money, status and recognition, which is focused on results and efficiency but that can have severe consequences because you're always judging yourself with the person next to you.The movie Joker is what you get when you take American culture, and you take it to its pinnacle. When you exaggerate it to the extreme, you get someone like the Joker. But the critical hidden message is that we need to become more aware of our OWN double standards within ourselves. We need to start to empathize that we have the same mechanisms as the Joker has. So, on the one hand, I can criticize the Joker, but on the other side, I can also see why he acts the way he does, but more importantly see it collectively. Notice that trying to rid the world of evil only creates more evil. Everything you might criticize; corporate greed, different beliefs, religion, people you dislike, violence, war, mass shootings, even just hating this movie - We like to criticize things, but while we're criticizing, we're NOT really thinking about how we ourselves are part of the very same problem that is contributing to the cycle."
733,"I really liked the way heath ledger portrayed joker in dark knight. Funny, cunning, evil. If he was living today, he would have aced this movie. But surprisingly, Joaquin does it even better. He is rarely funny but very alone and pathetic. His condition becomes worse and worse until he breaks out, wreaking havoc to Gotham. The story flows smoothly through Arthur's life, how the situation around influences him to become the joker. The supporting characters including Robert de Niro have done an excellent job but nobody can beat Joaquin. He was at a completely different level!! A pure masterclass of cinema. If you are a fan of joker, don't miss this one! Another Oscar worthy performance from Joaquin. If he gets it, it ll be second time for the same role."
734,"How is this boring ""movie"" get so many 10 is beyond me"
735,"I dislike this movie, although I do not deny the great performance of Joaquin Phoenix. I extremely dislike the ways to send the genuine message about mental illness: unrealistically ugly graffiti everywhere on/in the bus and buildings, unreasonable intensified music here and there, over-centered crime scenes, unrealistic incapable/stupid police, weird development of psychiatric disorders, unbelievable reaction of the society to the crime behaviors... all of them make me extremely uncomfortable rather than enjoying the show."
736,"The first hour is a boar with too much emphasis upon protraying what we already know...the Joker is crazy. Two senseless murders, one too graphic.
Hopefully the sequel will be better.
Good acting by Jaquine."
737,"Absolutely awful script, oscar nominations you got to be joking unless they give Oscars for the most boring film made. It was on par for the worst portrayal of the joker with Jared Leto."
738,"Lackluster, boring, slow paced. The hype is exaggerated. The cinematography is overhyped because of a dark color theme and random angles. Unfortunately the angles always had joker in the center and the story was a try hard fail. A very predictable movie."
739,"Bad acting, bad CG, and the story is just pathetic. Apparently the ability to laugh, smoke, lose weight and put on make up means great acting. Worst movie of the year, hands down."
740,"There is nothing that makes this a movie about a super villain. He isn't a criminal mastermind and there is nothing in this movie to make it fantastical enough that you would believe Batman could exist.
That leaves a 2 hour film about a guy with mental health issues, delivered with a subtlety that would put Michael Bay to shame.
This film pounds you with its message or lack thereof like Batman smacking Joker's head off a desk.
Pitiful."
741,"Gotham City. Arthur Fleck works as a clown and is also an aspiring stand-up comic. He has mental health issues, part of which involves uncontrollable laughter. Times are tough and, due to his issues and occupation, Arthur has an even worse time than most. Over time these issues bear down on him, shaping his actions, making him ultimately take on the persona he is more known as...Joker.Great drama. While the movie fits into the Batman universe, and this could easily be seen as a prequel to Joker's character in The Dark Knight (where Joker was played superbly by Heath Ledger), this is not a comic-book movie. If it was a comic-book movie, it would have ended up another one in a long, seemingly endless line of them, one hardly discernible from the next.No, this is a human/psychological drama, and a very good one. Writer-director Todd Phillips creates a dark, depressing world with Arthur Fleck one of its primary casualties. The slow, inevitable progress of Arthur Fleck from innocent man to master-criminal is an interesting journey as Phillips rachets up the tension.What was then required was a performance that captured that darkness, helplessness and gradual disintegration and Joaquin Phoenix gives that, perfectly and spectacularly. Spot-on casting and delivery.Not quite the perfect movie though. Pacing was a bit off: some scenes seem dragged out too long. I know Phillips was drawing it out to create tension and atmosphere, but on a few occasions it feels like he overdoes it.It is also difficult, from a point, to be sympathetic towards Arthur Fleck. You start out supporting him, feeling that he is a victim rather than a villain, but, as his actions become more extreme, that engagement wanes.The story also feels like it is missing something to make it 100% complete. No, I'm not expecting this to link in with The Dark Knight. In fact, many of the Batman references actually seemed unnecessary, more there for audiences to gasp and say ""Oh, so that's how Joker fits in with Batman"", rather than adding anything to this story. A few scenes beyond the final scene might have been in order, to see more of Joker's history.Overall, still a great movie though."
742,"First 50 reviews are like: ""best movie ever"", ""masterpiece"", ""legend"". And you know what? 99% of these comments (and other 10/10 comments) are paid comments or from microworkers. Real rating for this movie would be 4.5 up to 5. Every single person who watched this movie in cinema told me that movie is boring and nothing special. Only on the internet you can see fake reviews as part of their marketing.
Joker in this movie is nothing like real Joker we know. I mean acting is good, but writting is bad.
He was dissapointed in society, nobody pay attention to him, so he start crying, dancing and killing. That's literally all in this movie. Cringe every second minute. And movie is sloooow to the bones...
Ratings are totally irrelevant because fake reviews are part of the movie."
743,"Perfect movie with a great storyline.
The actor was amazingly skilled and the camerawork was very well done in the scenes where it mattered the most. Best movie 2019."
744,"I was have been anticipating this one for awhile and watched every trailer and clip and couldn't wait then read the critics reviews and was a little disappointed but still excited to see it and thank God i did! I don't know how critics have jobs cuz this movie was absolutely INCREDIBLE! OUTSTANDING performance by Phoenix, intense storyline, and the soundtrack was the cherry on top! Best movie i have seen in years!!!"
745,"I went in for the second time for this movie because of how blown away I was the first time and how bone-chilling the experience was, the second time was no different it only made me appreciate the movie even more. An absolute must see, one of the greatest movies ever made in the 21st century with one of the greatest acting performances of all time by Joaquin Phoenix since heath ledger in the dark knight! Truly the best acting in the history of cinema! (10/10)"
746,"This movie blew me away. I was very hyped and excited for it, but I kept myself distant from the trailers and clips. Joaquin Phoenix is a now certified LEGENDARY actor!!! Jesus he was amazing in this movie, and delivers probably the greatest solo acting performance since heath ledger in the dark knight. I will admit the movie was a bit slow but I was easy to forgive since this is a character study kind of movie and it does say a lot about society. I won't go into deep specifics in this review but you'll know when you see it. I thought the cinematography was stunning of a run down Gotham City, the score was thrilling and mesmerizing. I can't get it out of my head, I just simply can't. I highly highly recommend this movie if you favor great acting and if you want your mind to be blown. Thank you for your time."
747,"First let me start by saying that this is the least ""comic""-book movie made. There aren't any big and bombastic fight scenes, no set-up for sequals. This is a piece about a man who has been abused his entire life and finally decides to snap and do something about it. I know it is easy to get lost in todays world and the way that people treat this movie is unfair. It's not a political piece, it's not a movie about the ""good sides of violence"" (as some people have called it). It is a movie about a man struggling to find love, job and joy in his life. And Arthur's transformation in the famous Joker is beautifully done. When the movie starts you can see how uncomfortable and awkward Arthus is but by the end (the last 20 minutes when he is actually the Joker) you see everythyng has changed. His movement, the way he talks, his actions and you just see how in control he is.
They way the violence is done in this movie has something personal to it. There are comments about how violent and gory it is. Complete lies, movies like Logan and Deadpool are way move brutal than Joker.
And now of course the star of the movie JOAQUIN PHOENIX. Oh man was he amazing. From his first line to his last you can see feel everything he feels (anger/passion/fear). And the way he handles the role is perfecr, other actors would have chosen to go big and scream a lot and use ""scary"" voices. But not him, he is tame and you can tell he has done his homework.
Overall I did not have any major problems with The Joker. I think it is beautiful, frightening, intense and it fully immersed me in the rotting world of Gotham.
10/10
Words can't do it justice so just go and see it with your own eyes."
748,"Amazing hype and outstanding performance for Phoenix, now I feel bad for the Joker. It's not an aggressive play like I heard, it's all about action & reaction for a society which is full of haters & madness."
749,"I am typically a fan of what Marvel has done, and initially saw no point to this movie when it was announced and couldn't see Phoenix doing the role justice, particularly after Heath Ledger's brilliant take on the Joker.
How wrong was I? This movie starts slowly, and draws you into Arthur's world without you realising it until you can't look away from the screen for fear of missing a single second of it. It is raw, it is personal, it is disturbing, it is sad, and it is deeply resonant of some of the troubles we are experiencing today in the world. This is the Joker, arch-nemesis of Batman, yet you feel empathy for him, and can't completely disagree with his actions. He only hurts those who he perceives hurt him, even if his justice is fatal and doesn't befit the crime. ""Wrong me, and you are dead,"" is not justice, and each of his victims display their own weaknesses and frailties, and aren't inherently bad people.
This is a brilliant movie. One of the few I went back to the cinema to watch again. It deserves Oscar recognition for Phoenix, Todd Phillips, cinematography, and the score.
Congratulations all round!"
750,The only thing that bugged me is Joker's make up lol
751,"A very dark movie with superb Acting and Cinematography. I felt all kinds of emotions all throughout the film. Laughter, Pity, Aggression, and finally validation for Arthur fleck towards the end. I can't wait for how they will develop a sequel to this story."
752,"The film is a single flea: kitchen psychology for simple minds. I find it incomprehensible why this movie has such good ratings.
But, if you look at most of the prosiele, you can see that many here have rated the Joker as the only movie, which could perhaps point to a targeted launch of the studios. The director would have to be trusted, he has served shamelessly in the film on successful motifs of earlier cult films, but without their cult to do justice. No, this movie is bad, boring and predictable. If Ledger had given the joker something more mysterious, this film served everything on the silver tray, and so paltt that it is yawning. Film should leave the space for imagination free, as the Joker generally stands for. And yes, Phoenix does a good job. But is it really a theatrical performance to distort your body like that? For me, the whole thing was almost too much, even his laughter and triggered in me rather a Guidance of Fremdscham, - but not because of the role, but to aim a bit overacting, the ""too much"", the film and the philosophy the director generally seems to have been. Which was also because the movie Phoenix gives little room for character development, which is not on arduous paths. Whenever a point is reached where Phoenix could lend the scroll a little magic, and lift it above the stupidly conceived character, the movie switches to the next scene to tell us more about its stupid geckoes. No, Joker could only make me yawn, and at the same time a horror, a must-have, how stupid people can be, how easy it is to keep up with old copied stories."
753,"One of those rare instances where the critics were more accurate in their ratings than the general public was. 8.7/10 rating on IMDb, 92% of people liked the movie... It's absolutely egregious, and goes to show how far people's film standards have plummeted. ""Joker"" is objectively one of the absolute worst films of the year, with nothing short of a hack writer attempting to mimic Scorcese's brilliance.There are several Scorcese films that I could use as examples to properly convey how identical this story's formula is compared to those, but I think the most obvious one is ""The King of Comedy."" It's such a blatant ripoff that people should steer clear from Joker and just go watch that one. It's the same viewing experience, but you'll come out of it feeling like you didn't lose any brain cells, which is a win in anyone's book, unless you pride yourself on your ability to flip your brain on/off like a light switch, which is something totally outside my scope of capabilities.Unlike most moviegoers, I enjoy paying attention to the story, and this story makes me want to shoot myself in the head. Not because it's depressing, but because the screenplay is so awfully predictable and totally devoid of realism that even attempting to place myself in the shoes of those who enjoyed it makes my soul weep. In spite of that, movies like this will continue to be made and accrue millions and millions of dollars, and people will continue to somehow find the relatability in films made by people so far up their own asses that they have totally lost a grip on reality.
P.S. If you want to watch a movie that truly deserves all the recognition it can get, go watch ""The Lighthouse."" There's your recommendation for the day from someone who's had enough of rehashed Hollywood garbage."
754,"One of the best movies of ALL TIME! The final image is as powerful as cinema gets and marks JOKER as a modern masterpiece. Everything about this film has a surreal, visceral, in-your-face quality; the anguished, violent intensity of it all. Everything in the film has a greater, more universal meaning, and it's not rocket science to figure out what stands for what. The simplicity of its metaphors doesn't dull the impact as a sensory experience, though, because it's still pretty potent stuff. Provided you're not completely close-minded, this is one you'll remember for a long, long time."
755,A must watch movie of 2019. Joaquin Phoenix was at top notch. Don't know who could do much Better. Overall twist in the Climax doesn't stick properly with the movie. Camera works and Music were awesome.
756,The plot could've been a little more defined BUT Joaquin is phenomenal. Flawlessly done. He deserves every award possible for his performance.
757,"First, I really love Joaquin Phoenix as an actor. I think he is clearly underrated. Second, he have had an amazing career before Joker's role, just check IMDB. Last, if you want to enjoy an amazing acting masterclass, this movie is for you.
To sum up, I didn't read anything about Joker's movie and the hype is real, in my opinion. Do not trust haters, just watch it, and enjoy real cinema. I'm still listening Joker's laugh inside my brain. Amazing."
758,"10/10. Not gonna say much! FBI, CIA, NSA all are on the lookout for Joker reviews in social media. Literally!!Joaquin Phoenix is winning the Oscar. Said and sealed."
759,"Im not sure whether I enjoyed the movie, but it left me with themes to think. Whether everything happened as a delusion or in reality,is a question. The actor's talent is best reflected through character. But its hard to justify giving death as punishment. Still a lot more to think about even after finishing watching movie."
760,"Tbh I have only one thing to say about this movie,
""Justice have been served"""
761,"This movie is so incredibly well done that I am writing a comment on IMDb for the first time. I truly have no words, or more like I want to say so many things that I dont even know where to begin.
Please watch it if you havent already, its the best thing you'll watch in a long time."
762,"Joaquin Phoenix is excellent, this is the best movie you will see this year.
This movie is a visual treatise on mental heath, abuse and social marginalisation. It has not much to do with DC and the fictional character. It perfectly explores how a human being can unravel into a sociopath. They could have easily called it 'Making a madman' or something.Not sure why they picked the 1980s but it worked well, the music is excellent and quite diverse in parts. Grimy downtrodden NY/Gotham looks awesome and suits the story.Heath Ledger was excellent previously but this film is rooted in brutal reality and it is so different to everything that came before that it is justified as a standalone masterpiece."
763,Saw this movie in the after noon the week after it's release. Yea very disturbing and unsettling but what do you expect from a movie that has a mentally psycho clown in the front and center? I freaking loved every minute of this movie. Even Gotham looked fantastic and I think this is the best looking Gotham ever. Sorry Chris Nolan even though you made the best Batman films. Phoenix really sold it. His portrayal of the Joker was completely realistic and all of his laughs were so well done. The story was great as well. I highly recommend this film
764,"Overall, the acting is the best part of the movie. Most of all Joaquin, but also Di Niro and the wonderful Frances Conroy (big fan).
However, several skills of the Joker were left out, f. e. top strategist or excellent chemist. What was left is a so-and-so comedian bordering on looser turning into a psychopath. And please, the cliche of bad childhood and the mother did him wrong, etc.... Worth a big Joker laugh.
I also missed the grand finale, maybe Arthur is using the raids to increase them, creating chaos, etc.
In the end it is a good movie about the Character development from looser to psycho. Not new, but well done and acted. For me it is just not the title character.I will be happy if Joaquin might get an Oscar or Frances as supporting actress, but can't see the movie deserving more awards.About the often in the media mentioned brutality... Well brutal behavior in a movie about a psychopath.... Wow... I am shocked... Who would have thought... *end sarcasm* 😂"
765,"What do you get when you cross a Perfect Actor and Excellent Director
I'll tell you what you get...
You get a Oscar worthy masterpiece!"
766,"This is such an important film. Not just for an amazing look into the depths of a character we know little about but also for awareness of how we act around others and mental illness. A great film; dark, twisted and a story that's beautifully told and shot. An abolute masterpiece of modern cinema."
767,"For years is No Country for Old Men my #1 movie of all time. Anton Chigurh still makes me freak out every time he flips his coin. Is not different in this movie.
Actually I have the same feeling watching Joker and the second time I went to the movie it felt like it was even faster ended, which is a good thing.
Jomer is raw, painfull and has a very good message to the world. If you don't get your eyes opened after watching this, it can be the other critics got their message right, which is to not let you see what's going on 'til today.About No Country for Old Men: it still has a special place in my heart, but I am pretty sure Joker will stay as #1 for a long time."
768,"Despite the fact that I went into this film with very high expectations I was still blown out of the water. Joaquin was amazing, the cinematography was outstanding and the writing was so perfectly linked to Christopher Nolan's batman trilogy. How this is rated poorly by critics blows my mind it clearly shows that critics are biased. Some bad reviews spoke about how the film was too dark and sadistic but that's merely the whole point of joker. He portrays a sadistic psychopath who has been pushed around in an unforgiving place and causes him to rebel. 10/10 best film of the year."
769,"Joker
2019

director : Todd Phillips
starring: Joaquin phoenix,Robert de niro, Zaze beetz,Frances Conray,Brett Cullenoverall rating 99/100The joker is about mentally unstable Arthur Fleck ( Joaquin phoenix) on trying to reach his dream of becoming a stand up comedian. But when things in his life dont go his way and his mental health deteriorates the joker clown is unleashed.Wow this movie was a masterpiece in every component i never thought my favourite movie of the year would be a DC movie but this film really shocked me at its artistry and brilliance lets talk about why this is.First of all the film had an absolutely incredible score. Wow the soundtrack really left an impact in the most important scenes in the film. When there was something uncomfortable or important happening on the screen the score got louder and louder. And i especially enjoyed the score when Joaquian phoenix became the complete joker. It made you excited for what he was going to do and added important to the final act.Next the film was actually pretty funny. Some of the comedy jokes within the film mostly landed. And Robert de niro added excellent comedic moments to the movie as well as his fantastic acting. His sarcastic comments definitely drew some laughs from me despite him suffering the repercussions of making these jokes about Arthurs character i just thought he added a nice dynamic to the movie.Next i thought the movie had excellent character development for the lead role and the female character (Zaze Beetz) was a great addition to the movie as well. I thought Zazes character did a really good job with what little screen time she had. She kind of was the main reason for Arthur not going completely insane for half of the movie and if she wasn't a character he would of went mad much more quickly. Next Arthurs character development was fantastic. To see his slow decent into madness throughout the film really left an impact with me. So many things in his life was going wrong that from my perspective i understood why he snapped. From losing his job to realising dark secrets about his mum it was really interesting to see how his mental health slowly got worse and worse.Next the plot twist and final act were fantastic and definitely the best parts of the movie aside from Joaquin phoenix being fantastic. I thought the plot twist of Sophie never actually being beside Arthur was a really interesting twist. As she was keeping him relatively sane throughout the movie but with this twist it just proves he was mad all along so that was great. And the final act was just fantastic when Arthur transformed completely into the joker it was just fantastic. He had a fantastic script he looked fantastic and terryfying and the events left me satisfied with the ending. The gore also added a lot of impact to a lot of the scenes and added a fatality realistic portrayal of violence in modern society.Next the film had an excellent balance between sympathy and fear of Arthurs character. With all the events that was happening to him at the beginning and the fact that he couldn't control his laughing to it being a condition you couldn't help but feel sorry for him. But this sympathy soon turned to fear of what he is capable off when he is off his medication and the film did a brilliant job of balancing these two out therefore being tonally consistent. Adding onto that the film executed an incredible tense and uncomfortable tone throughout. Wow this film had you on edge throughout. Whether it was the haunting laugh of Arthur. Or his disformed body. The film really put you in a place of discomfort which i loved as that was i believe the directors desired passive reaction for the audience.Next the cinematography and visuals were stunning. There was some really stunning shots in this film largely close ups of the joker that really were fantastic to look at. The films colour palette was fantastic as well it was just a very well shot and directed movie.Now next is not a negative more like a realisation. Now i understand why this film is causing some controversy in some aspects but a lot of people are taking it to far. I can see how it can be taken the wrong way in terms of supporting violence and anybody who watches the film in a similar situation to Arthur may take the film very literally but in my opinion this was not the films main goal. As i believe it a more harsh and realistic portrayal of how dangerous modern society is and this themes was portrayed excellently. And really made me think and question about how mad and dangerous society and the whole world is in this day and age.Now for my final two positives. Firstly i loved that they involved young batman in this story. His interactions with the joker was fantastic and it saddened me that they wont meet again on screen. And seeing his parents deaths again was sad to see but also bought back nostalgia from previous batman movies.And finally the best part of this film was of course Joaquin Phoenix. Wow he was truly incredible here. He really put every escene of his being into making his interpretation of the joker his own. And boy did he do a good job. He found a way to differentiate himself from all the other portrayals and matches the legendary performance of Heath Ledger. He was commited to the role and clearly lost a lot of weight. And his acting was the reason the film had such a uncomfortable tone as it was so believable. You could see the madness in his eyes and that intensity and madness got more and more recognisable as the movie went on he definitely deserves at least an oscar nomination but really a win for this.Overall the joker is a true cinematic masterpiece that is pretty much perfect. Filled with excellent performances/themes and visuals and it really proves that the standard of DC movies is improving rapidly."
770,"One of the best movies I've seen my entire time , already watched twice and going for a third time next week"
771,This movie is only boring to those that are used to action. This movie for those who really know the Joker. That this movie was a beautiful narrative told from his perspective. Highly recommend to keep that in mind if you don't know if you should watch it.
772,"Yeah, they did turn the archetype of arch enemy into the anti hero but I was expecting that in a solo movie.
I'm sure everyone has had that moment when the world pushes them too far and you wanted to push back as hard as you felt they pushed you, but instead of doing that you go and watch the movie Joker. especially with others who understand how your feel.
Joaquin Phoenix was brilliant in this film. Too bad with all the controversy he won't win an Oscar form it. It's the perfect academy award winning movie too, Phoenix as the Joker out shines he movie but unlike other Oscar contenders this year like Judy, The movie shines pretty brightly on it's own.
Loved the connection between the Joker and his greatest enemy that could have went badly but it worked out well.
It's a slow movie but I found Phoenix humorous. Not a violent as I though more like a lot intent for violence then small quick burst of it. I understand how this movie could be looked at as a bad stigma for the mentally ill, but for me, the flick easily told a tale of frustration and anger for anyone who knows what it truly feels like to be pushed around. It's good that he does not randomly target anyone, Anyone that get hurt by the joker is someone who (he felt) hurt him. It's the perfect origin of a supervillain. Overall it's worth it to see that transformation."
773,Complete garbage. Nothing but an artsy Oscar grab and boring. Takes the whole mystique of the joker and turns him into a whiny wimp with mommy issues. I wish i could give it negative stars. I would rather eat my weight in refried beans and ride a roller coaster than watch this waste of film again.
774,"This movie had a lot of potential. A very suitable actor (Phoenix) for the role as looker seemed perfect, and his acting was fine! But the movie is too damn slow! The directing for this movie was just bad. Also the cliche moment of this movie were to obvious..."
775,"This is a good movie. Dark, tragic and brooding. So many excellent aspects to it. Great acting, sets, costumes. Fantastic score.But...The context is that this is The Joker of Batman Nemeses notoriety. The film just doesn't fit. Arthur is a truly sad and tragic, disturbed and intellectually challenged character. His back story is deeply disturbing and one cannot help but feel sympathy if not empathy. The REAL Joker is not a sad victim. He is a malevolent, intelligent maniac. Not someone you have an ounce of sympathy for.I think this movie fails because of this context. If it was purely a study into the psychological development of a sociopath I think it would be excellent. Sadly it is not. It is the origin story of a comic book baddie. Nothing comic book baddie about this miserable human.There are a few other issues I had with it, there primary one being that he is incapable of coherent speech and social interaction throughout the movie but he suddenly is able to produce a powerful monologue on set in front of a live audience and in front of TV cameras and his former idol. I understand that his confidence grows the less he has to lose but I found this jarring and dissonant.I also found his fantasy relationship silly and then overly ""explained"".That aside, Joachim is phenomenal!! A one man tour de force. Truly believable if not relatable.This is a must see for his performance but I think Batman fans will be disappointed."
776,"This movie is a boring movie who didn't do anything to us, not emotional without anything important and joker in this movie is acting very stupid gay who dances like a creep. Endgame is better in every subject about ratings, awards and box office, the only problem is the way to let people to mark movies by their own stupid reasons and it's just three points better than endgame and it's getting lower."
777,Only saving grace is the genius of the lead actor.
778,"Let me start with my summary.. ""Mehhh"".Why on earth this movie had to be in the DC universe I have no idea. A criminal mastermind Joaquin Phoenix's joker will never be. As a social commentary on mental illness it might have worked. But this guy is not the joker, nor is there anyway he could become the joker. He is just too sad of a character.The tacked on violence at the end seemed like something put there as a crowd pleaser for all the people that was expecting something related to Batman. Ohh naturally they had to put in the killing of Batmans parents. I mean that way we know it has something to do with the joker right?We were three guys in our mid thirties and we were all thoroughly bored. Well acted but not interesting."
779,"Sorry but I did not like this movie.
I like drama but this was boring for me and too dark. Especially since this is fictitious town from a comic book and also a fictitious comic book character. It did not feel like a story about a real life person but just all made up for entertainment sake.
And the Joker not getting fired straight away for all his misconducts and inability to really make jokes was not believable. Especially after he took that gun to the hospital, in the real world who would have gotten fired instantly and reported to the police for illegal possession.
The talk show host was not really convincing either (I like Robert de Niro but this was not his best...) in regards to inviting him to the show. He actually thought he was a bad comedian so why invite him? To make fun out of him?
If I wanted to see a movie about a psychopath I would have wanted it to look more realistic and not have comic book character and half real life.
I have the feeling that some people watch the Marvel stories so much that they think the characters are real."
780,"I really have no idea why this film gets this kind of hype and rating. Coming in I was excited to see what was all the hype about but I left in despair and asking myself what's wrong with me for not liking this movie? Has it become a norm that everything that feels a little different automatically means we have an oscar on our hands? JP definitely deserves all the praise he's getting but I can't shake the feeling that it was all tried too hard to make it look way too serious and different while the plot didn't at all get the same treatment. I'm sorry, but this film doesn't live up to its expectations, it really doesn't."
781,"You will notice the far left journalists: the New York Times, Rolling Stone, The Guardian and the rest all despised ""Joker."" They made up different prevarications such as no fun, meaningless, nihilistic, dangerously provocative and on and on. The real reason they had to gang up on this film and Phillipps is that we are seeing this fantasy become reality in America.The far left run cities: Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Baltimore, Detroit, Chicago and others look like Gotham. They are literally overflowing with filth, drug addicts, mental patients roaming free and bureaucrats running and enjoying it all. The are supported by hypocritical filmmakers with loads of money, politicians, and business leaders.Phillipps is famous for non-PC, in-your-face comedy: rude, crude and breakout funny. But he cannot make films like that anymore. No one can. The far left speech police are violent, hate-filled, arrogant and stupendously self-righteous. Joker is the far left dystopia that is our future, coming soon to a neighborhood near you. They want the border eliminated, jails opened, locks broken and the rights of middle class citizens taken to allow mass bedlam.They want the hard working, value driven bedrocks of society mutilated, defeated and destroyed in the ensuing melee. That has been their dream as under-realized by Marx, Lenin, Stalin, Hitler and modern socialists.This is a great film. It is a monumental film. It is not a comedy, it is a horror film. It is the kind of horror film few people pay to see: psychological horror and terror. Then why has it already made more than a billion dollars? Because there are so many people cheering for this very outcome. Others see it for it's greatest value: a look at the future."
782,"Let me start off by saying the cinematography is as good as people say. The acting is also truly impressive and for those that are not into comic book movies this should be a great depiction. But that's also where I find myself wondering how people are even putting Joker into the same ballpark as The Dark Knight. The issue I have is the same issue I had with Suicide Squad. The Joker isn't just an insane man causing chaos as far as he walks. He is calculated and intelligent. Striking the perfect balance between insane and I wonder is it all an act. In this movie I only witnessed an mental disturbed man with pain in is life go off the rails. I never felt he had the capacity to formulate a world ending plot, bit rather just finds himself fortunate to have everything fall in place. Still a great movie,it's just not The Joker."
783,"What a movie!! From start to finish it is an absolute masterpiece, the way Phoenix portrays the Joker is a Oscar worthy performance. The movies overall message about mental health and how people get affected is amazing, it shows that doesn't matter what goes on people always have problems and always need help!! Will hands down be one of, if not the best movie of 2019!"
784,"Joker is the best movie to release this year. I doubt any movie releasing this year will come close to it. Joker tackles mental illnesses perfectly. Despite the brutalities he's caused throughout the movie, you can't just help yourself but to feel sorry for him. I'd be a liar if I said I didn't cry at least twice during the movie. Fleck really shows how one bad day can drive you over the edge. It perfectly depicts how mental illnesses can drive you to do inhumane stuff. The violence in Joker felt way too real, all the deaths in the film, the 3 Wall Street guys, Arthur's mom, Randall, Murray Franklin. I felt like I was there for the deaths. The death that hit me the most was Murray, it was so sudden and out of the blue. Arthur really looked up to Murray as a father figure, an icon. When Arthur admitted to killing the Wall Street guys, that's when he really turned into Joker. Arthur Fleck was long gone.Joker really isn't a movie. It's a wake up call. It's a fictionalized documentary. It goes to show how one bad day can destroy your entire life. If you're suffering from mental illnesses, please don't hesitate to ask for help."
785,"What a fantastic evening out - with son and daughter (both older than the lead!) and loads of popcorn to see Joaquin Phoenix give the performance of his life in Joker.
No spoilers and a huge amount to contemplate and revisit in further viewings. Suffice to say this is a slow burn movie with brilliant director, leading cast and cinematography and run down Gotham City staging that makes this a mesmerising movie experience. Everyone will be talking about their favourite moments - mine includes a certain door key!
Joaquin as the evil Emperor Commodus gave us the famous 'thumbs down' to Russell Crowe as Maximus in Gladiator but it is a resounding 'thumbs up' for his remarkable portrayal of mentally ill Arthur Fleck in his descent to madness to become the criminal mastermind known as the Joker.
."
786,"I'm going to keep this short and sweet because there isn't much that hasn't already been said and explored but if you're reading this wanting a little input or motivation to see this movie, then all I can say is ""If you don't get it, you won't like it, if you do get it, you won't stop thinking about it.""Best movie in a long time."
787,Great. Awesome performance . Directing perfect acting from all actors perfect but the movie over all is not that much of thriller or idont know may be i wanted more but it really needed more.
788,"This movie will make you sad, make you angry and maybe it'll make you a little bit crazy too."
789,I was numb on the first half of the movie. Shouldn't have watched it because now I can't get over it. I will lose faith in humanity if Joaquin Phoenix is not winning Oscar for this.
790,What i saw was the best movie I've ever seen since long time
791,"I am just amazed at how this only 69% of critics liked it, but it has a 9.0 here! I admit that it's not as good as Heath Ledger's Joker, but it's still awesome. The funny thing is that there's a good reason why the movie isn't called ""THE Joker"". The creators said that the Joker might just be a persona various people took. Batman does in fact appear in this, but only as a small child. He's worked very well into the plot.I could really associate with what Joker was going through. He had been taking all these medicines yet none of them worked. He was angry at the rich for oppressing the poor. Him killing rich people at first really does inspire people. It really was a great study on the status of the richest and treats the story as very mundane. That was kind of already done in ""The Dark Knight"", but the focus is done so well here too. ***1/2"
792,"I haven't seen such a masterpiece for a long time. It's unbelievable. I don't know if it was right to still call this acting, as it seems to have been brought from another dimension. Your are part of this movie. You are part of the thoughts of The Joker. You even become like him.. My laughter has changed forever now!
A must-watch!"
793,"Amazing acting, superb directing. Keeps you fascinated include to to the screen. Dark, Twisted, and Fun."
794,"This is what we were waiting for, the best joker ever, the acting of phoenix was unbelievable, the directing was perfect this what we need from long time."
795,"I don't usually review movies but this one was something different something fresh and even after watching 5 days back, the movie isn't getting out of my head.Great acting by Joaquin, story telling style was so unique, the background score and a cinematography. Totally Flawless & Loved it."
796,"Awesome movie ever watched bgm, visuals, performances just woow... Joaquin phoenix lived on the screen the story hatts off to tod phillips,I think an oscar is waiting for the work"
797,"This movie lived up to the hype. I can say that they shot this movie beautifully and Joaquin Phoenix had an outstanding performance, and eveyone should see it its a MUST! This movie captures alot especially In this day n age where these problems like mental health actually happen alot.."
798,Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix and incredible detailed so much power in todd mind brilliant direction amazingly written and outstanding score lovely combination thats what we called a True Masterpiece. All Hail to the JOKER.. i want this watch again ng again....
799,What can I say? I'm a massive Batman fan and a little obsessed with the franchise. I wanted to watch this movie to get a background on the Joker to complete my Batman experience. I've watched every Batman ever made including the Adam West TV show as a kid.I came out of this movie in absolute awe and to be honest a little emotional. It was a beautiful portrayal of a beautifully mad man. I feel emotional after watching it. It spoke to me on so many levels. What would happen if we just let go and have in to the voices in our heads and ignored societies restraints? This was what happens.Hands down the best movie I've ever seen in my life. Without a doubt. Heath Ledger looks like Bonzo the clown compared to this. As for Old mate from suicide squad he needs to never do another one.
800,"Ignore these haters, trust me. They're extremely biased and are simply hating this movie because people like it and because they expect it to be something that it isn't.Things you MUST know before you watch the movie is that this isn't a ""Batman"" movie. It's not an action movie. If you're expecting a ton of action and explosions and a lot happening then this isn't the right movie for you.This movie is a drama. It's a drama about a man named Arthur and how he became ""Joker."" It doesn't really go into details or explore his childhood. The movie is about a very small portion of Arthur's life that happened just right up to before he becomes ""Joker."" The premise is pretty simple and not overly complicated.The reason this movie is loved is because it's beautifully shot and executed. The acting is superb, the cinematography is beautiful, the score is chilling, the art and flow is very poetic. This is not a movie you watch with your eyes. This is a movie that you must watch with your mind. It goes deep into the human psyche. It presents simple things in a different light. It dances, literally AND figuratively between light and dark, good and bad, right and wrong. You have to pay attention or you'll miss the message.I enjoyed the movie and I believe it's a type of movie that requires multiple viewings to get the full experience. There's a lot of subtle details that are easily missed even if you pay attention."
801,"This movie deserves all the possible oscars, specially best actor."
802,"This was one of my best moviegoer experiences!
Joaquin Phoenix is simply brilliant in this role and the movie is much deeper, darker and grounded in reality than any feature film in the Batman universe.
I was honestly so impressed that I had to fight the urge to start applauding when it was over! I haven't felt that way about a film in years!"
803,"Joker was a complete masterpiece for anyone who loves a good dark piece of this world. The starting, the rollercoaster rides of emotions and the clever use of music were all points of minute observation. The trial of making it into the exact 70s climate was great with the super rats and garbage lying around. The movie surely is an eye opener in a way for those who want to understand the side effects of being under constant pressure and turmoil. The audience surely loved the impact it had on stigma against going to a psychologist. This movie surely is worth every penny."
804,"I've never written a review or rated a movie before. BUT this! I had to. This needs to get as much positive recognition. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS MOVIE. With all it's darkness, Reality of society. This is REAL. A movie to make people uncomfortable to make people see and understand. A movie where they can't turn away. I hope this brings awareness. How to be kind to one another. But over all this movie was genius. Epic. BEAUTIFUL."
805,"JokerFilm is not your normal comic hero/villian movie, it's more a commentary on society's treatment of vulnerable people and it's volitile consequences. Brittiant film and well worth seeing👍🃏Note: All it takes is an act of kindness to prevent a monster. Let it be a clown or a bat!

806,"This Joker is darker than Dark Knight's Joker, The most miserable Joker than any other Joker, And most chaos Godam City ever. But it is most beautiful than any other Joker. Lastly, I can say, ""This Movie is Perfect"""
807,"This is not a movie to be enjoyed or entertained but taken as strong message to bring the humanity. I was expecting it to be great movie but it turned out to be 'one of the greatest' movie. This movie deserves multiple watch. This movie is all about how a man who is disregarded by the society, bitter treatment from society, abandoned by society, and failure as a comedian made him a serial killer. Never ever we should step into crime world because of the dark society. We always should seek some help from a trustworthy guy instead of stepping into crime world. But a major point which can't be neglected is 'dark society'. In a place where this Joker tries to spread joy and happiness has got him only kicks and punches not just on his body but on his inner self, too. This wounded him deeply. This filled his life with loads of pain, depression, mental disorder and what not resulting in a 'serial killer' and 'chaos' all around. Society can't be blamed always. Both society and the victim should be blamed. Both society and victim should vomit all the darkness.Ending with my single line thought:
What society need is good heart to understand and love each other. What victim need is love and warmth hug from the society.joaquin phoenix, lead actor of this movie, wore the role as his own skin."
808,"The character of Joker received much more love even though being an antagonist in The Dark Knight Trilogy. Todd Philips did a phenomenal job of creating an origin story for Joker and had the guts to present a standalone movie to the public. This movie leaves you in a shock for a moment and makes you think a lot. Some shocking moments that totally grips you, I find no reason as to keep this movie reserved for only 18+
Camera movement and the shots taken are so cool that they deliver a story without a single dialogue being said. This movie keeps you glued to the screen till the end credits roll in.It is a must watch for all Joker Fans and I believe the count of these fans will increase all the more!"
809,"Phoenix showed me what it is to be a joker. i watched the whole movie with heath in mind.one scene actually showed me heath . the transformation is brilliant. mother sentiment is beautiful.
Gripped me from the beginning.Arthur fleck /Joker is definitely will be in mind for a long time.
much awesome direction from todd phillips. Stunner"
810,"The only reason I hung in to the end of this movie is that I was sure there had to be some point to all of this...and there was but more to make a lasting impression of a political statement than to be entertaining.If you find Frankenstein, Dracula and Friday the 13th films entertaining, you'll love this...otherwise, it's a good make-out movie.... One you won't miss having seen."
811,I....I just can't believe..This movie is beyond good. It's same quality as Christopher Nolan movies. I love the every second of them. Every person needs to watch this movie.
812,Joker (2019) = overatedJust another cash grab *sigh*
813,Something is really wrong with society if that movie is so highly ranked.
814,"I just got out of watching JokerI have to say, it is really good... Possibly even great!! As a stand alone origin story, it's damn good. It moves at the pace of a 70's movie, so it may not be for everyone, but I found it mesmerizing to a level that it makes it an absolute winner. I think if they chopped about 15 minutes off the run time, it would have been better, whilst not missing a beat. There are elements of The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver as well as American Psycho.Now... Joaquin Phoenix might as well clear a space on his mantelpiece for an Oscar. I would be shocked if there is a better performance this year. The man is in every single scene. He carries this and at times, you forget that he is acting. His laugh is so real and twisted... The way he lost weight and transformed his body... The pain his character suffers and all the discoveries he makes that shape his life are just amazing and gracefully danced into a spectacular performance.There were a few predictable moments, but nothing to spoil the enjoyment!!Overall, this is a film to see, just to see one of the greatest actors of our time at the very top of his game.My screening was packed!! Only a spare seat here and there (annoyingly an ex and her new fella were in attendance🙈) second only to Avengers: End Game was was a complete sell out."
815,"Has nothing to do with the actual Joker. An old timer having the worse of his life goes crazy. That's it. Joker was no pu..y, this one is. Don't know what's with the hype. To understand me better, they used one of Amy Schumer's joke in the movie. It's that bad. I gave it 1 for the balance, too many paid 10's, it's a boring 3/4."
816,"The Best thing in this movie just the music
And the Scenario is not good"
817,"How is this better than Hitchcocks psycho and others like gladiator,life is beautiful,leon the pro,saving private ryan,alien etc....are you peoole mad or ❓what...."
818,Has nothing to do with the Batman movies and its just crank
819,"This movie is utterly unimaginative, full of cliches, boring and predictable. Plenty of ridiculous plot twists and chaotic, inconsistent and incomplete ideas. It also trivializes and destroys the Joker character built by previous films where he has a clear ideology and actually stands for something. Waste of time."
820,Acting is good.. quality of the movie is good.. but watching someone mentally unstable for 2hrs nty..
821,"Alright so if you were to ask me about the acting, the performance, the cinematography etc, Joker was good in that. However, the story line was completely messed up and disturbing. The film itself and what they teach you throughout is just wrong, I mean plain wrong! It basically encourages you to ""be the bad guy"" because ""bad stuff happened to u"".
Summary: Extremely Disturbing and Immoral"
822,"Joaquin Phoenix's performance is different. He is over acting some times. Phoenix is not being true to the character. He is what he is because what he experienced. The childhood trauma and the time he spend in the asylum. If He is out in the society because he is fit to do so. The seven medication doesn't seem to have a bit of effect on him.After the metro incident he is breaking a chain to free himself from what the society need him to be. There is no change in his ways. The character didn't evolve. He is same at the beginning and at the end.Seventy percent of the film's screen time is dedicated to Arthur Fleck. All the other characters are ill written, only to support him. They all lack a soul. Even Robert deniero disappoints us. He lost his aura somewhere in the nineties.
The film is spoon feeding us. The viewers are not idiots we know what realism is. The scene where he realizes the character Sophie is his figment of imagination is an utter failure. Apology to Andrei tarskovski. And the scene he is showing fatherly affection towards Murray is like a worst of the worst psycho moment.
After the incident of metro killings, the plot loses its grip. I clearly couldn't define what happening and why. The script hides in the smoke of violence. That is too disturbing to watch. And I forget to mention the letter. A Pathetic turn of the film. The film 'saw' is better than this.
I hate the communist tone used in the film. By showing us a glimpse of modern times, Todd Phillips making a point. The joker is saying he is not political. It is kind of a doublespeak. In fact the film is a doublespeak. Creating chaos without the intention of creating one. The poor class killing the rich for the societies inequality.What I loved in the Christopher Nolan's joker is his philosophy. He is an agent of chaos. He like to watch the world burn. While the Batman is an agent of order. He may be a clown but he is deep inside. The Nolan's joker can make an elaborate plan and execute it efficiently. But Philp's joker is mere a delusional shallow clown. I ask myself, Why the movie is called 'Joker'. Remove the names of Wayne family and give them another names. Replace Gotham by Manhattan. The result will not be a DC joker instead it will give us a psycho clown movie. Todd Philips used an icon for his own gain.A predictable ending. Giving the society a false message.for what? The film is not worth it. Yes, it is a masterpiece. Whisper it a trillion times, may be it will became one."
823,"Extremely overrated and overhyped, waited for a very long time this movie and walked out the theatre with 2 hours of ""Meh"". For the people saying this a ""CULT MOVIE"", ""film of the DECADE"", ""MASTERPIECE""... Dude, what to say? Give yourselves a break with MCU movies and Call of Duty and watch some more movies, read a couple of books and get out to see some real world out there. I'm not playing here Mr. Wise Guy but, when you read that kind of reviews it is really clear that people (including me) are terribly bombed by blockbusters and products that are made only thinking about breaking selling records and twitter trend topics. It is sad to see that the film industry has become that. To finish, do yourself a favor and go now to watch ""The King of Comedy"" (1982), it doesn't have CGI or superheroes, but you're gonna love it anyways, and maybe see a couple of similarities with ""Joker"" ..."
824,"This was a waste of time for me at least. I felt like I had seen it all before, on TV, you know one of those soap operas. Not sure how it's been ranked so high, I guess some just like snail paced movies where it's all about the sad upbringing of the main character.
Beware, this is not a DC movie, more like a telenovela."
825,"Bored during movie, very slow
Dark knight was far better than this
Acting is very good
Direction is very poor"
826,Heath Ledger occupies the screen for a fraction of the time that Joaquin Phoenix does but is by far the finest villain in at least Batman but I'd say one of the best performances ever. I just don't get why laughing hysterically and randomly at anything requires an Oscar. Batman is and loved by people without having to tell the story of the joker.
827,"This film's reactions are awful. All the ""reasonings"" and pivotal moments are so unbelievable or even worse predictable.Only one scene has any proper build up, everything else is as simple as bullying is bad. It's performances were average, nothing stood out as believable since the premised were so flimsy and poorly designed at the script level. All Juaqin did was be himself with a laugh. The cinematography was okay, it achieved an unsettling atmosphere early on. The soundtrack was misplaced and grated against all the moments in the film. The editing and pacing was adequate and in an hour and a half it's not a massive waste of time. Whatever awards for this film gets are undeserved and can be used as evidence that the award industry unnecessary as a whole."
828,"The reason I gave JOKER a 10 out of 10 is that 11 wasn't an option.
Phoenix's performance is outstanding. He brought an iconic character on screen in the most perfect style and he made me feel like I could finally see the real Joker from the comic books translated in the flesh. The subtleties and the nuances of his gestures are moving. I could not believe what my eyes were seeing. No offence to the other past attempts, but they do not go anywhere near this.
Everything in this masterpiece is absolute perfection from the beginning to the end. It's believable. It's technically spotless. It fits our times and the commentary on society is spot on."
829,"Beautifully filmed and acted, but not the movie you want to watch twice. Joaquin Phoenix was superb. Like buying a house is location, location, location. Movies are story, story, story. Story was strung along and the Wayne aspect was week. With all the tools that were available, it should have been a better film. It had great potential. Joaquin Phoenix carried the film too much."
830,"Joaquin did a great job pulling off the crazy weirdo vibe to a T. He is the psychopath that the joker is that isn't shown in the other movies. That said, the rest of the movie is a mess. It is not a masterpiece like a lot of reviews say for some reason. The random dancing and the constant laughing is over the top. The editing and pacing is all over the place. It's an interesting watch for sure, but it isn't a classic or masterpiece"
831,"I had read the reviews and watched the movie with great expectations. It was a pretty good movie but not great in my opinion. The pace was a little slow. Not nearly as intense or moving as it could have been. I also don't care for the message, trying to explain evil behavior with mental illness or an abusive childhood. Sometimes evil is just evil, plain and simple. Decent movie 7 stars."
832,"As films go it is ok, it is not a super villain movie so do not go expecting so. It's basically a film about mental health and one man's downward spiral into a very dark place. I feel we are suffering from a case of the Emperors new clothes unfortunately."
833,"After the legendary Batman trilogy of Christopher Nolan, we were saying that the successful Batman film does not come. And he didn't come. But the Joker ....... is a complete masterpiece. It is impressive that the drama he treats sociologically reveals the conflict between the rich and the poor."
834,Ive seen more than 3000 movies and Joker is by far my all time favorite. 10/10 nuff ssid.
835,"I did not pay any attention to the hype about Joker---I normally do not. When a friend of mine recommended me to watch it, I was still skeptical. Eventually I watched it and I was very wrong. It was far better than anything that I could have imagined from a blockbuster, especially considering its focus on such an over-filmed theme (the Joker). Relative to my level of expectations before watching it, Joker was very good, but if I adopt a more universal criteria of assessing a film, I should say that it was ""good but not perfect"".Four key elements are (commonly) considered as the main pillars of films: screenplay (script), cinematography, editing, and directorship (acting and music score are less critical parts, though they can sometimes play an equally important role for an enduring film). The only sub-perfect key element of Joker is its screenplay which---even if we forgive its several holes and minor flaws---has some fundamental flaws. For example, some key elements of the story-line are unreasonable and ""forced"" and words are put in the mouth of the characters to tell the audience things that were not part of the organic development of the story. These issues can partly be accepted due to the ambiguity of the story about the delusional character of the hero. But not all of them can be justified by the explanation ""it was another delusion."" Indeed, blurring of the border between delusion and reality which is a common theme in psychological movies were developed crudely.Despite these issues, the script was still OK and was not so bad to bring down the whole film.But---as many has already noted and it was very obvious from the very first minutes---what will give this movie a chance to become a true gem of cinema is the acting of Joaquin Phoenix as Joker. Perhaps acting is not the right word, because his performance looks like a literal embodiment of a difficult and complex role. For example, those laugh-cries of him were mesmerizing, chilling, authentic, penetrating, and unforgettable.Through the course of the story, he gradually loses contact with all that could have provided him some reasons to cling to hope, goodness, decency, and anything positive about society and the future. He loses everything and through this painful process sets himself ""free"" from all social bonds, including the need to be happy, or to maintain hope. Instead of climbing the stairs, he suddenly finds himself dancing ""downhill."" His freedom is unfortunately a direct stride toward the evil. The more colorful costumes he wears and the more ""smile"" he draws on his face, the darker he actually becomes. His twisted version of enlightenment is the existential realization that there is no hope or salvation in this dark world. He brilliantly metamorphosizes into an archetypal Joker."
836,"""It is sane to be insane in a society which is insane."" I am not a filmtheater person. I usually watch movies at my home. Now few of my friends recommended this film to me and I went to a theater. I had high hopes about Joker and I must say this is a masterpiece. I have diagnosis schizophrenia and I relate very much with Arthur Fleck. I feel sympathy for him when he says to the therapist ""You don't listen, do you?"" To be noticed, to be heard, to be seen is mentally big need for a person in relationships and in everyday life in general. This is a powerful movie, but I don't understand people who have left a theater because they thought it was too disturbing. I see it as a art cinema. Dark comedy is a wrong term, but I admit I laughed when Arthur dropped his gun at a children's hospital. It was last week when I saw Joker and it still is in my mind. Joaquin Phoenix will might get an Oscar for his performance."
837,"Wow wow wow Joaquin Phoenix is just mesmerizing
It is been a while since Hollywood came up with such an incredible movie
Kudos to everyone on this movie
Love it"
838,One of the best movies I've ever watched. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is absolutely stunning (and I thought Heather Ledger could not be beaten!). A must watch.
839,"The Joker (Arthur Fleck) endures hardship and ridicule in the most destructive manner possible whilst carrying various conditions that mount on top of his already broken mental state. Uncovering truths about his past and uncovering the real person behind the characters he admired.Although his way of punishing those that hurt him was at the very least psychotic, his beliefs were clear. Nothing in the system was stopping the city's everyday dilemmas it faced and Arthur knew he had to somehow get the message out despite the monumental issues he had personally. Arthur tried to be someone that would bring happiness in-spite of his own poverty-ridden life. Unfortunately, his conditions made the stage that he thought would benefit him, transform into a 'joke' aimed towards him which has catastrophic consequences in his life, and the 'normal people' in Gotham city.From the perspective of the Joker (Arthur), we can see why he acts the way he does. He acts that way because it seems he cannot escape the world he lives in. Gotham cages Arthur into a maniacal state of mind and forces Arthur to expose what he finds that is wrong with 'the people' around him.Arthur embraces his conditions, abnormal and psychotic mindset despite what effect it has had on his life. As the 'clown people' get behind him, Arthur becomes accepted. He is no longer alone. He carries what is 'right' for the people and refuses to recant his beliefs to tell his story.He thinks that the way people think is corrupt and that he is the result of that and unfortunately the victim of a 'bad joke'.Opinion: The film takes the unconventional method of exploring dark themes and in some cases, grips the audience in a roller-coaster ride of the devastation of mental illness' and hardships in poverty-stricken people's lives.By exploring those themes, we are given a rough picture of what it is like when you've really hit the low point. The film doesn't hold back in going into deep meaningful plot developments about the expectations of how 'we should behave' and how the Joker is the perfect example of someone in desperate need of help and affection.The Joker is a film that is a must watch to end the decade of the 2010s.A chilling way to introduce the Joker and I think Heath Ledger would be proud."
840,"Masterpiece movie of the decade to influence generations.
Joker is a Traumatizing psychological drama/thriller that puts the spotlight on a comic book villian called joker.
Though the movie is inspired by the comic world which is imaginary, the movie feels real and authentic.
Unlike other comic book movies which are filled with CGI and animation, joker uses story over action.
The movie is about arthur fleck (joaquin phoenix), a middle aged, miserable, poor standup comedian who suffers from mental problems and lives with his old mother.
He lives in gotham city where the people are cruel, emotionless and awful. Arthur is lonely and helpless yet he tries to be a good human being by sending positive energy and trying to make the people laugh and smile but the others are so wicked, merciless, enraged and furious they don't even accept him and make him feel worse by bullying, beating and abandoning him. Imagine what happens when a victim of society runs out of patience and turns extremely evil.
The atposphere of the film is quite dark and the pace of the movie is a little slow in the beginning but as we go forward in the story it goes faster and faster just like a roller coaster.
The music and soundtracks used in the movie are perfectly in place and completely related to the theme of movie.
The climacteric of the movie is joaquin phoenix's fabulous and oscar worthy acting , where he delivers the sense of the film in the best way possible.
Joker might be one of the darkest movies made in decades but definitely deserves to be watched with patience and attention because it's one of the few movies that besides giving audience entertainment it tries to make people think."
841,"If you are someone, who is a bit more sensitive and is scared of violent movies, this movie will touch you.If you are someone, who expects a lot of action and does not bother with violence, this movie can be disappointing.To me it feels that this movie was more about getting a message about nowadays society sent to everyone and also about getting a performance of a lifetime for Joaquin Phoenix than actually about the story itself or Joker.I enjoyed it but expected more. When the movie ended, this is where I actually wanted for the movie to begin as it seemed like the actual beginning of Joker!"
842,"Impressive technical aspects, performance, score in service of a predictable, pretentious, although good scriptI'll watch it again so as to better understand it though..which is a thing that i honestly won't say about any of the previous mcu or dceu movie(ITS DEFINITELY DELICIOUSLY COMPLEX & DEEP IN PARTS)The movie is almost too much reliant upon Phoenix's performance as joker, if you look at it from a pure prospective of script/story, you'll definitely find it to be underwhelming(CHARACTER DRIVEN NARRATIVE, LEAD PERFORMANCE TAKES CENTRE STAGE OVER STORY)It talks about mental health in a way that i haven't previously seen in any movie,that being said it doesn't bring anything new to the table & do things that have been previously done better in movies like taxi driver & the king of comedy(SOMEWHAT LACKS ORIGINALITY, TOO MUCH INSPIRED FROM THESE MOVIES)As far as the character of joker is concerned..it's definitely not something you're familiar with and movie doesn't seem to care to show much about his character development as joker who would face off against Batman in the future.. I.e
An formidable opponent of Batman in terms of intellect & physical strength(NOT A COMIC ACCURATE JOKER,WHICH CAN BE A CRITICISM OR NOT,DEPENDS UPON YOUR PROSPECTIVE)It may seem like I'm being too harsh in this review, but i also believe that it's one of the most important movie of our times, & also hope that it'll gives studios like Disney & sony to grow balls & give us R rated movies of characters like Deadpool,logan & venom so as tho give their comic book counterparts proper justice"
843,"Firstly, Joaquin Phoenix as Joker is undisputedly going to win an Academy award for his performance. The way this film deals with the central character and the plot is brilliant. It may seem to glamorize mental illness or gun violence but this is a Joker origin story, Batman's nemesis and we see his story unfold with his very own eyes and the movie succeeds to do so.You can feel the pain he goes through trying to survive in this cruel and dark world and what laughing at wrong things can do to a person. We're not supposed to sympathize with such a person but you can't help feel sorry for what he's been through and what goes in his mind. There are really tense moments in the film along with moments of relief and solace.The people of Gotham were already fed up with the elite and rich. The way things turn out by the end of the movie reminds me of Heath Ledger's Joker line 'I'm an agent of chaos' and that's certainly what happened. He aggravated the people, introduced anarchy and total chaos. Being very authentic to the character of Joker.The score is just perfect, it tries to capture the loneliness when a mentally-ill person gets thrown away by society and the descent that follows later. The visuals, lighting and cinematography couldn't be more well suited for the theme of the movie. It feels kind of liberating what a person can achieve and disrupt the persistent nature of individuals, make them see true their colors no longer held accountable by society or the rules and go haywire. This movie as a Joker origin story is nothing less than flawless and phenomenal."
844,"What a movie?!
I loved every second of this movie. Not only it explains Joker it really restarts Batman.
Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar and the movie as well! Music too."
845,"Damn, just,,, damn! This is my first review, probably because this is the first movie since I signed up that motivated me to do so. It's also the third movie that I've given a perfect rating for. At my age (44), I exclusively watch comic book, Science Fiction, Science Fantasy and Fantasy. If I want Drama, all I need to do is analyze life, I want films to take me someplace unknown. With Joker I mistakenly thought that I would be getting a comic book movie, how wrong I was a pleasantly surprised too.I have no other way to describe Joker than to say it is a masterpiece. Everyone involved in its making gets top marks from me and my thanks."
846,"I was reading DC Comics since 10, I am 37 now and I can say that this version of the Joker is almost as good as Heath Ledgers one!The Joker character is such a complex and disturb one but is so difficult to dislike him, it has such a range of personalities and is so charismatic...I enjoyed so much Jack Nicholson as the Joker, I idolize the Ledgers one and honestly this one is almost as good..., Depends on the taste I should say, like a good wine or art... But even if you don't know nothing about this character or comics is a must see! The performances are outstanding, the plot is tremendous and the most important thing it shows so many faces of our society! A must!"
847,"Joker (2019) tells a story about an unbalanced comedian named Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) being disregarded by society. He goes upon a path of self-discovery, in which his mental condition gets worse as the movie progresses.On the same note, the movie's plot was inspired by both Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy. That being said, the movie still manages to find its unique tone without completely copying one of the movie's narrative.Joaquin Phoenix delivers a oscar-worthy performance. His performance was jaw-dropping - no joke! He went through an extraordinary transformation throughout the entire course of the movie. You really feel sympathy for this guy, and you want him to achieve his goal. That's how good Joaquin is.This movie is, without a doubt, a piece of art. Whether it's the cinematography, the soundtrack or the cast themselves, they all deliver on it flawlessly.That being said, this movie is absolutely not for the faint of heart. It contains graphic violence, language, and it can be sometimes pretty depressing. It touches upon various subjects that you don't usually see in a standard Hollywood movie nowadays. Such as: anxiety depression and society itself etc. To some, it can be a problem. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend it for those kinds of people.Verdict: despite its controversy it gained in the past few weeks, Joker proves that there's so much more you can do with a standard comic book movie rather than watching it and forgetting about it afterwards. On the contrary, it approaches the viewers, and it makes them ask questions and think about the movie's existence, and what it has to say. I want to see more movies being made like this. Honestly, I was kind of sick of superhero movies, up until I saw this one. It gave me hope. It shows that there's more you can do with this medium."
848,"A masterpiece in character acting, Joaquin is stunning."
849,Best film i watched it was very good and nice so I recommend you to go watch it as fast as you can😂🌚
850,I went along to this thinking it was a Marvel type offering. How wrong I was. Totally immersed in this film to the point of being overwhelmed by emotion.One of the best movie experiences I have ever had.
851,"MASTERPIECE!!! The acting, cinematography, script, and the original score is phenomenal!!! This movie is triumph."
852,"Todd Phillip's Joker is strange, gripping, and unlike the films it shares its comic book category. Grounded by a world that's hard to look at, littered with sure-to-be-iconic character shots, fueled by a heart breaking performances, and sewn together by a near perfect score; Joker is sure to both divide and captivate audiences for decades to come"
853,"I don't understand why this trash movie is being reviewed so well ! I saw this movie and this was a very depressing movie with an actor that was totally forcing the laugh of Joker and it was pathetic! Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger and Jared Leto did a much ....... better job with the role of Joker ! This 2019 Joker is just an extremely malnourished sorry excuse of Joker! I wish I never waisted my time watching this movie!!"
854,"Rating 4.5/10
I just buy ticket from PREMIUM HALL to see this movie because previously i saw a good reviews from IMDB. The previews of this movie make you want to see it, but it wasn't nearly as good as i expected it to be. The character of Joaquin Phoenix who is obviously suffering from mental illness is really bad and annoying !! I truly do not understand the high rating on this film. Very disappointing."
855,"I am writing this review in the interval while I am watching the movie. The first half is a sheer torture to watch. This movie is so, so boring. I'm cursing myself for deciding to watch this. Horrible!"
856,Slow with an incomprehensible plot .The only saving grace is Joaquin Phoenix. Sometimes the character is highly exaggerated and his mannerisms become annoying after a while.
857,"In the words of Ford Fairlane, ""It's like m@sturbating with a cheese grater, slightly amusing, but mostly painful.This is one of the worst movies ever. 10/10??? So many who claim this as a master piece? Are you so scared to be seen as an outsider that you also add your vote to this uniquely horrible trash film so other will at least think you are bright and not stupid? I'd rather be seen as stupid and know that I can at least see the difference between a master piece and this crap.Phoenix acting was mediocre at best. All the incessant laughing? Really?? Was that even necessary? This would have been a great movie if it had an intro and credits. All the BS in between could have been left out. There, done! minutes max.At least I did not pay to watch this as I would have been double dumb if that was the case."
858,"Who is the crazier one?
The one who is able to adapt without contradiction to the conditions of a cynical, violent and morally corrupt time, or the one reacting on those conditions with uncompromising insanity, fighting back, using his own weapons of revenge, reflecting world's madness with an insane grimace?
This is the disturbing question the film poses in the figure of The Joker, equally fascinating, frightening and pitifully embodied by Phoenix, an unforgettable performance with great depth and a wide range of emotions: a Travis Bickle for the 21st century, and Robert De Niro himself paying tribute to this 43 years later after his own legendary performance in Taxi Driver."
859,"I haven't been this obsessed with a movie since I saw Taxi Driver 30 years ago...and my obsession for Joker surpasses it in spades. Everyone else has said all there is to say, I can't really add to it other than to say it almost feels pointless to go to the movies after seeing this because it's impossible for anything to compare. I can't explain why it's so good, you just have to see it. The directing, cinematography, music, screenplay, and of course the jaw dropping acting....everything about it is flawless. The timing of the film is uncomfortable, yes, but I think it's needed. Joker doesn't teach us to be violent. It teaches us to STOP BEING SUCH ***HOLES TO EACH OTHER.I understand that not everyone will connect with this film or ""get it"". And you're not supposed to. This is a film for those who relate to it in some way and not everyone will. But if you do, if you get it, you won't ever see a more remarkable and all consuming film. It's truly astonishing filmmaking.And if it doesn't sweep every category at the Oscars because of controversy then shame on the Academy and shame on everyone voting."
860,"If you just smile your life would be happier ....
this movie takes my mind and all in in my head are happy cause you mustn't give a damn about others when they make fun of you and say bad things to make you sad . Because that's life us the song of Sinatra's says some people get their kicks stomping on a dreamI don't say go kill others like joker but don't ignore bad behavior from others just strike back and have a smile !That's life gentlemen"
861,"Dark, twisted and amazingly disturbing. Arthur is such a complex character. This movie isn't just abou t him as a character but an example of how a mentally ill person lives and wants to be normal. I have a mental illness as well and I relate to Arthur perfectly, people have let me down, I've felt like my life was worth nothing. And we mentally ill people we just want to be noticed and understood, and that's what Arthur really wanted in his life, I perfectly relate to him. This film also tells us how bullying can affect the victim and what a cruel world this is. Otherwise, the film felt heavy and tragic. I watched it 2 days ago and it's still bugging in my head. Could definitely watch it again."
862,"Maybe it's not connected to the comics or it's source material, but for the love of god, THIS movie is everything i ever wanted for a movie about the infamous clown prince of crime.Joaquin's performance is beautiful, scary, depressing, and violent. From Phoenix' laugh, you can actually feel his sorrow, to be honest i feel sad everytime he laughed.Also a plus point for the cinematography and scoring, both score and visuals made a prefect blend.This movie diffuses illusion, dreams, and reality into one, so it's kinda hard to tell which is which.So it's a 10/10 from me."
863,"This movie is phenomenal. Joaquin Phoenix didn't just play the Joker, he became the joker and the slow burn story was not boring if anything it was the perfect rendition of how the Joker came to be. So realistic that you feel bad for Arthur Fleck and you just wanna give him a hug."
864,"Acting 10/10
Actors 10/10
Sound 8/10
Soundtrack 9/10
Dolby Atmos 6/10
Drama 9/10
Action 3/10
Suspense 9/10
Story 10/10Conclusion:
When you ever want to know why exist joker and batman you must see this film.Jaquin phoenix play his role very intense he play the feelings of the character authentic i never think about that the character is not real i look outside and i can find one normal person who can have the problems from the playing character. Joker is more than a dc story joker is the mirror of the society."
865,"This truly is Phoenix's magnum opus. Few films are able to have such strongly resonating and impactful displays of violence that over the span of the film, through such an emotionally developed character, creates an uneasy feeling of genuine consequence to each driving action that Arthur performs in the creation of his alter ego.Phoenix's performance is so unnervingly raw the viewer is left perplexed by the deep insight into the constantly decaying mind of the man behind the makeup. A pleasantly surprising dedication to a role prior known only to fans of the character as a chaotic evil."
866,"The whole movie, starting from the very first scene, connects to you deeply. It is a rare movie, I'd say, these kind of movies are made once in a century. It has all kinds of emotions, lows and highs, ups and downs, everything. The way they connect the story between Arthur Fleck (early Joker) & kid Bruce Wayne (Batman in future) made so much sense and had so much meaning to it. The script, story, screenplay, direction, everything in the movie was on point. The Music Director - Hildur Guðnadóttir completely nailed the BGM.I don't think we can find any fault in the movie, because there was not even one single actor who acted a bit off. Everything in this movie, was simply, perfect.Hence, Simply Brilliant."
867,Joaquin Phoenix What an actor I watch it more and more
868,I can tell Joaquin Phoenix doesn't looked like he is acting in the movie but he already dominates the role of the Joker himself and that is why he is an Oscar-Worthy. And actually the storyline is a little bit slow but it's very perfect.Great job!!
869,"This is an absolute must watch, it's a dark movie about the injustices of society"
870,"This film lives up to the hype. It was superbly crafted and I can smell the Oscar nominations already. I will also say it was probably one of the most psychologically disturbing films I've ever seen and I'm not in any hurry to see it again any time soon.
But do yourself a favour, see it on the big screen, it'll add to the intensity."
871,"This movie is a cinematic piece of art that must not be missed!People complaining that it was drawn out and had no plot are completely missing the point of the movie. It was a psychological analysis of a diathesis stress illness, namely schizophrenia. A man's decent into darkness after a childhood of abuse. It wasn't meant to be a Hollywood blockbuster with fast cars and CGI fighting rubbish.It was utterly necessary to have the elongated beginning, otherwise the brilliant cinematography and score at the conclusion would not have been so impactful.Phoenix, as usual, gave us a masterclass in acting. He lived every tiny schizophrenic moment of Fleck's mind and played it to perfection. If he doesn't win the Oscar this time, I swear I'll never watch it again!For me, this is the movie of the decade. I rarely see a movie twice, but I'm going back for this one a second time. 10 stars."
872,"Favorite movie of the century for me, joaquin phoenix's performance is fenomenal and is definitely one to remember."
873,"This movie is amazing. Great acting that is so good, it gets under your skin. The psychological aspects keep you wondering what you are watching as you come to realize who this person is and why they see the world that they do!"
874,"Joker really is a movie you should think about watching before you actually do see it. It's twisted, demented and true to art imitating life. I squirmed many times due to how close to reality it was. Never expected a movie about a villain to be excruciatingly beautiful. It definitely isn't for everyone and that's fine. Joaquin Phoenix did Joker justice to the point where I was happy to how he came to be."
875,Wow. Just wow. This film has blown me away! An absolute must see... one of the best films I have ever seen! It just gets better and better. A true masterpiece.
876,"I often go to see superhero or villian movies. But today I went to see the joker thinking that was the typical movie with a sad villain with family problems and stuff like that, but no, I GOT AMAZED it was spectacular, the acting of Phoenix got me disturbed it was incredible worth an Oscar and the movie itself was unbelievable, I couldn't stare away from the screen , I never knew what was going to happened and it kept me nervous an exited. 10/10"
877,"Resuming this movie: A guide do madness. The buildup is amazing, from a tender guy with a mind illness to Joker. Reminds a Nolan movie mixed with Scorsese, the atecipation was high and didn't disappoint. Great performance from Phoenix who surely deserves all the prizes he will get."
878,"Joker is awesome. The movie is more about Arthur Fleck dealing with mental illness rather than being Joker, but the movie is awesome! Amazing acting. This movie deserves an Oscar for its amazing performance. Joaquins acting was the best acting I've ever seen. This movie is 1000/10."
879,"Unbelievably awful film about a loser.
The fact that the Joker has made more than US$ 1 billion tells me that society has a whole is as sick and demented as The Joker himself.
Depressing, violent and pointless.
It is impossible to feel sorry for Arthur, he is just human garbage."
880,"OK, the story is nice and the acting is excellent. But the movie suffers from three bad things:1- Boring and uninteresting dialog. There are a lot of them.2- Too slow pace.3- Too lengthy. Too much time for very little number of ideas.These three things combined are more than enough to destroy any movie. It is the first time I have felt that I need to look at the watch to know how much left for the movie to end. Beside this, the genre is supposed to be a thriller in addition to crime and drama, but it is too far from being a thriller.I cannot understand the exaggerated high ratings for this movie. I want to be fair with it. So although it is boring, I give it 4 stars for the story and the acting, but definitely the movie does not worth 5 stars or more. Consequently, I cannot recommend this movie."
881,"I am not surprised . Public routinely overreact to fresh titles. In the future, it will get what it deserves, 6-7 at most."
882,"My wife & I went to the movie today with high expectations given all of the positive reviews by the critics. What a disappointment. About halfway through the movie several people got up and left the theatre. We were tempted to leave, but decided to stay and see how this dark & disturbing movie ended. If you like dark & depressing movies, hate the rich and cops, and relate to the current ""resist"" movement...you'll love this movie. My wife & I like to go to movies to be entertained and leave happy. We couldn't wait for this movie to be over, and are even more concerned about the state of our society now than before we saw the movie given the positive reviews and rating this movie has received. Don't waste your money!"
883,"What's wrong with all you people to find this nasty disturbing movie so great?
Poor human race!"
884,"To be honest, I didn't expect too much from this movie but I had a positive attitude. I mean since it was praised so much by the audience it can't be bad,can it? But boy was I wrong. This movie is inexplicably bad. It has no soul, no excitement and no plot. I really don't get what people see in this crap. It's so predictable and uninteresting. Phoenix put on a good act but, unfortunately, it didn't save the movie for me. And the storyline has nothing to do with origins of the Joker."
885,"Despite the critical acclaim and hype that this film received, I was extrenely disappointed by it...Everyone claimed that this was an ""extremely dark film"", but I honestly found it to be quite laughable...The ""performance"" from Joaquin Phoenix was insincere, pathetic, soulless, and lacked any kind of intensity. Additionally, this film was marketed as a 70's style gritty, exploitation film, ala Taxi Driver, but unfortunately, it was nothing more then a watered down, bloated and dull attempt at rehashing Scorsese's golden era of cinema."
886,Overrated it's normal not bad and not very good either
887,Give this guy an oscar.. man i love his laugh. His joker makup. My favourate line is 'YOU GET WHAT YOU DESERVE'.. love this guy.❤🤡
888,"It's very good movie , i wish to watch it 30 times 😂"
889,"The film is a single cliché: kitchen psychology for simple minds. I find it incomprehensible why this movie has such good ratings.
But, if you look at most of the Profiles, you can see that many here have rated the Joker as the only movie, which could perhaps point to a targeted launch of the studios. The director would have to be trusted, he has served shamelessly in the film on successful motifs of earlier cult films, but without their cult to do justice. No, this movie is bad, boring and predictable. If Ledger had given the joker something more mysterious, this film served everything on the silver tray, and so paltt that it is yawning. Film should leave the space for imagination free, as the Joker generally stands for. And yes, Phoenix does a good job. But is it really a theatrical performance to distort your body like that? For me, the whole thing was almost too much, even his laughter and triggered in me rather a Guidance of Fremdscham, - but not because of the role, but to aim a bit overacting, the ""too much"", the film and the philosophy the director generally seems to have been. Which was also because the movie Phoenix gives little room for character development, which is not on arduous paths. Whenever a point is reached where Phoenix could lend the scroll a little magic, and lift it above the stupidly conceived character, the movie switches to the next scene to tell us more about its stupid geckoes. No, Joker could only make me yawn, and at the same time a horror, a misunderstanding, how stupid people can be, how easy it is to keep the old light copying stories."
890,"I'll sum it up
The role of joker is something to live up to with great actors before
Joaquin Phoenix puts up a great performance
His laugh as well is great
Everything is great"
891,"Yes, the acting was superb, and a lot went into the creation of dark ambience...But... it was NOT an entertaining experience, and left me with a feeling of ...meh...We are not ""insiders"" who react to the technicalities, we are an audience to be entertained.. so, it failed for me!"
892,"Wow so many rave reviews for such a lousy movie. The only thing that was even remotely interesting in the movie was the ending. Other than that the pace was slow and painful. All of the actors did a great job considering the material. But this movie was pure hype for the kiddies to go to the movies. The Joker portrayed here is so far removed from the original comics or past movies that the divide may as well be the Grand Canyon. The Joker we get here is stupid, slow, a born loser and laughs like a moron. A Joker for this type of story needs to be cunning, sly, tough and intelligent. Instead we get a millennial version of Forest Gump that's been dropped too many times on his head."
893,"The movie was truly awful. Had a difficult time staying interested in it or awake. There are hundreds of reviews under 4 stars and I have to agree with all of them so I'll not rehash them here. I found nothing likable about this entire movie other than the Joker's costume at the end. That was stylish. :) His green hair color was a fail. You can't just dye dark hair green, you have to bleach it first to give it some pop.All the 10 star reviews seem to be a clone of each other, copy pasted using the same generic superlatives to praise the film. Words most of the 10 star people probably don't actually understand the definition of.This film had no place in the super hero genre which you usually would take your children to go see. If you took your kid to THIS movie, simply put, you are a horrible parent."
894,"This is beyond a better movie than any ""super hero"" movies out there that has a better score than this film. this movie has a true emotion which you can rare find it anywhere but they captured it in a movie. It's great!"
895,"This is a phenomenal movie with a great story that leaves you to question who's right or wrong and what's real or not, amazing and haunting music, uncomfortable and scary moments but there very well done, beautifully made, and of course Joaquin Phoenix giving a jaw dropping performance. All the other actors do good as well (Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, etc.) but it's Joaquin is what holds the movie together and he totally deserves his Oscar for best actor (Hildur guonadottir Also deserves her Oscar for best original score). My 2nd favorite dc movie and a must watch."
896,"I watched the film on HBO last night. I hadn't read any reviews. I had no idea what the film was about.The Positive: Joaquin Phoenix is an extraordinarily gifted actor and this piece of garbage screenplay was was a great vehicle to showcase his talent.The Negative: Everything else. This movie is about whatever you want it to be about. What is real and what is imagined is up to you, the viewer to determine.What a cop out.I can envision intellectual snobs sipping their brandy and pontificating on the deeper meaning and symbolism of the film.There is none."
897,"All hype and no substance. A pretty mediocre movie hyped up for no reason. Worth a watch if you have a few free hours to spare with nothing better to do or watch, but to rate this above 5 is just crazy."
898,"Yes Pheonix gives a great performance and yes it 'looks' kind of cool - that's all this film has to offer. Superficial, shallow and ultimately void of any substance.The best way I can describe this film is, it's as if a first year film school student was given millions of dollars to have a go. The story does nothing to help you believe that this guy will one day be smart and dangerous enough to hurt Batman - and it MUST do that, it cannot just live in the vacuum of the Directors mind otherwise it's just a story about a weirdo. There has to be SOME respect paid to the canon. Next, the scenes set-ups and shot compositions were so contrived, the story progression was primtive and designed only to make the Joker seem like a pathetic loser that's clearly going to snap - when it happened it was no shock. Neither was it an insightful exploration of mental illness - it was more a cliche version of that rendered in crayons. The dialogue was basic and whilst the imagery was well executed it used very well worn themes of this genre. Totally overrated, a poor film. But audiences these days are easily duped what can I say..."
899,"In a nutshell rubbish on all fronts, where have all the good scripts gone?"
900,"First and foremost, I'm here to explain the perspective from the one who heavily dislike superheroes films. The last superhero film I've seen was Captain America The Winter Solider. I feel that these movies including The Avengers are the reason why we don't see enough quality films nowadays. However, I went to see Joker just because The Dark Knight was my only favorite film in that type of category. And now, Joker is my new first favorite movie from that category.Todd Phillips did amazing job by bringing his comedian talent into a seriously dark film. Since he is known for his love of documentary films, he created a ""documentary"" about Joker that parallel to the days in early 1980s. It was when the USA society had shifted to the conservative right after Ronald Regan became the president. Regan removed the New Deal and reduced the tax for rich people. The fund for people mentality ill had gone down. The unemployment rate was 7.2%. The emergence of capitalism had occurred.Joker was an example of people who were stuck in the decline of social mobility. Poor, lonely, and rejection had evolved him into a villain and led him to seek revenge for rich people. 11:11 was found in several scenes, and it was a symbol of twin flames, referring a domino effect of actions when people becoming richer or poorer. The character of Joker was referred to John Gacy for this particular reason.I found this interesting where people were saying that Joker was shown at wrong time, especially after the shooting incidents. I thought the release date was a perfect timing due to the upcoming of one of the most important presidential elections in American history. I'm absolutely the fact that Joker film is at least a factor into the decision making for our next president.ANOTHER MASTERPIECE!"
901,"You either LOVE this film or you HATE it. Plain and simple, sure there's people that find the middle ground between rating it 5-8 /10 but those are the people who see the flaws, and don't like them, or the ones who see the flaws, but thinks they help the movie more. Joker is a middle finger to the society we live in. Joker IS a satire, society sees your troubles and laughs in your face. VERY good film and it's a 10/10 without question. If you don't agree that's fine, if you think it's a 1/10 that's fine too. It's not a film meant for everyone."
902,"Honestly people who have rated this movie as a ""masterpiece"" need to start watching some actual masterpieces. Predictable over indulgent and simplistic (not in a good way). You could see every ""climax"" 10 mins before it happens. Good things and why I have it 4. 1.Score 2.Cinematography 3.Art direction 4.Music choiceFilm makers need to start making some good films!"
903,"Story of corruption and mental illness , day dream your life away because your life is not going the way you want it to be. This movie has amazing cinematography , not great of punch lines , more sarcastic then scary which I preferred the opposite. Great acting form Joaquin I can't think of someone else now days to be a joker better than him.Good movie not that great. no scene or a line stuck in mind. Not a ""masterpiece""."
904,"Joker is a masterpiece work of savage art. I never thought I would see a better performance and rendition of Joker than Heath Ledger but Joaquin Phoenix is it.I was fixated on this film and couldn't take my eyes off of it. It plays with your heart and mind. It makes you grapple with morality, society, concept of evil, and how society deals with mental illness and the treatment of the mentally ill.It moves like an orchestra and Joker is the conductor. His dancing in the film captures his performance on the Stage of Life. Oscar Wilde said, ""The world is a stage, but the play is badly cast.""I also enjoyed the concept of ""comedy"" and how Joker views ""jokes."" He sees the worst in life as the true comedy and laughs at how he must deal with it in his violence.*Joker laughing*Dr: ""What's so funny?""Joker : ""I was just thinking about a joke.""*Joker laughing more*"
905,"A modern Neo-noir crime drama which begs the philosophical question of acceptance in the society and dares to ask hard question on the role society plays in the making of a criminal. Beautifully acted, perfectly directed, magnificently shot, the movie transcends the genre film making with a hint scorseseism violence and story telling. The performance of joaquin phoenix is beyond imagination, the actor outdid himself."
906,"Was never into the whole comic book thing (the last Batman I saw was played by Michael Keaton) but this film was sold to me on the basis that it's more a portrayal of one man's descent into madness than a CGI-fuelled superhero adventure.Comparisons with Taxi Driver and The King Of Comedy certainly helped (not to mention the presence of the star of both of those films, Robert De Niro), as well as the leading man, an actor of whom I'm quickly becoming a devoted fan, Joaquin Phoenix. With all this considered, I armed myself with the extremely scant knowledge of the Batman universe that I possess and off to the pictures I went.Well, what I and the packed cinema saw was an acting tour de force. I never saw Heath Ledger's legendary portrayal of the titular character but I really don't know how it can beat Phoenix's portrayal here. Admittedly, I think I'm right in saying that Ledger portrayed Joker whereas for most of this film, Phoenix is portraying Arthur Fleck and perhaps that's why I enjoyed it so much. There's no denying that Joker is an intensely interesting character but for me, seeing the human behind the face-paint and his tumultuous unravelling is far more fascinating than the monster he becomes.Much has been made of how dark this film is and that is certainly true; how it is a 15 certificate is more a sign of the times than anything because this film pulls no punches. The violence is, at times, extremely graphic and the portrayal of a man so troubled is often deeply unsettling. All of which, set against a relentlessly grim Gotham backdrop, is utterly necessary to give the film the atmosphere and the feel it requires but I did wonder how this film will sit in a franchise that, while not explicitly aimed at kids, nevertheless appeals to younger audiences the way Batman always has. 'The Dark Knight Rises' was a 12A; Joker should really be an 18 and trust me, you really don't want to be taking your kids to see it if you want them to get a good night's sleep afterwards.What isn't in any doubt is the extraordinary performance Joaquin Phoenix delivers in the title role. He has always been a very dependable actor and has given some incredible performances over the years ('Walk The Line' and 'You Were Never Really Here' to name but two) but here, one gets the sense that he is throwing absolutely everything he has at the role. As well as a physical transformation (he clearly lost an awful lot of weight to attain the skeletal physique required), Phoenix brings a manic intensity to the part that is, at times, hugely uncomfortable to watch but is never anything less than utterly fascinating and absorbing.It is unnerving because even for someone like me who has such a flimsy knowledge of the Batman story, there is a strange contradiction in the sadness and pity felt for a character who one knows is going to become one of pop culture's great supervillains; a murderous madman who will come to thrive on anarchy, violence, death and destruction. For most of the film though, he isn't Joker, he is Arthur Fleck, a sympathetic character exposed to the violence, the mockery and the ostracisation that those on the edge of society suffer all too often. With what's thrown at him, it is no wonder that he eventually snaps and fights back in the most spectacular and public way.I might have got even more from this film if I had any interest in the comic book world but it says a lot about Joker that I was able to watch this as a stand-alone film and leave the cinema utterly mesmerised by what I'd seen. Director Todd Phillips' vision aside though, all praise has to go to Phoenix for delivering such a pained, intense, visceral and thrilling performance. In lesser hands, it could have felt cheap and exploitative but not here. I can't say either way whether this is a sensitive portrayal of mental illness but then again, Arthur's specific condition isn't explicitly defined and also, this is a fictional character whose defining feature, his greatest weapon, is that he is ""insane"" (for want of a better word).Already, there have been debates about whether or not the portrayal is healthy and there are arguments on both sides. I don't know for sure but if nothing else, some good will surely come from increasing the spotlight on what it means to suffer from mental illness. The film itself, while set in a fictional city in an undefined timeframe, does touch upon issues that are seemingly timeless.The lack of funding or of proper care for those living with mental illness is explicitly referred to in the film and are highlighted as major factors in Arthur's continuing decline. The therapist who just repeats the same questions, the lack of funding for proper care, the constant mockery from those who don't understand; these are all daily battles waged by those living with mental illness. Of course, in reality, said sufferers very, very seldom reach a point whereby they turn violent (or indeed murderous) and wreak revenge on society. Their battle to be heard and to get proper care, however, is all too common.This is just one debate that the film will ignite but great cinema always does that and for me, 'Joker' is great cinema with a performance at its heart that surely cannot go unrewarded when Awards Season comes around. Certain scenes will stay with you long after the credits have rolled, debates will be had, lines will be quoted and meaning will be attempted to be extracted from what the viewer has seen. THAT is what only great cinema provides.8.5/10"
907,"This movie is an absolute piece of art I've never been Soo happy and thrilled to see a movie until this
it's defrent and real and just amazing"
908,I went to the movie with high expectations from the overall positive reviews and it still blow my mind.Joaquin Phoenix with an Oscar worthy performance.Not to forget the absolute brilliance of the team behind the movies soundtrack.Well done. Very well done.
909,"I did not find a single scene that I did not like, the photography in this movie is excellent. I cried in the beginning, I only laughed 3 or 4 times (no forced jokes) and i left the cinema complete. You see the side b of gotham's past and although you can empathize with Arthur but only the politically correct thing could complain about such a jewel, it bothers them but we love it. The comic genre needs more movies like this and less comedy."
910,"""you are making fun of it, but it was serious to me""dem this scene still gives me chills since last night.
its rare to spot a good thriller with a decent suspense and ending nowadays, guess Christopher Nolan has raised the bar too high.but maaaan, Joaquin and Todd have just proved me wrong, Joker wasn't just great, but motha-****ingly AMAZING. The performance, cinematography, screenplay, storyline, music etc were absolutely stunning. It's not just a movie but also a whistleblower, a HUGE message to the world out there of what's still going on in our society.you can't compare Joaquin to Heath, they are both Ronaldo and Messi. If Joaquin doesn't win the Oscar and Joker doesn't win AT LEAST the best screenplay, it'll be the biggest joke of all time.Joker is something else."
911,"I have waited this movie since Todd Phillip's announcement of this movie. Great Story, Great Acting, Great Score. JOKER deserve an Oscar Nomination. Joaquin Phoenix deserve An Oscar for his performance."
912,"Is it that the Joker is justified in becoming a serial killer because he was abused as a child and was attacked on the street and on the subway?Or is he justified in becoming a mass murderer because people didn't laugh at his jokes, and a famous person made fun of him on TV about not being funny?Or is it that we should be more careful about letting a mentally disturbed person get a gun?Or is it that we should prevent a private person from giving a gun to someone else without official background checks?Or is it that our society is so messed up that one logical response is to become a wacked-out maniac who goes around murdering people who have done him wrong?Or is it something else?One thing it is NOT, is entertainment. This movie is about as enjoyable as swimming in sewage.The 4 stars is because it was well-written, the plot was logical, and it succeeded in making you feel bad for the Joker. And because Joaquin Phoenix did a great acting job.But what is the point of this movie? Is it to say that we must stand by as society collapses into a putrid mess? That the bad guy will ultimately win? No thanks."
913,"It is whatever you want it to be. If you want to hate it, you'll hate it. If you want to love it, you'll love it. Be optimistic."
914,This was the best movie of 2019 a TRUE must watch so much better than Endgame even better than the dark knight trilogy best movie of 2019!!!!
915,I can't believe there are this many people wasting their lives by reviewing even before seeing them.
916,"I wonder why DC licensed the brand to Todd n Co. The character (Arthur Fleck) never creates any chaos by himself, no manipulation n threat stuff, no explosions, no gunpowders. In short, there's very little this Joker does other than just borrowing the costume and signature laugh from the iconic character. Of course one could argue that it's a character in it's early stages before transforming into the supervillain. But then what's the fun in watching just another psychopath movie with a troubled psychotic patient getting bullied and disregarded by society. Honestly, I've seen a ton of movies with a similar plot. To make matter worse, the character doesn't even turn a villain at the end of the movie. JOKER is a mediocre attempt psychotic thriller movie which doesn't do justice to the title. The movie could've worked better as an independent film without the unnecessary portrayal of the legendary character."
917,"Unbelievable drivil, totally incredulous rubbish, not worthy Of a trip to blockbusters"
918,This movie is total garbage boring and dumb. Movie feels like it was shot over one weekend.. the same weekend they wrote it
919,A weak and worthless story of a cold-blooded psycho. And without attractiveness and excitement of the story! Like a mother who doesn't know a new story and she tells worthless things to her child.
920,"Wow. I can't believe what I watched. Not in a good way. Although the filmmakers said this was ""king of comedy"" or ""taxi driver"" it most certainly is not. Sorry to be saying this. I wanted to love it so much, and it was only reaching an entertaining moment in the last 15 min when it actually starts turning into a comic book movie. Although Joaquin created a very deep and dark Joker, he has nobody to bounce off of. The character in a Batman or actual Arkham Asylum scenario would be very interesting I didn't find this version very interesting. Also unfortunately I don't see anything in this Joker movie that makes me think Todd Phillips could reach anything close to Taxi Driver. There were a lot of topics touched on (race, poverty, mental health, comedy) that never really felt like they hit a real point of view."
921,"The hype the movie generated did absolutely injustice to the film.
The actor did a pretty good job but the screenplay and story is too much boring. The first half its bearable but the last half really let down the film entirely. One of the worst films ever to get such a huge IMDB ratings ever.Wasted my 2 hours completely."
922,"I was always sure that Joaquin Phoenix is a very good actor, but after the Joker I am convinced he is one of the best. I say one of the best because there are many other actors with extra ordinary performance and it is hard to say who is the best.
This film hypnotized me: the story, the director, music, the performance...
This is one of rare cases when I would watch it again."
923,"The hype of this movie definitely succeeds my expectations. The cinematography, music, and the acting was perfect. There is clearly a reason why Joaquin Phoenix won the Oscar for this performance. He really delved into his character and there was not a single moment where he went out of character. The story is very dark and quite depressing, but the director did his job in making it work and allowing the audience to see a different side of who we interpret as the 'Joker'."
924,"Like this movie or not, you have to agree its at least a breath of fresh air. Phoenix does a great job at channeling just the right amount of psycho to portray the Joker.The cinematography and lighting is very well done and really sets the atmosphere. While I agree with some that the morales of the movie can be misconstrued, it seems to be about coming out of your shell to be your true self and not caring what others think.I did feel at times the movie was a bit preachy though. The whole ""we live in a society..."" comes off rather strong towards the end. Society and rich people = bad!! That was a bit too on the nose.I also never really got the notion that this Joker was clever or intelligent in this movie. He just seemed psychotic. Which is really only a small part of what makes the character scary.Now, I get that its from the Jokers point of view, but the Waynes and almost ALL other characters are just shown to be total one dimensional a-holes that we dont really have sympathy for. This could have been handled better I believe.BUT, what makes these bad things listed above so interesting, is the very real possibility that the events in the film were actually all in the Jokers mind. Its established early on that he has delusions often, so the entire revolution and his rise to hero status could have very well been all imagined, which makes a lot of sense.In conclusion though, I appreciated the risks the movie took and performance given by Phoenix. It was a fresh take on an already well established character, which can be difficult to do. And considering all of the god awful movies released now a days, I cant blame people who praise it as a perfect 10. Its deff worth it to give it a watch for yourself."
925,"Watched it on day one, it's more than two months and I still have goosebumps. The movie isn't that original, isn't something that you haven't seen before, but it's original in its purpose and vision. Todd, Joaquin and the whole working team had made one of the most iconic movies of all time portraying a different and original version of the Joker we all know but he's a metal ill, twisted and a suffering man that tries to be loved, understood, he wants his tears to be dried and he wants to be one of us, but he can't, he knows he can't and for that he'll become something else, choosing a path that himself seems to not accept. Joker earns 10 stars from me, not only because it's a magnificent movie, but because it's easily recognisable and it will stuck in your minds as most of icons movies from the past has done with your mind. Last but not least: Oscar-worthy ? All-in."
926,"This was a brilliant film! A difficult watch, but a very important film that shows how mental health and childhood trauma can affect a person's life choices. Joaquin Phoenix was amazing! A true method actor, his depiction of the person that becomes the Joker was breathtaking. It was a travesty that he was never nominated for an Oscar for Walk the line but this will be a travesty if he doesn't win it."
927,"I guess it's a completely failed script. This is more like a documentary of a person with a mental illness than a normal human drama. The protagonist is suffering from the beginning, so cannot be taken as a normal human drama. It's like watching a mental illness to meet something what make him worse. The main story involves the issue of income inequality, but it's just deviates the theme. It is should be omitted . Or does the director want to say that mental illness cannot be saved because of bad society? And the climax is bad. The hero has explained something in the climax. A movie expresses what cannot be explained in words, and the climax protagonist must not explain the theme in words. I've never seen such a worst climax recently. So I laughed out there.
But this climax has been, in some ways, a success. There was enough excitement about unexpectable and what would he to do. A climax is important for a movie, and if the climax is fun without reason, the impression of whole movie will be great. I think that the climax has a great influence that many people give this work a high evaluation. The protagonist shouted something like the theme, but it was covered with the performance output and it was quite impressive. The story is covered by beautiful photography, camera work, and music. In this sense, this is the movie. The photos are very beautiful, especially because of the talent of the photographer. So the impression after watching this movie was not disgusting. Despite this terrible story, this point is where most people give high score. That's a movie. Therefore, I would give rather high rate such a movie what is in a sense a masterpiece. In a sense a trash..
And the directoer is the director of The Hangover, I expect of his next work."
928,"I've never wrote a review, I regret every rating I've ever given a movie because of the tens I've put that pale in comparison to this masterpiece. What an amazing flick. Words can not describe the brilliance of Phoenix. Masterful. Mesmerizing."
929,"The film introduce us the idea of the joker and it can be inspire be everyone who have a mental issue not you should fall in a chemical tank to become the joker, it's all it need just a little push"
930,"Watched this in theathre, everyone including me was glued to see the transformation of Arthur.To me, this movie simply is 'almost perfect'."
931,J.phoenix is astonishing in this gripping story of how the joker came to be.do not miss this movie.
932,"In my opinion Joker is a flawless movie. The dedicated way Joaquin Phoenix portrays the character is so unique you just have to appreciate it. The character development throughout the movie is some of the best I've ever seen and the cinematography was absolutely stunning. I was hooked for the 2 hours the movie lasted. I think if you appreciate movies as a form of art you must think this is one of the best movies out there, if you're just looking for a superhero movie to watch then you probably won't like it that much."
933,"I consider Joker another masterpiece. Brilliant storyline, outstanding direction and writing by Todd Philips, staggeringly suspenseful score, vivid cinematography and above all, Joaquin Phoenix's mesmerizing and sublime performance as the Joker. I was speechless with astonishment by the end of this film. To reiterate, Heath Ledger would've loved this masterpiece; I wish he was still alive today. Joaquin Phoenix's embodiment of an ordinary man who gradually transforms into Gotham's most mercurial, menacing, and diabolical criminal through his mentality and despair caused by rejection and humiliation from society was a central pillar of this film. In my experience, I was seeing Joker, not Joaquin Phoenix, for the entire movie through his erratic behavior, abnormal laughter, and irresistible dance moves. He has once again proven himself an extraordinary actor. The suspenseful score complements the dark theme as it strongly implies Arthur Fleck's imminent downfall. Although the ending was quite intense, I truly consider this as an Oscar-worthy movie that deserves the utmost recognition."
934,This is one of the best movies of this year. And i really expect it to be nominated for an oscar. It's not related to DCEU . And it was beyond my expectations.
935,"I like all kind of movies, but this one was a continuous paranoia of a messed up guy, well played by the actor, without giving me a sense of entertainment of some sort, so all those great reviews mislead you in going to this film."
936,"Phoenix really did this role with a new style. It's REALLY PERFECT... Pheonix roll is CRAZY! I am a Joker top fan and I really loved it. The plot is amazing, and most importantly the message! Now Ledger is a thing and Pheonix is another. Everyone of them has his own style and taste. We can't compare them they're both great, even though they complete each other."
937,Never thought anyone could perform the joker character better then heath ledger. I think the dc fans will love the movie but it wont be for everyone but i would say give it a try and decide your self dont rely only on the reviews.Strong points of this film are the story background score and performances specaily the joker if your looking for all these things in a film then this is for you.
938,I loved his performance as the Joker however not a fan of the anti police and anti rich rhetoric surrounding the movie. It felt like Antifa ish - anger at just anyone in general . That's where I tuned out
939,"Not as good as i thought, too much overrated by people"
940,"I've seen the word ""masterpiece"" attached to many, many reviews, so much so that I can't help but wonder if there's a coordinated effort. If so, this review is not part of that effort.Let's get into it - Joaquin Phoenix does a really good job in this role, especially when in his Joker costume - there were times when he seemed to be channeling Heath Ledger. Although, I have to confess that without his Joker makeup, his face reminded me of Ty Burrell, who plays Phil Dunphy on Modern Family - they really look similar to me. And since Phil Dunphy is such a harmless character, it sort of took me out of the moment. Regardless, Joaquin did a great job.Now, the story? Well, that was a little less impressive to me. I've heard people say that the Joker was an unreliable narrator, which is true, but I don't know if that necessarily makes this a better movie. I think the movie is definitely a showcase of a character with mental illness, which makes me think of Heath Ledger's line: ""Why so serious?""Also, I learned afterward that this movie is disconnected from the overall D.C. cinematic universe, which I find odd. I mean, it's a fairly decent portrayal of the Joker, so why put it in its own little bubble universe? To my mind, that basically makes this movie a glorified fan fiction, and again, begs the question, ""why?""Anyway, I think the movie is worth seeing, as much of it is well done. However, it's not one that I feel any urge to rewatch. My two cents."
941,"This movie can makes you feel the bitterness, the sadness, the whole psychopathic transition
A perfect impact
You would definitely after this movie understand the Joker
Good music
good directed
Amazing actor :Joaquin phoenix
The best character development i ever seen"
942,Simply amazing. Could have stayed and watched it again. Wish it had been longer. Absolutely phenomenal film. Epic.
943,Joaquin Phoenix's performance in joker is amazing everything about this movie is amazing. Amazing script great acting 10/10 you need to see this movie
944,"AMAZING. HAUNTING. STUNNING. SAD. REALISTIC. BEAUTIFUL.I love Joaquin Phoenix in anything he does because he masterfully embodies his character.The cinematography. The music. The score. The mood. The chilling unpredictability. The deliberate pace of the development. The plot line. The twists.... Just about everything about this film is perfect example of a perfect film!Wayne Manor?
That dancing?
The joker in jeans smoking?
The unraveling?
Robert DeNiro?!Suffice it to say, I've already pre-ordered.*Forget the critics reviews (NYT, I'm disappointed)
*Forget nit picky reviewers rating 7s because they don't like the somber score or because there wasn't enough bloodshed; spellcheck before you rate. LOL"
945,"Great film and didn't get bored!I'd been told not much happened but couldn't take my eyes off the screen..Went pretty dark at times but I think it needed to, a fantastic performance from Joaquin & Bob!Go see it people.."
946,"The ultimate goal of the film is to make you uncomfortable. Does it succeed? It really does. This movie isn't for everyone, but it's a very unique and well-done film with top notch acting."
947,"This movie constructs itself in a very slow pace but in an extremely gratifying way, every action that is shown deteriors Arthur's sanity, making us feel not pity but discomfort and disgust with everything around us but fading away with joy and calmness as the movie reachs the climax in a rush, the signs of anxiety and madness in Arthur constantly increases and breaks through the audience flawlessly. A great rollercoaster of emotions that most of the people will feel identified with."
948,I don't have words to explain the acting of Joker. Outstanding performance- What a legend. The Oscar is sure.
949,"Greetings from Lithuania.I will be honest - i did not expected ""Joker"" (2019) to be this amazing movie. I saw trailer, i liked it, then read that it is heavily influenced on ""Taxi Driver"" and ""King of Comedy"" and thought that its going to be at least an interesting and not by a numbers comic book movie. And i was right - its far from any comic book movie i have seen ever, except for ""Logan"" and ""Dark Knight"". Well, know there is a ""Joker"". What made those two films exceptional? Its that they went beyond and in different direction then you conventional PG13 comic book flicks from Marvel. ""Joker"" on the other hand is a great character study movie - first thing. If you would remove Gotham city and some characters from Batman universe, this film wouldn't even had anything to do with comic book movies. The other thing is that its just superbly done - this is hands down best movie Todd Phillips has ever made (and i loved first ""Hangover""). Cinematography was gorgeous and very stylish, music was haunting and editing was top notch - this film at its running time 2 h run like wind for me. Oh ye, and then there is the best performance of the year (so far) by Joaquin Phoenix - his Joker i think stands on the same ground with a legendary performance by Heath Ledger - its that amazing, and a bit even more complex because in Dark Knight Joker was a side character - in here he is a central figure, and what a great character that was.Overall, ""Joker"" is a great character study movie, and a very unique comic book film. Its different, for sure and make no mistake its great not because its different - its because the bold direction creators have went with it and delivered it full. This is one of the very best films this year so far."
950,"This is probably the most cringe and edgy movie I have seen in my entire life, but i guess that's what people love now day so whatever"
951,Amazing the movie was great and they could've of done it any better Joaquin is the best actor and I enjoyed him as the joker and Todd Philips performance was really good at setting this movie out to be the best thing I have saw in a long time and I think he is the best joker in my opinion
952,"This movie was something else. I feel like I needed therapy after watching it. It evokes a lot of strange feelings from you whilst watching. I found it to be more like a work of art than just another movie about Batman and Joker. The impact it had speaks volumes about the quality of the production. Unfortunately it's not my cup of tea, I don't enjoy dark movies as much which is why I scored it lower."
953,A complete standout film. Unbelievable performances and totally gripping direction.
954,"Title says it all
This movie isnt deep as you 7 year old brains think. Everything in movie is so surface level that a baby can understand it othervise you will be bored.
It is 5 cause there are good things in the movie but all this praise comes from people that never seen any other movie than comic movies or fast and furious and neckbeards and also people that never gone out of their house and think the world is like in this movie."
955,"I really get it if someone says its too depressing for me. Otherwise this is a fantastic film in every aspect. Acting, Story, Editing, Music, engagement, suspense and even comedy. It's ridiculous how good this movie is."
956,Absolute masterpiece. It shows what Arthur fleck was going through. loved joaquin
957,"This movie rips your heart out and rearranges your insides. This is one of those movies that makes you want to make films. The soundtrack, the cinematography, and the performances are perfect. A fantastic movie and a great setting in 1970s-80s NYC. Great commentary on how we treat people we don't understand! Definitely worth watching multiple times!"
958,He was made for this movie and this movie was made for him.
959,"First thing I'll say is, I am not a huge DC fan. The dark knight I found a good film however not as good as people make out, so I went into this movie thinking I'd enjoy it but not really talk about it, my god how I was wrong. This movie is an absolute masterpiece, the character development of the Joker is the best I've ever seen, and it had me on the edge of my seat at moments. Easily say this is in my top 3 favourite movies of all time and after my second watch (later tonight lol) I'll decide for good if it's the top spot, which it could well beTreat yourself and watch it"
960,"This movie is nothing but an over rated flix by the psycho teens when compared to what Nolan had given us. Joaquin Phoenix is a great actor, I agree. But he couldn't tally with 'The Heath Ledger'. Also,what this film lacks is a good script and direction. Now you may think me as a Nolanist, but I doubt you would do the same after you watch this. The film failed to give the kind of satisfaction you would get after Dark Knight.Let me point out one or two things:1. I felt like the Joaquin's joker had a feminine shade. Especially towards the end of the movie. This is in contrast with Nolan's joker.2. Joaquin's joker aimed for fame and notoriety. However, the previous joker wouldn't even know what he was doing
the mischiefs for, if you asked him.3. The script is mellow at places and as a result of the same the movie loses its pace here and there.
My verdict again : Overrated, grossly."
961,"''Joker"" is a great story of Arthur Fleck, a man who is driven to insanity by the his life experiences and his current life. Arthur lives alone with his mother, Penny. After being fired from his job after a incident. Arthur learns that the world isn't his best friend. On the way home, 3 men attack Arthur, leading him to draw a gun and violently killing the men. This leads to a series of killing and revolts as the poverty-struck citizens try and give their message to kill the rich of Gotham.The movie was incredible and I strongly recommend this movie to anybody who loves movies and incredible acting."
962,"Watch the best movie ever made genius JOKER. Like the best movie ever seen. Not so happy or funny but just incredible, you really really shud watch him!!!"
963,"Well deserved oscars, Phoenix did great, Everybody should watch this movie."
964,"Bruh......
Seriously one of the best movies I've ever seen. The combination of the Acting, Direction, Music and Cinematography makes this movie a surprise triumph."
965,"Todd Phillips (The Hangover guy) wrote, produced and directed this origin story for the Joker character from DC Comics 'Batman.' It features a powerhouse performance from Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a clown for hire by day, and a wannabe stand up comedian at night. Suffering from a medical condition that causes him to laugh at inappropriate times, Arthur finds that the joke always seems to be on him. Caught in a cynical existence between apathy and cruelty, he makes one bad decision that brings about a chain reaction of escalating events in this gritty character study. Phillips's film is a rare beast, a comic book movie which non comic book fans will probably appreciate more. It pays tribute to the 1970's and early 80's films of Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro (who appears here as a manipulative TV chat show host), particularly King of Comedy and Taxi Driver. Hildur Guðnadóttir composed the the film's score, which she wrote simultaneously alongside the music for the TV miniseries Chernobyl. As well as original music, it features the songs ""That's Life"", ""Send In the Clowns"", ""White Room,"" and controversially, ""Rock and Roll Part 2,"" by convicted child sex offender Gary Glitter (who did not receive a penny In royalties)"
966,I could feel all the emotions this movie projects. It just pulls you in. Unbelievable performance by Joaquin Phoenix.
967,"Great performance, great humor, great movie in general. Showing you a movie about mental illness and the struggle of society."
968,"I was recently watching of this movie and didn't understand the hype, I thought everyone was over exaggerating. I thought this was gonna be another Suicide Squad because of the trailer. Instead it was a incredibly well-written story with lots of thought behind it. This is one of the most tragic movies I've ever seen and I might rewatch this movie. Definitely a good movie that you should watch if you've not seen it!"
969,"Ive watched this film twice now and it still impresses me from start to finish Joaquin Phoenix done amazing from the weight loss to the laugh and the way the joker should be betrayed a man who doesnt fit in socitey with it keep breaking and bringing him down for him to finally loose it, so happy he got the Oscar for this"
970,Acting was superb from Joaquin Phoenix and the atmosphere in the movie was brilliant. One of my favorite movies now.
971,I can write only it's really good film. And Joaquin Phoenix was the best joker ever
972,"Real life,real stuggle,real sadness.Every person can compare to him.Masterpiece!"
973,"Never ever i felt a character this much. joaquin did outstanding work, an awe inspiring performance. this movie should really encourage people to think a bit more about where we are as a society and what we can do for each other to ease the pain we carry everyday. thank you to everyone who worked on this ."
974,I think it's an instant classic and its my favorite film of 2019
975,7/10 For the acting and the idea that what we do or say always have consequences. Anything else is ok.
976,Joker was very well done. The cinematography and camera work was very well done. Joaquin absolutely nailed his character and was able to display the heartbreak of a broken society that betrayed him. The score of the film was incredible and the story was perfect.
977,"I don't like violent films and I don't like comic books and comic book characters. That being said, I LOVED ""Joker""--as a former New Yorker, I loved the ""mood"" and lighting of this film's ""city,"" the ""characters"" you will only find in this crazy place, the lifestyle and intensity and madness that doesn't exist anywhere else on the planet and only really exists if you yourself are living somewhat on the edge. It's Bellevue and St. Vincent's and The Pyramid Club and every seedy street corner from ""Law and Order SVU"" rolled into one. Joaquin Phoenix is SO brilliantly uncomfortable you might check yourself in just to make sure you are still relatively the same person you were before you agreed to see this film."
978,"The I really enjoyed this film I barely noticed the run time, the character development is believable and a great challenge to societal hierarchy.
The cinematography is spectacular and the scenes are strong and emotional.
However sadly the plot does suffer generic points but that's not to worry because the film is mainly a character study, and how he develops and changes as the world continues to screw people like him over and look the other way.
Seeing who is at the start and how he becomes the man at that end is a remarkable journey I will be more than glad to embark upon again"
979,"Well this was brilliantly done,what can i say the movie is such a tragic story that as you mind blown away in the finals minutes of the end. the sadness of one human life so tragically intense but yet so psychotic
very well put together and very well acted.This leaves you wonder by the end how much of that was in his mind and how much was real.over the last decade DC and Marvel have had too many pretty boys to play pretty parts and had way to much CGI and Photoshopwhat we have here was a raw character played and played without any facades
#JoaquinPhoenix did this movie justice he created something bigger than the writer ever anticipated , now he has raised the bar they need ( the writers) to deliver the sequel"
980,Incredible one of the best films ever made. I went in with high hopes and it delivered and then some.
981,"There are tons of reviews focusing on the extraordinary acting of Joaquin Phoenix, so I am skipping that part. I would like to make comments on the heated discussion that whether this movie glorifies the violence.Right off the ""bat"", I think it doesn't. Joker beautifully portrays how villains/monsters emerge and rise to power in a society.The dominant Western culture dictates that being good or bad is a completely personal choice and no society should be blamed for the rotten apples among them. On the other hand, leftist approaches tend to put the blame on the socio-economical structures of a society and they claim that the system produces such abnormalities.This fine piece of art takes a balanced attitude that blends the two extreme wiews summarized above. Arthur was a mentally disturbed person long before emerging as the Joker. He was delusional, depressed, and he had many social anxieties to prevent him of being a functioning member of a society. So, why did he become a villain, among many other troubled people? Because the society he lives in was corrupted and it was causing unrest. Ordinary people were already looking for an icon to channel their rages and discontent towards.So, for a true villain to rise, there must be a perfect combination of personal and sociological conditions. In the absence of psychological troubles, the villain candidate can't go the extra mile and endure such a depraving journey. On the other hand, in the absence of a truly corrupt and disgusting societal background, actions of a villain candidate would be considered unnecessary violent acts and as a result, the masses would not approve him/her. This is one of the main reasons why the people don't embrace lone wolf attacks nowadays. Despite all the problems they have, societies don't need a villain and that's why the villain candidates are mostly labelled as the depraved crazies.To wrap it up, the movie doesn't glorify the violence at all. It demonstrates the psychological and sociological conditions of a villain emerging and being widely accepted by an imaginary society. Actually, it's a free lesson for the policymakers all around the world. If you invest on the mental health of individuals and rule them fairly, the Joker can't be around."
982,"If you have been avoiding the movie Joker (2019) because you think it belongs to the superhero genre and the violent world of masked crusaders then you are making a mistake. Just like I did. Set aside preconceptions and see what is one of the most powerfully introspective portraits of mental illness you will ever find on film - and Batman is nowhere to be seen.Set in Gotham City in the recent pre-digital age, the story opens with Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) struggling to live a normal life, hold a job, and care for his ageing mother. Abused as a child, he relies on medication for his cocktail of mental disorders, the most prominent of which is a condition where anxiety can trigger bursts of hysterical laughter (Pseudobulbar Affect). City Hall cuts back on support services and Arthur's untreated conditions escalate as he becomes more vulnerable to abuse, loses his job, and his dream of becoming a stand-up comic is cruelly exploited. With nothing to gain or lose, all that is left is vengeance.
This plotline is merely a narrative framework for what is a phenomenal performance by Phoenix. His chiselled features, balletic body language, and elastic facial contortions have extraordinary power to express disconnectedness from the material world. As he endures the torments of an uncaring society, we become immersed in his value system where violence makes perfect sense.The film was always going to generate controversy for its depiction of violence. However, it remains on the 'art' side of gratuitous and is more restrained than so many other violent but non-controversial films. The soundtrack and cinematography are edgy, and the camerawork is often so close to Arthur you can see the pores of his skin sweating fury at those around him. The film is visually engrossing: the sets ooze gothic decay, dystopian chaos, and streets full of vagrants and the dispossessed. The film's two-hour running time feels like one.Phoenix single-handedly drives this film and he deserves critical acclaim. It was risky to bypass the usual magical fantasy of super-heroes and super-villians and take a serious look at a serious issue. Entertainment can be a powerful platform for education. While the script retains the tropes of Marvel Comics, it shows insight into mental illness with lines like ""What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash? What you deserve""."
983,Wow just totally mesmerizing played so well by Phoenix his character was truly believable and you see the joker evolve into The Joker. It gives me chills seeing who he actually was as a person it was breathtaking. Such a good movie to watch
984,Superb movie and superb acting. What a brilliant performance by Phoenix.
985,"The making of a villain, a killer, and a monster. From the beginning, despair, provocation, and simmering which leaves us with our boiling point, Joker. Amazing dedication to the character and a chilling movie to watch! Two thumbs up"
986,Absolutely amazing. This movie deserved a standing ovation at the end. The acting was incredible and had you at the edge of your seat. This will become an all time classic!
987,"The movie is very good. But it is definitely overrated. I really don't understand what the buzz was all about. All i have to say is,i'm happy i waited to watch it at home. Worth watching? Absolutely. Just lower your expectations and u will enjoy it as i did."
988,I really don't know how to discribe it it was the BESTTTT
989,I guess why everyone is in shock is this is the reason you need better health care for everybody
990,"According to one ""WOKE"" blogger an ""intellectually ludicrous and philosophically empty"" film. That would make Joker laugh ... they just don't get it do they...
Joaquin has taken on the impossible task of breathing life back into Joker after Heaths legendary occupation of that ""unsafe space"". And just like Lazarus, Joker rises from the dead. Joaquin is the only actor who could ever have pulled this off. It is an outstanding performance. In the old days, when the Oscars actually rewarded talent, this would have been a sure bet for best actor. Now the Oscars are ""WOKE"", not a chance. Joaquins physical transformation for this role stunned me. Not as shocking as Christian Bales for The Machinist, but impressive.
In an attempt to get the public NOT to see this film, the ""WOKE"" have spread disinformation that mass shooters dressed as Joker are targeting film screenings.
And Joker laughs again."
991,"Jaoqin Phoenix is incredible as he engulfs the character of Arthur Fleck and then, the Joker. You sympathise with his character as his life descends into pain and mental suffering. You see the Arthur's life deteriorate down a path of terror. Impressive film with disturbing scenes. I fear if the film is seen by someone vulnerable with aggressive tendencies it may influence their behaviour for the worse."
992,"Joker is a contemporary example of a chef-d'oeuvre. It's a monumental piece of art. In essence, it's a masterpiece. Joker stars Joaquin Phoenix in a once in a lifetime portrayal of an iconic comic book villain. Barring any connection to the source material, Joker stands on its own as a film that will be upheld in the annals of the decade's best films.Joker stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a mentally unstable man who is trying to find his place in a society that rejects him. Phoenix's portrayal of Arthur is perfection. Phoenix captures the essence of life with mental illness. In a career with so many masterful character portrayals, this is the one that viewers will cite as Phoenix's crown jewel. The emotion within the film supersedes great acting by taking a step into reality. Arthur Fleck is a character that is written so well and so real that it hurts. Where much of the media stigmatizes mental illness, the character of Arthur Fleck humanizes it.The cinematography in this movie is incredible. 2019 has been a year of great camera work, and this film spearheads the year. There are many iconic scenes layered throughout the film that are phenomenally shot. As the movie progresses, the film grows exceptionally in terms of cinematography. At times it is hard to tell whether the movie was shot digitally or on film. Essentially, this movie bridges the gaps between new wave cinema and contemporary cinema in a graceful manner. The lighting used within the film is atmospheric and successfully matches Arthur's mood throughout the film. The cinematography is masterful.This film is a Dramatic, Psychological Thriller with a great twist. The writing is insanely clever. The suspense is uncanny. The ending is satisfying and chilling. The supporting cast are great. They add weight to Arthur's emotion, successfully building him up and progressing his development. The soundtrack is iconic. The music enhances the overall experience as opposed to watering it down with noise. This film is damn near perfection. Todd Philips and Joaquin Phoenix created a modern masterpieceOverall, Joker is a classic in the making. It challenges the stigma surrounding mental illness, presenting a narrative coupled with classism. This movie is important. In a zeitgeist where mental instability is a common issue, this film gives voice to the voiceless."
993,"I'll leave all the glossy remarks to the paid critics.I simply want to say that seldom have I been so riveted by a performance as I was last night.I'm primarily a comic Fan, long term too. Most adaptions are less than rubbish. This is excellent. Phoenix is Oscar worthy and the production is terrific.Being set in the past removes the over abundance of tech and gadgets which suits the character and the myth. It also allows the actors and the words to shine.The photography, the music (wow) and the supporting cast was flawless.So pleased it's still possible to make a movie like this."
994,"I am not a fan of the dd batman universe, I am never interested, but they recommended the movie and I do not regret those 122 minutes I spent watching this magnificent piece of art. The direction, photography and lighting is brutal and accompanies the progress and development of the plot and the character. Phoenix played the joker spectacularly and magnificently, I loved his performance and I found the best selection. The development of the joker and his thankfulness is incredible, his important moments were well managed and he loved everything about him. Frances conroy great as always. If you did not see it, watch it, even if you are not a fan or have not seen other movies, just watch it, because it is not essential. One of the best movies of the year"
995,"This ain't no ordinary superhero movie. Never have I expected to tear up watching a movie especially in this day and age. The writing and character development is done extremely well, have I ever feel the pain The Joker goes through in this life. How his relation of his surroundings I compare to my relations with leftists elites like Silicon Valley and corrupt governments of western Europe to nihilists who infest the western world. That feel of wanting to change absolutely everything and how satisfying it would feel if you've actually achieve this stance of changing the landscape around you. Albeit my goals are a permanent renaissance, A permanent nirvana for the shreds of sanity of humanity, being the innocent ones, the ones unlike the ignorant normies and the scummy elitists who tear the world apart. Never have I expected a movie made in recent times have I ever felt shocked or uncomfortable in a good way. A movie to really inspire me especially at this magnitude is extremely hard to come across. Like The Matrix, it should really get you to grasp on an extremely interesting perspective of the world. A movie to really challenge you on what you perceive in life. This is one epic masterpiece if I've ever seen one."
996,"This film is far removed from the comic book capers one would initially expect. There is no superhero action sequences here. This is a psychologically thrilling yet disturbingly shocking version of The Joker, maybe a character study if you will.There is no falling into chemical waste in this movie; what you get here isn't a physical destruction of the character but a mental one. This could be a film of The Joker's psyche rather than his story.Phoenix's portrayal is nothing short of amazing. At times I felt like he may have tried too hard, but regardless this is an award winning performance and it's clear that he has thrown everything into this character both mentally and physically.Coupled with a beautiful soundtrack and amazing photography and direction this is a true masterpiece.Personally I'd rate this as the best entrant into the Gotham City universe so far. To follow this going to be insanely difficult.A movie that is, at times, cringeworthy yet still keeps you mesmerised. This is a sickly sweet, brutal and deeply dark and disturbing film. There is no good versus evil here; there is only pure evil. This franchise has finally come of age."
997,"As an avid movie watcher, I can't help but get bothered by the amount of people comparing the jokers from the latest film to the one in Dark Knight. Let me first clear the fact that I think Heath Ledger's performance in the dark knight set the bar extremely high for anyone that was to play the role again, this was clear from the miserable attempt by Jared Leto in suicide squad.The joker in the latest instalment is about how he became the joker and the revelations of his childhood trauma and mental illness, it's the back story to everything you've ever seen about a joker. It is stupidly wrong for anyone to compare him to the Joker from the dark knight, where we see a matured chaotic version, a finished product more or less.This movie was not supposed to tell you a story with a begging middle and end, it doesn't have a very sold narrative nor it's supposed to be a fast paced watch. There's nothing wrong with that and I honestly don't think that's what they were going for. It portrays his existing struggle with his illness, his failed career aspirations and the harshness of the society he's in. The movie is about him and him only, the uprising of the joker everyone knew before this movie.If you're still bothered by the story then let the cinematography and sounds effects sink in for a moment.My final opinion is about the acting, it is one of the most original and convincing roles I've ever seen in a film, every move combined with his body language, tone and that horrific laughter captured my attention, which gave me goosebumpsIf Heath Ledger was alive today, he'd most certainly be proud of Joaquin's acting"
998,"When you're at the beginning of the movie, you think that you've got it all figured out: Arthur's mental illness, Sophie and even his mom, but when you progress through it you start seeing things the other way; you start doubting everything and every theory you had about his life and his motives, was everything you saw really happening or was it just a product of Joker's crazy imagination, was he even there or was he in the Arkham Asylum imagining it all. That's the beauty of this movie - it makes you wonder. That's why I think that Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar and that's why I rated it 10 out of 10. I could go on and on about how perfect and fitting was the music and choreography but let's just leave it at that. If you didn't already, go watch it and have your mind blown!"
999,"One of the best films since the Dark Knight trilogy came out. So incredibly profound that I left the theater appreciating it more and more as I couldn't stop thinking about all the subtleties in the script and acting that made it perfect. I've never seen another movie like it. Going to see it again soon and will buy the blu-Ray when it's released. I had high expectations and it exceeded them. Do not listen to the critics and do not think ""it's just hype"" go see it for your self and see how incredible this masterpiece truly is."
1000,"The system hates this movie because it's too close to reality, see the disconnect between the critics views & the paying public, this is exactly why people voted for Trump & for Brexit & why this movie is so dangerous because it suggests a sense of empowerment & a pulling down of the established order."
1001,This movie is a really art work! It's amazing! The best of 2019! Joaquin Phoenix always will be live in our hearts
1002,"Tonight, I went to see the movie Joker about the origins of Batman nemesis, as you may have noticed by reading my other entries in this diary, I had extremely high expectations for this film. With so many expectations, I thought it would be difficult for this work to touch me or surprise me. Yet coming out of the cinema I was completely dazzled, by what seems to me to be the best film of the decade. This film deals well with the psychology of the character, he approaches the character as never before, the end and the revelations that are made to me took my breath away. Finally, I hope that Joaquin Phoenix, the actor who plays the Joker probably achieved the performance of his life even outperforming his own interpretation of Commodus in the Gladiator film. In Todd Phillips' film Joker, he presented a performance that pays tribute to the great names in film. I am confident that his role will be honored at the Oscars and other major awards ceremonies."
1003,"This was just brilliant! It's been a long time since I enjoyed a DC film. Got no words, Joaquin deserves an Oscar for his performance as the Joker."
1004,Did the Critics watch the same movie as everyone else?
1005,Thats the first time in my life i made an account here just so i can rate this movie 10/10
1006,I made an account because of this movie. I loved every second of it. This is the best actor to ever grace DC I almost find it impossible to believe they'll keep the quality up after this movie. I laugh at the controversies surrounding this by people with no clue as to what mental illness is or lack the capacity to know the spectrum it covers. See this movie. You will walk away having been impacted by one thing or the other.
1007,"You don't get to see this type of movie very often in theaters nowadays. And seeing almost 2,000 reviews two days after the movie had landed seems to support that opinion. What's the hype really about?Here you have a tough movie detailing the life of a mentally unstable person living in a collapsing society. Does that seem like a movie which can create buzz? That looks, at least to me, like a movie made for narrower audience. But once you combine this setting with the Joker persona, you have something extraordinary with capacity to start debate and controversy. And we can ask ourselves why is that? Is it only because this movie hit cinemas at the right time detailing delicate themes of modern era? Or is there something peculiar in combining Joker and prevailing illness and loneliness?Many people have already rightly pointed out similarities between Joker and Scorsese's Taxi Driver. In both cases we are following stories of mentally sick man surrounded by awful conditions. Manner in which the topic is dealt with is similar as well: very graphic and open. But here similarities stop. These are two very different movies having totally different objectives.First, Taxi Driver elaborates on a guy having some sort of superiority complex and problematic, if not even sick, approach to women (madonna-wh**e complex from Freudian psychology). Joker gives us insight into a person who has been bullied, underestimated and made use off his entire life. Plus, everybody knows who Joker really is. He's crazy, enigmatic, smart and influential.This knowledge takes us additionally into entirely different direction since in Taxi Driver we couldn't really tell with high confidence what's going to happen with Travis. That's the brilliance of Taxi Driver. It tricks you and makes you guess since Travis seems to think and act pretty sound but still showing signs of deteriorating mind. Brilliance of Joker is that the guy who is to become Joker, *undoubtedly* mentally unstable and violent, doesn't trick us like Travis but makes us sympathize showing his side of the story.Joker is thus more than a story about an underdog. I'd say, contrary to popular opinion, that Joker is more a social commentary than a character study. For a movie to be a character study we'd have to see more description of characters inner dynamics (Travis writing his diaries in Taxi Driver). Besides, Joker is who he is because he is socially very relevant. He's got followers and has become an idea. What we're really witnessing is *not* underdog becoming a winner but society collapsing and loosing its way. Joker is a winner only because society became a loser.So there's really nothing to admire about Joker. I personally look at him as a sign of what might happen to a society of individuals in which:""Everybody yells and screams to each other. Nobody is civil anymore. Nobody thinks what it's like to be the other guy. ""And that is why I see this movie as a great social commentary, especially during times in which entire world has been struck by tragedies, horrors and mutual distrust."
1008,Best movie in 2019.Just watch it...really awesome..
1009,"In my opinion this movie should be the example for future films, because it proved that good movies can be created without cgi. This movie contains a profound character, and plot. Furthermore, Joaquin Phoenix's play is exceptional, and his devotion for this role can not be ignored. I can recommend it to those, who want to know the origin of Joker."
1010,"It's a masterpiece. Simple as that. Joaquin does the role of his life in this movie. It felt so real, Arthur really is a troubled man and boy did we get the perfect man to play him. The writing and directing is also amazing, Todd Phillips really makes you feel the Scorsese-Taxi Driver vibes. It's so dark and it makes you sympathize with Arthur when you really shouldn't in a way.I am going to watch it again, for sure. Easily one of my favorite movies of all time. This will be a classic."
1011,"When I sat to watch the Joker , I was anxious because as a person I do not like comic book movies . It's just my taste . I really don't find those movies so important because most of the times , they do not transmit a message . However , my opinion changed when I viewed the Joker . Personally , I do not think that this movie is a comic book one . It is a drama that shows the tragic life of an ordinary individual , who is disregarded by the society around him . From a specific point of view , you feel sorry for him and you really want to blame the rich and powerful who have created a societal trap that helps them achieve their personal goals while ordinary people suffer every day . From another perspective however , you are scared and terrified by his reaction to all this misery that society brings to him . That's what this movie perfectly does . It creates a story that is split in two subjective realities . The distorted reality of Arthur Fleck that is influenced greatly by his mental illness and the reality through the eyes of the common people that blame his actions . It is a story that depends on how the viewer wants to see it . But I think that the story really shows the life of a man who did the wrong things and reacted in a psychopathic way to his problems , partly because of his mental illness and partly because of the pressure that was created by the environment around him . It is a story that does not justify this guy , but also does not accuse him . It just shows us that we , as a whole , sometimes create a Joker , without often realising it . So , for me it is a presentation of the two sides of the same story , those of an unstable and poor individual in a cruel dystopian city that does not care for people like him and those of the people with common sense . Additionally , it wants to tell people that they should take care of men and women who have mental problems and they should fight for a better world that does not treat the unprivileged so harshly as it does ."
1012,Best of overall movie. I very don't know what to say but you really need to see this movie.
1013,"The movie starts with this anorexic dude sprinting pretty fast, idk it was at least like 60mph. I mean this guy looks like his skeleton is trying to escape his body, and the whole movie is him trying to prove he's the fastest clown on the planet. Then in the end he explodes, I think the talk show guy said he wasn't that fast, which is bull."
1014,"I'm not sure why it was such good ratings. There was a lot of pointless things in the movie like Bruce Wayne is his step brother but not really. It was way to slow. He is crazy because he was abused as a child and his mother is crazy, that's pretty much the whole story"
1015,"So I really didn't enjoy the Joker movie and definitely can understand the people being upset. In my opinion it sucks people in thinking they'll see a comic book type movie, just as a marketing ploy and then leans heavily on trying to randomly include source material via namedropping ""Wayne"" . Then it's similar to the Movie Taxi Driver (made with Denerio) about a guy that goes crazy and kills people and is then celebrated for it and glorifies violence as ""deserving it and embraced by people who understand and condone murder"" not even entertaining in that just wallowes in self pity and shifting of blame for actions. If you want to make a movie like that, it can be done and done well obviously since it's taken from another movie. But don't try and use connections to comic books to increase the crowd draw and then expect people to be ok with it. Saying its societies fault when someone who deserves to be institutionalized and would be in real life and that society condones murder and it's not the killers fault is tone deaf in this day and age. Plots progression is unbelievable acting is great for sure."
1016,"GO WATCH JOKER RN,Hounestly the best performance in a movie tied with Marlon Brando in godfather and heath ledger in dark knight, never have I seen such a well made comic book movie since dark knight, joker was amazing and it proves that comic book movies can be masterpieces too"
1017,I walked out I was so bored. I watch most films this I just didn't get. It made me feel uncomfortable.
1018,"Joaquin Phoenix' performance: ARest of the movie as a whole: DTotal: CSome will love it, some will hate it. I'm somewhere in the middle."
1019,"I wonder about the people who says""it's a good movie""?? (Not about performance). I guess some kind of advertising agency may played role to make this movie hit and few people who thinks themselves they are more intellectual (really may not) follow it. I never seen such a bad movie having no entertainment, no moral.. Moreover, I feel it's conveying dangerous message (cruel,kindless as hero) which may misleading immatured people(should be 18+)"
1020,The BEST.Absolute masterpiece. Every award ceremony should recognize this film and Pheonix You are GOD.
1021,I can't believe this movie made so much money and has such great reviews. This thing is absolutely horrible and boring all of the way through it. Heath Ledger is still the king when it comes to playing the joker. Phoenix was descent but nowhere near as good. I just hope they don't make another one.
1022,"Oscar bait with a try-hard message that is obvious at any point. The acting is good but nowhere near perfection. The camera work is good but shows nothing new, the same goes to everything else.
It's ok at best so I'd give it a 4-5 but since everyone treats it as a masterpiece, so will I. Compared to Pulp Fiction, Eraserhead, The Audition, Dances with Wolves, Lone Wolf and Cub, The Dark Knight, Alien etc it's a shaky 2 at best...sorry
If you break it down it's a crazy guy dancing and making funny faces while the message is slapping you in the face.
Nothing artsy about this piece of mainstream cinema."
1023,"This movie is quite simply perfect. An emotional roller coaster which at times has you cheering for the villain, out of sympathy for his plight. Phoenix is sublime, but one must wonder what type of personality is required to play this particular role to such perfection. Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, Joaquin Phoenix all interpreted the role with immense effect. What did the Joker do to them, psychologically? What is the impact of immersing oneself so deeply in a role like this?"
1024,"Joaquin Phoenix, maybe the best living actor today, what a performance."
1025,"I avoided this film for some time due to an aversion to violence (thinking more about needless comic book violence) but today, with a storm blowing hard outside, I watched it.
Not at all what I expected and certainly not always easy to look at (and not due to the scenery or lighting which were both very skilled).
Others may describe the excellent technicalities of the film but I'd like to add a more sociological aspect. We, society, never learn do we? It goes round and round; in this case class warfare, deliberately ignorant government, mockery of those who suffer and the self-righteousness of the elite.
Well Joker shows us the consequences and as history holds it is always a form of revolution, in this case violence and mayhem in the streets of Gotham.
How reflective of today's world.
Not to be watched for light entertainment, this is a serious movie."
1026,"Watching this movie is an experience. A breathtaking, horrible, dark, depressing, powerful experience.It's a classic in my books."
1027,Omg one of the best dc films out there blew my breath away. The performance of all the characters were outstanding and I love the twist and turns
1028,This movie is absolutely amazing. Joaquin Phoenix did one of the greatest performances in the cinema's history.
1029,The acting was amazing!! He could not have done ANY better with the script he had. Acting 10/Script 8.5 Phoenix has become an acting legend with this movie.
1030,"One of the greatest movies ever made in my opinion, but not a movie everyone would understand. The layers may be too deep and inaccessible for some people. From my point of view: Great acting, fantastic production, a nerve-wracking story, morbid humor and the score is out of this world."
1031,"Here's a rhetoric question - does Joaquin deserves an Oscar for this role!?To be honest, I actually don't care who else is running for the best actor in leading role, i was ready to give him Oscar after watching this movie for just 30min."
1032,"This movie gave an insight to the picture of mental illness and how consuming it is. If people want to say this movie is ""dark"" it's the picture of that real disease. For me this movie was a true pleasure, Joaquin absolutely poured all of his talent into his role. His portrayal brought to light the real reason The Joker became such the character. His performance alone made this a must see if you are a fan of Batman."
1033,"I will start off by saying this review will be spoiler free, as well as a minor disclaimer for those thinking about seeing Todd Phillip's Joker.If you are expecting your typical, over-done, run of the mill comic book movie. You won't find that here. This is not a film filled with jokes that either work or don't work; this isn't a movie where the heroes always win. This is a movie centered around a troubled man and his descent into madness.It is dark and, at times, horrifying. And it is an outstanding masterpiece because of that. Had this movie been toned down, it would not have been nearly as great as it is.Joker is centered around a failed, mentally-troubled comedian called Arthur Fleck. He is constantly looked down upon by society, beaten and bullied. And, as you may have guessed, this causes him to slowly lose his mind and become the Joker. That's not a spoiler, by the way. If you think that's a spoiler, look at the name and synopsis of the movie.It's filled with shocking, gruesome scenes. Tense encounters. A realistic depiction of how it is to lose sanity. And it is absolutely terrifying. A once innocent man trying to chase his dream like so many of us is beaten and bullied, or often ignored by society when it matters, becomes ones of the most notorious criminals in all of comic book history.Joaquin Phoenix delivers an Oscar-Worthy performance that rivals that of Heath Ledger. And at times? It trumps Heath Ledger's Joker. It is crazy and sadistic and, at times, honestly haunting. Terrifying, even. The writing is absolutely incredible in this movie and complements Joaquin's acting abilities. I don't think there could have been anyone better to star in this movie than him.Acting his fantastic across the board. But this review would be incredibly long if I wrote as much about them as I have Phoenix. But everyone, from top to bottom, contributed to this masterpiece extremely well.If you've not seen it already, go see it! Just do not expect this to be like anything else you have seen. It's dark, twisted and haunting. It's not a happy-go-lucky, joke filled superhero flick.10/10"
1034,"This dark film was something that I knew I'd see but maybe I'd wait til streaming release but without something to do on Halloween I took myself to movies.I did not read any reviews but as I sat in cinema watching every last credit scroll up the only word that seemed fitting was Masterpiece. It seems that's a word common to describe this.The frail and yet emotionally powerful physicality of Phoenix captivates and unsettles throughout.The clever weaving of different characters' storylines in this origin tale makes complete sense and nothing feels contrived. Whether or not (perhaps especially if you are not) a fan of superhero blockbusters this film should draw you in and haunt you.Much food for thought on how society deals with difference,...not paying lip service to it..the innocence of Frankenstein, grotesque and wanting love and acceptance in a cruel world definitely echoes in this universal story.I recommend to anyone who likes to be moved not just entertained.."
1035,One the best movie of all-time . Master performance by Jouaquin Phoenix . Powerfully directed movie .
1036,"Joaquin Phoenix definitely deserves Oscar for his acting in this film. His expressions, his laugh and his dance is what gives u thrills and goosebumps. This movie was a masterpiece and Phoenix is incredible."
1037,"Joaquins performance, what can you say? Oscar worthy.Incredible movie, the one we deserved."
1038,"The joker film by Todd Phillips, is a great depiction of the famed DC villain. It added a twist unlike any joker film ever scene. The take on the character and the astonishing performance by Joaquin Phoenix, gave us a joker that we have wanted since Heath ledger. I really hope DC can develop a story that keeps the characters going in a series that we will enjoy!"
1039,"My immediate reaction coming out of the cinema was that the film would be better suited as a play. This being because in the film there are only really four main settings: the apartment, the city, the subway, and the comedy club/theatre/television studio. Especially with the last setting(s) I mentioned, as a play the various reactions of a live audience could add realism and also an active reciprocal interaction between Arthur and an audience which I think would be more entertaining.I agree with my friend's opinion of the film, for which he believed the range of issues covered was ""as wide as a sea but as deep as a pond"". The main issues such as mental health, misogyny, class, politics, and parental relations (as well as many others) were all raised and recognised as issues but were not explored in any depth, again as my friend put beautifully he believed Phillips was ""tickboxing"" issues that are meaningful to current audiences.When Arthur is sitting alone at the back of the bus, the CGI outside the back window is horrendous. There is also a weird camera shake when Arthur climbs into the fridge, which from the angle makes you think this is from a first-person perspective of an unknown person in Arthur's flat, but then there is a cut and on reflection seems bizarre. Clearly Phillips ran out of budget and had to film on a potato.The musical score was excellent until it was muddled with contemporary music (for example when Arthur dances down the concrete steps) which was a jarring and incongruent.On a more positive note, Phoenix's Joker was original and superbly acted. Arthur having a condition making him laugh creepily and inappropriately was an authentic and believable aspect of his character. Phoenix is very effective at laughing with dead and soulless eyes, making him seem utterly sinister.Similar to Hamlet, The Joker can be played in many different ways because of the ambiguous complexity of his character. Phoenix's Joker is a victim of the worst aspects of society, fragile, and deeply forlorn. This being a very different interpretation to the assertive and more dominant representations in Leto's or Ledger's performances.All in all, a good watch but please someone adapt it into a play!PS: I want that suit."
1040,"Just seen Joker.
What can i say....I loved every second of this beautiful and depressing movie. Yes it's Phoenix from beginning til the end, but he playes Joker so convincingly, you could only feel for him, care for him and love him.
(And no, i am not mentally ill)The entire movie is exceptionally well made, the story, the setting, the music and yes... Joaquin's portrayal of the joker is undoubtedly the most disturbing, I've ever seen.Do not compare with Nicholson or Ledger (still favorite) just watch and let this Joker do the laughing.No joke, the Oscar goes to....."
1041,Probably one of the best movies I have ever seen in a while. The one flaw it has was probably that it could of made the lines of what was a dream the whole time and what was reality smoother.
1042,"Masterpiece? No.
Great? No.
Good? Barely.Sure the acting was good, but it was overshadowed by the drudgery. I kept saying to myself, ""get to the point"". Does the director think I'm stupid? I get it, he is insane. But they forgot that not only is the Joker insane, he is freaking brilliant.How can it be a masterpiece if the movie misses the centerpiece??Finally, the movie is way too long and plods along so slowly repeating the same note without creating a symphony.Hopefully the fan edit will dwindle this down to it's essence while providing some depth. At almost 2 hours, the movie creates an atmosphere of overindulgence of self-aggrandizing without substance.One last point, the the sheer amount of 10 rated reviews prior to this movie's release is indicative of the shenanigans of the movie industry and reflective of American business. Just shameful."
1043,"Everything that has to be praised has. Joaquin's performance and psychological angle. But, the media seems to think the message of the movie is to spread violence and chaos. It's not, the message is to show kindness and compassion to others because you're negative actions could create a new joker."
1044,"This is one of those once in a lifetime movies that will make you move uncomfortably in your seat. You want to chear for him, you understand how he got to where he is, but your logic and morals don't let you connect. Truly a masterpiece, and fantastic acting. Life is cruel, people are cruel, and this movie slaps you in the face with it."
1045,"I personally loved the movie, you have to go in with an open mind. I agree that you can't compare Heath's Joker to Joaquin's. They're both unique and spectacular in their own way"
1046,"Joker is a film about a man's transformation from the mentally ill loner Arthur Fleck to the widely-known villain Joker. This seems straightforward enough, but there are much deeper messages in this movie that apply not just to this fictional universe, but to our real world.
Arthur is a man who has been beaten down by not just society but fate itself time and time again. He has been dealt, for lack of a better term, a s*** hand and no one in his life seems to truly want to help him. He is a man that truly is alone in society, learning throughout the film how true that statement really is.
While the actions committed by him are definitely wrong, we understand him and can even somewhat empathize with him (hopefully we can, I may just be weird). Unlike how some people like to suggest, this movie doesn't glorify the violence that Arthur causes. This movie shows how horrible people can be created by the environment they are living in. We are living in a time where we like to blame the violence around us on the insane people who start it. Shootings are happening more than ever, and the insane gunman is responsible for it.
Of course, it cannot be denied that the gunman is at fault. There is clearly something wrong with the people who do these things. However, much too few people think, ""Why is this happening?"", ""Why are these people doing the things they do, and how can we stop them from doing this?"" We see the result of what happens when an at risk individual doesn't get the help he needs in this movie. What we need is a system that can actually help these people.
The movie Joker differs from other comic book movies because it is not only grounded in reality, but it's messages can be directly applied to our world. People like Arthur Fleck, people who have been brutally beaten by life at every turn need a way to be helped. The rich and successful don't care about these people. These people are viewed as threats instead of who they really are: humans, just like everyone else. We need to create an outlet where these individuals can get the actual support they need, not stuff them with medication and let specialists with their own agendas pretend to care about them.
Another argument I've seen about this movie is that it has no reason for existing. It shows violence and shows a unique portrayal of a popular character but it has no substance to it. As you can probably tell, I strongly disagree with anyone who believes this, and I truly believe anyone who thinks this completely missed the point of the entire movie.
In conclusion, this movie definitely has substance and doesn't glorify violence in the slightest. This movie brings up an issue in our society that we have been neglecting for far too long. There's a stigma about mentally ill people that we have to get over. People who have been neglected and have nothing left to lose are the most dangerous type of people, and the problem with our society is that we allow people to feel as if they have nothing left to lose. Arthur Fleck is just a person who never got any sign at all that he was needed or loved by society, or anyone for that matter. He is truly, as cliche as this may sound, a product of his environment. You can criticize this movie for being too dark but by doing so you're just dismissing the reality we live in."
1047,"Amazing Acting , plot , directing everything is perfect .
one of the best joker origin movie"
1048,"The depth to which Joaquin Pheonix plays Joker is actually disturbing. This Joker is so very different than the gold standard Heath Ledger. In Heath's Joker, we feel unpredictable and scared or terrified, but Joaquin potrays a Joker which isn't as terrifying but it's downright eerie, disturbing and unnerving. It makes you sympathize with Joker, the most despicable character in comic universe, and makes you wanna help him. It doesn't make you justify Joker's choices but it will make you understand them, and by the end you will want to justify Arthur's actions, not Joker's but Arthur's. You wouldn't be able to justify them but you will have a hard time to condemn them. Also the story leaves you at an uncertain point open to any interpretation, just like the charachter and the comics it has drew inspiration from. It is a mind boggling, thorough, disturbing and unnerving charachter study that makes you question not only society but yourself too."
1049,"This movie is a masterpiece! It absolutely epitomizes what a DC movie should be. Dark, emotional, thought provoking, not just some mindless over the top action. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Joaquin Phoenix is surely grabbing an Oscar for this one! What a performance, what a movie."
1050,"Love how Phoenix express himself as Joker, absolutely will watch this movie again."
1051,"Watching this film was fantastic, you were so immersed in it and everything that happend had some real impact, to some even, relatable problems. The music was fantastic, the atmosphere was good and the way Arthur tries to be positive and find solace and happiness, everything is only made worse by lies, no help, no friends no nothing.The reason for why for me it is a 10/10 is because i've been in a similar situation before, no friends, don't know how to get help or what to do. Sometimes these simple problems cause the worst of epidemics, ex: violence, mass shootings, suicides and so on.This movie is pretty much a fantastic depiction of mental illness and ""society"".
Watch it, it'll open your eyes to alot of things and topics you've never been able to grasp in its entirety."
1052,"Dazzling performance, every moment shown can be happening to so many of us. Nerve breaking acting. This movie will remain one of my favorite for ever. Everyone needs some importance in life. Thank you for making it so real."
1053,The film is very beautiful. I think I will not watch a movie of this level in the next five years
1054,"If you enjoyed Taxi Driver then go see this film. Simple as that. Don't listen to anyone else about how dark or violent it is because everyone has a had a dark time in their life that they tried to be ""happy"" through."
1055,JP is so good that it hurts watching this stellar Performance. I grew up reading DC and Batman in particular... this movie leaves me speechless and this Joker Origin is just perfect. I will cry myself to sleep tonight...
1056,"I have no words really? I went to the cinema to see it for the second time today, it's even better now. I mean honestly, how can a person nail such an iconic role that good? Joaquin Phoenix plays the Joker the we have always wanted. Don't get me wrong, Heath Ledger's acting will never be forgotten. BUT OH MY GOD!
Joaquin's performance is breathtaking! There's a little bit of everything in there. But one of the things that I love the most about his acting in this movie, is how he succeeds showing multiple feelings at once. You can see Arthur's sadness while he's laughing. YOU feel his broken heart.
The directors of this movie show you the life of a schizophrenic, lonely and a psychotic person. I think we all don't really know who's side were on, who are the good guys and who are the bad guys?"
1057,"I would like to start this review by pointing out the fact that everything in this movie is just amazing, from the cast & crew members to the acting and to the story itself. Many people believed that this would just be another Marvel-like movie, but it was nothing like that. Todd did an excellent job in telling this character's story in such a unique way that it makes you want more. The way that he told the story of this worldwide known character is something amazing. The cinematography itself was simply astonishing. Troughout the movie there were some amazing shots that just took your breath away.
Joaquin's acting in this picture was just out of this world. The way that he portraied Joker's character was something to learn from. He put his whole heart in this particular role and you could easily see it while watching the movie. He made you fall in love with the character, although he is a villain. Even the dancing scenes took my breath away as he did such an amazing job in this area too. He truly deserves an Oscar for this outstanding performance.
I truly believe that this is one of the best character studies there ever were. It is one of those movies that make you want to see it again and again without getting bored of it. It makes you want more. Todd made such a good job by bringing awareness to mental health issues
to the world and although this movie has its range of bad reviews, it still makes you understand how the society truly works these days.
To conclude, this is and exceptional movie and i totally recommend it with all my heart. You will not regret it!"
1058,"I am reluctant to see ""superhero"" movies. I this case, I would see it again and again. Joaquin Phoenix is just an Oscar winner actor."
1059,"A well crafted film with a more realistic approach on the comic book villain joker. The movie takes everyone to the 80's environment with the amazing cinematography, costumes and set design. Joaquin Phoenix is the only actor who could perform this iteration of Joker to the perfection. The movie is great and will be a cult film because it took a realistic approach by showcasing who Arthur Fleck is, and what makes him to be the joker. There aren't many action scene which is a great choice and in the few fight scenes which the movie has depicts how vulnerable is Arthur. The Nolan's Trilogy was a huge success and loved among the fans till date because it had a similar approach by making a batman film in a more realistic and a believable tone by making him more vulnerable to punches, guns, knives, dogs[;)] instead of making him more pumped up with too many gadgets, armor and fighting against the unbelievably strong godlike villains with his infinite stamina, health and never ending supply of his gadgets. The more grounded approach made the audience feel connected with Nolan's Trilogy. This film also follows in those footsteps and had achieved it perfectly. Todd Phillips with his direction and Joaquin Phoenix with his acting, together they have crafted a masterpiece."
1060,"Where to begin. An essential story that had to be told. Not because its the Joker. Not because its DC or Batman related. Because it is current.What is more important for film than to lure with one illusion, only to present something unexpected yet essential. The Joker does this effortlessly. Even if the Joker wasn't a well known character this production would have worked. The movie presents a picture for something very prevalent in global western society today; the disintegration of societal values, structure, and security and its human impact on the less privileged in society.Arthur is the ultimate anti-hero and through his journey emerges as perhaps a more powerful hero than his arch nemesis to be. A David v Goliath type story. A hero is after all someone who stands up for the weak, injustice and those who cant stand up for themselves; Arthur has these traits, though not in a conventional sense. The weak in his story is him; what greater hero than someone who stands up for themselves and emerges triumpant ? My statement will of course have many people screaming given Arthur's chosen methods. What underlies it all is a person fighting back the only way they know how, once they've been pushed too far; at the story's core, Arthur is simply screaming for ""help"".What about mental health you shout? He is totally messed up and off his meds. Of course, because mental health is just something that is the cause not the result? Mental health is correlated to societal values, function and security. Arthur's mental health is the result of his environment, so we are all to blame for Arthur's situation."
1061,"People are already familiar with superhero movie genres (like MCU) - state-of-the-art special effects, top-notch action, eye-catching action, clear good and evil, usually divided into two lines of good and bad characters fight with each other. Joker appears as a new breeze, the film with dark colors, heavy psychology, multiple meanings. The film also has a villain, but it seems that besides Joker, all the remaining characters are villains, he alone with his desire, with his soul and body have been trampled to the extreme against whole ""world"". The majority of moviegoers are young people, including those who once loved the Joker of The Dark Knight. The Joker in TDK is much more crazy from thinking to acting out through action. He lives for his IDEAL, making Harley Quinn crazy with him. Joaquin's Joker is also crazy but crazy in a more life-like manner, with more psychological changes, making the audience think more. And so among the heads who have seen Endgame, there are some who have not felt the Joker, have not been familiar with such a heavy psychological drama after days of watching and waiting for the super products blockbusters, romance movies, live - action movies and horror movies. And although I disagree with Martin Scorsese's opinion that ""Marvel movies are not movies"", I understand he has his reasons for saying so. Please review Joker a few more times to feel the full meaning of the movie, I myself could not understand all the messages that the film sent, so I will definitely have to watch it again. I am waiting for analyzing and explaining the cut scenes in Vietnam. But please don't say that Joker is ""bored"", ""sleepy"", ""not as good as Joker in TDK"", ... something like that. Because it's not natural that Joker is so appreciated. 😉"
1062,"Ive been lucky to live and witness both Heath's and Joaquin's performance and till now the feeling is still surreal.It started with a slow pace, detail by detail describing how Joker became. Story telling was superb as it covered every aspect of the film. In short every question was answered from the start till the finish.I tell you this movie is not made for all. It is very dark and it will leave a mark on you when you finished it watching. An instant classic for me!"
1063,Joker is a disturbing look through the eyes and soul of a sad man who blames the world for his insanity. An emotional adventure that attach you in the chair all movie. Masterpiece of the decade and the performance of a lifetime by Joaquin Phoenix.
1064,"Movie of the decade...
Phoenix nailed it....
Dark and greedy ....
Wanna watch again and again..."
1065,"I don't often write reviews for movies, but this film is just incredible. Joaquin plays the role better than anyone ever has, or ever could. You really do put yourself in Joker's shoes, feeling so many different emotions throughout. Joker exceeded my expectations in ways I didn't think possible. 10/10 performance!"
1066,Very graphic and disturbing but you won't lose focus for a second. Astonishing performance by Phoenix.
1067,Best Movie I have ever seen in my whole life and I hope to get 4 OSCAR to the Joker movie.
1068,"The Joker is basically a film about a man dealing with severe mental illness. You will watch him go about his daily life struggling to cope and deal with the world around him. You will see how his illness affects him, it's quite unsettling.The Joker is dark and depressing throughout. It's an Oscar winning performance by Joaquin phoenix.This film is about the Joker before he becomes the Joker. It's his struggle with mental illness while he is trying to find his place in the world and become the comic book character that takes on Gotham City. I don't think most people quite realise this before they go to see it."
1069,"Love it, not a waste of time at all. Love the story, the acting,... everything is great and i CANT LET MY EYES OUT OF IT."
1070,"The story is fast paced and the cinematography looked great. No unnatural dialogue, no fabricated bland romance - just awesome acting and a fascinating story."
1071,"Well done, very well acted, good direction, good soundtrack, all in this movie works and its very interesting. Bravooooooo"
1072,"This is one of the best thing I've ever saw in my life, I went to the theater for 6 times to saw this movie .
Joaquin Phoenix Is THE BEST JOKER EVER!
Take the Oscar NOW"
1073,"I'm not a fan of DC in fact I Watched most of marvel's movies (Marvel fan) But this Movie is different, The building of Joker's character was magnificent their was alot of references for Batman I think U shouldn't watch the Joker if you didn't watch batman Dark Knight Trilogy or if u not familiar with batman/Bruce wane Story.
This Movie was one of the best movies I've ever seen."
1074,"Amazing movie ! , the actor performance , the story , the music , everything!"
1075,Heath Ledger would be in awe. Get to the cinema now. Like nothing I have ever seen. Pheniox has turned on a performance of a decade.
1076,"After 11 years, the legacy has been revived. Heath would be proud!"
1077,"I'm in awe.. Absolute awe. I just have no words. Joaquin Phoenix was born to play the Joker. The cinematography, soundtrack, acting, sets.. Everything was just pure cinema brilliance.This movie is truly worthy of a sequel and it would be an absolute shame if Phoenix never played the part again."
1078,"Truly a masterpiece of filmmaking. I would without a doubt argue that Joaquin Phoenix holds one of the best performances of all time, this may even be the best performance I've ever witnessed in cinema. Truly truly a masterwork. People say it's violent but the world is violent, just most people who can afford to go to the movies are lucky enough that their bubble keeps the darker parts of the world out, but how long can we stay at such peace? Is the peace we hold real in the grand scheme of things? Or are we just fooling ourselves?"
1079,"Since 20 years am alive on this planet but to be true I have never seen any movie like this. This is a type of movie which comes once in every 50 years, it's a pure art depiction of how a mentally ill person lives and finds it's true self. For those who don't know this movie is not taken from the comics nor it is related to the Justice League universe. This is a fresh take on the Joker character."
1080,"I have just returned home from watching the Joker without reading any reviews or listening to comments prior too, what I have watched tonight is a cinematic triumph, I could go on to use all the usual clichés but I won't, I actually commented to my wife as we drove home claiming we have just watched a modern day classic, a film so well crafted visually that it is actually faultless, from style to gritty disturbing focuses on character creation to beautiful cinematography that leaves you both moved and uncomfortable but so glad you watched it in opening week. This film will be the topic of many a discussion for years to come Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerising and equally the most disturbed Joker I have watched. Hoorah at last for something that's truly changed my opinion on modern film choices. But a huge congrats to those brave enough to endeavour in rebelling in film making in a world gone politically mad."
1081,"I must admit I was hesitant to see Joker on my own. I didn't know how I'd react to it knowing the film has sensitive material about mental illness. I braved it out anyway; I left the cinema shook!The film was a raw and honest depiction of what a person with mental illness goes through. The line that hit home is one written in Arthur's journal: ""The worst part of having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don't.""The film shows how society do not provide the resources for people with mental illnesses which make them turn into baddies. In reality, most would rather turn against themselves than to others. The film almost comments on how society fails to nurture people with mental illnesses.Suffering from depression myself, I understand what Arthur is going through. That does not make his actions justified though. He is no hero; he is a confused man denied the care he badly needs.I am lucky compared to Arthur, fortunate than most for getting the treatment I needed. I always had the support of friends, colleagues and family. Arthur isn't that fortunate which led him to spiral down to a bloody life of crime.Joker is a brilliant film you would want to see from start to finish. Credit both for a superb acting from Joaquin Phoenix and a genuine and powerful story!"
1082,"Cinematography was top notch, personally i love the tones on every scenes, the details, the camera movement, the backdrops, mostly everything visual about this movie, i love.Joaquin Phoenix did an amazing job performing his role, that's for sure. But comparing it with Heath's Joker, was unacceptable. Both did amazingly great job, both presented the role best on its own way, there's no way to decide which one is larger.Overall, i agree that this movie is not for everyone. And i personally, enjoy this movie truly as an art. True arts can be both sad and happy, ugly and beautiful, understood and confusing, love and hate, all those mix feelings at the same time.So, how do you take your arts, it's totally up to you. Cheers."
1083,Such a great dark film. As a fan of villains and hater of super hero unrealistic films. I loved this film so much. Acting all Oscar performances. Script dialogue unbelievable. Ending was amazing. Open to interpretation which sometimes doesn't work but here it works beautifully. Going down in my top three films of all time. No flaws here honestly. Also a plus I saw this film in the drake and josh theater in Goleta California. Just an amazing dark film.
1084,"I mean what the hell...
This is definitely the most amazing movie ever made about a comicbook supervillain.
The character development, the turning points, everything is just freaking amazing about this movie.
That ending, joker dancing on car's hood, putting that smile with his blood on his face. Goosebumps...
And don't get me started on Phoenix's performance.
Phoenix definitely deserves an oscar for his performance in this movie.
The best 2019 movie so far..."
1085,"This movie was just absolutely stunning. I would recommend this movie to about anyone. Regardless of controversy, this movie is as good as it gets!"
1086,"I was so excited for this movie ever since it was announced. And today I finally watched it. I travelled around 100 kms just to watch this movie. Because I just don't want to miss this one. And ofcourse I loved the movie. It's once in a lifetime movie. It is Dark, disturbing, intense. Yet undeniably a masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix without any doubt is a real gem of the cinema. This one is not for people who like typical commercial movies and who don't like dark, intense and violent theme.
Robert de Niro's role was short but he did a great job as expected. The movie keeps getting dark. I loved the pace, direction & cinematography. And the BGM is just fantabulous. From the moment when he puts a smile on his face with blood shows that Arthur Fleck is dead now and The Clown Prince of Crime is born. From that moment, He is no longer just a shadow, he's the light of those people to stand up against the oppressors of Gotham. Truly, I feel so overwhelmed by watching this movie. Loved it."
1087,I just love the way he acts the way he cries he is better than any joker
1088,"Review:
'Joker' is an American psychological-thriller film directed by Todd Phillips. Being one of my most anticipated movies of the year as well as a movie I never wanted to be made, I was feeling so many different emotions on my way to the theatre to see this film. I needed time to think about it and process what I had just seen because the movie is very dark and heavy, and after doing so I believe this is my favorite film to come out of 2019.
The movie follows the character of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) who is working as a clown-for-hire while living with and caring for his mother, Penny (Frances Conroy) in Gotham City. We see Arthur get beaten down by society both literally and figuratively, from being jumped in an alley to being fired from his job and being called crazy and useless. Slowly over time, he starts thinking his life is a comedy and transforms into the clown he has been portraying for years.
If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't at least get an Oscar nomination for his portrayal in this movie I will be both surprised and disappointed. What he did to prepare for this role was incredible and he brought everything to every scene he was in. Everybody in this movie fit their roles perfectly, but other than Joaquin Phoenix another standout performance for me has to be Robert De Niro. He wasn't in the film a whole lot, but I really believed he could have been a Talk-Show Host. He didn't phone it in at all and really committed which I appreciated.
I really can't talk about what I liked in this movie without going into spoiler territory. However, I will say that the movie needed to be Rated-R and I'm so happy Todd Phillips pushed the Studio into letting that happen. There were certain scenes that I could tell if they tried to do the same thing in a PG-13 film, it wouldn't have worked. They were also very smart in showing Arthur slowly progress into the Joker we know and it didn't just all happen at once, he hated his life in the beginning and dragged his feet when he walked, and by the end he is carrying himself with confidence.
Overall, I really can't say a lot about this movie beside I loved it! I beg for everybody to go and see this movie in theatres, movies like this deserve to make money so original films like this can be made. Yes, even though this is based off a 'Batman' character, it is still a very original story and I highly recommend.
5/5"
1089,"I've just got back from the cinema and I'm still in complete shock how incredible this film is. The acting from Joaquin moved me in parts and felt uncomfortable but incredibly gripping at the same time, just amazing. I've never felt this way from any of the previous related films, but this one is very different. You truly feel empathy for Arthur even though he has none himself and this film not only helps to put the whole backstory into perspective in a way that's never been imagined before, but also truly unique and intense while retaining moments of dark humour even in some of the most depraved scenes. Absolute masterpiece!"
1090,"Joaquin Phoenix is utterly phenomenal portraying the birth of Gotham's greatest villain, the Joker.
This is a story of man slowly losing faith in humanity to the point of madness. We get to know the Joker first as Arthur Fleck; a sad loner who isn't well liked because he makes people uncomfortable. He doesn't have friends, or a special someone in his life, only his mother who he still lives with and cares for. Arthur does the best that he can, working hard as a party clown but he is down on his luck and the world he lives in is brutal. On top of that his dream of becoming a comedian is shattered when talk show host Murray Franklin shows a clip of Arthur bombing at a comedy club. Meanwhile tension in Gotham has been mounting as the poor have been suffering and they turn their anger towards the rich, who seem completely indifferent to the struggles of those living in poverty. It's the perfect recipe for disaster and chaos.
This haunting tale is definitely a must-see!"
1091,"Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime"
1092,"You will feel the joker alternation of his metal condition, when you watch moive"
1093,"What an amazing interpretation by Phoenix!
Also the plot is brilliant. Well done!"
1094,"The fact that the film has the best giggle so classic of Joker's hysterical laugh makes this film deserving of an Oscar. It certainly is a masterpiece, far outperforming Dark Knight and actually deserving a place beside Taxi Driver."
1095,"Probably the best, most compelling movie I've seen in a long time. Joaquin Phoenix is a LEGEND!!!"
1096,It's been a long time since Hollywood has put out a good film. This one will make you explore feelings you didn't want to and feel good about it. The story with Phoenix performance is historical. Every aspect of this was perfect. I can't believe how great this movie is.
1097,This film is incredible. It's harshly criticised for no reason. This film will impact modern cinema.
1098,"This is not a popcorn flick, very difficult to re-watch and a must-watch for all the Joker fans of the world. I'm a fan of Mark Hamill, Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, the Arkham games joker, the numerous comic book stories and the Gotham TV series joker and this one definitely deserves to be one of the best takes on the deranged clown. I heard that the weight loss took a toll on Joaquin's health, I hope he recovers as soon as possible. Regarding whether or not he deserves an Oscar, I don't think you need an Oscar to really brand an artist on how good they are if that were the case, Christopher Nolan, Will Smith, and Robert Downey Jr. would have a bunch of them. Nevertheless, I do hope he gets nominated.I was wrong in saying that WB doesn't know how to use the DC villains after witnessing that performance from Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor and the wasted opportunity to make Jared Leto the main villain in suicide squad. They just need to find the right directors and excellent writers that these characters demand. Well done Todd Phillips, Joaquin Phoenix and the rest of the cast for giving us something so fresh, not everything has to be a part of a universe and lead to bigger battles, maybe that's the reason the film turned out so well because it was under no such extra pressure. Maybe WB can learn from this and focus on making now movies like this because we've had enough popcorn flicks and team-ups and it's not always about the box office money, it's about sending a message.After witnessing 23 Marvel movies and DCEU's desperate attempt to keep up with the MCU and it's constant but pointless protest that 'They're different than Marvel', Joker was a bit of fresh air that I needed and all the comic book fans in the world deserve. Maybe the writing in this movie was as good as I think it is or maybe game of thrones season 8 lowered the bar because anything other than 'I don't want it' and 'She's my queen' made me want to applaud the writers."
1099,Poor plot. i find no reason for joker to become a complete psyco. so coudnt feel the character.
1100,"Yes, Phoenix is great, he always is. The Joker in addition to being a killer is also supposed to be a criminal mastermind. There were no signs of that in this character. If he's just a psycho killer Batman would make short work of him. Also, Todd Phillips has said that neither Phoenix or this iteration of the Joker would be appearing in any future Batman film. So what's the point then? You could have made the movie about some nameless individual and done your poor man's ""Taxi Driver"". It makes no sense. Five stars for Phoenix's performance."
1101,"Loved everything about this film, the vibe, the photography, the acting. All is simply excellent. Well done to all involved! Must watch for anyone looking for quality."
1102,"What an amazing film and piece of art. Joaquin played the role perfectly, absorbing the viewer into his dark world, his enlightenment and eventual breakdown. Beautifully filmed, with an enchanting amazing soundtrack too."
1103,"I watched this for about a week ago, on blu-ray. In hindsight I must say that I thought the film to be really good. I didn´t wanna rate it directly afterwards but rather let the experience sink in.I´m not an expert on the world of DC comics although I read a lot of the comics growing up (in Sweden). In Sweden the Batman character was (in the seventies) named ""Läderlappen"" (The Leather Coat) but the Joker was Joker(n). The most interesting stories for me was when Batman encountered the Joker. A complete madman, nutcase and homicidal maniac!
I give two thumbs up to Todd Phillips, Scott Silver and Bradley Cooper for taking this daring step. Credits due when and where credits due! Kudos also to Warner for giving the film the green light.
I know it doesn´t follow DC: s origin of the character but this is not that film. This is a parallel universe to that universe. This is more rooted in reality. With a twist, this could actually happen in real life. Come to think of it; just look at all the nutcases that has been and are very much alive now. Serial killers, sadists and paedophiles.This film also have one of cinemas most fascinating character developments ever! Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely fantastic! What a marvelous performance. In my opinion, it´s up to par with that of the late Heath Ledger. Before The Joker becomes The Joker, he is Arthur Fleck (gotta love that surname) who is a very(!) troubled soul already. From the first scene it is obvious that he is going down the abyss. Very sad and very heart breaking. The supporting cast is also very good. Especially Robert DeNiro (of course).
I also thought they handled the Wayne family arc and the tragic event that awaits them very good. Just looking at young Bruce Wayne in the alley after you-know-what brought tears to my eyes...The music is very fitting. Eerie, dreadful with glimpses of beauty. Production design is top notch. The colours are stunning.
The direction by Todd Phillips is excellent. None of that spasmic teenie weenie mobile cell phone swiping cutcutcut. The camera takes its time, slowly moving, following the character rather than directing it. Of course there are scenes with faster cuts when the scene deems it fitting but not all the time.This film comes highly recommended by yours truly!"
1104,"After seeing the movie at a theater I rated this film 10/10. However, after seeing another masterpiece, ""the king of comedy"", yesterday I had to re-rate Joker.Although an excellent film, Joker is just a remake of ""the king of comedy"". It pains me to chip of 2 grades, but an obvious remake cannot earn 10/10 in my book.But that's no reason not to watch Joker. It is worth a couple of hours of your time. Joaquin has earned his medal, his performance is outstanding. It is a moody film, dark, funny in its own quirky way.It is very dark, so although it is more or less a pure drama, it has violent undertones which makes it a film that requires a particular mood to watch it.There is no super heroes, nor any super stuff what so ever. So those of you who are DC/Marvel comic fans and expect bright neon colored jump suits...do not watch Joker. If you are into character development and hails great acting no matter what genre...do watch it."
1105,Great story and masterful performance by Joaquin phoenix.
1106,Good direction by the directors. The whole thing was well done and that joker laugh is just keeps getting better! Good movie!
1107,"I can only say that
Todd Phillips
Bradley Cooper
Emma Tillinger Koskoff
Scott Silver gave their best, that's why its the first R - rated film to surpass 1 Billion dollars and Joaquin Pheonix killed the character JOKER. Well thanks to you guys for giving me something to watch last year.# That's Life."
1108,"Cult classic with amazing acting ...not everyones cup of tea but for movie freaks its d best ,,reviews r not meant for such movies Nd Oscar is nothing for dis movie"
1109,"So one could say this is an origins story as it's not your usual superhero fair, not that Batman has any superpowers and is just a regular joe with a tonne of money. Joker is a brilliant movie which in itself explores the subject matter of mental health and me thinks is setup for a much needed sequel."
1110,Cinematic perfection & flawless acting. One of the best portrayals of the Joker we've seen yet. Joaquin as always pours his heart and soul into the characters and makes them memorable. What made this so good is that I felt I've met people like the characters Phoenix portrayed in real life. And that's what people look for in movies; a reflection of their own life.
1111,"""Joker"" is a thrilling film. That makes the audience feel uncomfortable from the very beginning. The first scene where Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) looks at the mirror sitting in front of his desk creates on purpose a moment of silence tension and first impression over the character of the joker. There are two main problems with ""Joker"": first it is an origins story, we've seen millions of movies that tell an origins story of a superhero so in this case it is not revolutionizing. Second, the movie is two hours in which we see a person with psychotic problems and how his life is miserable. So we get it, Joaquin Phoenix is an amazing actor and he could have won the award for best actor with no problem. I would have given Phoenix the oscar without even watching the film. The movie doesn't have to be two hours. The moments I enjoyed mostly were the last 40 minutes of the film in which Joker is at the top, he has changed and finally became the iconic character he is. Other moments I enjoyed throughout the film were the perfect moments of tension between characters, how Arthur Fleck's interactions with his surroundings cause tension and escalate. The soundtrack composed by Hildur Gudnadottir is perfect and ties well with the tone of creepiness the movie has. Though I'm not sure this movie came to my expectations. I've heard the enormous amount of excitement towards the movie and how everyone thought it will win ""best picture"". But once I saw it I couldn't understand it's success. Sure it is a new take on the joker's character but it isn't a movie that would be remembered as a revolution or on the same level as ""The Dark Knight"". It is of course a really good movie but I would tell you to lower your expectations."
1112,"I wasn't that DC guy, before the Joker announced. But after that i tried to get into the story. I loved every corner of Gotham and Arkham. I love how DC show villains true perspective."
1113,"It is much better than endgame
The creators are understand what people need
Thanks mr.todd and thank you mr.phoenix"
1114,"This movie was different...it took time for me to kind of digest what I am watching. The acting was amazing and I am the kind of guy who thinks Heath Ledger was the all time greatest actor for Joker. However, this movie showcases truly cringe-worthy acting that almost makes you feel uncomfortable. It is a great watch if you are willing to give the movie the time it needs to unfold and show its potential."
1115,There is nothing left to say about this film. This movie is PERFECT.Everything is good in this movie.
1116,JOKER is a masterpiece and that's all I have to say...
1117,"Joaquin Phoenix is an amazing actor that was wonderful in this movie. I applaud him even more because in order to live in the role of Arthur, he had to lose weight and practically starve himself.His performance was haunting, yet lovable, he lives a terrible life in which the movie slowly builds up his anger toward the world.It had amazing cinematography and was beautifully written. The slow buildup is all worth it when Arthur finally cracks when he is invited onto the late show with Murray.Fantastic movie, would recommend, though is a little bit disturbing, so I would be aware of that before watching.9.6/10 :)"
1118,"The real clowns here are the people rating this masterpiece of a movie with less than 8*. There is something really wrong in someone's head when he rates this movie with 1* like it's the worst movie ever made! Ok, we get it snowflakes, you want to feel different. Dissing this great film makes you feel good?
Believe me, just stay away from reviews like that, they don't even worth a glance. See this great movie for yourselves. At the least, I guarantee you will not waste your time."
1119,"Exactly the same thing happens today, I don't know if the writers knew what was going to happen but they seem Nostadamus"
1120,"While the film Pi delivers a variant of losing ones mind, this film is a perfect introspection on the hell and realities of psychosis. Enjoy!"
1121,"This is a movie that only those who have felt alone and isolated can truly relate to it. You understand the motive and you feel sorry for the character. A lot of people will see this movie and think that it encourages violence. But truly, this movie should encourage each and every one of us to become a better person, treat everyone with respect and make each other feel like they belong in this world, instead of making them feel isolated."
1122,"This movie had a big hype. I went into the cinema with high expectation
Within the 1st minute i realized not forget about expectations as this was something else. This movie was a roller coaster of emotions. I found myself laughing when the entire audience in the cinema was silent
and some the crowd was laughing and I could not fathom why
The Lead performance was mesmerising. the film held my attention for the entire duration and left me feeling worried and confused about my own sanity. It was, nonetheless, the best cinema experience i have ever had. With that said, a pert of me wants to study this movie and the other part of me never wants to see it again. BRILLIANT!!!!!!!"
1123,"Todd Phillips created a solo Joker film and made it rated R. When I first saw the trailer, I actually hated it. I was expecting brutal violence and I wanted to see the Joker go full crazy. I changed my mind when I heard the reviews and I went to the theater the next day.
I came out amazed. Joaquin Phoenix shatters this role effortlessly, and his performance was some of the best I have seen in years. Robert de Nero, a great actor too, does his part as Murray Franklin and is actually pretty likable. The score is haunting, mesmerizing, and kind of beautiful. This is the first movie that actually made me give a damn about the score in a film.This film needed to be made, and people out there need to see it. It is truly a cinematic masterpiece, and I'm not afraid to admit I have seen the movie twice in theaters, and even more at home. I truly enjoy this film and I truly recommend it."
1124,It's such a deep and realistic movie that phoenix deserves an Oscar
1125,"There is good in this film, I don't disagree there. It's certainly an ambitious film, and whenever a director decides to take a new route, I commend them. Todd Phillips decided to do something that most films aren't doing, but he didn't do it on his own. No, on the contrary, he stole from Martin Scorsese.""Taxi Driver"" and ""The King of Comedy"" references reign so much screen time in this film that it renders the plot completely predictable, and unoriginal. Phillips had an interesting idea, which was to detail how The Clown Prince of Crime was created. I'm a comics fan, and I'm not mad that they decided to do this. If only it could have been done better, instead of hiding behind the mask of homage, expertly disguising itself from the title of thief. In the end, it's a disguise. ""Joker"" does not pay homage, but steals.
The cinematography is beautiful and haunting, and Joaquin Phoenix delivers a powerhouse performance destined to connect and resonate with many people for a long time. I won't comment on the claims of the film being irresponsible with it's messages of violence, because The Joker is a violent character. I didn't expect to go to a Joker film, rated R nonetheless, and see him ""BOP!"" people on the head with a rubber hammer.What the film is irresponsible with though, is its plot. The script suffers due to an overabundance of ambiguity, and the inclusion of too many questions without ever getting sufficient answers. It raises several thought-provoking questions about mental health, corrupt politicians, and humanity, but only ever answers one, which is the concept of humanity. Treating others with kindness. That's a great message, and would have carried the film. But since there are so many messages stuffed in with that single message that don't ever get brought up again, it makes the impact of the humanity message falter.I can forgive faulty messages though, and if that was the only fault, this film would get a 7. The biggest problem though is simply this: Phillips over utilizes ambiguity to make the film seem more intelligent. Without the ambiguous elements, the film's script would just be cliche, but still quality. It would have one takeaway, which would be to treat others nicely. Here's the issue with overusing ambiguity.Phillips allows the narrative to be affected by Arthur's mental illness. I won't give any spoilers, but since Arthur is narrating the story, Phillips thinks that opening the doors to ambiguity, and allowing the audience to decide what is real or not will constitute an intelligent film. It doesn't. Instead, giving the option that everything wasn't real renders the film pointless. I think ambiguity in a few moments, at the end of a film mainly, is great. When it holds up the entire point of the film existing, and engulfs the legitimacy of the plot, that's a major issue. If the audience can decide if the entire film happened or not, you haven't made a worthwhile film.If the director doesn't have the skill to write a point into their screenplay, but instead throws in questions that would make good points, and leaves the options open like a choose your own adventure book, that does not make a good film. Films should not be made if the director has nothing to say. It's technically the click-bait of film. Saying that you're going to say something important, but instead telling the audience to decide, and lazily throwing ideas at them.Like I said, ambiguity is good in doses, and I'm not against it being used as the main method in telling a story, but it has to be done well, or else it threatens the necessity of the film, which should not lie in the audience's hands.Phillips steals from better films to utilize for his plot, shots, scenes, his characters, and their motivations, rendering the film predictable. He brings up questions and themes which would give rise to interesting discussion and answers, but he never engages these topics enough, or at all, to ever make an attempt at a deep dive. Instead of answering or discussing, he throws it all into the cavern of ambiguity, rendering the fate of importance to the audience, which makes the film feel unimportant, and desperate to be awarded praise. Phoenix does a masterful job, and the cinematography is gorgeous, but the unsubtle dialogue, and overall needlessness of the film doesn't fully allow me to be invested into the world.""Joker"" wants you to think that it has something to say. But it never says anything in the end, instead, it only raises the questions, mistakenly drenching the film in ambiguity, so the audience would give it the depth it tries to convince the audience that it has. It succeeds in some moments, but in most, it reminds me of a chocolate bunny. It looks tasty, clean, and well made on the outside, but upon biting it, you find that it's hollow."
1126,"Not too much more I can add to the existing reviews. Awesome movie. Acting superb, Phoenix is up there with Heath's. The atmosphere of this movie was so dark and dank. You felt the descent. Good exploration and take on this character whose backstory never seems consistent. This came across less campy than other versions. The cinematography alone was its own separate exhibit at a museum of moving pictures. I don't feel this movie should be missed."
1127,"No spoilers, just watch the film. Comic book fan or not, just watch the film. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this. Amazing movie, definitely worth the buy/watch."
1128,Joaquin Phoenix with a haunting/captivating performance. I couldn't take my eyes of the screen. A psychological masterpiece. It stands out among the rest in the superhero/villain cinematic universe. Absolute chaos.
1129,"Joaquin Phoenix's acting is amazing. Joker is powerful, disturbing, thought-provoking and possibly the best film of 2019 (I haven't seen Parasite). Definitely watch this movie, I don't think it's free on anything but it's just too good to not see."
1130,"Joker is a shallow, pretentious piece of work masquerading as ""art"" and ""social commentary."" Completely unoriginal.
The film just isn't as deep, substantial and ground-breaking as the internet wants you to believe. I've actually heard people claiming that this film changed their life. I'm sorry, but how? There is a copious amount of style but not enough substance. The entire film, save for the last 20 minutes, is exposition. And the send-off, while impactful, doesn't quite align with the rest of the film.
Everyone involved in the production has emotionally manipulated the viewers into believing that this picture is profound and influential. And it seems that they've succeeded in doing so, given this film's box office intake, accolades and mass appeal. I mean... all this controversy and publicity for what? There will be several Joker copycats for years to come: solo comic-book character based films ingrained in reality, with little action. Whether that is a good or bad thing is anybody's guess, but I personally think Joker probably (hopefully) will not pass the test of time. I can't imagine it being considered a seminal release. It just isn't as opaque and gritty as the herd wants you to believe.The expectations were high going into the film, I had been anticipating it for months and descended into the typical emotional trap of the hype. After completing it, the only words I could say to myself were... ""that's it?""
Indeed, it is entertaining and has magnificent aesthetics. Spot on portrayal of the dreadful ambiance of Gotham City. I'm a fan of Joker's new look as well. This is by no means a bad film (unoriginal, yes) but it's also not exactly the formative, manum-opus it's being marketed as. It's akin to James Cameron's Avatar in the sense that it's basically a rehash of previously successful movies and repackaged with new characters and a new setting plus tons of pretty visuals to galore at. And most of the general public will fall for it EVERY SINGLE TIME. As for the influence of successful films from the past: some will call it inspiration, others will call it plagiarism. But at least Avatar was a ground-breaking technical achievement in cinema history. The real saving graces of Joker are the performances of Mr. Phoenix and Mr. De Niro (who appears sporadically), the cinematography and the score.
I have nothing but excellent things to say about Joaquin Phoenix's acting performance. The man truly submits to the role and has once again proven his method-acting skills. The Academy Award was well deserved. Such an exquisite acting job. He works with what he's given and triumphs in doing so... except there isn't exactly that much to work with.Some scenes truly are heavy and thought-provoking, but in the end you walk away feeling hollow and one-dimensional due to the absence of clear take-away messages. Sure, that means it's ""ambiguous"" and every viewer will get to interpret the film for themselves. But that almost means the writers failed to give us an adequate narrative.Joker examines the destructive impact of mental illness and transcendence into violence from a very surface level perspective. I expected a much more well-layered, intricate psychological analysis on the the mind of a deranged mass-murderer that makes the viewer comprehend why he did what he did, and even spread some awareness on mental health and the importance of professional help for suffering individuals. I typically do not watch movies expecting lobbying or advocacy of any kind, but it just would've felt appropriate in this context. The character study element just seems rushed and isn't deep-rooted or showcased well enough to make the viewers care. Under-stuffed and undercooked. Many of Arthur's decisions feel arbitrary or redundant, some just for the sake of unnecessary violence. I'm not prone to violence at all, but for a film that takes itself THIS seriously, it better be justified or serve a purpose. Yes, the social structure is evil. But society cannot be blamed for the root cause of every single evil. Some negative desires and ideologies are pre-conditioned in one's psyche. The film has Joker conveniently blame society for all its wrongdoings against him, playing the victim card, without having him acknowledge his corrupt cognitive drive even once. Some folks are evil and have an ambition to kill because they're just designed that way. Mental illness and prejudice doesn't mean one will guaranteed go around shooting people up, those things aren't mutually exclusive and I wish the film explored this.Todd Phillips' Joker seems to have an identity crises from its inception. Maybe I just don't ""get it"" but there doesn't seem to be any discernible theme, motif or cerebral reasoning. A crazy man with existential dread becomes crazier. The on-screen performance would've been intolerable to witness if it weren't for Joaquin Phoenix.
As others have stated, this iteration of Joker doesn't appear to be intelligent or ingenious enough to become the notorious, sharp-witted Joker we all love to hate or hate to love or just love. It's hard to believe he'll be able to conquer Gotham City into his dominion and be able to form a cult of dedicated followers with at-best only average IQ.
Getting a little nit-picky here but, if Gotham City is afflicted with such social/political unrest and diverging class boundaries, how have there not been several ""jokers"" before Arthur Fleck?Seems like such a depressing place to be a part of the lower socioeconomic category and a seemingly exemplary city to have a mental breakdown in and decide to become a serial killer overnight. It's hard to believe that Arthur Fleck has been the town's trailblazer, inadvertently setting off a domino effect of protests and rebellion.
It's not entirely important but the film tells us there are many fallacies in Gotham City's social hierarchy system but doesn't show how or what they even are. All the viewers are informed of is the separation between rich and poor. Also, for a film that's supposedly a stand-alone feature, the inclusion of the Wayne household felt especially superfluous and out of place.The film is quite intentionally ambiguous, which some might claim is an artistic choice, but I theorize it's just lazy writing and directing on Todd Phillips' part. It's wanting to taste success but only being willing to commit to the bare minimum. It's ambiguous to the point that the audience does not even know exactly which form of mental illness(es) Arthur's suffering from and which experiences are delusions and which are reality. It's one thing knowing whether everything was a delusion or if nothing was a delusion. But here, you sort of have to put the pieces of the puzzle together for yourself and there's still no definitive answer. This is a filmmaking technique that definitely can work and intrigue the viewers, serving for a deeply visceral experience. But in the case of Joker it takes away from a meaningful viewing experience.
This film's direct plot isn't unnecessarily convoluted (it's quite frankly a little too simple) but there's several macguffins driving the story forward in a way that feels inorganic and contrived. There are plot points and character decisions the viewers witness which they think might serve real significance later on, but are quickly discarded and not brought up again.
I enjoyed the ending, especially THAT SCENE and that mini monologue Arthur gave. It was satisfying, thought-provoking and humbling but the buildup throughout the film didn't feel potent or well-crafted enough.Let's just be honest for a second... this film's script would've ended up discarded in some production studio's CEO's trash-bin if it wasn't about an already popular comic book villain with cult status, and if the script wasn't pitched to WarnerBros by Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix. And especially if the studio wasn't already looking to venture into more stand-alone DC films after the success of 2017's Wonder Woman. It also wouldn't have made 25% as much financially. Why? The plot and writing isn't distinctive or meta enough, and it isn't anything that hasn't been done before in the many decades of great filmmaking. I'm genuinely confused by those claiming this film is innovative and explores uncharted territory. You all must not have a lot of cinema experience.
Look, I HATE TO BE THAT PERSON, trust me, but Joker has been ridiculously overrated by fanboys and teenagers. Even critics aren't too crazy about it, given its polarizing reception. There is nothing wrong with loving this movie. We love what we love and shouldn't feel guilty about it as long as it's not unhealthy or illegal. But please do not claim this film is a ""masterpiece"" or ""one of the greatest films ever made"" without at least having quality, competent cinema to compare it to. I don't walk into every film expecting it to be a masterpiece. Not every film needs to have a deep meaning. Most don't. Not every film has to be good either. I have a bunch of sh***y movies that I love and can watch anytime because of how mindlessly entertaining they are. But the difference is that I acknowledge that these are sh***y films and wouldn't argue against it. The problem with Joker is that is has already become something that it's not, and most of the masses have fallen right down the unscrupulous rabbit hole. These are just my two cents. In my opinion, this isn't what I'd call a masterwork of filmmaking. So many other psychological thrillers have done this way before and way better than Joker."
1131,"""Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?""
A Single film that has 11 nominations for the academy awards. Isn't this insane? What is Joker? Why Joker? Why this film has won many hearts? What spell Joaquin Phoenix has casted? Is he a ""Certified Legend""? Have you watched this absolute Masterpiece? If not, what are you waiting for bro?It is the story of a simple man, No, a man who is raised without father and by a Mother who has a psychological disorder.
A great round of applause for acting. You don't care what is going on around you while watching this masterpiece. You have a notification on your phone, Duh Who cares? I don't wanna say another thing about it other than I HAVE ENJOYED & FELT This film.
But I have one question in my mind and please share your thoughts and correct me if I am wrong. Are we brave enough to acknowledge that maybe we are THE REASON of someone's trauma? Maybe we have hurt anybody so he or she is not able to face the world, him or herself boldly? I am not talking about the movie; I am talking about THE JOKER. What was the reason of him being that psychopath? How much hurt he was? How people used to make fun of him. How much pain he has inside of his heart? Believe me when I say that these characters are not fictional. They EXIST. They are running, walking, eating, laughing so hard around us. When it's time for a payback, who are we to judge?
THIS ONE IS FOR ALL OF YOU!"
1132,"Joker is one of the few movies of this time that I went to see in person, and boy was it worth it. No other crime film has given me such goosebumps that Joker has given me. And no other film ever will. I don't care what wannabe movie critics like Peter Bradshaw say about this film, because they're wrong and sold out.This movie tackles the degeneracy of our society in such a bold manner that it leaves people shocked. If I had to explain someone about dark humor with a movie, I'd suggest them this. And as a cherry on top, this was a very low budget film. Instead of the usual circus party CGI graphics we see from the cinematic universe of comic films, this movie uses traditional tricks like powerful color grading and what not.I vehemently stand against anyone who thinks this movie is anything short of a masterpiece. A must watch, this is"
1133,One of the best dramas I've ever seen. The context was full of instructive messages rather than a lot of nonsense action scenes. The background music and the comedy were great too the leading actor was brilliant. Really perfect.
1134,"This movie does everything right when it comes to telling a story via film. The cinematography, score, acting, editing, and storyline are all excellent! The main reason I am not giving it a higher rating is because I found it hard to enjoy. To be fair, the movie is not intended to be a joyful experience. It feels uncomfortable on purpose. For me, personally, that keeps me from wanting to watch it again,l. For others, that might make it a 10/10 movie."
1135,"The movie was extremely good, the story and cinematography were all top notch.Watch this masterpiece, but don't expect a superhero movie."
1136,"A brilliant work with amazing Easter eggs and so beautiful cinematography and performance, just a new modern classic that has to be untouched like taxi driver. Hope they don't make a sequel."
1137,"Phoenix delivers another great performance to his already outstanding career. That's what the 8/10 is for. The rest is just an homage to Scorsese - a nicely rendered homage, nonetheless."
1138,"There are not many options to have an opinion on this one. There will be people who won't understand the character, and there will be some who cant take it. And finally there is us, understanding and feeling it.I must say I love this new era of detail-oriented atmospheric beautiful movies with a lot of love for compelling cinema like Irishman or Once Upon A Time In Hollywood and this one.
Reminds me of good old days when junk food movies like Avengers and stuff like Transformers were not present. When movies like Fight Club, Seven, The Silence of The Lambs, Green Mile, Gladiator, Memento and many many more movies were being released.Joaquin deserved this Oscar with an outstanding performance. Period.
A true masterpiece in any sense.But Im sad they gonna make a sequel. Most likely will ruin everything.
A better idea would have been to let Todd Philips make a Two-Face or Penguin movie in the same manner."
1139,"For someone who does not understand the background of the role of joker, watching this movie is very confusing in some aspects. In particular, the narrative of the movie itself is intertwined with reality. I can understand that maybe this is an artistic expression, but maybe it can be edited better. It is undeniable that the theme of the movie and the performance of the actors are excellent."
1140,"Devastating Masterpiece!
It is an iconic picture which deals with the real image of our society!"
1141,"This is Tod Philips first serious film and for what it is it's pretty good . It has good cinematography and acting and it has good music . The direction is also quite good . However you can tell this is a film from someone who has only directed comedy films . It isn't bad , its actually quite good for a first time , but you can tell it isn't as clever as other films like it . It isn't a masterpiece like people say , but it's pretty good . I think most people will enjoy this film if it sound interesting to them ."
1142,"The music visuals are good and Joaquin does a pretty good job , but generally the film feels a bit beginnerish , probably because the director is mostly known for comedy films and its his first serious film . Not to say it's bad it just feels like it's not implementing its technique in a masterful way . It's a start but no amazing achievement like lots of people are saying . It's not bad by any means but it's no masterpiece . I'm interested in what Tod Philips will do after this , I feel like he could get better if he made more films like this ."
1143,"This is the greatest Joker film I've seen. Like every other Joker, Joaquin Phoeinx added a unique touch to this great and controversial character. He is not overacting, he is not too crazy. He is consistent throughout the movie and a joy to watch. His laugh is absolutely brilliant, no wonder he had to practice it so much. Totally worth it, great job.But enough of Joaquin's praises. Time to move on to the story itself. I came into this movie totally unprepared, ready to watch another Joker film. This wasn't another Joker film, this was the Joker film. So many things can be said about what was presented to us, especially Joker's origins. I'm not going to spoil it, it's just not worth it. You must go and watch this piece of treasure.Also, forgot to mention, that this movie doesn't just tell the Joker's story but criticizes our current society and its deep rooted issues. If you are attentive enough, you'll realise that and you'll sit down and really think things through. Believe me."
1144,"I actually don't have anything bad to say about this movie. I cried, I laughed I empathized watching it. One of the best movies I have ever watched in a really long time."
1145,"I have always just thought The Joker being in his mindset from day 1 of being born, I never thought of him turning into his well known character over a period of time. Joaquin Phoenix really embraced the role of The Joker and delivered a performance that is on par and in some respects surpasses Heath Ledger's version. Let's face it everyone who sees this film is going to be comparing it to Heath Ledger's classic portrayal.The psyche of The Joker has always been a huge question mark and Joaquin Phoenix does an incredible job in creating a version of how he came to be in the iconic character that we know today. After the scene where he murders the 3 men on the train you seriously see how Arthur Fleck goes from a man who just a nice everyday person who has taken some harsh hits from society to Gotham's Clown Prince of Crime and how he transcends from one to the other. To use another example people often judge a person's performance of The Joker with their laugh as it is one of his iconic traits. It had never crossed my mind that he could have developed this trait from a head injury and therefore at some points it was hard not to feel sorry for him when it happened at a bad time. The pace of which Joaquin Phoenix creates his character change into The Joker was at a slow pace and as the film went on you see him go deeper and deeper into the mindset and it just grips you the more it went on.In the end Joaquin Phoenix's performance is easily in deserves of an Oscar and as said before in my opinion it is on par with Heath Ledger's performance>"
1146,"The best DC in history. The best Joker in history. It's the most original comic joker. The joker portrayed by Phoenix performs extremely well, whether they can't restrain the pain under the laughter, the inner struggle behind the wry smile, or they want to laugh, but they have to pretend they can't laugh. All of them are telling the story of this terrible life step by steps. At the beginning of the film, the story of the ancient times is slowly pushed forward, and a series of attacks are completely out of control and outbreak after knowing the truth of his mother. This is the real track that happens to every bottom people in the society. Almost all of them choose compromise and tolerance. So there is only one Joker in the world. At last, the dialogue in the studio shows the life of the Joker's heart. So I believe remember the core values of socialism, and live in harmony in a civilized society is important."
1147,"I'm 34 years old, I've seen a ton of movies, horror, action, etc...but very few films have gotten me to feel as many emotions as Joker.Horror and awe are just a few emotions this film brought out of me. This movie will be remembered as one of the greatest versions of the Joker ever imo, Phoenix deserved his Oscar."
1148,"This movie just takes the cake. I strongly believe that there is no perfect movie. But oh boy does this movie come close to it. Phoenix did an amazing job at portraying the Joker. You know the feeling when something is just right. Yeah, thats what I've felt watching Joker. I could write so many things about this movie, but I don't need to. Go watch it and be amazed. No more words needed!"
1149,"I don't watch many superhero movies. ""Batman & Robin"" is my favourite Batman movie, because it seems to be the only one that acknowledges how childish and ludicrous the whole premise and all these ridiculous characters are, and has fun with it by having a sense of humour about its own stupidity.I think that probably illustrates how much serious thought I've put into the deeper ""meaning"" or ""themes"" behind this franchise.I thought ""The Dark Knight"" was well done, but after seeing ""Joker"", now I think I hate it. Because Joker is a movie I actually have continued to think about, maybe more than any other movie of 2019.The Joker in The Dark Knight was written as a psychopath who ""just wants to see the world burn"", and who blows up hospitals and passenger ferries for no reason. He commits arbitrarily contrived terrorist acts apparently for the sake of making Batman's brand of vigilante justice seem unquestionably heroic. Bruce Wayne is a billionaire advanced-weapons-enthusiast who considers himself above the law, but in the morally unambiguous world of The Dark Knight, that's a good thing, because Batman is the hero, and he stops the Joker, who is obviously the bad guy.It's suddenly dawning on me that most superhero movies basically reflect the worldview of your average NRA member.The Joker in ""Joker"" is a far more sympathetic character, a mentally ill man made victim of an uncaring society that doesn't have adequate measures in place to help people like him. Those who don the plastic clown masks are not mindless thugs for the hero to leave strung up to a lamp post, but rather they're the working class, protesting rampant social injustice and inequality.The way these extras are depicted as anonymous criminals in previous Batman movies, and suddenly humanized in this movie reminds me of the facile way that corporate media characterizes protest movements around the world with different vocabulary, according to patent ideological biases. Hong Kong demonstrators against communist China are part of a ""pro-democracy movement"" and above media criticism even when they're hurling molotov cocktails. Those in Chile protesting a US-sponsored fascist government with a 10% approval rating are automatically ""violent rioters"".What is so impressive about the way ""Joker"" was written, and what makes the movie so unsettling, is that it IS morally ambiguous. The Joker, and the movement he inspires, do very bad things. They become the violent rioters. But they are also pro-democracy protesters, the 99%, and I sympathize with them more than I do the Waynes - the billionaire mayor who doesn't give a s**t about these people.The movie is a cautionary tale, I think, about the use of violence to achieve political ends: if we're going to have revolution, it needs to be non-violent, or else we're walking a dark path. But perhaps more crucially, the movie is a cautionary tale about capitalism: a system of incredible wealth inequality, with a massively underserved underclass, is eventually going to blow up, and maybe violence is inevitable. So we'd better change the system.I'm so sick of comic book movies, I wasn't really expecting very much from Joker. It's very well done, and Joaquin Phoenix gives an incredible performance. But what's most surprising to me is that I'm still thinking about it, chewing on some of its themes, now weeks after watching it. I guess that's the mark of a great movie."
1150,"Long story short the story of the movie shows who exactly the joker was before he even became the joker. What makes the film so special is the performance by Joaquin Phoenix. I really feel as though there was no one else that could have made the film so iconic but him. The way he acts made the audience really like to believe that they are watching someone mental and insane. It really gave this film a very eerie and dark atmosphere.
Many people like to compare Joaqin Phoenix's Joker to Heath Ledger and in my opinion I do not think it is a fair comparison. Not because Ledger is bad( in fact he is one of the best) but it is because he is the joker based off of the comics. While Phoenix's Joker may strongly resemble the character's comic book counterpart, I feel as though he went out and did his very own thing. The new joker is totally realistic the way he laughs, hallucinates and even moves around. This is why the movie Joker is so good, never before has anyone done such a relatable Joker .
Lastly, the film succeeds with its musical score as well. This one in particular compliments Phoenix's portrayal very well. Put together a scary good portrayal and almost haunting score make this film work on so many levels. Altogether, I feel like Joker was a lot more successful than it was expected to be which just makes more reason to watch this film if anyone has not yet."
1151,"What can we say after that ? This is a REAL and unique MASTERPIECE at all level ( scenario, acting, editing, etc.). Far away from others 'vilains' movies out there. Don't miss this gem."
1152,This is a nice movie :)
1153,"Mr. Phoenix's performance and investment in this film is undoubtedly the best performer of the 2020 Oscars. At the same time, he also breaks away from the traditional Batman series of movies, giving a refreshing look, let us welcome the revolutionary nature of the new film king Acting"
1154,I'm very appreciate to all actors and crews. Good job! Joker will be a legend.
1155,"The film features an original script that shows the distance between superheroes and contains an isolated story of a guy with problems faced by ghosts of the past.
A narrative presents a different perspective from who or the character is shown in a caricatured and manic way, here, however, it offers a study of behavior about characters, which makes us delve into the complex head of the same. Fragility, mental imbalance, financial problems and difficulty in social integration are hinted at as the perfect scenario for the transformation of characters, but on the other hand in the narrative it does not use justification of future actions, showing only the impartial way in which these crucial facts for a conversion of dopersonagem, who is not placed as an unjustified hero, but with attitudes fostered by a shallow and inflamed speech to justify as violent actions.
Our immersion and perception of the personality that becomes terrifying is inevitable. The sequence between scenes makes total connection in the way that our attention increases the rhythm of the transition, the scenarios and the nuclei of dialogue perfectly with sadness and depression transmitted by the
character and feature film still manages to make the proper connections with the other films in the sequence."
1156,"Not, in my view, the masterpiece it is claimed to be, but certainly enjoyable and highly watchable comic book film that extends that genre into Scorsese psychopath territory. References to Taxi Driver and King of Comedy appear to be an attempt to deepen the character of the Joker here. These references also have the reverse effect, however of making you miss the relative subtlety of the the films being referenced. That said, the lead performance is enjoyable to watch, and so self-confident in its masochistic wallowing it is not surprising that young men in particular relate to this film and see a lot of profundity in its pessimistic view of a man's place in modern urban living. The anti-hero's inability to fit in, get a job and a girl, make him all too likely a hero for young, out of work guys struggling to be males today. Good performances in secondary roles and background detail, gritty photography and interesting use of music add to the overall texture and enjoyment. So great entertainment, great as a comic book film, but too black and white in its world view of rich and poor, or too self-contained in the central character's head, minus the necessary irony/tragedy, to make this truly great."
1157,"Most of the time movies are anticipated like this they end up falling short, way short. Joker is the first time I was more than happy with the hype. Please ignore the complaints of ""pernicious violence"" as they are embarrassing to say the least. We haven't seen a comic movie this real before. If we ever ""deserved"" a better class of criminal - Phillips and Phoenix have delivered. This is dark, Joker IS dark and you will fall in love with the villain as you should. The bad guys are always more romantic anyway."
1158,"This is a really good movie, really explained how the JOKER came to be the wicked person he is, Joaquin Phoenix did a great job as the JOKER, I recommend watching this movie"
1159,Batman's Dad is such a jerk. Joker now my favourite character.
1160,"Arthur Fleck's story will make you feel some sympathy for this man that has a seemingly lonely life working as a clown entertainer while still living with his mother. He laughs inappropriately - a laugh that's so full of pain that it will make you cringe, and hands out cards letting people know that it's a medical condition. As his story builds, you can begin to wonder what's real and what's delusion. By the end of the movie you understand a little bit why the Joker is a wild card."
1161,"I loved this movie I though Joaquin was phenomenal and the overall tone was great, so far I've watched this movie 3 times!"
1162,"Started watching this not quite knowing what to expect. I'd seen some negative reviews from political types and sort of wondered what they were talking about. If you want a movie with a great story and actors that play their parts with realism then this is for you. Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of the Joker. He is so good it made me wonder if he's a bit crazy in real life. Unfortunately there is a bit of the ""elites are a bit too narcissistic"" to make the real elites in Hollywood comfortable enough to allow this movie the awards it should generate. The story moves along with no dull moments to make you want to get some popcorn. Leave your political opinions at the door rack where they belong and just enjoy watching a great movie."
1163,I love Joaquin Phoenix and he was a great actor in Joker. I just love everything in this film!!
1164,Recognize me in JOKER. A thought-provoking film about not fitting in and disappointments.
1165,"This movie made me depressed, upset, angry, empathetic, distancing and on and on. Joaquin Phoenix was superb. His performance overshadowed everyone else in the film which is unfortunate in some respect because I plan overlooked everyone and watched with amazement the performance he gave. What a fantastic journey Arthur Fleck went through.Yes I believe I recognized many of the angles of commentary watching and thinking about the movie afterwards. The strongest impression is how ""super heroes"" can be very polarizing and don't mean outcomes are always good. The other major impression was the lack of mental health assistance which we all know has had major impacts on society and even more so on the people who could be helped. This was a movie of name all the stereotypes and perceptions you can name. There are a lots.The movie had one glaring drawbacks that I believe could have been dealt with without asking forbearance by the audience as it did. When Gary witnessed the bludgeoning of Randall (wow was that intense, the interaction of the three in the scene) and the subsequent cat and mouse with Gary how do you explain that he did not run to the nearest policeman he could find. What did he do, appears nothing. This is a loose end that is glaring. Another is the pillow scene in the hospital. The movie needs a better cause and effect when it came to killing.Everything was layered when it came to mistreatment by Arthur but when Arthur was doing his thing it was action/cut move on and don't deal with the consequences. Perhaps we don't care about victims.I give it an eight. Don't get me wrong it was a good movie but for me the loose ends keep blurring my view of the movie. Is this a character study or a warning about society? I guess both. Just a little sloppy on the story line."
1166,This movie is amazing....
1167,"The aura of Joaquin Phoenix at work again in this standalone 'drama' by Todd Phillips. The word 'drama' is important for this movie in particular because if you're looking for the conventional madness and the psychopathetic phenomenon that the name ""Joker"" always brings, you would be disappointed. Joker is as much a movie about Arthur's fall as it is about Joker's rise. For the most part of the 121 minutes, we see this really poor and pathetic figure of Arthur Fleck, living with his single-mother in a not-so-pretty apartment, and working amidst continuous abuse and ignorance of the rich kids of Gotham City, while struggling to make it as a stand-up comedian. Arthur Fleck is the typical portrayal of the left-out loner, who is beaten down by the unforgiving capitalist society, and finally able to assert power and control by means of violence. This is not a new concept. But, the real deal is the way Phoenix makes the character his own. The whole movie is seen from Phoenix's (Arthur's) point of view, and I could not find a scene as such in which he is not present. It is not so easy to really convince the fans of 'The Dark Knight' trilogy that Joker could be someone other than the exceptional Heath. But, somehow, Joaquin Phoenix as Joker, right from its announcement, seemed right. He is phenomenal throughout the movie. The screeching laughter which looked physically very troubling for the actor to execute on so many occasions, is going to be remembered for sometime. Only someone as eccentric as Phoenix could've made this kind of a portrayal possible.
However, there are a couple of things which needs to be addressed here. Firstly, the divided opinions about the movie, with many of the critics questioning the negative message that this movie sends to the audience. The argument of the nihilistic portrayal and making violence fashionable through this movie is really devoid of sense. This is not the first movie and won't be the last to portray violence. Secondly, and this makes more sense than the previous, the movie does not really have much in it besides Phoenix's brilliance. Not much happens for the most part of the movie, except for Arthur's painful laughter and somewhat catchy dance-moves. That being said, the movie does end on a high with the metamorphosis of Arthur into Joker taking centre stage and chaos unleashed.
This one leaves us with hope for something bigger and surely, the next installment will see the Joker we all saw and loved through the years.
This is not a movie about Joker, it is a movie about Arthur. Remember this and you'll love it."
1168,"Only those who experience/d abuse, disrespect, disregard, injustice, violence, misfortune, negligence, humiliation and rejection from a very young age, will understand the feel, the need, the desire for justice, fairness, revenge, vengeance from all humans (family and society) ""in loco"", if possible. ""Joker"" is not a so fictional character. Unfortunately, there are plenty of joker's out there who were mistreated, neglected, and abused, by factual inferior human beings, that have gone free without there well-deserved punishment. This union of talent and capacity forces of Todd Philips and Joaquim Phoenix just had realism into the story. Plus, from a neurologic point of view, it showed us how a sociopath is made. Particularly, how the pain and suffer that leads to depression and pos-traumatic stress disorder, can change the brain chemical balance, the reality perspective, and, ultimately, the personality; transforming us into a confident, fearless, courageous, and vengeful human creature, but still with a sense of justice. It's also a positive point of this movie conception, that the introduction of the ""Batman"" story was very well determined and written. Let's cheer up to this corrupt and violent society that we live in! At least, they made something right this year: to give the Oscar to the most brilliant actor of all - Joaquim Phoenix. Thank you."
1169,"Movie was very well done. Id recommend it to most people. I love how they movie makes you sympathize for him, I did not feel bad for anyone who died. And he spares the one person who was actually nice to him. Lets hope the second one hes gets darker and crazier"
1170,"Everything was a masterpiece, an amazing work from Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix.
Well deserved Oscar Joaquin !!"
1171,Very dark and very compelling. Superb movie. Joaquim Phoenix is outstanding. Really hope they do a follow up to this movie
1172,Well done movie. Joaquin's natural oddness is perfect for his role. Worth watching and looking forward to a rewatch.
1173,"I've just sifted through a raft of gushing 10/10 reviews so thought I'd add a bit of balance to all the hyperbole. Is Joker a decent, well-made, well-performed film that's worth seeing? Yes, undoubtedly. Does it warrant the rampant pant-wetting it's received? No, not really. To be blown away by this film you've either lived quite a sheltered life or not seen many movies prior to the last couple of decades. Has it been done better before? Yep. Is it a bit of a clear rip-off of a couple of obvious movies? Yep. Was I sat there for two hours waiting for what happened to happen? Yep. A supposedly shocking movie should not be so predictable. Our expectations really have been watered down by endless dross over the last few years. Decent - if not very good - but, hey, let's not get carried away."
1174,"Ok, so before I watched this for some reason I wasn't expecting much, but holy cow, this is one of the best movies ever, I was rooting for him(joker) all the way through the film (yes I know he's bat shit crazy) and that is because of the fabulous was Joaquin Phoenix played it. Amazing x"
1175,"I have to say that I'm a big fan of Joaquin Phoenix and I can say that he really nailed it while playing Joker. Movie, itself, is very emotional, but for my taste, a bit to slow. The drama kicks in at times, but it feels like the movie is lacking something. Maybe it's my subjective point of view, since most people like to say that it's the best movie of 2019, but I think it's a bit exaggerated.
Still, I think it's worth to see it. The movie has great cinematography, plot is great, acting from De Niro is also worth mentioning, the score and the screenplay are great, too, still I think I seen better movies last year :)"
1176,I've been thinking about this movie for two days. And I still have some questions. It was a remarkable movie. So many messages. Food for thought. The cinematography was absolutely great! The actors were so good. And dear lord. Phoenix killed that role. He was unbelievable. He totally deserved that Oscar. A movie you must watch.
1177,"I really enjoyed this movie, i think that the movie is very thought through and have undertsanding movie line"
1178,"Joaquin is hypnotizing portraying the sad and depressed Arthur Fleck who gets enough of his surroundings dissapointing him and as a consequence becomes the legendary Joker. The movie is worth the watch for Joaquins acting alone, and the oscar he won is well deserved.The movie is not flawless though. The plot dragged on but the philosophies on society were interesting, and feel like they were inspired by the state of the world today."
1179,Reading some of the reviews on here i don't think some people realise that this is a batman spin off. Anyway fabulous performance from the joker. Obvs other films on the way.
1180,"In a city seething with class antagonism, the mental illness of a struggling clown flourishes into messianic and murderous insanity.Woah! That's a bold story, and the lead role does it justice, as the character becomes a sort of hall-of-mirrors reprise of Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, with uncanny poses and dance moves. And of course, de Niro is present too, with shades of The King Of Comedy.But you can see the problem right there, with all the emphasis on the actors and not so much on story or theme. It is engaging, and well paced and edited, but a bit linear and simplistic. Maybe comic book heroes are fit only for comic books, and expecting them to take on the injustices of the American Way is to ask too much. At least they had the guts to go for it.On reflection, I think maybe the concept started in too low a gear - if you state that we live in a crazy, mixed-up system, the audience is already with you. What we really want to see is the dawning of the Age of Joker, as the mantra Life Is A Joke infects everything, even the most innocent thing, until we realise Joker is an inevitable outgrowth of the jokers who run this system.The sound is very good, with a constant hubbub of tinny TVs, the guy in the apartment upstairs shouting, ""Shut up!"", and the din of Gotham's chaotic streets. Also, the music keeps reminding you of Sinatra's genius for hitting unexpected notes that are just right. Most interesting part of the cinematography is the giant architecture.Overall: Interesting, not awesome.ps. The best line is a clever gag nicked from Bob Monkhouse: ""When I was growing up I told them I wanted to become a comedian. They laughed at me then ...."""
1181,"This movie showcases joker not as a character but an ideology which is common in our society. How a depressed person is trying to adjust in normal society yet he found discomfort from the people ignorance for mental disorders which leads to creation of one of the best character in cinematic history ""JOKER"". This movie clearly depicts how a mental illness can take shape and take a disastrous turn against the same society which shaped the person in its current form. Mental Illness is no joke and this movie captures the essence and darkness which follows such conditions. Joker is a masterpiece in every aspect be it Acting by Joaquin Phoenix, Excellent cinematography, Direction storyline. This movie leaves a blank space which only a sequel of this movie can fill."
1182,Convincing performance by Joaquin Rafael Phoenix. Intense and dark just as ordered. Phoenix is a shoe-in for an Oscar!
1183,"I really liked this film. Like its one of the most beautiful tragedy films i have every seen. But I watched it with my friends and they didn't like it. So if you like slow, tragedy and good acting films. Go for it."
1184,"A look inside mental illness for the pop culture. A peek inside the world of a man on a downward spiral. It's a must watch for Joker and DC fans. It's unlike any other comic book film ever made, but anything involving this particular character ever is. Mr. Phoenix is at his best. Feels like something he had to get off his chest. Wonderful."
1185,"Joker did not provide all the glitz, excitement and action that most superhero/Marvel/DC films tend to have, what it did have is the backstory on the Joker. The intro to his meeting Batman as a child, laying groundwork for the future of the two. I appreciate a film that can cause the viewer to have empathy for the villain and this one did just that. Phenomenal acting by Joaquin Pheonix. He was cast perfectly as he puts his all into all of his work and superbly played the Joker. All in all a well enjoyed film that leaves me looking for the next."
1186,"Fantastic actors though I miss the real Gotham atmosphere. Here it feels too much like a real life city. Opposite to the series « Gotham » which starts where the movie Joker ends.
Not the best entertaining movie for me but still a very good one."
1187,"Joker is a great movie with a great performing Joaquin Phoenix and all in all the movie is a really fine piece of a drama. But, and this is a big but, the Joker and story of the movie (Wayne Senior a rich numbhead, Clown movement as a civil outrage - here we get all the modern zeitgeist and pc stuff again, and of course bad and bullying guys wear suits etc.) does not fit into the canon of Batman and Gotham City. The ""real"" Joker you rather get in the new animation show Harley Quinn (a good one!) - I just cannot detect much of the genius evil madness of the ""old"" Joker in Phoenix's one. As a drama I would rate Joker 8 or even 9 but as it is sold to us as a Joker movie 6 it is.Last note: if you are able to shut down all the stuff you know about Gotham, Batman and the real Joker, you will enjoy Phoenix's Joker, if not, you probably won't that much."
1188,Joaquin Phoenix performed as if the part were written just for him. I was really amazed how he was able to display multiple emotions with one face gesture. An oscar worthy performance. I hope more actors and actresses will do a role justice the way he did. Bravo!
1189,"Just watched ""Joker"" and I realized I have got to start ignoring criticisms around ""controversial"" films. Like Jojo Rabbit, Joker was getting criticized for things that have nothing to do with what is on the screen. I was hesitant about it because after some reviews I imagined it would be full of the moral relativism that imo, tainted Zac Snyder's ""Watchmen"", (and which HBO recently corrected.) But Joker is magnificent. What some were calling nihilism, I saw as a warning. Like the ""joke"" Phoenix tells DiNero before a critical moment: ""What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash?""... What you deserve."". That single line encapsulates the fundamental theme of the film. Wonderfully acted and directed. Dark, yes, very dark... and unrelenting about that. But it's beautifully subversive. Not nihilistic. There's a difference. I think it's on par with V For Vendetta in that regard. Sort of V meets Travis Bickle. It's a great continuation of the trend of deconstruction of superhero archetypes. I particularly loved the re-framing of Thomas Wayne from the comic's heroic billionaire philanthropist, into a Bloomberg-esque entitled mayoral wanna-be with a mouth full of the standard trickle-down nonsense. And I must admit Joaquin Phoenix truly does deserve best lead actor. He is truly captivating and frightening. The direction, editing, superb. The ironic use of music didn't come off as trite or manipulative as, imo, it did in Scorsese, Irishman. To be honest, I am still biased towards 'Jojo Rabbit' for best picture. That film is closer to my heart. But Joker is a powerful piece of work, and I won't see it as a crime if it wins. (If Once Upon A Time in Hollywood or The Irishman take the trophy, I would see that as a rip off because both are overrated, imo. Good, meticulous and all that... but overrated.)"
1190,"We all are Jokers and by the way who or what makes Batman a hero?This review is for those love movies and also know of how everyday a Joker is rising up to, so please show your loyalty or patriotism to your country and countrymen who are suffering and needs your attention because your fighting for the movie will not help and is much more suited for real issues plaguing our society.You can watch or love or understand this movie by keeping expectations real of how Joker resorts to his acts for which he is known for or by sympathizing Wayne who is the symbol of corporate supported and politically backboned. And how or why people become Joker or how Joker ends up doing such acts. But we all know the reality we live in, isnt it?The film Joker is not merely a standalone comic movie or a part of villain stories by DC comics but a tale of psychology of how such characters exist in our society and most importantly how such are grown by the politics of people at top that doesn't give a. If you are thinking that Joker is a film from some alt universe or something futuristic then you don't live in your society where everyday a Joker is taking birth and everyday corporate Wayne is not helping them and the govt overall just ignores and watched for the apocalypse. Whether it is Trmp's administration of divided and selective politics or of Mdi's divide and rule from his days of 2002, you have it all. There is no difference between developed country or developing country or even underdeveloped one. We all are facing politics from top who wants nothing else than our death and miseries.Coming back to the film, Joker is an outstanding and phenomenal film that lives and stays evergreen because of Joaquin Phoenix (forever dependable and trustworthy) act as the Joker and not forgetting the writing (Todd Phillips, Scott Silver), direction (Todd Phillips, unexpected), music (Hildur Guðnadóttir, beautiful) and most importantly that is unknown to a lot of people, the Cinematography by Lawrence Sher, which actually makes the film look like a periodic, neo noir, dark and psychological thriller film different from what Marvel haven't done due to being Disney and DC where everybody at top wants to do what experts know how to do by themselves (see suicide squad and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice). This film is telling that superheroes aren't clean or villains completely villainous in their becoming of a villain for a hero of whom we know to little or nothing at all.At last, if you are still unsatisfied with my review, then you can sit in front of TV or staring at mobile and wait and see who makes a Joker a Joker and a Batman a Batman?"
1191,"8.5/10I was gripped from the offset, even during the relatively slow segments. I think this was mainly because the Joker's character is intriguing, in addition to the great storyline and the unpredictability.*Pros*Strong opening. The opening scene was powerful and gave us a great introduction to the Joker.Engaging story. I particularly liked the contrast between his life, and the fact he's always laughing / smiling all the time. And the reference to how people expect those with mental illness to act a certain way (whereas in Arthur's reality he has a facade).Unpredictability - which evoked an element of fear and curiosity as to where the story would go.Great pacing. Every scene was so seamless that it didn't feel that we were watching 'scenes'; it just seemed to flow as if we were watching a day in his life.Amazing cinematography. I particularly liked the scene where Arthur was dressed in a bright joker outfit, and there was a distinct contrast with the dullness of the city.The casting was on point.*Cons*The ending was too abrupt.To explain, I felt the movie just dramatically ended with a lot of loose ends left unaddressed (e.g. the apartment incident, the storyline with his neighbour, and the times on the clocks throughout).
However, the most prominent fan theory offers a possible explanation as to why it was so abrupt. If that theory is true, then it would have been beneficial to end the movie with a quick flashback to different segments in the story to clarify. In a similar format to how 'The Prestige' was done.
The violence was possibly too realistic and could lead to copycat behaviour. Arthur seemed to grow in confidence and find himself, the more violent he became. So effectively the violence was a positive thing for him; which isn't a good message to send the audience.To conclude, if they had tied up the end of the movie more nicely, I would have probably bumped the rating up a point. Although - all in all, it's a really enjoyable movie. With a great story, that was told really well."
1192,Joaquin Phoenix carried this film completely. There are no supporting actors. He is a special talent. It's not the run of the mill movie.
1193,"From the first shot onwards, you're drawn into the world of Arthur Fleck. The slow descent into the madness, the history in his family, the world thats constantly pushing you and finally, when he snaps, the feeling of liberation. The music is a fantastic accompaniment to the mood of the film as Arthur from being pushed against the world, breaks free and takes control of his life, albeit in a manner thats totally destructive. Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal. Up against the obvious comparison to the benchmarks set by Heath Ledger, Jaoquin holds his own and sets the stage for the origins story. Obviously, the two story arcs don't exactly match but the narrative is close and the mood is soberly set. There aren't the typical Marvel/ DC movie large action sets and mayhem taking place with the camera moving all over the place. The movie is set closer to the characters, showcasing the flaws, cracks and choices one makes - either by design or by forced by circumstances larger than yourself. This year, no other actor has done something this remarkable and clearly, this is the year of recognition for Joaquin. It is a joke that is having the last laugh."
1194,"When Batman made his debut the year was 1939. In Europe, the nazism was offering a solution to poverty: the chosen and pure ones have to take the lead to organize a better life. This fascist thing was also in the air after the communism had shown its contradictions and violence. With the victory in the II World War liberal democratic countries had to propose a new version of capitalism. This human version, the Welfare State, went through more or less till the 70's when the neoliberalism arrived in the political scene advocating cuts in social expenditures and state shrinking. In a way, Batman and Joker were created from the same ground of despair and hope in the mid of the last century. We are now in 2019. The welfare state capitalism is in the hospital badly wounded. The evil may be explained by a real troubled life of the Joker maybe not. As Joker realizes his potency after every crime perpetrated by him, the young batman must accomplish a double task in the future: to turn Gothan city a livable place for all and to dismantle the joker's way of the necessary use of violence by the dispossessed. If Batman fails in this noble tale, the fascism will come again to organize the jokers promising a better life. Great Film!"
1195,Not the best movie ever as described by some people but by far one of the best performances by an incredible actor as Joaquin Phoenix
1196,This film certainly lives upto the hype. An eye opener. Gets you thinking. 10 years ago Heath shocked the world with his performance and unbelievably making the character his own Joaquin is just as good.
1197,This version of joker is so far the best because the movie was all about him i do nit remeber any scene without the joiquin on it
1198,"I'd say that this movie is the best that I've seen this year. It took a turn from the cute and fun Joker that Jared Leto provided to a Mind blowing Joker of Joaqin Phoenix. It was stunningly beautiful, but very disturbing that I'm almost unable to finish half the movie. The cinematography is good if not the best, but what got me is Joaqin's movements, the expression on his face, the time of his breathing, and his eyes. I have stopped watching horror films because they fail to scare me. They just surprise me with sudden photos and loud music. This one literally gave me goosebumps and I had the creeps even after the show. For some weird reason, I was scared.DC has been a disappointment for me for the past years. This one gave me hope for better DC movies. I think they should focus more on the villains.Describe this move in one word: Haunting"
1199,"The beginning is SO slow. I normally love movies that start off with some non-action parts because I like getting to know the characters, however this movie was almost too slow in the beginning.I also dislike how dumb they make Arthur to be. Heath Ledgers joker was a master schemer, clever and not stupid by any means. Arthur in Joker is just an insecure slow guy who can't even spell. His killings are just like a guy that snaps and gets away with it for a bit. There's nothing clever or original.The one and only original scene that I wish the whole movie was like more was the midget / scissor scene. I liked the dark humor and the originality in this scene. You didn't know what he was going to do next. The rest of the movie you already know what's going to happen.He also laughs way, way too much. By the time the movie was halfway over I was praying he wouldn't go into a laughing fit anymore. The movie started to end well, and then they show an unnecessary extra scene with a closeup shot of Arthur laughing again.I love Joaquin Phoenix but I didn't like how dim they made him. I mean killings happen all the time in Gotham and there was nothing so inspirational about his first killings that would've made the whole city praise and worship him. He was just a dumb, damaged guy that got lucky.
This movie was just an all around feel-bad film."
1200,"The cinematography is outstanding and leaves an impression that's hard to erase. The focus on how Joker became himself pays off and makes total sense in the end despite it being detriment to society and, as such, prone to criticism from society as an invalid cause by axiom. So this film had to be made as an antidote to Batman universe backdrop.
His interactions as a person with characters you might meet any day of your life are genuine and without shallow disguise.. which makes the movie so tragic. Nevertheless, this is not the full picture. I personally enjoyed The Dark Knight's ""developed"" Joker much more though am very thankful to the author of this movie to put the effort to make this. A must watch."
1201,"Phoenix's finest work so far. I'm amazed how he managed to get so immersed into a deeply convoluted character. We didn't get soda or popcorn and all the same none of it would've been touched. Phoenix has a rare actor's ability to capture your entire attention with his stage presence, he's extremely versatile in his choice of roles and in the Joker in particular he flexes those talented muscles. To be able to convey complex emotions in a short period of time is so awe inspiring, huge credit to Phoenix he certainly did his homework and more so. I read somewhere that he read political biographies to get into the mindset of the Joker and I gotta say I admire his work ethic.
I was on the edge on my seat giggling, wondering, crying and gasping throughout the film.There's a fair amount of graphic violence in the movie and despite some critics saying it glamorizes the violent culture, first of all this is fictional and rational audience members ought to be able to put that aside when going back into the real world, second of all the Arthur is a product of a dehumanizing society and a horrible childhood. Hurt people, hurt people that's something we can learn from when rehabilitating criminals. We certainly feel lots of empathy for Arthur despite his criminal doings he's a traumatised human being, strip away all the makeup and the cursing and the guns there's a person beneath longing to be accepted and loved for who he is.
The only thing I missed from this movie was a bit more, it didn't feel like two hours at all, that's how good it was. 9 big stars from me. Do yourself a favour and indulge in this masterpiece."
1202,"I normally don't watch these twisted, psychological, dark and dreary type of movies. But, my friends wanted a boys' night out and I wanted to go.I was hooked from the beginning. The subtlety, the introspection, the clues revealing a tormented inner conscious. I never really did take my eyes off of the big screen, except for the three brutal killings that were too much for me to endure. I shielded my eyes with my buttered up popcorn hands.Other than those scenes, I was glued from start to finish.However, I had one hangup, with Joker as a leader. If he was going for Machiavelli, he failed. Napoleon he was not. He lacked the leadership quality that I would expect of an effective villain. I wanted to get behind his plundering and nefarious motivation, but he didn't hook me. Maybe a reading of Covey or Kabat-Zinn or even Thoreau would inspire the Joker to be less of an opportunist and more of a deliberate, Genghis Khan like figure.He didn't earn the role of villain. He fell into it."
1203,Nothing to say just to congratulate Todd Philips on this masterpiece
1204,"I can get why some people don't like this movie, as it is quite unsettling to watch, but that in my opinion is what makes it great. It pulls you in and makes you feel things, even if those things aren't exactly what you're used to"
1205,"Im not a Batman fan, actually I didn't even see The Dark Knight.
I just went to see this movie because my wife wanted to go out...
But after a couple of minutes I was totally in, glued to the chair and eating that masterpiece with all my senses. Acting, PHOTOS, music just WOW!
Unbelievable climate, colors ... Just go to the cinema, you don't want to see that at home."
1206,"Phoenix deserves all the glory that he is receiving for this role. Philip's is restraint and proves he is quite talented outside his usual comedy films. Joker is insane and utterly unpredictable. As a modern day comic book film, it has paid off. A darker DCEU was promised by Snyder, but BVS was a mess of idea's. Joker is interesting and thought provoking, something the MCU can only dream about. The Black Panther is not the Joker by any means, so expect to see this sitting at the Oscars. Ambitious and a film with longevity. Will Ratch Catcher be introduced in the future films? This could be a way of DC and WB separating from the core Marvel comparison. Lower budget, adult focused films. Time will tell."
1207,"When I first saw the set photos I was really excited, but I didn't have a lot of faith in the project. When I watched the movie, I was blown away especially with the symbolic scenes towards the end."
1208,"PART 1: Laughing - ""put on a happy face""
Arthur Fleck dreams of being a stand-alone comedian, whose best quality is probably filial piety (he has been taking care of his sick mother for years). He was affectionately referred to by his mother as ""Happy"" in the hope that he would always be smiling, always happy, and he also wished he could bring smiles to everyone. Ironically, going back in the past, perhaps his violent days affected his smile. He suffers from an uncontrollable illness, and when he does, he laughs and annoys people. The dramatic scene of his smile lies in the segment when he watches a comedy. People laugh, then he did not and vice versa. Or his gentle smile to her neighbor Sophie Dumond.
PART 2: A bad comedian
Arthur extremely admired Murray Franklin - he is a comedy host, has a strong influence on Arthur. He has the ability to turn Gotham's horrible problems into laughter (which is a kind of optimism) - but people like him, like Arthur, say ""have never stepped out of the stage"" to see life. out there like. He has absolutely no empathy for people in lower statuses like Arthur in particular and the Gotham people in general. He made Arthur laughed and Arthur now gave him an ending that he ""deserved"".
PART 3: Call me Joker
Before going on stage, Arthur had a little request with Murray, introduce him as: Joker. And a Arthur ""nothing to lose"" was completely different. Arthur - The Joker shows a confident dance as he prepares to go on stage and what Joker does, simply confess on Gotham TV. We have a truly internal Joker, no plan, no destructive things but the way the Joker works is really cold, not too gimmicky (this is for the soldier to do) and keep the item main destination.
PART 4: The end
My impression of the Joker is the perfect performance of Joaquin Phoenix. Is extremely reasonable music, as if going to teach you to know where to use teaching aids. A perfect scenario for the downhill, human frustration of Arthur. And contrary to many people, I was most impressed by the Jokers' dances, when I was happy with his mother, with childrens, when he was confident going to the studio and barbarians at the end of the film. And how barbarians enjoy yourselves."
1209,The movies makes you feel uncomfortable. You understand that what is happening is wrong yet you understand why...
1210,"I waited to see this post the initial first weekend hype but this film really did live up to it. It's a 9/10 for the film overall. The dark subject matter won't make any 'feel good' lists however Phoenix's title role is quite simply one of the greatest acting performances of all time. It's also a perfect origin story. Well thought through and brings a real sense of mania to the viewer. Moreover, this is just the beginning for this character and interesting to see how studio bosses will react to its undoubted incoming success. Go see."
1211,"First review but I simply felt I needed to share. Some people will not like it because this is a movie that certainly doesn't fit in todays style. I believe if you were to put the movie into a time it would well fit around the time Alien was produced. It is slow paced and portraits a real development of a character - unlike nowadays blockbusters that have nearly no character development.Personally I find it hard to compare Joker to 'The Dark Knight' . First of all due to the nature of them being different Jokers / different backgrounds, secondly even if they were the same, The Dark Knight is a way later and more developed Joker. I would love to see a sequel to this take but I am not sure if we will get one. Personally I enjoy Ledger's performance a bit more but thats personal preference, both actors did an outstanding job and in my opinion this is at least an Oscar nomination for Phoenix.Overall if you go into the movie, do not expect an action filled thriller but a portrait of a troubled man giving into madness. 9.5/10 for me."
1212,Showing what real society is. How a mental disorder can have a fatally final
1213,Best movie i have seen for a long long time..Do yourself a favour and go see it. Very few movies get me thinking of it days after but this certainly did...Masterpiece! Did i say i enjoyed it??
1214,"""Joker"" is gripping because it follows you around long after you've seen it, and Joaquin's character transformations control your attention. The film is also terrifying because it is a metaphor for today's unrest in society: the US vs. THEM mentality and where it can lead. A true work of cinematic art."
1215,"It's an old school movie kinda like Clockwork Orange. The scenario is so tied and no rushing. It makes the movie untouchable, or I would say bounded. This is why It's strong and old school."
1216,"First of all, you should know this is an outstanding and disturbingly realistic character study by any means
There may be some mild spoilers below
General Information: I am a huge Batman/Joker fan, my favourite comic-book movie ever is ""The Dark Knight"". I consider J.Phoenix easily one of the top 10 actors of his generation. I was disgusted with DCEU's Joker in ""Suicide Squad"" and really wanted this Joker to succeed. So yeah I was really hyped about this movie
This movie delivers everything you SHOULD expect. Phoenix is perfect in the role, when you see the movie you don't see him, you see Arthur Fleck. Thanks to his performance, Arthur is very sympathetic, tragic, even likable. Of course he is helped by truly great dialogue (The writers nailed that department). Even though Arthur is definitely mentally disturbed, he more human than any other person in the movie. He is trying his hardest to succeed in life, but every day of his life is even worse than the previous one (and we all know what a truly bad day can cause to even the most saint person). De Niro, Beetz, Conroy and everyone else offer great acting support.
The story though is the one that brings everything together, it's amazing in all honesty. The writers crafted a haunting, realistic, violent and very memorable origin for one of the most iconic characters ever. There are numerous unexpected turns and twists. A lot of the scenes are mesmerizing, among the best in Film History. I doubted T.Phillips was right for directing the film, since until now he was associated with comedy, I couldn't be more wrong, the guy gave everything and it would be no surprise he receiving an Oscar for his work. And finally Thomas Wayne is something more than a dead face in an alley (I admit though that the age difference between Fleck and Bruce is a little irritating).
I applause the writers for leaving a lot of the scenes open for interpretation by the audience
I have to talk separately for Phoenix's laugh (a defying trait for the character). Until now the best laugh for Mr.J belonged to M.Hamil (who a lot of people understandably acknowledge as the best Joker still), but Phoenix in my opinion beats him. Phoenix laugh is insane, disturbing (yeah I know I have used a lot this word in the review, but I can't describe it with any other way), depicts his derived personality perfectly and his inescapable decent to madnes (eventually), while making you feel uncomfortable
Now rightfully you may wonder why I gave it a perfect score. That's it for 2 reasons1)I didn't like Joker's costume2)The defying moment between Arthur and his mother in the hospital could have been even better easilyIt's tragic if you think about it that (probably) we will never see Phoenix's Joker again, and to make it worse we are stuck with Leto's version...
(For those of you wondering, in my opinion, H.Ledger is still in the top!!!)
Rating: 8.8-8.9/10
GO WATCH IT!!!"
1217,"It has been a long time since I have left a theater thinking about the themes and overall message of the movie. The film got me thinking of everyone's place in society and the treatment and amount of respect they all receive whether they be rich, poor, or middle class. The film was able to convey the struggles and ambitions of the lower class through the well-defined protagonist Arthur Fleck, played brilliantly by Joaquin Phoenix. Phoenix was able to add more depth to the complex character of the Joker by being the main character of the movie, which is missing in Heath Ledger's performance. When comparing the performances of Phoenix and Ledger, I would say they are both equally spectacular because they are achieving different goals in playing the character. Ledger plays the main villain in the Dark Knight who is going for a comic accurate representation of the Joker while also being threatening and horrifying to capture the horror of a terrorist. However, Phoenix wants to explore how the character can be terrifying through a character study that portrays the Joker to be a regular man with a disability being beaten down by society until he snaps and becomes a psychopath.Although the film is similar to Taxi Driver and other Martin Scorsese films in terms of plot, tone, and film making, the writer and director, Todd Philips, uses the characters of Joker and the Wayne family for social commentary that reflects the political and social climate of our society while also being an original Joker origin story. Something I respect from this movie was being able to separate itself from any previous DC movies in the DC cinematic universe and become a self-contained standalone low-budget movie that is a breath of fresh air for superhero movies. Another aspect I like of the film was how the media was portrayed that can resemble today from the violence on the news to the topics talk shows ridicule. Speaking of violence, I thought it was handled appropriately in a sequence of events that perfectly develops the ideology of the Joker and not make it feel gratuitous. The fantasy scenes could have easily been an unnecessary element in the film and would only be there from one of the films it was inspired by, but they were able to fit in thematically as part of Arthur's mental illness.I could see some people absolutely hating this movie either for the violence or the fact it's a comic book movie and there will be some people who will love the movie for similar reasons like mine. Whatever is said regarding the movie, it was a bit of a risk for the studio to release something that is against the usual superhero formula and still make a profit from it. In the end, I want more movies like Joker that can take an intellectual property and make something brilliant or weird from it, which may make money depending on how it is marketed and made."
1218,"The pacing of this film is perfect, doesn't miss a beat. No dead time, Phoenix is simply incredible. Who would have have thought this is the same guy that made the hangover and old school. (love old school BTW)
The only possible criticism I have is in the cinematography, missing the mark on one or two scenes. Specifically walking down the steps (not too spoiler)
I would have also liked the batman references to be a bit less obvious, but that's just me!
Left the cinema in elation, soooo good."
1219,"Definitely movie of the year, Joaquin takes joker game one step ahead"
1220,I went into the movie thinking it would be a typical superhero vs. Bad guy scenario. (PS: didn't even saw the trailer). Instead what I got was a astoundingly real and pure enactment of the things going on with society. There is no truer words spoken when the Joker commented on how we are programmed to classify what is right and wrong or what is funny and not funny. Sometimes we should question our decisions to whether our response is due to the years of programming done by societal norms or is it out of our own intention.Must watch!!!
1221,"There is no flaw in this film. From start to finish it is exceptional. Ths soundtrack is perfect. The darkest comedy I've ever seen and the mix of the two is balanced perfectly. When the final credits ended, I was left completely satisfied and knew what I had just watched was a masterpiece and easily one of the best films, if not the best film I've ever seen. I will be watching this film over and over again for the rest of my life."
1222,"Indeed a superclasss acting, definitely winning an Oscar for such a spectacular performance. The stort line is outstanding, the idea that rich folks can not understand is that the poor do not always want their foundation money, they only want dignity and to be recognized as respected human being, in my humble opinion the message was very well delivered in this movie. I stood and applauded after the movie ended, once again utterly brilliant acting."
1223,"This movie focuses on mental health issues, and how it can affect someone in a very negative way, which is why it's so great. It's realistic, not over the top, and it's something that we should all reflect on. On how we treat our peers. I've always been a fan of superhero/villain movies, but this will remain to be one of the best I've ever seen."
1224,Incredible movie which had everything. Phoenix was perfect.
1225,"The movie Joker centers around a man Arthur Fleck who is disregarded by society. The actor Joaquin Phoenix who portrays the character is phenomenal and definitely the best Joker after Heath Ledger. Joaquin Phoenix should definitely win an Oscar for his performance as Arthur Fleck aka Joker. This movie makes you actually sympathize with the Joker character and look at him differently. It is not surprising that this movie was well received by the audience and got mostly positive reviews from critics.How this movie plays out is not traditional. It is a character study of Arthur Fleck also known as Joker. The movie is set in the past where Bruce Wayne is a young boy and both of his parents are still alive. Arthur Fleck was the main protagonist and antagonist of the movie. He had a scene with Bruce Wayne and confronted Alfred. In this universe, Arthur Fleck was adopted by Penny Fleck and she saw how people abused him. It was quite shocking that Arthur Fleck may have been Thomas Wayne's illegitimate child, but that rumor turned out to be false.Joker is a terrifying and tragic story about Arthur Fleck who had a traumatizing experience growing up and was abused due to his mental state and his abnormal laughing condition. The movie is a definite must watch for Joker fans who loved Heath Ledger as the Joker in the Dark Knight."
1226,"Just finished watching #Joker and got to say Joaquin Phoenix's acting was absolutely brilliant I'd be very surprised if he doesn't get an oscar! Film maybe slow for some it's not your typical comic book movie but the acting, the feeling and emotionally bold storytelling is realistic yet dark. 👌"
1227,"Joker review 10/10-They way they built this movie to the point of his ""final"" breakdown was amazing
-Every time he gets ""hope"" it gets demolished and it increases every time
-They way they tied real world problems
-The cinematography and visuals are amazing
-They way they tied in the Wayne's
-Oscar worthy performances by Joaquin Phoenix"
1228,Joaquin Phoenix undoubtedly gave us the best performance of the year. Beautiful cinematography and score. Not much else to be said.
1229,"A lot has already been said about this film since it's release. It's a movie that will be hated by those who blindly overdose on the instant gratification and throw-away feel-good marvelesque movies, and loved by Dark Knighters who crave for brooding character development.It's not an easy film to watch. But it is captivating in a similarly slow-burn visually sumptuous way of past films it gives homage to: Taxi Driver, Kings of Comedy, Dog Day Afternoon and more. And similar to these movies, at it's heart is a central character whose slow slide down the ladder of society results in a series of pressure-valve-release gratuitous actions (towards the end).Whilst the movie misses a beat in using the stellar supporting cast to best effect, what it does do is act as a prequel to Batman that shows there's always two side's to every story. The Joker isn't born bad. And he doesn't knowingly derail young Bruce Waynes life. But ultimately he does find 'himself' in the events that unfold around his actions, and which snowballs through the media.It's here that a lot of the commentary on social extremism has been pointed, and with some justification. But what it really shows is that we all want to be treated as human beings. To be seen. To be heard. To be cared for. To be respected. To be loved. And to belong.Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker to find these things - that were missing in his life.It's here that it hits close to home, as so many of the events unfolding in our lives today are a result of similar sense of alienation and frustration with society letting people down. From a lack of compassion, care and respect for each other."
1230,My first ever review on IMDB and it's worth it .. The amazing Joaquin Phoenix had a difficult task on this role(Joker) as we will always gonna compare him to Heath Ledger and everyone who played the role before.The outstanding acting and the mood that Phoenix's is going to take you through is just phenomenal. Yes the movie was inspired by Scorsese's Taxi Driver however the joker has his own and unique act.I guarantee you won't feel the 2hrs of the movie GO AND WATCH IT ..!!
1231,"Great movie, just wish there was more joker when he becomes joker."
1232,"A masterpiece in the construction of a character. Magnific! This is something superior to everything seen in comics in the last decade! It's a mixture between taxi driver, the driver and the king of comedy. Shocking! The crown jewel of 2019! Joaquin Phoenix deserves a Oscar!"
1233,"A perfect psychological journey portrayed through the Joker appearance. A movie about humanity, the lower class of society and mental issues. Overall art work at its peak. This acting will be an example to all students. My guess is that he will get an Oscar.10/10"
1234,"After Heath Ledger's brilliant and deep performance of the Joker, I would not have thought that there was anything left in the character to be new or worth to explore. However, I was wrong. This totally new dark approach of the infamous comic book villain is perfectly fitting into today's careless society, where everybody just concern about themselves and the wealthy & famous people shape the trends like ""what is good or bad"" or what is ""funny"", and thus what have ""value"" to make money from. Thank goodness, there are still - very few though - filmmakers who fight for creating artistic and deep movies which are original and have something to say and point out. The time has not yet come when movie studios budgeting only movies with Tom Holland's abs with poor plots and sloppy conversations. Please, make sure it will never.This is truly a masterpiece, will be and should be a cult film."
1235,This is the first time I am reviewing anything on IMDB. I watched this movie yesterday. This has to be the best movie ever made. I have never watched a movie as fascinating as this. I don't have enough words to express my feelings.
1236,A long drawn out film. Nothing in comparison to the Penguin character's evolution in Gotham.
1237,"Just watched this in Bangkok , and looking around after the movie I think most people were expecting something completely different to what was on the screen.
I myself thought this was an amazing attempt at telling a familiar story without any big budget special effects or Marvelized story telling ( and trust me I absolutely love Marvel movies )
What I saw was possibly one of the best acting performances of my generation, and being just shy of 40 , I believe it's what people would have seen in Taxi Driver with Robert De Niro !!!
Don't expect a superhero movie , expect quite possibly one of the best psychological thrillers you will ever see , then you won't be disappointed."
1238,It was a symbol for world. We must learn not to humiliate anyone
1239,"No plot, no spoilers. We all face times when things just fall apart. Joker discusses that in a way no ever film ever has. There is a reason why this film is hovering around the 50th greatest film ever made. Just watch it, and remember - you're not perfect either."
1240,The movie is very very good and interesting. The actor Joaquín Phoenix is acted very well in this.
1241,At the risk of sounding edgy I'll just come out and say it. Joker is a pretty medicore movie. Does it has absolutely marvelous Oscar deserving acting of Joaquin phoenix? Yes. Does it talk about a touchy topic like mental illness? Yes but is it up there with the all time greats? No absolutely not. The story is pretty predictable and straight forward underdog guy rises up against the Machine and seizes the moment. This movie with a different script had the potential to be cinema gold. Just do a test apart from Joaquin whose character do you remember? Right? They made Robert de Niro forgettable! Not a easy thing to do. Don't follow the hype watch and judge.
1242,"This film is incredable. I watch it over and over, now it's three times"
1243,"Joker (2019) is a haunting tale of the transformation of Arthur Fleck into the villainous psychopath Joker. Todd Phillips really does something different with the backstory of the clown prince of crime. The character of the Joker (Joaquin Phoenix) starts off as a street clown who becomes so depressed and angry at the world, it drives him to murder. This movie is chilling from start to finish leaving you on the edge of your seat for two hours. You have no idea what he's going to do next. The film manages to show how society and people can turn some of the most caring people insane. While watching this film I couldn't say a word because of how intriguing and intense this film is. It's truly a one of a kind experience and a masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix has giving us an excellent take on the character. Perhaps the best yet!"
1244,"Main role surprisingly well played - emotions, thoughts...everything perfectly expressed. The story is also amazing. Watched it in the cinema and once again at home. Great!"
1245,"DC does it again! Great movie! Good acting, cinematography, plot, etc. All around awesome!"
1246,"Amazing:
-acting
-story telling
-cinematographyIt pays homage to previous jokers and surprisingly, this made me want to re-watch the batman movies..."
1247,"Out of the actors who played Joker, no one hit the zeitgeist in the head other than Joaquin Phoenix. An incredibly, maturely thought-provoking DC film, and arguably the boldest comic book story ever told. Marvel Studios clearly haven't taken a risk to make a risky, and ambitious film like this one in a decade."
1248,"I loved this film, the subtlety in details for example the use of stairs, the clocks, the lighting of a scene, all make this film the best I've seen. I love it and having studied it, I still love that there's no certain right or wrong answer to if it really happens. Great job"
1249,"People told me this was an intense movie, and seems like my friends either loved or hated it so I had to watch it. It's one to watch a few times though because there is a lot of layers of themes and subtext going on. Mental illness, social injustice, relationships, to just name a few. Joaquin Phoenix nailed the role and was captivating in his portrayal of mentally ill Arthur Fleck. Todd Philips is masterful in his directing of this film. It was disturbing and made me think for several days afterwards about people, life, situations, and how we treat each other."
1250,"A very wonderful movie. Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely excellent on his acting. He did the ""Joker"" character very deeply. I can't express my feelings for this movie. I was just speechless. Wonderful. Very Wonderful."
1251,"I can feel the depression, pain, rage and happiness out of his skin. Mind-blowing performance by Joaquin phoenix. That smile of his is amazing."
1252,"The film opens with Arthur in-front of a mirror; stretching his mouth upwards into a smile, a single tear rolling down his face. This scene was extremely powerful, both for Flecks character who struggles to engage with the world, and the audience (because who hasn't masqueraded their feelings behind a smile?)Following his everyday life, we see that Arthur is treated with hostility in almost every social encounter. Jokes are made at his expense, he is sneered at by others, beaten on several occasions (I felt every kick he received) & we feel hopeless that his situation will ever improve.As we are privy to his awful treatment (alongside the notes in his journal, his relationships with others -or lack of- and his constant battle with Pseudobulbar), we are much better equipped to align ourselves with his thoughts/motives and I think this is the crowning glory of the film. In light of this, we understand his rage against Gotham/the people who ridicule him & his vengeance is justifiable.In every scene, Joaquin Phoenix is hypnotic. At times I struggled not to wince at his skeletal stature. His metamorphosis into Joker was fascinating - and I loved that he chose dance as a way to express himself. The eloquence of the bathroom scene vs his charismatic shuffling down the steps later in the film was stunning, and beautifully shot. The scene on the Murray Franklin show was genuinely exhilarating (truly showcasing Phoenix' talents) whilst also criticising a society devoid of humanity & the dishonesty of the media.Hildur Guånadóttir's cello score was sublime. Fractured & mournful, it greatly adds to the films tone, alongside 'Smile' & 'That's Life'. Joker was my favourite film of 2019 (so much so I went to the cinema on 3 separate occasions) - a masterpiece from Philips as a director (may he ditch making films like The Hangover & instead delve further into the darkness of films like Joker).Also - Arthur helping Gary when he can't reach the door lock & kissing his head...tugged at my heart strings indefinitely."
1253,One of the best films I have ever seen. Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur makes for an electrifying but unreliable narrator who leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat. It is the kind of film you leave the cinema and are thinking about for days. An absolute masterpiece.
1254,"The highlights of this film are the gritty retro style and the acting. This film is a very serious take on a comic book character that attempts to make him more grounded, like a human being and not a legend. Joaquin Phoenix totally deserved the Academy Award he got for his performance in this film. However, it's no masterpiece. How many different tragedies can happen to someone in a week? That felt really artificial, as if the filmmakers had a checklist of tragic events and felt obligated to cram in every single one somewhere."
1255,"If I had one word to describe Joker, it would be a masterful piece of art transformed through a camera. Todd Phillips gave one of the best movies but just of The year, but if the last 20 years. Joaquin Phoenix gave one of his best performances other than Johnny Cash in ""Walk The Line"" and Freddy Quell In ""The Master"". He won best actor at the 2020 Academy Awards, which was well deserved."
1256,"Great acting by Joaquin, but, really, could movies get any darker? The whole thing was uncomfortable to me--I guess that's the point."
1257,"I tried watching this twice & I couldn't get more than 30 minutes in. It was the most uncomfortable awkward thing I've watched in a long time, couldn't sit through it."
1258,They might have won awards but this is basically the director telling an actor to act crazy and we will film it. It's so fake right down to his stupid laugh. At least when Heath Ledger played Joker he had a storyline and a script that was good to follow. This movie doesn't make any sense and has no real story. They make a movie about how they think a crazy person thinks and acts. HORRIBLE MOVIE!!!
1259,"The positives, Phoenix, the cinematography. Negatives, the screenplay, the pacing, the incredibly lackluster walk on performance by DeNiro who when not being directed by Scorsese shows up to collect a paycheck. This movie was less entertaining than a documentary on psychosis."
1260,I watched this movie and felt very uncomfortable.. joaquin made me uncomfortable.. the soundtrack made me uncomfortable.. the way society was portrayed made me unconfirmed..and I will not repeat this movie .. that's how good the performance was..
1261,I like Joakin Phoenix but his performance wasn't Oscar worth like Heath Ledger! The movie wasn't bad and the acting wasn't bad but this writer turned this into a slow joke with this music! I can see why people got upset about the mental ill aspect of this movie but a person with a mental illness pushed to the edge! It didn't stink but it could've been better and I wish it had been!
1262,"The acting was spot on, Phoenix did a great job, but the direction was weak and meandering, wasting precious time to ineffectively build tension, dragging out weak points and confusing the storyline at times, This movie could have been more intense with much better direction and editing out about 30+ minutes of filler that had the movie's storyline treading water for way too long. Their use of foreboding soundtracks and then nothing happening was also annoying. Stretching the movie out like the director did, really created a slow roll to the climax which everyone saw coming about an hour before it happened. By the time it arrived it was an anticlimax, slow boring movie with strong acting performances and really poor direction. Don't fall for the hype, it just doesn't live up to it in any way. Disappointed..."
1263,"I may be one of the very few to rate the movie so low, for such a highly acclaimed one. Joaquin's performance is excellent and the cinematography is crisp but otherwise, I do not understand the hype around it. The movie is slow with no plot worth watching. It was beyond my understanding of the character, the director, storyteller, or anyone associated with the moviemaker, wants to portray to the public. The best part is The End shown on the screen to convey that there's no more misery. Surely I wasted time watching it."
1264,"I see a man who suffers from psychological problems, and when he gets the gun, he starts to kill people to solve his problems because he excluded from the public. But killing people is not a solution EVERY TIME. The film is generally going inert and nervous."
1265,"No crazy action, no nonsense, no wild fake stunts, only top quality top of the top pure dark drama thriller.In my top 5 movie list of all time10/10"
1266,Joker is a masterwork of giant proportions. It evokes Day of the Locust juxtaposed with Taxi Driver. There are not words to describe the bravura performance by Joaquin Phoenix other than genius. This film is as dark as it comes so beware if you are faint of heart. Every cinephile waits for the day that films such as these come onto the scene.
1267,"The movie was all about Pheonix's acting.. which was really good. He deserved the Oscar. But, as a story it was quite boring. The story line didn't have much hold with the audience. Maybe people are raving about it because they are supposed to?? Same case as Once Upon a Time in Hollywood which was all about acting. If you didn't like both the movies then maybe you are not cool enough as per society... Just a thought!"
1268,"No denying Jaoquin Phoenix acting was fantastic. Moving is violent, sad depressing and slow. Those looking for anything that remotely ties this to the batman universe will be sadly dissapointed."
1269,"It wasn't a masterpiece. It wasn't even a great movie. It wasn't a bad movie but it wasn't what it claimed to be. It wasn't a comic book movie. It wasn't even a Joker movie. Except for a few shoe horned references to Batman lore it was just Falling Down with a little Fight Club and liberal amounts of Taxi Driver.The character of Arthur, though well acted, was too pathetic to be any incarnation of the iconic villain. He had no charisma or cleverness. His 'condition' of laughing inappropriately more often than not sounded like sobbing and when he should have been laughing, he didn't. When he smothered his mother, maniacal laughter would have been appropriate.The film fell victim to the same folly some recent horror remakes have. Child abuse creates monsters. Sometimes. We don't need to create sympathy for Michael Meyers or Joker. Psychopathy is scarier when you can't understand its root. Some people are just bad.The Joker is not a tragic villain and to portray him as such is the first indication that this movie was a marketing gimmick. Slap the name of a character with an established fan base on a pretty unoriginal story and make a billion dollars. Good job Warner Brothers. If this is the formula for the DCEU going forward, I see why there are so many rumors about closing down comic book production. Wouldn't want fans comparing the movies to the comics, now."
1270,"This movie may not be very comprehensible to people living in developed countries, but if you live in a country like Iran, all the scenes are tangible and painful for you
Our country now needs a JOKER right now"
1271,This happened to my buddy Eric! He lives in a society.
1272,"Despite the positive and universal acclaims this movie received I found it misleading. Misleading because like so many of its predecessors it chose to further establish the bold statement that people who are driven to crime are suffering from a form of mental illness. Nothing can be further from the truth as many gangsters and mobsters who had been caught committed numerous atrocities to either eliminate their rivals or to have a bigger share of the profit. Yet again Hollywood has chosen to so tired and often times tried cliche that he does it because he is insane and since Alfred Hitchcock's the psycho what better illness than the good old fashioned schizophrenia. Never mind the fact that many people can't differentiate between people who suffer from mental diseases and full fledged psychopaths who knowingly commit crimes to gain more money and scare away others. Making movies like this pinpoint this exact problem with today's society that people don't have knowledge, understanding and enough human compassion to be kind and understanding towards the less unfortunate ( and my isn't that ironic? Since the movie wants us to feel what is like to be the other guy? ) and discrimination is not only frowned upon but also celebrated. If few decades ago people would dare to discriminate against other races and people with different gender / sexual orientation, today they can ( with impunity I might add) single out the ones with mental illness and portray them as killers and agents of chaos."
1273,This movie was amazing! This storyline seems really realistic and possible. I like how it deals with health topics nobody wants to publicly talk about.
1274,"When the movie ended, my thoughts were: ""Wow, that was a really dark, depressing movie. And Joaquin Phoenix is an incredible actor.""After a few days to ponder it, I now view it a tremendous movie. It works on so many levels: The transformation of a mentally ill man to someone who is criminally insane. A dark origin film that takes Arthur Fleck, in an otherwise ordinary tale of woe, on an unlikely path to an eventual arch-villain whose unhinged randomness is his greatest weapon. And that transformation is not quite complete in this film, leaving room for moreThe cinemtography is ugly (in a great way) and sets the dark mood. The plot and the script do a great job of making Arthur's tortured existence palpable and sympathetic. Phoenix's physical performance is unbelievably good. Never felt so sorry for such a creepy persona. He's like a car wreck you can't look away from.Highly recommended. I'm looking forward to seeing where they go with this."
1275,"Review:
This is definitely a character study, more than your average superhero movie, which has superb acting throughout, and an emotional storyline which touched me in many ways. The dark tone is set right from the beginning, were we follow Arthur Fleck, a failed stand-up comedian whose descent into insanity and nihilism inspires a violent counter-cultural revolution against the wealthy in a decaying Gotham City. It did take me some time to get into the film because I didn't realise that the analysation of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) would go so deep, and the many knocks that he took throughout the film, along with his twisted family history, made it an extremely emotional ride. With his psychological problems, and society disregarding him, I couldn't help feeling sorry for Arthur, even though he committed several murders. It did make me think, ""What would I do in his situation"", and with no one to turn to, it's not a surprise that he turned out the way he did. You usually see concepts like this in documentaries, where they analyse the mind behind murderers, so that's why this movie is totally unique, and one of the best films of 2019. Joaquin Phoenix deserved every award that he received because his acting was out of this world. Most of his scenes were improvised, which meant that the director spent ages editing the final cut, so there are many different versions of the film on the cutting room floor. You definitely have to be in the right frame of mind to watch it because it can take you down avenues that you have never been before. When it had finished, it took me some time to get out of the dark mode, which is very rare, so I knew that the director produced something special. Personally, I think that it should have been released before Christopher Nolan's Batman because it would have fit perfectly together. It could have easily had nothing to do with DC, which I would have preferred in some ways because it touches on many elements that have nothing to do with the superhero universe. Anyway, I think it's a great achievement by everyone involved, and even though it wasn't intended on being a DC blockbuster, it's the second highest-grossing DC film to date, with Aquaman just ahead. That just proves that you don't need to have a massive budget, and a CGI extravaganza, to make a successful comic book movie. Brilliant!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Todd Phillips, who also brought you Frat House in 1998, Bittersweet Motel, Road Trip, Old School, Starsky & Hutch, School for Scoundrels, The Hangover franchise, Due Date and War Dogs. He's due to direct a Hulk Hogan biopic, which is in production, with Chris Hemsworth playing Terry Bollea, but the rest of the cast hasn't been named yet. As for this film, they plastered Robert De Niro's name all of the poster alongside Joaquin Phoenix, but I thought he was irrelevant to the plot. He did play a part in Arthur's complete conversion to the dark side, but I was expecting him to play a major roll in Arthur's life. I must admit, halfway through the film I called all of my friends because I thought that the Joker was Bruce Wayne's brother, which would have been a humongous twist in the franchise, but after watching more of the film, I realised that was a bluff. I'm amazed that it is the first R rated movie to make $1billion dollars, and that the director got his influence for the film from Alan Moore's comic ""The Killing Joke"", which tells the Joker's origin and descent into insanity, and the Martin Scorsese films Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and the King of Comedy. Sadly, Todd Phillips said he wants comic book movie fans to know that there is no chance of Joaquin Phoenix's villain and Robert Pattinson's Batman ever crossing over on the big screen, so this might be the last movie for this version of the Joker. I just hope that the upcoming DC movies take a leaf out of Joker's book!Budget: $55million
Worldwide Gross: $1.07billion (WOW!)Genre: Crime, Drama, Thriller
Cast: Joaquin Phoenix, Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Frances Conroy, Brett Cullen, Shea Whigham, Bill Camp, Glenn Fleshler, Leigh Gill and Josh Pais. 8/10"
1276,"Cannot say enough about the performance of Mr. Phoenix. OMG he is an magnificent actor and a master at his craft.
The movie was dark and very emotional, he made you feel what he was portraying...pain , mental challenges and most of all the hatred this caracter had.
Great movie.... GREAT performance.
Amazing how he can transform his body and psyche and become a character.
Amazing, Amazing. AMAZING!!"
1277,"I cried, I laughed, I trembled. Honestly I've never seen a better acting in a movie EVER! You will feel so much empathy and love for Joker! It is definitely a movie that leaves you with a bad taste but oh boy I will definitely rewatch it. Can't get enough."
1278,Todd Philips has created both a masterful study of psychology as well as a masterful study of sociology. And both absolutely to point regarding modern society. On top of this the acting and cinematography is brilliant. It's amazing how the batman saga has been successful across the full spectrum of ludicrously unrealistic (suicide squad) to heart-stoppingly real (this film).
1279,"Absolutely phenomenal acting in this movie!!!!! Although this movie can come across as depressing it's main affect on most people is the craving for more, people including myself leave this movie completely stunned and wanting more!!"
1280,The evolution of character from quiet introvert to manic enigma of chaos is brilliant
1281,This film deserves best picture over parasite. Joaquins performance was truly amazing and it shows how a mentally ill man can turn into a complete psychopath.i thought the haunting soundtrack suited the movie quite well plus the amazing cinematography.
1282,"To begin with, Joaquin Phoenix completely deserved the Oscar! He totally floored me with his mind-blowing performance...not a single flaw that can be pointed out. Playing a complex character like Arthur is no joke, and playing that character the way Joaquin did too is NO JOKE!The final talk show scene alone deserved 10 stars! Highly recommended to those people who do not wish to miss watching a masterpiece, and the legendary performance of Joaquin Phoenix."
1283,"Best acting I have ever seen, suffering while laughing..
Story was good. We saw how a person goes insane gradually."
1284,"This movie left me with a ""good"" sadness. Joaquin's incredible acting tells the story of a very unfortunate man with several mental disorders being abused and unnoticed by society. The beginning of the movie is establishing Arthur's character and made me feel uncomfortable, made me cringe, and made me immediately pity him. The film does not have a slow middle section which begins after Arthur kills the three men on the subway. From there the film gets very exciting as the killing gives Arthur a new breath of air. At least it seems to (in reality things are only being made worse for him). He begins to develop his true Joker personality by killing his mother for lying to him about his upbringing (being the cause of his mental disorders) and later devises a plan to kill himself on live TV. Before going to the show he also brutally murders an ex-coworker who gave him a gun which began all his recent problems. On the television show he decides to instead kill the host after being constantly mocked. This leads to his arrest and the final scene shows Arthur talking with a psychiatric nurse in Arkam Asylum.
Some say, going off the final scene, that the entire plot takes place within his head. I don't see it that way. I believe all the events shown were real and him being in the asylum was were he ended up after his crimes were judged as insanity being the cause of his murders. If the story was all in his head I think that would just be lame and everything would have just been pointless.
Knowing that this was just a standalone film made all the parts of the Wayne family seem out of place to me. I don't like how much was focused on them and a lot of it took me away from the main points of the movie. I know the Bruce Wayne is an essential part of any Joker story but I wish they were just a brief mention. I don't think this film would be as interesting, however, if it was about some ordinary guy. We have Taxi Driver for that. This being about THE Joker makes the impact special because we all already have a familiar understanding of the character.
Other than plot and acting being great, the film also looks and sounds very beautiful. The colors are a nice choice, the film is full of beautiful and memorable shots (stair dancing) and the music is very minimalist but impactful.
This film left me thinking of my own mental health and the mental health of others and how much they all probably need a good hug."
1285,"Its a risky film. It may have turned disaster but it achieves the tag of critically acclaimed and a movie for the masses, for comic lovers at the same time. Watching this take on the origin of the greatest villian in comics ever was delightful, emotional, thought provoking and disturbing at the same time.. Joaquin was at his career best"
1286,"Such a good film. The acting, cinematography and music are just incredible. A must see."
1287,"There is nothing like this! so much power so much hold and so real!. such a great work from Todd Philips! what he did in hangover and what he has accomplished via Joker is simply a work of art! such brains i must say. i must say that if Heath Ledger was alive, he would have gotten the role, but i guess he must be satisfied and so happy up there in heavens seeing Joaquin doing so much better"
1288,"Part of the mystique of the Joker is that his past is a mystery obfuscated by mockery and, like all good jokes, never needs explaining. I was worried that this movie would labour through a turgid dissection of the origin bit rather than add to the Joker legend but I was so wrong - this movie is perfect, so perfect that it even flirts with the hilarious notion that the Joker and Batman are brothers! How I laughed when hope of family was crushed.The Joker lives on, and all I could think at the end of this masterpiece of a movie was how awful it must be to have to wait so long for Bats to turn up and make Gotham fun!"
1289,"Never thought Phoenix could beat Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight, but Phoenix did the impossible - and there's no doubt - this movie is a 10/10.
After watching the film I was thinking that now I had just watched my very first superhero (ok, supervillain then) movie. Frank Miller would be proud - I hope, because this is the first movie from DC where I felt the atmosphere and story matched or transcended the best books. Ledger might still have delivered the best comic book Joker performance, but Phoenix just went beyond the books and made the Joker come out the books and made him into a real person. Like for the first time turning Pinocchio into a real boy ;-)I do think there might be an age problem though, unless we're going to see Batman beating up the elderly in later movies, but maybe some clever writer can fix that, lol.Note that Joker isn't for kids including young teenagers, not really because of violence, but this is a movie for adults. It's not funny nor is it an action movie, mostly I think - like Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns books - this is a film about society - a political film about wealth inequality and the consequences. A movie cleverly disguising and reflecting our current world. To quote the movie Seven:""Wanting people to listen, you can't just tap them on the shoulder anymore. You have to hit them with a sledgehammer, and then you'll notice you've got their strict attention.""and the Joker hits you with a sledgehammer like never before. You could say it's also a movie about the nature of being evil. - In psychology the term does not really exist, because being evil can be reduced to many different components, so is the Joker really evil - or sick - or a product of society - or everything combined (=sum of traumatic incidents and triggers)? That - together with Phoenix' godlike performance - make this movie a 10/10.BTW, saw the 4K disc version on a 85"" high-end Sony TV. The 4K version is reference when it comes to 4K image quality, maybe topped only by Mortal Engines. Blacks are really blacks due to HDR and the resolution is so high it feels like swinging a microscope over Phoenix face from time to time. I could even clearly see the dirt under his bitten fingernails - which was kinda gross. Also his dirty teeth, and every skin imperfection, all his hair etc. This movie was so disturbingly clear I was thinking that maybe the more blurry blu-ray version would be better, lol - but the clarity did add presence like (close to) never before. Felt like watching a stream of photographs. There's a small amount of film grain used, but you don't notice it in most scenes.Sound and music were awesome too, and the 4K disc contains Dolby Atmos sound as usual - in fact the music may be another reason for buying the 4K disc version - Joker got a second Oscar for the music."
1290,"There is an African proverb that says ""The child who is not embraced by the village will someday burn the whole village down to feel its warmth"".
This gem from the DC world has shown it how.
""Where justice is denied, where poverty is enforced, where ignorance prevails, and where any one class is made to feel that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress, rob and degrade them, neither persons nor property will be safe.""
This eternal struggle has taken the form of Joaquin's Joker, unearthing the hidden wounds of the society.
He had comically noted down ""I just hope my death make more cents (sense) than my life""
Joker itself is a living statement on this apathetic society and paves way for need of the Batman..
Miss this hauntingly beautiful transcending masterpiece at your own peril as movies like these comes once in a decade."
1291,"This is a cult film which will last in the cinema history. Manificent acting, totally underrated movie, cinematography, costumes, props and set design. If marketing doesn't play a big part of the Oscar contest this film must have all of them, even the music is awesome. As I said a masterpiece, a film to buy and have in your collection."
1292,"TLDR: Believe the hype, this movie is incredible.First things first, the score and Pheonix' performance are haunting and compliment one another beautifully, if anything you must see this movie as it is some of the best acting I've ever seen. This is the grittiest and most authentic depiction of mental illness to hit the big screen in my memory while simultaneously being the best comic book movie of the decade. All too often it feels as though the directors of superhero films forego details and realism in favor of maintaining a PG-13 rating. It makes mature moments in such titles feel cheap or corny, or they're chock full of garbage tier jokes for fear the ADHD ridden teenagers stacking theaters might miss the whole movie. This film holds no punches, cracks no jokes, and almost completely does away CGI. It's also clear that the director looked into real public programs for the mentally ill from that time period, as well as the horrible abuse Arthur suffered and how these factors coalesced making his metamorphosis into the Joker possible.The cinematography, editing, and camera work are all expertly done as well, but again the real attraction here is Pheonix's performance. He chose a very odd ballet style sachet for most of the movie, it feels unpolished and rough at the beginning and adds to how uncomfortable his character makes you feel. I found some shots hard to look at for extended periods of time, Arthur oozes self loathing in his forced smiles and small details like laughing at the wrong times during the stand up shows he attends. By the end of the movie however, he is almost dancing across the screen with such fluidity and confidence that it's clear Arthur is gone and the Joker has finally emerged. This progression may not have been rehearsed or intentional, but the depth of the character depicted just by movement alone is incredible to behold.I wanted to dislike this movie, I went into watching it not believing the hype and hoping that the critics were right to dislike it but here I am making an IMDB account just to gush about it. Watch it, watch it again, and remember this is the quality of super hero/comic book movies we should demand from here on out."
1293,"JOKER is astounding and confrontational. It covers issues like mental illness, class warfare, guns, societal breakdown, etc., while presenting a ""villain"" in Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) who is as sympathetic as he is terrifying. Filled with uncomfortable, even shocking moments, as well as unsettling comedic elements, some scenes will make many viewers squirm!Arthur is the overlooked, dismissed ""nobody"", forced to believe he doesn't even exist. He's a man in desperate need of help. Unfortunately, Gotham city isn't the place to find it. As his mind begins to shatter, Arthur has no idea what's coming his way. He simply finds his strength in a sudden act of violence, and somehow taps into the void within those around him, ultimately becoming a sort of messiah.The mesmerizing Mr. Phoenix uses his body as much as his dialogue to bring both Arthur and his alter ego to life. This is a movie to be watched and taken seriously, in spite of its comic book origins. It's as much a serious statement as it is entertainment. Multiple viewings recommended..."
1294,"It has been quite awhile since I have seen a movie in cinemas that is absolutely horrifying, thought-provoking, and could be considered an overall great film. JOKER kicks the door down and takes all of these accolades, as well as multiple Oscars hostage, with no Batman, or films of this caliber in sight to stop it.
Enter the gritty, decrepit, and timeless city of Gotham, where the rich keep getting richer, the poor keep getting poorer, and violence is at an all-time high.
""Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?"" asks Arthur Fleck, our central character played by Joaquin Phoenix. He lives in a small apartment with his aging mother, who reassures him that he was meant to ""bring joy and laughter to the world"" as he pursues a career in stand-up comedy.
You will not be waiting long to see this man's downward spiral begin, as his poor living conditions and mental illnesses are on full display, to devastating effect for the audience. Couple that with rampant crime, corrupt politicians, and the overall hatefulness of Gotham, and we begin to see the twisted, pained grin of the greatest comic-book villain of all time form on this seemingly kind-hearted man's face.
""They don't give a $#&% about people like you Arthur"", his psychiatrist tells him as she reveals that due to budget cuts, he will no longer receive his medication he so desperately needs. Scenes like this provide a constant tension, as the audience have some idea going in as to what we can expect from the title alone.
You will be right alongside him for the ride as his life and mental health deteriorate to the point that neither he, nor we, can decipher who to trust, what's real anymore, or if we even exist at all. Are his recollections accurate? What is wrong and what is right? Where is the line between justice and vengeance? It is these questions that are the strengths of JOKER, and where it truly shines.
By the time the credits roll, you will be left with these questions, but also answers that are beautifully weaved into the classic storyline by director Todd Phillips. Most important though, you will have a comic-book movie that steps outside the norm to remind you that sometimes the most diabolical villains are created, maybe by you...
The final punchline of JOKER is a solid 10/10.
""Goodnight, and always remember... that's life!"""
1295,"Ok I know I am late on this one....I waited till Joker came out on digital because I wanted to watch it without distractions. In reference to the job I do, I know the impact of mental illness plays in today's society. It is disheartening to see that people with serious and true mental health issues are shuffled in a system that over burdened and under funded. This does not include addicts and malingeres.I greatly appreciate this movie because it shows the spiraling decent of a man that needed serious attention. It shows the impact that abuse and domestic violence causes on the mind. This movie was panned by critics that couldn't wrap their simple minds that these issues in the mental health system, leave those who truly need help lost and tied to red tape.People need see past the comic book lore we have grown to know and see that this movie is a story on today's society and the violence that one untreated can cause.Look past whether or not Jaquine Pheonix deserves an oscar (which he truly does besides the point) and see that we need to take better care of those in our country that need help. We need hold the value of every life in highest regard and hold the oppressive bureaucracy accountable.This movie not just a work of art, it is a dissertation of the world today. Watch it and learn from it. It needs to be known that one man can cause chaos that affects the world. Every actor that has played the Joker has put there own spin on it. Romero was the maniac, Nicholson was the Narcissist, Ledger was the fanatic, and Pheonix is the reflection. He portrayed the most real and poignant Joker today. Hollywood take notes, people need a dose of reality sometimes and this movie delivered it."
1296,"A stunning performance by JP. I was totally transfixed. A study of all those dark depressing things we would rather not contemplate, but should not turn our backs on; this is life."
1297,"A cinematographic perfection. Causing audience to have a heart attack because of it's thrilling and exceptionally made scenes is what makes the whole storyline more interesting. With Joaquin Phoenix's incredible performance as Joker, this is the perfect movie to make critics and fans have the same view on a comic book movie."
1298,"What I have to say about this movie :
Really well directed
Great Interpretation by Joaquin Phoenix
It makes us think were we want to go as society and how we view mental illness
Great job"
1299,"Now that's the direction DC should head: deep into the darkness of the human psyche. I mean don't get me wrong, I love all the MARVEL movies but DC always had that darkness in its heart. Joaquin Phoenix's (well deserved) Oscar-winning performance as Arthur Fleck - thanks to a very carefully crafted script, led us by the hand, showing us how such a golem can be conjured up and moulded by its environment, and even as it is being created it is aware that what it is being turned into is the very thing it railed against."
1300,"This movie reminds me of a date I had last week. A funny, beautiful, smart looking person. We had a great time but I didn't had a connection with this person you know, that butterflies in your stomach feeling. I didn't understand why because she looked so perfect. I had a great time, but will there be a second date? No."
1301,One of the best films I've seen for ages. Phoenix deserves an Oscar.
1302,"If this is not the best movie of the year, Joker is at least the most ballsy, most daring, the most provocative, the most impactful, the most artsy and the most controversial film, and it even has one of the Best (if not the Best) performance of the decade. Joaquín's performance has the most extreme character arc in years. If that doesn't say something, I don't know what does."
1303,"Wow, what a superb story line, cinematography was first class, and a true acting masterclass. Wow. Loved it 👍👍"
1304,"Well done. Subdued but still intense in the beginning, it builds up."
1305,"I think the philosophy behind it it's great and the act of Joaquin is awesome! I would have liked it more if it wouldn't have had a the background story of Batman, so that it's just the idea behind what the character of a joker could be in the social view. No offense to the Batman fans!"
1306,Not a single poor scene. Not sure I've seen a better acting performance ever before.
1307,What a fantastic movie and an acting from Joaquin Pheonix.... Sure he deserves Oscar...
1308,"A movie like this, only comes along when the stars are aligned... The director Todd Phillips, can know he did the impossible... He made the audience feel, what it would be like to be in the head of the ""Joker"" All the loneliness and feeling out of place. This brilliant movie should have swept the Oscars. Now we know the Oscars, are more political than what real art is. How horrible to laugh, when it's not appropriate. I was uncomfortable during most of the movie... Never loved a villain like this, in any movie. Bravo!!!"
1309,"Joaquin Phoenix is unquestionably among the best actors of our times. His efforts on Joker should convince any skeptics.That aside, this film suffers from its comic book character heritage. It would have been more respectable if it simply purported to tell the story of a person whose personal misfortunes, including his loss of medical services, gradually shove him into a complete state of violent insanity. It's a story oft repeated in American society and it's worth portraying to garner better public understanding.Unfortunately most people pay their money to see a violent new comic book chapter. In this case, they spend most of their time watching the main character disintegrate from within."
1310,"""Joker"" was definitely not what I expected it to be. Joaquin Phoenix does a good job but ultimately I thought Heath Ledger was a better Joker. I was speechless watching a lot of the scenes and what keeps me from giving it a perfect score is I feel at times Phoenix was way over the top and a lot of it is in poor taste."
1311,"A mesmerizing journey through mental illness and descent into psychosis. If you like a dark film with well thought out scenes, creative and raw...this is for you. And you dont need to be a fan of batman or to have seen any of the movies. This film stands alone."
1312,"What a film, and what a fantastic bit of acting. Unbelievable!"
1313,"Never have been a fan of comic book adaptations. But what a surprise, this is a wonderful character study. A character born from a comic book that is not a caricature, wow. What a original vision to present this story this way. Very poignant. I am reminded of Taxi Driver but with a more sympathetic character. Joaquin, portrays a sadness that you can almost feel radiating off the screen. Definitely should win the Oscar for this. So glad I stopped my life for a couple of hours and watched this, now maybe Taxi Driver."
1314,"Joker is the latest iteration of the Clown Prince of Crime. After many different versions of the character, director Todd Phillips and star Joaquin Phoenix give their film a sense of identity by taking after Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. They do this by making this version darker, and more realistic to even greater extremes. Joaquin Phoenix gives such a stellar performance, he'd make Heath Ledger proud. Joker hits, and hits hard. It works as a riveting character study, as well as an unnervingly realistic depiction of mental illness.To say Joker is controversial is an understatement. The film deals with real world issues like mental illness, poverty, class wars, child abuse, antisocial behaviors, and anarchy. Many people will probably be put off with how disturbing the subject matter is. Others will see the film as glorifying antisocial behavior. Some will see it as mere entertainment. One thing that almost everyone can agree upon is this: this is one dark movie. Some people are afraid this film might incite real life violence. This film is similar to Fight Club, in regard that it comprises of crazy people doing anarchist things for the audience's amusement. Some people have valid concerns, however, Joker, although fictional, is a film that represents reality. There have been rebellions, and riots before, as well as class wars, and incidents incited by mentally disturbed individuals. Though the exact events of Joker have never happened in real life, they easily could. This film like most films should be left to viewers discretion. Art represents reality, and reality isn't always pretty.Some people may also be turned off by Joker's realism. The main character Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), whose alter ego is the Joker, is a man down on his luck suffering from a mental illness. This movie doesn't hold back by showing mental illness in all its ugliness. Crazy people have graced the screen before, but real life crazy is not glamorous in the slightest sense. You couldn't help but feel unnerved and disturbed by the sheer ugliness of this crazy crime-ridden, messed-up take on Gotham city. The world is so dark, apathetic, and brutal. The streets are littered with rats and other filth, government programs get shut down do to a lack of funding, and depressing scenery of busy toxic city life cram the screen. One can't blame Arthur for losing his mind.Something the film excelled at was getting the audience to empathize or feel bad for Arthur, aka The Joker. His life and the world around him is so soul-crushingly harsh. When the film starts out, he is not that bad of a guy. He cares for his ailing mother, works unfulfilling jobs, and fights his mental illness. The society crumbling around him creates the Joker. It's very realistic to see Joker unintentionally and indirectly starting all this mayhem and anarchy. He is just the straw that broke the camel's back. Joaquin Phoenix plays the Joker extremely well. He is more of a mentally ill man wearing clown makeup than a larger-than-life supervillain. Joaquin plays the character in the shadow of Robert De Niro's Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver, except Joaquin's character is even more socially isolated and disturbed.Joker is heavily influenced by Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy - two films that star Robert De Niro. Both of Scorsese's films deal with a mentally unhinged loner acting out against society in violent or antisocial ways. Joker tries to be a combination of the two films while molding itself into Batman lore. Joker successfully weaves its influences together without being derivative. If there are any criticisms, they are all minor - typical movie sins you find in most movies. To name a few, how does Arthur sneak a gun onto a Talk Show and how does he sneak into the Wayne theater so easily. Criticisms apart, along with two great Scorsese films, Joker stays with you with its compelling performances, disturbing subject matter, and shocking moments. Joker gets under your skin and lingers there."
1315,"The Joker I knew was a very clever man but he is very naive here. We don't see him using his intelligence in the film. The events that made him ""The Joker we know"" didn't convince me enough. Maybe that's why I couldn't make contact.His experiences in childhood. Rejecting by his father. Being raised by a mother with psychological problems. Yeah these are bad, it will ruin a person's life. But still he didn't experience events that could change his character that much. And turn him into ""Joker"".But okay, I consider this normal. Because the joker isn't normal. If the system had given him what he wanted, he probably wouldn't have been The Joker. This is thought-provoking.Which makes us think, is bad really bad? Or is it society that decides who is bad and who is good? Does society force us to be good or bad? Which is definitely what happens. We're not actually ourselves. We're just the people we're supposed to be. We are not us, we are them. If we're not who they want us to be, it's better for them that we don't exist at all.Even though so many people are uncomfortable with the system. We can't easily turn into the Joker. System is equipped with the powerful tools to deter us and protect itself. In Joker's world, conditions are more favorable. Therefore, the situation seems consistent in itself.The film talks about the awfulness of the society. But in doing so it uses superficial arguments that everyone is aware of already. This is still enough to mobilize people. Because, at the beginning of the film, the film already states that the situation in the city sucks. The Joker just pushes a little. Gravity takes care of the rest."
1316,If only Hollywood made more films like this. Gritty. Real. Raw.
1317,"Prepare to be devastated by Joker. Not so much by the intense madness and blood-spewing violence that is sometimes hard to watch, or the overwhelming central performance by Joaquin Phoenix in the title role, but by the vision and artistry of the film itself. Even if you hate it, it's unlike anything you've ever seen before-like waking up next to a poisonous snake nestled on your blanket, poised and ready to strike. You're horrified but unable to move. Regardless of my mixed feelings, I think it's the best film about the psychological effect of violence as pop art since Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange.Vigorously directed by Todd Phillips, who also co-wrote the unique if uneven screenplay with Scott Silver, and beautifully shot by Lawrence Sher, Joker traces the history of the popular DC Comics villain and Batman's arch enemy in totally original terms. After award-winning performances by Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger in the role, you may think you know the Joker, but who is he and where did he come from?"
1318,"I thought it was a good film but certainly didn't think it was a masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix does deserve praise for his acting as it really was excellent and the script was well thought out but it also was quite flat for long periods. I was hoping for a little more, especially after seeing all of the reviews, which is never a good thing as you go into it almost demanding it's perfection. I gave it a 7 because it was well made and acted but if anyone else was the star man, I mean an unknown actor without all of the hype, this film MIGHT not get the same recognition as it did."
1319,"I had been psyched since the announcement of the movie and then the casting of Phoenix. Never doubted him for a second; I was more nervous about what he would be given to work with; this all was super hush hush until the preview and then exceeded my expectations and then some. I'm not even going to get into comparing his Performance to Ledger. There's no comparison and wish people would stop already. 2 completely different movies and iconic in their performances. There's that movie every now and again that is truly outstanding, breathtaking and sends you reorganizing your top 10 list of all time favs. Joker was never a disappointment. In fact; it was perfect. I felt what I feel like the writer/director wanted and that was to feel his pain, his anger, his hate and disdain for a world that he never asked to be in yet was doomed from conception; rejected by society, abused, misunderstood, just longing to be accepted and loved but immensely socially awkward. In case that wasn't enough; he then keeps taking the hits..... his job, his Mother and past all lies, the government and healthcare cut and just keeps taking the hits. How could we all not relate to the King of Anarchy and Choas in today's world? I won't continue with the spoilers but the moment he breaks; you know it and he never meant to made a martyr or symbol; he was just tired of the BS and stood up foe himself by fighting back (initially). Anywho, super stoked and excited to see what the future has in store for Phoenix and the next movie and continued success. Not sure if anything is confirmed after that.
Phoenix deserves every freaking award he gets and dang well better as does the movie, writers and director etc. His laugh was also perfect! No other way to explain it; perfect! My money on the best movie this year was Tarantino's movie and it was great as expected; but this is the best movie I have seen in years."
1320,"Without a doubt, the best film of 2019. Black and bleak as can be, superb acting and cinematography."
1321,See title.Where do I begin. This is one of the best films of the year. I can see several awards being chucked this films way. I saw it 4 times already and plan to watch again digitally over the break.
1322,Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar. A must watch movie for DC fans which superbly relates to the batman series. The evolution of joker.
1323,"From watching Wonder Woman and Aquaman followed by the awful Justice League, I was put off watching anything that came from the DC comics...When this came out I was reluctant to watch this... What pushed me to give it a go was the hype and I have to say, I am glad I took the risk..It paid offThis movie is not like any other comic book movie, it's more of a dark psychological thriller. The acting was first class, great performances by Joaquin Pheonix and Robert DeNiro ....
The ending was disturbing and yet comical at the same time"
1324,Why did we love this movie? Because he is showing dark side of the people.
1325,"My only problem with this superb retelling of the Joker origin...is that it was about the Joker. While it may have added a dimension and an audience the film would not have had otherwise, it really could have been a film about anyone. I actually felt the Bruce Wayne story line was the worst part of the film.A very dark and grittier idea reminiscent of ""Falling Down"", Joker has Arthur mugged, fired from his job and beat up by drunk guys. As the theory goes, if Arthur was mugged, beat up but NOT fired - would he be the Joker? If he was fired but NOT mugged or beat up - would he be the Joker? What sequence would have a different out come?The psychology and thought provocation in this film is the uncredited co-star along side Joaquin's Arthur Fleck."
1326,"Joaquin deserves an Oscar for this amazing role he played.
Ik really liked the movie a lot. I hope you deel more movies like this in the future.
It has been two days and I'm still thinking about how good it was"
1327,"I loved this movie. The director took on a huge challenge. Showing the true life of The Joker. I laughed, i cried, and really enjoyed seeing the movie. Origin stories are the best."
1328,"The Joker is a hard watch. It has disturbing scenes. However, it is a really good film. The directing is amazing, Alfred is cast and acted brillinatly, and it all comes together to a film that is really worth watching. I can understand why someone wouldnt like it, as it is quite a gruesome film, and if you are expecting a typical DC/ superhero film with loads of action, this is definitely not for you.
The development of Alfred as a character is amazing, seeing him turn on the system that has left him behind."
1329,"Tragedy either brakes a man or makes a man. But the Joker's Breakdown is more than mere tragedy. At a specific point in the story, it's a conscience choice. It's when he makes that free choice that the viewer no longer feels bad for him. When you change your philosophy to match how you feel (in the case of the Joker, to make morality subjective) you attack what makes human dignity objectively good. An opponent to human dignity is not subject to sympathy. The Joker is evil.
This is a commentary on the ""victim mindset"" that we see in today's political-correctness. Batman is the contrast. His hardships make him want to spread justice. The joker's hardships make him want to spread more hardships."
1330,"As one falls, another rises. The more I think about the movie, the less I have to say. This review was very difficult to write since I'd constantly get overwhelmed and lost in my thoughts. This film makes you think. A lot. It's the only thing I can think about and I can confidently say; it has 'scarred me'. The message it tells is relevant and very important since it's a realistic interpretation of where our society could end up. It's a warning which needs to be heard. Phillips makes an Oscar worthy, unique film. A film usually has high and low points which it fluctuates about. However, this film is steadily in the middle, creating tension throughout. Phillips makes the film fascinating and intriguing even though it's slow. The arc of Arthur is also organic and very well written since by the end you feel as if it was bound to happen. Phoenix's performance is also Oscar worthy since he is able to make us pity but fear him. Basically he's amazing. I'm still overwhelmed and trying to piece things together so that's all I have to say. In conclusion, it wouldn't be a surprise if it got a best picture and actor nomination. It's amazing and definitely one of my favorite films of all time."
1331,Creative writing about a mental disease plus traumatic life stress how will lead to such a unexpected overreaction and revenge.
1332,"I saw it today and i think this is one of the best films ever made. The storyline, the plot it was all amazingly made. Joaquin really did an amazing job."
1333,"A real, raw and painfully guileless performance by Joaquin Phoenix contrasts with the captivating theatrics of Heath Ledger, and while the late actor achieved a beautiful onscreen presence, Phoenix delivers a new, memorably intimate take on the Joker.The story itself detaches from the usual comic book shenanigans and takes a serious, melodramatic route, which pointedly negates the black-and-white nature of good and evil. It's always tricky to try to garner sympathy for a villain by drawing on the tragedies in their past, but I think Joker safely accomplishes this, leaving us all conflicted. Some questions are answered in ways that leave the viewer unsatisfied and suspicious - a clever tactic to make each of us decide who we choose to believe.The direction and cinematography make this a captivating experience. Sudden events will elicit an awkward smile, while the rest is simply portentous and tragic."
1334,"Amazing acting, great storyline and keeps you wanting more. I've not been to the cinema for 10 years and Joker was worthy of the visit. Can't recommend this movie enough. Will the making of the riddler be the next movie?"
1335,"It actually isn't, but the way the character was being developed, it could be a true story.I watched Joker last night and to be honest, I am with Joker on this one. The way he was treated by a truly demented society with no support, he had two options, either shoot himself (option 1), or shoot someone else (option 2).The Joker accurately depicts the way low-income people are being treated, when an underlying and benign mental health issue is not treated.Phoenix is the Joker; the way a good and sensitive man becomes the personification of chaos is truly remarkable and magnificent....and in my opinion very real!"
1336,"It's astounding that something so closely resembling a piece of art, doesn't do so at the expense of being entertaining, edge of your seat cinema. There are millions of things for movie buffs and cinephiles alike to drool about and for your everyday movie goer, you'll be enraptured from start to finish.
This was a generation defining film. It was as close to perfect as a film can be."
1337,"After seeing this movie and all the negatives buzz it was getting it made me believe that critics are Worthless.They have lost all of my trust and who the hell though this is gonna Inspires anyone in a negative way, but it has inspired people in a position way because it talks bout serious issues Like childhood trauma,mental illness.this movie has spread an awareness toward these people bout what pain they are suffering from."
1338,An amazing & fascinating maserpiece of Both todd philips as director phoenix as casting
1339,"As a fan of Phoenix i was eagerly anticipating a stand out performance despite the disparaging comments about the bad protrayal of mental health issues...and i wasn't dissapointed. I cannot imagine a better actor to portray the Joker and the level of violence, whilst expected , wasn't in my opinion overdone. Not usually a fan of comic book movies...i am now decidedly more on board."
1340,"I never write a review of the movie until today. This is the perfect roll for Joaquin
Phoenix, and i think it's because he didn't have to act too much. I must say that this movie made me look for all his rolls and is his one of the kind actor that he is highly underrated. This performance doesn't deserve number in grades, it desreve respect .But the real winner of this story is Todd Phillips, ( I bet he knoe what Joaquin can pool off, and he sow it right from the beginning), because it was a complicated story that only Joaquin could pull off; I really don't see another actor can make this role. And we can all wonder how many Joker DNA we have inside of ourselves, how much we become slaves to this system that can cannot import slaves anymore but they are sure that we are all be productive like they was before."
1341,"Absolutely awesome. Best comic film since The Dark Knight Trilogy, Joaquin's performance is simply perfect. Direction and soundtrack fit perfectly and storyline is well executed and well thought out."
1342,"Most movies that generate controversy come and go with little fanfare. Usually because they are not particularly good and therefore are tossed into the news cycle and disappeared abruptly and usually deservedly. There was that Seth Rogen movie about assassinating the Chinese dictator (never saw it), the 'Human Centipede' franchise that attempts to offend everybody (never will see it), and who can forget the conservative gasp over the American flag raising being left out of 'First Man' (saw it..meh). The problem with 'Joker' is it is good.
No, it's great. And unless you are prepared to deal with the guilt, misplaced or otherwise, over your enjoyment of it, then you should skip it because Phoenix will seduced you with his performance. Is it wrong given the times we live in? Oh, yes. That's what makes it so amazing. It is impossible to dismiss the fact that this is simply a shockingly brilliant performance. And director Todd Philips offers up nothing to reassure the audience that this is ""just a movie"". There is no gimmick or troupe, ""super"" or otherwise, to remind us that this is a comic book universe. There is no room for Affleck's 'Batman' in this Gotham. It is deliberately as unpreposterous a world that appears to be, tragically, not much removed from our own. There are flaws to the film to be sure (DeNiro is distractingly miscast, and 'Thomas Wayne' is unsympathetically Trumpesque) and there is an argument to be made that we have seen this indepth character study in madness done before (check out Harry Treadaway in 'Mr. Mercedes'). None of that matters. Rest assured 'Joker' won't take home any Oscars. It's too sinister for the times we find ourselves in. As for Phoenix, his performance demands a whole new category that surpasses ""best actor"". But it will have to do."
1343,Joaquin Phoenix exceeded with this performance. Never felt so uncomfortable watching someone perform. Yes I felt bad for him but there was a darkness in his eyes that stopped me from doing that too often.
1344,"Everyone will appreciate this film, but only a select few will relate to it entirely. As someone who has deeply suffered with social isolation and severe depression, this is the only film in existence that had me crying my eyes out to the point of a near panic attack. My emotions were so high throughout the whole movie I could hardly pay attention to what was going on. Anyone who has ever felt emptiness so deep that you feel completely hollow, wanting to just give up entirely, wondering how it's so easy for everyone else, please be warned. You should not view this movie if you have any recent depressive episodes. This film brought me back to being a teenager, so angry with the society that rejected me, frustrated with those that would never understand themselves as being an involuntary contributor. As I was watching Joaquin Phoneix hit the threshold few of us have approached, watching his psyche crack and his spirit break, the audience around me was laughing at his superficially ""silly"" behavior. This admittedly made my blood boil to the point that I half wanted to lash out at their clear ambivalent ignorance, similarly to the path of the Joker. I'm partially worried for less stable people's potential reaction to this stunning performance. However hope this will help the general public who have not suffered with mental health, better understand what causes people to ""abruptly"" become ""crazy"". I spent an hour crying in my car afterwards, remembering how it felt to give up and just isolate myself instead, crawling into a dark hole. I can honestly say I have never related to a performance to this extent. The character development was nothing short of a masterpiece."
1345,"'Joker' is a brilliantly crafted film that tugs at the heart strings at Arthur Fleck's misfortune.
The score, cinematography, production design, Joaquin Phoenix and the meaning is all brilliant.
I can't help but follow and understand Arthur through this haunted journey.
The most powerful moment has to be the blood smile. Symbolising the death of Arthur and rise of the Joker. The score as it's happening is just so riveting.
His laugh has more meaning than ever, a fantastic new take on the Joker's laugh, where it's seen as a mentally ill thing.
I love Joker because of how different it is compared to the majority of Comic Book Movies.
Dark, not much humour (I don't really humour mind being in CBM)
It's just so different from Marvel because of how repetitive they are.
Todd Phillips, thank you for bringing my favourite character back to life again.
Phoenix better win an Oscar. He absolutely deserves this."
1346,I haven't went to the movies in 3 years. I went for this one. One of the best movies & performances I've ever seen. Hands down.
1347,"I saw very praising reviews and some of my friends said it's masterpiece. Some said it's very boring. But I think it is something between it.Definitely not a boring movie, but I think there could be done something more. But acting was really impressive.P.S. I am here with update. One day passed, and I am still thinking about the Joker. Rewatched trailer. I wish movie was little bit better though, and I understand that movie is good mostly because of Joaquin Phoenix. Wish it were focused more on what he's done than on how hurt he was. Mostly it's bad when a movie is too long, but here I wish there were extra 20-30 minutes to fill the story. Sorry for my english."
1348,"Joker it's a great movie with an outstanding Phoenix performance that took me trough the building of one of the most famous villains in the world: ""the joker, el guason, el bromas"" or whatever you want to call him is an icon of insanity and chaos.But the movie is a lot more than just the Arthur Fleck character devolpment that lead him into purpose (joker), it's about mental illness, it's about society failing to provide help to the people that are in need of assistance, it's about social disadvantage, and it is filmed beautifully with a pleasant pace.The comparisons are only a consequence of two great performances, some will prefer Ledger some will choose Phoenix or even Nicholson or Romero, but I value the challenge that both Phoenix and Todd Phillips took making this movie, the moment they decide to make it true they knew it could go side ways like the Jared Leto role, or they could make a really great film that put us all to chose in between brilliant Jokers.For me I liked Ledger more as the joker but again this movie was about Arthur Fleck and it will be hard to present a better Arthur that one in this movie.As the Joker when he embraces his insanity I missed some of the Leadger greatness and that's why it's not a 10/10 for me, but overall I loved the outstanding approach, acting and movie."
1349,"Even if I didn't love the character that is the Joker, I would still love this movie.
Just came out from the cinema, and what is there to complain about? Nothing.Brilliant scenery, superb acting.
The way they cut the trailers was fantastic in relationship to the actual movie.
Just watch it!"
1350,It's so good. I actually cried. Mental health or really most health is ignored in the US. He wasn't a psychopath seeking attention he just didn't know what was wrong. I have an adhd daughter and she has moments where she doesn't understand what is wrong. This version of the Joker was the best.
1351,"I do not like super hero movies. Fortunately, this is not one. This is an incredibly disturbing character study of a man who happens to appear in comic books and other movies. This man is different than all of those other men. This man has nothing to do with those other men. It is not necessary to compare Arthur Fleck to the Joker of the Dark Knight. This is not about that joker. Arthur Fleck does not become that Joker.This is the story of a mentally ill man who becomes an accidental icon. It is not a negative statement against mental illness. It is a look at one mentally ill man. It is not in any way saying that all mentally ill people become homocidal maniacs. Arthur Fleck just happens to become one.Joaquin Phoenix gives an excellent interpretation of a very creative script. He is not trying to play ""the Joker"". He is trying to tell the truth of one mans life, and he succeeds. It is very disturbing to watch. It's more disturbing to sit with the thoughts you will have about yourself and about society while Arthur's story unfolds. I was also disturbed by the audience around me, and also by myself, laughing at dark moments in this mans life. This movie holds a mirror to society and it's hard to ignore the image you see reflected before your eyes. Go see it, it's worth it."
1352,"A lanky Caucasian man, sitting in front of a make-up table painting his face white. Through his pondering eyes rolls a tear, smudging his mascara, while he pulls his mouth wide as if forcing a smile. Meet Arthur Fleck, a 30-something impoverished party-clown who's still mentally recuperating after years in the asylum.With a neurological disorder of uncontrollable laughter citing his traumatic childhood, Fleck struggles every day to make ends meet with futile attempts to tackle bullying in public and taking care of a delusional mother at home. Set in the 80's Gotham, where a worker's strike lead to city-wide garbage congestion and thus, rise in the anti-establishment views at large. Both of the above circumstances foreshadow the inevitable.
And then, a cataclysmic event by a desperate act of self-defence pushes our helpless clown over the edge. We see Fleck in makeup breaking into a slow-ballet and sashay to his music, wrapped in a calming trance of his own inner turmoil. We know it then, for sure, that our villain has arrived.Having said so, JOKER doesn't overcook the rhymes and reasons but is a textbook on the anatomy of a psychopath. It is well-structured, moderately paced with a compelling character-origin story. Director Todd Phillips and cinematographer Lawrence Sher (""The Hangover"", ""War Dogs"") create an enigma of sorts amidst tight close-ups over the ominous grave themes in cello by upcoming composer Hildur Guðnadóttir (""Chernobyl"") - all in a harmony. They make Fleck's circumstantial actions seem so justified that it's hard not to feel for him - even when he does things because he can.Been spoken about those influential comparisons with prior inspirations, such as - ""The Man Who Laughs"" (a 1928 Victor Hugo novel's adaptation), or ""King of Comedy"" (Martin Scorsese's 1983 dark-comedy, also starring De Niro, who plays a pivotal role here); the one with Jack Nicholson (1989) or, the most remembered ""THE Heath Ledger's portrayal"" (Christopher Nolan's 2008 ""The Dark Knight"") - all seem justified. However, just like the latter did for 'Batman', this film does for the psychotic super-villain - viz. ""to make it incredibly more human"".And, who else could have done it better than Joaquin Phoenix? Much like some previous performances - ""Walk the Line"", ""Her"" - his portrayal is rhythmically alarming, comical, self-driven and empathetic that it wouldn't be an exaggeration to call it among the finest screen-acting in the last few decades. Embodying Arthur Fleck and his personality's grim deterioration are imploring enough to search for something personal in those exhausting cackles, painful failures and delusions of grandeur, humiliations, the agony of being overlooked and stepped-over. Hence, it feels triumphant when the retaliation comes through a cacophony of riots as the Joker rises with a wide smile, unforced and natural this time.So, until we have reservations with the portrayal of mental illness and violence on-screen, please don't miss this rare gem of a psychological-drama. We may have the last laugh with this one.Hypnotic and near brilliant!
(8.75/10)"
1353,Cinematic masterpiece that may become close to Heath's extraordinary performance
1354,"It's really that good, near perfect film. It wonderfully explores the complexities of mental illness & society's obligation to the individual in terms of care. Then delves into the socioeconomic divide in America & how it impacts lives. This movie has an R rating so I don't get the backlash against the violence. American history is filled with violence & movies from the seventies were way more violent & filled with more harsh adult themes than this film. Joaquin Phoenix does a riveting job of portraying a believable character, who is as much a product of society as society is of his world due to the harm he inflicts. A classic example of art imitating life. The director, Todd Phillips, brings grit to the camera as well as a marvelous score that is ominous as well as sets the metamorphosis of Joker. Definitely one of the best ""comic book "" films of all time. So much closer to the ""Killing Joke"" graphic novel than the animated movie."
1355,"I've been waiting for this film for a while. After the sound check for this movie from Todd Phillip's Instagram that came out almost a year ago, I've been so pumped for Joker ever since. I watched this film 2 days ago, and I gotta say, this is the best film I've seen in a movie theater by a long shot. Let's start with the obvious, Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker is definitely one of the best performances of the decade, and possibly in my top 10 favorite performances of all time. Joaquin was haunting in this film, his smile, his laugh, and his actions all feel so real and terrifying. Also, I really feel connected and understand his character even though he's doing all of these bad things. Todd Phillips did a really good job with the direction in this film. Another great thing about this film is its cinematography. This film's colors bounce off the screen and every shot in the film felt so in my face I loved it. I saw it in Dolby Cinema, and the experience was dazzling. The film made me feel like I was right there with the characters. Let's talk about Heath Ledger's joker versus Joaquin Phoenix's joker. Ledger's joker was on screen in The Dark Knight for about 50 minutes, and he sells every second of it. Although, there was almost no arc for Heath's joker and I didn't connect with him unlike Joaquin's joker. I feel like Heath's joker is a better performance, but Joaquin's joker felt more like a person that I could connect and understand more. If Joaquin doesn't win Best Actor I'm gonna hate the academy forever. My only issue with the film, which is kinda major, is its similarities to Taxi Driver. This film takes many aspects from Taxi Driver like many other films, but Joker especially. There were some moments in this film that were a lot like some moments in Taxi Driver. The first act of this film felt familiar, but the second and third act of this film really hits home. I'm gonna keep this brief, but there are a few subplots in this film that are a bit ballsy, that has never been expressed in any form of a joker comic or film or tv show. Some might find these subplots weird, but I find them pretty compelling and is one of the most unique parts of this film. People have been saying that this film is violent and some have even said that this film is ""dangerous."" I disagree with those statements highly because this film isn't too violent, and the violent parts are shown in a really raw and realistic way, not being hollywoodized violence. There are way more violent films in my opinion that people have forgotten about, like almost every single Tarantino film, or Drive, and heck, even Taxi Driver. People are just saying these exaggerated things to get attention, and that really ticks me off. This was probably one of my most anticipated films of all time, and it did not disappoint. I like how 2 of my most anticipated films come out in the same week, Joker and El Camino lol. Look out for my El Camino review coming out soon. I'm gonna give Joker a 9/10."
1356,"All I have to say is that Joker is so well written, so well paced and SO real that I now feel at ease on why and how I have seen the world for so many yearsSuddenly I don't feel guilty for seeing the world as a cynical, cruel and dark place to live (and why being good to others is so inportant)Suddenly the walls I built to live and survive in this world finally make senseKudos to Todd Phillips and kudos to JokerA must see for all adults and adults to be"
1357,"This was an intriguing examination of mental disorder and its causes. I believe that the movie was distinct with its direction of the storytelling from the get go, and I am glad that the film managed to handle the complex ambience. The character development of the Joker was well-choreographed by the phenomenal performance from Joaquin Phoenix, which was also accompanied by Todd Philips' balanced production.However, there were some plot points that felt like it was not fitting the film. Especially the storyline that connects Arthur and the Wayne family did not work out. The concept of relating the origin of both character is not really new (considering Tim burton's 1989 batman) and it was not even laid out properly in the film. I think the movie took full advantage of the fact that the character joker represents a dubious background, which at some point raises questions toward the causality that surrounds Arthur. The whole effort to tie this film with batman universe felt unnecessary, and to some degree it disturbed the identity of the film.Social commentaries were made regarding the movie; the film was said to be dangerous for its alleged romanticization of the violence that roots from the suppressed individuals. I disagree. The film did not glorify the route Arthur takes. Rather, the story was a depiction of the event that would likely to happen in a similar kinds of situation. The disturbance comes from its rawness, and the awareness originates from the disturbance. I admire Todd for not shying away from presenting every aspect of a human who has reached the rock bottom. That way this film portraits not only the joker inside of the movie screen, but also the ""jokers"" outside of the movie screen.Overall the theme were nicely put, was projected in a form of Joaquin's exceptional acting, but the storyline had some unnecessary weight on it.+Numerous symbolisms in the movie were extremely vivid, but the one that impressed me the most was the hospital scene in general. As Arthur dances in the hospital room filled with children, the movie accompanies the scene with a nursery rhyme ""If you're happy and you know it."" The lyric sings to stomp the feet if you are happy as Arthur stomps his feet vigorously (the movie emphasizes the movement quite a lot). Because of his excessive moves he accidentally drops a gun, which later becomes the very first event that triggers Arthur's development as a joker. The action of him trying to show the audience that he is happy results Arthur to reveal his gun, which I think is a metaphor of his vile instinct inside him. This interpretation could be along the line of over-analyzation, but to me at least it was an interesting component."
1358,"The beginning of this movie is quite slow, so one star fell for that. The plot is pleasantly easy to follow probably because of really goddamn great editing. Casting could not be chosen better, but Joaquin Phoenix was a spot on choice for the main role, and just amazing job he did channeling all the feelings, mental illness and tiredness of Joker to the audience - all of it mostly just by the gaze in his eyes. Soundtracks are very _very_ well chosen to fit a scene. Not too much action, but all the action scenes are sudden, surprising and gory enough to make one cringe. Must say that this movie is one of my personal favorites."
1359,"This has been a much talked about film and for me being a huge fan of The Joker I had so much interest in this fim and it has been controversial but I really loved it. The premise of the film sees a man with mental issues dealing with his life as he becomes more and more twisted and morphs into the supervillain The Joker. Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck in this film and I mean he has to be the favourite for the oscar next year. You feel every emotion watching this character and you are mesmerized when you watch his character on screen, I don't want to say too much about his character in this film as you should experience it without knowing too much. The question will become who was the better Joker Joaquin Phoenix or Heath Ledger and I have to be honest they are so different that I am so happy we have both performances to appreciate. Robert De Niro plays a show host in this film and it was just really nice to see De Niro give a great performance and seem like he actually cared about his role . I thought the guy the played Thomas Wayne also did a really good job in his smaller role and I felt he fit the character very well. however, my one critique for the film is some of the female supporting characters such as his mother and Zazzie Beetz characters aren't given the depth that the other characters have in the film and that was slightly dissapointing. The story is great seeing this individual go through their life and develop into this character, I can't say much about the story as you need to experience it for itself and make your own assessment. The script is fantastic, a brilliant mix of humour and drama that makes this an incredibly interesting film with a great lead performance. The style makes this film seem based in a somewhat reality and that makes it even more terrifying, yest there are some uncomfortable scenes but thye feel appropriate for the film that it being shown. Overall this is a truly fantastic character film that if you are a fan of character development then this is a film for you."
1360,Best joker ever everthing was perfect from A to Z story was ture the act was true and soundtrack oooooo that was a thing
1361,"Joker is a character study type comic book film different from comic-flicks of those days. It is one of the best and realistic movie I ever seen. It shows every aspects of a man's life and it's struggles. Also the violence was higher than anticipated. Arthur killing 3 men in subway, his mother and Murray on the show was quite disturbing. His story keeps an emotion within ur heart. Also Phoenix's performance is at ledger's level making it absolute and film of the year. Still the ending shows the bloody smile that joker will laugh when he shall bring this movies to Oscar."
1362,"Incredible outstanding chapeau bas total respect to the actor , oscar for sure if no so RIP hollywood .....
One of the best film this year , NO!!! I mean one of the best film ever .....
I hope i can go by time and watch it again and agian and again....."
1363,"The film will remind you very much of taxi driver and the king of comedy. Joaquin Phoenix did a fantastic job. He was one of the most scariest characters I have seen in years. The film is violent and does glorify it to an extent, however this should not be condemned since it'sa creative direction, and it's a movie based on a comic book villain, so it should be expected. Phenomenal cinematography and great soundtrack to go with it."
1364,"Got nothing to say but , he deserves the that 10 review the acting was on point the production was on point Thanks to all whomever involved in producing this great movie to us .... Thanks for the hardwork"
1365,"Mesmerizing performance by the legendary Joaquin Phoenix is only one piece of a puzzle that makes this movie a must to watch. You simply cannot move your eyes away from him throughout the entire film and that's about 99.9 percent of the time he is on screen. Yes, he carries it on his own and everyone else is just a side character.
The screenplay and the brilliant direction Todd Phillips decides to take the film surpasses all the expectations of the viewer. When watching it, it's very difficult to predict what will happen in the next scene and that's what makes this film stand out from the bunch.
I don't remember the last time, I was asking that many questions after leaving the theater.
As a matter of fact, I am going to see the film again tonight to try to comprehend the complex nature of Arthur Fleck's mind and just to enjoy the brilliant cinematography."
1366,"Taking it as a whole since its chilling beginning to the groundbreaking Joker-worthy ending, this movie should be recognized as a movie you don't want a sequel to, but only wished it lasted forever. Joaquin's masterpiece acting should, throughout the upcoming decades, be described as one of the best, if not the very top, of what we've ever been able to witness."
1367,"After the longest time DC comes back with a bang to remind the world where the real story begins. Joker is simply a showcase of true brilliance of Todd Phillips and Joaquin illustrating the roots of a madman. The concept of one bad day which could happen to anyone has been so well portrayed that it's truly a treat for anyone who sits through the cinematic experience of a lifetime. Regardless of the timelines Joaquin has outdone himself to bring life to a character which many felt was irreplaceable after the performance of the great Heath Ledger.Joaquin's joker is a reminder to all Batman fans who have watched through the decades, of Mark Richard Hamill and the insane joker that he has given us back in the 90's. In comparison to the joker which we see in this movie is a crazy psychopath in the making as compared to the schizophrenic joker that Heath Ledger plays in the Dark Knight.Both jokers have done justice to the character and probably the most dreaded villian of the Batman. The transition of the joker is worth every single second of this movie, and I could bet that you wouldn't want the movie to end when it ends."
1368,This movie is a study on mental illness. It brings awareness about problems in society. Not giving anything else away. You'd have to see it to believe it. Joaquin Phoenix exceeded my expectations. His Joker has surpassed Heath Ledger's version in my opinion.
1369,"People should go and see it I think was a master piece I honestly believe that. The acting, the picture, the scenes. I haven't seen anything so disturbing in a long long time. After 30 minutes I was so uncomfortable but at the same time so curious to see what it is going to happen .When I say is disturbing is because it is real, It is not the same Batman films with explosions and unreal mystic powers magic or anything like that. After watching this film you will be more careful about people any people, because mental illness is real and you never know when you will find a psychopath , he or she can be sit next to you. It is a journey how a sick society can destroy humans. BTW the trailers shows nothing about the real film."
1370,"Joker (2019)9.5/10🤡🎭💄""Dark, violent and so full of truth, Joker takes a new approach on the backstory trope, creating a very grand accomplishment of a film that will go down as one of the greats of all time.""The societal factors that surround us are what shape the everyday lives of any man or woman that walks the ground of the earth. Joker just so happens to be glorius yet horrifyingly realistic depiticion of the various ""what ifs"" in our dysfunctional world. Granted, this film is a origin story of one of the most beloved antagonists in cinema and comic book history, however, the film also holds a very vital meaning in its delivery. With the help of a Joaquin Phoenix career defining performance, we are able to see the slow dip into insanity of the average man who'd be the least expected to morph into a monstrous villain by the hand of society, caused by neglection. Todd Phillips is a damn genius, and again proves to us that a comedic mind can also hold the most grim ideas. He most certainly proves this by delivering the fun additives, which would be the clever use of violence that is more artsy than controversial (people exaggerate so much it sickens me), a discomforting atmosphere that leaves you feeling the anxiety you never knew you could feel; like watching Taxi Driver times 5, and an ending that you never knew a third act could pull off so masterfully, it becomes more unforgettable than one could imagine. Joker has easily, and most effortlessly, claimed the throne of Movie of the Year.Verdict: Joker is the masterpiece we all knew it would be. Even if the Clown Prince of Crime isn't your cup of tea, I suggest watching this movie anyways because it's not just a movie, it's a reality."
1371,"A mentals life described in a film, that should've been renamed as an masterpiece"
1372,Best Joker centered film I have ever seen in my life. Everything about this movie was absolute perfection. I can't think of a single reason why I would take off even 1 point from the perfect 10 that this movie deserves. Brilliant!!! I would watch this again and again and again. This will become a cult classic and will be raved about for years to come. Mark my words.
1373,"The best performance I've seen from an individual actor combined with some of the best cinematography I've ever seen also. So perfectly dark, sinister and crazy! I doubt there will ever be a more perfect joker in any film of this doesn't win multiple oscars it will be a travesty."
1374,"Unbelievable 10/10, Joaquin Phoenix's performance was so intense and uncomfortable, keeping me on the edge of my seat"
1375,"""A gritty character study of Arthur Fleck, a man disregarded by society"" is IMDB's excellent byline description of this deep exploration of disintegrating (disintegrated?) mental health.It's described as taking place in the 'Scorseseverse' by some critics, in that Phoenix's performance as Arthur Fleck appears to be an homage to many of Scorsese's monumental 70's characters. And what's more, De Niro has a supporting role that shows he still can deliver the goods when not just taking a part for the money.So I've already used the M word and in this Academy Award winning performance (of that there is no doubt) Joaquim Phoenix's monumental performance will put the Academy back on track after their laughable decision to recognise Rami Malek for impersonating Freddie Mercury last year.I detest impersonation movies on the whole, but this is no impersonation, this is a character crafted out of magic. It's not a superhero movie in the slightest and all the better for it. It's simply a character study of great depth and extreme nuance.One thing I loved about this intense study of a disintegrating man is the extreme close ups that shows Phoenix in all his imperfections, his upper lip, his wonky teeth, his chewed finger nails, his nicotine stained fingers (possibly make-up). It's glorious.It is unquestionably a masterpiece, not just for Phoenix's performance, but for every SINGLE aspect of cinema: music (White Room by Cream blasts out of the screen in the final apocalyptic act to tremendous effect - but it's outstanding throughout), make-up (stunning), costume (stunning), cinematography (stunning - the dance on the steps and the aerial train track shot particularly blew me away), design (epic) and direction (Todd Phillips follows up his epic production, but not direction, of A Star Is Born remarkably It's interesting looking at Todd Phillips' Filmography though - a real mixed bag with much of it centred on comedy - The Hangover in particular.)But you don't need me to tell you how good this movie is - you don't get a 9.1 rating on IMDB without reason.See it and bathe in its mastery."
1376,Joker is a brilliant piece of film making and an instant classic it will be spoke about for years to come and is officially my favourite film and will be watching it more and more as the years go by and carry on getting mesmerised by the great performances score and choreography in this gritty character study 10/10
1377,He is an absolute legend in this film. He deserves all the praise in the world for this chilling performance. The movie itself is not only just a great comic book but a great movie in general. This is a movie that is going to change comic book films for the next 10 years. And I stand by that statementFinal rating: 9.2/10
1378,This movie left me speechless. It is a true visual and musical masterpiece with flawless acting. Amazing.
1379,It's a cult movie for joker fans ......climax made me standing ovation man..you can't skip this movie at all....movie has too much depth about humans I don't tell more watch the movie please
1380,"This movie, this actor and overall execution was superb.Illness of the society is impecable pictured. This movie should be discussed to Annalise the cancer of our modern society"
1381,If your a Batman fan you'll love this movie. If your not a fan you will still love this movie. This movie was a very dark take on how the joker came too. Very well done.
1382,"This is a poor attempt to use the comic books to sell a rip off of Taxi Driver, the movie strays too far from the comics and smacks of trying too hard to get awards. It has no relevance to the comics other than a few names and set in Gotham and tries too hard to be the type of movie that will get nominations for awards. This is no criticism of the actors by the way, I actually thought they did a good job with what they were given but the movie just wasn't good, it dragged and felt longer than it was. There are much better DC movies out there and better versions of the Joker too."
1383,"The clueless scriptwriter, director and cast are oblivious to the concept of The Joker. Clowns are the slapstick, predictable fools who do stupid things to entertain small, childlike minds. This is a story that fits nowhere and merely provides two hours of tedious boredom.
The thin plot is uninteresting, the characters are dull and the entire thing could be played out, without losing a molecule of content, within fifteen minutes.
I was annoyed that it was this bad, given the enthusiastic reviews - but I can't say I was surprised. So much poor film-making gets a rave response that that the positive reviews simply mean lots of jaded or thhughtless people liked it. That's no indication of its quality, sadly.
Oh well, another two hours of watching mediocrity mixed with boredom just so that I can appreciate a good movie when one turns up."
1384,"The origins of a Monster.If you see one film this year, please see The Joker. It does seem that we are getting constant remakes and origins films, but this is remarkable, I think people are fed up of both mentioned categories because many of the movies we're presented with haven't come up to scratch. The Joker however is phenomenal, the best film I've seen in the cinema for quite some time. I was enthralled from start to finish. The story is fantastic, the writing thoughtful and intelligent.Joaquin Phoenix, what can you say, it's a master class performance from him, he injects everything needed into the part, to make it chilling, sad and menacing. No wonder the awards are flowing.I genuinely cannot remember the last time I left a cinema feeling so rewarded by a film.Incredible. 10/10"
1385,"Joker was AMAZING!! I was so blown away at how accurate they portrayed mental illness and the background that caused it all. Everyone is battling something we know nothing about. Be nice. Joaquin Phoenix is amazing in this role!! I was sad everytime he laughed though... Plot twists give the Batman universe a tragic, completely believable origin. I also like how the pacing went from slow to chaotic throughout the movie! The aesthetic is dark and beautiful at the same time, and I wish the next batman movie will have the same atmosphere!"
1386,"Astonishing acting and directing, mind exploding scenes and heartbreaking moments that makes you laugh and cry at the same time. Just bravo"
1387,"Acting of mr.Phoenix was good. But the movie had no story.
No story
Nothing from comics
Bipolar disorder can't really lead to become boss.of Gotham underground.
Very boring"
1388,"An awful lot has been talked about this film even before it hit cinemas. From the triumphs at the film festivals to the backlash surrounding the subject matter of the film. There hasn't been a film in quiet like it in some time that has brought up such emotion/controversy in the public eye. Not gonna lie I was anticipating this film as soon as it was announced...........it was really fascinating to me as to why on earth Warner Bros. thought that audiences needed/wanted a Joker ""solo/origin"" film. There had to be something special about it........................my god is there something special about this film. It is truly unique not just as a comic book film but just as a film. Its more a psychological thriller than a comic book film.Joaquin Phoenix is a fantastic actor no-one can take that away from him, even before witnessing his performance in this film, the man is a truly great actor anyway. Wow just wow............I didn't think it was humanly possible that anyone could embody the character of the ""Joker"" quiet like Heath Ledger did over a decade ago....but wow does Phoenix come very very close. (I know you shouldn't compare......because its not fair on either performance...........there both fantastic in there own right). Phoenix's character Arthur Fleck is pretty much your every day person at the start, however its witnessing the terrible decline in one mans journey that is truly horrifying. I'm gonna say it he deserves at least an Oscar nomination...if not more. Takes your breath away.There are so many story elements to this film that just hit the nail right on the head, firstly the misdirection of Thomas Wayne being Arthur Flecks father is fantastic.....a really interesting angle however it is quickly super-seeded by the fact that Flecks mother was mentally unwell and made the whole thing up.....also whilst in the process uncovering that Fleck was adopted. His complete hallucination of Zazie Beetz character being involved with him, is done so so well, it only dawns on you at the final moment that it was a figment of his imagination........the figment being a really normal life. Mind blown!!!!!!!!!! All of which has such emotion and punch especially on Arthur........who is unwell, but that is slightly put upon him by the society that he inhabits. The culture of isolationism within Gotham City only fuels the fire raging inside Fleck waiting for the right moment to appear.......and boy it does.On to the controversy surrounding the film. My own personally opinion, anyone reading this is perfectly entitled to disagree, there is no controversy with this film at all. I believe the reason for people feeling uncomfortable with this film is because it shows a true representation of what would happen to a man like this.......and more importantly that it could happen in real life today. With the society we live in today in 2019, it is plausible what happens on screen could become reality to a certain degree. Thats the part, I think, that horrifies people. Its definitely not glorifying violence, this is not a tremendously violent film...it has its moments here and there. There are plenty more violent films that have been made and are going to be made. What this film does glorify is the stigma attached to class status and mental health illnesses, however its trying to open your eyes. The film is trying to make you look in the mirror and show you that this is our society really, that Gotham City and Arthur Fleck could be replaced by anyone and anywhere if we don't look at these societal problems. Thats what I think anyway.Final positive the score is out of this world. I know this sounds very snobby thing to say but the score really does inhabit an added character to the film........it is truly horrifying. Oscar nod 100%.Overall this film is great....I definitely need to see it again, it needs a deserves a second viewing to really understand and appreciate everything. 85% out of 100 or 8.5 out of 10. Fantastic, real eye opening story, mind blowing performance from Joaquin Phoenix. Must also mention great directing from Todd Phillips.......the guy that did ""The Hangover"" did this.........wow. Even if your not a comic book film fan you must see this because this is least comic-booky film your ever going to see, ""King of Comedy"" meets ""Taxi Driver""."
1389,I love the 60's. Do I have to tell you more? This movie? Pure madness...
1390,"I went into this movie without watching trailers or hearing gossip about it. I wanted to see this rendition with a clear mind and appreciate it. Unfortunately, no amount of open mindedness could prepare me for the insane boredom that was this film. I have never in my life wanted to leave a movie because it was so bad. It drug on and on for what seemed like 4 hours and I was ready to go after the first 30 minutes. The one and only reason I stayed was because I did not buy the ticket, it was a gift.
But hey, everyone likes different things so if you enjoy comically long scenes with nothing but an insane man laughing or you really like movies that are a 100 on the boredom scale, then this is perfect for you!"
1391,"An anarchist, his falling apart life and a city on edge -- what else you need to make a gritty, dark and violent biography of one of the greatest villain of cinematic history.Todd Phillip's Joker ticks all the box when it comes to making an edgy and dark film like this. Splashing blood, outrageous deaths and a world which is crumbling apart. This film has everything. But the soul of this film is Joker himself. This rendition of Joker, very skillfully takes inspiration from all the past presentations and yet able to put a breath of fresh air on this legendary character.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is not just breathtaking but strangely satisfying. Playing Joker on screen is perhaps one of the toughest jobs an actor can have. People have high hopes. And after Ledger's performance, Phoenix had a big shoe to fill in. But he shines in this film. The ease with which Phoenix carries out the role, speaks volume about his acting callibre.About the other aspects of the film, the cinematography is on point. It very craftily captures the city from Joker's eyes. It shows his struggle and his making. The audience was very much used to watching Gotham from Batman's eyes, but perhaps for the first time, we as an audience has access to the other side of the narrative.Speaking of the other side, this film very successfully shows the class struggle we humans have to endure. Moreover it shows the cycle of hate and crime, which effects the Gotham City and also eventually the life of our own Bruce Wayne.This film is a must watch. Although it might not be the best DC film ever to come, but it certainly is a living tribute to probably the greatest and most nuanced character humans have ever created."
1392,"A Mental Sick Man Walks Into a Comedy Club. Jokers performance is great but the movie is just dodo, when I think of all the hype it got years before it was even released I have to say I am largely disapointed with the story.Also lets not mess with the Jokers origin story, that is just plain silly, I am calling this out now, if you liked this movie PLEASE call a mental health help line or seek help with a professional because the movie is one big mental illness that should never have seen the light of day."
1393,The depravity of this movie should be a concern to all parents. It's one thing for adults to make choices to see this type of degradation and evil. That which you put in your mind becomes part of your fabric. I still feel ill 24 hours after seeing it. This movie is just ugly. I would think there's enough ugly things happening every day in the news and the world to depress you without having to fill your mind with two hours of it voluntarily. Truly sad statement about our society and those who think this is art. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone. Pure nonsense and sick violence.
1394,"Worst two hours of my Saturday night.
Overloaded with sickness."
1395,"Joaquin Phoenix born to acting this character he's deserve an oscar for this amazing performance
Soundtracks was amazing, also the cinematography and the direction.
All of things in this movie were perfect."
1396,"JOKER character should have been much better presented in a more psycho-path life. Suffering like in the movie is not a good cause for such a character to rise. I expected a lot from a movie rated over 9, and really disappointed with it. We were 8 watching and 4 said not worth the ticket. Hoaquin did a great job, but the scenario and directing were poor."
1397,This movie was beyond disturbing. Zero redeeming qualities. I have no idea why anyone would make this movie. Our real world is so horrific we don't need fiction to make it worse.
1398,"Joker is anything but a masterpiece, although it certainly takes itself seriously enough and it tries harder than any movie in recent memory to be one (maybe the recent Star is Born tries harder). But I found it largely languorous, psychopathic in its intent and subsequent failure to move me on any level and, well, not worth even a laugh.I don't know what the point of this film is, since it doesn't really work as Batman lore, providing a shoddy psychological construct around the Joker's origins, and if the idea was to top either Nicholson or Ledger it failed me (Nolan's Joker vision is far more nihilistic, seemingly coming from nowhere, with a twisted, brutal sense of humor about him.) Here we are meant to empathize with poor disgruntled Arthur Fleck, which might have been easier had he not been fed so many obvious motivations for his disgruntlement, and propped up by such lazy writing.If Joker is meant to 'be a mirror' to our times, it fails again, to say anything relevant or novel about society, or about the US, or the mental health system or anything really that hasn't been said a million times before, and instead seems focused on taking itself really really seriously, and wants us to find sequences of the Joker dancing to Gary Glitter edgy and bombastic, when really these sequences are dull and incongruent deadweight.Fans will lambast the haters of this film, but frankly I was bored by its flat embrace of pointless amorality. I wanted better, more biting satire, more layers, more motivation. Instead we get superficial, ultra-violent and pointless dreck which says and means nothing, even while it looks swell, has a great cast and seemingly all the ingredients are in order. But maybe that's the trade off for giving the reigns of such a film to the Hangover director."
1399,"What an unforgettable experience this movie was.. the last movie i saw that had ""must experience"" all over it was ""A Quiet Place"".. if you ever saw that in the movies you'd know what I mean sitting there in a completely full theatre and yet you could hear a pin drop from the silence.. JOKER is right up there with the greatest movies of all-time with one of the greatest performances ever by Mr. Phoenix. Anyone else wins best actor and we know the ceremonies are rigged he was THAT good! Can't wait until this comes out in 4K not only is it insta-watch in the movies but it's also insta-grab to add to the collection! BRAVO!"
1400,Pure waste of time Pure waste of time Pure waste of time Pure waste of time
1401,There is nothing to excite and focus Inventory of a very ordinary film I wasted my time on him and also there are scenes adapted from the movie Batman and the Joker ... In killing the presenter ... less than expected level
1402,I need some time to gather what I just watched. This performance proves Mr. Pheonix is one of the greatest actors of our generation. Marvelous performance. A must see film.
1403,"The only good thing about this ""film"" was Joaquin's acting. Everything else is garbage."
1404,"If you like Movies with Zero Story and 2 Hours of bla bla nonsense, this is for you!This was by far the most boring Movie of 2019. An yeah, normally i Like the Joker, but what was that?
Sure i understand the Story about isolation and the Psychological Side.
But what makes this a Movie so special that it deserves a 8.8 Score?
Because of the Laughs from Joker? Because he shots some People?The Acting, sure was top notch, and the cinematography was wonderful.
But aside that, we have nothing remarkable. Only the Joker had a Character developement. All other Characters are boring sterotypes with not a single sidestory.3 Stars because of Acting and Cinematography... Nothing more."
1405,Boring. Didn't see why this 10 stars. Got board all he did was laugh haha.. So interesting.. 30 mins was all I could take. See ya...!
1406,"Joker is a drama movie in the vein of movies like Taxi-Driver and King of Comedy, It is a horror movie without any jump-scares or any other horror movie tropes and it is a comic-book origin movie about the most notorious and iconic villain. This movie will make you uncomfortable very often but ultimately it will force upon you some difficult questions that most movies shy away from asking. This is one of the few comic-book movies which will force you to think for hours after you have seen it.Joker is a movie about Arthur Fleck (played brilliantly by ""Joaquin Phoneix"") who had some psychopathic tendencies but due to deteriorating conditions of Gotham and certain events that took place in the span of the movie leads him to lose it completely and become the villain we all know as Joker. The movie in its 2-hour runtime focuses completely on Arthur Fleck and shows his descent into becoming the joker and that journey is very well showcased, sometimes it is so realistic that some might consider it almost horror-like. The main credit goes to Joaquin Phoneix for such brilliant acting definitely Oscar-worthy, he is the main reason that the journey is believable you may feel bad for the character but you will also be able to feel the darkness deep inside which endorse his actions, the darkness which is slowly unravelled throughout the span of the movie. The rest of the supporting casts were great as well especially Robert De Niro.The movie is directed by Todd Philips who before this had only directed movies like Hangover and Due date. This movie was a great departure from his usual type of movies but he pulled it off, you could tell he is a big Scorsese fan as this movie is heavily inspired by Taxi Driver. Like Taxi Driver this movie is a bit of a slow burner and slowly picks up the pace which really helps in understanding the character a lot better especially since this movie was a character study. As the descent into madness started so does the pacing of the movie.The cinematography was very beautiful, the tone of the movie really helped in showcasing the deteriorating Gotham and characters. The soundtrack of the movie was also very good again I think it was very similar to Taxi Driver, It wasn't omnipresent, though when played it increased the tension very easily.I am really glad that a movie like this exists. When comic-book movies are so saturated it is important that we have directors and actors who take risks like these. Projects like these (if successful) could break the monotony that has shrouded the comic-book genre. You may not end up liking the movie but that should not stop you from recognising it for its uniqueness and its bold take. Having said that I really loved this movie to bits and would love to see it again and again for its mesmerising performances, beautiful cinematography, lovely score and especially for its unique take."
1407,"Joaquin is the perfect example of what it means for an actor to carry a film. He is simply one of the greatest ever. However, the chronological order, as well as the predictability of this film, makes it far from perfect. Oscar worthy? Well sure, in cinematography as well as in the best actor category. But if it is rewarded with more than that, I'd be surprised."
1408,"This movie is significantly overrated.
I watched and I was bored. All this misery, darkness and I was hoping for some light, but ended in same misery as started.
So basically this movie about nothing.
Has no plot.
Three stars is for acting.
Zero stars for everything else"
1409,One of the worst movies I saw. Phoenix did well but Heath was in a different level. This movie has got nothing but a boring plot on how joker character has been created. But taking 2hrs for that is awfully long.
1410,"This is a rather dark and sick movie that I would not recommend to anyone. However, you may want to watch it just to see how irrelevant the Academe Awards have become. Joaquin Phoenix has real life mental disturbance issues and he is certainly type cast well in this movie. I guess he got the Oscar for actually being crazy, but I don't think most people would really care to watch this mess."
1411,"Joaquin Phoenix-starrer Joker is solid in both its craft and storytelling but the violence is unsettling and leans dangerously close to being irresponsible and depends upon the emotional titillation of the audience. The story is diverse and depends upon the perspective of the audience. The psychological
aspects of the show are fairly accurate and it also depicts the financial gap between the rich and poor, the upbringing of their children and the daily problems faced by them."
1412,"The story line was centre-staged on the creation of joker, the most iconic villain of the batman series we have watched before. The acting was very natural and the way the mental illness was portrayed needs a standing ovation. The popular look of joker was portrayed with spooky green hair and evil makeup of the joker which made the movie more appealing. The script was outstanding and many dialogues became popular lines and got imprinted on my mind. The famous line ""put on a happy face"" has a deep meaning in the movie and highlights so many emotions and sufferings. Overall the movie was thrilling and everytime you watch you will not be able to predict what can happen next."
1413,"You know I really wanted to like this film, but to me the plot was a let down and Joaquin Phoenix's performance while good didn't quite match the hype. It had great production, the cinematography, sound production and editing were all good.
I didn't buy into this character becoming a criminal mastermind, there was no hint of this guy having the intelligence the Joker is known, there was no plan to his actions, just reaction to his situation, unhinged reaction but nothing more. And there was no wacky monologues the Joker is know for, not it even a hint of it.
I was going to say it left me wanting more but no, I can't see me giving this incarnation of the joker anymore of my time."
1414,"I have long been a fan of Joaquin Phoenix, but this film blew me away. I was overwhelmed by his presence and absolute ownership of the role. I didn't expect a lot from this film. I knew that Phoenix had won the Oscar, but I did not expect such an overwhelming performance. One of the best films I have seen in years."
1415,"Did not know what to expect, the joker is a cartoon character and this film has brought him to life. A psychological study of how an individual can descend into a criminal monster.
Great film and worthy of the hype surrounding it. This will be remembered as Phoenix's finest role and will define him as among the greats."
1416,"Although Phoenix delivered an outstanding performance, the story is poor. Very long dialogues in the beginning, some action but finally the end is disappointing. This is not worth a 10."
1417,"I was very nervous when I went to see this film. The joker character is one of my favorite ch of all time, and I was worried showing the characters origin story would take away the mystery and make him less interesting. This film however put so much thought and effort into his background that I left the theater completely in love.
Joaquin phoenix did a perfect job playing as Arthur, and he absolutely deserves that Oscar. He is without a doubt the best part of the film. I cried, cheered, was worried and in suspense fall throughout the film because of him.
Everytime I watch the film I discover something new that adds more to the story. There is so much detail shown throughout the film that it really makes me appreciate how much effort Todd Phillips put into this film. There are so many different ways to interpret the film that it constantly has me evaluating it trying to come up with different theories as of what's going on.
There are a few flaws I noticed, or at least small things that bothers me. But the good heavily outweighs the bad, and the flaws I've noticed don't take away from the story or the drama. This film is truly a must see. The cinematography, acting, drama, story, and score is done so wonderfully that you'll always be engaged"
1418,"No comments.....
best achievement in every way ..."
1419,"Fan of comics, Joker was before this movie a comic's charactere, now is a real man. Thx a lot for this movie and this performance !!! Great movie."
1420,"Joker is not only the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life or the best movie of the 2010s, it's the greatest comic book movie. No comic film before or after will ever come close to this level of greatness. Everything about this movie from the gripping emotional story to the tone to the music the acting and cinematography is just amazing. The best part is no CGI and it proved you don't need it to tell a good storyJoaquin Phoenix plays the best live action Joker we have ever seen. Throughout the movie we see his character, Arthur Fleck, constantly abused, mocked, bullied and picked on by society just because he's different. That he has a condition and is viewed as an outcast. By day he works as a party clown, while also taking care of his ill mother. It gets to the point where Arthur reached his breaking point and slowly transforms into the Clown Prince of Crime as we knowThis movie also did a brilliant job with adding so much realism and how society treats not just people like Arthur but anyone in general. There's a lot of nasty people out there that will take advantage and leave you high an dry when they have no more use for youA true masterpiece and a work of art"
1421,Joaquin Phoenix performance is not the best this year !! It is actually the best of the decade . I have watched this movie for 4 times until now ! Well deserved Oscar Joker .
1422,"I didn't want to like this movie. I thought that a Joker movie without Batman in it just wouldn't work and that it was a dumb idea. I have never been more wrong. The Joker was a very well made movie with great drama and a great story. The thing that really gets me are the messages of the movie. The story is about a guy who was beaten by society and treated like garbage until one day he snaps and shakes the system. I love how the Joker's jokes are something that nobody else can get because they don't understand. When I first seen the movie I would've given it a score of 7 or 8, but the movie really grown on me, so I have to give it a 10."
1423,"So this comes from someone who is not into Super Hero movies and the like but when he one the Oscar for bets Actor, I decided to watch it .
This is outstanding.Yes it's dark and a bit disturbing at times, but it can also be taken as a life lesson to us all .Extraordinary acting performance from Phoenix and well worth his Oscar."
1424,"Someone had to step out of the safe game played by Superhero movies. This movie is about a character, not action or explosions. Joaquin Phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and how power can be obtained. Todd Phillips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music, camera angles, lighting and every other important aspect of the film. The movie gave me instant 'Taxi Driver' and 'King of Comedy' vibes, without copying both films. This movie will drag you into your deepest thoughts, in your darkest secrets and suffering.
Coming to the inevitable comparison of who's the better joker - Heath or Joaquin? The answer is - both did a phenomenal job. And Joker is fortunate to have being played by two phenomenal actors.
Finally, whether you like it or not, there's no denying you're going to be talking for a long, long time."
1425,I was unsure about how would feel about a stand alone Joker movie. Being a big Batman fan I was unsure what it would be like. How wrong i was. Jaoquin Phoenix 's performance as the disturbed and derranged Arthur Fleck and his descent into the clown prince of crime we all know was incredible. I forgot I was watching an actor and thought i was watching a documentary. He is on par with Heath Ledger's joker for sheer performance. Watch this movie
1426,This movie is a great well made movie. It tells a story about a failed comedian and has a very good plot. Not recommended for small children
1427,"In terms of directing, it's a spot on. Todd Phillips smoothly guides Joaquin Phenix into an incredible believable madness and takes you along the ride. All supporting actors, no matter how small the role, did also a great job. I loved to see Robert De Niro back into acting, not just making a ""Robert De Niro impression"". Now let's talk cinematography, well, I honestly think that Lawrence Sher deserves an Oscar, or at least some type of recognition. He just creates the perfect atmosphere: the choice of lens, the color spectrum used, the angles, etc.
I also want to mention that the whole team has done a great job to create a timeless cinematic experience. I think there must be very few teams (acting, directing, producing, sound engineering, etc) in the industry, not just now, who could get together and give us such a master piece.
On paper it might seem a long movie, but just after the first very few minutes you're hooked until the final credits are on the screen.
Go and treat yourself for a real cinematic experience."
1428,"Of course, coming out with a DC film after the reception of both Batman vs Superman and Justice League, there was going to be some skepticism.The main question coming from skeptics like me was: Will this film be an interpretation of the Joker on-par or if not, better than Heath Ledger's incredible performance in The Dark Knight?And the film absolutely delivered.I don't want to compare the performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Heath Ledger as they are both great in their own right and take different approaches to how the Joker is represented as a whole, but I can say that Phoenix's performance as the Joker is definitely as Oscar-worthy as Heath Ledger's Joker.The film, as a whole does a great job of slowly showing the progression of Arthur Fleck's character and how the city of Gotham and the world around him has affected how he lives his life and eventually becomes the Joker, with a unique approach to his origin story that works very well in an adaption to the comics.One thing that may people I know didn't like was how they incorporated the origin story of Batman in the film, right at the end. I disagree with them because this reinforces the idea that there is no Joker without Batman - that they must exist together no matter what, that they are the true representations of good and bad and even if Joker remains as a standalone film, I think having that small connection between the origin of Batman and the origin of the Joker is vital.Joker is one of the, if not, the best screen adaption of comic book material in cinema and deserves huge praise for all areas of it's production."
1429,"The worst part of having a mental illness is people expecting you to behave as if you don't. Wow. What a truthful statement. The reason this film is so controversial is the fact that the general public dosent like a mirror being held up to the minorities who share the bus with them, who work with them and who walk by them in the street unnoticed. Embrace those around you who struggle with the everyday and remember to include them. We are all worth something."
1430,"I wouldn't change a thing. Absolutely perfectly paced, dialogued and acted. I WANT SEQUELS!"
1431,"I must have changed my text ten times now and I now realise that when a movie is a Masterpiece there must be just silence and respect...so I ll just sit here and bow to the director and to Joaquin Phoenix who serves it in the best possible way...thank you for all these feelings i felt,thank you for this touching chello music, thank you for these soulful dance mooves, thank you for this amazing performance...Joaquin you deserve an Oscar,you are brilliant!!"
1432,It makes me really feel upset when high score on such bad movie and I regret wasting 2 hours watching it.
1433,A masterpiece of a movie that does what few movies ever do. It makes you feel uncomfortable and asks questions about humanity. Not everyone had the best start. Some have it worse than others. As a society do we care enough.
1434,Truly a masterpiece to the Batman universe. A new layer and approach.
1435,"So I wasn't sure what to expect. I'd heard some of the hype and I've always been a fan of the Joker stories in the past. I knew Todd Phillips was a decent filmmaker and Joaquin was an amazing actor. What I didn't know, was how well-crafted this film would be. I didn't realize the length of the movie wouldn't be noticed because of how transfixed you were on Joaquin as Joker. I was mesmerized! The viewer is completely immersed into Arthur's world. You feel as if you're a fly on the wall, watching and holding your breath from the intensity. It's truly amazing, to not see an actor but to just simply see Arthur or Joker. I haven't felt this immersed in a character since Daniel Day Lewis played Abraham Lincoln. He deserves all of the buzz, all of the recognition and all of the praise. I'm almost disturbed by his performance because it was so raw and so real. I'm just awe struck."
1436,"There's not much to say, from Joaquin's acting to Arthur's descent to insanity, this movie was so good. I am just mad at the media for saying ""this is going to inspire introverts like Arthur to shoot up a movie theater"" just because there was was a shooting in The Dark Knight, another movie that happened to have the Joker. But in reality the shooter picked the biggest screened movie at the time at random. It's rare to see a movie like this actually come out because of all the censorship of the media and everything has to be family friendly. Remember when in 2008, Call of Duty: World at War came out, nobody really cared about the nazi imagery or violence but just cared that it was a great representation of war? Why can't it be like that? Why does everyone have to be offended by every small detail these days? I know this has absolutely nothing to do with Joker anymore, but I can't think of another movie that was controversial because of the media and turned out to be amazing, because all the other ones have all been scared to be too realistic. Anyways, this is great movie."
1437,"Even while watching the movie for the second time it pulls me in so deep, it overwhelmes me with emotions and I'm left exhausted by the time the end credits roll in. Juaquin Phoenix manages to capture that certain moment of desperation and despair that only an unlucky few know about. The plot, the rest of the cast are left wanting but this movie is carried by the outstanding performance of Mr. Phoenix."
1438,"My God, this film is freaking amazing, and Phoenix gives the best performance ever. Think of Heath, a genius that deserved the Oscar, go the other way. Polar opposite interpretations. But both flawless and deserving of awards. See this film. If Phoenix does not get the Oscar, I will riot. Amazing."
1439,"If you didn't feel his pain, you have no soul. Amazing acting by Joaquin Phoenix."
1440,"We really yearned for this one. In a day where you get shoved down the throat with cheap lines and cliché scenes we've got a movie, a film that really gets us back to what a film or a movie is supposed to be about. Something to shock you, to stop you for a moment, to take you in a world where the emotions are placed in the gestalt of the world perceived. It really connects well. Joaquin and Todd really overachieved this one for this age. Maybe just another film for older generation today but a masterpiece of the time for this generation."
1441,"In many aspects, it is a mirror. For society, for viewer, for the way of development of society. Its basic virtues - the splendid performance of Joaquin Phoenix and the beautiful cinematography. And, sure, the ignore of comic book character for feel the film not as portrait but as large cry. The sins - maybe too much ""Taxi Driver"" and the ambition to explain and show everything. The angry, the frustrations, the refuges, the falls of mind and soul are only suggested for be, in real sense, credible. Short, a form of manifesto. Or only a sort of mirror for each of its viewers."
1442,"Despite his illnes Arthur Fleck has an inner good soul! Society helps to create a monster! This movie has a magnificient screenplay, a wonderful Joaquin Phoenix undoubtedly he is now an Oscar award winner!"
1443,"Evil but beautiful...
Todd Philips truely deserves a salute.
Absolute Masterpiece.
Coming to the cast
Joaquin phoenix is GOD...
Di niro made his mark
Rest are outnumbered by phoenix's presence.
Must watch CULT CLASSIC"
1444,"I have to admit I have a short attention span however I could not even look away for a second during this movie.It's so hard to watch the pain Arthur is going through, battling with mental illness myself and seeing his journal in the beginning saying how people expect you to act like nothing is wrong hit home.This movie is not your average comic book, this is a deep though provoking drama.
Phoenix is INCREDIBLE"
1445,"This movie come out with a different play I will say. Watching the trailer I dreamed about the movie would be much dark and more sympathetic to Joker. But in the hall I couldn't keep my eyes off the movie. It wasn't the movie that I thought it would be. Phoenix acting deserves some memorable rewards. I would recommend everyone can watch the movie if he/she has heart and brain to understand it. Do not go to the negative way, there is a lot to live in affirmative. Tod you are awesome. And sound effects were mind blowing. Hats off..."
1446,"I don't write many reviews but clearly this movie is worth seeing. What a great performance, I really push all film-lover to go and watch this movie."
1447,The cinematic piece of art tells a unique and beautifully rethought origin story of the iconic villain Joker. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is captivating; everything from the way he dances to the way he forces smiles upon his face in the movie. The work of art integrates the stigma around mental health in our society today while dramatically showing how mistreated Arthur Fleck was by the fictional society in which he lives. Who would've thought that such a movie could be so moving? This film is special... the type that doesn't come around very often. It deserves endless credit and is 100% worth the watch.
1448,"Very Good Good Good
this did deserve higher than Oscar"
1449,Abit of a slow start but loved every minute. Can't wait for a second!
1450,"I went to see this movie a couple of weeks ago expecting a decent movie. However, after I came out of the theater I was shocked at the level of dedication needed to play the Joker. Joaquin Phoenix had to lose a ton of weight until he was basically skin and bone and play a convincing slide into insanity. His acting is so amazing that you forget that you are even watching a movie at all, and it is so mesmerizing to watch his new take on the Joker. This movie was engaging all the way through and had a perfect ending to match. What a fantastic movie."
1451,"""Joker"" is without a doubt the greatest film I've ever seen, (and I've seen my fair share) thats not overstating it one bit on my part, the sheer impact this film had on me was overwhelming, and the absolute and genuine empathy I had for Arthur Fleck is heart felt, and the dark subject matter it deals with is true to our times, I was fully engrossed with him and in his corner throughout, I instantly knew I had just watched a masterpiece, from the very beginning to the very end of this film it has you totally and utterly encapsulated and fully absorbed, i urge everyone to see Joker you'll be watching the art of movie making! a Joker sequel could work or it could just be a stand alone film it really is that versatile 10/10 I would give it 100/10 if I could. 👌🏻🤡👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻"
1452,"This movie was AMAZINGLY beautiful. I'm sorry for the people that dumbed this down to a ""social commentary""! They must have the emotional depth of a mud puddle. It shines a light on the darkness of untreated mental illness as well as cultural anarchy and instability. This was SO much more than an ""origin story"". It truly shows the inner demons and struggles that many have with social norms and the forced chaoticness of everyone's internal struggles with their own personal truths.This movie is not for stupid people."
1453,Probably the best movie Iv ever watched. Iv seen all the jokers but this one deserve the oscar.
1454,"I've gotta say that I was hesitant when a new Joker movie was announced. DCEU movies have so far been hit or miss (I'm lookin at you mr. leto). When I heard the dude from the Hangover series was going to direct it, my emotions were confused. I couldn't help think who could possibly fill the big shoes left behind by the late great Heath Ledger?A filthy analysis
~Joaquin Phoenix transforms into a malnourished, misunderstood loner who suffers from involuntary laughter and a truly pitiful life in general. Arthur Fleck's lanky figure, wicked dance moves and brooding facial expressions accurately overtly reflect the mental roller-coaster this man undergoes everyday.
~Thing is, no one around him seems to care. His delusional mother clings to her suspicious past and is seemingly unaware of Arthur's deteriorating condition. His boss at work and his supposed friends treat him like a joke(r). Hell, he's even getting beat up by children that stole his spinning sign. Is this commentary on bullying and mental health stigma in the current sociopolitical landscape? The media warned of disenfranchised teens becoming inspired by the movie to carry out acts of terror. Is this kind of fear rationalized and if so, if the mental health crisis has really reached a tipping point where a movie can become frighteningly real, what's stopping the Joker from becoming a reality?
~Now his condition was somewhat explained in the movie but it exists in real life as Involuntary Emotional Expression Disorder, and is often caused by traumatic brain injury. We see this type of injury is common in those suffering from pathological It's revealed that Arthur was physically abused by his mother's boyfriend, which could potentially be the determining factor in birth of Joker?
~The driver of this transformation from Arthur to Joker is the discontinuation of his prescriptions and his visitation to a social worker. His delusions of grandeur on Murray's stage are amplified to the point where his fantasies include a relationship with the beautiful Zazie Beetz. I know Arthur, me too man.
~The film includes shots of Arthur banging his head against the wall of his cell, crawling into his refrigerator, and institutionalized in a mental facility. ""All I have are bad thoughts"" he says as he recounts his origin story in his mind. The film ends with his time in the facility, and blood on his shoes. It's heavily implied that he killed his therapist, which directly contradicts Arthur's own record of targeting those who've wronged him (at least loosely). Can we rely on Arthur Fleck to accurately recount the details of his origins, when we aren't sure what he considers injustice? Can we assess a character's traits and moral values if we don't even know who he truly is?The cinematography of the film accurately reflects the psychological burden that Arthur Fleck endures. The bleak, poverty-stricken landscape of Gotham from Arthur's perspective is different from what we're used to, a billionaires perspective. The film utilizes call-backs and jarring transitions to build and feel the tension Arthur's feeling his life is in a downward spiral.And finally the acting, while everyone across the board brought strong performances to the table, the most gripping performance is by none other than Joaquin Phoenix. This man singlehandedly brought seat-gripping tension with just his facial expressions and jaw-dropping climactic conclusions (deaths) to many, many unfortunate characters. The academy would be absolutely bonkers if he does not get nominated.Every now and then there's a film that changes the landscape of cinema, while also reminding me of why I love to watch movies. The Joker proves that high budget, CGI-infested blockbusters isn't the only formula for a successful movie. The deep social commentary from the perspective of a mentally ill patient is a fresh breath of air from how it's normally portrayed in media. It would be easy for us to dismiss a character like Arthur as pathological serial killer, and no one would blame you for that. Each of us at the individual level contain a little bit of the pain that Joker carries around, and a whole lot more compassion to offer others in their time of need.Go watch this movie and give someone a hug and tell them you love them, 10/10."
1455,"Seriously, I'm just going to cut all the way through the BS. I love movies, I have always loved movies. I know what's good and what's bad. You need to go see this right now. Movies like this rarely come along, maybe once or twice in a lifetime, go see it."
1456,"I enjoyed the movie it has a grittiness and indeed the acting is top notch. My problem is the story. Though the story of how the Joker becomes the Joker it doesn't do much else. I would expect the story to contain something more, some great lines, memorable moments something to keep the tension heightened but it doesn't. Yes it's well acted, and one of my friends tried comparing it to Taxi Driver but coming out of the movie I asked him to provide me one memorable quote/line and he couldn't (I can provide you several for Taxi Driver that I watched over 20 years ago). So yeah it's a good movie and worth seeing but don't expect a lot to happen, and definitely it's no masterpiece. I gave it a solid 7."
1457,"One of the best films I've seen. Joaquin Phoenix should get an Oscar for his portrayal of Arthur Fleck. The unraveling of a person suffering from mental illness was tough to watch in some scenes but I never felt his behaviour wasn't justified. I left the cinema feeling sorry for a man who'd always felt different and had been treated badly from a young age. JP didn't just throw himself into the role , he became Arthur. Not as violent as I was expected either so I don't reslly understand the controversy when it was released."
1458,"The anticipation that I felt walking into this movie is very rare. I can only compare it to the same feeling of walking into a Christopher Nolan movie or Avengers endgame. It's an incredibly high bar of expectation and there was a thick atmosphere of excitement in the theater. I found this movie to be a masterpiece of film-making with an incredible lead performance. It covers the full spectrum. Wonderful storytelling and emotional beats, mixed with powerful dialogue and beautiful cinematography. The movie doesn't shy away from violence, and there is even some humorous moments of levity among the chaos and madness. I can't say enough about Joaquin Phoenix. He's a very special talent. The subtlety of his abilities are a joy to behold. He's a master of his craft. There are many standout moments in this movie and it tackles many very real issues - such as mental health awareness and social isolation. Highly recommended."
1459,"Incredible, believable depiction of not only mental illness but of a man who can be seen as a legitimate human being in the real world. Unlike Heath (RIP), this Joker is less of a ""performance"" and more of a legitimate depiction of the real mental illness GOOD people face. He reconstructs what ""good"" truly is and, in contrast, the powers that be define what ""good"" is for their own advantage.Rant/related to movie content:
The wealthy make laws to ***k all the other people they deem inferior or unwealthy, and a lot of us really are ***ked by the likes of these elitist egotistical devils.Anyways, enough of that. Watch the movie."
1460,Maybe the best movie in about 20 years or so. I was just blown away.
1461,"This movie is depressing, brilliant and so real it's uncomfortable to watch. That being said, Joaquin Phoenix delivers the best acting I have ever seen and this movie delivers a very realistic look at how the unfortunate, mentally ill, weak and awkward live as well as how they are treated. By the end of this movie, I found myself actually cheering for The Joker fueled by the compassion and sorrow I had for his hardships and the lack of support he sustained from a society that not only failed him but made it clear that no one really cares. It leaves you with the realization that yep, this is the world we live in, the real world, where the rich and privileged rule. I wanted The Joker to make his official appearance and cause an uprising of people who are so sick of being ignored and treated like dirt that they find a hero from a crazy, violent, broken man. This movie does not hold back, it comes at you full force and stirs emotions that are confusing. We're not supposed to cheer for the villain. But then, who is actually the villain?"
1462,"I can't believe that avengers as a better rating, that people cried and clapped at the end of avengers, full blown standing ovation, i was ready to get up at the end l
Of joker and clap as hard as i could, i knew it, i was sure about it, it was the best movie of the years maybe even the decade, but no, i was the only one with my brother and one other guy who got up and clapped at how good the movie, but nobody else...Joker is a dark and slow drama/thriller about a man living in a bad and difficult place, this place is called Gotham, you already know this place by heart as a fan, am I right?No, the joker will surprise you on every point, the soundtrack, the twist, the performance of Joaquin Phoenix. Everything makes sense and is really well put and done in this film. You are not only following a terrible man who wants to destroy the world, no, you are following the growing hatred of a man who has tried everything to be happy but will never be.It's a masterpiece that people will be talking about for years and oh my God, please. This film needs a better audience rating than the other shameless, useless and senseless disgusting things called avengers."
1463,"The best movie of 2019!!!
GREAT BACKGROUND SCORE!!
VERY GREAT CHARACTER BUILD UP!!
TOP NOTCH ACTING!!
Perfect Movie!!!"
1464,"Best DC/Marvel movie by a mile! Best Dark movie ever! Phoenix's performance as good as I've ever seen! If he doesn't win the Oscar then the Oscars are a Joke (pun intended)! OK, some parts are predictable but who cares! Too good to miss. Takes Dark to a whole new blacker level! A must see Masterpiece!!"
1465,"I had to create an account to write a review because I never write reviews but this movie just forced me to.The character development, the story, the acting, bigger picture. All put in beautifully that any viewer can follow and understand. Joaquin puts on a performance of the century. You can feel all character's emotions in this movie and suddenly forget you are watching a categorized ""villain"". This is way more than a superhero flick. This a deep psychological fictional tale of how someone or anyone can radically transform because of their circumstances and how society treats them.Don't expect so much action. The action is in the character. No useless unnecessary scenes. No CGI. No childish cliche flicks and stunts. This is as raw and real as it gets and has an epic ending.If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get an Oscar, then the Oscars are rigged. I know there are more movies to come but no move will revolve around a single character transforming and changing in this way.Screw the critics...they judge on their own. You are part of the overwhelming majority of the population. Watch it with a clear and sober head and you will not be disappointed.
I didn't give it a 10 because that's just me. I don't believe in perfection. I'm just giving it a 9 in case I see something better in the future but it's a 10 in my at the moment."
1466,"That movie got me like no other has ever had. I couldn't even breath at some parts. What a great actor, what a great story. The movie was only started for 10 minutes and I was already like ""WHAT A GREAT ACTOR"". I've missed movies like this. You can't get distracted by anything while watching this movie, is just amazing. Have no words. What a movie... INCREDIBLE! Give that man an Oscar, please!!!!"
1467,"A film about the Joker. What a great idea! Jared Leno must be delighted to be front and centre as arguably one of the most famous and recognisable bad-guys ever in popular culture. Unfortunately, DC's 'shared universe' ran into one or ten problems and has become fractured into... well, no one really knows what. Only that Jared Leno's 'Joker' appears to have been dumped after his woefully small appearance in 'Suicide Squad' and now Joaquin Phoenix puts on the clown make-up for the role.How 'Joker' fits in with what has been and what is left of DC's original attempt at bringing 'Justice League' together is anyone's guess. If you liked (or hated!) all those previous installments it doesn't really matter. Don't go into this film looking to see how it ties in. There might be a sequel, there might now. It doesn't matter. This film is so good that I almost hope it stays as a 'stand alone' film, just in case the quality deteriorates.Phoenix plays 'Arthur Fleck' (yup, no more 'Jack Napier' here!), a down-on-his-luck resident of Gotham City who struggles with his mental health issues while just about scraping a living working as a clown and looking after his sickly mother. It's rare that a film - even one that's mainly about a single individual - actually has that character in every scene. With 'Joker' there's rarely a minute where Phoenix isn't on screen... and therefore stealing the scene. Robert DeNiro is also on the cast list and - yes - obviously he's excellent (but he's not in it that much, so don't expect too much screen time for him). It's also interesting that many people also see the similarities of two of DeNiro's other work. If you've seen (and, if not, I recommend you watch) 'Taxi Driver' or 'King of Comedy' then you'll see more than a few nods here and there.I know that many recent Batman fans will say that there's no other Joker than Heath Ledger and us oldies will always say that Jack Nicholson did it best. I certainly won't argue with anyone who admires either of their performances, but Phoenix shows that, even stepping into their big clown shoes, he can still bring something new to the role.Yes, it's - technically - a superhero film, but it never really feels like one. There are no lavish computer-generated special effects of heroes/villains with superpowers. There are plenty of points which obviously link in to the whole 'Batman mythos,' but you could almost watch this film as more of a study of mental illness than an 'origin story' for the Joker.It may not be for everyone. Yes, it is brutal and there are some shockingly-real acts of graphic violence here and there. There's been a lot of speculation in the media about 'Joker's' hidden meaning and the impact creating a film about a villain and promoting them as a 'hero.' Personally, I don't think that anyone (sane) would ever commit any sore of crime because of a movie, even this one. One reviewer said it best when he said that there wasn't a massive spike in violent crime after the cinematic release of 'American Psycho' so why would there be one now with 'Joker?' The character 'Joker' - despite being the focus of the story - is never really shown as some sort of 'role model' for us all to follow. We may understand - some of - his motives, but anyone in their right mind would never truly wish to emulate him.I don't want to give away anything away about the plot as this is a film you really do need to watch yourself. I'm not one to say who should be in line for an Oscar. I don't know whether Phoenix will win one (probably not), but his performance is definitely worthy of praise."
1468,"From beginning to end, Joker will have all of your attention and you will be blown away. An origin for the ages! Dark, stark, harsh and real."
1469,"This. Was. Simply. BRILLIANT! Everything seemed so well thought out, so remarkably executed and so on... Would love to go and see this movie once again for sure."
1470,"The performance of phoenix its great...right in the spot of a mental ill crazy person...the script its for an average film,you always gonna guess whats next...i think (Personal opinnion) that the movie it is what it is just by the performance of phoenix...If the joker had been leto this gonna be an awfull joker movie."
1471,"Hauntingly Brilliant , a hard watch at times as Athur struggles through a torturous life.
The Brilliant soundtrack and Dark tone of the film which all DC films should have makes it easily slot in as a prequel to Christopher Nolan .. The Dark Knight
Time line would be out or would it ? Depending how you explain the ending"
1472,This is my first time ever writing s comment and this definitely worths a 10. The story is told in a such a contradictory way that can be so touching at the same time.
1473,"Bursting with emotion. This film has won me over and dug me out of a ditch of cheap CGI fan fare.Absolutely outstanding. Really well filmed. It's pace, tone and character impressions really pay off. Most of the time you like your sat on the edge of Joaquin's feelings.Joker is a classic. And a cinema masterpiece. It was beautifully filmed."
1474,"""Joker"" is not a comic-book movie. It's a gritty, psychological thriller that delves into the mind of one lonely man, who is subject to the cruelties and neglect of society, and finally dissolves into a path of insanity that leaves him irredeemable. It's unsettling and so grounded in reality that while it does take some inspiration from ""Killing Joke"", Todd Phillips generates an original story that ultimately reinvents the character of the Joker.That being said, a comparison to Heath Ledger's Joker is just not applicable. Firstly, it's an origin story so that immediately removes the aura of mystery Ledger's Joker. The Joker in ""The Dark Knight"" is just a being of unknown origin, present to wreck havoc and be the perfect antithesis to what Batman stands for. ""Joker"" is about a lonely man named Arthur Fleck who gradually descends to into a being of madness who happens to be called the ""Joker"". He's not really the Joker from the comics. Perhaps that's because it's an origin story so that some of his most defining characteristics like his charm and genius-intellect are not fully-fleshed out yet. I totally respect the decision to totally reinvent the Joker, but I missed those aspects of the character, and ultimately, I'm hesitant to call Arthur Fleck the Joker.Despite the radically different character, Joaquin Phoenix slays his portrayal of this man. This movie is a showcase of his performance and cements the fact that the Joker is probably, if not already, the most coveted comic-book character to be portrayed in cinema. There are side characters portrayed by Robert DeNiro, Zazie Beetz, etc. However, this is Phoenix's show and his performance was brilliant, haunting, disturbing and moving. His interpretation of the Joker laugh is so nuanced, that it's more than just a trademark of a character. You can see and hear the pain, sadness, anger from his laughs as he ponders whether his life is a tragedy or comedy. He brought new dimensions to the Joker character, leading us at one point to empathize with him, his sorrow, and we watch helplessly as his character just falls into a path of no return.The script is well-polished and I appreciate that it takes its time and opts for a slow pace to ensure that Arthur Fleck's transition is natural, not forced and abrupt. The result is a dark brooding thriller which I feel can be segmented into two parts; the first of which depicts the crumbling of the wall between Arthur Fleck and insanity, followed by the latter half where things get unsettling and ramps up to accommodate Arthur's full transformation. Some scenes are disturbing, but that's what you'd expect to see in a movie that aims to delve into the mind of someone like the Joker. I do feel the main story arc is a bit too predictable, particularly in the second half of the movie. There's not a lot of impactful twists. That said, the score by Hildur Guðnadóttir is brilliant, as it compliments the dark atmosphere of the movie very well, with its sorrowful melodies and haunting background. It is music you don't want to listen to alone.All in all, ""Joker"" is a really good movie, and a very brave one too, bringing in topics that are relevant today. It brings to light the subjects of mental illness, and social neglect of those affected by the former. I'm not sure if it's really trying to make a statement about it, whether it's trying to say that anyone, if pushed enough, can be someone like the Joker. That would sort of take the ""special"" out of the Joker's character. It's definitely not the typical comic-book movie and the Joker here is not the Joker you typically know. But it is a very good psychological character study of a man crumbling to madness, powered by the brilliant performance of Joaquin Phoenix."
1475,"#Joker is intense, bold, disturbing, and surprisingly poignant at times. Joaquin Phoenix gives a stunning performance that's equally as disturbing as it is emotionally layered. Oscar-worthy in every way. Beautiful cinematography and an incredible score by Hildur Guðnadóttir."
1476,"Good film, but I've got mixed feelings about it.Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar. No question about that.Let's just say that the film is a very self-contained story, intimate, and emotionally driven. The cinematography, editing, and music are spectacular.It doesn't feel like a 2-hour film thanks to Joaquin Phoenix mesmerizing performance. But I think the film does suffer a bit of the old artsy style-over-substance syndrome. Having said that, the style is superb. Not original ('Taxy Driver'), but superb.My only issue is that the plot itself is a bit bland. I would've liked Arthur Fleck's transformation to have been slower and longer, and it's climax more shocking and brutal.Overall, 'Joker' is probably the best film based on a DC character since 'The Dark Knight'."
1477,"I had avoided all the trailers and press on this film and in all honestly, didn't expect much from it. DC films haven't been the greatest over the past lot of years and here we are again with WB trying to go down another route to try and make something of it...Well - I'm only glad they did.Joker is quite simply one of the finest pieces of film I have seen in a long time - especially from Hollywood, which isn't too often. From Joaquin's incredible performance (just amazing), to the stunning cinematography and score, I just can't think of a single moment that lost me.Well done Todd Phillips and team, and well done Joaquin for the greatest performance of the Joker ever!"
1478,"People were expecting this movie and this joker to be just like The Dark Knight, but how can it be when they're showing his journey from the beginning, and realistically speaking, how can a normal man with no history of violence can do what the Joker from dark knight did? I'm in love with the new storyline, and how society and some mental illnesses made him what he is, the whole movie makes so much sense. if the Joker is a real person in this world that would be the how he turned into Joker, that what makes it a 10/10, + the effects, the cinematography and how dark the violence is, and in my opinion without overhyping it, i consider it the movie of the decade."
1479,Great great movie! Will have you thinking about it for days after you've seen it. So much space for thinking. Phenomenal acting
1480,Joaquin Phoenix preformed one of the best characters I've ever seen
1481,Joker is an original movie that may be slow for some people who cant sit patiently as you are rewarded with dramatic tension. I really do time my rest room breaks appropriately but it had me so focused I held it and ran out of my refreshments not to miss a detail. Yes I'll see it again and yes I'll buy it when it comes out. This is creatively told and shown in a rather clever way and allows you to forget that this man used to be Johnny Cash. Amazing performance!!!
1482,"First of all, the message in this film is great especially with what's going on in the world. Everybody who goes to see this movie will probably walk away thinking the exact same thing and know what the message is. At this point I think it's pretty obvious what everybody already knows and I'm just going to put in my five cents and that's Joaquin Phoenix is amazing as Arthur Fleck/Joker and he definitely deserves an Oscar nomination for his role. He went all-in with this character showing the different stages in his life and making everybody feel bad for him. At certain points in the film, I felt really bad for the guy and wanted to help him out because nobody deserves to be treated that way. It also helps that he didn't start out as wanting to become the Joker but society just helped turn him into him. Robert De Niro, who plays Murray Franklin, probably won't get an Oscar nomination for supporting actor but he still did a standout job with his character. Another thing that stood out to me was the cinematography of the movie and how it helped show Arthur's slow descent into madness and how he views the world. I feel like some people are waiting for me to hate on the pacing of this film and honestly, I had no problem with it at all. If the movie was any longer it would have felt like it was dragging on and any shorter and they would have rushed the Joker transformation. But with that in mind, this film is like most people have said already and that's a character story. So, if you don't want to watch a story about a man who's driven to his breaking point and wants to see an action superhero then stay home and watch The Dark Knight. I love how the costume was different from any Joker suit we've seen before, though it's hard to replicate without buying a store-bought costume. The music by Hildur Guonadottir was amazing. In the end, this movie is an amazing character story with an important message. I give Joker a 10/10."
1483,Ignore the bitter Batman loving weirdos who give this a 1/10. It's brilliant on all levels.
1484,"There is no ""superhero"" movie even close to this masterpiece.
I went to the theaters yesterday with an extremely high expectation, because everybody is talking about it.
The movie is a masterpiece! The script, the ""connections"" (you'll understand), the acting (my god... what a acting!), the story and even the music.
Heath Ledger Joker was perfect until yesterday.Now perfection was updated for me.See the movie!"
1485,"I just saw the movie in a small town here in france called le mans. What a masterpiece. this is what I need to see in DC. Dark, violent and well written script.Phoenix was awesome. He delivered a great performance. the man putted a small on my face.thanks Todd for the movie. thak WW, and of course thank you DC"
1486,"Not a single Comicbook movie excited me until this one and that's because of Joaquin and Joaquin only. This character is tailor made for someone like him who has given terrific and criminally underrated performances over the years in films like The Master, Walk The Line, Two Lovers and Inherent Vice. Todd Philips made the right decision to a character study psychological film rather than the usual adventure/action.Gotham City is like NYC in 1970s/80s a city with massive wealth inequality, rising crime and brutal austerity measures. In surroundings like this, a fragile and broken individual like Arthur Fleck is bound to explode but how he does and why he does is what we see for 121 minutes. The undertones on anarchy, capitalism and classism is quite brilliant and this is one of the films where we cheer for the guy we are supposed to dislike.Joaquin Phoenix not only does justice to Heath Ledger in this film but creates an own legacy for himself. It's a shame that a guy who has given better performances in movies like The Master and Walk The Line will probably win his much awaited Oscar for this role, a highly popular character to get noticed."
1487,"This film is something else, being a DC fan all my life, I'm certainly glad to see a different take on The Joker. Joaquin Phoenix is potentially one of the best Jokers now. His laugh is spot on and certainly goes beyond many others. Joaquin's overall performance is powerful and one of best in recent years. Todd Phillip's vision for a gritty non-comic based Joker film really sheds light on the problems Gotham's society. Which can easily portray a number of the problems in our actual society. Things such as lack of funding for mental health, rude and terrible people who only want to bring others down, and simply crime. Many people are scaring audiences about and there's no need to be afraid, this movie is potentially the most realistic take on a comic book Super Villain yet."
1488,"I can't express this is in words, this movie is an experience, you yourself need to experience it. Character build up is out of imagination, acting skills out of this world, over all this movie is a gem."
1489,"Incredible movie, unbelievable acting, a masterpiece!"
1490,"This movie is a precious jewel in the entire history. No one could ever make a movie like this, the character development, Joaquin's acting, every damn second of this movie is overwhelming. This movie is legendary, honestly I don't think anyone could ever make a better movie. Again, Every damn second of this movie is worth it."
1491,"Disturbing, painful, sick, Joaquin Phoenix was crazy"
1492,The darkest movie of the decade with stunning edge of the seat thrilling performance by Phoenix. How the society pushes Arthur to insanity and the character transformation is something to watch out for. Brilliantly made. This movie deserves an Oscar.
1493,"Dear movie freaks, Joker is the most anticipated movie that we have been expecting since the first month of year 2019 and yes this is a very good dramatic movie. I said dramatic because Joker delivers us the ideas on how Arthur Fleck character can be Joker, right when we totally forgot about Batman appearance. We don't care about Batman here. We care about a joker, a comedian, a broken child, and a really sad story of a man who sacrifices everything to be happy, yet we never really understand what is going on his mind and heart, until we saw the killings and the blood and we blame him as a villain. I really salute the Director, the make up team, editor, cinematographer, scriptwriter, and Joacquin Phoenix acting, wow he could win Oscar for this movie. This movie has few actions, but a lot of tears and drama and how we can reflect to ourselves, are we really happy or just a made-up-happy just to make our life comfortable....2 hours are not enough to understand Joker but I really love the ending that you can't watch without clapping your hands. A Masterpiece!"
1494,"The joker is easily the greatest super villains of all time, so a movie focusing solely on this character was either a hit or miss, but a miss it is definitely not.Joker is one of those films which leaves an impactful mark on the viewers.Making full use of the available source material, the film, at the same time feels original and adds a certain amount of depth to it which is brought forward by classic and unpredictable storytelling.Phoenix's portrayal of the uprising crown prince of crime was exceptional in its own right, and is Oscar-worthy without any doubt. In addition, the direction, the writing, the cinematography, the music, the supporting performances were all very impressive.Verdict : Living up to the hype, this super villain origin story digs deep into the joker's descent into madness, perfectly showcased by a strong leading performance and powerful writing and directing."
1495,"There where certain negative critic reviews online about the movie but I found them to be completely unfair.
A random superhero movie no2: protsgonist/proragonists kill 10.000 People and no one bats an eye.
Joker: kills 5 People and everyone loses their minds.
After all, It is a movie telling the story of an 'antihero', the super villain taken from DC's universe comics and it should be viewed and reviewed as that.It is refreshing to see a different approach on superhero movies, far from the same old recipe of their kind. It has very well-rounded screenplay(well, mostly), stunning photography and directing and the protagonist clearly manages to be a persuasive 'Joker' in his own unique way. Overall, I am hapilly surprised by this movie and enjoyed it very, very much."
1496,Had a lot of expectations after the iconic joker from Heath ledger and Joaquin just met all our expectation.must watch for all
1497,"This is the only movie that I felt giving 10/10 is justice. This movie is so original in every inch and have pushed the boundary of cinema much further. It's perfectly written, be it the script, the music score, the screenplay, the pacing, everything is very masterful. And by the end you'll be really convinced as how the Joker came to be how we know he is. This movie made the story of Batman that we know and love made so much more sense that you'll finally feel complete. I'm looking forward for the Batman movie. With Rob Pattinson cast as Batman, I'm optimistic it's a perfect role for him as how Jacquin Phoenix is the perfect one to play the Joker. Before, you'd think The Dark Knight is a dark story, and Heath Ledger (R.I.P.) is the perfect actor to play the Joker. You'll change your mind. Hats off to you Jacquin. Don't matter what the critique or interviewer say. You and everyone involved in creating this movie has shaked the cinematic world. This movie made the whole Marvel expanded cinematic universe look like they were made by amateurs. So step aside Marvel. DC is coming to reclaim the crown."
1498,"Marvellous,ecstatic,stunning,terrifying!
This teaches how a life goes on in a toxic society.
Atlast the oscar deserves joaquin Phoenix,what a performer."
1499,"Perfect story line, perfect cinematography, perfect sound, everything is perfect. I'm lost for words."
1500,With enough substance to rival an entire cinematic universe!This one will make you stay back and watch the end credits just to applaud the team that put this gem together.And that's because this is not a franchise. This is cinema.There is no merchandising greed on display. Just love. Love for characters that have been a part of our lives for most of our lives.Joker turns the spotlight on the simple art of storytelling that comics are all about.Something that's of late getting hidden under layers and layers of VFX.Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix take it away.And take it away in style.
1501,I loved it and it was amazing. The movie was about an isolated comedian and his problems. I think it could impact in so many people because now everyone feels lonely
1502,"The movie of the year, and maybe decades. Best Picture Oscar. And two more Oscars. Abnormal concussion."
1503,"There are many cinematic classics that I cherish, but I have NEVER had as visceral of a reaction to watching a movie as I did with 'Joker'. It has grown on me tremendously to become my personal all-time favorite film.I remember being absolutely mesmerized by this movie from the very first frame--it shocked me and left me in awe. After my first viewing, I actually had mixed feelings about the film because it's so hard to watch at times, I thought it was something that you appreciate seeing once but would never want to sit through again. But afterwards, I couldn't get the film out of my mind and when I found that just listening to the musical score was enough to bring back the intense emotions I felt during the film, I knew I had to watch it again, which I have never done in theaters before.I absolutely fell in love with the movie my second time watching it because I was able to fully appreciate the incredible acting, cinematography, score, and everything else that went to crafting this beautiful film. I have rewatched it numerous times since then, but experiencing this film for the first and second time was truly something else...Not everyone reacted to this movie on this level, of course, and it's possible that you will simply like this movie or even dislike it. But that was just my personal reaction."
1504,"Nothing short of what I expected. Hands down the best psychological drama ever made, as best as I recall seeing. I never thought that The Joker could be the hero, that would pretty much make everyone else the villains, but it does happen! He does it! Monumental performance by Joaquin Phoenix.Honestly I thought the script would be brilliant, but it's just about good enough, he makes it seem brilliant! Or maybe JP just embodies perfectly the vision of the screenplay writer, and they're both equally good! I've seen it in something akin HDrip and enjoyed every moment of this movie and I await the Blu Ray release so I can enjoy it again, in more detail!The only way you wouldn't like this movie is if you'd be too much of a child or too stupid for it, as it has the most substance a movie can have, by a fu*king continental drift from the lot! It may be my favorite movie ever, but I have to see it a few more times to be certain! I give it good chances though, I liked him before, but this is the 1st time I truly loved a Joker!"
1505,"There are so many movies out there about the mentally ill man that, if he had been given an ounce of respect and kindness, would not have gone on a killing rampage. Shutter island, Donnie Darko, and The Shining are just a few movies that are so much better than this one with the same exact plot but they weren't boring! The only redeeming factor of this movie was Joaquin Phoenix's outstanding performance."
1506,"The acting, the music, the cinematography, the themes - I could gush for hours about the sheer amount of breath taking QUALITY in this film. If you like good cinema you will like this.""Joker"" stands as one of the most left wing films I have ever seen that persuasively validates left wing theory, which is funny because they are the ones attacking it without having seen it! Cancel culture is stupid isn't it?I felt the crushing weight and pressure of a cold society that did not care about the working class and that favored the elite. I saw a lonely human being kicked until he decided enough was enough and that resistance was not only the best way, but the only way forward.I never felt more revved up to ""fight the power"" and give the middle finger to a corrupt system than after seeing the Joker!The movie doesn't glorify shootings or vigilante justice so much as it makes it clear that if you take away options for people and treat them like they don't matter and don't exist then rebellion and riots WILL HAPPEN. It isn't so much a threat as an inevitability. People need to feel like the game isn't rigged against them to want to play.The way to fix society is to reach out to others more, to be more kind, and to fix the broken corrupt system that lacks humanity and only cares about money.The Joker is a hero for those who society deems garbage and worthless. In the movie there is a protester holding a sign that symbolizes modern-day society and it's connection to this movie perfectly: We are all clowns."
1507,"The direction and script is nothing mediocre. but , joaquin phoenix lift up the film!"
1508,"At first, this film seems to be about how Arthur is the victim of a cruel world. He does have a condition, but Arthur cannot handle life-he is not good at dealing with women, he makes poor decisions (gun at work), and has no self-confidence. And feels the world owes him something, and when he doesn't get it, he murders people.Robert De Niro's character confronts Arthur about his self-pity, and Arthur, unwilling to face his own shortcomings, kills him too. He is actually very similar to any common mass shooter. Arthur is a weak man trying to find strength and relevance.Yes, Arthur's circumstances are bad, but he lives under the same conditions as many others. Yet he is the one that responds by killing people that he doesn't like or that were ""mean"" to him. His social worker in the beginning tells Arthur that society disregards people like the BOTH of them. His neighbor is a single black mother who is dealing with similar circumstances in the same rat infested city, and yet she carries on. Neither of these women went on a killing spree.At the end of the film, the anarchist crown him king. If this movie continued, the masses would realize that Arthur is a self-centered coward that has no agenda other than seeking attention. This movie is an example of fragility at its finest. Joker is a victimizer disguised as a victim."
1509,"Joaquin Phoenix took the movie to next level in last 20 minutes! I just don't need to explain the movie, just think about it
For the first time ever, witnessed audiences were whistling for a villain when he was doing bad things.
Literally, a Masterpiece movie"
1510,"Every scene, every sequence, every beat is just perfect.
This movie would make you look around yourself
Haven't watched it yet....Book tickets now."
1511,Nothing like a regular comic book flick. Nothing like a regular hollywood movie. One of these kinds would come so rarely to theaters. A must watch. Awesome performance by Joaquin makes it feel so.
1512,The whole movie is stunning. The storyline from the beginning to the end is just wonderful. Truly a masterpiece.
1513,This is one of the best or simply THE BEST movie I have ever seen. Acting by Joaquin is phenomenal and the story is simply breathtaking. Its worth every praise and what else can I say. I am MIND BLOWN
1514,"Although I appreciate the actor and settings, I don't know why people keep overrating this boring movie. From the beginning to the end, it proved not to be real comedy, or psycho film. I watched many thriller films like SAW. This film is absolutely no match to those great films. Throughout the movie, you will hardly find time to be excited and mesmerized by the show. It is a waste of my time watching this film with great expectations believing in overrated stars."
1515,Those who are giving this movie 1 or 2 stars they just marvel fans like me but truth must be told this movie is epic brilliant and oscar worthy
1516,"First of all, this has to be performance that could finally land Joaquin Phoenix his long overdue Oscar. He handled the characterizaton almost flawlessly. Fans of Heath Ledger's Joker would surely be proud at Phoenix's performance.The plot is gripping and does not for once drag with time. The supporting cast is brilliant as well while the direction and cinematography are top notch. It's a movie that I wouldn't mind watching again because I know it will still blow me away. Don't miss this!"
1517,"I was so excited about this movie and can not recall when I was this disappointed. This movie is not an accurate dark portrayal of the joker from a different perspective like I hoped. It's a sick pitiful movie that took the enjoyment out of the comic and the character for me. It was boring and instead of getting better, just kept getting worse."
1518,"I judge a movie by how many times I needed to fast forward through it. Joker set a record for me. I spent $6 on Amazon to watch this dull and duller movie. It is painful to see how many people wrote positive reviews. Who are they? What did they see? What did I miss? Yeah, I get the comments on society, etc., but so what?"
1519,"This is a sad and bizarre drama. Not at all a superhero or supervillain movie.If you after 20 min find this boring and hope that soon some DC Comic villain action will commence then stop watching. Because after 1 h it is still the same, and after that a bit more action but not entertaining, just sad and sickening.If I wanted to watch a good drama then I'd choose a true story or a serious real life topic, not this. I can't understand why anyone wants to write a story that is so sad and dark when it is fictional.And why use the Joker's name to sell this? Should be renamed ""Sad weird drama about a nonexistant psychological disorder"". Then see how many users it attracts.."
1520,"Stopped to double check IMDb rating, thought I'd been watching for over a hour but turned out it was just 40 mins. Boring, depressing, could have been a movie without the joker link. Over hyped. Not my cuppa tea."
1521,"As strange a film as you will see, for some this may be a Monet of the film world, but weird is not always wonderful. For myself the film was Ok, I felt the story lacked credibility at times, as a piece of cinematography is will stand up, but the story will not be for everyone."
1522,"I only recently learned that this film was enthralled in some ""controversy"" and felt the need to write a review to support this art. Saw the film in Toronto and I absolutely loved it. I would ignore the perpetually offended outrage mob and recomend this movie to all my friends. I had some slight pacing issues, but overall this is an A+ movie. Will be taking my wife to see it when it's released in my hometown!"
1523,The acting by JP is phenomenal but the disappointment from the movie is that that's the only thing to watch. Now you can understand that even Heath Ledger needed a Nolan and a Zimmer and Howard combo to make it legendary.
1524,This movie told a story. That's all it did. Told a story that didn't need to be told.I actually got up and left since it was so stupid.
1525,"Just bad as in not good.I would like to be able to say more but the movie has no substance in any form.The move is so lacking of any plot that to construct a review, I would need to watch a movie with substans and plot. Joker as a movie has none of this!I can say that having to fill the space for this review is a Joke but, at least it requires a lot more concentration than watching the Joker.This movie is very derivative boring and just the same scene repeated over and over it is very predictable."
1526,"This movie is just another cliched boring time-lost-costing-to-see, in the long lasting Hollywood non-new-ideas run, that had been the trend for too long now. Besides a good acting, Joaquin is a good one, the dance scene with Gary Glitter's song is just insufferable...it's like, ""really?!!! with Gary Glitter?!!"". The petty twists....one after another nonesense....too see it is just a time lost endeavor.
What ever happened to the good cinema, like Tarkovsky's? Or Carpenter's?"
1527,This really was a waist of time to go to the movies!
1528,"If they paid me to watch it, maybe I'll think about it.....
Below average this is kind of movies you put on while you're ironing or doing anything but watching it , to be played in the background just to fill the silence ."
1529,"This movie is so boring, 90% useless stuff, 10% story plot.
Looks like everyone in Gotham is a bad guy who daily beats the Joker. A typical hollywood where the good guy is taken to a back alley, gets beaten up AND in a late night metro a girl is being harassed and our guy gets beaten up again. I see there are a lot of DC fanboys out there who will like anything having their favorite comic character with or without plot. If you like ""Breaking Bad"", ""Interstellar"" etc, this is s***"
1530,This is gonna be the best movie of all time. Mark my words...
1531,The worst comic book movie I've ever seen. If you like seeing Joaquin phoenix dance and laugh then this is the movie for you. I apologize for the spoiler. Two hours of my life lost and wasted. This movie is a form of torture not entertainment
1532,"Have you ever seen one of those low-budget art movies in a small and smelly theater which shows mostly Polish and captioned character-development films? Well, if Joker blew your mind as a very sophisticated movie that deserves a 10-star rating, you obviously haven't. It's simply another one of those films that, for some reason, has been shown in mainstream theaters.
Being fair, it probably doesn't deserve the 1-star, but two or three. The lead actor does a great job. Which was easy in this case, since he already did essentially the same role a couple of years earlier in ""You were never really here"" (2017). A better movie hands down, but because is was not about a comic character and was shown only in one of those smelly theaters, didn't got much attention.
Definitely overrated by people who love the kind of movies that show in smelly theaters and by people who never go there and thus think this is sophisticated and mind-blowing."
1533,"There didn't seem to really be an understandable story. Maybe there was at the end, but by that time I was snoring.Apparently the ending was quite the to-do but the film didn't hold my attention the whole way through. You know it's a bad sign when you are checking constantly to see how much of the film is left.Two hours I'll never get back.Great transformation by Phoenix losing 50+ pounds, but a great movie does take a bit more.To me it was a jumbled, confused, depressing mess."
1534,"JOKER (2019) *** Joaquin Phoenix, Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Francis Conroy, Brett Cullen, Shea Whigham, Bill Camp, Glenn Fleshler, Leigh Gill, Josh Pais, Marc Maron. Interesting but slightly bloated origin story of the arch criminal villain of The DC universe with Phoenix at the top of his game as the much-put-upon Arthur Fleck in Gotham City circa 1981 who reaches his breaking point and a moment of clarity of what his true significant purpose is in life with deadly consequences ensuing. While director Todd Phillips (who co-wrote the screenplay with Scott Silver) attempts to get in touch with his inner Scorsese by paralleling his worldview ala Travis Bickle and Rupert Pupkin (going full meta in even employing De Niro as talk-show host Murray Franklin) with far too many touchstones to count. Phoenix's chameleon-like physicality (shedding over 50 pounds) to give the slightly anemic/skeletal protagonist its spine by tapping into his own Christian Bale ala THE MECHANIC and his eerie, off-settling helpless cackle becomes instantly iconic in the canon of actors who've portrayed this homicidal harlequin."
1535,"Joker is an original movie about the iconic Batman villain of the same name, exploring his origins. It tells the story of Arthur Fleck(Joaquin Phoenix), a man who feels rejected by society.Joker is a mind-blowing film. Director Todd Phillips has given us a one of a kind comic book movie, that delves deep into the psyche of its titular character. What we get is a riveting film with twists & turns, that will leave you guessing, right till the end. Joaquin Phoenix is the star of the show, as Arthur Fleck. Phoenix completely immerses himself in the role & gives us another unforgettable performance. He deserves all the praise, accolades & Oscar buzz coming his way. Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the Joker, matches up to Heath Ledger's legendary performance as the Joker, in The Dark Knight(2008). He also gives us a perfectly chilling 'Joker laugh'. Robert De Niro is awesome as Murray Franklin. Zazie Beetz is spectacular as Sophie Dumond. Frances Conroy is outstanding as Penny Fleck. Brett Cullen is amazing as Thomas Wayne. Shea Whigham, Bill Camp, Glenn Fleshler & Leigh Gill are superb as Detective Burke, Detective Garrity, Randall & Gary, respectively. The supporting cast is excellent. Joker is a must watch for all the fans of one of the best comic book villains of all time. Go for it, as soon as possible!"
1536,"The film is different from anything I've seen before. Normally the villain is part of a hero story - but here everything revolves around the icon of all movie villains. Without giving anything away, this is a must-see movie. But beware, it's the kind of movie where you end up sitting in the seat speechless and thinking: ""What?!??"".Joaquin is great and definitely deserves an Oscar for this outstanding role he plays!"
1537,Basically as the title says .... nothing new here just a psycho clown story that happens to tie into the Batman DC universe ... how many times do we need the Batman story told .... brand names and Hollywood what ever saves them money on marketing .... pathetic
1538,"Saw the movie Joker; it's ok nothing special. It's a weak Taxi Driver with face paint where a drug addict loser blames everybody(white people) for all his failings. Phoenix is great as usual but the movie is just mediocre and actually offensive in its ultra-liberal preaching. Millennials will love it because it reinforces their high school and college teachings that nothing is their fault. Just their parents, their boss, the government, society, their neighbors, the cops, God and everything else but them. That's why it has a 9 on IMDb. because it's superior to The Godfather to this generation. As a movie it is like the Millennials; it is pathetic."
1539,"There is nobody and nothing in this movie to sympathize with, it's boring and utterly nihilistic. Also, many scenes and characters simply do not make sense and only exist so the story can go forward. For example the Trump-like millionaire figure Wayne calling all ordinary people ""jokers"" on TV in a comically condescending way. Or three good-looking white Wall Street guys in suits bullying a woman on the subway and beating up the Joker for intervening.It's just all so stupid. Don't bother."
1540,"So this was well promoted on every social net you could think. So this was told to be the best flick of 2019, So many things were said and so I was afraid it was overhyped.Let me tell you, not one bit. First of all, happy to see Robert De Niro back in a flick that suits him. No more comedies please Robert. Secondly, the comparing all over the net between Ledger and Phoenix. They are both excellent in their own ways.The movie itself. Starts off rather as a normal flick, except for opening credits which took me back to the old WB logo's and yellow lettering of the seventies, but quickly turns into a dark movie getting darker and darker and more and more insane. The way it was shot, the score my God, really well done.And then there's the performance that couldn't beat Ledger. Well, Ledger I do still like as the Joker but what Phoenix did as the sart of the Joker is really really worth the Oscar. The skinny body, the laughter, the sick looks. with De Niro in it it did remind me of Taxi Driver who one person can turn from a desperate person into a mad person.Towards the end I was thinking, okay, so far 10 out of 10 but are they going to ruin the link towards Batman. They didn't, the last 15 minutes, man, it fits perfectly into the Batman world.It's been a while I have seen such a flick, and after some Marvel rather boring stuff (Avengers Endgame for example) again I was shown that DC is my thing.I can go on and on. The impossible mission to beat Ledger, well, the Oscars will proof that it has been done.Be warned, rated 16+, totally correct due the brutal action and the downward spiral of the storyGore 0/5
Nudity 0/5
Effects 0/5
Story 5/5
Comedy 0/5"
1541,"I didnot like that movie, it is invitation for the mess, riot, violence and breaking all the rules
Joakin is good actor, but the content is so bad"
1542,"Such a masterpiece, Joaquín Phoenix will win an Oscar for his performance as Joker."
1543,"Knock, knock.Who's there?A collection of moments from better films shoved together in a half-assed unintelligent, empty, and unnecessarily long waste of time.A collection of moments from better films shoved together in a half-assed unintelligent, empty, and unnecessarily long waste of time who?Joker.Aggressively uninteresting and without a point, this movie just steals moments from other, better movies and doesn't handle them nearly as well. The two main influences are Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, both of which are overrated and yet still much better than this trash.The worries about violence are overblown, mainly because the movie doesn't even have a real point of view. Does it want to be an exploration of someone with a mental health issue? There's only occasionally surface-level rumblings. Does it want to be a villain origin story? We've already had multiple, better origins for Joker. Does it want to be a superhero take on The King of Comedy? De Niro is barely in the film and not realistic in the slightest as a character. Does it want to be a Psycho-esque story of a crazy boy and his crazy mother? It hits all the wrong notes. Does it want to be about a woman who finds out her boyfriend is insane? The neighbor shows up rarely and without logic - there's no reason to have her in the movie at all. Does it want to be a Breaking Bad sort of story of how one man goes bad and starts murdering? He was never good to begin with; the story is almost pointless. Does it want to be a commentary on modern rich v. poor, conservative v. liberal protests and issues? There's nothing remotely close to any substance there, and any relation to the real world is extremely convoluted and poorly thought out.Every plot turn is easily seen a mile away but treated like it needs a huge buildup. All of the relationships are hollow and unearned, the characters being mere pawns for plot machinations that aren't even worth the time. Joaquin Phoenix is great in the role, so I guess there's that."
1544,One of The Best Movies Of All Time.Instant classic.
1545,"This film was exceptionally boring and lacked the intensity of the comic book character. The Joker's story was forgotten and replaced with an excellent portrayal of mental illness. Joker, the beloved villian of insanity, is really only about the last 5 to 10 minutes of the film."
1546,"I can see how Warner Brothers would greenlight something like this in a heartbeat. And it was a box-office smash, so I guess they made the right decision. It's just that Joker is about as shallow as the pitch that must have been used to sell it.Take Joaquin Phoenix put him in a Taxi Driver world, give him a weird mom like Requiem for a Dream. Have the psycho want to be a comedian like King of Comedy. Ooh, ooh let's get DeNiro to play the Johnny Carson part. That'll be clever even though DeNiro is totally wrong for it. And do some kind of Bernie Goetz-but different! And have some kind of V for Vendetta-style revolution where everybody wears clown masks. Freaky huh?The picture goes about connecting these dots dutifully and predictably, accompanied by a two note kettle drum score that represents Arthur getting beaten down deeper and deeper. It also beats on the audience. There are several sequences that are apparently Arthur's daydreams and others that seem like daydreams but apparently aren't. These serve to break up the A to B to C plot and confuse the audience. The uprising happens because the whole town was celebrating a triple murder. But I guess they were protesting income inequality or something. Didn't make sense to me, but I am not part of the 16-34 male, superhero-movie-fan audience that this offering was aimed at.I watched to see Joaquin Phoenix chew the scenery, which he did well, admittedly. And for the 70s sets and cinematography, which were also really good. But that's about all I got out of it. I feel old."
1547,"Despite the best actor win, which I my view is not necessarily deserved, thos movie was a let dow for me. No real intrigue in the story behind the Joker, and predictable. Sorry. I just didn't find it ejoyable"
1548,I wasn 't impressed by the script of the movie or the acting . Everything's already been seen a million times from Hollywood.
1549,"I've tried. I really did, but it's boring. It's contrived. It tries just too hard. I'm not sure what others who have rated this so highly see as perfection, but this just ain't it. It's a sad boring movie that usurped a know character and tried to make it relevant by making it look like a movie I watched on Saturday afternoon on TBS at my grandmother's house.
Phoenix.... I don't know what he's supposed to be doing. DeNiro has become just as pointless and abstract as one of his father's inane doodles.
It's just not a good movie."
1550,A three year old with Gopro camera would have easily made a better movie in the sandbox ..
1551,"Since his chair as part of the official competition of the Venice Festival about a month and a half ago, ""Joker"" has become one of the most controversial, explosive and disputed films of the past decade. On the one hand, he came out of the festival with the Golden Lion and broke a glass ceiling for commercial products based on comic books, defined as a masterpiece by the European critics, and broke the United States in the last weekend. On the other hand, the American media pressed every name for a possible notoriety in the era of political health, director Todd Phillips became the social-boxing bag of societal networks, families of gunshot victims sought to scrap it and security was introduced to some of the halls in which it is screened. At the end of the last weekend, the film immigrated to Israel, and we could also see what the fuss was about.
Let's start with the only simple sentence you can say about the film: he describes the events that we know of the Batman, but this time from the jazz point of view, and tries to explain how the personality of one of the most famous arvillains in the popular culture has been played by Joaquin Phoenix, who went into the big shoes of Jack Nicholson, Heath and others who have done this before.
From here on, it gets complicated. It is easier to say what ""joker"" does not approve what he is. This is a sign that is hung this week in one of the New York cinemas, as part of the overall confusion of the country following the rise of the hit--""attention, please, it is not a comic film in the usual sense of the word, as you are.""
Indeed, ""Joker "" is really not a natural continuation of other successful arrangements for comic books from the last time. Not to Marvel's, and certainly not to those of the DC, whose legacy is based, although it has clear references to previous ""Batman"" movies. If we still have to say why this strange chicken is similar, it is a combination of psychological drama, a dark thriller, and a social satire. It is evident that its contents and style derive inspiration from the ""Taxi Driver"" and ""the King of Comedy"", two of the modern classics that Martin Scorsese created between the late seventies and the early 1980s, a fine and wild time in American cinema, which generally affects the film. Even the scene of his occurrence, the fictitious city of Gutheam at a vague point of time, mentions the cinematic representations of New York in those days, while there was still Sodom and Gomorrah of America.
And what about the man who becomes a gentleman? He suffers from a mental injury, which leads him to tell terrible jokes without being aware of it, and to burst into uncontrollable laughter, which makes him resemble some sort of Hollywood version of Assaf Ashtar at Comedy Store. His livelihood comes from his work as a clown, but even though he wants to make others happy, his hand is perceived as despicable, and brings back humiliation: Already in the first scene, a bunch of youngsters hit him on the street, and at a later stage, Thomas Wayne calls in contempt of ""clowns"" and all those lowlife living in his eyes that are not as wealthy as he is. This statement echoes of course the similar emissions that were made by Mitt Romney and Hillary Clinton during their presidential campaigns against groups in the population, and strengthening the film's topical dimension.
If it is not enough for the hero's troubles, the capitalist elite's policy is leading to cuts in the welfare services and therefore also to the termination of the necessary treatments and the disease. And yet he has more hope: his mother terrorist planted him the faith that came to the world to bring them all a smile on his face, and that he would come out with something big. The open stage of a stand-up comedy club allows it to begin to realize this dream, and from there to bear eyes for the truly great fantasy--a performance in the program of his favorite light-Knight, Robert De Niro, that lihuku here is a wink to the ""King of comedy"", where they played the opposite role of an obsessive admirer of famous comedian (the same Played at the time of Jerry Lewis).
All this makes ""joker"" a smart, complex and relevant film that will be taught at universities and not only in the Department of film, but also mainly in social sciences. In the American media, audits were published that had been enjoyed by the arrogance that it was a foolish piece that was unaware of its meaning. The truth is reversed: there is not a moment here that is not on the banks of irony. If anything, the problem is that the result is so self-conscious that it already has something smug and more pressing.
In the end, the virtues cover up the disadvantages, which is the result that improves as it progresses, and the second part is powerful and even exemplary.
Behind this artistic success are some factors, other than the quality of the script we have already spoken about. First and foremost, the ""Joaquin Phoenix"" game, which officially establishes its status in the pantheon of the greatest, not only in his generation, but at all times. It is hard to think about many other players who were able to play such an extreme character without any phony character, and in a way that would make such a big impression. He is present in the film in almost every moment, carries him on his shoulders with dedication and a total determination, and builds a resting portrait.
On the side of Phoenix, though in a much smaller position, Robert De Niro reminds anyone who forgot what a big player he is. The two of these are the directors of the director Todd Phillips, who are not only in casting and guided by actors but also in all that is related to the scene, creating an atmosphere, placing a camera, editing, combining images into music and so on. Everything here is calculated, meticulous and effective, in everything concerning the picture and everything about sound. So, for example, once in a while we hear the movement of trains above the heads of the characters, which plays a double role: also creates a realistic sense of urban life, and also serves as a metaphor for a storm that is in the consciousness of the hero.
The film depicts a terrible reality: violent, popustic, passionate, hateful and almost merciless. What to do is the world we live in. ""Joker "" does not justify him, but just tries to understand how he was created, and how can I treat decay if you don't understand what his roots are? To me, this film is one of the five best movies I've ever seen, and I'm taking my hat off to anyone who's involved in his work."
1552,"Don't know what to say, this is one great movie. loved every single scene. the actors are really good"
1553,"This movie has it all, ecxept the modern politics propaganda that destroys all movies nowdays.I don't wan't to go in to much on what makes this movie so good i may do a longer rewiev later but for now, I just reccomend you to watch it before you make up your mind..And rest in peace to all movies that have fell vicims on todays nonsense."
1554,"For all of you who think it's terrible, you don't understand the complexity of going isnide of a mental illness and how being violently thorn apart as a child wrecks your psyche, the story starts real slow and slowly escalates, you don't understand how every single line and scene is perfectly thrown together, oh wait you can't your eq is 0(did not mean iq although it's probably low 2), I just want a second movie, and want it as legendary as this one is"
1555,"I've seen it about 3 times now just to try and absorb whatever small bits I kind of left behind. This whole movie is a hot dish served cold.
The whole thing gave off a kind of almost Shutter Island feel in the end, the ""victory was a defeat"" feeling, but artistically... the movie is above and beyond and the way how raw it feels, how much empathy/sympathy it jerked out of me was amazing.In my weird head art is a huge category, where most if not all things fall into the mundane entertainment category, then there's art pretending to be art, then there's Art with a capital A. The kind where those who make it really push it, really make it unique and artistic. This is exactly it, without a shadow of a doubt. A prequel to the whole Batman franchise thay shines like a well polished diamond, so perfect and captivating it feels almost out of place and in a league of it's own. It deserves a long, standing ovation."
1556,"I am in a very small demigraphic of people that while yes this film is competent this film also lacks things such as good characters a plot that keeps it going or anything more complex. The most annoying being how the Joker is portrayed. While there are many interpretations of Joker. This one goes with. 'Oh he's got mental issues' while that's not what makes Joker crazy. This form of chaos that exists to add some spice to the grey void that is life.
The talk show host. Thomas Wayne. His mom. Are main characters of sorts but i'm not given any reason to care for them. Joker's You get what you f--king deserve moment. Is just so funny because it makes so little sense. I would say almost this film is trying to take Mr. Robot elements and morph them with the joker to get something new. And while it is new it isn't a movie. More of social commentary. Which at times is forced down your throat about how. The big guy doesn't care about us.
Joker being kicked around and going on a murder spree isn't this act of liberation. With the end scene it feels like a school shooter story. With a guy with anger issues fighting back at those who hurt him. He's now just an angry teenager especially with the last mind."
1557,"A tragically depressing portrayal of life in the street's of Gotham by Phillips and a phenomenal performance by Phoenix combine to create a haunting story of one man's fall from despair into darkness. A compelling character study which raises the bar. Films like this are rare treasures, so make sure to see it when you get the chance!"
1558,"This is my fav movie of 2019, i loved everything about it. i am sure most of you heard this is not your typical comic book action flick so don't go expecting tons of action, if you do then i am sorry to say this may or may not be for you."
1559,"Dc studios has been making bad movies since the dark knight series (which was great) ended until now! Joker is amazing, it's dark , deep but somehow through all this depression it's actually funny (in some scenes)! People who find this movie boring and don't like it are just finding something to take their anger out on! If you find this movie boring then you probably won't like a lot of other movies, the shawshank redemption for example (its the top rated film of all time)! Joker is a masterpiece that blurs the line between reality and fiction, it's a serious movie with a serious message and I loved every last part of it! Defiantly a 10/10, I would recommend watching this."
1560,"I feel all the DC fan base is just throwing a 10 at this film because its DC and arguably the best DC villain.For me the film was a bit long winded and boring, pheonix was great by the way but i feel the film could of been better. Not a patch on the likes of the dark knight."
1561,"Joanquin's best ever performance. And this is a brilliant, empathetic movie."
1562,"Really drives home the effects of mental health and bullying.
Beautifully made film, double Oscar winners and well deserved best actor for phoenix."
1563,The beginning seems slow and dismal but it's supposed to. It's showing you how the joker was created and the monolgue it builds up to is worth the wait. I genuinely cried.
1564,Joaquin phoenix Best actor in the world .. he is extraordinary man .. how can i explane .. u have to watch that movie ...
1565,"Acting, story, photography, music everything is so dawn well done.
And by the way that Joker laugh is amazing !!!"
1566,Philosphical approach and giving a viewer an insight how an innocent and troublesome mind can go mad. You feel the pain and anger in the justifications of actions performed in this masterpiece. Giving a morally complex and paradoxical taste of the jokers mind.
1567,"Best comic book movie EVER hands down. The performances here are fabulous, as is the directing, soundtrack and story. Watch this!"
1568,"It'll be boring if I'm just gonna talk about how this movie is great, so I just leave it here."
1569,"Well, I see a lot of people complaining about this movie that it isn't reasonable because they don't understand the movie. It isn't necessary that you don't find a movie logical so it's a bad movie. Really I feel sorry for those people or simply haters. People fears or hates what they don't realize and as for the movie this is just one of those types. This is not your typical movie which will make you laugh, will entertain you in every way possible and in the end will give you a happy ending so that you can make it out of the theater and tell everyone ''it's a great movie'', no it is not that way at all. 'Joker' is something with greater meaning which will make you pointing your own finger at yourself. It is a character study that will make you standing on your feet and applauding if you got the message. I think this is where i might cut it short, here is a simple suggestion, go to the hall and watch the movie. Not to forget about 'Joaquin Phoenix' you just did a hell of acting right there. A well deserving movie which isn't meant for everyone."
1570,"What are folks going on about and giving this a 10 that's ridiculous.
It's mediocre-at-best I will admit Phoenix, his performance is melancholy and ferocious.
But I've come to expect the best from Joaquin.
I was loaned this from a neighbor, I am so grateful that I didn't go out and spend hard-earned dollars on this product.
My favorite collateral superhero comic book character is Batman and I prefer the Chris Nolan Batman.
it was slow and dragged in parts. Robert De Niro was superfluous
I also borrowed a little lesser-known flick called Lighthouse with William Dafoe much more satisfaction."
1571,"And I think nearly everyone who watched in cinema did. It look like a masterpiece.
The second time you see it... well.
The cinematography is still there, great as the first time. And Joaquin Phoenix is still terrific. But the script... The. Script. And the characters aside Arthur...I think the whole problem was (and still resides) on the hype before the movie, with the release of those trailers, who promised a dark, grounded-in-reality, very diferent tone for an origin story about the Joker (also the 8-minute ovation in the Venice Festival thing). The movie finally came out, and people saw a dark, grounded origin story like no other DC or Marvel film, just what the trailers promised. The rest is history; ""It's a masterpiece"".The truth is, that there is nothing more. We get what the trailers promised, a darker tone movie compared with the rest of superheroe-genre movies, but there is nothing that movie wants to talk about, no seriously at least: What does the movie says? At the end, Joker rises while the city of Gotham burns. Yeah, you could say that its thesis is ""Mental illness afects everyone if we, as a society ignores it."". But since the people responsable of creating Joker are two dimensional characters who are hardly real, that message falls apart (along with other problems).There are a lot of other things that don't quite work, but people alredy talked about it at some point. What I'm trying to say is that Joker is far from the masterpiece people praised it was the moment they leave the cinema. I was one of them, too. There's good in this movie, of course. But a movie is beyond the first impresion.I give it a 7/10. A flawed movie, who gave me (and most of us) a really nice moment at the cinema who I will never forget."
1572,"Very unique story cinematography is amazing, Story is of a normal man who struggle in his entire life for making a good career in comedy but he took the other way in his life."
1573,"It doesn't need a film critic to praise how superior is this movie to many comic book character movie. Phoenix delivers a performance worth of an academy award and Phillips delivers a complete and mesmerizing story. Much MORE than any dumb, empty, and CGI-filled story produced with a joke each 5 minutes (yes, I'm talking about you MCU). Joker definitely worth a thousand views. Well done."
1574,"This is a story about essence. Essence where emotions, mentality and society forces a man to change himself into a dark sided character.
This is about how a poor low class man becomes one of the world's highly rated comic criminal, known as the Joker. It is a beginning into the batman movie and series, and is a must see for all comic/batman fans.Put on a smile and, watch the movie. 😁"
1575,"I can understand why some people would not like it. The pace was slow. There were moments that would make the audience saying ""What?"", kinds of like playing games. However, the movie on the whole was a powerful one. We were basically in his head most of the movie. We saw what he sees, and this guy was a walking time bomb. He had many sign of trouble, lack of confidence, self insecure, and loneliness. Because the problem was not treated, he went spiraled down. He could be a metaphor for many brewing problems, like he could be Hong Kong since the Tiananmen Square massacre when the city got traumatized for those who know the history of the city. Despite the slow pace, I thought it fitted perfectly his inner struggle and his mental breakdown. The setting was outstanding, and needless to say the performance. Hard to say if I still like it on another viewing, but at this moment it is one of the best movies I have seen from 2019."
1576,"Simply put, an absolute masterpiece! In fact, it's so good, that I would place this film in my top 10 of all time. Joaquin Phoenix must get an Oscar for his performance, to say it was sublime is an understatement. From start to finish, I was mesmerised by the cinematography, music, characterisation (Joker) storyline, and the ending!A breathtaking film!"
1577,"I won't say much because it might ruin it for others but I can safely say this is one of my favourite movies of all-time and only once before have I given a movie 10 stars and that was ""Saving Private Ryan"". It will be criminal if Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win Best Actor at the Academy Awards and this movie has to win Best Movie. I've already watched it twice. The plot and the acting are second to none. I just can't get over how good it was. Hopefully a sequel is in the works. There is so much they could do with this character and this story."
1578,"The first thing about movie is direction
Second acting
And third is music.
This is the best movie of the year. phoenix was so perfect.i love the it"
1579,"Wow, amazing acting from Phoenix as usual. Taxi Driver and Seven vibes, with noir NYC atmosphere. Great musical score and an important commentary on mental illness and child neglect."
1580,This movie is serious. Having a joker like that sure makes me happy. I wish we will be up for a sequel
1581,"Honestly, I wasn't initially expecting this movie to be this good. Like it's really good. This is a combination of amazing scripting coupled with a brilliant cast. This movie clearly beats my expectations considering the fact that I was never a fan Joker himself. However, this movie brought the character into a different light, and focused on how he became Joker. A must see!"
1582,"Had never been in a movie twice. this one stole my heart and left me speachless for an hour and a half both times. a masterpiece. best movie i've ever seen. I breaks you to pieces and builds you up, it leaves you questioning your own emotions, feelings and beliefs, also questioning society as a whole. You're laughing and crying at the same time, you don't know who should be justified and who do you trust. You start thinking you're a little Joker yourself. Absolutely loved it. Movie of the decade, no doubt."
1583,Trying to catch every bit that I'd missed . So tense and entertaining. Simply beautiful and amazing.
1584,"It's one of the best actings which all would have witnessed.
Even though there isn't much of the story ratings are purely for the acting"
1585,"I have waited so long to see a film that affirmed a blockbuster can take risks, be bold, clever and captivate you in a way that I haven't experienced in so many years. What a masterpiece. I'm still pulling parts of the film apart in my head weeks later. Stroke of genius and if Joaquin Phoenix doesn't take every award in existence this year there is something wrong in the system."
1586,When i watched this movie i just think about who's better(joaquin or heath ledger)but i'm pretty sure now joaquin is the best person who can play as joker
1587,"Perhaps bias, perhaps not, but what a movie. I haven't seen many movies from Joaquin Phoenix apart from Gladiator, so not knowledgeable about his abilities as an actor. But I am pretty sure after seeing this performance that he ranks amongst the best at this time.I was a huge fan of Heath Ledger in the last great Joker appearance (lets forget the Suicide Squad) in Dark Knight, but I'm considering this to be even better. Better because Joaquin and director Philips, never attempted to emulate that Joker, but installed a completely new version of him. A man driven to madness. The expression on Joaquin's face is so intensive and plain scary.The cinematography, the fitting music, the original Joker theme, gotta gotta give Todd the kudos, Oscar worthy at least. As I understand it, he was as amazed at Joaquin's performance as most of the movie loving audience.The last 30 minutes of the film were exceptional. Multiple violent scenes, leading up to his appearance on De Niro's tv show (great acting here as well on De Niro's part), the shocking finale, the rise of the Joker as anti hero and the last scene which will be debated until the next instalment of the Joker (2).Dear movie lovers, if you can handle violence, if you can appreciate great acting and love musical scores, see this movie on the big screen while you still can. you won't regret it."
1588,"Unquestionably the most sensational autobiography on a villain I've seen to date. Joker is masterful in almost every aspect, but most importantly, able to truly focus on the inner workings of perhaps the most well-known in the superhero realm. The best part of the film is that it is not dumbed down to suit the fanboys, it is done in a mature and art-house way to influence and inspire the audience. Joaquin Phoenix delivers an Oscar level performance that is one for the ages. Also love the uncertainty of every scene, the constant questioning of what is real and what is not. The eccentricity of the character does not feel forced, it conjures a sort of sympathy from the audience throughout the film. Every scene, every movement and every dialogue felt sinister in a poetic way.Not sure if the DC Universe can follow suit after this, but I think they should leave this as an independent work. Felt the last scene with Thomas Wayne is somewhat unnecessary and broke the mood a little."
1589,"I never bothered to watch this when it was first released. Thought this was another over hyped piece of garbage.
I was so wrong. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Joaquin is brilliant.
Nothing more to add to all the reviews. Just watch it."
1590,Everything about Joker is Masterpiece especially Joaquin Phoenix legendary performance.
1591,"Absolutely loved the dark and moody feel this film generated.
A perfect film"
1592,"Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is unquestionably one of the darkest yet incredibly powerful and important pieces of cinema in recent years. Reactions have ranged from wholly irresponsible, to mean spirited. However, one which is not particularly explored is its seeming importance in an age of which Gotham's societal issues seem much like any other western city. To say that Joker is a microcosm of today's society would not be much of a stretch - in fact it would be pretty accurate.Gotham is in-turmoil, as a consequence of strikes its streets are littered with rubbish, the rich are getting richer, budgets are getting cut and seemingly the powers to be have no interest or do not deem mental health to be of importance; sound familiar? Within this toxic, cruel and bitter city Arthur Fleck (Joker, Joaquin Phoenix) a troubled and struggling comic suffering from severe mental disorders has to go about his daily life and make sense of his own reality. After finding out his mental health treatments will be cut and the state will no longer provide funds for his medication he is left to fend for himself.To say that the comic to movie trick has run its creative course would be an understatement. In-fact, to say that Marvel and DC have squeezed every last penny out of each generic, painstaking superhero franchise would be a lie - because there is undoubtedly another one coming out next week (even if you are reading this in 2035). Having said that what director Todd Phillips alongside writer Scott Silver have managed to accomplish is to reinvent (yet again) what a comic book character can embody and stand for. Director of the Hangover movies and Due Date (although good comedic movies in their own right) Phillips' rebirth is perhaps the biggest surprise to 2019. Each and every element of Joker is perfectly on point, and Phillips' envision of what a Joker movie should entail is clearly brought to life. Phillips' depiction of the Joker's world is awesomely dark and that darkness transpires through its spectral score, glum environment and intense visual acting.Joaquin's Joker is truly his own, in which the brilliant script and plot gives him the freedom to do so. His desperate, insidious undertones are apparent throughout, of which occasionally becomes satisfyingly uncomfortable. From his uncontrollable laughing fits to his existential dance routines this is one obscenely creepy guy. Compassion or sympathy are not words that spring to mind when describing the Joker; rather pity. Pity for his intolerably unfortunate set of circumstances in that he is left to his own devices to tackle his awful existence without the support or help from anyone.Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is eerily beautiful in all the ways it should be, bordering on uncomfortable at times this film rides the cusp perfectly. Always leaving you second guessing, each scene feels as though it is improvised (in a good way) and it is truly impossible to predict which way each set piece will go. Each scene contributes seamlessly to the overall narrative that Phillips is trying to convey, it's with-strained and outright outlandish when required. It seems that the Joker has raised a few heads and its controversial undertones might just mean it misses out on best picture. However, for its sheer audacity it should certainly be in contention."
1593,Joaquin Phoenix's performance illustrates what mind-blowing acting should be like. Director Todd Philips mostly known for his comedies has just shown us that he can really do anything as the cinematography and music in Joker was just phenomenal. This is why I give the film a 10/10.
1594,"Thank you very much to the creators of ""Joker"" (2019). You have so accurately and beautifully portrayed the torment, anguish, and rage of an adult survivor of childhood trauma. I adore this film--it made me feel understood and not so alone. It is truly brilliant--a masterpiece and my favorite film of all time. I hope you take the Oscars by storm."
1595,"This movie is a masterpiece! The acting and character development is one of a kind. Not your typical kid friendly action hero movie (I was hoping it wouldn't be). Instead, it tells the story of a deeply disturbed man and his rise to power. A psychological work of art.A must see!"
1596,One of the best films I've seen in a long time. A beautiful and truly thoughtful piece of work worth watching over and over again.
1597,"Joker made my jaw drop. Joker made my heart raise. Joker gave me hope for the future of cinema.In a society where average after average movie gets pumped out and eaten up, this is a delightful surprise. From a technical standpoint it is absolutely perfect. The script could have been a little bit better, and by a little I mean tiny. I would say it's really about a taste difference and where you want the story to go. I feel that at some parts the tension in some scenes could have been done a little bit better, but after all the tension was great.This movie did a couple of things for me; it gave me hope that there is still great film making out there, that doesn't play for cheap tricks, dumb story lines etc. But instead a movie that takes it self seriously and is also justified to do so. I'm not saying it is the only one of its kind, because a lot of great movies and series have been done in the last years, but it's nice to see a movie like this break box office records. Joker also made me lose whatever respect I still had for ""professional film critics"", never will I again base any decisions on critics reviews.We need more movies that tries and succeeds in tension, beauty, brilliant acting and intelligent story lines. This movie is a masterpiece and I dare say it was one of the best movie experiences of my life, don't miss out."
1598,Well scripted casted directed and performed.. credit to the director todd philips guys a genius.. and 2 cast joaquin pheonix the most underrated actor in hollywood.. A masterstroke.. this is a movie that cinema fans movie fanatics have been yearning for something different and unique look at life from a different perspective.. Best film best actor.. An outstanding contribution to cinema Thank you 😊
1599,"This is the kind of movie you only see once per decade or so and realize that you are watching a future classic/masterpiece of art.
J.Phoenix is hypnotizing to watch and deserves two Oscar statuettes if that was possible for his performance as Arthur/Joker.
Also Todd Phillips deserves an Oscar for both the directing and the writing of this movie.
A true masterpiece and a must watch. Speechless for any other word to describe this movie. 10/10!"
1600,"I was blown away by the phenomenal performance of Joacquin Phoenix, absolutely top acting !!"
1601,"When I saw the magnificent Heath ledger a few years a go in his excellent role as a joker I doubted that any one can make such an amazing performance as Heath did .
Years after Heath tragic death 💔 that break our hearts Joaquin Phoenix bring the tears into our eyes again for this masterpiece , I can't really find the words to describe how Phoenix was great , the cinematography is absolutely amazing the music is outstanding,
I know that Phoenix is a great actor especially in his beautiful role in HER but actually in his new role as ajoker I think he put a new standard out there and I doubt that it will be some years before any one could reach it"
1602,"Outstanding performance by Phoenix, amazing character development... one of the best movies I have seen in a while..."
1603,"I can't believe that this just an act or just a movie
Joaquin Phoenix deserves the oscar"
1604,"THE BEST MOVIE AND BEST ACTING PERFORMANCE EVER!!!
COULD NOT TAKE MY EYES OFF OF THE SCREEN
WRAPPED INSIDE THE OMINOUS FEELING OF HEAVINESS AND EMPTINESS"
1605,"K this was an incredible work of art, not gonna beat around the bush. Jauquin pheonix is giving a career highlight here, it might be even better than his performance in the master but I'll have to think about that. Tod philips and cinematographer Laurence shaper have made a beautifully shot movie, and the shot length really gives pheonix and De Niro room to act. The camera work itself is also very well done, but its not the type off camera work that calls attention to itself like that of Paul Thomas Anderson or Martin Scorsese. The blending of reality and fantasy and reality is also extremely well handled, I'm not gonna give spoilers but I will say that its kind of like American psycho and middle school:the worst years of my life (does anybody's remember that book?). It is important to mention that this movie is not for everyone, it is violent and intense, but that being said its not as violent as other art house movies like drive or hereditary. No, its not really the violence as much as the intensity and the emotion that the film evokes, which is most certainly not a complaint its a great aspect of the film. Cinifix's 10 most emotional movie moments has 2 slots in it that focus on second hand embarrassment or cringe and deep uncofortable-ness and I'd say about 87 percent of the film are squarely in those 2 spaces. Overall this movie in its own special way is a masterpiece, even if its not at all easy to watch."
1606,"This is the masterpiece that no one can make without so many things coming together, to create a tale that have been attempted countless times, but the best version is manifested now.Joker can be seen as an origin story, or an independent story in Batman universe, or an independent movie in our world, and it will do justice to every point of view.If Ledger made Joker the biggest villain amongst all, Phoneix has made him something beyond the very identity that Joker has, he is not a villain in the strictest sense of the word, instead he is the victim, very much like his arch-nemesis and the biggest superhero of all time.I'd go on writing and my current emotions wouldn't be able to dig it all, so I'd just say thanks DC to attempt this, and wish them best to make the first billion dollar plus R-rated film."
1607,"Great acting, awesome atmosphere, fantastic music and an all great round film. I've never reviewed a film before but I found this film to excel my expectations despite taking a different direction to what I was expecting."
1608,Perfect and joker 2019 is very good thank you very much
1609,"Very heavy movie. Looked in one breath.I am a reviewer, but I can't find the words. Simple, high quality, hard, smart. Becoming a villain from a harmless person. Society is to blame. Always.Watch everyone!"
1610,"The Joker may be the most important movie of this decade. This film isn't trying to cash on political correctness, virtue signaling, or any form of baiting. Yet, the film makes a powerful commentary about our modern society. The protagonist is a surprisingly relatable monster who you would root for and understand, and actually would make you believe he got the moral high ground. Beautifully shot, beautifully written, and with a truly spectacular performance by Joaquin Phoenix, this is a film worth watching over and over."
1611,Absoultey amazing. Definitely in the top 10 must watch movies ever
1612,"Oscar winning performance from Phoenix, the film gets into the fabric of the Jokers madness, and his intelligence. Great cinematography and scene formation. Great supporting sound track. Sorry to the haters, but this is up there. Enjoy!"
1613,"Saw it yesterday and it is still replaying in my head. Loved every minute of it.
The acting was phenomenal. In some scene Joaquin was conveying several emotions at the same time with total surrender and believability. I was just in awe to see a human do this. That's acting on master level. At the same time you saw this very fragile looking human being a victim of his illness and environment and on the other this incredibly strong will (insanity ?) shining through. The cinematography was just amazing. I was drawn into this dark depressing environment but with such a visual clarity and details. I almost forgot the music. There was this cello music emphasizing dark insanity coming out drawing you further into the scenes. And during the action scenes some very fitting songs were started in perfect synchrony. Great.
One of the best movies I have ever seen. A real masterpiece."
1614,Grate movie I can watch this movie for 100 times everyday.. It's the greatness of acting..
1615,"What an incredible movie. One of the very few films that I have seen at the cinema... and as the credits role I just sit there, open mouthed! Brilliant."
1616,"Super thought provoking film and WOW what a performance from Joaquin Phoenix, just WOW!"
1617,"It was pretty clear from before the movie got released that despite being a central comic book villain, Joker would not be anywhere along the lines of any superhero/super villain film we've ever seen. Instead of having the clown of Gotham going on a mad rampage to burn down the city, we witness an origin story for Joker : a story of how a normal if not slightly delusional person on being bogged down by society can turn into an uncontrollable, cold-blooded madman that we all know of.Joker's alter ego Arthur Fleck's struggles makes it immensely relatable and it is amazing to watch the character develop throughout the film. Joaquin Phoenix never fails, delivering a strong performance and proving that he is one of the best, most devoted method actors in the industry.Joker rides on a simple plot fueled by a cast of extraordinary actors and a spine-chilling soundtrack which goes perfect with the protagonist's actions. With a couple of gory scenes, the movie can feel a bit heavy to handle. The movie, with beautiful cinematography ,successfully captures the essence Prince Clown of Gotham!"
1618,This is the movie that makes you unsatisfied. Unsatisfied because you don't wanna stop the screen presence of Joaquin till the end of the movie... and even after.. Masterpiece 😎
1619,"The best movie i have ever seen in my life,honestly this movie shows real things with the best way possible.Good work DC continue like that STRONG!!!"
1620,I don't remember the last time I was so emotionally attached to a movie. This is one of the best movies I've ever watched and I'm so happy I got a chance to see it in a theatre. Perfect.
1621,You do not leave the same person after seeing the Joker.
1622,"This was easily the best movie I have seen in so long. It is pure art from the beginning to the end. From the camerawork, to the plot, to the acting, this movie is far better than any of the junk on the market right now. It's worth Every single penny trust me. So good. So good. Sweet Caroline so good. Enjoy this once in a. Lifetime experience boys and girl/z. You won't regret it mwah"
1623,My only issue with the movie is the lack of this line
1624,"The film is one of the most beautiful films that I have seen for the actor, the great Jokaine Phoenix. The sequence of events and the soundtrack is fantastic"
1625,This is one of the best movies ever made in my opinion. I got chills when i left the cinema. I absolutely recommend this movie for everyone!
1626,"But, my new favorite movie ever. Its an absolute must-watch. I made an account just to make this review."
1627,"This should have been the title of the movie. This is by far... the best ""the making of"" film in movie history yet.For a character that is well known and one that everyone has an opinion off, no one definitely knows how this character came to being. This version of the character development is by far the best version so far, for so many reasons.For one. Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant in this role. He embodies the very essence of what the joker has been through, through the ages, to become who he is.The script and direction of this movie is brilliant. It even gives glimpse into the very reality of why the Gotham universe is the way it is. There are so many moments in this movie that makes one realise the universe of Gotham and Batman, Of why they lead to certain events.For those batman fans who grew up reading the comics... you're in for a real treat! The screenplay and direction is superb in telling a story of the joker that develops its roots of what makes him over the edge, while also dropping crucial points on what could influence the becoming of other characters. ... things a lot of us have never realised were even connected.I can't wait for batman now and I truly can't wait for the next time batman and joker meet in this universe created by Todd Phillips. Here's hoping they do, coz I truly can't wait to see the outcome knowing what I know now, about their becoming.This is truly a film not to miss, for those new to the genre but truly love movies of substance and character, and for those who truly love the Batman universe. Go watch it now!"
1628,"I think after ledger, that every great actor wants to play this part, todd phillips asked joaquin and here whe are!
a briljant movie... will be blowing minds for a long time...nuff said"
1629,"There is so much that can be said about this spectacular film. Those who call it boring or dismiss it for being too violent are doing their best to quantify a piece of art they are not able to completely understand. Ennui only comes through disinterest and emotional/intellectual distance. The subtleties of Phoenix's performance to some, are undercut by his denial that he did not have to give himself to the role as much as previous Jokers have had to. People want a story of struggle and pain ending with high accomplishment. But the actor achieves this with skill and mastery of his craft. I'd watch the film again and again just to enjoy how Phoenix deftly makes be believe and empathise with a sociopath, a victim of circumstance in this interpretation.Brilliant cinematography and self-conscious homages to classic Scorsese masterpieces are testament to the wider scope Joker seeks to reach. The public seem so worried about how this film could incite violence and negative behaviour. My appreciation for the artistic calibre of this film resides it its ability to incite such controversy and opinion. Instead of shouting at the screen ask yourself why you feel the way you do and question your own tendencies rather than seek to project your insecurities on the world. What a film!"
1630,"There have been many a Joker - from live action adaptations and animated adaptations - and this one, by Joaquin Phoenix, is the best one next to Heath Ledger's Joker. With this film released late in the year, perhaps Phoenix is a shoo-in for Best Actor. An excellent character study of a man battling a plethora of mental illnesses. Also, for those who have seen this movie, one question remains: How much of the movie is rooted in reality, and how much of it is in Arthur Fleck's mind? It's difficult to differentiate reality from fantasy."
1631,"The character development in this film is amazing. Reflecting on the person you saw at the beginning of the film and at the end are so totally incomparable. Heath Ledger set a high bar, and this film was a fantastic and different take on a story. It was totally gripping - one of those films you talk about for 2 hours solidly after seeing."
1632,"Pure art, pure masterpiece. Unconventional brilliance, you have to see it and feel it.
I'm left speechless ..
Thank you!"
1633,"Now this is why i keep going forward in life because of films like this masterpiece with a true message and by far Phoenixe's best role, some great acting and him and ledger are good in their own way.Definitely a well made jokers origins story, i couldn't ask for it better, everything about it, the cast, picture, action and the plot were fantastic and definitely sets up Christopher Nolans magnificent Batman franchises."
1634,"It must have been a daunting task for Joaquin Phoenix to play such a complex depressed character and still manage to live up to the iconic role of Joker.I understand why many have misunderstood this movie, I have too. I saw it without having much sleep the night before and that is why I didn't grasp what was really being unveiled before my eyes.This is the kind of movie that requires full attention from start to finish. If you are the type to have your nachos, check your phone or even go to the toilet in the middle of a movie then just pass on this movie altogether and save everybody the half hearted critique.I have no idea how some have rated this 1. I mean even in my first visit, with my misunderstanding, it still was a good movie, just didn't realise HOW good!Only after my revisit, have I realised that I am witnessing the emergence of a timeless classic. Its too much to take in. No movie in the past decade has managed to break into the top 20 rated movies of all time( IMDB)( With the exception of Inception ). Joker has danced his way into the big leagues with ease.The writing is perfectly woven from start to finish. Everything in the movie adds up. It is a really depressing movie, a wake up call to those looking to wake up.The 1 star ratings given to this movie are by the ones who enjoy sleeping I guess, or just too scared to face the misery of reality outside the borders of their beds.This movie is just too much to comprehend. Your emotions will be tackled, your sympathy will be questioned, and your morals will definitely be in check.We don't live in this world alone, but many of us rather live pretending to.
The symbolism is refreshing and the lessons are intimidating.
It is a major mistake to compare Heath Ledger's Joker to Joaquin's. The plot and genre of both movies are totally different. Dark Knight's Joker was a cool, diabolic mastermind, a savage genius, full of charisma and dark humour. Not to take anything away from Heath's legendary performance, but the writing of Dark Knight, along with the sequence of events , really helped catapult Heath Ledger's Joker to an unprecedented summit. Imagine Heath Ledger playing the Joker with my writing? ... Exactly.Both actors have mastered their portrayal of Joker in their own way. No comparison is valid.Both actors have shown the dark side of the Joker.Joaquin was just too dark, too much.I have read somewhere that a critic said something on the lines of "" the world is not ready for a movie like Joker"", well spot on. Might I add, the world is a circus and Joker is the elephant in the room.
Lets just enjoy the fact that there are two Jokers in the top 20 rated movies of all time.This is the kind of movie you would want to watch again and again and again. Not because you're insane, but because the world is, and your sanity is just too precious.Joke UhOne last point:SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILERMy take on the final Crash scene:When mental healthcare is trivialized or overlooked ,(Ambulance)Security becomes in jeopardy (police)And in turn,People will find it hard to move around(Taxi)And society will ultimately become paralysed.Finally,Don't forget to smile."
1635,"Peter Bradshaw of the Guardian has got be the worst film critic on the planet!
How did he ever get a job doing this.
He is clueless.
Ignore his review .
This is a brilliant piece of film making"
1636,At loss of words. Legacy of Heath has continued finally someone picked up where he left. Wow what a performance. I can still hear the laugh.
1637,"This film is definitely a masterpiece. This is probably the most realistic film I've seen since The Dark Knight. The color grading, the soundtracks, the costumes, and overall EVERYTHING is phenomenal. Truly an Oscar Worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix, Robert De Niro, and others. This film mainly depicts on mental illness, rich vs poor, and what would happen to a person if society doesn't treat him/her well. NO JOKE YOU SHOULD WATCH THIS FILM!!!"
1638,"This movie is astonishing,
This movie managed to tie all loose ends. The outstanding acting makes the movie so much more believable and realistic, and every character is designed perfectly and have major role in the plot.
The camera shots in this film are perfect, mostly wide blurred shots slowly creeping in making it so much more disturbing.
Plot - This movie is so disturbing and gritty just as it should be, it shows what really can happen in life when a person with mental health issues or even a healthy person that has hit rock bottom and has no one to help them 'back' up.The message is perfect for the times we live in, in 2019, the rich and healthy should not be separated from the sick and poor; from the mentally challenged. We should live in a society where anyone can be helped and anyone can be heard no matter what level they stand at, before they spiral."
1639,"After the credits started rolling I sat in my chair thinking is this real? Did they really make such a movie? Are they even capable of making movies like this? This is easily the best movie I have watched in God knows how many years. Oh, and Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar"
1640,"I rarely write reviews but I felt the need to write one for this movie just to tell everyone that it doesn't even nearly live up to its hype. Yes, the actor's performance is undoubtedly amazing and he deserves an Oscar, but the movie itself was kind of boring. The whole time you know what is going to happen, there is nothing, and I mean nothing, that is unexpected about the plot. It is a movie charged with so much negative energy that you end up leaving the theater being emotionally drained. It has a good message though but so do many other movies as well. The only reason why I gave the movie 7/10 and not 5 or 6 is because the actor truly did a good job.
After this movie, I can only hope that Robert Pattinson's Batman will contain not only good acting but good writing."
1641,"Joaquin Phoenix was amazing. I wanted to give him a standing ovation at the end of the film. If he doesn't get all the awards for best actor next year, people will probably riot on the streets with clown masks on.I have to say, the setting, cinematography, music, the acting were all so brilliant. Although I understood why some of the critics gave a bad review, especially on how the film makers drew inspiration for Martin Scorsese's past films, this movie was exceptional in its own way.The only thing I thought of after finishing the film was how the plot was a bit basic. However, everything else was just too good!!Must see of 2019! Also I hope there won't be a sequel, let this beauty become a legendary standalone film, PLEASE!"
1642,"JOKER 2019Joaquin Phoenix, Todd Philips & Scott Silver's JOKER is the ULTIMATE punchline to the 'joke' called society. It is a bold, raw, devastating and hauntingly beautiful character study, a social commentary and a flawless masterpiece - a cinematic achievement in the 100 years of cinema. It unfolds very very slowly but as it does, it punches you in the guts, punches you hard.Let me go back to one and a half year or more ago when they announced the movie. Being a hardcore Joker fan, I wasn't overly excited as I knew (as did everyone) that it is not possible to outdo Heath Ledger's performance as Joker. I was still intrigued as I heard Martin Scorcese was involved and Joaquin Phoenix was cast as the role with Robert De Niro in it. I wanted that different, crime-driven version. Then, over the course of last 12 months LOTs and LOTs of leaked photos and behind-the-scenes footages came out, and I wasn't quite liking what I saw. The production team seemed lazy as per security and keeping secret, something someone like Christopher Nolan wouldn't do. Then I heard that the script was being rewritten almost every day (which is usually a recipe for disaster) and my expectations were further down and it wasn't even my most anticipated this year, then there was the matter of confidence on Director Todd Philips who directed the crime-driven comedy 'The Hangover'. THEN, the unexpected happened and we got to see the first trailer and the second. And then, last month, the reviews came in, the movie won an 8 minute standing ovation from Venice Film Festival screening and won the 'Golden Lion'. Some of the hardest reviewers gave it full marks and called it either a masterpiece, or a cinematic achievement, or that a comic book movie has never been done in such way, and this opens up new doors and changes the movie industry forever. Well....whatever you heard and read are all true.Joaquin Phoenix gave a performance that cannot be described in words, even if I talk about it in person I will fail to describe it. I have never seen any performance like this, and I watch a LOT of cinemas. He did something impossible to the character that left us all awestruck and in disbelief. His version of Joker is of course different (the greatness of Joker character is - it is multi layered and can be approached in different ways) but if I'd have to compare it, it goes on par with Heath Ledger's Joker or maybe even outshines him. If I consider the best actors (Oscar Winners) for the last few years namely, Matthew Mcconaughey, Mahershala Ali, or Rami Malek, they were all brilliant but Phoenix outshines them all (little known fact, Phoenix did almost all his shots in single takes :O). Joaquin Phoenix has BECOME Joker. My sincere gratitude to Todd Philips, as whatever rewrites and plans he did, it came out as a beautiful bright art. It took him a whole year to convince Warner Brothers to greenlight the movie and 5 visits to Joaquin Phoenix's house to convince him. His depiction of Gotham city is raw, filthy and perfect. Cinematography also is Oscar worthy and so is the story. Hildur Guðnadóttir's unforgettable score for the movie not only is a perfection but it almost literally talks to you during moments, especially during times when you're confused as to what is going on inside Arthur Fleck's (Joker) mind.Joaquin Phoenix's Joker will sadden you, cheer you, scare you, haunt you, and finally leave you scarred. Yes this movie is not for everyone and of course children should definitely avoid it. In the end, you will not know how much of it you can believe or was real, it leaves you to your imagination. So if you think this Joker has a definitive origin as opposed to Heath Ledger's mysterious Joker.....wrong, it leaves you to interpret it on your own way. When there is chaos we always try to point it all to someone, in JOKER though you wouldn't know whether you should point you finger to the society or Joker himself. When everything spirals out of control do you still endure it, or do you cross that thin line, or do you put a bullet through your head, what would YOU do given the same situation, because Arthur Fleck is one of us. Therein lies the mastery of the movie. During the final punchline of it you will roar as we all did - WE ARE ALL CLOWNS, LET'S PUT ON A HAPPY FACE.As Arthur would say ""I used to think my life was a tragedy, now I know it's a comedy"", apart from what this line represents, the final shot of the movie ends with a comedy. This movie will win multiple awards and Oscars as per my prediction and will be talked about for years. Indeed, one of the greatest cinematic achievement created with a $ 55 million budget. Don't wait for blu-ray, run to the theaters and believe me, it is worth every single penny of yours. This movie is disturbingly real, and relatable.I've seen it 3 times already and still stuck with the HAHAs in my head. I'm giving it a 10/10."
1643,Watched Joker in the cinema a couple of hours ago and am still processing it. It's not the movie you expect but rather way better than you would expect. You won't feel happy watching this movie as the story is about a struggling man. The acting and bizarre movement of Arthur is just perfect. This is a must watch as it will most likely make you feel the need to process what you just experienced.
1644,"I just saw the movie for the second time, and i'm gonna go watch it for the third time and even a fourth time.This movie is amazing, everything in this movie is incredible. It really deserves an oscar."
1645,"Best Movie of the year. A must see for all cinema fans. Joaquin's performance is mind blowing. Joker is ""the rare comic book movie that expresses what's happening in the real world"". I see it as a good representation for today's bullying and how evil, we are as human beings."
1646,"Joaquin Phoenix should get the Oscar 3 years in a row, for the Joker performance. Amazing physical change and adaptation for the role. Can not imagine how hard it was (for J.P) to get out of the Joker mind after the movie."
1647,As a filmmaker and educated cinema historian who studied under a notable film critic and filmmaker. This is the best film of the year. And maybe one of the best films of the 21st century.In a growing market of cheap action CGI films and popular trite this movies shines like a star.Joaquin Phoenix just became the best American Actor alive.The negative reviews are either uneducated or bias; Hands Down.As scary and troubling as it is humorous: Exactly what the Joker represents. Finally.
1648,"I left the theater stunned speechless. There really isn't an adequate way to describe Phoenix's genius portrayal of the Joker. I can say there were an abundance of moments when the hair on my arms literally stood up, moments when I could not breathe. See this movie for no other reason than to watch the mastery of his work. We will never meet or know a character like Joker, but Phoenix will bring you as close as you can be to true madness without losing your life. If he does not receive the Oscar for this role, it is only because of fear."
1649,"Todd Philips' ""Joker"" has spread so many comments and controversy that I don't know exactly where to stand. The film reminded critics of Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" and while Joaquin Phoenix' performance channeled the inner angst and alienation that drove the driver Bickle to an extreme -and bloody- corner, I found so many other sources of inspiration that if anything, ""Joker"" is the best tribute to the New Hollywood period.I found ""Network"" in the film, ""Death Wish"", references to ""The King of Comedy"", Marty's underrated movie about a man who wished to exist through the only talent he felt being endowed with... and naturally, there's something of ""A Clockwork Orange"" in the obscene stylishness the Joker embraces his new persona with. In a way, that the film met with controversy is logical, you can't make a social comment about violence and its dangerous appeal by sugarcoating it, violence like its enemies, use symbols and slogan, in fact, revolt is a mask that violence uses to operate undercover or is it the opposite? ""Joker"" is the slap today's audiences needed and that it used the Joker mask in our superhero era makes it even more relevant and accessible. But truth be said, any controversy the film should stir mustn't distract from the real deal.Indeed, any viewer familiar with one tenth of Phoenix' filmography knows the actor's ability to portray enigmatic and troubled characters with a dark side barely hidden, but even with that in mind it's impossible not to be blown away by his performance and compelled by his suffering. He shouldn't be the dark horse of the awards season but the frontrunner because his performance is so rich, so powerful, so intense and so bizarre and grotesque in a captivating way that it's almost like watching a movie within a movie, as if his distortable face was the operation theatre to his acting force, as if his nervous smile slowly turning into cries made a true symphony of pathos and anger. That actor is a treasure to Hollywood and here he's given the kind of rangy performances that can't do without earning awards. His snubbing would be controversy material if you asked me.Now, to the film. The first act immerses us in the life of Arthur Fleck, a clown and wannabe stand-up comedian. At first, I was afraid that the manic laughter scenes would be too redundant and turn themselves to cheap gimmicks, to remind us that we're dealing with the Joker, but no, Phoenix plays his Arthur as a man who's not a bad person. Raised by an over-protective and sickly mother, brutalized by kids who sees in a clown a living sign saying ""kick me"", humiliated by people who can't understand his medical condition, the point isn't to portray Joker as a martyr but a product of a specific environment and education, or lack thereof. Like anyone, he's got dreams, projects, but he's entrapped in a condition that makes it impossible to communicate or connect with the others except through hallucinations and would-happen moments, he's a misfit with a fragile condition that keeps worsening until it offers a platform for his dark psyche to perform.Does the film excuse him? No. Does it justify his actions? Hell, no. It just clarifies the need to perform that way. There's a point of no return reached in that psychological journey, when one humiliation too many triggers a strong desire to express itself through a sort of showmanship, something relevant in our days where people seek any ways to reach posterity. Set in what seems to be the early 80s, it puts Arthur in the same urban alienation context than Travis Bickle but with a passion shared with Rupert Pumpkin's and a ""mad-as-hell"" prophetic rage with Howard Beale's role. Near the end, there's a shot that follows one of the film's most shocking moment and it's an obvious nod to the anticlimactic finale of Lumet's masterpiece.But I can't insist too much on how good Phoenix his, one could see a few impersonations of Malcolm McDowell's dance when he ""punished"" his fellow droogs or get vibes from the two only performances that earned a posthumous Oscar, Peter Finch and Heath Ledger, still, there's something unique in that tormented role he inhabits with such a soul dedication that it makes Nicholon's Joker worse than the cartoon counterpart. ,""Joker"" isn't dangerous but brave enough to question violence in the way it seems like the only plausible answer, it might titillate a few demagogue instincts but that's an unfair trial in the light of the recent events all over the world and that preceded the film. I walk often at night and see homeless people living in impoverished conditions, drowning their sorrows in alcohol and losing their manners once there's nothing to lose... and perhaps that's leaders' responsibility, praising democratic values while its application contradicts its own ideal. Anything is allowed when nothing is possible, is perhaps the biggest joke of all, and that it goes all downhill when the social budget is cut is perhaps the film's boldest stance against the shift between leaders and people.And that it used Bruce's father Thomas Wayne to connect the final act with a canon we're all familiar with is one of the many narrative delights of that character study and psychological thriller à la ""Woman Under the Influence"" where suspense doesn't come from a bomb but a ticking bomb of a soul. If De Niro's presence ties the plot with its chief inspirations, the film belongs to Joaquin Phoenix who gave a performance for ages, and a character who's relevant in the way he pits democratic ideals against urban reality. And my wish is to see another connection with De Niro with Phoenix winning an Oscar, it would be the second time for a character who already won one after De Niro with ""The Godfather Part II"".As for the glorifying violence trial... we've been there already."
1650,"Joker is kinda old wine in new bottle. it seems like most of the scenes are taken from the other movies and assembled in good fashion. Character in the movie and the story telling is not clear but diluted. if it is consider a movie as a story of a mental illness and how society take on these guys then definitely there are lots of movie that you may come up better than this and if you think about it as prior of
character joker development then it is not done right.Actual Joker character hadn't neurological disorder or some sort of mental illness instead he was clever psycho."
1651,"A roller coaster. Not a second of this film left us wanting, it was possibly one of the best films I've ever seen. The Joker is just an amazing character."
1652,Joaquin phoenix should get an Oscar for this.movie is outstanding.
1653,"This movie was absolutely amazing in every way. I'm so glad they finally displayed mental illness in the correct way and although he was/ is the bad guy, it also sheds light on what causes someone like him to snap. I would watch it over and over again. The actor deserves an Oscar. He was awesome."
1654,"If you walked out of this, give it a few... Frozen 2 will be out soon enough."
1655,Being a guy that's only hobby is to watch movies I can say that this is one of the best movies I've seen in the last 30 years
1656,"This movie is a masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix did an amazing job, and he totally has to get an Oscar for it! Best movie I have ever seen!"
1657,"Scrolling down Instagram and Facebook you might come across this quote ""Put on a happy face"", ""Whenever happens you should smile"" and this quotes are the main theme of JOKER. The film begins with Arthur aka joker laughing and you can feel every emotion joker's laugh had except the emotion of happiness cause joker is not happy from inside and that's why he is going under 7 medications even though if it's not helping him. Acting - Acting is top notch, it's something you might have never seen before. Joaquin phoenix is quite old in age and that's why in close up you can see linings on his face and you can see how those linings make his laugh, and sadness more effective. With facial expressions there are macro expressions which you can notice on close up and those macro expressions shows the class of acting this guy has done. Music - Background music is top notch the song ""Send in the clowns"" fits perfectly with the theme and in some part the background score so perfect that it glorify the scene for example the scene where Arthur is checking his gun n there is this music played in TV shows which helps to intensify the mood. Makeup and lighting is even perfect after The dark knight if there's something everyone was talking the most after heath ledger's acting then it's his makeup. He himself did the makeup so it can be realistic and in this Joker makeup is good, simple, subtle and perfect according to the script, some small details makes you a fan of the make up artist like painting a kind of tear drop under the eye bags and at some places the right eye's blue colour is slightly spread because of joker's tears. The lighting makes you feel it's a 90's setting and dark film. Unpredictable storyline - Just like Spiderman far from home this film has lots of surprises for you and you cannot say what will happen next, anything can happen at any point and it is so balanced that you don't feel like there is too many surprises. The first half is quite slow but makes you feel pity over Arthur, the mental and laughing condition of Arthur and the way the people treats him makes you question about your way of treating people like that. The best thing of the film is it hasn't shown Joker has a hero they have shown him, it has shown him as a person who is the biggest villian of Batman and the reason behind his attitude. The film leaves the descision on you wheather what he is doing right or not and everything in the film is perfect and balanced and you cannot argue on that. If you like to see dark film and writes stories or you wanna be an actor then this is a must watch."
1658,"The movie that you will never forget
The main character was legendary and great
Qoaquin Phoenix i have nothing to say about his iconic performance
Everything is 10/10"
1659,"Well, this review will not contain any spoilers, although I must say, if you read it, just don't complain me for this poor society that we live in. This is, with absolutely no doubt, one of the movies of the century, one of the movies that has no precedent, just art, just a true show about the real downsides of this society, and still, humanity keeps failing, over and over again...I already know, that we (humans), don't have the same tastes, the same ideologies, and the same problems, but it's a bit shameful see the younger, just arguing (and with no real arguments whatsoever), that this movie is just boring, non interesting, and non relevant.Sometimes, we have to grow, to understand the real sadness, to understand the madness, the provocative world that we live in, but unfortunately some of the youngest have real problems, and I've already been there.For those who find this movie quite forgettable, just leave the cinema, and continue to see your favourite movies.For those, who can't get the job done (like, reading some info), before the movie session, try to do so on a future visit.Art is art. Madness is madness. And Joker is Joker."
1660,"Finally we get a Joker who is not Batman-centered, a Joker who walks his own path and tells his own story. Thank you!
This is the best 2019 movie to hit theaters and it will stay in the minds everyone who watched for a long time whether you liked or disliked it.
It's not a movie for the critics' praise, rather than a medical diagnosis of our time. Should you fail to notice the message Joker brings, you might as well surround yourself with happy thoughts and watch a Disney movie."
1661,"I saw the joker film when it was released and I thought it was brilliant, it does have some violent moments but I thought it handled the issue very well, if people didn't like it then they should have known what they were getting themselves into when watching a movie about the iconic joker. Joaquin Phoenix to me did a marvelous portrayal of the Joker, his laugh is my favorite Joker laugh as it's how I imagine the laugh would sound straight from the comic book pages and he made the character his own interpretation, which I'm sure many people will be interested in seeing.I can definitely see people talking about this film many years from now as people are still doing with The Dark Knight before it, if you haven't seen it already I would highly recommend watching the film."
1662,"I never write reviews for any movie. This movie made me write it, Well Joaquin Sir..Take a bow.
What a superb acting. We start with having sympathy with the character and end up supporting him.
Somehow we don't feel that whatever he does is wrong. It feels justified.
Crisp direction and amazing background music.It's a must watch. Go and see it today."
1663,"So sad movie, so we'll done,. J.P is so good in this roll. I was amazed. You feel him, he's a good person. No feel good movie but a few laughs.Best I seen. #how much can a person take"
1664,"A brilliant use of current problems in capitalist societies, sheer the rich want to get even richer and so they demand governments and councils use austerity on the masses to fuel tax cuts for the rich.
One specific result is the cuts to services that help those with mental illness. Hence Joaquin Phoenix's character depends into an abyss from which the Joker emerges.
The dance sequence down the long set of steps to the Glitter Bands Rock and Roll (part 1 & 2), beats anything Fred Astaire could do.If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get an Oscar for this, then scrap the Oscars."
1665,"There has been a vocal split from the critics about whether this movie is a dark masterpiece or a deliberately problematic film that elicits sympathy for those who shouldn't get it. I get where the critics are coming from with Joker being a disruptive and atypical superhero movie but I just don't agree. I never saw Arthur as the hero of this movie and I think if you look hard enough, the movie doesn't present it that way either. We spend so much time with him that you can't help but feel sorry for him but his actions are still despicable and he's locked up in the end for good reason. He's a sympathetic villain at best and while Joker definitely shows a fresh perspective for a comic book movie, I don't think there's some sinister motivation to incite hate. Todd Phillips (the writer/director here) tends to lean towards darker characters, darker humour and darker motivations and this movie seems like an evolution of his work. It was interesting to get the superhero story from the other perspective, the villain who has been ignored and beaten up by society and who was sick but couldn't get the help he needed. It was an inspired decision to tell the story this way and I was enthralled when I watched Joker without being tricked into thinking he was some tragic hero in disguise. Could this movie be interpreted that way? Yes but that's dependent on the viewer and I can't penalize the movie for that.When a movie is set in the crappy part of town, a city ghetto or even a post-apocalyptic world, you don't expect to be impressed by cinematography or editing or costuming but this movie was impressive in all those areas. It's beautifully shot and the editing is seamless. It really helps blur the lines between what is actually happening to Arthur and what he's imagining but its done in a very artistic way. The movie feels authentic because of how grimy and dismal the setting is and I liked that they went back to a more conventional look for the Joker as opposed to Suicide Squad which really swung for the fences but missed the mark. The makeup even plays an important roll in how Arthur acts and that was well done. This movie looks great and with all the hype surrounding it, I was looking for pitfalls when I saw this in the theatre. But Joker was up to the task, I also enjoyed the score minus one song which felt like someone accidentally hit the shuffle button in iTunes. The score is largely comprised of songs previous to or from that era and then in a montage there's some arena rock. Luckily its cuts off quickly and this is only a minor complaint.Joker is centred around Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) who will eventually become the Joker. I loved how well developed he was as a character. Its not always the classic Joker origin you may or may not be familiar with. I've talked a little bit already about how's he not a hero but I saw this as a story of someone who had some well earned (through little to no fault of his own) psychotic tendencies and when he really needed help, he was cast aside or just ignored by both those in power and those few individuals in his life. He tries to keep going but it becomes too much and once his switch is flipped, there's just no going back for Arthur. Almost all of his relationships with those around him (minus Sophie which has BIG issues in a different way) are flawed and toxic. I also liked how his motivations evolved pretty naturally as the movie went on. This is not a justification of his thought process but the movie illustrates how he moved from A) to B) to C) and it never seemed too implausible for this genre. Inorganic character motivations drive me nuts and I was pleasantly surprised at how all the events in Joker added up.The part of the Joker comes with a stigma after Heath Ledger and while Jared Leto is a great actor, his portrayal of the iconic character was definitely polarizing. Phoenix has a reputation of being a gifted actor, entirely committing to his roles and being an oddball for a leading man. His portrayal of Arthur is right up there with Ledger for me. I wouldn't say better or worse but Phoenix lives up to the legacy. He's got strong material to work with but he makes Arthur both sympathetic yet frightening. His story is tragic but he could explode at any moment. He shaped his body for the part and from the first moments past the opening credits, its very clear he's in 100%. He'll get awards recognition and its deserved. I haven't seen a performance this year that I would say is better.The supporting cast is definitely there in service of Arthur but they feature some excellent work too. I was surprised Robert DeNiro was in this so much as Murray Franklin but he fit in this movie pretty well. He's not hammy yet he carries his part and he was legitimately good in this. Zazie Beetz was a solid choice for Sophie. Her relationship with Arthur is problematic (it was also my biggest gripe with the movie but they answered my questions pretty definitively by the end) but that's her character, not her. She's beautiful and its easy to see why she's on her way up. Frances Conroy is also doing great work, her character is essential to who Arthur is and her role in this is also pretty tragic. I would also credit Brett Cullen as Thomas Wayne, he's a pretty ambiguous character through Arthur's eyes and his performance is in tune with this movieThis is a GREAT movie that hopefully represents a shift in the comic book genre. Whether you love this movie completely or hate its guts, its a changeup for the genre and I would argue that it was needed. We need more bold ideas like this for the superhero movie to continue to dominate. Is the Joker an uncomfortable movie? Absolutely! I was uneasy the entire time and I shifted in my seat a lot during the squeamish parts. Is it a fun movie to watch? I would also say no, its methodically paced and with all the uncomfortable bits, its thoroughly unpleasant. But when it comes to the quality of the movie, this is a TRIUMPH! The acting is fantastic, its masterfully shot and tightly written and the ending packs a real gut-punch. Its one of the few times that I thought about the ending after and realized that I don't know if anything else would have been true to the story and the character. I would love a sequel but I don't think Joker has to have one. The arc of the story opens and closes artfully and the creative team might be better served by leaving it alone. Fantastic work from Phoenix, Phillips, the creative team and the supporting players make this a must-see. It will end up in my 2019 top 5. If you haven't already, check this out and see where you weigh in."
1666,"The Joker is just brilliant!! the plot of the story is excellent. Deep story touched your soul and make ur mind think! Much respect to the directer Todd Phillips 👏👏 he's just genius! And Joaquin Phoenix is just insane! He deserves to get the Oscar for his Super top performance and great acting in this movie 👌👏.. Also the music was nice.. Everything was great, It is one of the best movies i ever seen in all time, I really enjoyed it and you must watch it if you are looking for real story! Nothing to say more! 🤡"
1667,"Eversince Phoenix was attached to play the iconic Joker, I was eagerly waiting for this film. I had high expectations in terms of acting in the film and I was completely blown away after seeing it. This film is the best of the year and will be a cult classic in coming years. Direction is near perfect and cinematography is beautifully poetic as expected from a DC movie. You dive into the 80s Gotham and see the world through Arthur's eyes. You witness his transformation into the Joker and the reasons behind it. The end of the movie will make you think what's real and what's fantasy as they say joker has a multiple origin stories. Not sure about Best Picture but expect Academy Award for the Best Actor for Joaquin Phoenix."
1668,"By far the best movie this year. This should be the starting story of creating the Joker. It's supposed to make a new movie where it relaxes that tension and creates a sick mind of something resembling the Heath ledger joker. Where he becomes a psychopath but leads a group of people off the street and is the most evil supervillain. This type of dancing smoke bomb, pistol and all those magician clown stuff that go with it. With some kind of horror puzzle mix, but it hasn't been copied."
1669,"Loved it. Hard to describe. It is rare these days that they make a movie that is more art than commercial. Phoenix's acting is sublime. He makes you feel familiar with the character. Like you know him personally, feel his pain.
This is going to go down as an all time classics and one of the darkest movies of our era."
1670,"'Joker' is an uncomfortable masterpiece that will leave you walking away from the movie theatre confused about how you feel. It's a conversation piece that anchors itself deep into the origins, mentality and motivations of a disturbing psychopathic anarchist.This movie isn't for everyone, especially if what you're expecting to see is a thrilling face off between a villain and a superhero. But if your going into this movie wanting to see and feel something you've never seen or felt before, then you're in for one hell of an experience.Most films will leave you with a short term emotion, this film is one of few leaving you with many long term emotions that take a while to process, and that, in my opinion, is what makes a movie deserving of 10/10."
1671,"It's rare for me to give a movie 10 stars, but Joker is totally worth it.
It is a very strong drama movie that won't let you move your eyes for a second. the music and sounds affects are genius,
adding a lot to the general atmosphere - first when you get to know the Joker
and how everything is going horribly wrong.
It got to the part of the movie that there are supposedly comedy parts, but the director wants you to feel how it is wrong and not really funny.
The movie really make you get to know the joker's personality and creeps you out.
I watched it yesterday and I still get chills up my spine thinking of some of the scenes."
1672,"Normally, it helps me more to put DC or Marvel movies under a different category from other movies to be fair when I rate them, but this one was really on another level. A great script that gave us a deep story, well-organized chapters, superb acting performance and yes it was based on comics!
Even though it's a slow-paced movie, I didn't feel like there's a slow buildup in any chapters, which is not easy to avoid in these kinds of dark drama movies. Joaquin took the movie to another level, and it's really fair enough to say it's 'Joaquin's movie'. He really made every scene counted on the screen. I can't remember any scene was there just to help the story, not his character. Everything in the movie should be about him, and that's what he did.
When I watched the movie in the cinema, there were mixed emotions between the audience for most of the scenes. You don't know if you should laugh? or feel sad. These stressful situations were greatly made with the help of Joaquin's performance. He was always in control of these kinds of situations and when things require outsourcing support, the soundtrack comes in the right moment. Hildur made a great job by giving the soundtrack theme a character that I felt personally it's a little bit inspired by Hans Zimmer's masterpiece the Dark Knight, but with a more slow pace and dark feel.
I liked how during each chapter there were these scenes that look like some encaustic or painting to recap the joker personality changes.
Some people are saying the story is not 100% loyal to the comic, but what's wrong with that? Make a nice movie and implement all film success factors then I'm more than satisfied.
The only thing that I felt is not 100% complete after watching the movie for the second time is the last 20 min. I think it was necessary for an extra 15 or a maximum of 20 min for the last Joker personality transformation. But maybe the writer wanted to focus on what things that made the Joker as he is instead of the Joker himself. So yeah it's fine.
I know there are obvious ideas that can be reflected in other ones in the Taxi Driver movie, but it's really been used brilliantly. If someone watched the two movies and focused on the last Joker chapter, he will understand why I'm saying that.
It's really hard - without considering the comics' loyalty thing - to not give this film a full mark. It's been years since I watched a deep movie like this one.
I had a big question after I finished the movie, what's wrong in having a good script that leaves the freedom for actors to give a stunning performance in superhero movies? What's wrong with a good deep story instead of just counting on CGI? A lot of people are really starving for a well-written drama superhero movie. I hope Joker can help in this direction."
1673,"The hype is real but please go into this film with an open mind. The cinematography, score and acting are all absolutely faultless but the subject matter is disturbing and I felt myself turning away at points, just to give myself a breather. This wasn't due to the violence, but to see such a stark and visceral portrayal on mental illness and it's sociopolitical impact on the big screen was hard to swallow. I think anyone who has been through their own mental health struggles will feel the same.The subtle nods to batman and the dark knight films were great, and gave just enough foundation to the story without it being a cliche 'Batman film' (not saying that in a derogatory way either - I'm a massive batman fan)So worth a watch and a rewatch, and a massive bravo to Joaquin for a stunning performance."
1674,"Specifically created an account to give this a rating. 10 stars might be too high, but 9 stars felt too low so I will give it 10 stars. The cinematography, music and acting is all absolutely top notch. The movie grips you from start to end, bravo!"
1675,Incredible movie im speechless diffidently deserves to be in top 5 movies !!!!!
1676,"I'm truly speechless, its a hype which take you to other world."
1677,"Best movie ever , the story the acting it makes u feel that he's an important person to you and makes u feel sympathetic about his feelings"
1678,"Just a Great big 2019 movie....
-
Oscar is Coming, I love it"
1679,"This movie deserves an oscar. Breathtaking cinematography. And the acting of Joaquin Pheonix is incredible. The character is evolved beautifully during the movie, I did not want it to end."
1680,"Joaquin Phoenix truly deserves to win an Oscar for this. To act and perform the way as the ""Joker"" was special! I don't think any other actor could of done it the way he did. He touched everybody's soul and the film has a meaning to it. It gives a chance for people to realise that mental illness is a thing. Never judge a person and to be kind to one another because you just never know what a person is going through.10/10"
1681,"Who does not understand this movie runs blindly through the world ....
A masterpiece!"
1682,Best movie I've seen in a long time. I didn't think there would ever be another Joker as good as Heath Ledger's adaptation (may he rest in peace) but this movie proved me wrong.
1683,"I've heard a handful of people say this is a bad film
That's there opinion fair enough
Joachim Phoenix is amazing in this to the point I think he is a better joker than Heath Ledger which is a bold statement as I loved Heath as the joker
Phoenix takes this role and runs with itI could watch over and over"
1684,"This movie is truly a modern masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix does justice to Joker where Heath Ledger left off. But I wouldn't want to compare both their performances as many have already said, ""It would be like comparing apples to oranges."" But I at least know that Heath Ledger can rest easy in heaven knowing Joaquin brought the character under a new light with his phenomenal performance. Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix have really outdone themselves with this new take on The Joker. Joaquin and Todd bring a whole new aspect to Joker that has never really been talked about before, tackling the issue and importance of mental illness and a few other problems with modern society. And to address all the fear-mongering the media throws towards this movie, ignore it. Most of it isn't even relevant towards the actual movie and much of it are lies. I couldn't recommend another movie to watch over Joker. This movie will not disappoint. In fact, it goes above expectations (surely went over mine). Case in point, please consider giving this film a watch. I can't recommend this movie enough."
1685,"A great great movie with amazing acting
Best movie in a long time .
Best movie for this year for sure ."
1686,Brilliant film. It deserves all the positive reviews it's getting. Joaquin Phoenix was amazing in this. Oscar worthy performance
1687,"Though the movie JOKER is kind of brutal, it serves an eye-opener to each one of us.
Depression is a really serious issue and a lot of people are experiencing this. They may look happy on the outside but we don't know that these people are facing some issues in their everyday life such as being bullied.
We should be mindful of our actions and words being uttered. Never make fun of other people's feelings as this can make someone feel crazy, feel depressed and worst, causing them to end their own lives."
1688,"There is no balance in this movie, 2 hours of chaos, you leave the movie theater in pain, without resolution. This movie might help you to accept the reality that you have been denying since you remember yourself, this movie may help you to accept yourself as you are."
1689,I can't believe what happening here .. all I can say that's the movie is a masterpiece.
1690,"Joker was not only a fantastic story that was filled with emotion and intensity, it also portrayed mental illness as something that should be taken care of in the real world. When you watch Joker he does all these crazy things in the movie but the story isn't necessarily telling us to forgive him for his acts but more or less understanding him for what he did.The story was so well put with emotion and heart breaking agony for the main character and joker made it seem as if he couldn't take it anymore. Phoenix took his acting to a whole other level for this film and him and this film definitely deserves an Oscar"
1691,"This is kind of movies you watch over and over again, the soundtrack, the vintage footage of the 70s'/80s'
And above all the acting of Juaquin phoenix ... stunning 🤡👺🤡"
1692,"It's very interesting to watch a talented actor depict a compelling and unique character falling into madness. This kind of movie heavily depends on the actor's performance so I was worried if Joaquin could pull it off, but he really exceeded my expectations.One of those movies that I couldn't get enough of after watching it, don't think I'll get easily tired of discussing about the it and watching clips or the whole thing again."
1693,"The movie is too dark, awkwardness leaks in every single minute of it...However, it delivers a very clear and strong message that cannot be mistaken.The purely genuine performance of the Joker adds to its darkness & beauty."
1694,"This is a great piece of art! The cinematography was absolutely breathtaking! Joaquin Phoenix is definitely one of the best actor period, his performance was out of this world."
1695,Joker Throws comic book films into the trash. this movie is so Good that you don't even have to know who the joker is in the first 10 minutes it grabs you it makes you interested. It shows you the world Of Arthur Fleck why he did the things he did why he thinks the way he thinks don't even consider this a DC film because it way more then that absolute MASTERPIECE.
1696,"By far the film of the year, Joaquin Phoenix morphs from Arthur to Joker seamlessly, and it isn't rushed, it just slowly unravels into chaos stunningly.
Range of emotions, from shock, amazement & sorrow.
A sad plight, perfectly executed."
1697,"I came into the theater expecting to be a bit disappointed. Seeing people in droves rate this movie as a masterpiece made me think this would be another overblown DC flick but my low expectations were put to shame. This is a film that is unlike anything i have seen in the past years. This is a visceral, haunting film that will be very difficult to forget. My eyes were practically glued to the screen. I didn't want to miss a single detail. Seeing Arthur Fleck's transformation into the Clown Prince of Gotham is downright masterful. I cannot recall character development done so effectively, yet realistically. You comprehend Fleck's motives, even if you don't agree with the harsh extent to which he takes them. You see how society could craft such an individual. How our society could isolate and destroy an Arthur Fleck. Although Fleck has mental issues, within the first half of the film he wishes to cause no harm and only wants to follow his dream to make people laugh. Of course the majority of credit has to go to Joaquin Phoenix. His work is tremendous. The laugh, the mannerisms. Phoenix portrays Fleck like a real person. A tormented person who has received much trauma over his life, and how a series of unfortunate events finally cause him to snap. How he tried to smile through the pain until the pain made him smile. It's a brilliant performance that deserves every award across the board. I never thought someone could come close to Ledger's work, but Phoenix possibly surpasses Ledger. I could go into great detail about the terrific music choices, the score, the cinematography which captures Gotham oh so well, the directing, and even De Niro's work. Everything clicked. There's no false not. It built to a such a powerful climax i had goosebumps among a crowded theater. This is a decade defining film, and one unlike anything you'll see again in quite some time. Let's hope the Oscars do the right thing."
1698,Oscar-worthy performance by Mr. Phoenix. There's too much about this film that is perfect and unbelievable. You just need to watch it for yourself.
1699,Made an account just to post this review for the best movie I've ever seen in my life.
1700,We needed a movie like this one for a long time and we got a movie that deserves all the wait.
1701,"It has excellent acting cinematography, sound design, production design, colouring and of course acting. It is close to a masterpiece. It may even be one of this year's best movies.
It cannot be easily compared with superhero movies as it has its own unique expression.Where this movie lacks; is making the final jump. Although the elements are there, the final jump seems a little forced. We know who Joker is and we saw who he was and WHY he became Joker. But the metamorphosis has a small gap.Also the Joker we see; is immature yet, so the elements of his dark philosophy are missing.I would definitely recommend this movie as piece of art, to all mature audiences."
1702,"Even days after watching this I literally cannot get Joker out of my head. It's one of the best films I have seen in years. It's dark, menacing, chaotic & yet beautiful. Joaquin's portrayal of Joker is simply mesmerising. His performance was chilling yet moved me to tears, just so inspiring."
1703,He really deserves an Oscar for Best Actor. Astonishing performance. I am so feel in his deep character. And I am sure that this film will sweep Oscars next year. This film is Super Contender for Oscar ! 10/10 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
1704,"This movie is a masterpiece. Best movie I've seen my whole life. Joaquin Phoenix is just beyond amazing, the best acting I've ever seen from any actor ever! Must see."
1705,8.5/10. Incredible acting by Joker. Should win best actor easily. Directing is also Oscar worthy. All in all an incredible film which can be watched several times with different interpretations. Will probably go see it again soon and the rating could go up from a 8.5 to a 9 once I wrap my head around it all. A well done film.
1706,Oscar worthy! Amazing mental twisted! One of my all time favorites!
1707,We all have known joker character from many movies(Especially my favorite Heath Ledger) but this one is the B!!!(I m not going to say that but hard to digest & the hype is real) Well...what a character development... Specially the transformation to JOKER... Hats off to Joaquin Phoenix.. This guy deserves an Oscar really...
1708,"Joaquin is something else I stand for him and raise my hat to his acting skills he never ever disappoint you, there's nothing I can say or describe this movie but a masterpiece. Please watch it and open your heart and embrace him he deserves it."
1709,"Modern America is like Murray show where opinions are created for greater masses & every difference is looked upon with contempt. Such is mindless campaign to boycott a movie because it will provoke violence in a country where gun can be bought while shopping for groceries.Joker is examination of people's behavior towards those in need, sick individuals who are pushed to the margins just because they need help. While city is choking in garbage, funds are being cut on social help & medical care, elite in suits are smiling while watching Chaplin. Wayne is not different then the others and he's finally given human approach rather then all good hero that tried to save Gotham in all other creations.There are no heroes in this movie, there is no light at the end of tunnel & there is no sympathy for titular character but rather a big punch in the face from Todd Phillips to all of us who are actually living in our own Murray show day in day out without ever taking time to reflect what surrounds us.Joker is a must see movie that will make you think about times we live in, about our role in the system & the ones on top never liked ordinary thinking people. Burton took his Joker straight from comics as he fell in acid, but Phillips only needed to put his protagonist in today's world.So who's laughing now?"
1710,"I went to the greatest movies I have ever seen in my 54 year life. Joker is not a villain. I gave it 10 stars, to the Oscar people it deserves at least 10 of those.
Phoenix will receive an Oscar for sure."
1711,One in a lifetime movie! The plot will have you on the edge of your seat. Joaquin Phoenix deserve an Oscar for his role as the joker. Todd Phillips could have not wrote or directed a better script .
1712,One thing i can say this movie should won all awards on this planet.
1713,Not a single point in this movie will dissapoint anyone . As we know that joker in dark knight has set huge mark on peoples heart . This movie had not let its progress down . The most satasfying movie and really good thinking from director about how jokers life will be in his days . Brillant work
1714,This sure is a masterpiece. It is directed and acted so beautifully that you just can't believe someone really has given performance like that of Heath. The Dark story for which DC is famous for is really wonderful. When it's about JOKER no marvel can match it for sure (Not a DC or MARVEL fan still have to agree about last line).
1715,"First of all, dont expects that you will get an action movie cause this film isn't an action movie. The experience this movie will give is unpredictable, the music, the cinematography, the character development, the storytelling, all of of this things looks solid. This movie deserve oscar. 10/10"
1716,"Best Movie Ever Made. The Acting, The Direction, The feels.
This is DC."
1717,My favourite film of 2019. Beautiful acting from Phoenix and something i'll be thinking about for days!
1718,"Just came back from a screen of this & was blown away by how good it was! I knew it be great anyway, but from actually seeing it, I'm convinced!The film tells the backstory of how the Joker became who he was & what his personal life was like before he snapped & became a cold blood murdering villain!I found the film to be fully engaging! It was dark, blood, brutal & visually stunning! The actors done great jobs & preformed very well by giving convincing portrayals!I'm starting to like the trend in the DC Universe where these 15+ versions are showing us the raw & truly gritty side of these villains/heroes you never get to see in these watered down 12+ versions!Overall an epic, brutal & raw story about the Joker!Go & see this! 10/10"
1719,"I already wrote a review, but after reading afew reviews which are giving bad points and talking about violence, I decied to update my review.I want to ask these guys who are giving bad review and taling about violence.
Do you know who is JOKER? You think you come to cinema and watch Romeo and Juliet? JOKER is a criminal, one of the most scary and crazy criminals in all history. So if he takes his victims and cut their body to separate parts you shouldn't be surprised because that's JOKER. That's how it should be, nothing else. So if you can not watch it, go watch some melodrama movie
The funny thing is there are too many movies with 100 times more violence like Game of Thrones, John Wick and .... But you know why they say Joker has more Violence? Because on other movies you say, OK, that's just a movie, but in JOKER you believe it. It's so real. You live with the Joker from beginning until end and you accept and believe what he does. You never says, OK that's just a movie. You say damn it's real life. It's so real!
You feel him, you get sad for him, you have pain with him and you scare of him as hell. That's a real act and movie should be!Also never compare jokers together, all of them were good in their time and the movie they played. But the Joker Phoenix played is so real and accetbale. Is not like superhero movies. Is like yeah, that's why Joker exist. You beleive everybody can be a Joker if we had a miserable life like him. So if you go to cinema just enjoy from his act. Don't sit and say, oh Heath Ledger was better or Phoenix. Just enojy!I just saw this masterpiece first day came to cinema and all my mind is still with the movie!
My wife says, finish it!!! You are all the time talking about movie at home haha...
But that was realllllllyyyy good. An amazing masterpiece!!!
Next week I have to keep children and she goes for watching. Because now she is curious to watch what is this movie I am all the time taling about. It's a pitty we can not watch together, somebody should keep children. But soon I go for watching again.
Phoenix did the performance 10 times better than I expected. You really belive the character of Joker opposite of superhero movies. His laughs, acts and crimes ... In cinema nobody was talking, you couldn't hear even one word, even when movie finished. Everybody mind was blown away and with that silence everybody left cinema.
Thank you for such a great masterpiece!"
1720,"I cant even start with this... Its simply a remarkable work...one that i feel so thankful with lífe to be able to experience...
Joaquín Is something out of this World.. i dont know what the critics are smoking with their nonsensical reviews.."
1721,"Best Joker ever! He deserves an Oscar!
I will come back in cinema to see this movie again and again"
1722,"This is not a DC movie. This is not a Batman universe movie. This is a movie about mental health, trauma, and dealing with childhood trauma. Joaquin Phoenix portrays the role amazingly....especially considering he is on the screen almost the entire film.
It's a tough movie to watch, seeing the downward spiral he is experiencing. But it's necessary for people to see this to help understand what others go through, and to help remove the stigma around mental health."
1723,"Masterpiece... , The acting is brilliant , the story is enjoyable , The Movie is just One of the best Movies Ever Made"
1724,"The story is immerse and is filled with emotions. Joaquin Pheonix completely sweeps you into joker's sufferings, rage, grief with his incredible performance. The movie forces you to think about living life from emotionally troubled person's perspective. It's a must watch movie. And the ending is one of the greats."
1725,"Someone pass me an adjective. Listen to no haters or outragers. Go see it right now!!!! Thank you for making this masterpiece. I hope everyone involved in making this film is proud. They deserve all praise. Just WOW. I spent half the movie with my jaw dropped literally. My faith in good cinema is returning. Knock Knock, I want more"
1726,"A real masterpiece. I have been waiting for this movie since Joaquin Phoenix's laughing trailer came out, and i am more than happy to see well worth the wait. Phoenix's performance is hard to forget and we are lucky to see this performance with a great script on the big screen.We watched Batman saving Gotham and sad background of Bruce Wayne's life million times. This film shows and asks a simple question; what if Gotham deserves Joker more than Batman?Lastly; Joaquin Phoenix should win Oscar after this. I don't think any other option would be fair."
1727,What a movie im still shaked best actor for joker what a master piece!!! Loved it
1728,"This film was a pice of art. Each frame looked like a painting. Unbelievable acting, story and cinematography. Love it 10/10!"
1729,"I understand why some people don't like the message that this movie tries to convey... but come on, we can't ignore Joaquin Phoenix's epic performance and Todd Philips' one of a kind directing. I literally can't say anything negative about this film. Just Fantastic. I would give it a 100 out of 10 if that was an option!"
1730,An incredible experience on the first watch.Nothing could have prepared me for this. It grabbed me in the opening moment and would never let go.Unsettling. Shocking. Powerful.Masterpiece.
1731,"Words don't do justice to describe the amazing script, dialogues, story and superb acting in this movie. I am not going to bore your or steal the thunder of the movie with a long review, but let me tell you so far what you know through the teasers and trailers is simply the tip of the iceberg. There is a bigger arch and captivating story in this movie. I just watched the movie, and I am definitely going to watch it at least couple of more times before it is taken off the big screens."
1732,Good actor good story and good movie. Watching the movie again again and again
1733,"Right from the start of the movie, I thought this was garbage. I waited and waited for it to show any semblance of a good story. That's my fault. I should have shut it off as soon as I smelt the stench of it."
1734,"First of all amidst all chaos i could appreciate the brilliance in Joaquin Phoenix's acting. He has nailed what most of the current lot of actors would not even think of reaching. I can specifically see three different personalities inside his role. He did an amazing job on all three.Secondly , A film is not all about how well the lead actor performs and binds to his role. It should have a sound cinematography and Script. Joker is seriously do not have a story to relate for the viewers. In the entire film it was just searching for a story or a message to relate for the viewer. Script is just touching here and there but never had a solid flow or emotions attached to it. That is why I never felt sorry or sad about JOKER or the underprivileged people. I was just having zero emotions to the movement he started or for the things he had done in the film.I would sight this film as a classic example for a failed script which always tried to deliver best scenes for the lead actor. In one aspect Joaquin actually kills all other what would be good factors which would have contributed to overall success of the film. All scenes are directed to make JOKER shine hence the story and the character build up of the rest has been clearly ignored and dumped.This film can win the award for the best actor in a leading role but will not even nominate for any other categories. What did that tell you ? Success of the film or a failure ? It is up to you to decide.I would remind you of ""Forrest Gump"" in 1994 . Tom Hanks played a similar role and all the attention was on to him. But it had a very heartwarming and a complex story to tell. Rest of the cast had a role to play in the story. All in all Tom Hanks did not do justice for him but for the entire film. Film ended winning 6 Oscars in 1995 competing with the likes of Shawshank Redemption/ Pulp Fiction."
1735,"I've heard about this movie, it was praised everywhere, it has a good score here. It was kind of a letdown. It's boring honestly. Plot gets going in the last 30 minutes or so, which means that you will have to sit through 90 minutes of ""development"" eagerly waiting for something to happen. I get that it's not supposed to be action packed - it's all about psychology. But movie is a letdown in that aspect too. I expected more about our protagonist's descent into madness. It doesn't feel like a man just snapped, he was already gone at the beginning, he just got the courage to act on it. And he should not be encouraged and cheered for. The whole premise of the movie is confusing to me. Society doesn't revolve around individuals, you can't expect the whole world to hug you when something goes bad. It would be nice, but you have to fight your own battles."
1736,"In the non-canonical origin story Joker, Joaquin Phoenix plays a deeply disturbed man named Arthur Fleck as he experiences through a series of traumas that turn him into the notorious supervillain.Phoenix is terrific as the agonized loser with a compulsive-laughter condition. He's weird and creepy and full of angst and anger and self-loathing and everyone-else-loathing.The first half hour is simply a grinding, agonizingly slow moving portrayal of Arthur's life. Then there's a moment of stunning, electrifying violence. And then everything gets tedious again.Joker is not a supervillain movie, it's an artsy character study, and if you like those then this might appeal to you. But there's a superficiality to it all. Arthur is deeply disturbed and living in a city where society's have-nots are increasingly disenfranchised, but the script and director don't really seem to have anything to say about mental illness or inequality and injustice.In the run-up to the film, director Todd Phillips criticized ""woke"" culture and the far left, and perhaps that's part of the problem. Woke culture says we need to think about things deeply, and Phillips really, really seem loathe to delve into what it means to be mentally unstable and poor in the greater societal sense. He's only concerned with how it effects Arthur. Arthur is also only concerned with how it effects Arthur, and the result is a film that seems to accept that Arthur is a victim of an unjust society while never really considering why the society is unjust or how much of Arthur's problems might be the result of his own narcissistic self pity.But the main problem with the movie is it's slow-moving and dull far more often than not. I wouldn't recommend it."
1737,"It's just awesome. I loved Birdman and Black Swan cos of the descent into insanity themes but this just blows them out of the water. It's hard to say much without spoilers, if you've any interest in Batman you won't be disappointed. I have huge respect for Heath Ledger in Dark Knight and Mr Phoenix does him major justice as a prequel. Even the soundtrack is great, best comic based film I've seen in ages."
1738,"A mentally troubled middle-aged clown (Joaquin Phoenix) who lives with his mother (Frances Conroy) in Gotham City goes from not good to worse when he finally realizes his true identity. Robert DeNiro plays a talk show host and Zazie Beetz the friendly girl down the hall. Brett Cullen is on hand as Thomas Wayne, Bruce's rich father.""Joker"" (2019) is an arty, slow-burn character study of the popular DC Comics' villain, but it's more of a psychological crime drama/thriller and tragedy than a superhero flick (or, in this case, supervillain). The movie's captivating from the get-go and practically everything works for a broodingly superb cinematic experience.There are several amusing bits, but this ain't a fun flick. It's heavy and tragic. But what's the message? Simply that this is how a quirky man who wanted to make people laugh became The Joker. He's a little reminiscent of the clown in Steve Gerber's ""Night of the Laughing Dead"" in Man-Thing #5 (1974).The movie runs 2 hours, 2 minutes, and was shot in New York City (Bronx, Harlem, Manhattan) and nearby New Jersey (Jersey City & Newark).GRADE: A-/A"
1739,"Simply awesome.By no means a super hero or super villain type of movie. This chronicles one mans decent into insanity. It is grim, relentless, sad and utterly compelling. A damming indictment on how mental health issues are dealt with. Dismissed, mocked or simply ignored.In this story we are shown what happens when such an individual, finally, screams enough is enough. Down trotten, rejected by society and held up to endless ridicule, the Joker when he finally emerges is simply terrifying. His very public outing will go down in cinema history as it is memorising, disturbing and truly believable.There is talk of Oscars for this performance and it is absolutely merited, Joaquin Phoenix simply nailed this part. This is not a popcorn, switch off the brain and watch the action movie. It takes the viewer into the darkest, most distressing thing there is, our own mind.Brilliant movie."
1740,"This movie was sensational.
The actors, the cinematography and most importantly the insight into mental illness and it's victims.
There is such a stigma towards mental illness and watching this movie really highlights some of the reasons that an individual may develop a mental illness, and how someone's childhood and upbringing can effect mental health throughout there entire life.
The joker had serious trauma throughout his childhood, and it came to surface in adult hood as you can see in the movie.
The build up of the movie from start to finish was very intense and overwhelming.
It highlights the stigma people can have towards mental illness and should be an eye opener for those who are too quick to judge people.
Sensational movie. I would recommend this to anybody. Huge thumbs up."
1741,I just watched the Joker and it was so powerfull and its one of the only movies that makes you think about our society and our actions. Its such a masterpiece. A true work of art.
1742,"Thinking to Joker it is a haunting, beautiful film that shines in it's brutality. Not in terms of the violence, but more along the lines of witnessing one man's journey into madness. Each event, each action provides a great amount of weight along with an unease factor.Joaquin Phoenix's performance was phenomenal and you can feel the heartbreak along with the mental strain that continously pushes him into a dark mind set.The grittier nature of Gotham, combined with the beautiful score really help sets the mood, and the songs from Frank Sinatra and Jimmy Durante adds whole another of class in midst of the slums. The Cinematography manages to catches the beauty, and the despair of a Gotham city that is falling apart, not too mention that the score and licensed songs help add another layer to the film."
1743,"NO SPOILERSGreat movie. Tasteful references to 'The King of comedy'. Somewhat in line with the Batman story line. Cinematography, acting, story, character progression, comedic tones... All perfect.A good watch, highly recommended it. I don't know who is paying these critics to write such BS reviews. You're not original when you rate a good movie badly. We all know you are just doing it for attention/clicks/fame. Yours is a dying breed and the more pointless reviews you write the less we will care about you. Grow up."
1744,"Saw the movie yesterday. Amazing. It's a captivating story and also tragic. Joaquin acting is superb, and so is the whole cast. I rarely want to see a movie tive um the cinema, but I think I will make an exception on this one."
1745,"I'm just gonna say wait for the 2nd half.
Its a masterpiece."
1746,"This was the first DC movie that I actually paid attention to and paid money to see. I did go into the cinema with high expectations after watching the teaser for the film. Already, Joaquin Phoenix had astonished me with his talent. It was within the first 10 minutes of the movie that had captured me.It is clear that writer, producer and director Todd Phillips should be credited for this as he kept the audience hooked from the beginning till the end.The way in which Arthur Fleck's life was portrayed was truly amazing storytelling and really took the audience to new lengths in explaining his real life story. Interestingly, Todd Phillips uses the struggling society and city of Gotham to reflect the physical and mental state of Arthur. In doing so, he explained contemporary anxieties and how society's actions impact our lives in terms of behaviour and how it makes us who we really are.From a young age, we are taught that there are heroes and villains. We are always told that the hero needs to defeat the villain and shouldn't be questioned because it is for the ""greater good"". However, we never really stopped to think why it is we have heroes and why we have villains in this world. Instead, we're immediately taught that villains correspond to being evil- that a villain should be punished by a hero. However, after watching the life story of Arthur fleck, is it actually correct to call him a ""villain""?Should someone who has been so badly treated by a toxic society be labelled as a villain? Isn't it true of nature for someone to cry when they are upset? To laugh when told a joke? Actions do have consequences. This is simply the same way it is for Arthur fleck to criticise his society for kicking him when he was down- for pushing him away when he wanted him- for refusing to put on a happy face when all he wanted to do was to be truly happy when society didn't let him.So yes, Arthur may have done some things that make him fall under the category of a ""villain"", but who is the true villain?- him or society?After continuously being beat down and trampled on by society, Arthur fleck began consultation where he would receive medication and ""support"" from a therapist. In this way, it could be said that the medication Arthur was given, may have made his condition worse eg: depression/ anxiety. Aside from this, Arthur had a therapist who would simply ""read lines from a script"" instead of listening and actually helping him. This is part of the major issue in society whereby the people who are vulnerable and needy are pushed away by those who have power, even if it is only a little bit. People like Arthur are neither seen, nor heard and the only time they will be - when they do something that goes against the ""rules of society"" because ""putting on a happy face"" doesn't work for everyone.As the film progresses, Arthur is taken off the very little support he will have been given and stripped from his job. With nothing left, Arthur began hallucinating and suffering from psychosis- believing that things were real when they actually weren't- developing negative thoughts. All he has is ""negative thoughts"".Moving onto the acting in this movie...Joaquin Phoenix as the lead role was a brilliant decision made by Todd Phillips and other casting directors. It is vital that that a role such as JOKER should be played correctly, without a single fault- especially after Heath ledger's Oscar winning performance. Joaquin was nothing short of excellent. Utter perfection. Not a single fault in his acting. From breaking out into laughter to playing an emotionally and mentally wrecked character- Phoenix mastered it all. An Oscar Win is essential and exactly what he deserves. Every moment, every word spoken and every frame that was shot was done to perfection.By Saniya Khan
Assisted by Khadijah SharifThank you to the cast and crew for a brilliant movie and conveying a strong message that needed to be seen and heard."
1747,"This is not a normal superhero movie where you will expect glamorous CG. But it definitely gives you more thrill and excitement than the other superhero movie. A smile, a bully, a setback, a betray, a misunderstanding, a confusion, a lie, a chance, these are what life makes of. Anyone who gave out score lower than 9 repeatedly reported the lack of excitement from the movie, that's because you guys are lack of life experience to feel so."
1748,"Very rarely now it seems does a movie even leave you feeling like it was a worthwhile investment of your time. More often now films are regurgitated storylines, reboots, or an attempt at something new that feels like it shouldn't have been done. Even more rare now is a movie that leaves an impact on you long after you see it. Joker is just that.Granted there is a lot of hype with this movie and an equal number of ""professional"" critics who clearly think it's cooler for them to say this is a terrible movie so that it makes them feel elite over the common moviegoers. With that said, this movie is absolutely perfect and how anyone cannot say that after seeing it clearly doesn't have what it takes to appreciate such raw talent of acting, writing, direction, cinematography, and music.The entire film feels so intentionally and intensely dark, awkward and real that it make you feel the sanity slipping from Arthur's grasp. Phoenix's acting challenges that of even Ledger's Joker and does so through mastering the smallest physical gestures and expressions that make the character feel more real than ever. From the way he runs, dances, stares and smiles it feels 100% authentically Joker.The movie does a great job incorporating elements of the Batman series that fans will enjoy but makes this a completely stand alone movie. For anyone worried that they might not get it because they don't follow Batman, no worries, you won't be disappointed. The storyline does a fantastic job of ""producing"" the Joker, giving him slow building reason behind the madness that feel authentic rather than corny. The incorporation of Pseudobulbar Affect disorder, and even the way it's initially presented and the character's ongoing struggle with it throughout, to explain for and add the maniacal laughter is genius. The childhood trama mixed with current personal and social issues with a desire to fit in makes for compelling reasons to believe this is happening rather than a supervillain being born from being picked on.The entire movie is dark. And that's an understatement. Like Requiem for a Dream level dark. And the story feels like Taxi Driver, V for Vendetta, and American Psycho crammed together inside a Dark Knight costume. All of this is done completely right in every aspect from lighting and angles, to interesting intermittent scenes to add more to the development of the story and character, to perfect camera angles, shots and editing, to intense and properly chosen music. I guess my only criticism is the casting of De Niro. Let's face it, he's not a good actor and we're all just kinda going along with him because he's ""one of the greats"". Earlier in his career and in some roles sure. But not now and not as a funny late night talk show host. But... it's not terrible and they make it work but better casting could have been done rather than relying on a big name.This movie is one that will go down for me as one of the best I've ever seen. I left the theater wanting to buy another ticket and go back in to make the experience last. Very few movies now make you feel something. Even fewer do it this well."
1749,Full of emotions and performance of actor is world class definitely Oscar getting movie
1750,"An.outstanding performance from Joaquin Phoenix, serious masterpiece, a beautiful soundtrack, quality scenes. The best movie of the year and one of the bests of all time"
1751,Outstanding movie with a haunting performance and best character development ever seen
1752,"Not only was this movie a masterpiece, but Joaquin Phoenix's acting is PHENOMENAL! Hands down the best movie on the year. Very dark and beautiful. Explosive and exciting."
1753,It's a fantastic movie and deserve the Oscar prize
1754,"It's the best movie I've seen, at least in the last decade. It's the easily conceivable story of a man who has been abandoned by the system that is supposed to protect us from people like him."
1755,Great movie. It is is the mind of a person with a mental illness.
1756,"Where do I start with this.... the storyline, the acting, it was just incredible. Hats off to Todd Philips, he made all of us viewers jokers as well, cuz whenever he would do something that isn't right, we would get happy and laugh with him. This is one of its kind!!"
1757,Possibly the best comic book character depiction ever put into film. You feel the transition coming through every scene in the film and the wait is amazingly worth it when the joker finally arrives. The scene on the steps when he's become the joker was spine tingling because you realise this really is the Joker that your watching in the flesh. If this is the only version of Phoenix as the joker I'll have to accept it but if they can replicate this quality into a sequel it will be spectacular. What a film!
1758,"I admit it. I did not expect much from this film. But my god It was a nice surprise! Positives is by far the transformation of joker from start of the film to the end. It's incredibly dark and probably too distressing for some people to watch. The violence happens now and then but each time makes a huge impact! The negatives are obvious the main one being of course the late heath ledger, he left quite a high bar to jump! I personally believe phoenix matches him and does jump that bar. People just need to realise this is a different actors approach and different take on a character from a different universe. The second negative is the one that got to me the most. I personally believe part of jokers charm is no one has a clue who he is where he's come from or how he got them scars. I did eventually accept the origin story of course and I ask other hardcore comic book fans to do the same. As once you pass this hurdle this does become one of the best films ever. I will be returning to the cinema to watch this again which Is a first for me."
1759,"From the moment I watched the trailer I was intrigued by the portrayal of this Joker. I loved that they created a backstory for this villain, it made him human. Joaquin Phoenix was amazing, his performance throughout was astonishing, from contorting his body, to dancing, his glance very strong. I also loved the choice of his outfit (and colours) when dancing down the stairs, just perfect. The music, journal writings and silences were powerful. I cannot remember the last time I admired a movie this much."
1760,"10/10 it is unfair for this movie because he deserve more
Special thanks for all the crew in the movie"
1761,"A freaking lengthy-as(s) break-down ahead,but worth it(I guess?)..
Might contain a few spoilers,but if you haven't watched it yet.SERIOUSLY,what are you doing with your life?
To begin with.Todd Phillips.Everyone's going,""man,he's the same guy,that directed The Hangover,right?how was such a guy,capable,of pulling this off?"",for starters,SO WHAT?,as a matter of fact,most of his movies,are comical,you only found The Hangover series?..
Jokes aside,Todd,has literally sculpted this masterpiece,frame by frame.I overheard,that this film,was influenced by Scorsese's-'King Of Comedy' and 'The Taxi Driver',and people were actually,debating,if they liked this film or not,solely,'cause of the fact that this derived some inspiration from cult-classics,like those two?
Beeyatch please!,this is a period film,and blends rather very well with the theme of 'King Of Comedy' and 'The Taxi Driver',so what's wrong,in drawing a little inspiration?annoyed that,this reminds you a lot of those two?(then,I really don't have an answer for that)
The music,scored by Hildur ""I-can't-pronounce-after-that"",was phenomenal,it adds on to the chilly vibes of the film,and instills fear in us,and makes us grateful,that we aren't(literally)on the receiving end of this clown's menace.
Her score,when Arthur dies(psychologically speaking) and The Joker,rises,in the bathroom,is just freaking too-good!
The man behind the cam,Lawrence,has killed it too!(I don't know much about the intricacy of cinematography,so don't really want to blabber,much)
Finally,Joaquin Phoenix.You must have,by now,heard,a lot of critical acclamations,praising his acting,and that,he really deserves an OSCAR,for this,and also,some cliché comments,going ""Oh my God!,OSCAR deserves JOAQUIN,for his performance!""
Well,the HYPE IS TRUE!"
1762,"'Joker' is raw, real. It does not seek to impress but it does, and in what way. Todd Phillips manages to give a new air to the genre of superheroes, and Joaquin Phoenix is sublime in his performance... Not only does he understand the complicated character but he makes it his own. Something very dificult considering the iconic performances of Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger."
1763,"I dislike the DC universe, to be frank. Justice League, Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Superman are boring let downs. Chris Nolan's vision of Batman was certainly decent. Heath Ledger's Joker was compelling and certainly a worthy performance. Joaquin Phoenix has redefined this character in a way that will not be touched by anyone for a long time. This movie is a character study beyond words. I loved it. It's just amazing.I am hopeful that this blueprint will pave the way for more sophisticated adaptations for superhero/antihero movies. It was, at times, heartwrenching and other times downright tense to experience. To the detractors that say that this movie will produce violence....grow up. This is a movie about a VILLAIN. If you didn't assume that violence was a part of the formula, then you are not firing on all cylinders.Oscar's better be in the forecast."
1764,"It's a perfect movie. A character study of the crime prince that takes you inside his unhinged brain. A slow burn of a story that takes its time to unfold and takes you down into madness with Joker
Joaquin Phoenix is PERFECT, and he totally deserves an Oscar nomination for that awesome performance
The haunting soundtrack of hildur guðnadóttir totally augmented the experience of the movie
And last but not least Todd Phillips' directing which had a lot of frames that is art gallery worthy.
It's really weird how half the critics seems to think about this masterpiece of a movie. You know what, just ship us people who enjoy dark psychological crime movies to Mars and keep Teenagers here on Earth for the benefits of your Disney overlords"
1765,This has to be one of the best movies I have ever watched. Simply brilliant. Everything is perfect with the movie and the message it delivers hits us real HARD. It is the harsh truth but no one wants to believe it. The way Joaquin portrays the character is unbelievably good. Hats off 👏
1766,"I will start with the obvious... There is NO comparison with EndGame... Different movies, different styles of cinematography..
The whole thing is just a mirroring to the society at the current time.
Those who have power & money stomp over the ""weak"" but cant see what these ""weak"" are capable of.....
The scene in the train with the 3 bullies is just WONDERFUL...
For the main character, I think that Phoenix goes it to another level. NIckolson was a caricature, Ledger was a maniac, but here we have all the aspects of the Clown Prince of Crime gathered.... Isanity, Paranoia, Pain, Suffering, of course Vengeance and cold blooded reactions...
In the 120 mins there is such a progression in Joker as a person & character, min by min, scene by scene...
Beautiful direction & photography.
There is no discussion for the Oscar of 1st male actor. If the movie is for 10/10, JP is for 12/10."
1767,"2019 America is crazy enough to prepare us for Joker, and yet none of us were. In recent memory, there hasn't been a theatrical experience that has generated this much fear, anxiety and excitement as this one has. That's because Joker seems real. All too real for many people. There have been many films in the past that study the deranged and unstable in our society. Joker even pays homage to many of those films. But what was once just morbid curiosity in art has become a grim and horrifying reality for the American people. A never-ending string of mass-shootings and terrorist attacks have shaped our crumbling civil society. It leaves people shattered enough to see a film like Joker in an entirely different light. The times we live in will forever define the kind of film this is. Make no mistake, Joker is a dangerous film. It's the most subversive film to come along since Natural Born Killers. Yet, for this fact alone, Joker is an unparalleled cinematic event. Not to mention, it's pretty damn good.It's the would-be origin story of Batman's archenemies, placed in a version of Gotham that resembles New York City's not-so-distant past. The Joker's real name is Arthur Fleck, who lives with his ailing mother in a dingy apartment. By day, he's a rent-a-clown, twirling signs outside of closing department stores. But Arthur can't catch a break. In fact, his life is a living hell. He gets beat up in the streets, ridiculed at open mic nights, struggles with meeting women, barely comes home with enough money for food and frequently embarrasses himself by laughing uncontrollably due to a neurological disorder. Meanwhile, as Gotham continues it's decay, a billionaire tycoon with a familiar name rises in politics. Unfortunately for Arthur, he shares a shameful connection with him that his mother never bothered to disclose. Eventually, Arthur snaps. A rough run-in with three boorish Wall Street brokers ends with a Bernie Goetz style bloodbath on the subway, and from there, it's off to the races. Arthur's misery begins to melt away. Suddenly, he comes alive by inflicting merciless violence on the people that have done him wrong. If that wasn't bad enough, the unwashed city dwellers of Gotham find an unlikely hero in Arthur for having stood up to the rich, and unintentionally starts a violent class uprising capable of bringing whatever's left of Gotham to it's knees.Todd Phillips dares to go where nobody ever wanted to with comic book villains. He has sympathy for the devil. To him, the Joker is a victim of circumstance, jaded and destroyed from a cruel world that has beaten him down one too many times. It's a role that demands tenderness from a sad and empty young man, and a breaking point that transforms him into a cesspool of senseless evil. Joaquin Phoenix delivers the greatest performance he's ever given here, in the greatest performance of 2019, and maybe even the decade itself. He breaks your heart and frightens you to the core. He portrays a genuinely real depiction of mental illness, that dares you into understanding it. Every last quivering bit of it. When he laughs, it doesn't feel maniacal and sinister. Instead, it sounds like a pained cry for help. A man completely helpless in controlling himself. You want to tear up just watching it. Yet, when he crosses into the dark side, all of that sympathy washes away, and in it's place comes loathing and fear. Fleck becomes an agent of chaos, with throngs of adoring fans at his feet. In other words, he finally became somebody.Joker is centimeters from a perfect film. It would be, albeit, if you've never seen Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy. It's impossible to watch this movie and overlook the clear as day tributes and similarities. Todd Phillips is a massive Scorsese fanboy. I've known that since War Dogs, which was an Iraq War copy of GoodFellas. In that sense, we aren't getting a uniquely original piece of work in the story behind Joker, and yet Phillips makes it work tremendously within the setting of the famous world of DC Comics. From there, recycled ideas become something new, and through a contemporary lens, this premise has been given a meaning to audiences as shocking now as Taxi Driver was then. Arthur is Travis Bickle, Rupert Pupkin and Howard Beale all rolled into one psychotic package.Joker is no laughing matter. It's a landmark in comic book lore, and an important story to tell in film history. Believe the hype. Send in the clowns."
1768,"Now that the Joker has had a couple of legitimate outings, I think it's clear to say that Joker may be that best outing. I know that Heath Ledger is known to have the best performance, but wow does Phoenix deserve an Oscar. His character goes through such a terrifying and disturbing character arc that you don't want to see, yet can't look away. All the performances are sensational (including a couple of twists) and a brilliant ending to wrap everything together. The score matches it clearly, taking that ""Joker"" persona very clearly. I can't think of anybody that can match what this character may be. If Phoenix wins an Oscar, then this means that the Joker is one of the most complex and interesting character ever in film. All in all, Joker makes the viewer believe that everything he does is okay (but it's clearly not) and keeps you on the edge of your seat through brilliant direction and a sensational character study."
1769,"Phoenix gives an absolutely phenomenal performance as the joker, in my opinion the best that has ever been put to screen. The story goes places you would never expect it to and plays around with the Batman/Gotham city lore/characters in interesting ways.My only slight problem is that I think it takes a little too much inspiration from taxi driver, and that a certain character feels wasted or unimportant but they're not in it for that much anyway"
1770,"One of the most incredible performances I've ever seen in the theater. This acting, the brilliant shots, haunting score, ...this movie deserves every award."
1771,"The title of my review is how I imagine the joker would want me to feel.
I want to smile as the directing and acting is flawless. You believe every scene and quite frankly you would be an a****** to try and pick holes in it.
The crying is how at the centre of it, Arthur actually has a good heart, but was screwed over by society, work and family. What you're left with is the result of someone who looks at life with a glass half full coming to the relation that life is actually a glass half empty."
1772,Wow worlds wouldn't do this film justice MASTERPIECE!
1773,"This JOKER Origin movie is Superb, Classy, Intelligent, and Stylish with the signature DC dark theme. Those who rate this movie low are either doesn't have enough intelligence to fully understand and appreciate the emotional roller coaster of this movie, or they are simply trolls paid by marvel team to discourage audience from coming to the theaters and watch a perfectly awesome DC movie. I'm not saying all DC movies are good, Justice League was awfull, but i totally love JOKER, 99 thumbs up! 👍👍👍"
1774,"Not a huge Phoenix fan, or Phillips fan.. but wow did they ever work hard on this! Phoenix stands alone and takes this film in as his baby. The acting / cinematography / violence / character development / setting.. all perfect!We don't deserve this film11/10"
1775,"""Joker"" Review
(9.5/10)I was close to giving this movie a ten out of ten, but then I thought to myself is it wrong for me to think that Joker is brilliant and unsettling all in one? Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix have not just reimagined one of the most iconic villains in cinema history, but reimagined the comic book movie itself.
""I just don't want to feel so bad anymore,"" whispers Arthur, who's also on seven different types of medication and has been in the system for most of his life. A system that now has no resources or time for him. A desperate whisper that you know won't be heard by anyone. That simply signifies the beginning of both a descent and his path to becoming the Joker. This is ultimately what Joker is: an origin story. One that touches only ever so lightly on what has come before in the DC Universe. This could, particularly in the current climate, be viewed as a lament for outsiders and the ignored. That's too simple and Joker does anything but deliver you easy answers. It's a sad, chaotic, slow-burn study of someone who isn't visible; who doesn't even exist to the world around them. But your empathy, sympathy even, isn't guaranteed, and it begins to dissolve as Arthur somehow moves even further to the edges. This is, we mustn't forget, the story of how a villain was made.
As Arthur/Joker, Joaquin Phoenix is astonishing. Phillips has said he had a picture of the actor above his screen when writing the script and it's a belief that has paid off. Phoenix inhabits Arthur: having lost weight for the role, he looks thin, frail, hungry. Shadows carve out his exposed bones. His physicality is precise, the way he moves, shuffles, runs, sits, smokes, shrinks. His usual intensity is on full display and it's captivating, even overwhelming in moments. While this is Phoenix's film, Frances Conroy is quietly devastating as Arthur's mother Penny, and Zazie Beetz, as neighbour Sophie Dumond, while arguably underused, brings vital humanity to her scenes with Arthur. The most talked-about piece of casting was obviously Robert De Niro as late-night TV host Murray Franklin.
Mention must be made of Joker's cello score by Hildur Guðnadóttir: mournful, dark and fractured, and the cinematography by Lawrence Sher. In his hands, Gotham is alive as a flawed, brutal, broken-hearted character in its own right.
Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways."
1776,"A true masterpiece. Incredible performance for Joaquin Phoenix that may just rival the phenomenal Heath Ledger. Todd Phillips has written an truly stunning portrayal of the crown prince of crime. The movie does everything right, even down to the pearls."
1777,"Ever thought that laughter can be misunderstood? This depiction of Joker is a personal and intimate journey into the psyche of one of the greatest villains ever created but you are gonna see only as much as he is willing to show you - and he shows a lot. As someone who struggles with mental issues, I can say this movie is not only a hit in commercial sense but it also hits way close to home. You can laugh with Joker, you can fear Joker but in this one you may yet cry for Joker."
1778,Masterpice this movie...i want to this movie one more
1779,"I though I was going to be unimpressed with this movie honestly, 'cause I had really high expectations, but I wasn't, it really is a great movie.
Joaquin's performance was truly AMAZING, give the guy some awards people, he deserves it."
1780,"***_NO_SPOILERS_***
Finally a DC movie savagely walked n sat on the Masterpiece Shelve beside ""Dark Knight trilogy"". First I thought, It would have been great if Martin Scorsese directed this film when it was announced long back, but #Todd_phillips proved he is a master in carving this Art-Emotional-Crime-SuperVillain-Drama , a little slow.. but not for me , So Deep, Dark & Psychological tale for the origin of The JOKER , Todd Phillips's previous Comedy-dramas have gave him so much experience & insight to deal this psychic comedian, and he used it perfectly.Cinematography, lighting, Set works, Editing have perfectly delivered us Retro style of Gotham city.Joaquin Phoenix is the best JOKER till date as same as Heath ledger. But if I must say who is the 1st best... it's ""Phoenix"" of course for me, hands down !! Because he showed us shades of sanity to Insanity . A full length character study throughout the duration of the film.Robert De Niro , what to say about him ? , Top notch performance as Murray.that vintage stage-dramatic music is so engaging & apt to every scene accordingly.-Over all it is one of the greatest comic based films .
Phoenix deserves best actor academy award.#NOTE : This film is not like other DC/Marvel comics based films , not even a bit, far less popcorn entertainer than ""dark Knight trilogy""... No money heists, no major chase sequences, no blasts & shootouts , no big action sequences, ...It's something like the this decade's Taxi driver (1976), The King of comedy (1982) & Man on the moon (1999). If you are only into that above entertainer kinda stuff & doesn't like little slow art type films, then better stay away from this ."
1781,"Joaquin deserve oscar for acting, writer should also deserve it and last but not the least direction of this film too. Salute to all(All member of this film."
1782,This film is phenomenal. It's commentary on certain aspects of society and mental illness will leave you in a state of reflection. Joaquin Phoenix also captures and holds your attention throughout the film in a truly mesmerizing performance. I wouldn't recommend this film for the faint of heart as it is very dark.
1783,"This is one of the best movies I have seen for a while
Pnoenix deserves oscar for this"
1784,"My two cents: The message is that people can be as disturbed as can be, but the only thing that will lead them to the light is kindness. Let's see what happens if a person gets the oppossite.Wrapped in a great movie with the greatest actor of our time."
1785,"I was on board for this movie since day one. When the first trailer came out I was shocked by how you could see the the care and detail in every shot of the movie. And, Phoenix's performance looked insane. After the final trailer I was sure this movie was going to become best movie of 2019. And, when I finally coud watch, all my expectations were fulfilled. From start to end this movie just cannot stop. You will laugh, you will get shocked, you will even cry. This is the best character study I have seen since Taxi Driver. Simply, magnificent. And that ending, well..."
1786,"The Joker is the best movie to exist. This movie is so deep and dark that you understand and feel him. This movie is incredible. Joaquin's performance is outstanding.I just... don't know how to express that this is the best movie of the century. I probably will not stop thinking about it because of the effect it has.Go watch it. I promise, you will not regret it."
1787,"This will be a short review, so I adored this movie it was a masterpiece and sends a strong message you will have to watch it to find out."
1788,What a masterpiece!Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix really nailed it
1789,"Joaquin Phoenix has given the performance of his career and that's saying something because it's Joaquin Phoenix. He has given a fresh take on the iconic villain rather than repeating any previous incarnations including the comic book versions. He has given mutiple shades of madness to his joker. Truly Oscar worthy.Direction , music , cinematography and editing are all brilliant and perfectly blended in this masterpiece. Theres a scorcese vibe throughout the move and also there is a subtle reference near the end to Heath ledger's joker in a shot which was beautiful.Joker is basically a saddening tale of abuse on people whom the mainstream soceity considers weird and what it can do to a person who in his own words has never been happy for one minute in his life.
Arthur fleck coming out and embracing his true potential of the Joker persona is symbolic to DC focusing on it's darker source materials like TDK trilogy and not try to be another MCU.In short Joker is Brilliant piece of cinema on one of the most iconic comic book villains who rightly deserves this!!"
1790,Just go and watch Joaquin Phoenix deliver one of the best performances in the history of hollywood movies... He does justice to the legend of Heath 'Joker' Ledger... Sure deserves an Oscar for this one.
1791,"After a long time a movie worth our time.
Pure storytelling and phoenix made the character come to life.
A movie for the ages..
Just go watch it , words cant describe this masterpiece"
1792,"Was waiting for this movie since January and fully satisfied, Watched first day first show.."
1793,"This movie offers you a great character study of one of the most iconic villain of all time ""THE JOKER"" and Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Philips nailed it totally. But from the point of some critics it's too violent. So what else do you expect from the origin story of a villain. Fast and furious should also be named for the reckless driving but nope,we don't do that because we have common sense"
1794,"First 5 minutes in the movie and you know it that he will nail this role!
Joaquin, you have done justice to the role and to the fans who have been desperately waiting for the right person to do this role.The whole movie just focused on the Joker, imagine how difficult his (Joaquin Phoenix) job was."
1795,All those negative reviews are wannabe activists. Must watch.
1796,"Its an amazing work of art. The acting, the storyline, the emotions all of it. Joaquin Phoenix has nailed it in this movie. However, The ending will blow your mind."
1797,What an incredibly boring movie. I left feeling so empty. Just cause he has a mental illness and and is a nutter that make him a real villain.
1798,"I was hesitant when I was going to see this because the IMDB score was so high that I honestly figured people (comic and Batman fans, DC fans, Joker fans etc..) were just rating it a 10 without seeing it. I can't remember the last time a movie has exceeded my expectations this much. In my personal opinion, this is now the best portrayal of the Joker in history....just barely edging out Heath. I honestly think Heath would be super proud!I'm not going to get into any details, because you should most definitely experience this movie first hand...the acting, cinematography, production, writing/dialogue and story are all TOP NOTCH and it is most definitely Oscar worthy....In fact, i have a feeling this movie is going to sweep the Oscar's...it is THAT good!I suggest seeing it while it is still playing in theaters, because the movie-going experience of seeing this on the big screen is second to none!"
1799,"In my opinion this movie is too disturbed.
The character of ""Joker"" is a sick person that loves to kill other people but that's not who Joker should be.
So in general, there are good parts in the movie but in total I'm disappointed by it!"
1800,"It seems a few people are upset about any advance reviewing of The Joker here. If this is you, you will not last a minute in director Todd Phillips's deranged world. Pitiful as you will miss the sheer force of Phoenix channeling the incarnate mad man. This kind of acting, story, and cinematography is not for the weak of heart. Who knows if Oscar lover's will even know the higher level of what they are looking at. My guess is, when they realize it can not be compared to Ledger's portraying, they will have to see this Jokester for what he is, our inner darkness.... Rating 9 as perfection is for liars and cowards"
1801,Don't waste your money. It was slow and boring. The end was not climatic at all and it was a poorly written plot.
1802,"Bleak, rarely entertaining, unoriginal, didn't know what it wanted to be. Was it all a dream in the end? When the lights came on in the cinema you could sense the disappointment in the audience. Stony silence. Wish I trusted my gut and didn't go. Just re-watch Heath Ledger's Joker again, honestly. At least it tries to balance art with entertainment, and doesn't just sink into the depths of pretentiousness. Phoenix does his best, but between this and: You were never really here, he needs to lighten it up a bit. Commodus in Gladiator was more interesting and well rounded."
1803,"This film has no plot. Like, at all. It just bumbles through its runtime to the point where you feel relieved when it's finally over and you can go home. It tried to present itself as a clever critique on modern society and the rise of extreme politics, but can't even do that properly. One scene everyone is pissed at the rich for treating them badly, but the next scene, these same people are being presented as bad people because they protest how they're treated. It also has scenes where the lead character imagines enjoying himself with another character that are all implied to have actually happened, and when you find they haven't (after he breaks into the apartment of the character in question), literally nothing happens to him. Everything is backwards and contradictory right from the word go. The only good thing is that Joaquin Phoenix works hard to portray the character as best he can, but that's entirely down to his skill as an actor and is nothing to do with the script (if there even was one)"
1804,"THE ONLY REASON I GIVE THIS FILM 1 STAR IS BECAUSE I COULDNT GO ANY LOWER. This movie is not a joker movie and has no relation to what the joker is. Somebody wrote a movie and slapped joker on it. Absolute crap and boring. Not convincing at all to even scare me, and I'm scared of everything."
1805,"Labored through until the halfway point (over two days) and gave up. That's an hour of my life wasted. What a depressing, preachy pile of nonsense. I watch movies to be entertained and this movie didn't come close."
1806,"A biopic about a homicidal sociopath. An insightful movie that dives into mental illness and glorifies mentally disturbed homicidal maniacs. Not sure it has any redeemable quality other than to help us understand the depravity of a mentally ill homicidal lunatic. A trophy movie for the future shooter. Great job Hollywood, not. Why is this rated highly? It is disturbing. Almost walked out."
1807,"Huge disappointment. Another way over hyped release from Hollywood. Actors acting crazy isn't hard for them. While a lot of people give Joaquin Phoenix huge rave reviews, looking at the performance with a deeper critical view reveals just a deeper level of crazy. You'd have to pay me to watch this one again. Story line was also very weak and the movie puts all of its eggs into the one basket of Joaquin Phoenix. Hollywood continues to try to outdo the previous versions of a character that by now is long worn out."
1808,"I just saw this movie about a day ago, and it completely blew me away, namely the main character, protagonist, hero? Joker. we love, hate, and or just plain utterly confused about how we feel of Joker. Joker is the greatest villain ever because he is ourselves, he is the worst of ourselves. hes the deep dark place inside you that rises to the surface eventually, and then pushed down just as fast because it terrifies you."
1809,"Two hours of my life I will never get back... the plot continues the Hollywood trend of poking fun at disabled people (and alienating those in the audience). Joaquin Phoenix clumsily over-acted throughout, his forced laugh becoming tiresome very quickly. In fact the whole film became quite tiresome."
1810,"I didnt find it exciting at all.
Bad and shallow story"
1811,Dont pay to watch this i dont know why all this attnetion this movie got. Really disapointed i wait for something ..
1812,"I was super excited when I saw the trailer. I was expecting a plot that would blow my mind, but absolutely disappointed with the storyline. The good part of the movie is the actor himself. Joaquin Phoenix really pulled off this intense character. Oscar for Phoenix!Just a perfect storyline was missing, otherwise it would be a jaw-dropping movie."
1813,"I had high hopes for this title, but sadly they werent met. I think Phoenix does an amazing job acting. But the actual movie is for me boring, tedious and predictable.
I wont say ""dont watch"" or ""do watch"". This review is purely my opinion. I have seen it, but don't need to see it ever again."
1814,"This movie makes ""Suicide Squad"" looks like a masterpiece, I don't get how anyone would relate to a mentally ill murderer like him, He strangled his mother and killed several human beings. Unleashed chaos as if the government is the problem or the system' is the problem. He simply replaced it with a more sinister reality, And If you really don't like the system you should try Chaos!.I'm fed up with movies trying to embellish gangsters and thugs, and sick criminals like those; I don't know what's so charming about them?If someone had troubles in his life there's always the right way to deal with it."
1815,"For those who are saying ""how you can rate this movie without seeing it your just a DC Fanboy"" you must not understand how the movie industry works. They allow people to screen movies early to get a feel for how audiences will receive the movie, they allow critics to see the movie early and also early screening for promotional purposes. The only reason your being ignorant to how the movie industry works is bc you don't like the political message of the film. If it was Captain Marvel you wouldn't be saying a word. This movie was fantastic especially the ending, but please see it for yourselves when available to the entire public."
1816,"Well that to tell about this movie? A great setting back in the 80s, a hard to watch path of Arther Fleck, driving into total insanity portrayed by a great Pheonix, who really lives this role of a Criminal Clown. Not as in the comics, not as in the series or movies, its whole new way, a whole new level we could watch in Venice. Its a brilliant movie, showing us the problems to solve in our modern society."
1817,Wow there's no word to describe this piece of art .
1818,"If you want to be entertained, this movie is not for you. It's a movie about a depraved, amoral, extremely violent ""clown"" with suicidal tendencies happy to see the world burn. It's completely pointless and depressing. Todd is the polar opposite of Scorsese and Nolan and this movie is a reflection of his talent. You'll get a week long hangover after watching this movie."
1819,I think Joaquin will take his first oscar award for this movie
1820,"Failed to see what all the hype was about, after 20 minutes decided to go and watch the grass grow."
1821,Definitely overrated. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is really good though.
1822,I'll start off with the good. The actor. the only good thing about the movie was Joaquin Pheonix. he played joker more amazing then anyone could've imagined. that's where the good ends. now the bad. The plot. The plot was absolutely terrible. It didn't have like any correlation to the comics at all. I did not enjoy the fact that I watched a movie about a plot that didn't even matter because it really wasn't the true origon of joker.
1823,"Sad and borring, depressive storie about mad person. Do not waste time and money, especial in friday evening, cause it will ruine your day and make it sad and uncomfortable, like autumn weather on streets."
1824,"No words for a terrible junk movie! Yet we are being led to believe that this is the most fantastic work of art in human history...Save you money, better yet go watch Terminator for the tenth time. It is definitely better..."
1825,"Based on the existing reviews I doubt many will agree but I wouldn't waste the money to see this. If I could rate this movie in multiple ways I think it'd be more helpful, and I think that's the inherent issue. Everyone is praising Phoenix for playing his ""Masterpiece"" of a role, and yes, he did a great job, but the movie as a whole sucked in my opinion. Especially considering it doesn't even fit in with the DC timeline and therefore the whole movie just doesn't make sense from that aspect."
1826,"Very poor story line, Just goes to show the power of the hype train.
JP acted brilliantly, but one performance cannot carry the whole film."
1827,"Put on a happy face and smile coz with Joker, the greatest comic-book supervillain at last gets his very own origin story, and it is exactly how it must be: Dark, bleak, deranged, manic, wretched & downright nihilistic. Also, with no good to counter the evil this time around, it is a full-on descent into madness & hysteria that viewers are either gonna detest or embrace wholeheartedly.Co-written & directed by Todd Phillips, this standalone take on the origins of the iconic arch nemesis attempts to create his psychological profile by painting a grisly portrait of an unstable mind that's hanging by a thread on the edge of insanity until he finally snaps. Discarding the existing blueprint of its genre, this reincarnation of Joker offers a low-budget, grounded treatment but with hugely rewarding dividends.Though Phillips' direction could dig into Joker's unhinged persona to only a certain extent, Joaquin Phoenix's chilling rendition of the eponymous psychopath bridges the gap and overcomes the few nitpicks with thrilling intensity, for he is gripping & breathtaking throughout. Other vital inputs come from the story's nihilistic tone & treatment, its grim atmosphere, sudden brutal violence, and Hildur Guðnadóttir's haunting score.Scarier than most horror films of today, Joker bestows the notorious madman with an origin story that's as plausible as it is cold & callous, and makes for an insanely riveting character study that works even if one strips the premise off its comic book roots. Driven by Joaquin Phoenix's powerful, unsettling & memorable performance, this cautionary tale of a psychotic who in search for identity mistakenly becomes a symbol is arguably the best film of the year."
1828,"Wow ! I'll be honest that I did not expect this one to live up to the hype, but it did. We've been overdue on having a proper masterpiece film out there and this one delivers. A movie that causes you to think and still leaves you thinking about why those events happened in the film or even real life. Leaves you thinking about why it's important to know both sides of a situation - of course this is a lesson that the Batman lore has always had, hence the villains having interesting backstories. There's so much to take in with this film, did you ever expect that from a comic book movie ? Much less a DC film ?! Batman has always been (to me at least) the most interesting story in the comic book world, because the villains are as interesting (if not more) than the hero. So many film adaptations have been made, but this one finally does an outstanding job exploring the story's most complex character. Joaquin Phoenix deserves all the praise for his take on this character. He got the mannerisms, looks, and ticks of a mentally unstable person down to a T, it's so natural and not cheesily forced - the guy is phenomenal. Whether people like it or not, we needed this film. No matter if you're part of the overly sensitive brigade that censors everything or an online edgelord who mocked this film for critiquing sOciEty, you need to watch this film - there's a valuable lesson in it for both of you. This is one of the greatest films that has come out in this decade. Congrats to the whole team who made it possible, outstanding job !"
1829,"Yes, the film has some dangerous elements to it given the current climate of human sanity in general. But this film is a perfect origin story for a villain. The story is perfect as is the acting by the lead role. For what this film is intended to be, it absolutely nails it."
1830,Simply an amazing movie and Please don't compare it to the other jokers and enjoy the mind sickness and darkness.
1831,"This is a slow movie, but there are violent scenes of action throughout to keep you interested. This movie is not ""that"" violent, but it is the most violent movie based on a DC character. You see people get shot in the head with blood flying out, people getting their heads smashed in with brains showing, and well as people getting got multiple times in the chest.This movie has some good twist and turns I didn't see coming and it has a great final act.9/10"
1832,To be honest I was not a fan of this solo Joker movie because I knew that if it were to be a success then people will start relating the Joker to Arthur Fleck.In my opinion the Clown Prince of Crime should not get a proper back story. That uncertainty behind his past is one of the things that makes this character so interesting.But whatever they have done here in this movie is amazing. The reason for Joker's grudge against the bat was something that we have all wondered about. They have explained the reasons here beautifully. The theater response was pretty positive during that reveal. So bat fans need not worry.Joaquin Phoenix begins as a semi lunatic and initially I did not very much like the character. However by the end he becomes a full blown psycho and the acting goes up by some notches once he puts the Joker make up on. The final 30 minutes are a must watch.Orchestra deserves special mention. Spine chilling music at crucial moments.Overall it's a dark toned film where we see someone who despises the society (especially bcoz of what it does to him) and loses his 'life' and mind in the process. It's also interesting that the film reminded me about Taxi Driver which is one of my favorite films. Robert De Niro who nailed that role plays a pretty decent part in this film too.Verdict: Slightly sadistic but beautifully crafted movie. Oscar contender for sure.
1833,"If you are looking for action, adventure I would not watch this movie..
It is nothing like any of the other DC series.If you are looking for a psychological thriller. I would not watch this movie either.
There are no twists and bounds, here you know he will eventually become the ""Joker""Many of the small things that happen in this movie have nothing to do with his character development.
It's simply not there.Things that do, also make no sense at all. Like if his mom is crazy, why is he crazy he was adopted...In the end does he doesn't even become the joker just some guy that accidentally killed 3 people then didn't feel about it.
There was NO wittyness about anything he did. It was either accidental or blunt, like he didn't care.His jokes weren't even mildly trying to be funny he just laughed all the time apparently according to a ""medical condition""Over all super disappointing."
1834,Hollywood has lost it's mind making this and so has DeNiro and Phoenix.
1835,"Basically just surface level fare for audiences that crave some shock value but aren't willing to go looking for something better, or deeper.I didn't feel much of anything the entire duration, indifference turning to eventual boredom.The last act definitely gave me something more to work with, but by that point i'd already lost all interest and just wanted to get out of there.Joaquin is always good at playing unhinged, but i'd pass on this performance any day of the week for his turn in The Master, or even You Were Never Really Here. The former film has what this never could: nuance, intrigue and something to say. And the latter one does a more entertaining job of being an empty art film genre blender."
1836,"This film is loathsome vile trash that betrays every possibility of powerful storytelling or message it comes in contact with. The Joker is a villain, a personification of evil. That is Not a character to use to explore how society treats the mentally ill socially unable or persecuted. This movie will give rise to hate and fear of the ill and powerless and make heroes of tragic unfortunate people who do monstrous things. Had Arthur retreated into the Joker as a fictional character he then took on, this movie might actually be saying something real. If there had been any moment of true choice between good and evil for a oppressed person to choose to become a violent oppressor of the innocent as well as guilty then That would have been saying something real. Instead the writer and director of the film puts his own Joker fantasy up there murdering both the archetypal myth power and the examination of social ills he is juggling around in an attempt to get fame and attention. And like for Arthur it will work. Sort of. For awhile. But we the audience and society at large are left with Penny and Sophie and the copycat clowns fates. I'm not really sure which is the worst end of that deal."
1837,"Whilst the acting is superb, this movie could do without the whole Joker ""sauce"" being poured on the story.It revolves about a man gliding off into madness in a society that does not care about providing sufficient help for his problems. As his medications and little therapy he got were taken away due to budget cuts, he goes further and further into the Abyss of his madness. Phoenix does a wonderful job portraying the protagonist!Unfortunately this movie would have so been much better without the Joker/Batman elements. It is difficult to believe that this weak man we see in this movie turns out to be the crime kingpin that we love and fear. As such it did not meet up to my expectations."
1838,Well someone said Roma was boring wait till you see this overrated mess.
1839,It was the best time-spending this year!! I've felt total atmosphere of actions and I'm so happy! You must check it out !!!
1840,"Overrated movie of all time,The reviews here are making this film out to be far better than it actually is."
1841,"Wasted my time watching this movie.
The movie tried to create a tragic character, however I could not sympathize. The live of Arthur isn't that bad. Lots of ppl would do everything for such a life in a first world country.
Arthur is crazy, yes, but even that was nothing special. What a waste of time making this a movie."
1842,"Let me make it clear at first. I'm not a fan of superhero movies and Marvel comics. I actually didn't think Dark Knight was a masterpiece either. So I was so looking forward to this movie when I realized this is not a superheroic-avengers-batman movie type, but actually is a psychological study using the famous and complex character ""Joker"". So even before watching Philips' movie I was a fan.But Joker's plot is actually very shallow with plot holes and it never gets deep (tries hard to but always fails), you never buy anything that happens or things that lead things to happen, it's hard to sympathize with Arthur, Joaquin Phoenix is my favorite actor but he's so tied up with the overly acted Method thing. Other characters are poorly written, it wouldn't matter if they never existed. This is actually a VERY POOR character development, while the whole movie must be about character developing! What happens in the end has nothing to do with ""the Joker"" and mostly it looked like a stupid show which you think you have to like! I had a hard time to believe this is actually ""Joker"" and how he was made! The costume and good makeup doesn't make him Joker enough!To me Todd Philips tried hard to make a Scorsese-Nolan type of movie! But he doesn't get even close to them and that's why this movie doesn't look original and is a good copy at its best. It would be better if it was longer. Even the trailers are totally teasing the last 10 minutes of the movie. Either it's just a commercial thing or the director doesn't believe in what he has made himself.I know that this movie shouldn't/couldn't be compared with the Dark Knight or the Batman (1989). But still..near Ledger's Joker, Joaquin's Joker is a joke!"
1843,"""kill your mom"" ""kill your idol"" ""kill your love"" Kill everyone who hates you? for no reason wow what a stupid message by drunken idiot todd Phillips. i thought this Joker will be better than Heath ledger. Joaquin acting wasn't even good in this movie. Stupid Fruitcakes dialogues and overreaction doesn't make him good actor or oscar worthy lol keep dreaming😂 and fanbabies are justexaggerating this pointless Piece of crap he is definitely Unworthy for oscar. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY for this cinamatic Disaster"
1844,"The Film doesn't deserve it's age recommendation, it's heavily brutal and bloody.The story itself is very flat, not much deeper then about a person who has to laugh when feeling bad/sad.Nevertheless it's really well played. The actors are damn good, sound editing, cut, ... really good artists there :)"
1845,"I respect everyone's opinion in regards to the movie, I just wished the production focused a lot more on the actual storyline and proper adaptation to the Joker character we've know since we were young. It's a 10 out of 10 for the acting and picture quality, not arguing that a single bit. However, the storyline itself is just not all there per se. The performance from the cast was absolutely marvelous, I just hope the production comes out with a second movie to correct the mistakes on this one."
1846,"After waiting in anticipation for months, I finally got to see this film. I have to admit I was not impressed. This movie other then the last 10 to 19 minutes may as well have been a basic mentel disorder movie. This is not a JOKER movie. I understand at it's core it was not supposed to be, they have succeeded in making the film they wanted to make. Though it's just not a very entertaining or watchable film. Of course the way things go now days this film will be considered a classic. The ending for one thing was so obvious that it was cringe worthy, this was supposed to be an original film, it fell short in this regard. The premise of this film sounded so good, and to be honest this had the makings of a good to great film, but the direction this film goes in makes this film a farce."
1847,"I cannot understand why there are so many 10 out of 10's for this movie. I have rated it a 1 to compensate for the overly high ratings of many people on here, I would probably give it a 6 normally. Highly overrated. Very slow, and very dull, and depressing. The last half an hour was ok, but I didn't find the story very believable in the least. I found it to be painful to watch in many places. I will not be watching this movie again."
1848,The message this film promotes towards society isnt what I had hoped. Cinematography and acting are excellent.
1849,"This was not as good as people put it out there to be. It may be a cultural thing. Who knows. I didn't appreciate the movie. The storyline was good. the actors were not. They picked people that couldn't act. It just felt like theh were trying too hard. I might have to take another look at it, but for now I am disappointed."
1850,This is by far one of the best films I've seen for a long long time . Went and watched it tonight and its unbelievable. Its brilliant and hats off to mr Phoenix bravo that's acting at the top brilliant . Don't listen to reviews from this one and that don't listen to the clowns on twitter . Best film this year I'd say film in the last 10 years amazing go see it
1851,"I had high expectations from this movie considering the past history of Joker's character, however this turned out to be waste of my time and money."
1852,"Everything about Joker apart from the performance from Phoenix was fine. The score was pretty good as well I guess. However, does having these things make it a masterpiece. Nah lol"
1853,"Joker is a near two hour, dark, somber, cinematic masterpiece, where we witness the origin of the greatest Batman villains of all time, and understand in great depth, what made him what he is. We can see why Phoenix won the Academy Award, as this great actor has done such a great volume of work, and this is his movie to shine. He does so much with his character, a brave acting feat. The movie too, plays Jokes on you, as you'll see. Granted, Joker is dark, but is just totally engrossing from start to finish, no matter where you watch it. We praise the joker's murderous actions too. De Niro as a scummy t.v. show host isn't shown enough, and we almost forget him, as being so engaged with Phoenix's brilliant take on the super villain. Joker is a deep character study, of alienation, humiliation, twisted imaginings, rejection, all those negatives. He isa truly tortured soul, his family history only amplifying that torture. The music is eerily terrific, and we so feel for poor old Arthur Fleck. The dark piece, had me laughing a few times, at some lines, and Phoenix's laugh though a trifle annoying, you wanna hear more. Way more than any other movie, this is one that demands your attention. No joke."
1854,"I watched movie 2 times, I must say acting, soundtrack, and story were unreal."
1855,"This is not a superhero movie, but an incredible artful statement on humanity with a cape thrown over it. While we celebrate movie after movie of these singular dimensional computer filled comic book fluff Todd Philips comes along and makes art out of this era's epidemic of mental illness, isolation, and loss of society. Phoaquin Phoenix is heartbreaking and chilling in his soulful version of the Joker. It's a mirror held up to humanity, to what we view makes hero's and villains. To make a sequel would ruin everything this art piece has to say."
1856,"Mesmerizing, the camera angles, the acting, the story, the pace, the content to sum everything up its pure magic. Grateful to have been able to get this to watch."
1857,"... Joker ... - From a DC Comic book: is a grandiose movie if there is one, produced in a sensational way by ""Todd Phillips"" who knew how to make an incredibly realistic human impact, without ever taking lose sight of this vision of a sick society, which despises and destroys the most vulnerable, and simply lets appear a deep evil lurking in the shadows and which feeds on the vulnerability of a growing class of the most humble of our society, which acts like a poison that slowly infuses to end up intoxicating a society that is losing more and more of all these benchmarks.The movie is brought to the zenith by the exceptional performance of Joaquin Phoenix (Joker) who bursts the screen from the first to the last frame, giving even more power to this exceptional movie.
Be careful, our society is sick and like cancer it infects the cogs of our society, which one wonders how ... it does not even realize it today."
1858,If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win an Oscar for this then the Academy Awards will be a laughing stock even more than what it is now
1859,This man has left me absolutely speechless. I'm usually someone that talks to the movies - A LOT. But from the very beginning I didn't say a single word. This man deserves to have a great future. And the storyline - a masterpiece. Thank you for blessing my eyes and ears.
1860,"This is the best movie i have ever seen!
Just watch it and Im not goona say anything!"
1861,"A comic book movie about mental healt, abandonement and society. Director todd philips and Joaquin Phoenix have nailed it. A must watch for movie lovers."
1862,This movie will be remembered for a long long long time..
1863,"This movie was magnificent. It touched on a lot of issues we normally sweep under the rug and turn a blind eye to. In no way is violence the answer but recognizing when we have isolated someone, mocked, ridiculed, bullied, and disregarded those with mental illnesses and change how we see people who are different, a lot of callousness in the world may end. The system failed Arther (Joker) and in reality it fails many others."
1864,"The Joker turned out to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. Joaquin is so believable, so real, so present that I honestly felt uncomfortable: like watching the movie was like intruding on someones private life. This felt a lot more like a documentary than anything else. so raw. so devastating and sad. I felt his pain and outrage pour out through the screen: it was easy to empathise with him and his suffering. If Joaquin does not get an oscar for this I will be outraged."
1865,"I loved the acting but movie is Overhyped.
Story is not upto the mark . They should have sticked to the original comic book origin of the joker instead of this . I have a seven just for the acting of Joaquin he is the only reason movie is a little good."
1866,"It is safe to say that this movie is not for everyone. DC fan or not, this is about the origin of one of the most notorious characters in entertainment. So far in previous movies we have only seen the clown prince of crime Joker. The criminal who went crazy and took things so far. But here the story is the origin of the mentally sick Joker, the simple man who had a rough life and started to act on his own will instead of acting according to what people expect. This movie is dark and grim, it is a dramatic tale and an excellent performance by Joaquin Phoenix and everyone in the cast. They made it look so real and relatable to our life that the idea of a real life joker is not far fetched any more.
I hope that DC continues in this direction and give us a new approach to the stories we love."
1867,"This is not your typical comic book movie. In fact it couldn't be further from it. This is a very different take on one of the most iconic film/comic book characters in history. And does it deliver? Absolutely, it's so good. A brilliant character peice.Thoroughly deserving of it's rating, Joker is a dark and twisted origin story with a no holds barred depiction of mental illness and a complete unravelling of the human mind. Hard to show this in 2 hours but the film delivers this incredibly well. You really feel Jokers pain. Much of this is due to Jacquin Phoenix. He will surely win an Oscar for his role. He's in every scene and crushes it. I never thought anybody could get near Heath Ledgers performance but I believe he's done it. Of course Heath never got the chance to play the Joker in his own movie so hard to compare. Until Ledger, I thought most depictions were too camp but his and especially this one is more of what I'd expect. Joker is severely deranged, dangerous and he shows it here.As for the plot we see Arthur Fleck aka The Joker living at home with mum struggling with work, relationships and life in general. From here his life spirals out of control and eventually the Joker is born. I won't go into specifics but in between the magic just happens.There is not a heap of violence but what's there is gritty, bloody and dark unlike anything I've seen from DC.Directed by Todd Phillip's who is best known for comedies like the Hangover. He's done an amazing job here and an Oscar may come his way also.One small issue I have is the chronology with Bruce Wayne who is 11 in this but Joker seems to be mid forties. I always just assumed they were of similar age? I'm sure the magic of film will correct this.They simply must follow this film up in the Batman franchise and pit this version of Joker with Batman. Boy will that be awesome and I'll be first in line for a ticket.Other reviews have been similar to this one but go see for yourself, you won't be disappointed9/10Masterpiece"
1868,"The beginning is slow for a reason, it shows you how he becomes who he is. It is sad and interesting and Joaquin is truly amazing in this film.
9.2 rating."
1869,"Hopefully a remedy to an increasingly soulless industry, although it's attempt to personify our societal issues will be sure to leave you feeling hapless and empty. What critics don't seem to accept is the value in a movie not leaving you skipping out of the theatre, it seems addressing modern issues head-on has become far too 'problematic' for our film commissars these days. If you'd rather bury your head in the sand, Disney is always waiting with another reincarnation of whatever the money people conjure up next."
1870,"In a time with an extreme amount of flashy superhero movies, this movie sets out to be an example of a more realistic touch to the genre."
1871,"This film is raw, dark, and honest. You never quite feel empathy for Arthur, but you do sometimes find a bit of sympathy for him never crossing the line into being ok with him. From the very first 1 minute he is awkward, creepy and clearly on edge. You're always uncomfortable.The build up is fantastic, and each part of the story was a major factor in the finale.EPIC"
1872,"Joker doesn't open with the DC logo, seemingly proud to not announce its affiliation. Instead the film begins not as a film trying to shake its comic book roots but rather as a film that wants to be taken seriously. The film has far too many references to other Joker/Batman lore that to say it's not a comic book movie would be a fallacy. Just like the recently released Ad Astra this is a film that draws heavily from the films, themes and feelings of movies released in the late 70's by the new wave of film-school filmmakers.Joker by all appearances draws heavily from Scorsese with particular inspiration coming from Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy. Two films about overlooked people on the margins of society who take to extreme measures in order to be noticed. These are obvious oversimplifications of these films as it is, indeed, an oversimplification of Joker to solely compare it to them. Joker has a lot to say, particularly about the ""systems"" treatment of mental health and the redistribution of wealth.Whilst the film could be read as a call to action and militarisation of the bottom rungs of society it seems to me to be more of a condemnation of healthcare in the United States. The non-treatment of mental health sufferers, the inaction of social services and the greed of the elite are all startlingly relevant themes that plague the US. The film could seen as a call to arms for the right but really it's a film rooted in the left, it's a call for socialistic reform in a country plagued by violent, mentally unstable people that have created a culture of mass shootings.All of this in a film that's pretty good. It does struggle along for a while and really doesn't find its feet until the third act. The tension breaks in the end but the first two acts don't fully create a sense of strain that quite deserves this descent into chaos. Phoenix is stellar and gives us a Joker that for me made me feel very uncomfortable for much of the film. The supporting cast (Robert DeNiro, Zazie Beetz, Marc Maron, Frances Conroy and Brett Cullen) are largely underused and their characters underserved. As much as this is a ""Joker"" movie I would have loved some more time with some of the other characters.I think the film loses points for how much it leans on other films and how long it takes to get going. That said it's a stylish movie that's very well made and finally demonstrates Todd Phillips ability as a filmmaker. The shot choices are fantastic and a shout out has to be given to the soundtrack which is both really catchy and creates stark contrasts with what's on the screen.The origin story we never asked for but the filmmaking leap Todd Phillips needed:4/5 stars"
1873,"From the ""music"" to the endless closeups of Joaquin Phoenix's contorting face and body, the Director makes all of his choices as if trying to make sure you know that this guy is weird, and potentially dangerous. I mean he could have personally come out saying what he wanted to say and this movie would have been subtler.And the whole ""Thomas Wayne is your dad"" twist... probably the cheapest shot I've ever seen in any movie. Showing young Bruce in the fence, making Alfred be somewhat of a bad guy, and for sake showing the alley shooting AGAIN. Just cheap shot after cheap shot.Everything about this movie is right in your face, no subtlety, no implied meaning, no meaning at all. Strip out the Joker and DC connection, loose the on the nose choices, and this might have been a great movie about the seriousness of mental illness. Instead, it's not. It's boring, cheap, and an attempt to meaning that falls flat."
1874,"Read the reviews- they say his performance is hard to watch, that's because it was horrible and unwatchable. They tried to play up the hype by talking about violence. There was 1.5 minutes of violence in the first hour and twenty minutes.
Maybe I am not the best judge of cinematic entertainment. I thought once upon a time in Hollywood was the worst movie of the year and it got high ratings. To me Gladiator and stripes are good movies. I was looking forward to this movie because it was an origin movie about a mentally ill bad guy. 1 star. He totally ruined the character that was made legendary by health ledger, who is rolling over in his grave."
1875,"I think this is my first review, but I must do this because the movie is overrated. That anarchy thing, these socialists envying rich people and so, it can't be a leitmotif. Who's next? the Che Guevara shooting civils I think (this was real at least).
This is not the Joker we know and it doesn't fit in all that repetitive mental illness scenes."
1876,This was a complete waste of time. 2 hours of watching a man with a mental disability get beaten around in a desperate attempt by the director to allay pity towards the lead anti-hero.Added to the 'Not worth torrenting ' list
1877,You people are just as delusional as Arthur fleck this is not a good movie at all just bad
1878,"I fell for the hype which I usually treat with scepticism. An hour in and I was itching to walk out. I stuck it out but that was a mistake. I give it 3 stars because Phoenix is very good. It is a depressing movie with no real plot other than a studio version of an art house ""descent into madness"". There's a tenuous link to Batman and an ending that leaves the door open for a sequel which I will avoid like the plague.
Save your money and avoid this one too!!"
1879,"Boring, pretentious, and highly predictable. If you need a movie to help you fall asleep this is a great choice."
1880,"Right out of the gate you can forget about considering this a comic book movie. It may be based on a comic book character, but the character development and story line can be taken right from the pages of modern day horrors brought about by poverty, abusive parents, disrespect for authority, the distance between the haves and the have-nots, and an uncaring society at large. With a plot often times structured on ambiguity, the film explores the troubled mind of one Arthur Fleck, brilliantly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix in what may eventually go down as the crowning achievement of his acting career. No offense intended to Jokers who have gone before, but Phoenix's take on the character now becomes the standard for others to follow, but virtually impossible to match. I must say, the hype engendered by the film prior to it's release relative to the amount of violence portrayed appears to be seriously overstated. Yes, there is violence on Arthur Fleck's part, all of it gruesome, but it virtually pales in comparison to what one might experience in any chapter of the 'Saw' series for example, or any number of slasher/gore flicks that rely on buckets of blood to 'entertain' fans of that persuasion. Together, director Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix have created a complex character and a complex film dealing with the horrific and sordid side of mental illness that finds it's release in savage, sociopathic behavior. Though he may be called the Joker, as Arthur Fleck himself would surely attest, ""...no one's laughing now""."
1881,"There's nothing bad about Joker.But at the same time, there isn't too much to write home about either.
Joker is more of a movie that you just watch than a movie you experience. Arthur Fleck's is very distant, and a lot of the movie is watching him do weird things (like dance, or put on make up) to Frank Sinatra type music. This has the effect of telling the audience what to feel instead of making them actually feel it.
And it doesn't help that you you pretty much know everything that going to happen.But is definitely better than Suicide Squad."
1882,"I'm surprised so many people actually liked this movie with many giving it 10 out of 10, however everyone is entitled to their opinion so I accept some people really enjoyed this movie. Personally I went in with high expectations as I know Joaquin Phoenix is a great actor & even in this movie it is clear he is a talented actor, however the most important thing in any movie is how the story is told & for me who is a fan of this genre I simply did not enjoy how this long drawn out story was told.
It is interesting to see how people can see a movie completely differently to other movie fans, as all forms of art are subjective but for me I did not enjoy this at all."
1883,"Never have you seen a film like this. Joaquin in his career peak and the best acting I've seen since the Machinist.. magnificent, magical, and more entertainment than you've had all year. *** JOKER ***"
1884,"Overall satisfied. Truly amazing acting, story, direction, emotions, drama everything is perfect in the movie."
1885,This movie is a snooze fest. I can't believe people actually said this was a great movie. 2 hours of my life I will never get back.
1886,"In a time when everything is about special effects, l enjoyed watchinga character develop without the distraction of explosions and super powers.
I still like Heath Ledger's Joker better but this is a close second."
1887,"The dramatic tension is so great that it is not limited to the contrast between the rich and the poor, the strong and the weak. The poor are bullying, and the weak are weak. The world is already a cruel dark jungle. And at the bottom of the bottom, a ""freak"" that is incompatible with society, stepped into madness step by step by thousands of people, and turned into a Joker who ignited the group's violent carnival. The clown is not a Facebook villain. His uncontrollable laughter and inner grief can make you tremble. You can feel the pain that is suppressed to the extreme will be transformed into the power of destruction extremely naturally. There is the possibility of such insanity under the same circumstances."
1888,A rollercoaster of emotions. Not everyone can understand the concept of this movie. One of the best performances!
1889,"What we are seeing is the widening wealth gap, the high concentration of political and economic power and cultural power in televisions; the failure of thorough communication between people in the run-down cities, and the already miserable underlying society. Cruel mutual harm. If the patterning of these background details is mild and still interacts to a certain degree with the protagonist, then the most vivid social description in the film is highly rigid. The bottom group, with clowns as the cultural banner, was able to raise their arms in search of equality at first, but was later presented as the ""Wuhe people"" which is most easily understood in the patchwork."
1890,"Its definitely not for everyone, and it could be hard to watch for some people, but Joker brilliantly tells a story never told before about the harsh reality of our world and the true tribulations behind daily life, accompanied by Phoenix's Oscar-worthy performance."
1891,This movie is a master piece. What a brilliant performance by lead actor Mr.phoenix
1892,"While I've watched many of the superhero movies that have come down the pike,
they are often the same. So the compensation for sensational plots involves great special effects and non-stop action. They are fun and I don't mean to dis them. What is missing is a truly psychological drama. We don't get into the heads of the characters. This film is incredible as we watch a man confront his demons. We see him made fun of, attacked, and beaten. When he responds, he is seen as crazy. He also find that he is diminished in the eye of a counselor, and his mother has kept a secret. I thought it gave us a foundation for the Batman mythos without getting to deeply into it. Acting, atmosphere, and a sophisticated plot makes this a really excellent film."
1893,"One of the best movie of the year.
Joaquin Phoenix's acting is outstanding."
1894,"Emotional. Acting, dancing, fight, romance, comedy, betrayal, yelaathlayum dhool kelapeetaru."
1895,"The dark path is essentially the entire plot of the movie. In no way does this Joker pull himself together to be the devious plotter that the character is supposed to be. The artistry is good, but Joaquin's depiction looks more like bad acting than awkward social skills. Remember, Joker is supposed to be a master manipulator. He looks fantastic as Joker, but the mannerisms just aren't quite right. At least it's better than Jared Leto's depiction."
1896,"This movie is a masterpiece. It literally shows how it feel to be depressed. We are following the perspective of Arthur Fleck (Joker) who is Batmans greatest villain in the comics. But in this movie we're actually rooting for him, and we're understand his choices.I think that this film has its bad reviews because it's not an typical American movie where it's a hero and a villain, and the hero wins in the end, and the villains is getting punished. Arthur is such a great anti-hero."
1897,"Went into this film knowing it was going to be good but I totally underestimated it, joker is nothing short of a masterpiece and Phoenix's portrayal of Arthur fleck/joker is truly mesmerizing and at times pretty disturbing. Awesome flik"
1898,Joaquin Phoenix was bloody good here DEFFO deserved the oscar. Proper nutty.My favourite batman universe movie of all time. Not mad on the other ones.T_dog reviews
1899,"I guess all the kids who hail this as a masterpiece have never seen Taxi Driver. There are way better dark brooding psychological descent into madness because society sucks movies out there. After about 20 minutes I lost interest in this movie, because by that time everything it has say was already said and done. Vapid storytelling for people who've never seen a world without facebook and google.
Joaquin's performance is the only redeeming quality. Still, his performance in The Master (2012) was better, ofcourse amplified by the late master himself, Philip Seymour Hoffman.Will not rewatch The Joker ever again. Once was more than enough. I might rewatch Taxi Driver again soon, to wash this overhyped nonsense out of my mind."
1900,"This is without doubt the best performance of any actor I've ever seen.. truly amazing.
The film is pure brilliance, though disturbing, and I also found it unbelievably sad tooJoequin Phoenix is absolutely outstanding"
1901,"Believe the hype! Believe the Oscars! A brilliantly written, acted and shot psychological drama showing the descent of a sad, lonely, mentally troubled man into complete and utter insanity that just happens to be a comic book character. Perfect.Would love to see sequels featuring Batman through the eyes of Arthur Fleck. Let's turn the genre on it's head and see the hero as the 'villain' of the piece through the troubled mind of the 'hero'!"
1902,"Phoenix is awesome......nothing more to say
Two hours and hes in every scene leading from the front"
1903,"Acting, lighting, camera work, atmosphere.
I'm no film critic or officianado but this us a work of genius on every level. Just a superb film."
1904,"I have no words to describe this masterpiece, i'm not a fan of super heroes movie but Joker is one of the best movies i've ever seen for sure."
1905,"I really loved this batman movie best one yet that one scene when batman and alfred were talking for like 5 minutes, Absolutely amazing I laughed so much at that I recommend seeing this batman movie the joker didnt appear so much, which isnt so bad as it is a batman movie and there were more important characters in this batman movie."
1906,"It's nice to see that Hollywood isn't just about special effects, aliens and saving the world.
Hoaquin Phoenix is a real artist."
1907,"Very good acting performance - but the movie itself left a lot to be desired. How to make a 2 hour movie all about one role/actor? Dont. There was so much attention paid to the Joker role that all the other participants in the movie were overlooked and it left the movie shallow and devoid of depth. It was obvious from early on what was going on and I was thinking ""I can see where this is going"" and I was right. It was like going to see Laurence Olivier in Richard 3rd on the stage - you know exactly what you are going to get - it is all about his performance. But IMO a movie that attempts such a feat will always fall flat - because the 'feel' between stage and film as so vastly different. To all the millenials today - if you liked the acting performance in this movie go watch a good Broadway stage play - get over the comic movies and learn how to live."
1908,"I work in psychology, and the Joker is my favorite villain. As such, I have high standards and had high expectations after all the hype. This movie did not disappoint! The step-by-step plot creation and alignment was thorough and impressive. Joaquin was flawlessly cast and brilliantly performed."
1909,Who are these guys rating this wonderful movie at 59?
1910,"The real Oscar winner... and you all know it...
Just a perfect piece of fine art in all ways.
MUST WATCH!"
1911,"When i read people's reaction saying don't believe the hype or the character doesn't stay true to the comics, i would say that, those people are the ones that do not understand what this movie is trying to do.
This is not a comic book adaptation of the joker story, this is a story of a the downfall of a human being who falls into madness because of all the bad stuff that he experiences in his life while all he wants is to be accepted by society.
The story is well written and the acting of Joaquin phoenix is just out of this world, its that good.
To see an actor so determined to make his character believable for the adience is amazing and fascinating to watch and he deserves all the credit for his oscar winning performance.
For me this is a true masterpiece, one wich we don't see to often anymore.
If you expect to see a comic book, action loaded, super hero/villain movie then you will be dissapointed but if you on the other hand are interested in a psychological drama and want to know how a person can become so estranged from the normal world and turns into a character that despite him being totally imsane, you actually care and respect the him and understands why he does what he does then you are in for a treat because this is truly a mesmerising experience, that you will remember for a long time.
A true modern day masterpiece and an excellent milestone in movie makingA massive 10/10 for me"
1912,"WOW!!! ""JOKER"" what can be said that hasn't already?
It's an instant CLASSIC & a true masterpiece of cinema with one of the greatest performances in cinema history too from the incredible JOAQUIN PHOENIX & another great performance from the legendary Robert De Niro!!!
This movie i can relate to & i think lots of people will to, it's a powerful film & I've felt like how he feels & mental illness is an extremely hard thing to live with especially in a cold dark & nasty world like it is!!!!
A mesmerising movie!!!
The music was fantasticly moody & the cinematography was outstanding & captured the old fashioned gritty, grimy & crime infested & decaying Gotham city of 1981!!!
This Brilliant movie was part Psychological Drama & part Dark Crime Thriller, it was a mesmerising viewing & pretty much incredible in every single way!!!
I got vibes of old school greats such as Charles Bronson's 1974 Urban vigilante Thriller DEATH WISH, I also felt vibes from Martin Scorsese's 1976 Physiological Vigilante Thriller TAXI DRIVER & I'm sure there's other's that felt similar in look & story.
I felt ""Joker"" really did feel like a movie made in the 70's or very early 80's as that much care was MADE in the details & grimy urban tuxture of every location, i felt dirty just watching it & that's how well crafted & expertly made this Masterpiece was.Joaquin Phoenix is Phenomenal as Arthur Fleck the struggling Comedian with an extremely sad & horrific past, he also suffers really bad with his mental health & has a condition of severe laughter when nervous or upset, it's an astonishing performance a raw piece of acting on screen that is shocking & full of realism!!!
This movie felt real & feels like it can happen & has happened & will happen as it's darkness & themes are so relevant today...now!!!
I totally enjoyed this modern masterpiece & totally agree with all the huge praise this got & the awards it won. Truly OUTSTANDING piece of filmmaking that made me feel emotional & sorry for what Arthur has gone through in his terrible life but also how he goes isn't the best way but again it's totally understandable & i bet his actions will continue debate for years!!! A stone cold gritty Classic"
1913,It has shown the majority of the people well in this movie. The songs were wonderful. The last time I heard such songs was from Amir Tataloo the Iranian rapper who has demonstrated the society exactly like the joker movie and even better.
1914,I thought it had been overrated but was blown away by the story about Arthur Fleck. I noticed not few similarities to My own life. So the experience was a mix between being sad and horrified. Great performance by Mr Phoenix Who with this role rises like... Well a phoenix
1915,"SYNOPSIS:
Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) suffers from Pseudobulbar Affect (condition that causes you to laugh uncontrollably) and is seen as an outcast of society. He's trying to make it as a stand-up comedian, but after one violent incident he becomes a psychopathic murderer.REVIEW:
This is a very dark film that really works in so many ways. I didn't connect all the way with the film, however. At times the film very much drags and I actually liked it a little less on a second viewing.
POSITIVES:
The directing and cinematography in this film were next level. So many stellar shots and Todd Phillips really captures the essence of Gotham and how that world is. The color palette of the film gives real emotion to the atmosphere. Starting as a warmer and blurred vision while Arthur was an innocent man trying his best to move along And then the transition to a colder blue and clarity when he starts to turn and stay off his meds indicating a misguided idea of clarity while off of his medication. I loved the divide in classes in this film showing how those in poverty are seen as more chaotic and less important. This commentary is so true when you consider how we glorify entertainers in a near toxic way. The way that the writing really has you trying to figure out what's real and what's not is so smart and clever. It adds so much to the film and show what Phillips has the potential to do.
JOAQUIN PHOENIX:
Yea, so this performance also deserves its own category. I'm not sure if it was Todd Phillips or Joaquin Phoenix that decided to give Arthur the condition, but that was a tier-1 decision. I can't imagine another actor being able to do what Phoenix did in this film. This performance is one that will be shown in acting classes for years to come.
NEGATIVES:
the biggest thing with this film is that it can drag. A lot of shots that the film sits on for a little too long. I understand it the build up to see the full 180 from Joker, but it didn't add much for me. Maybe this isn't a very credible observation, because this is one of those films that feels a bit long for me, but there not a single scene I'd take out. Similarly with Avengers: Endgame (although I liked Endgame much more). I felt this way after my first viewing and so I wanted to give it a second shot and I felt the same way on round 2. Even more so.
CONCLUSION:
This film is definitely a technically well made film with very good directing, editing, acting, cinematography, score, etc.. There a few memorable scenes in this film that people will re-watch over and over. I wish I could end it on that, but this film, although barely edging out 2 hours, I felt it went on a little long. I did like the transformation and not enough can be said about Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix on this one. 7.2/10."
1916,"This movie blew me away. I've seen all the Batman movies, Suicide Squad, Superman, Wonder Woman, etc. This IS NOT LIKE THEM.
This is the smartest, psychological deterioration of a character I've ever seen. Within minutes you're feeling for Arthur. His awkwardness, his frailty, his degrading psychosis is amazing.
I've always been a Joaquin fan, but this is a master class on method.
So dark. So brilliant.
Don't expect a DC action movie here, it's not that type of movie. But do expect to think differently about all those villains you've ever seen going up against the caped crusader. You will forget that this is about Gotham City and based on a comic. This could be any city, and based on reality."
1917,I think this is the best acting performance i have ever witnessed. I am in awe
1918,"Joker is easily one of the best movies I've ever watched in my entire life.Phoenix's performance is beast, not to mention the music, the story, the emotional impact.It questions us as a society. Nobody cared about Arthur and we felt bad about it, would we have cared about Arthur? Do we care about the Arthurs out there?
Arthur became the Joker because somehow the society he lived in led him down that path, and we as a society and the way the system works do the exact same with millions of people.It made me question even myself and my ethics.Wonderful!"
1919,One of the best movie ever made. Amazing performance by Phoenix. Deserves all the oscars
1920,"To put it plainly, this feels like a masterpiece but it isn't really yet still it moves like one. To have a movie about a character in a comic book world portray a message so important in the real world and almost necessary makes this somewhat A- yet masterfully directed and acted movie a masterpiece. 10 out of 10 for me and I will dare again and call it a masterpiece. Its view may scar you but more so it will make you wonder how much possible it is."
1921,Incredible performance by Joaquin Phoenix.Real life type of movie.
1922,"A bang for your buck film that keeps playing in your head for days after. The perfect balance between gripping narrative, mesmorising performances, and high end artistic production. It is simply a 'must see'."
1923,"This movie is all about Phoenix incredible acting. Give him the oscar right away,"
1924,"I was never a fan of typical Super Hero movies based on comic books. This movie however, is not your typical ""Super Hero"" movie. It's dark, real and chilling to the bone. It's crazy how far Joaquin Phoenix went to perform his role. The cinematography, character development, camera work, the mood and feelings you experience are just breathtaking."
1925,200/100 for this film. What a Great actor Joaquin Phoenix and also an awareness to our society to take mental health seriously and debate about the real cause of all Evil in this social. 100% oscar deserving
1926,"Right, this is not really a super hero/villain film. It's a view into a disturbed mind that is superbly acted and just portrayed with such conviction. Did I want a super villain film, well kind of, yes. I was waiting for ""The Joker"" to arrive and cause mayhem. Will this lead to an actual Joker film who takes his inspiration from Arthur and goes by his name and creates mayhem in Gotham, I would not bet against it. I digress, sorry, Joker is a film that keeps the viewer enthrawled and unable to leave the sofa. Totally absorbing and in its own way, very entertaining. A must watch and in all honesty, worth the hype."
1927,"This film is absolutely amazing. Joaquin Pheonix' acting completely blew me away! I love the different take on the typical Joker story, I also feel it has a more creepy vibe to it. I can see why so many people raved about this film."
1928,Joaquin phoenix is legendary. Director beautifully plotted what depression is like which is a WIN WIN.
1929,"I am reminded of Michael Douglas in Falling Down and Bronson's vigilante, but with hope that Phoenix can recover from the role. He has hit it hard, and showed excellence in his work, as always. I wonder where he goes from here, and where does the Batman go from this launch-pad? I can say that it was well-made, and that Crazy was represented, but I was not entertained any more than Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman. A destructive force does not make for a hero, and a bad guy needs a hero."
1930,"I can't even say a word! This movie was phenomenal!I don't know how else to describe it! Best thing I've seen in years! People who say that this movie sucks, obviously they have noooooooo clue!"
1931,"I'm blown away by Joaquin Phoenix's performance. He totally inhabits the persona . I couldn't tear my eyes away. Mesmerising.
That dance on the steps surely must go down as one of the most iconic scenes ever and using Gary Glitters music subversive.
The movie is absorbing and disturbing. The violence makes an impact would being too gory. You could read a lot of symbolism into the the movie. A parable of our times? I just let it wash over and immerse me.
Highly recommended!"
1932,Great movie about mental illness and ones ability to justify evil but this is not the joker. This is not the supervillian that outwits Batman. This guy wouldn't last two seconds against Batman.
1933,Joaquin Phoenix just became the greatest actor of all time. Mind blowing acting.
1934,If you liked Taxi Driver then you'll love this. Phoenix is incredible! So much to the extent that you get that anxious uncomfortable feeling watching it.
1935,"Must watch to understand human psyche. How director show the character in natural way.
Cinematography is superb"
1936,"As we leave the old decade behind, it is worth noting that Joker paves the way for a slew of upcoming superhero adventure flicks in what is sure to be recounted as a thrilling, chillingly plausible tale for DC Comics' most celebrated supervillain. May Todd Phillps' efforts be remembered by us all as a shining example of comic book cinema at its finest!"
1937,"Any film that can keep you riveted to the seat and make you feel sympathy for the ""villain"" is a good one.Phoenix's portrayal of a man struggling and faiming to deal with mental health issues is scarily realistic. His descent into insanity worsened by an uncaring society.There are no heroes in this film, just a glimpse of how little it takes to push someone to the edge."
1938,"First off Joaquin Phoenix was amazing as playing the joker and is the second most best joker ever and the story is incredibly well made with great story and great acting the story is also solid with that amazing performance and relate characters
overall this a very well made story about society and one mans realistic downward spiral into madness which turns him into the joker"
1939,"Finally Legendary Joaquin receiving long coming love and respect to him portraying a legendary character.I have always been a super fan of Joaquin Phoenix and always thought he is a brilliant actor and was counting down the minutes to see his next piece. For me he has proved his genius in making of I'm still here along side Casey Affleck and since Gladiator he has put himself among best of the best actors. of course i nearly had a heart attack when i found out he will portray my favorite villain of all time from my favorite franchise. what a film!Thanks to another Legend, portraying Joker, and with such directing, writing, cinematography and casting, ""Joker"" will go down in history as an absolute masterpiece."
1940,"I've watched 'Joker' twice, and, I must say: this movie is an all-time masterpiece. This film is a brilliant character study of the timeless villain 'Joker.' Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Joker is incredible, and indeed is one of the greatest acting jobs I've ever seen.'Joker' is a film that leaves you with something to chew on: Should you love the Joker, and feel bad for him? Does ignoring mental health have real-life implications on individuals suffering from mental health, physical health; and coming from poor backgrounds?Most films made today do not work your mind in the way 'Joker' does.In my opinion, this film may/should change the way we make superhero and supervillain movies.'Joker' simply astonishes - and captivates audiences, as it'll leave you with your jaw stuck to the floor."
1941,"This movie.... this movie is beyond amazing! Finally seeing the origin story for the Joker makes it so much easier to understand him and why he does what he does. The emotion in the acting, the dancing, the story with his mother. It's a movie I could watch over and over again. I felt bad for the Joker, scared of the Joker, and proud of him all at once. This was definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a while. I might even watch it again this morning."
1942,"Joaquin Phoenix put's on a masterpiece performance, his portrayal of a decent into madness is breathtaking, you feel sympathy for him despite his crime's, the best film I have seen all year."
1943,"Great storyline, and great acting. There should be multiple awards for acting, directing, cinematography, etc. perfectly done! Feel almost bad for the joker :-)"
1944,"Joaquin Phoenix delivers the Oscar worthy performance of a man who succumbs to madness after being dealt a bad hand in life. This movie shows that mental health is both crippling and incredibly powerful to a man who embraces madness as a coping mechanism.Joker saddens, shocks, and enthrals you. It incites thought and discussion. It truly is a must-see movie. WOW!!"
1945,In this movie you get to see a side I've never seen of the joker. It builds sympathy for a character I would of never had. I feel sorry for him and what he goes through.
1946,"You have to see this film to believe it. It's a masterpiece. More so in a world where comicbook-blockbusters and cash crabs rule Hollywood. Todd Philipps and Joaquin Phoenix did what nobody in their wildest dream could imagine: to make one of the most profitable movies with a small kind of art-house film in the DC-Batman-universe. Thanks to Philipps and Phoenix, a great many young people watched for the first time an honest movie which was made with a very special vision and told almost perfectly the story about a man struggling with life and how society interacts with him. The soundtrack alone is worth the admission. But the performance of Phoenix is out of this world. After I saw the soulless, brainless Star Wars 9 episode, I wonder when will the audience break away from movies which scripts are written from marketing and merchandising hacks. It seems there is a strong need for a box-office uprising."
1947,"I've seen the film twice already and plan to see it many more times once it gets released to the public. A dark, but beautiful story with Joaquin Phoenix killing it, as the clown Prince of Gotham."
1948,"Incredibly presented the Joker.
Highly recommended."
1949,Everything about this film is AMZZZZZING! I can't say how effected I was by this such a beautiful film. Love love love it!
1950,"Love the acting, love the soundtrack
The movie is screened well"
1951,"This Movie Can Only be well understood by People who Suffer from Mental Disorders and Insecurities. I personally have Ocd and I was really Touched by the Scene Where Joaquin Phoenix told the therapist ""All I have are Negative thoughts.""I can Virtuall Summarize my whole life to that One sentence Joaquin Phoenix Said. He was so Brief and to the Point. He Ommitted nothing. He is Indeed a Living Legend."
1952,"Everything in this movie is highly artistic. If there will be a talk in future, that which movies were excelled in terms of artistical excellence? Then ,Joker will be ranked one of the top. The performance of Phoenix itself is the incredible thing of the movie. Just observe his body language, dialogues, expressions and mostly his over all merits as a craftsman in acting, you will be stunned. He should get an Oscar for this amazing portrayal though it may have been get a tough competition from Pattinson. Just a thought.
DC has made it clear that it's going to rule the cinematic world from now on."
1953,"This movie is a masterpiece
In acting basically everything and it will be remembered for years to come give joaquin the Oscar ASAP"
1954,"2 hours of watching a seemingly (at the outset) normal person with a job, home, loving mother, maybe a bit of an unusual medical condition, slowly descend into complete madness and destruction.Great visuals, well shot, I am old and not easily disturbed and I found the portrayal of psychosis so completely believable it scared the hell out of me. Masterpiece."
1955,"If someone goes into the Joker movie thinking they are getting a Marvel style comic book movie they will be bored, confused and probably not like it much. To me this is much more a study of severe mental illness and the character development of a person on the fringe with delusions of grandeur and psychotic episodes. To me Joker is what happens when Taxi Driver takes place in a DC world.I would recommend watching this movie like you would Fight Club, Memento or Inception. Be open to the story within the story, try to figure out the true story arc.I went into the movie believing I would see a classic linear, but adult narrative, about an arch villain origin story. But this movie is much much more. I began to realize Joker was an untrustworthy narrator (though done in more of a third person) in the scene with Murray taking a shine to Arthur.Later the scene with Sophie where she doesn't know Arthur drove it home. A big AHA moment. I began to understand the nature of this movie.From then on, I was trying to figure out what really happened and what didn't. It was hard to unravel and kept me guessing. This is exactly what kept the movie interesting and is at it heart what the Joker is.This movie nailed what it is like trying to have a relationship with someone who has delusions, hallucinations or psychotic episodes. One never knows what is real, what is imagined and what is partially real and partially embellished. Unfortunately I know all too well from my personal life where two very close family members suffer from delusions and psychotic episodes.You can't put a rational lens on an irrational mind and expect clarity. Sometimes I think that rational people expect severely mentally ill people to have an a ha moment, to self reflect, to examine their irrational thoughts, or to realize they are having these episodes and have that inner rational mind that let's them know this isn't real. To someone suffering from these conditions, the psychotic episode/delusion/hallucination is realty, and those moments of clarity rarely if ever occur. When they do it is a huge breakthrough often brought on by intense therapy.The result is a confusing mash of episodes, blurred reality and moments of random clarity. It is chaos. I think this movie does an admirable job of trying to mesh these conditions with keeping within the confines of a DC world ethos.The Joker character is living in this world of psychotic chaos, and can not easily be explained in a linear or rational way. The Joker's origin is as confusing and chaotic after the movie as it was before the movie, as it should be.More than any statement about society, this movie is a statement of how misunderstood the people suffering from severe mental illnesses are. As the viewer we have an invitation into this most intimate world, told by the Joker. It uncomfortably nails down how awkward and confusing it is to have a personal or professional relationship with a deeply mentally ill person. Viewers of the Joker get a 2 hour taste of that very experience. There are mixes of sympathy and anger toward Arthur, and you never quite know what is real and what is not.To me this is high cinema wrapped in a DC world, and I hope it opens up a societal discussion on understanding mental illness. Early in the movie Arthur asks for more medications and the Psychiatrist he is seeing says he is on a dozen or so pills. It is a direct jab at the mental health profession that closed down mental health resources and opened the prescription pad in the 90's. You can't medicate someone out of the worst mental illnesses.IMO this movie will age very well, and more discussion will come out of it."
1956,"I feel that no amount of words would suffice to describe such an amazing movie! The cinematography,acting,sound design and how it's directed is incredible. I would say that this movie deserves an Oscar."
1957,"Wow..........
What was that last night, I finally watched Joker.And what was that!
The movie was in my eyes fantastic.
Acting/cinematography/writing/soundtrack
I can only describe this movie in one word ""amazing"". So, let's talk about the acting of Joaquin Phoenix.
I have never see someone blend in his role like he did.
Like when he first killed those 3 guys in the subway, he had in that scene so much anger but also sadness.
It really looked like Phoenix was for real angry and sad.
And all of the other scene's, I just got the chills.
So like everyone say, he really deserve an Oscar.And then a big applause for Todd Phillips, how he write and direct this movie.
There was no second I thought when is this movie done.
The only sort of negative thing was, that the first half came up really slow.
But the second half made it good.My favorite thing about the whole movie was that sort of amusing part.
The music, the little jokes and his sentence; First I thought my life was a tragedy but actually it's a comedy.So here a summary,
Joker is a amazing movie, I am 100% sure that it is the best Dc movie that is ever made.
Acting/cinematography/writing/soundtrack are awesome.
And Joaquin Phoenix is a great actor ( btw this is the first movie that I saw with him).
And I enjoyed it so much."
1958,"Wow! The most honestly portrayed movie version of how stigmatized mental health has been and still is in present day. Reality of government loosing funding, receiving no medications, to experiencing major trauma in a human beings life, society taking the side of the suffering of this real life based movie. Phoenix was magnificent and deserves a Grammy if not two! I will be buying this and using it in my group therapy sessions! Best movie 2019."
1959,"No joke this is by far the best movie that I've ever watch in my entire life and surpassing the magnificent movie 'Seven' (1995). At first I felt bad for the protagonist Arthur Fleck but when he starting to change into becoming the Joker I felt terrified of him which is amazing that the movie accomplished that. This movie is also not for everyone because of the lack of action and always annoys me when people saying this movie is bad with the reason of ""This movie is boring"". I really recommend you who likes a good story but I do not recommend this to the people who just want action like every Marvel movie."
1960,"The film never disappoints, not one bit. Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck/Joker is brilliant as hell, he lets his acting ooze out from his eyes and his body. The film is not about Joker and his violence and neither the director (Todd Philips) or the screenwriters (Todd and co-writer Scott Silver) have tried showing it that way; It istead focuses on Arthur's descent into madness, driven by his experience of society and how he finds his solace in the chaos that was indirectly started by his actions.
A must watch for every cinephile(thanks to cinematography by Lawrence Sher) and a treat to watch. Send in the clowns- the best of 2019 is here ! And also, the 2nd best of the decade (only behind Inception)."
1961,"You get Arthur flick played brilliantly by Phoenix his performance in this film is outstanding much better than any interpretation of this character I honestly cant go back and read any comics or watch any movies because this character is better written than all of them combined this movie doesn't have a supervillian who's going to destroy the city with a bomb none of that crap here we get to see joker the human being a man who has clearly been suffering all his life in the comic they would say it would take one bad day to drive a man insane that's not the case here this man had been suffering for years and finally he cracked one of the best scenes is him watching the tv and he imagines himself at the Murray franklin show he gets single out for his laugh and is accepted and hugged by his idol Murray that was brillant because i don't care who you are we as human beings want to be accepted for who we are and loved unconditionally but that's the problem Arthur never got any of that love he gets treated like sh! by nearly every one in this film the only person who treated him like a human being was the dwarf and Arthur let him live which I thougt was brilliant it added layers of depth to this character the joker in the comics would of killed the dwarf this one didn't which is fascinating to me he only kills people who have directly wronged him like his mother who is a horrible person we find out why Arthur is the way he is because she allowed him to abused and he smother her and says I always thought my life was a tragedy but its a comedy because nothing he does matters his life is a joke by this point in the film hes got nothing to lose when he kills Randall another awful human being who most likely had a hand in getting him fired from his job he embraces his madness and dances down the steps hes liberated finally free to do as he pleases no medication nothing than he goes on the Murray show and I never noticed this detail the 1st time watching it the original joke was knock knock than he proceeded to kill himself live in front of the world to show society this is what you have made me but Murray didnt stfu he kept pushing him the brilliant dialogue and acting in this scene is off the charts quotes like ""if it was me dying on the sidewalk youd walk right by me I pass you every day and you dont notice me"" which is true go in any major city see people walk right by homeless on the streets dying nobody cares people are apathetic but then he proceeds to tell Murray youre awful playing my video you just wanted to make fun of me if you look at Arthur in the hospital scene with his mother when Murray played his tape you can see the pain in his face Murray was his idol and he threw him under the bus so he decides to give Murray one last joke what do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash I'll tell you what you get you get what you deserve and he blows Murray brains out on live tv and sits there for a moment and laughs because his life is a joke the way the scene played out with the brilliant score you knew it was coming the tension was boiling over and Arthur allows the police to capture him Gotham is full of riots rightfully so the waynes get gunned down as a result of his actions and honestly I don't feel any empathy for the waynes theyre awful people Thomas in particular calling every poor person who has suffered clowns and he says he wants to run for mayor to improve peoples lives yet Arthurs medicial programs are all cut he loses his medicine is forced to go cold turkey if Thomas Wayne actually cared he could of funded a new program but he didnt becuase he didnt care this performance of the Wayne's is the most realistic portrayal of these characters and thr film ends with a what if scenario what really happend was he in the Aslyum all this time it doesn't matter ultimately because the point of the film is society has a role to play in creating these monsters as does the media for publishing their photos and making them stars I hope at least Phoenix gets nominated because if front the Oscars are bs his performance as Arthur fleck had me thinking about this movie for a week it truly is thought provoking and better than any comic book film to come out in 20 years"
1962,Joaquin was amazing. The whole movie is a masterpiece. Looking forward for the next chapters. Can't wait
1963,"I'm not a big fan of comic books, as the matter of fact I never read one and I usually don't care about movies based on them, Batman, Spiderman, Captain America, Marvel, DC, whatever... I'm a sucker for psychology movies and that's why I watched this one. And oh boy was it a good decision! If you're expecting your typical comic book-y Joker vs Batman, good vs evil kind of thing you will be disappointed. This is a study of REAL human madness, it's a critic of modern society, it's as real as it gets. Joker is a flawless movie, by far the greatest masterpiece of 21st century, and I am expecting at least one Oscar. And if it gets a sequel as good as this, that sequel deserves Oscar too. I've already seen it twice and I think I didn't have enough of it so I'll watch again"
1964,"Best movie I've ever seen! Everything is phenomenal, story adaptation, acting, cinematography, and more. It's an emotional thrill ride that takes you through a deeper look and mental health and our society."
1965,"This is one of, if not the greatest interpretation I have ever seen. Everything about this movie screams OSCAR... I simply loved it."
1966,"So I grew up being a huge Batman fan, Naturally when I heard they were making a Joker film I was really excited. Went into this movie very excited and I was very let down. Honastly I thought the movie was boring, But it did have a few epic moments but overall it was just an ok movie"
1967,"Amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix.
Excellent story.
I truly enjoyed the film."
1968,"Why there are only 10 stars for this movie?
I need 11th star to vote, only for this movie.."
1969,"Joaquin Phoenix absolutely killed the movie (no pun intended) with his fantastic performance as Joker. The movie was beautiful and was smartly shot, if you're a person who notices small details like me, you'll be amazed by the details that were presented, like the colour scale in each scene as there was a specific pattern in that. The build-up in the background music also hinted how the character was developing until it reached the ""max level"" let us say. Even the scenes that were supposedly real, but turn out to be only a hallucination inside the mind of Arthur (Joker).
Moreover, despite what some people didn't like this movie just because it was too violent and showed that it was praising the evil and violence, while the real message is actual and should be taken seriously as we witness it from time to time, especially in school mass shootings. People don't end up killing the other all of a sudden, it is all built up from continuous bullying and getting abused, and when those people seek for help in mental health services lets say, they should really help them not just listening to them, asking the same questions over and over then give them medication which can get them addicted at some point."
1970,The people that hate the movie r the real joker .They may hate the movie but no one is there to listen to them .1 billion
1971,I really think that this has something for everyone. If you hold a place in the modern society then this movie has a something for you. This movie holds a mirros up to modern society and shows us who we are and what we're capabil of.
1972,"As someone who hates most comic book movies; The trailer sold me on this one and the movie did not disappoint, amazing film."
1973,"This is a truly stunning piece of film. The character development is perfect. I honestly think this could be used in film and media studies as a lesson in exactly how to bring a character to fruition.I do feel it worth saying, this is a true honour to Heath Ledger's Joker. If he hadn't given the performance he did, this film wouldn't have been so interesting. I believe that Heath's portrayal of the Joker gave rise to our need to understand the character's back story more.If Joaquin doesn't win best Oscar I'll be a monkey's uncle! Anyone who can laugh and cry at the same time deserves accolades!"
1974,"Someday the throng of pious ""socially responsible"" critics who tried to destroy this powerful film will come to figure out why Joker is truly the movie of the decade."
1975,"This is not your ordinary great movie. This is legendary cinematography, acting, direction, narration, art direction, costumes, score, from beginning to end. This is perfection serendipity that comes together when all magic is aligned in the universe. Joaquin Phoenix gives a mesmerizing breath-taking performance that may still haunt you after you leave the theater. His acting is totally flawless in every second of his presence, you are drawn to his character, relating to his world, falling for him, his villain yet deeply angelic psyche. As a character he is unmatched, as an actor he just redefined acting."
1976,"Wawooooooooo!
Not an easy one, but, again, wawooooooooo!!!A true masterpiece on all parameters:Acting, story, directing, music.A very strong and troubling spiritual and social message too...So for the last time - wawooooooooo!"
1977,"Joker is a deliciously great movie. Despite the unjustified criticism, this film is undoubtedly an audiovisual jewel, from photography (accompanied by an exciting soundtrack) to the impeccable performance of Joaquin Phoenix. The best of the year."
1978,It's amazing movie .. the actor should be win Oscars ..
1979,If the actor joaquin don't win an oscar i will stop considerate this ceremony a worthy price
1980,"Right from the start you notice the brilliance of the cinematography. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is masterful! Worthy of an Oscar nomination no questions about it. The score is thrilling and gives you chills at times. A dark, disturbing and trembling experience in all of the best ways possible. This film is a masterpiece! It works as it's own original origin story with tiny little Easter eggs from the comics for fans to recognize."
1981,You shouldn't expect a superhero movie. It's more of a character study. Great acting performance and a very dense atmosphere.In between I forgot that I still hold popcorn in my hand. A really outstanding film.
1982,"I think in this film, the director wanted to show us the current political scene, very subtle. The director demonstrates how from a clown you become the great boss. In the case of Donald Trump, this character may be, if we analyze the film from a political point of view, very discreetly combined politics and art.
Yes the actor had a flawless performance."
1983,"This is a mature and complex psychological thriller disguised as a comic book movie. Joaquin Phoenix, one the greatest actors working today gives one of the best performances of his entire career. He once again proves his incredible range as an actor. He had big shoes to fill and he absolutely delivered. Todd Philips proves his versatility as a director, since this is a genre that he didn't have much experience with before.It tackles some very relevant themes such as class divisions, loneliness, poverty and mental illness and all these themes were incorporated very well without being too on the nose. The incorporation of the Wayne family was also done very well, eventhough some people had issues with this aspect. The background score and cinematography were amazing and really helped to elevate certain scenes.A lot of people had criticized the numerous similarities to taxi driver and the king of comedy. I am personally okay with some of these, since this was openly stated by the filmmakers and were intended to be homages. However at times the similarities are too obvious and it almost feels like a remake of taxi driver. I was hoping that the homages should've been presented in slightly more subtle manner so that the movie didn't have to lean so heavily on taxi driver"
1984,"First let me start by saying that this film is absolutely award season material. The tone, music, story and jaw dropping performance by Phoenix should be seen by anyone who is a fan of film.
Having said that, this is one of the darkest films I have ever seen. There is little to grab onto for anyone who is an optimist or likes neat happy stories. It's a difficult watch, that for the excellent story and performance by Joakim Phoenix would have many not lasting until the final credits. I'm so glad I saw this movie, would certainly recommend this movie but i felt upon leaving the theater that I needed to wash my brain and would not view it again for a good long while."
1985,"The entire movie is well done, entirely plausible for someone struggling with mental illness to spiral out of control given the circumstances. Just be warned that it's a tough slog through two hours that will leave you questioning society and maybe even your very own self."
1986,"Before you go to watch the movie you think it's gonna be overhyped, but no it lives up to all expectations! Firstly the acting is amazing amazing Mr. Phoenix may just get shortlisted for the Oscar IMO! The plot packs a punch at every twist and every turn, for me there was never ever a dull moment. I'm not going to go into much detail you have to see it to believe it an absolute masterpiece! THATS LIFE."
1987,"I'll be honest , I didn't think Joaquin Phoenix was going to be right for the role, I kept thinking of his role in Signs and Gladiator when I first heard that he would be playing the joker several months ago. DC having changed direction with its movies and flavour , the joker Heath Ledger played was a new level of amazing that probably wouldn't have ever been matched but I think that dark and chaotic feel really came out with this movie, It made you really empathise for the joker .it felt very real and it showed how Gotham created the joker .Great movie , best I've watched all year."
1988,"There isn't much else to say; Joker is one of the most absorbing, powerful films ever made. The cinematography is remarkable and the score is just perfectly potent and understated. This is not a thrill-a-minute movie designed to keep you entertained throughout. It is a heavy, all-consuming character study that invites you, with reluctance and fascination, into the mind of a severely disturbed outcast. I don't remember any movie leaving me feeling so emotionally disoriented as I left the cinema.The performance by Joaquin Phoenix is something very special indeed. We spend nearly the full two hours just watching him close up and every second is exhilarating. Rarely, if ever, has a character been so utterly captivating, so desperate and so tragic. His physical acting, from writhing in anguish to dancing with warped delight, is utterly mesmerising. And not once did he ever lay it on too thick. To portray that level of pain and fury without indulging in excess morbidity or melodrama is quite an achievement.Forget where this masterpiece fits into the world of DC comics and Batman movies; Joker is a stand-alone film that deservedly takes its place amongst the greats."
1989,"I can't imagine this Joker fight with a superhero. Like a DC or a Marvel movies nowdays
But have to continue this masterpiece."
1990,"I was just speechless after watching Joker in the cinema.This movie is a pure masterpiece with an oscarworthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix. His laugh, his antics... everything... was perfect.One of the best movies i ever saw."
1991,"Joker's like getting in a time machine and going back to 1983 and watching a movie that was made without modern restraints to be thought provoking & entertaining, definitely NOT made to be PC, LGBT or appeal specifically to the Chinese or any minority. Joker was made for all mankind. The bought and paid for mainstream media critics will hate Joker, but true film fans will leave having seen something unapologetically original and unimaginably enjoyable. Joker resembles Taxi Driver or Platoon for getting in your head with brutal honesty and never leaving."
1992,"I have to fan geek out on this FILM! It is simply one of the most perfect efforts in cinema ever. If JOKER does not rake in awards or more specifically multiple Oscars I will be befuddled! Joaquin Phoenix always delivers a masterful performance in all of his movies however this performance is truly magnificent. I was spellbound by him and by so much more. This music is phenomenal and high praises to Hildur Guðnadóttir!!!!! I will be seeking this brilliant composer to listen more of. Lawrence Shers' cinematography was beautiful and the film color/saturation was so spot on!!! KUDOS! Editing? Beautifully done!!!! Thanks to Jeff Groth and his team if he has one! I could keep singing about this movie but I will spare everyone....but damn, the man who brought it all together, director Todd Phillips. Masterful job!!!!! I wanted to stand up and cheer during the credits.... :) LOVED IT!"
1993,"It was refreshing watching ""Joker"" in the theater (AMC Raceway, Westbury, NY). It was really nice watching a movie that took a new approach to (somewhat) familiar material. It was nice seeing a movie that challenges the audience. For the most part, ""Joker"" succeeds in what it was trying to do. Writer/ director Todd Phillips and company deserve a lot of credit. The best thing about this movie is its look. It really feels like that time and place. The problem that I had with ""Joker"" is that it seemed to wear out its welcome after a while. Joaquin Phoenix gives a good performance. But if I was supposed to somehow sympathize with his character's plight, I didn't. I didn't really care about him or any of the other characters for that matter. When you watch a movie and don't really care about the people you're watching you can start to lose interest. I didn't look at my watch during ""Joker"" but I was tempted. Dishonorable mention: a miscast Robert De Niro."
1994,"Such a sad movie with a consuming psychological depth. a dark portrayal of a character with an iconic and sorrowful laugh, who slowly collapses under the pressuring circumstances. great soundtracks and beautiful acting.
it seems to be an everyday tragic but it still touches you in a new and different way of raw & haunting reality. the best part: another interpretation of the joker. his disoriented and ""unintentionally"" actions are full of desperation, (always had a weak spot whenever I saw people hurting inside, and he definitely hit that). it really feels like the beginning of all - of how arthur becomes the joker."
1995,"Well done Joaquin Phoenix as a perfect joker,and i want to see deleted 30 min, I think it has how many great senses we lost . The Best movie in 2019 i ever watched"
1996,Please go and see the movie! Its a masterpiece! Avoid the stupid critics. I think they have created the best dark version of comics antagonist with this film. Oscars to whole team of Joker!
1997,"I will only be saying what everyone else is. Joaquin Phoenix is off the charts amazing. If he doesn't win just about every award there is for movies then there should be no more awards.
Rarely do I ever come out of a movie saying "" I just saw a masterpiece of a movie"" maybe a few times in my life. This was a masterpiece of filmmaking and acting."
1998,"Im sorry to all who didn't like this movie, but this movie is one of the best movies i've seen in my life.
My mouth was wide open the whole movie. Everything was perfect, the sound, the art, the storyline. Just give this man an oscar"
1999,"Although everyone's entitled to their own opinion and that's totally understandable and everything but to the people who are bashing this masterpiece by saying it is showing ""irresponsible violence"", it ""mocks mental illness"" and all that, I'll just say read or know about comics first and then watch this movie, go home, think, and watch it again just to appreciate the sheer brilliance that this movie portrays in terms of acting, direction, cinematography, the background score and what not!
I'm not saying that everyone has to read comics before watching this movie I'm just suggesting that before bashing this piece of art, know about the character, it's story arc what it stands for, it's history and all that. If the issue still pertains? Maybe it is wrong but give it a try."
2000,"Short review straight to the point.Joaquin Phoenix 11/10

Writing 11/10

Exitement 11/10

2001,"The film starts off slow but straight off the bat, compelling, interesting look into the life of Arthur Fleck, Joker. It is unclear whether or not this is the Infamous Joker aka Batman's nemesis. Without trying to spoil anything, it is unclear whether or not some parts of this origin are true or not, and this is because of an unreliable narrator/main character. This is what makes this movie stand out just as plenty of other stories do as well. The ability to give the audience/reader a chance to analyze the material and theorize themselves what it is that is being discussed or viewed. It was honestly an amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix. It was reminiscent of Ledger's haunting performance that was truly one of a kind. And so is Joaquin's. It was a psychological masterpiece of not only the development of a character (one of the best like walter white level, and Joker is just a 2 hr movie) but the cinematography that made this mental breakdown come to life. I don't know whats up with the critics, but they definitely got this one wrong.I don't believe this needs a sequel... this is by far the greatest origin story for a mysterious villain arch storyline. And this coming from a Wolverine fan, Logan was great, this was superior... all we need is a Punisher Origin story, in the idea of Platoon. Joker deserves a 9.7."
2002,"Joaquin Phoenix was amazing in this. Oscar probably guaranteed already.However, for me, the overall film itself was just good. Not sure I found it as amazing as others have seen to. I know it was meant to be different and quite dark, but it's maybe a bit too far that way for me.Definitely still worth the watch though."
2003,"This by far is the best film of 2019. Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix take us on a mesmerizing and uncomfortable journey. The score, cinematography, the writing, and acting is flawless. I was hooked from start to finish and the character development that we saw with arthur fleck was on point. Its not an action movie nor really a superhero movie. The only villain we focus on is the joker and we see a bit of thomas waynes life. The hype is real and i couldnt of loved this movie more."
2004,"The positives of this film are undeniable. Phoenix's performance is fantastic and will be looked at for years to come. The rest of the cast is also great, though all in service of Phoenix. The cinematography, pacing, editing, and direction are all some of the beat of the year. But the main problem lies with the script. Every rave review I've read has talked about Joker as a critique of society. And it definitely tries to be, but fails to keep a cohesive message. A lot of the film revolves around Arthur Fleck and his mother's struggle with poverty and dealing with a system controlled by wealthy elitists that don't care about the downtrodden. This is seen through the ending of funding for Arthur's therapy and meditation. Thomas Wayne is used to symbolize this, which was an effective choice. The problem with this message is that it is undercut several times by people contributing to Arthur's problems for reasons other than the system. The film starts with a gang of going kids attacking Arthur and contributing to his eventual firing from work. But the kids have no clear motivation besides being mean, which doesn't connect at all to the idea of a broken system. When Arthur is attacked on the train by the Wayne executives, their acts are out of cruelty and don't really relate to their socioeconomic status. These and a few other instances throughout the movie really beg the question of whether the main theme of the film is about a system that fails to take care of the disadvantaged, or that all people are just mean. This results in a film that acts like it has lots of incredible societal commentary but never goes deep enough into anything to actually say much of anything. To quote NerdSync, ""The screenplay feels like it was written by a committee of edgy teens who totally think they're deep and interesting while never settling on a single, unifying idea or belief. Just 'people suck.'"" So no, don't believe the hype. It's a solid movie that begins to fall apart under closer examination."
2005,"Never written a review before, but felt compelled here due to all the news headlines about people walking out of this movie...
I saw this movie yesterday. It was absolutely awesome. As a movie-goer, I have always preferred the grittier, more realistic movies to typical Hollywood action blockbusters.
I'll start by saying that this movie is not a typical ""DC comics Universe"" movie, it is not a super-hero/super-villain movie, this is a movie for grown-ups; portraying a visceral character-analysis of how the Joker came to be.
Does it score on that front? Totally. Does it glamourise mental health issues? Absolutely not.
Joaquin Phoenix was hands-down, the best actor to have been cast for this role. In my opinion, he is an actor who is only getting better with age. His realistic portrayal of Arthur Fleck descending into Joker was absolutely bang-on. The story was realistic - a ""how it could really have happened if Joker were real"" if you will. A realistic portrayal of how society can be perceived today. Are there violent scenes in this movie? Yes. Have I seen movies that have shown more/worse violence than this movie? God yes. The Purge, Goodfellas, Casino, Battle Royale... I could literally go on and on. People need to remember that this is a movie. People walking out of this movie because of it's violence, portrayal of mental health issues, or because they believe it could ""incite"" gun-violence or mass-shooting issues, already have problems reconciling some of these issues that are real-life in todays world. This movie doesn't exacerbate gun-violence issues, it merely highlights the fact that America has, and has always had, gun control issues. Quite frankly, I'm more disturbed by what I read about the current US government administration than I am about anything I saw in this film. Go see it for yourselves folks. Recommended."
2006,"'Joker' is an excellent character-piece on a man that gets beaten down in his world and changes into a terrifying symbol for others. Joaquin Pheonix's portrayal is unforgettable, carrying the film and making the character feel as real as possible. Though the movie may be slow for some, it is necessary to show all the events that are necessary to transform a character in this manner. The film is a must-watch due to Joaquin's portrayal of this classic character. An excellent performance, stunning cinematography, and stylistic score makes this film great."
2007,"A true masterclass how such a violent and psychotic character can be made seem so relatable , I found myself sympathizing so much with Joaquin Phoenix's character ""Joker"" and that is a true sign of great writing. We find out how horribly abused Arthur Morgan really was and how that caused the birth of the ""Joker"" A must watch!!"
2008,"With a Phenomenal performance from Joaquin Phoenix, and Todd Phillips at his best in the directors chair. ""Joker"" is a realistic yet somber portrayal of mental health and societal rejection, told through a perspective of the greatest comic-book villain ever created. ""Joker"" is a brilliant tour de force with spectacular cinematography and will likely become another great staple in our world of Superhero cinema."
2009,This is absolutely brilliant! Phoenix's performance is unreal. So superb scenes that will be remembered forever. This is a must watch film!!! I highly recommend it.
2010,"Everyone that has ever bullied someone should see this movie just to understand what that behaviour does to people. Not everyone act like Joker but it sure hurts and breaks you inside. Beautiful beautiful movie, 10/10"
2011,"I've never written a review on here before, but Joaquin Phoenix's performance in this movie floored me. By the end, I was simply in awe! If he doesn't win the Academy Award for Best Actor, I'll never watch the Oscars ever again."
2012,"Movie was getting knocked in press as a stimulus for violence. Got knocked by some radio claims of gloominess and depressive. Got knocked by political circles for using a backdrop of over-powerful rich class rule over fading lower classes.
You know what, Michael Moore tells it like it is when it comes to the attempt by the above to misdirect the ""GREATNESS"" of this film.
My wife and I found it an awesome production, director effort and actor excellence.
Brings the Joker to humaness, and sets up the character to be exploited in the Batman Saga's."
2013,"A masterpiece, the best in 2019 and one of the best I've ever seen. Phoenix did his best and more, and he WILL get that Oscar once and for all. Arthur's character is sad and miserable, got nothing from life expect more sadness, he is maybe mad but in the and, when he says that to Murray is true and fair, some of us still have that life some of us had that life, and we all understand what suffers Arthur. He is a villain but he is also a hero in a way"
2014,"The best live action joker by far, the plot is designed form him to shine and Joaquin gives proves that he is probably the best actor alive."
2015,First of all. It's such a well constructed world. Closer to reality than any other Gotham I've seen but just skewed enough to be different.It's harsh and brutal but also lays society/humanity bare.I'm not a Batman movie fan in general and I felt this was something different. Definitely worth a watch!
2016,"Nothing to say just a fkn MASTERPIECE😍
The acting, story, characters it is just all perfect"
2017,"Now I'm not gonna say that Joker was a psychological masterpiece and that it showcased the true art of cinema or some crap like that. For me Joker was great because it was different, it took its time to make you understand the character of Arthur Fleck and unravel the plot, had interesting things to say about society and wasn't pandering to the audience and it made me smile.First off to get it out of the way let me address the so called ""controversy"" of this film in my opinion. To me for the most part I never really saw any controversy, I knew going in that Joker was a villain and I expected the movie to show me the violent acts of the Joker character and yes some of the violence is brutal but was never glorified or overblown like in some R-rated movies(lookin at you Hellboy, no cap)Sure most of the movie was leaning towards making you feel sympathy towards Arthur Fleck even though he did violent and terrible things but the movie made it known that Joker was a villain and had mental health issues that makes him the way he is, along with the tragic events that happen throughout his life but the purpose of the movie was to show you how someone can go from being a normal person and be broken by life and turn into a psychopath, and the volience and themes show that.Okay now let's move on to the performances, I'm sure you've heard it somewhere and I'm gonna say it again Joaquin Phoenix was dope playing the role of Arthur Fleck/Joker. I usually don't care for the oscars but I would like this man to win one. Joaquin made me feel sympathy for Arthur throughout the movie and potrayed Arthur's mental health issues perfectly and when he turned into the Joker...I enjoyed his performance man. Robert Deniro as Murray Franklin (a talk show host) was good, Frances Conroy as Penny Fleck (Arthur's mother) also gave a convincing performance as well. Brett Cullen as Thomas Wayne was also interesting as the movie gave a very different version of Thomas Wayne from other Batman related movies. The character of Thomas Wayne was almost cruel and colder than any other versions from the comic or movies and I appreciated that a lot especially interactions between him and Arthur Fleck.Zazie Beetz as Sophie was meh I mean she didn't give a bad performance by any means it's just that she was used for a certain plot point and twist that I saw coming from a mile away and I felt that her arc or character even was unneeded and her contribution to Arthur's story would have been fine without her character.One thing I was worried about was that people in the movie were going to be unrealistically cruel to Arthur, however that wasn't the case the movie handled that part pretty well and again I appreciated that. The story of Arthur becoming Joker took its time and didn't rush his transformation, the movie really made you understand Arthur's life, his dreams, mental state, relationships with certain people and his interactions before everything turns upside down and starts doing Joker ish. Arthur's downfall was heartbreaking to watch and you felt the consequences of being cruel to other people but also some effects of mental health issues.However although I really liked that the movie took its time with the story and was really patient....I don't really like the slow burn feel to this movie , its just not my cup of tea and it's not that i require an action sequence every 15 minutes it's just that some movies take unnecessary time and energy trying to deepen the story or character motivations and the pace of the movie can become very slow and drag on. Joker was never 100% boring to me but there were times that the movie almost became a drag to watch.The third act alone is a solid 10/10 you not only get to see the Joker character in full force but the themes that the movie was trying to convey come full circle, it became brutal, almost heartbreaking, tense and wild. Especially with its themes about people being unnecessarily cruel to one another, not considering other people around you (not loving your neighbor so to speak). The key theme about how someone can turn evil after a series of bad things happening to someone, being an outcast in society basically how the world can be a cruel place and how some people will break under that pressure (I could go on all day).Also what I really really liked that the movie never preaches to you or panders to the audience about these themes but mostly uses the show don't tell method almost the entire movie except very few instances whereby the movie tells you it's themes through characters but not in a bad way. Without saying too much my favorite scene of the movie was the interaction between Joker and De Niro's character Murray whereby the movie really shines.The movie had a dark tone to it and worked really well, the movie wasn't bleak or dark for the sake of being dark and there were some funny moments, not a lot since it was a very serious but had funny moments mostly dark humor I mean it's a Joker movie so there are gonna be laughs. Speaking of laughs the movie did a really interesting thing with Arthur's/Joker's laugh so well done movie. A few nitpicks are that you don't get to see the Joker character for long until the last act of the movie I get it's an origin story but I wished there could have been a little more Joker scenes but it's not a negative point but a wish really. Not many characters were really as interesting as Arthur Fleck or Murray and maybe Penny Fleck. The movie never really reveals that Joker's violent actions are justified or right but it made you understand why someone would do the things he did even if it's not right.Joker was great, one of the best movies of 2019, one of the best DC and comic book movies of all time. There was a cool tie-in to Batman, had funny some scenes The Arthur Fleck character was amazing, the story was well written,when Arthur became Joker it was really awesome. The movie had really great themes but the movie is slow at times and had some uninteresting characters but what really matters is Joker put a smile on my face."
2018,Not the movie of the year but the movie of the century
2019,"I came into this movie with the highest scepticism. Partly because Heath Ledger's Joker was my favourite movie character of all time and i coulnd't see how somebody would come close to it. But Joaquin did, BIG TIME. Because you see, Dark Knigh'ts Joker was a badass dude, crazy at times, but this, this was something else. I saw people come in with kids, i also read people are hating on it for being too violent and triggering. WHAT DID YOU EXPECT? This movie is about Joker, the prince of darkness, the craziest of them all. I had been waiting for a movie like this in years!!! Thank you Joaquin Phoenix!!! Thank you Todd Phillips!!!"
2020,"Joker. Can two actors win Oscar's for playing the same character? Hell. Yes. Joaquin Phoenix acts his arse off in this stunning cinematic tour de force. His portrayal of a man's descent into madness and violence truly equals, if not surpasses, Robert De Nero's Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver. This is hands down the best film Troy has seen this year. The recreation of '70s New York (Gotham City) was first rate, as was the score. Stunning. Five stars."
2021,"What a great movie. Joaquin Phoenix performance was beautiful. The greatest villain in history deserved this performance. It's so sad, but it is a movie that occurs in the 70s with today's society. The photography was great, but a lot of close ups."
2022,"Reality might be even darker. Gotham people get their joker. But we vote got our president, who is one of Thomas Wayne. All these remind me communism vs capitalism."
2023,"I've never seen a movie with such depiction of life. I truly felt the character, what he was feeling. Outstanding acting by Joaquin, he portrayed the true essence of the character and created an examplary joker.
It's true what they say: All it takes is a one bad day"
2024,"I went to the cinema to see this movie today. What an amazing movie. I'm speechless. It's dark, very dark. The music is beautiful and Joaquin Phoenix is acting fantastic!! Wow! I love this movie so much!"
2025,"I'm still in the theater. Creadits are rolling. Don't want to include any spoilers, but I will definitely come back to watch again and again as long as it's on the big screen. Incredible performance by Phoenix, thought provoking, emotional and moving. Absolute pleasure"
2026,"There is a reason why this masterpiece is being panned by the crony capitalist critics. It challenges their all too comfortable fake construction of reality and it does so in such an effective way, that it almost automatically elicits a bad faith defensive reaction from them, frightened to the bone that their charade might get uncovered. Joker might be delusional, but it is they that sell delusions in order to maintain the status quo.
But, eventually, and they know it, you get what you deserve. That sentence and that sentiment is what so scares them, because this movie cuts too close to the bone, and like all great, game-changing art, it is just a bit too true.
When Joker, who is a true hero here, helps a character, equally mistreated by the powers that be, go free, he points that he was the only one that treated him well. This is a call for kindness that is essence of the movie, but it is barely noticed by those who, like the villain of the movie, Thomas Wayne, think we are all despicable clowns. So they lie and pool wool over our eyes, as they only can, misconstrue and make false scares, so that the point of the movie that is most damaging for them would not get across.All these are marks of a great movie. In Europe, it was instantly recognized - and rewarded, for the subversive potential it has. In North America, it scared the hell out of conformists, and the reaction was, for many, an almost reflexive rejection. Which means it hit, it hit hard, quite uncomfortably so. And if anything the hypocrites hate so much, it is the movie that exposes them, and, even more so, exposes the paper tiger of the blood sucking system they depend on for what it is."
2027,"Best
Joker
Ever!!!
The best movie last 5 years!
10/10"
2028,"I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least. It's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood)"
2029,"A deeply sad and very troubling film. Reminds me a lot of 'The Mechanic' starring Christian Bale, in that the movie is a study of the character rather than the wider story around it.Would liked to have seen more about Joker's effects on wider society rather than spending 90% of the film demonstrating why he is psychotic.The cinematography and acting across the board was almost flawless. Phoenix will undoubtably be a serious contender for best actor this year."
2030,"DC kept on disappointing it's fans by spending a lot on cinematography and animations but this time this will be a real masterpiece. With an amazing cinematic experience, we will see good acting also which makes it one of the most anticipated movies of DC."
2031,"This has to be the darkest movie I've seen in years. Sure it is a story, but it's not entertainment in my opinion. I won't be adding it to my collection when the disc comes out. And I will not recommend it to friends and family. I really don't know how it is making so much money. This is my opinion.
Oh, and the music was hauntingly great. Joaquin and the music kept me to the end."
2032,"Move is slow. It's mainly about mental illness. Not The Joker. And I don't wanna hear Phoenix even holds a candle to Ledgers Joker. It's not close. Ledger is a legend and Phoenix is something to forget. For one, he is a soft, weak, milquetoast man (his character). It is surrounded by darkness but not the kind you like or can enjoy. It's a sad & dreary played out movie that takes too long like someone that speaks a lot but doesn't say much. He isn't the Joker till roughly 20-25 minutes left. To sum it up, he smokes a cigarette, dances in a twirl, gets humiliated and laughs while crying for 3/4 of the movie. Spare me. It wasn't very good and is definitely overhyped. But I'm glad De Niro got his head blown off."
2033,This movie made me want to walk outside and kill everyone ..... anyone who gets in my way from now on I'm just going to think of this movie and kill them all !
2034,"Why everybody keep saying it's a good movie? it's a movie about psycho getting more psycho and nothing more.Good acting? Well if you like crazy laugh 20 times in a movie, then maybe. People keep saying it has a ""deeper meaning"". Really? This is deep??? Uhm... OK. This move sucks, don't bother watching it."
2035,The people who are calling this movie a cinematic masterpiece are the same people who follow the Kardashians on social media.Robert Di Nero is the only good actor in this movie.
2036,"Lots of ppl have given 10 star ... probably Bcz of story line and acting done by the main lead but is this sufficient to make a good movie??I must say that this movie was so so depressing from starting till the end there was not a single happy moment in the movie.Dark, bore, gloomy, despairing movie"
2037,"An astonishing performance by Phoenix, however the film as a whole whilst cleverly done is overrated. Worth a watch, but no need to rush."
2038,"As a big Joker fan who has been waiting for this movie, the whole year. I left the theatre underwhelmed and frankly a bit bored. I really hope I will like it more with a second viewing because I love the Joker as a character. Joaquin Phoenix is unbelivably good as he is in all his movies and the cinematography is breathtaking but I just didn't feel the story. I expect this movie to be divisive once the initial excitement is gone."
2039,"As a comic movie this falls flat on its face. This is no villain.. Just a sad, pathetic loser. If not for the words Gotham and Wayne thrown around a few times, it wouldve nothing to do with the Batman universe at all.. Its a mediocre drama with a well playing Phoenix, but not more. For this it's overly long and dissapointingly missing any interesting content."
2040,"It's not even a good movie, some crazy things that people think that it was artistic or somewhat. Please guys, it's a horrible movie!!!
Worst movie all the time!"
2041,"""If everyone in a room is thinking all the same, someone is not thinking."" George S.Patton. Last night I watched dear Heath run his dance as Joker and wonderment of it all - how damn good he was. So tonight I walked into a brick wall. EVERYONE says magnificent. Better than CITIZEN KANE and such tripe. Me? Bored, after 20 min of just bleak - nothing positive. I am moving right now and that is enough stress so I wanted entertainment - and WHOA was this one off base. Walked out after 20 min and I don't care a damn what happened to Joker. Penguin would be more interesting by a yard mile. I am sorry folks - disagree with all of you. Piece of junk."
2042,"I'm a great fan of the Dark Knight Joker and I can say with absolute confidence this movie DOES NOT deserve any rating close to Dark Knight. DC must go back to Nolan to bring back the Joker that we love. Acting 7.5, overall movie 5.5. Rotten is lenient to give it 69. That brings me to question the validity of IMDb reviews. I'm telling you they are simply FAKE!"
2043,"A waste of time and brain cells. If you want the story of Joker, watch Batman. This is anything but the Joker. Just the story of an old mentally disabled guy, pathetic and sad rather than scary, sometimes even disgusting. His laugh, overacted by JP in way too many and too long scenes, is annoying and stupid; it does not, by any means, convey the emotions of a cruel vilan. Also, the age of the Joker (sorry JP) does not fit the timeline, he is way too old.
If you're a true Batman fan this is not the movie for you."
2044,"Right, with all the praise and hype that the 2019 movie ""Joker"" from director Todd Phillips have been getting, this is very much a movie that you'd eventually find your way to watching.I did so too, and let me just say that expectations were high when I sat down to watch ""Joker"". Expectations that the movie didn't live up to. Man, this movie was definitely not my cup of tea.First of all, the pacing of the movie. Talk about being prolonged and dragging on, without nothing much of any real worth happening. Sure Joaquin Phoenix did a great job in his acting performance as Arthur Fleck and the gradual downward sloping trip towards becoming the Joker.But the storyline wasn't really one that did much to get me worked up. Director Todd Phillips took quite his time to get from A to B, and without dishing out much in terms of phenomenal storytelling and movie presentation along the way.There was one scene, a single scene, that was glorious, and it was when Arthur Fleck was on the Murray Franklin show and what happened to Murray Franklin on live TV. That scene actually had me laughing. But the rest of the movie was somewhat of a slow-paced drag to sit through. Sure, it was somewhat entertaining, but awfully slow paced. However, this is hardly a movie that I will be watching a second time around.Aside from Joaquin Phoenix in the lead, the movie also bolstered performances from the likes of Robert De Niro and Frances Conroy, whom individually were adding something good to the movie, just a shame that they didn't have more screen time.I don't understand why critics are so worked up about this movie, I honestly don't. It wasn't all that particularly outstanding or entertaining. Sure, it is a movie about an iconic villain in the DC universe, but that is about as far as it goes.I am rating this overhyped and overrated movie a less than mediocre four out of ten stars."
2045,"I don't often review movies but as an avid movie goer I just can't see what the fuss is about.
Movies are made to entertain and enrich, bring joy, elation and all the emotions that human beings are capable of.
The Joker does none of this.
True it is a masterclass in acting and Phoenix truly is superb but as a piece of film entertainment it falls very short.
It lumbers along for too long trying to build a picture of a broken man who finally snaps and in today's society that really could be anyone.
Everyone is stressed, times are hard and it doesn't take much to push someone to the edge.
The flashes of what will eventually become the Joker as we know him are very far and few between and in these moments between the movie languishes into a portrait of self pity.
Great acting. Great actor. Not a great movie."
2046,"This is a very different movie from Endgame, so stop the comparisons. If you must compare it to something, compare it to other movies with Joker in it. Nicholson, Ledger, Leto, that's all fine and good. But do not compare it to something that is a different context. If you must compare to a Marvel product, then how bout Logan...if you must. That's even a stretch. Comparing it to the other just shows how biased you are towards DC and or Marvel. Just give your observation and leave it at that. No comparison needed. It should be able to stand or fall on it's own merit alone."
2047,Never felt so depressed after coming out from seeing a film.
2048,"This movie is boring overrated
They ruined it
And the people who gives 10 ?
I think they dont know much about movies"
2049,I keep waiting the whole movie for something to happen but nothing happened. The movie is very boring and slow the plot is simple and bad overall I don't recommend this movie to anyone it's a waste of 2 hours of my life.
2050,Would have given it a 5 but wanted to counteract all the false reviews here
2051,"Extremly boring,,,,,acting is great,,,but full time boring,,,,"
2052,"It's sad to see that people do not have their own opinions and they will like whatever is trending in pop culture.The acting from Joaquin Phoenix started good. Than he starts to oversell it. Every 10 minutes he either laughed very hard or danced around. He was like Jim Carry. That was his acting. And people are thinking that he deserves an oscar. There is a very thin line between crazy and psycho. Joker is a very dark psycho person, that makes his character unique. What Joaquin represented was flat crazy trying to be a psycho. An epic fail.But his acting still the best thing in this picture. There were some good scenes but the story, logic, sound editing and designing sucked. They tried to hype some scenes with a very laud music which will come to you attention because of the lack of the professionalism.I liked the cinematography. It catches the darkness and the dangerousness of the situation. The lightning also played a very big part in this success. It made some scenes much better.To sum things up, there in no way, this movie deserves an oscar, it shouldn't even be considered for it. I am really disappointed. I've waited something more dark and more psychological. Very disappointed"
2053,"I don't understand how people like this movie so much. It is extremely slow paced and boring. You have to wait almost an hour before anything interesting happens. Some of the camera shots are extremely annoying espaically the over repeated use of characters taking up the wrong space of each shot. Alot of the shots are just blank nothings that drag on, possibly to add suspense but it doesn't work if the film is boring to begin with.The fact that this guy even turns into the joker is extremely unbelievable. He isn't smart or good at using his intuition like the actual joker would. To think this guy would be batman's greatest foe is embarrassing.If it was a stand alone movie unrelated to the batman series then I would of appreciated it more.The main characters acting was decent but he wasn't given a good enough script to display anything worthy of an Oscar. Half the movie he is just dancing. Give him a strictly come dancing award, not an Oscar.Don't believe the hype, the movie is mediocre at best and predictable. It wasn't worth making childcare arrangements for. Wish I just watched it at home so I could have just turned it off when I got bored."
2054,"Look, in some aspects the film is a triumph. The way it has been shot is beautiful, the score is excellent, there is a true depression to the film that feels authentic and the performance from Phoenix is flawless.The main problem is that the Joker is supposed to be the archetype of a super villain, causing chaos where ever he goes, charming, intelligent and ultra violent. Phoenix's Joker is as far removed from this depiction as possible; a pathetic loser that only by luck it seems fulfils his destiny. Whilst I really enjoyed the premise of the film - a slow decent in to insanity, it would have been a lot more effective if the character was a little bit more sociopathic and a lot less self loathing.Another thing that really stood out for me was the lack of subtlety in the script, it seems as if the director has no trust the viewers intelligence, numerous times throughout the film you are basically force fed the narrative as if you could not figure it out for yourself.For all its attempts of being a psychological thriller, the Joker unfortunately misses the mark, which makes me just a little bit crazy."
2055,"Compared to other people who disliked this movie because of expectation, I knew that it wouldn't have been a typical comics-based movie, but more of a dark psychological examination of a man. Well, it was trash anyway.The mental disorder was treated in a cartoonish way, while the movie around it wanted you to treat everything as serious and ill and shocking as possible. It would be like making a serious movie about Donald Duck's reasons to not wearing pants, and passing it as a social commentary of some sort. Because we all know that, social commentary = deepness and intelligence!Simply put, this is a great Hollywood product of these days, where movies are created to impress the main viewers (average man and lower) most superficial thoughts, to make them feel they are intelligent and deep watching a profound movie, with deep meaning and incredible social commentary. But, for anybody that has seen enough cinema in his\her life, the trick is easy to spot, both in the direction and the dialogues.The acting is very good in some scenes, but the script he has to work with... oh, poor Phoenix."
2056,"Wouldnt of even given this movie a 1 if i could of...
high rating from a bunch of paid movie critics trying make out this movie is dark and mystic with a underlinning message..... NO it just a bad movie. nothing more.
went from Heath Ledger to this rubbish. i finished watching this thinking how movies from Christian Bale as best batman to Ben Crappy Affleck"
2057,Ugghhh how could I be so wrong in my assessment of Joker when the majority of film goers and film reviewers have rated this abhorrent film an average of 8.6 on IMDB? What have I missed seeing? How can over 600 thousand film goers have liked this film and the film receive 11 Oscar nominations when both Mrs. Shullivan and I just hated it and considered it as much a waste of time as we did with the 1977 acclaimed film Eraserhead?Joaquin Phoenix being nominated for a best actor Oscar? You have got to be kidding me? Maybe he should have been awarded a medal from Weight Watchers for shedding 52 pounds for his pathetic role as the brooding and mentally disturbed Arthur Fleck aka Joker. But an Oscar nomination?We chose to next watch the 2019 film Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood which was nominated for ten (10) Oscars this year and it is competing with Joker's eleven (11) nominations. I will be shocked if Joker wins any Oscars and even more shocked and disappointed if Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood does not win against Joker in any of their competing categories.Let's see if my rating of 3/10 holds true on Oscar night and if Joker gets shut out as I would anticipate it would.
2058,People need to calm down. Yeah the movie is fine. It's not a master piece. He doesn't come close to Leger's performance.I think people are just so attached to the franchise and the fandom that they get blinded.It's an ok movie.
2059,"I left conflicted. I expected more. Don't get me wrong, I like this movie because of Joaquin Phoenix's performance alone but the movie itself lacked.I was on board with the origin story of a man mocked by society and forgotten by the government. I always want to empathize with every character.Somewhere along the movie I lost the connection with him. I found myself more worried about the kid in the back of the theater watching it instead of the plot. I believe all movies, whether intended or not, carry a message. It seemed like they began making the film with a message of empathy and human connection and then they remembered it was a comic book movie and somehow wanted to make him a hero.The character of the villain is a hero only to himself. Weirdly enough that trait is what makes a villain likeable and understable. At the end of the movie I didn't like him and I didn't understand why that was happening.Again great acting but not enough to save the movie for me."
2060,"If you read through the reviews it is mainly two fractions arguing.
Fraction one claim Joaquin is fantastic, this movie is the best thing since sliced bread, and the only question is how many Oscars it should win.
Fraction two argues that this is basically a copy paste movie and it stands on two (or three) previous gigants and the director is a lazy hack.I agree with almost all of that, both sides. Joaquin is great, and the movie is decently made, but it is also stolen and copy pasted and on a second viewing the movie get very boring, and most of it make little to no sense anymore.
On second viewing focusing on details you notice a lot of mistakes and a lot of the dialogue which is surprisingly bad.And Oscars? Please! I think many in the committee think as many others do and personally I do not think they should reward copy paste movies with almost zero originality with trophies.The main issue I have with this movie is, seemingly opposite almost everyone else, is that I feel it is too short. They never fully develop all the side characters, the Joker is almost the only focus, which sort of work due to great acting, but if you are going to really 100% care about the protagonist he/she also need to face up against something, and the surrounding need to matter. This movie develops and show Joker, that it is. This is a one-man show and a psychological downward spiral, which is fine, but not something to build an entire movie on.Anyone claiming this is a masterpiece have never seen a movie before. Or they are lying to you.This is not as bad as Alita or as horrible as Us, I would put this on par with that awful Endgame movie. 2/10."
2061,This will be a classic. Joaquin Phoenix did an outstanding job.
2062,"The movie is just so sad. I felt uncomfortable, sad and depressed the entire time. Is that what the movie was supposed to do? Yea sure. But I left the movie theatre with such a gut wrenching feeling in my stomach and I cried for about an hour. It is two hours that will make you feel awful and sad, but the ending is kinda cool."
2063,This is the first time in my life I have ever walked out of a movie I actually asked for a refund. Horrible. Don't waste your money.
2064,Heath Ledger... hands down! Too much hype. Phoenix will most probably get the Oscar but not for me thanks.
2065,"Joaquin did his job, kudos; it was a tough role. I understand that it's the backstory character development of the Joker. Sorry, I love movies of all genres, but this was simply not entertaining. I didn't want to walk out, but I didn't want to stay. Too heavy for too long. How many depressing things need to be spoon fed to get the point that he's depressed and ready to react? For all those Keith Ledger comments, perhaps they are paid reviews. Keith Ledger's character was interesting, inventive and charismatic (in a maniacal way), this character is depressed, dark and creepy (in an uninteresting way).If you love the Batman ecosystem, great, this probably fills a gap. If you have some relationship with mental illness and you need a cathartic moment, great, this may catalyze a reaction. But, if you want a well-paced and well-told entertaining story, perhaps a different choice for the evening."
2066,And those are the two best things about this horrible film. It is now the yardstick against which future boring movies will be measured.
2067,"Probably one of the best movies about mental illness ever made. Joaquin is tremendous in the role of Arthur - suffering from years of neglect, abuse and bullying he finally does a Michael Douglas in Falling Down and it's a sight to behold.It's not as violent as the media would have you believe. Films like John Wick are far more violent. The killings in this are much shorter, less action packed, and are a lot more real.Excellent performances all round.Probably the best DC movie to date. Roll on Joker 2"
2068,"This movie has some of the best acting I have ever seen, Joaquin Phoenix made a statement for the acting GOAT however the movie had one of the thinnest plots of any movie I have ever seen & it felt like the movie was made as an after thought to someone who wanted to make a statement about Mental Illness."
2069,"I never got a chance to watch this movie in cinema all of my college friends and lecturers watch it and everyone was liking it, where I was waiting for it's digital release and I'm glad I didn't waste my money on cinema ticket.JOKER a Joke just over hyped, over rated and overall OVER movie, acting was fine direcrion was just ok plot was weak and draged.The success of the this movie was created by paid critics who wrote good reviews and gave it a 10 stars or so and rest follow the like fools."
2070,"Joker as the character portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix was developed rather well. he is a great actor and once again his presence was awesome. No complaints there.
BUT!!! Joker starts out as a 40 year old dude in the movie and in the last scene at Arkham more like 50+ while Bruce Wayne is a 12 year old child at the same time.
Yet in every universe or interpretation of the DC universe Joker and Batman are arch enemies and they are roughly the same age. how does this not bother everyone watching this movie?? There is no DC universe timeline where this BS can work at all. the age gap is far too big and (to me) it is extremely disturbing. joker next to this is not an imbecile, loser turned murderer turned psychopath. Joker is a chemical engineering mastermind.
The movie was to be watched as a separate entity from ANY previous DC Batman story - which is absurd given Jokers obsession with Batman and then being enemies; but fine - this is a different Joker. But then when you can almost relate to the absurd idea that Joker is in a separate timeline or universe - the movie re-enacted the Wayne parents murder exactly the same way as every single Batman / Joker story; and Joker was in Arkham Asylum at the end also exactly like ""it should be"" . So it's not a different Joker and not a different universe?!?! but then back to my original point this plot makes no bloody sense (in terms of age - timeline).
besides this extreme major flaw - the interactions of Joker with the detectives and the complete inaction of the police after the initial murders and while he is on the TV show also makes no sense... The plot is basically infuriatingly full of holes; and weak as hell - it mixes original story elements with a complete misrepresentation of Joker.. Joaquin Phoenix carries this movie, no doubt - but if you ever read DC comics or watched any Batman interpretation - you must be at least questioning the logic. Joker literally appeared in the first Batman episode and sure there were some different representations; but this was a mix and match with no logic. Sorry for the spoilers, but the movie doesn't work as a flashback or flash-forward or even as an imaginary story in Joker's head. I hated it; once again DC took something that could have been a generation defining movie and f-ed up (like Pretty much everything the past 30 years). Again, if you are a fan of Joaquin Phoenix (and who isn't) the movie is very watchable. But if you are a fan of DC comics, and have even basic understanding of the Joker/Batman adversity - this has to be one of the dumbest things ever. (Sorry)"
2071,"The most insulting thing about this movie is that the writers clearly think that they are ""bringing awareness"" to mental illness, when in fact they are not only exploiting it but providing a grossly inaccurate portrayal of mental illness, ironically even making fun of it despite its shallow criticism of people who make fun of the mentally ill. I don't know exactly what type of mental illness Joaquin Phoenix is trying to mimic here, but there is no existing illness that is remotely similar to this. His acting comes across as somebody who has heard rumors about mentally ill people but never had any exposure to anybody with any form of mental illness. This is a step backwards in Hollywood's effort to capitalize off of stereotypes of ""crazy"" people, an ignorant, distasteful mockery even exceeding that of Dirty Harry. The fact that this film has received such positive reviews only shows just how far society really is from understanding and accepting mental illness."
2072,"It's a good film but I don't see this as a 10 like many here did, early reviews are usually from some marketing company to hype things up.Movie started slow ... don't expect much to happen 'til the middle and it's climax. Cinematography is good. Joker's acting is fine... if a little forced at times, it's just strange but acceptable."
2073,"I am stunned. I actually feel sick after watching this piece of trash. I can not believe this is the caliber of movies being produced now. Terrible, just Terrible."
2074,Movie glorified evil and irrationality in the beginning. It acquired some meaning towards the end. If it wasn't for the cinematography it would have never managed to engage such a vast audience.
2075,"No words no words just an amazing movie with all things needed to establish the joker !!!!
This movie is beyond awards 😍😍😍😍"
2076,"Honestly and considering miself as someone who does know about cinema
You need a lot of confidente to play the joker
Phoenix probes us that with actitud everyting is posible
The best pinture of the year
A true Classic"
2077,The absolute worst movie I have ever seen... complete and utter garbage!
2078,"Yes folks, have your ear-buds plugged into your phone and settled in your ears and have your favorite podcast cued up with the ""PLAY"" button on the ready, because 20 solid minutes of this movie are nothing but Joker-to-be having laughing fits or doing slo-mo dances. That's how we know he's going crazy! Every 15 minutes or so the ""plot"" pauses for a shakey-cam, weird-angled, slo-mo mess of nothing while we hostages are forced to sit unengaged and watch.No spoilers here, because the movie is simply the trailer X 100. Half-crazy weirdo in ugly, dirty city gets picked on and betrayed, then goes full-killer crazy. There is not a moment of subtlety or curiosity, nothing for you to wonder about in terms of what will happen next. Your two modes of viewership are CRINGE alternating with YAWN.Don't tell me this is great psychology. It's NOT. Just imbue a guy with Daddy and Mommy issues, make some cliche reveals about his lousy childhood (as if we didn't know it was bad), and photograph him in one scene after another laughing insanely, dancing in slo-mo, and getting stabby/shooty.Happy tunes from the 50s through 80s play over Joker's weirdness -- get it? It's irony! Bet you've never seen that before!The movie is literally ugly, with muddy lighting and uncomfortable angles. Yes, I get that it's supposed to be a depressing, discomfiting story about the inside of a sicko's mind, but a better director could have depicted real life without making the movie literally hard to watch. That's largely because there is NO PSYCHOLOGY in this movie. It's just a repetitious, collage of every cliche about madness and badness since you were sitting around in your sleeping bags telling urban legends.I hesitated to give a one-star review because people will dismiss me as a hata, but I honestly think this movie deserves it."
2079,This movie is absolute garbage. Complete waste of time and energy
2080,"I totally agree with a review I read early. It's plagiarism at its best. And besides that there is no story, no plot... Pheonix, who is an actor that I like, gives a fairly good performance, but clearly at times is overacting.
I remember reading about an argument between Phoenix and De Niro about a scene before I saw the movie. Now I'm wondering which one was it, since they had only 2."
2081,"Nothing makes this movie touches my 8-star list.The cinematography is neat beautiful by the way, but I couldn't find any scene that supposedly will be remembered as a great shot. Sorry, I just couldn't find it.The screenplay is having difficulty to built a grand climax. I mean, I wish they asserted a unique traumatic event life which built the Joker persona, but it was not there. Being bullied, losing mom, I think will only ended up in a regular villain, but you can see this kind of plot in many movies. What makes those experience special? Helloooo... you are building a super-villain here. The conflict in this story is not complicated enough to produce a Joker.This is a great drama, not a super hero movie. Let's put it that way.Joaquin Phoenix is a superior actor and he acted amazing, period.
He didn't bring that ""searching & confused"" eyes that you find in people who have mental disorder. Ledger and Leno on the other hand displayed them, which perfectly represent a character with an awfully troubled mind. I understand, Ledger and Leno's Joker is a fully developed Joker, while Joaquin's played the Joker in the making, in his early stage of madness. The madness level between early Joker and older Joker might be different. Love Joaquin's acting. The screenplay man... ugh.Cinematography is excellent. Consistent tonal and color grading, from start to end. I appreciate that it is showing a brighter Gotham than previous movies with Joker in it, nothing's wrong with that, it gives a different look of Gotham. Again I considered this more a drama movie than an action (super hero) movie, so the suspense should not be generated from the action scene but from the storytelling or conflicts. I wish I saw a bit chaotic camera motion to add suspense to character, but I only saw that in the train fight. I don't understand the shot in which Arthur Fleck sitting down on the side of his mom's hospital bed and taken from behind (only showing his side/back). What the heck? The back shot is supposed to be used to emphasize the subject/object in front of the character, which was Peggy Fleck lying still on the bed. What on earth interesting about it?!!! The shot taken from the opposite angle (from the bed towards Arthur Fleck) is stronger than that.7-star is enough. I enjoy the movie. Tone down the hype guys, you are delusional to give this a 9, on par with The Godfather."
2082,"A film with a laudable performance by Phoenix. The film highlights several unpleasant aspects:
1. The PBA disturbance which I doubt the masses(which includes me) are aware of and the traumatic life such a person may lead
2. The effects of the lack of medication for such a disturbance or the effectiveness of such medicines, in first place
3. The never-ending saga of bullying
4. The general insensitivity of the media and talk show hosts.The background score of the movie is good but is an overkill.The screenplay of the movie, the themes and the in general the origin story/retrofit is not only unconvincing and flawed but also seems to deliver a wrong message.
1. The obsession of linking Joker/Fleck to the Wayne family - Fleck's mother's history, Wayne Enterprise employees beating up Fleck and finally the ideological assassination of the Wayne family by a protester
2. Fleck being adopted and having suffered childhood abuse is such a lame and clichéd plot aspect used by the writers
3. Plausible:
Lack of medication, disturbing discoveries and sort of revenge causes Fleck to go on a killing spree and even enjoying the attention that he receives unexpectedly
Implausible:
Social commentary by Fleck on the show, his sudden liking to riots and chaos. I couldn't believe that they send a detective/psychiatrist to meet Fleck in jail but she's unaware of his disorder and thinks that a PBA-suffering Fleck is laughing at some joke!! Seriously? Are the police and other agencies do dumb to not investigate history of such a criminal?
4. While it's unfair to go into too much of details, I don't understand how a person who likes to dance and become a stand-up comedian would end up having a predilection and some talent in chemical weapons, dynamite, explosives etc. Which are Joker's speciality? Is the viewer supposed to assume that the Fleck cultivates these skills from scratch after he turns into 'Joker'?
5. Last but the most important point - Joker, as we know since ages, is a class-I psychopath who feels no remorse or emotions and enjoys killings and chaos. While such psychopaths get a bit influenced by their surroundings, they are genetically/pathologically having some issues that makes them what they are. In this movie, they somehow try to come up with a cocktail of reasons that give rise to Joker. The worse part is the that riots, vandalism and criminal activities are portrayed as a natural outcome of expressing your discontent.Overall, the movie is a poor origin story of an iconic psychopath like Joker. Watch it as an independent psychological thriller but not as a 'Rise of Joker' film."
2083,"It borrows a lot of elements to strive for an award nod. Well, except for good writing and acting. They even shamelessly use PEOPLE WALKING OUT OF THEATRE as hype for this movie. As if it was because it is too edgy or scary. Brain damaged sissy dances while being annoying and rude to everyone. Then expects society to put him on a pedestal. The end."
2084,"A question before you read below. What are you reviewing when you say 10/10? A performance by an actor or the storyline?The best part of the movie first of all... Phoenix PLAYED the Joker literally, the best character performance I've seen from ANY actor. Hats off and 10/10 for performance. I am not discrediting his performance whatsoever.Now here is the reason for 5 stars. The film was long drawn out, long winded, and I kept looking at my watch... if this was any other movie, people would be agreeing with me, jumping on my band-wagon and saying the same thing. You could easily create this storyline within 20 minutes, half an hour at a BIG push, I mean... Do we really want to know E-V-E-R-Ything about him?The movie isn't a villian based movie nor superhero movie I was/am aware of that, however the movie is a 'Halloween' meets 'IT' movie where a Physcotic Mental Escapee decides to kill at will. Sounds like a storyline I've seen before.... Michael Myers would be proud.Everyone is saying ""Brilliant movie"" but is it because you love Pheonix's performance or love the actual storyline? Because most reviews I've read are 10/10 based on the characters performance.. that is not how reviews of movies ought to be.So, please review the actual storyline, rather than the actual characters performance. Based on character performance, I've said 10/10. Based on the long winded drawn out process of a storyline, 5/10.This is how the movie should receive it's reviews."
2085,Its just an ok movie.although Joaquin phoenix did give an award worthy performance.but the movie was not that great.don't believe the fanboys
2086,"JokerWords completely fail me, I just had to sit through two hours of watching an alcoholic in Judy and now I am made to sit for two hours watching a lunatic in Joker. In both I was neither educated, entertained or informed. Both movies were utter cobblers and should be cast into the void where they will find the ultimate turkey that is Carry-On Columbus.This purported to be an origin story of master villain extraordinaire, Joker. We got zilch on how he became a master criminal, he had no henchmen, we had no bank robbery, we had no car chase, we had no joker, and on top of that his arch nemesis Batman was a small boy when they were contemporaries. This was incoherent nonsense.Joaquin Phoenix's performance had so many problems,1, he dominated the movie by being in every scene, true, but the story was so unfocused it became an interpretation of a man struggling with a mental health condition. The main problem was the Joker was not an interesting character, he was bland, predictable and revolting.2, his characterisation rested upon physicality, he lost weight, he was half naked, he contorted his body, with the inference twisted body twisted mind, does Hollywood really think an audience can be duped by such an obvious trick, this was no Raging Bull or Dallas Buyers Club. I wanted to pass the hat around the cinema to raise funds to buy him a shirt and then make him wear it.3, We had raw method style from Joaquin that was largely improvised to fill the void. There must always be a reason behind behaviour otherwise it is meaningless and so it was here.4, The Joker, unsurprisingly, it's in the name, was funny, if he was sad, it was pathos, this was unremittingly morose. Jack Nicholson's performance captured this but it was absent here.This was a miserable, instantly forgettable movie that lacked any focus or story. Around me there was a constant stream of people walking out who felt they had been sold a pig-in-a-poke, and went to watch Aladdin instead, as did I."
2087,"Murder is not a good response to bullying. Murder is not a solution to wealth inequality. Are these truths not self evident to you as they are to me? Yet there are lots of people here saying they empathise with Joker? How? I couldn't get into this movie at all, because the main character's motivations are entire alien to me. I don't get him. I don't get this movie. I don't get how anybody can enjoy this movie.This movie is depressing. The tone is dark, all of the characters are terrible people, and there is violence in every other scene from beginning to end for 2 hours. How does anybody get entertained by this?Is it OK now to portray the mentally ill like this?! So if you take away their therapy and their pills, the mentally ill will just all turn into insane criminals full of hatred? This is gross misrepresentation. In 50 years time, we will look back on this misrepresentation of the mentally ill the same way we look at blackface minstrel shows about negroes today."
2088,"""Joker"" doesn't wait long to begin inflicting harm.In the opening scene, we watch Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) stare into a mirror as he pulls up the corners of his mouth, forcing a smile. It's an early indication of the unhappiness that has brewed inside Arthur all his life. It's also an early indication of the unhappiness we're about to endure for next two hours.""Joker"" is a miserable watch. It's endlessly depressing, containing not a single ounce of happiness, humor or hope. Arthur's daily existence as a struggling performing clown consists of nothing but loneliness and grim thoughts, much like what I felt during my time in the theater. It is a burden to sit through this movie.The never-ending cavalcade of sadness and loathsome behavior we witness on screen does not contain nearly enough depth to be worthy of the debate that raged for months in advance of the premiere. The movie is flat out bad. It's derivative of better movies (namely, Taxi Driver & The King of Comedy), unnecessarily violent, and annoyingly over-the-top. But the movie's greatest flaw is that is boring.Nothing interesting or unexpected occurs. Some of the events could have passed for interesting if they had not been painstakingly foreshadowed by the previous hour of mundane bleakness.Every scene essentially delivers the same message: Arthur lives in a world of poverty, torment, and loneliness. Arthur is lonely at work, on the bus, in the elevator, while watching tv - every scene tells the same story. Watching the string of scenes one after another quickly grows tired and dull. It's all painfully repetitive and frustratingly one note. The presence one scene depicting an auspicious event, any reason for hope or happiness would have given a much welcome break from the monotonous misery.Sadly, that break in tone arrives in the form of explosive bursts of violence. Lost on no one is the fact that Arthur has a mental illness, which undoubtedly contributes to his violent fits of rage - this sends the message to viewers that these sorts of people are dangerous and frightening. It's a reckless and problematic depiction of a person suffering from mental illness, one that only serves to perpetuate an already damaging stigma.Any earnest exploration carried out by the movie into the lack of help provided to individuals with mental illness was too superficial to make a real impact. A potential tagline for the movie ""Society created the Joker"" has about as much depth as the movie itself. Sure, that idea is lightly implied, but it's not unpacked in any meaningful way during the two-hour runtime.Any social issues aside, the main reason I didn't enjoy the movie is because it's simply not a good movie. All reports suggest that this movie is a one off and will have no sequels. I can only hope that's true.I suggest finding something else to watch, like one of the many superior films available in theaters or via streaming. If you don't, the joke is on you."
2089,"My expectations was high, but movie is too dark and intense, if anyone want to see a real joker should watch the dard knight, wasted my money and time"
2090,"I must say I'm disappointed. I love the Batman universe and especially the story behind Joker. Considering it's been a lot of talk around this movie, I expected more. The first half of the movie was pretty long drawn, towards the end it was great but not so much before that in my opinion. They could have done so much more with the time they had.
Also, something that I struggle with is that every move Joker made was very predictable basic psychology (my opinion). Joker isn't supposed to be predictable, that is a part that makes him so interesting. Besides from all that the actor did an amazing job potraying Joker!"
2091,"First , this movie made me start an account to write a ""review "" .
I completely dont understand all the good ratings and praise for this movie .
Also it always hurts when this type of movie could have lot to offer , but for me was nothing more then total let down .
I dont like the Joker caracter at all in this movie , not a good joker in my book .
Combined with a story that doesnt manage to pull me in or do anything at all for me , i felt this movie was boring pretty quick , and im an easy goin guy that can manage to put brain on hold for a movie if needed , normally it would take some longer before i start thinking ; hey ,i may be watching a bad movie here.
I can handle some graphic violence , i wasnt sure if it really served a purpose here .
Because of all these type of reviews , u start wonder if something is wrong with majority of people , or am i totally out of touch with a new reality .
I never watch any review or trailer beforehand .
I always use this website to find reviews of similar minded people , then have more entertainment then the movie i watched before and gives some piece of mind . To be sure it wasnt me on a bad day i rewatched the movie and still found it complete garbage .
I rate lowest possible because the high scores , but not sure if i would be willing to give any more if had lower rating , as i really did not like anything about it . Because the joker is so badly , wrong displayed in the movie , and i feel a really good movie about the Joker would not be that amazingly hard to make , this is just dissapointing beyond words , all the good reviews , i dont understand at all and is both annoying and disturbing ."
2092,"Ok im not one of those crazy film critics. I watch movies for the enjoyment and entertainment of it. Because of the hype of this movie I was very excited to watch it. OMG. I was sooooo bored. Theres no climax at all. He did an awesome performance in the movie for sure. Outstanding. But as a movie goer, I like to be entertained and feel like the movie was worth my time. I found myself wishing the darn movie will end sooner to end my suffering."
2093,"Allow me to be the critic. I was not impressed with this film nor did I find it funny, clever, or really even remotely interesting.My G/F begged me to watch it with her and I'm sorry, I just could not find anything redeeming about it at all. I asked her honest opinion about it before I gave mine additionally and she said it was really bad and not at all something she would want to see again.I voiced my opinion to her and I think she was surprised. I think she expected that I would've liked it, as a man's film. But I didn't.And this is after she sees the latest Saw movie and Green Inferno and gives those her thumbs up.Heath Ledger in the Dark Knight did so much better. And all the praise he gets is rightly deserved. THAT film is excellent. He was intelligent, cunning, and had a damned interesting personality and mental design. And THAT particular Joker is tops compared to this schizophrenic mess by the same name.This is crap. Plain and simple. Violence for the sake of violence. The story is disjointed and ugly. With big time emphasis on ugly. There are zero scenes in here I would ever care to see again.Scenes are set-up like cardboard dolls specifically playing out predictable and disgusting designs for the sole sake of predictable shock value.If there is one point of interest, I see how highly it is rated by the general public and I suspect this is not artificial inflation but the state of our reviewers today, and if there is anything worse than this movie it surely must be the people who rate it so highly as artistic and cult-worthy.If this is what is desirable, mindless violence and deeply disturbing psychotic behavior, than so be it. But I won't be a part of it - I won't support it - I won't watch it.I only give this two marks. One for the obvious amount of work that went into this train wreck, obvious nods to the original Batman saga, and two it had some memorable music at points. But not enough for me to EVER watch it again. Disgusting waste of my time and money.

2094,This movie is such a beautiful tribute to taxi driver and the king of comedy by Scorsese. Phoenix deserves absolutely an oscar for his joker and Todd Phillips.... he proved to be monstrously good at the direction like never before. Just applause
2095,"Bored from 10 min in. Uneven and jumpy story with little point. Waste of time. The acting was absolutely on point, however, the directing and cinematography was beyond lacking."
2096,I want my two hours back. Went with friends and we were all disappointed. It will get awards like Chicago and Moonlight -- also trash. Joaquim laughs and cries for two hours. Just no.
2097,"The acting in this movie was superb and the music was excellent. That being said, I was disappointed that they painted the joker as someone with a schizophrenic disorder. The stigma of mental illness is already a problem that plagues society, it's disappointing for Hollywood to continue to endorse the negative stigma. In reality, the majority of crimes are not committed by people who are mentally ill. Also, there is no way they would have stopped a persons medicine cold turkey just because they ran out of funds. They always refer them to someone who can fill their medication, especially when someone is severely mentally ill. In reality, the social worker who didn't refer him to someone would have been held legally liable for the murders."
2098,"The Joker on The Dark Night is a highly intelligent person who holds deep conversations with prominent people, capable of planning a complicated bank robbery and was one step ahead of Batman, the police and intelligence. He has a strong personality free from emotionality and he laughed controllably.
I can't see how this mentally unstable person on this Joker becomes that awesome Joker."
2099,Still heath ledger best joker ever this movie sucks
2100,"The movie ""Joker"" is one HUDGE disappointment. COMPLETELY waste of 2 hours. This movie is so disgusting, violent, brutal and stupid that you will barely stand till the end. There is no meaning at all. One of the worst reality of the life in a fiction city. It reminds me to another movie ""Trainspotting"" or ""Fight Club"". But ""Joker"" is sick as hell. We were 4 people in the cinema hall and 2 left in the middle - good for them. Sick, stupid and broken people. I am sorry to be so colorful with words but I just can't stand anymore. I am a cinema maniac and I have watched more than 4000 movies. This is definitely the worst ever. One mixture of loathsome and heinous. What kind of sick mind created it?? Moreover ...how-come Robert DeNiro agreed to be inside.....? Come ooon. I would pay if I haven't watched it.So, people.....PLEASE....DON'T WATCH THIS"
2101,"I don't understand why a typical viewer would care about a cinematography great acting work of a dillusioned and psychopath. Indeed a masterpiece of a frick, a true and vivid depiction of a disturbing man's evil character and violence with an irritating laugh that spreads paranoia and chills to the viewer. It's just a very well mastered work of a drama and at some point justification of evil and criminal acts of a disabled man.. No action, no good story, no other heroes, not something special. And definately not for the young audience who were misled to think that they would watch some action adventure batman-like movie. Not at the slightest point..
Last but not least.. I believe it sends disturbing messages, justifying the evil to ""evil"" or just ""guilty"" people and TOO LONG for a movie of this style, a waste of time not offering anything to a person who just needs to enjoy themselves for an evening..
ps: I also feel that the poor actor after this film may suffer from the same or similar illness of the character he was depicting so truely.."
2102,"I don't understand the 10/10 reviews for this movie. Slow, no excitement, plot was bland. There isn't much to be said about this movie. Phoenix made the worst mistake an sctor can make. One of the GOAT actors Denzel Washington once said, ""never let the camera catch you acting."" Phoenix's acting looked so forced. Such a failure."
2103,"While I can appreciate the darkness of the movie and the laughter of Joker, I couldn't find anything worthwhile to make me enjoy the production. It lacks any true history of Joker and Batman. It is some whacko spin doctor's version of what made Joker The Joker.I didn't like it."
2104,"One could loose his mind from bullying and tragic lies. Check.
Showing ribs after weight loss. Check.
Having an irritating laugh. Check
New origin story. CheckAnd...that's that.
The viewers got hyped, the critics were dazzled.
Shout-out to Cameron Monaghan of Gotham TV series for bringing into the small screen a truly special version of the Joker!"
2105,"A few friends told me that I'd like this movie. My brother told me I'd hate it. I'd have to side with my sibling on this one.I'll just say that Joaquin has been one of my favorite actors for a while now. Her and The Master catapulted him to the top of the list for me.He took this Joker role and he completely owned it. No qualms in that department. But overall this movie just felt like a discount Taxi Driver.Once you remove what everyone and their grandmothers decided to get upset about - heavy handed portrayals of mental illness, public shootings - you really don't get an entertaining or believable movie.In my opinion, if you are going to sacrifice validity, you need to inject some entertaining qualities within the movie, but there were neither of those elements.Yes, mental health awareness is an important topic, but if anyone went into a superhero movie expecting to get an illuminating, lucid look into madness, you were setting yourself up to be disappointed.Yes, public shootings are terrible and tragic, but this movie is a non-sequitur in respect to shootings because it's a superhero villain origin story. It never really moves beyond its own lore to be anything but a caricature of insanity and sociopathy.There are important things to be gleaned from this movie, if you look hard enough. But as far as being a believable or entertaining film...it fails on both accounts.Good acting though."
2106,"Without question the best movie of 2019 and probably more years can be included. It's just simply fantastic. The music, colors, Joaquin's performance... this is one of those rare movies I can watch at home and not be distracted by my phone or anything else; it consumes you like movies did before we had these phones and everyone went a.d.d. Everyone calls it dark, sure, but it's brilliant first. Simply fantastic."
2107,"This movie was made by expert psychologists! This movie is far beyond filmography.I also think main actor should get enough money to take a long, long pause from movie making. Pure 10... 11!"
2108,"Best movie I've seen all year. The character development was amazing and had so much depth. It actually had me feeling empathy for this guy. It was an amazingly movie from the first scene to the last. Even the closing song of the movie was incredibly placed and timed. A masterpiece of cinematography, story, dialogue, and timing. It really stepped us through his dimentia and made us believe it. Another fine example of a movie that causes us to willingly suspend our disbelief. Juaquin Phoenix was perfectly cast."
2109,This is one of the best movies i've seen. thank you
2110,Joaquin is so good and in this movie he shines best. That little dance he does is just so creepy yet nice dance moves. Great movie from beginning to end.
2111,"Joaquin phoenix ,take a bow .....and an oscar subscription. If you ever looked up acting in the dictionary you'll get , what Joaquin did as joker. There has never been a better performance by an artist, maybe at par but none better.
The movie is just a MASTERPIECE."
2112,"Holy crap, this is what you must call a MASTERPIECE!!!
I don't understand the people who doesn't love this movie. this the best movie I've ever seen, it has a superb story, excellent actors (especially Joaquin Phoenix who did a really great job) and also really meaningful events and some very good action scenes!
It has a perfect start, a perfect continuance and a perfect ending to a perfect story!!!IT'S A PERFECT MOVIE AND A MASTERPIECE DON'T MISS IT!!!!!!!!!!!"
2113,"Great direction, photography... everything. Phoenix's performance is, as per usual, absolutely on point. This film reaches way, way beyond the boundaries of the Batman universe."
2114,"ACTING - 7.5/10
Joaquin Phoenix kept this movie from being a 5, but the other actors kept acting from being 8. Robert de Niro was disappointing, he felt tired and his dialogue itself was clunky. Frances Conroy was distracting and hard to believable.MUSIC - 4/10
The original orchestral score was less than bland, with the song choices being highly inappropriate for the tone of the movie (Rock 'n' Roll (Part 2)). The sound editing was really distracting and overall poor.EDITING - 5.5/10
Annoying and uninspired. The edits were at points counterproductive, mixing past dream like sequences with the next scene; not purposefully working to make the audience question the reality of the movie, rather, carelessly confusing the audience.PRODUCTION DESIGN - 7.5/10
This is the only other category I enjoyed from the movie. Gotham looked well constructed as a whole, but there were quite a few cheesy elements that tried to be smart. Internal settings were, for the large part, well done.WRITING - 5.5/10
The movie begins asks many questions it fails to answer or even finish asking. The story was very confused, not knowing what it wanted from many of the aspects, Sophie was useless and was basically used to show how Arthur was crazy, stalks, and hallucinates.
A wasted character or at least wasted time. Why the did they include a single black mother and only have her as a quasi-love interest.
Few too many coincidences, did Arthur even do anything in relation to the movement? Was it going to happen anyway, just without clown masks?
The 80s setting was also useless. I feel that it was only there to make the movie seem more sophisticated through the inclusion of class warfare and smoking.
The main monologue at the end was really forced, as was the unnecessary fan service.
A lot of the writing they wanted to seem realistic and gritty and different from other superhero movies came off as unrealistic and cheesy.CINEMATOGRAPHY - 5.5/10
Damn was the framing and blocking bad. And the composition. And shot type. Very distracting. Breaking 180 degree rule without reason like 4 times in a row because its convenient for the camera? Sure. Slow motion for the purpose of seeming arty, and smarty? Yep."
2115,"I saw the movie today...TWICE...everything in this film is perfect. now i understand why here in greece(europe's Iran),they forbit it for teenagers. its a MUST SEE for young people so they will not let the system turn them to its pawns."
2116,"WHAT A WATCH, I THOUGHT END GAMES WAS GREAT BUT THIS WAS WHAT YOU CALL A MASTERPIECE, IT WAS UNEXPECTED, I FOUND MY SELF SMILING WITH THE JOKER AS I COULD FEEL HIS PAIN, HE THE GUY SITTING 3 CUBES FROM YOU. IT FELT REAL, IT HAD THAT REBELLIOUS V FOR VENDETTA FEEL, I WOULD HAD BEEN RIGHT THERE WITH THEM, WITH MY OWN JOKER MASK. WELL DONE MR. PHOENIX."
2117,Absolutely phenomenal. A sign of a good film is when you leave the theatre pondering what you've just seen for days thereafter. You can immediately feel Arthur's pain from the get go and begin to sympathise with him. It's a simple yet compelling storyline that delves into the problems within our society and how we treat others. It is the first time I have gone twice to see a movie in theatres and I would happily go again.
2118,Absolutely love this movie has the feel of Scorsese and it feels like a true piece of cinema rather then another comic book movie. The score also is so well done everything about this movie just makes it movie of the year.
2119,"I was highly sceptical at first regarding how the movie will turn out to be, going by the plot, I had no doubts about Joaquin, one of the best actors of his generation.
I am so unbelievably impressed by his acting, Todd's direction, the sound, the score, cinematography, the 80s vibe. Its been YEARS I've seen such a great movie with great everything in it. I can understand why some of the critics dislike this movie while they like similar or even more hardcore movies compared to this, one of the main reason has to go to the realistic feel of this movie, i have never seen acting like that ever before. The movie is so realistic and it tackles real life issues that ought to make anyone uncomfortable but in a positive way, i do not think this movie has the potential to incite gun violence etc(please, john wick anyone?), those are just rubbish. And lastly, we can not compare Heath and Joaquin's Joker, they are a class of their own."
2120,"This movie is a masterpiece. If you ever were bullied or have had depressions and felt like everybody is against you, you will feel with the joker through the whole movie.
This movie is unsettling from the get go and gets only worse from there on (but in a good way:)). As we witness how the character - Arthur Fleck, who will become the joker - is gradually sinking into insanity, caused by the selfish and cold world he lives in and by his own psyche.
The role of the Joker is delivered brilliantly by Joaquine Phoenix, who in my opinion, deserves an oscar for it.But beware!
Its a movie unlike other superhero movies. This one is more of a character study of the joker, why he became who he is. I would sort it into the Genre of Drama/Thriller."
2121,"I don't love Joker. As a character I adore him but I don't love the film: Joker. Now while yes the movie is an interesting look into the psyche of the insanely captivating clown Prince of crime, and how he came to be, its also extremely derivative. Let me ask you something. Have you ever seen Taxi Driver? Have you ever seen The King of Comedy? If you have, you've seen Joker. If you haven't, please educate yourself. I wouldn't mind it being so similar to these movies if it didn't tout itself proudly as an original work; the brain child of Todd Phillips. Joaquin Phoenix's performance was great but also it got a bit over the top and, sadly it highlighted the mediocrity of the other performances in the film. Easily the worst part of this film was the horrible social commentary, which genuinely made me wince. I won't go into it but it was so blunt and obvious that it just felt awfully pandering when Joker starts blurting out about society and all this poppycock. I left the cinema underwhelmed and disappointed, following the thunderous praise the film got, and maybe I should have tempered my expectations but wow, is this an overrated film if I've ever seen one. If you disagree with my opinion that is absolutely excellent, and please understand that not everyone has to agree with you. Thanks for reading <3"
2122,"I used to think that it is impossible to fill the shoes of Heath Ledger's Joker, I am a huge fan of his. I was wrong. This was literally the best role I have seen in my life, speechless. The movie was great, but Joaquin was beyond that."
2123,"As someone who isn't that big of a fan of the DCEU thanks to the quality of the films being kind of wonky (a few are great, a few are just okay, a few are really bad), I wasn't expecting that much here, considering that this film, besides having the Joker, has nothing to even do with the DCEU. Plus, as great as Joaquin Phoenix is as an actor, he was never exactly the first guy to come to mind when thinking of who to play the demented clown himself. So, you can imagine my shock and amazement after coming out of the movie theater, because, oh my god, this film is incredible. It takes everything you thought you knew about the Joker and not only flips it on its head, but expands upon it tenfold. The way this film portrays what Arthur is going through and how he evolves into the Joker is some of the best character development I have ever seen in a film. This film has a perfect balance of making you sympathize with the main character, while also making you mindful of the terrible acts he has done. It can feel a bit disturbing to almost side with someone who's obviously dangerous, but the way this film manages that is genius. All of this is helped by two things. Smart and excellent writing, as well as the performance. The story is great. It's well paced, thought provoking, smart, poignant, and constantly almost eye opening. Joaquin Phoenix was pretty much perfect. His performance is Oscar worthy here, as he really did become the main character. When Arthur laughed because of his condition, I really felt the pain behind it. Seeing how his life is and how he lives it really seemed real, and that's what helped me sympathize with him, even though, again, he's dangerous. If all of that wasn't enough, everything else about this movie is great too. The direction from Todd Phillips really shines, as the way this film is structured and put together helps the film not only flow really well, but to be delightfully dark and twisted. The performances from everyone else were all great too. Robert De Niro was phenomenal as Murray Franklin, as he was very committed, which helped him really turn into the talk show host from this film. The same thing can be said for everyone else, whether it be Frances Conroy as Arthur's mother or Zazie Beetz as his love interest. Everyone did great, as well as Todd Phillips for making such an incredible film that delves into the mind of the demented clown while making it extremely heartfelt. I also loved how they linked the Wayne family to the story. I won't say what happened to avoid spoilers, but that really helped this feel like a true part of Batman's past, all of which happened in a movie where the caped crusader isn't even around yet (I hope, because a Batman film after this would be awesome in my opinion). Overall, this film is amazing, and I recommend anyone who hasn't seen it to do so, because it not only has fan service aplenty to longtime fans of the Joker, but it also has everything that makes a great movie great so that it can be enjoyed by anyone. One last thing to note is that there is a lot, and I mean a LOT of gore in this film, so if you're squeamish about that, then I'd probably wait until I'm ready to see it. I say watch this with an open mind, and what you'll experience is a thought provoking masterpiece that tells a story you never thought hard about and tells it damn near perfectly."
2124,It was a privilege to experience this film. Joaquin Phoenix exceeds expectations in every aspect. Director Todd Phillips does an amazing job of delivering such an exhilarating character piece even given the film's contrast to those that he has directed in the past. Joker speaks an unspoken truth about the human condition and is an absolute must-watch.
2125,"I have to admit that I had a certain fear to this film.
The first thing I'm a big DC fan, the Joker is my favorite DC villain, and to make a movie about him without Batman, somehow illogical and unimaginable.
Second, the director is Todd Phillips who has now done only comedies (admittedly good and really good) such as Hangover, Due Date and Road Trip. I knew that Joaquin will be great as he has already proven and rewarded an actor with several great roles, but history has taught me that it's no guarantee because the last Joker was catastrophic and the actor is also a great actor (Jared Leto has an Oscar).I was so wrong.The film is perfect, crafty and brutal.
Most of all it tells me that even after three days of looking at it, I still think about him, about acting, about scenes, about music, about a possible message.
As expected, Joaquin was singled out by the big screen overall. Each scene is his own, he ate the part and ordered the desert afterwards. He brutally gave himself into it, physically and mentally. Honestly, it will be a bigger surprise if he doesn't win an Oscar, but it doesn't even matter given the award history. He showed so many emotions and layers of one fictional character on a larger level, leaning to the floor!
Any comparisons to Ledger are unnecessary, they both did the job to the highest possible level, each with their own version that fits the film. Both are perfect.
I did mind the two minor things in the movie, however they turned it around to fit the story so I have no qualms.
I really like that this can't be called some kind of superhero movie that we've been bombarded with for years, it's a pure psychological drama. It reminded me a lot of the tone and atmosphere of Taxi Driver, even in some scenes one can see the impact and similarities in Martin Scorsese's film. It was as if it was shot in the 1970s which was Hollywood's prime golden age.Honestly, the reactions of film critics, ranging from disappointment to excellent, were not clear to me. In the last few years, you may have 5 films for which you will become a cult classic in the future. The Joker is definitely one of them.Purely subjective and well deserved ten!"
2126,I stayed because we live in a society where you have to watch the joker movie
2127,Overhyped. Redbox worthy at best. Don't waste your time beforehand.
2128,"Couldn't watch till the end. One of the worst movie I've ever seen. Boring, annoying. Left cinema after hour and 20 min. Such a disappointment."
2129,"Heath ledger was the best joker hands down, nice try Phoenix but better luck next time on competing with the work of the goat joker RIP. Movie was a serious disappointment."
2130,"Cheap movie which is using Nolan's Joker's popularity and is targeting teenager audience. Only from 3 try I could watch it. First time I left cinema after first 20 minutes, then I tried to watch it online, I turned it off after 20 minutes and only third time I found strength in me to finish it, just because I kept believing that there will be something worthy. No! Nothing. It was disgusting. Horrible movie. How dare they to spoile a character that is 80 years old, how there they to make from noble Thomas Wayne, such a negative character? Shame, shame. I wish I've never seen it."
2131,"If I forget the fact that the movie is supposed to be the origin story for THE greatest comic book villain of all time then I would say that it's a great perspective into the twisted and suffering mind of an alienated man with emphasys on the struggle he goes through as he incapable to function in society.But that's not the case. The movie is called Joker, it's Batman's nemesis' origin story.I particularly like this character, I've admired it since the animated series I was watching growing up.I feel that this is not the real Joker, this is just a mentally ill person.The Joker does not suffer from insanity, he enjoys every moment of it."
2132,"I don't care about the controversy but Joker is 1000% self indulgent ""give me an oscar because I'm weird"" crap. I couldn't stop laughing at how bad Joaquin Phoenix was. Never thought I'd say it, but Jared Leto was better. At least he had more crime interaction and did Jokery things. This was a big baby dancing and crying for 2 hours. I couldn't believe it. The plot is also paper thin and is mostly lifted from better movies.Movie attempts to have social commentary about mental health yadda yadda and fails miserably. It's like it was written by a high schooler who just learned what psychology is and has seen Glass too many times.Currently the film is being over praised as ""brilliant"" and it's simply not. The only brilliant person on set was the director of photography, because it is an excellent looking movie.I wanted this movie to be good but it's literally just Joaquin Phoenix prancing like an idiot and being sad. It's not even that violent or visceral. The only reason to watch this is to be able to discuss why it's so horrible."
2133,"I am seriously curious, do all ppl who are rating him so good watch it? Did we watch that same crap! You are totally overtaken by the hype. No good direction, soundtracks, cinematography, decoration, costumes, plot, everything is Just out of context, all the sequences are irrational and not linked to each other.. I am totally disappointed. I waited long time and hoped alot from this movie! Total crap!"
2134,If you feel like watching a guy laughing and crying for an hour and a half then this movie is for you. It's best to wait til it gets on Blu-ray or a streaming service and then you can skip to the last half-hour because that's the only part that actually matters. This movie was pure garbage. And all the 5 star reviews must be people as mentally unstable as this Joker was supposed to be.
2135,"The acting, the story, the dialogue, the cinematography, the soundtrack, everything was true art. I would recommend this movie to anyone, it is a very violent movie but it does not deserve the harsh criticism is has received. Definitely a 10/10 breathtaking film."
2136,Perfect combination of acting and talent. Loved it most.
2137,Joker is one of the best movies out there. 8.5 is not high for this movie. It should have been at least 9. JP is fantastic. All the cast is great! The persno who made the movie what it is though is Todd. He is brilliant. From Old School to Joker? Come on. He is a genious.
2138,"Joaquin Phoenix certainly did an impressive, impeccable and magnificent job. I'm very dedicated to the role... Valla prepared himself very well and explained step by step how he managed to characterize himself in the best possible way for his role and how only great actors do: very professional. I am infinitely grateful that he has taken the time to investigate about the disorders, about the drugs, but above all for the time that he has dedicated to perfecting such an important detail as the Joker's laugh, a laugh that is so impactful and full of pain, frustration, anger and in many cases madness. A wonderful experience in the cinema for a lot with a great message, which unlike what has been said, has left me thinking about the responsibility we have in a society that instead of helping feeds violence."
2139,"The Batman comics have inspired some truly excellent movies, and this is one of the best. I have a major soft spot for movies about broken, mistreated people being driven to acts of desperation and evil, and that's exactly what Joker is. Rather than present the man as a two-dimensional villain who is bad for the sake of it, this movie takes the time to show us what kind of society breeds monsters. Arthur Fleck wasn't born bad, but a lifetime of abuse and apathy from the people who ought to be trying to help him slowly warps him into a psychopath, and he accidentally becomes the lynchpin of a rebellion against the fat cats and ivory tower elites who have kept the unprivileged classes of Gotham under their heels. It may be fiction, but Arthur's descent into madness mirrors the lives of many real serial killers and madmen - nobody just wakes up one day and decides to commit atrocities, it's a combination of untreated mental illness and an abusive environment that creates reality's boogeymen. It's hard not to feel sorry for Arthur despite the terrible things he does, and anyone who has been dealt a bad hand in life will no doubt relate to his struggle.The strength of both Todd Philips' writing/direction and Joaquin Phoenix's performance are what makes Joker such a powerful piece of filmmaking, and the haunting score by Hildur Gudnadottor is the icing on the cake. In terms of atmosphere alone, it's phenomenal, and the pacing is so tight and deliberate that every second of screen time is crucial. I dare say it's one of the finest examples of a mainstream Hollywood production in ages. The movie grossed $1 billion at the box office and scored an Oscar for Phoenix, both well deserved, and if you haven't seen it yet then I would urge you to watch it on 4K Blu-ray for maximum effect. It's a breathtaking experience and the expense is entirely warranted for a movie of this caliber. If nothing else, at least you'll be able to appreciate the finer details of the most beautifully decrepit depiction of Gotham every put to screen."
2140,"Joker is a story of what happens to a man who is beaten and given up by society and sometimes society creates monsters. I know this is a deeply character-driven story about the Joker and I believe in my heart Todd Phillips did very well. The Joker doesn't have a definite origin story but this was well executed. The score is fantastic, it's shot beautifully and Mr Phoenix gives a memorable performance for all time. Masterpiece is what I call this film 👏"
2141,"One of the best movie I have ever seen in my life, yes you get less action that in Batman movies but what it loose in action, it gains in depth. What an incredible movie about the Joker past, it give a complete different point of view to this character. Joaquin Phoenix is awesome, he deserves the Oscar."
2142,"This movie is flipping AMAZING. Helped by the fact I'm absolutely blown away in love with Joaquin Phoenix, his performance in this movie is absolutely faultless as usual, he's an absolute star. The movie is shocking in so many ways and sent my emotions sky rocketing. You feel this sense of sadness and empathy for this crazy character, Joker, learning about his traumatic past and his reasons behind evolving into 'Joker'. No wonder. He doesn't become the Joker, the Joker becomes him.
Some really crazy moments in this movie actually shocked me to the point I noticed my mouth was wide open... not only is it beautifully shot but I absolutely loved the costume design. The colours, the cut of the clothes, the makeup... absolute perfection. I honestly can't fault this movie, an absolute must see."
2143,"Masterpiece of a movie and one of the best performances of all time by Joaquin Phoenix. Great, suspenseful movie that keeps you on edge and definitely deserves all of the awards it has received."
2144,"Of all films to watch during this pandemic when a comedy would have been more feasible, but I thought, 'hey, why not!' And I was curious to learn what all the hype was regarding Joaquin's performance in this film. Now I know why! He was brilliant and more than deserving of an Oscar for his performance as Joker.This film is of a controversial nature with a bleak and disturbing storyline that centers around a psycho who is sick and eventually turns to evil. No spoiler about the Joker, most folks know the story. Joaquin Phoenix cleverly manipulates the viewer's emotions with either disgust,hatred, or empathy toward the character, Arthur/Joker. I empathized with Arthur. Some people might find the subject matter too much to handle. Be it as it may, the storyline is so engaging and flows so well that you have no choice but to watch the movie to the end. Everything made sense as to how and why the Joker came to be. Outstanding production and cast!Joaquin's got a reputation for being odd. I think part of it is an act; maybe not. I don't care. I don't need to know what he does or did behind the scenes or why he decided to do this project. All I know is this man is an extremely intense and stellar actor. I also have to applaud the entire cast ensemble who was great as well, but Joaquin stands out among them all. He put his entire being into this character showing the viewer that yes, the character, Arthur had reasons for being the tormented soul that he was, and the story shows how cruel and uncaring people can be, not to mention Arthur's mother who was sick in more ways than one, both living in Gotham City ravaged with piling garbage and big, fat rats! First there is Arthur, the clown, then enter Joker!I could think of a couple of other actors who would have done a great job in this role such as Christian Bale and even Sam Rockwell. Both are outstanding actors and right up there on my favorites list, but I'm glad this role went to Joaquin Phoenix. He excels!"
2145,"Joaquin phoenix is no doubt a great actor. This movie is basically a homage to him playing an insane person. Probably much ad-libbing. But the story itself was pretty poor. Not much in the way of setting up the making of one of Batman's arch enemies. Not very believable at all that this disjointed nut would ever be able to counter Batman someday. I think filmmaker forgot that was the point of the whole story. It's like they used the joker character to make some kind of statement about mentally unstable people, but if you made a movie called "" depression"" or "" crazy person"" no studio would fund it, and nobody would watch..very very overrated."
2146,A great movie. Joaquin Phoenix's performance was phenomenal. His performance holds up to the standard Heath Ledger left for the character of the joker. The score was good. The cinematography was very well made.
2147,"Oke, you played it nice. But the real joker is not that autistic. Even better... the joker is a master in social awarness, only he sees the darkness and cynicism in everything. You can debat if he is a social genius or a social path.Heath ledger was the master over the character The Joker, he really felt him.. he really became him. Nobody will ever surpess heath ledger with that.But I know somebody (also a actor and a comedian) that IS him in real life:
Chris D'elia.Cast Chris D'elia for the next joker....So I did not like the cast, periodAlthough he did a great job for the person he is."
2148,"Todd Phillips has a very unique approach to writing and directing a comic book flick. Instead of having a lot of typical fantasy like tropes. This motion picture went for the more ground crime drama character study story with DC Comics Batman's arch nemesis 'The Joker'. Something that a lot of fans kinda wanted. After all, while a number of backstories have been given in the comics, a definitive one has not yet been established for the clown prince of crime. However, fans of the psychopath criminal mastermind version of him will probably not like this movie. This form has him as a somewhat mentally disable impoverished depress comedian Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) whose descent closer into insanity and nihilism when disregarded by society in a decaying Gotham City during 1981. Let's face it. The character is far cry departure from the versions we got in previous movies. He's less a villain and more like an antihero in this film. Arthur just wants people to be happy. Losing 52 pounds, Joaquin does portray the naïve starving artist well. The scenes where his rib cage is visual are quite upsetting. The way Phoenix walks up the stairs with his shoulder slumped down show how downtrodden Arthur really is. Great use of body language. The facial expressions including the makeup run offs that Joaquin does are also well perform. Whenever Arthur's condition caused him to uncontrollably laugh. His mouth opens way too wide that it looks distressing. On several occasions they are indistinguishable from his sobbing. It really illustrated Arthur's declining mental state. However, the film is so heavily influence by Martin Scorsese's 1976 movie 'Taxi Driver' & 1982 'King of Comedy' that many of this film scenes felt like clichés reenactments like the fake out shot me sign moment involving love interest Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz). Another bothersome I got was due to the character's chronic daydreaming, it makes the audience question just how much of the film, we see is happening in real time and how much of it is Arthur's fantasizing. Because of that the movie has a lot of deliberately somewhat annoying open-ended plot holes. For example, how he was able to get away with so many murders. Killing a patient at the hospital without setting off the alarm on the heart monitor machine and even being allowed in the building after an infamous previous gun accident seem unlikely. That or the cops really slow to arrested people. After all Arthur has plenty of time to sleep, get dress, eat and murder a coworker after breaking in a neighbor's room. The logic in these scenes are a bit annoying as the entire ending plays like a deranged hallucination rather than a genuine series of events. The whole idea of the Wayne family seeing a movie during the riots seem a bit forced. In truth I don't think the film never really figured out a true decent climax. That's why I believe when Arthur told the psychiatrist that she wouldn't get the joke. I think the whole story might have been made up, in order to troll the whole audience to feel sympathy for him and his crimes. Whether Arthur becomes the actual Joker as seen in traditional Batman lore or inspires a separate character is ambiguous. Either way, Arthur will be an old man by the time Batman is established. Regardless the film is a little too heavy handed and preachy when it comes to dealing with people with mental health. After all, none of the supporting characters Arthur hurts really deserve their punishment besides the three oddly seem out of place rich guys on the train. None of them are fully evil to be sympathetic. Some of them honestly are friendly and help Arthur more than they harm such as giving him protection and a chance to redeem himself on television when they could had run away. As of Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) he gave Arthur the truth about his origin even after what the unstable man did to him. Although how much of a jerk he is left up to the viewer's interpretation of what Arthur's origins truly was. With that it's really hard to believe that Fleck would repress the abusive memories of his past for that long. Still I do dig the theories involving that. I just wish the film had more comic book references rather than the small mentions. As for shouts out to other media. The best use has to be Charlie Chaplin's 1936's film 'Modern Times'. Not only is the movie's footage visual in the movie, but the cover of ""Smile"" is haunting along with Stephen Sondheim's 'Send in the Clowns' song. I like that the music is generally discordant, unsettling and tonally dissonant. It reflects Arthur's feverish mental state so well. The sequence involving dancing on the stairs is so iconic. I really like how the sets & locations looks. It's an urban nightmare. No wonder why Arthur went crazy. As for the controversy surrounding the film revolves around being sympathetic towards killers & this movie might inspiring copycats. I understand why. It wasn't even shown in certain parts of Colorado due to the 2012 Aurora shooting. Many police forces and even the US Army were also put on alert when this flick was released in theaters. In the end, the film still got the last laugh as it made a ton of money. However, Warner Bros did make a movie that push buttons with its themes in class warfare and gun control that I doubt a sequel would be made. They don't even considered part of the DC Extended Universe. Instead, it is an Else worlds story. In the end, while entertaining & thought provoking at certain parts. It's still a disturbing film. The film presents no solutions, promotes despair and really is a glorification of violence. Just know that when seeing this movie. It's one film that certainly not to have a happy ending."
2149,Was an ok film. I don't like any comic book films really so I am biased in that way. I guess it gets such high reviews because of all the biased comic book fans. Also when Bruce Wayne grows up to be Batman how old would the Joker be??
2150,This movie was hard to follow. It was all over the place.
2151,This movie was made by people who know what they are doing. It's a fantastic drama that makes you consider your views of reality while also being incredibly entertaining. Highly recommend.
2152,"Phoenix 100% deserves his Oscar because he sold the movie. No other actor could have made the mediocre plot into a somewhat decent piece of work. The climax was definitely unexpected. This version of the Joker is more believable than Ledger's but Ledger's is just overall more unhinged, terrifying, and mesmerizing. Back to Joaquin. I don't know how someone so consistently shines in every role they're cast as. I watched this movie three times, and each time you notice small ticks and sporadic actions Joaquin inserted into the scenes to create an indelible mark on the character by the end of the movie we come to call the Joker."
2153,"I liked Joker. JP was great fun to watch, and the atmosphere is great. It establishes a tone and sticks to it all the way through. It builds tension and has good payoffs. It's the kind of movie that I could walk into at any point and be drawn in to want to finish viewing. I hope they go through with a sequel. Normally, I wouldn't say that, but this movie just begs for it."
2154,"Joker is a powerful social critique of our perception towards mental health (how would we react if someone started laughing uncontrollably in the street?), but it can also be seen as an absurdist perspective on free will. Arthur's fatal flaw is not the hubris of Odysseus, or the ambition like Macbeth, but the simple and relatable need to discover why he was born, and for others to notice his existence. He achieves both of these things in the film, but the symbolic death of ""Arthur"" with the killing of his mother and rebirth of the comedic ""Joker"", occurs from a catalytic reaction with society, rather than as an agent of his own destiny.In philosophy, ""the Absurd"" refers to the conflict between the human tendency to seek inherent value and meaning in life, and the human inability to find any in a purposeless, meaningless or chaotic and irrational universe. In the film, this conflict reaches its culmination when Arthur embraces his involuntary laughter as his real self, and finally understands the ""joke"". Life itself. It's a joke for absurdists. As he says in the film, comedy is subjective.When he accepts who he is, he is finally seen by others, and becomes a symbol of chaos and anarchy in a grotesque parody of the superhero. But crucially, this is not something he chooses to become, it's something he is forced into becoming because of his genetics, his environment, and his mother. Arthur ultimately sees life as a comedy - as absurd - because he loses belief in free will. And that actually makes him a classic tragic figure. Arthur wanted to bring laughter and happiness into the world, but was always going to be the killer called the Joker."
2155,"When you hear the joker- your thinking wild killings, crazy music, wild women.... At least I did. It's nothing like that. It's more from his mental illness standpoint. It's more of a sad movie, really."
2156,"Just watched this last night, succumbing to all the incredible press that's been surrounding the film lately, and I have to say, I was a bit underwhelmed.First off, does no one remember THE DARK KNIGHT (2008) and Heath Ledger's legendary turn as Joker? Did we really need yet another take on who Batman's arch nemesis is? Although he was quite amazing in an extreme and dedicated performance, I never really felt like I wasn't watching Joaquin Phoenix do some really good acting, vs. seeing the character of Joker emerge from the tortured individual of Arthur Fleck. Yes, his character changed and grew throughout the film, but it was always Joaquin Phoenix I felt like I was watching. Ledger's immersive performance made me forget the actor entirely, seeing only the insane character of Joker throughout. Personally, I feel like I would've responded better had this movie been something other than an origin story, where Phoenix's portrayal would've been able to expand upon Joker's character (perhaps w/flashbacks to his origin). In this way, the established standard presented by Ledger could have been built upon - and even morphed into further (and greater) complexity - rather than feeing like a different take on the same character. Which gets me to my second point...In my view, one of the main problems with the DC universe that Marvel has overcome is the constant need to reinvent itself, rather than build upon an established world that continues to expand through character and story (yeah, I know they're trying - but it ain't workin'). Although a completely new take, with no ties to the existing DC cinematic universe and no intention of further exploration via sequels, JOKER feels like an attempt at making something remarkable that's kinda sorta part of the DC cinematic universe (no, really it's not), but kinda sorta misses the mark. The entire film has a look-at-how-incredible-and- different-I-am vibe that I just could not shake. And, yes, in some ways JOKER is incredible and different. But it's not currently tied to any other part of the DC cinematic universe, nor is it intended to be. So, as a standalone venture, the film becomes nothing more than a harsh, gritty, depressing throwback to other great films like TAXI DRIVER or THE KING OF COMEDY (which might explain why Robert De Niro finds himself in a throwaway role in this film).Lastly... The depiction and use of excessive and gratuitous violence in this day and age, for me, demonstrates an inability to avoid old and tired tropes in favor of more unnerving approaches to filmmaking that isn't so much ""in your face"" with longer lasting effects. Let's be honest: societally, we're so aware of and numbed by the depiction of gun violence on the screen that it has absolutely no punch anymore for most people. Hence the feeling of gratuitousness it brings when seeing it, once again, depicted in all it's violent glory. Joker is a character who, at a minimum, is a master agent of chaos, and this film almost gets that - but not quite. Instead, the focus goes more toward the flashy extravagance of the violence, which screams so loudly at us from the screen that we only catch a glimpse of the character's deeper motives (and satisfaction at achieving them) by the end of the film.Is JOKER a bad film that should be avoided at all cost? No - far from it. But this viewer honestly does not understand why it's garnered all the incredible buzz it's been receiving of late. JOKER is simply another decent film that could've been so much more than it is."
2157,Great movie and Oscar nomination performance by Joaquin Phoenix
2158,"J. Phoenix is incredible.
What an amazing actor.
I went into this only being aware it was about Jokers' life.
Completely blew my mind, the emotional depth & complexity of the character Joker, by J. Phoenix. The man is a master actor.
Everyone who has ever felt ignored, poor, down trodden, disrespected, low class, menial, nothing, insignificant, outcast, worthless.... this is a must see film for you.
It is not a bright, happy, happy joy joy film. It is an engrossing film with much emotional depth, pain & irreverence.
I had no idea such films, about such characters, could even be made. Amazing, quite amazing.
Thank you to the makers & to J. Phoenix. Mr. Phoenix, you Sir, have truly created the Joker. I hope there are more films with you, about him. They really need to be of the same calibre please.Incredible. Thank you so much.
It also speaks to today, what is happening in our world, the great financial divide....100/10 A definite must see!!!!"
2159,"Joaquin Phoenix was PERFECT, what an actor. I wasn't sure how I would like this movie being a fan of Jack Nicholson's Joker and Heath Ledger's Joker. But Phoenix's Joker was the very best by far, he is an excellent actor and nailed the crazyness and sadness of the character. I do feel he was cheated out of the Oscar for his acting in Gladiator which in my opinion he stole the movie! Watch for him to win the Oscar for this portrayal! Loved it."
2160,Was it real was it not? Probably not as too many indicators refer to It all being in his head which if true makes it one big huge disappointment of a film. But then why would you change your hero (Murray) into a bad guy.... And why imagine your mother is a monster. Is this person even the real joker? Who knows who cares. 5 stars for the excellent acting.
2161,From the acting to directing ... I'm stunned. An instant classic. Incredible movie.
2162,"I liked the acting but the story was slow and took a while to progress, it feels more like an art movie version of the joker than the traditional depictions of the character."
2163,"Prepare to be moved, this is an intense look at the demise of a mentally ill man in a society offering little support. Phoenix is outstanding- he must surely get the best actor Oscar for this performance. This is my new best film of all time, knocking The Usual Suspects off its 20+ year throne."
2164,After long time watch good movie nice performance by actor
2165,"Fitst I would like to say that I'm not a fan of DC universe. But watched this film out of curiosity.
Now I became a big fan of 'joker' character and this actor. Damn!! This film is so good.
Single person handled the whole movie. 👏
He lived with this character. His emotions, facial expressions and dialogues are feel so lively.
To Oscar committee- Please give this man what he deserves. You must give the award to him for his outstanding performance. Don't waste your award on anyone else.
Must watch film everyone. You wont regret it. Watch it!!"
2166,"Ugh, another Batman/Joker story... seems like they keep alternating those with Superman reboots. I was never a fan to start with (Marvel comics > DC) but after so many movie/tv/cartoon iterations of the tale, I really didn't care about this movie.
Still, considering the raving reviews I had to check it out, and am I glad I did!
From the writing to the cinematography and formidable performance by Joaquin Phoenix this is a fantastic movie, even without the Batman/Joker context.
If this movie came out years before this franchise's fatigue it would have blown everybody's mind (mine included). Believe the hype and go watch it, you won't regret it!"
2167,"I saw that this film was highly rated and reviewed and I thought it would be a good movie, but I've been a victim of the ""Superhero genre ratings boost"" before. This movie was absolutely spectacular! The story, the acting, the dialogue, the angles, the score... Joaquin Phoenix was the star and his performance was legendary, but there was no bad acting. All the characters were very believable in their facial expressions, voice intonation, and personality. Of course the movie was disturbing, but it was obviously meant to be. It makes us think about society and what it would be like exist in it if your brain did not function ""normally"". If you are someone who suffers from ""triggers"" be careful, there are some moments that will mess with everyone's head."
2168,"How I've seen films which I've hated but everybody else has loved and vice versa. I don't know how people can give this film anything below a 9, I was gripped from start to finish and you have to see that The Joker in dark Knight etc must have been mentally ill. This film goes a long way to show how and why. I loved it."
2169,"I loved this movie it was sad, dark, a little unnerving some funny scenes but not comedic if you know what I mean. I wanted to walk away after the first few minutes of watching, so believable. The cast was great. I totally understand how the character grew to be who he was according to The Batman Series, and how he became a villain, awesome acting, great cast, I gave it a10 because, the actor who plays The Joker deserves that alone !!!!"
2170,"Everything about this film is just superb. The atmosphere, the photography, the pace and story itself but last and certainly not least Joaquin Phoenix.
His performance is mesmerising and amazing. His body, thin and contorted, his face, his eyes... Although he's acting it never feels fake and every inch of his body is telling the story. It could almost be a silent movie and you would still get it.
It is an origins film but it could easily stand on it's own as the close up story of a man's descent into madness.
It is haunting and a masterpiece."
2171,"Excellent movie to watch, Joaquin Phoenix's acting is phenomenal."
2172,"There's something I just absolutely LOVE about this movie. It totally flips the hero/villain genre on its head. Where do villains come from? Who is the real source of evil? Urban criminals? The destitute? Those envious of the ""success"" of the ""wealthy""? Those ""unwilling"" to ""work hard"" to ""the top""? Or those in power who hoard most of the money and serve corporations before communities/individuals? Those who know how to manipulate the masses, sitting behind desks getting paid an absurdly disproportionate salary while everyone else is discardable and does all the hard work for the least pay.What if those we would vilify are simply products of a broken system? Is there some wisdom in our dark sides? I don't know about you, but this refreshing narrative seems a helluva lot more convincing than anything taught to our children about the nature of ""good"" and ""evil"", ""us"" and ""them"", and the idea that wealth, freedom and happiness is remotely within reach of anyone who has a selfless heart. Yet there's an irony in those who hoard all the money in calling others selfish, in making sure that this capitalistic narrative perpetuates into the next generation.Perhaps all the superhero stories have had it wrong all this time, who the real hero is, and who the real villain is. I love this exploration of our (cultural) shadow."
2173,"I would say that I agree with most, but not because I conform with the masses but because I enjoy an amazing movie that shows the depths of the actors/actor of the movie! Joaquin did an amazing job of characterizing what we always needed to know about Joker! We know Joker as the ""villain,"" but do we know why or how he became a villain or the bad guy? I enjoyed the movie so much that it made me happy! ""Don't forget, that's life!"""
2174,Joaquin Phoenix should win the next Oscar for this and all other awards .... He is mind blowing in every way as Joker. And if he does not win the Oscar for this role I do not know who would deserve it more then him??
2175,I think this is a fantastic film. I like their take on the Joker origin. i would recommend this to all geeks out there. The most iconic villain in his own movie. No Batman to steal Joker's spotlight
2176,"I'm 39 years old but kind of wish I was still in college so I could dedicate a very long paper to this movie and get an A+. Not because I'm that good of a writer, but more because the prescient themes in this movie have my brain working over time and I'm inspired to put pen to paper. This is a movie that will make you think. It's not formulaic in that cheesy Hollywood way. The villain isn't all bad the heroes are flawed if there are any. Our society is sick and this movie in the most artful way exposes the disease. The word that keeps coming to my mind is irreverent. Comedians are irreverent. What has working hard and playing by the rules netted most Americans??? Yet the media loves that story and comedians poke fun and could give a flying you know what"
2177,"A movie which corresponds to loneliness, depression of this generation, where many of us face rejection in our day to day life.
You can enjoy this dark cinema only if you are going through a dark patch of your life too or have been. You can get totaly obsessed by this character.
Dialogues are so strong that they keeps playing in your mind."
2178,"Indictment of the American dream and healthcare system ..
it truly is creating desperate people.
i am amazed that this movie is made.
it would make more money following the classical road.it is a absolute masterpiece,and i hope it will receive a lot of rewards, for taking this brave stand.
its says my review is to short to post so. wow"
2179,"Coherent storytelling that definitely improves upon second viewing. The acting was incredible, beautiful cinematography and I would go as far to say that the script was flawless. An absolute must see."
2180,"That's one the best movie I've ever seen in my whole life, The story incredible and unbelievable while you watch that kind of movie you don't what happened in the next situation, in fact you can enjoy and a complex feeling."
2181,"I don't see anyone else topping what Joaquin Phoenix did to this movie. A masterclass performance from one of the best actors in the world past and present. This is the best Joker performance so far. A movie I will watch again and again as I did with walk the line because of this amazing actor that makes you believe everything is real, its impossible to take your eyes of the screen."
2182,"I don't know what you call this, but it's not a movie. This is like.. biblical. It's like hearing a pastor preach about bible stories and then one day, God shows up and reveals what actually, and really happened, and it blows your mind away on levels you never before imagined. That's what this is. It is revealing and I'm not sure why the Director / Producers would do what they have done here, with this Masterpiece. They have laid strokes NO ONE can follow today. They will have to watch what they eat, what they drink, where they go, 24/365 security for them now. They have done this to themselves because envy is a hell of a thing. Congratulations on a film so well done, in my opinion, it is unmatched. The only ones that comes close is Amadeus and The Matrix."
2183,"As a watcher never seen DC or other super heroes series before, this movie hooked me. The writer and director are must be genius. Love this movie, love the actor, bless u guys."
2184,"Very very very good, at first i was counting with another reinvented history of a villain that will not match to a another batman movie. Not only does it continue a new movie, it also gives a new perspective to a new, crazier, more psychopath batman movie, without those cgi things. And another thing, Joaquin Phoenix didn't look at first look like a possible Joker, but i was totally wrong, he was the best and Heathen Ledger would be proud. This performance is for a oscar."
2185,"Joker is one of the best movie i've seen in 2019. The acting of Joaquin Phoenix is top class and of next level. He steals the show. He has buried himself deeper into the character. So much that it looks even more real than the Joker itself(Lmao, but serious ly). This movie also rasies a question that should rebel be considered as a crime?Watch this masterpiece at least once in your life. It will surely change your view on a hero and a villian. A villan is not born bad but the environment he is raised in makes him do so...."
2186,"This was among the top 5 movies I've ever seen. I found joaquins performance both entertaining and disturbing. On the one hand, you're laughing at his social ineptitude, saying ""oh that joker, always trying to fit in"" but as the plot unfolds, you find yourself picking your jaw up off the ground. And the camera work, it just accents his amazing performance. Someone said this movie spiraled from start to finish and they were not kidding. If he doesn't win the Oscar for this, then the academy is a waste of time."
2187,"The joker is real amazing, real greatest movie!!! Just great!!!"
2188,Joker portrayed the slow decent into madness in a phenomenal way. This was more than a DC movie- it was a psychological rabbit hole.There were so many moments of deep cringe- it was almost too much to endure. But that's exactly why it was such an extraordinary film.Movies often glaze over and glamorize insanity. This movie highlights the uncomfortable and disturbing moments that others don't touch.
2189,"Joaquin simply amazing i olved him because of Her movie
But this one
It's masterpiece"
2190,"All I loved about this movie was because of Joaquin. He did an amazing work, he collaborated to the ambience.
This movie reflects a very sympathetic Joker wherw put you as a viewer between the debate of feeling bad for him or not, the cruel and dark scenes are very entertaining and kept me with my mouth wide open the entire film. I liked it a lot."
2191,"I just want to say that this movie proved that without cgi , childish action scenes and a very big budget there can be a masterpiece .I was grasped from start to end by the Joaquin Phoenix's acting ,the dark theme ,screenplay, songs collection and timing ,direction ,and last but not the least the dancing . I was amazed to see critics claiming this movie dangerous ,after seeing this movie i learned to be kinder to mentally disturb people .Maybe critics should stop seeing us viewers as dumb objects"
2192,"I do consider myself a bit of a snob(thanks dad) when it comes to what I believe to be great cinema ,don't get me started on what I believe it is.
Fellini,Tarkovsky,Antanioni, Zulawski,Lynch,Fincher,Villeneuve,Nolan and (now Todd Phillips) and it'll take me a long time to list them all but I have to say I was truly shocked by this movie,it's brilliant,in every aspect- rhythm,camera movement,colour composition,music,acting,sheer madness,message,Phoenix FFS.
I'm truly lost for words of how much of a mind blowing experience it was!
I love you Heath Ledger but I know for sure you'd be so proud and freeeking happy of what Joaquin's done with role of Joker if you'd still be around silly billy!"
2193,Amazing film and acting was superb. Could not have been better.
2194,"Hello,Firstly, I would like to say I create for the very first time an account here. And this is my first review after watching the movie. Sincerely, this is the best best movie of the year, and may be of the century.Some time ago, when the movie about Queen came out, my opinion was the same, and not long after, the film won almost all the Oscars.Best,"
2195,"I can't tell how I felt with every sense I watched,it was like take green cart to get in our deep side, and show us what is there! Jouqen is the most actor did his role in perfect way all the time. I watched movie twice before, and I'm waiting to watch it again"
2196,"There isn't that much I want to say about the film. Actually I have only one word for you: Gorgeous!
The movie explains what is so wrong with the society and it documents how a poor, lost man named Arthur became a serial killer: The Joker
It's a Must-See for everybody!"
2197,"Holy smokes!!!! For the first time I see a movie where someone considered a vilain
actually is the matyr of the movie. Joaquin totally bleeds out this role, captures the whole drama in a very magnificient way, i totally love this movie brilliant and massive achievment of the reboot of this character in the Batman sequel, scintilating performance,the hate, reject,mockery, lack culminates up an impecable experience and totally thrilling drama. This transcends most of drama I have seen,Frankly i thought I too thought it was a hype but after watchx this piece i say it deserves all the credit."
2198,"Make no mistake, this is not a supervillan superhero movie. It's a powerful introspection about all of us sad clowns, dysfunctionally coping with life by putting on a happy face and not being so serious about the things we encounter.Phoenix realistically embodied the descend of a broken man into the darkness of insanity, a deep inner place where all societal norms get reformulated and endless second chances are born. Radical ideas like these can easily be interpreted as grandious avantgarde visions, and mobilize cultish fanatical followers - just as many Jokers thruought our history have demonstrated.Although it is commonly believed that the ""freaks"" come out at night when society falls asleep, we should ask ourselves who the real freaks of this world are - just like Travis Bickle did at the end of Taxi Driver."
2199,"Its been a long time since ive seen such a cinematic masterclass. Maybe even the best ive seen?
I was always a big nut on the 90's Batman movies, the older cartoons and such. This movie however stands on its own.Now let me know whats not grand about this flick.
The pace, story, style, vibe, mood, script, art style, camera work, lighting, actors, directors are as good as it gets here.Then theres the political aspects. Is he a hero or a villain. I guess empathy cuts both sides of the importance of this movie in the 21st century.Watch this movie with attention and submission.
The payout is rewarding as it is entertaining.
We all have a bit of a joker inside of us if you like it or not.That's life..."
2200,"Best movie created in a long long time. It gives chills and shivers. Capturing character development. It left hunger for more of this character. Truly worthy Jocker performance, does not bring shame to legendary Ledger's performance. Loved every lovely, scary, uncomfortable, sad second of the movie. Worth all of the awards this year."
2201,"The Joker is as breathtaking as ever under Todd Phillips' command. Follow the tragic untold story that begins with a mentally ill comedian who has an unsettling medical condition that makes him suffer from pathological laughter. Embark on this twisted voyage and prepare to be changed forever when you enter a world of misery, disdain and progressive human degradation.This psychological thriller depicts Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) struggling to be accepted by a callous society while working as a clown in the freezing cold streets and enduring horrid beatings to keep his job. The only gateway to optimism which helps him maintain his sanity is his lifelong dream and ambition to become a professional comedian. Motivated by the lack of humanity in those around him, he takes a radical turn and joins a dark path that later leads him to becoming the Joker. As from that moment, he can but witness his life being shattered in front of him.Director Todd Phillips, who's best known for his contribution to the comedic side of the cinema with productions like 'The Hangover' trilogy, does a 180 degree turn diving deep into a universe defined by chaos and crime. His latest film is by far the most complex he has ever been involved in. He has previously stated during multiple interviews that the film is not connected to the DCEU and the lack of any other DC comics' characters- besides a young Batman- was probably one of the cleverest ideas for the plot. Doing so, the film gains a certain gravity that is beneficial for the character and is best suited if the Joker is in some way 'separated' from the others.A true piece of art, ""Joker"" is not a typical comic book origin story. It brings so much to the table, paving a new path for future DC adaptations of such accuracy and importance. With a script as unpredictable as its protagonist, it makes it very difficult for audiences to disapprove of Phillips' signature style of co-writing and directing. His work of great precision is centered around essential little details regarding Arthur's life and hidden origins. Phillips will most definitely take centre stage at the Academy Awards this year considering the magnitude of his latest project.
Joaquin Phoenix will take the Oscars by storm, thanks to his brave portrayal that is magnificent, as well as oddly exhilarating. Despite being regarded as a bold choice for the part by some, Phoenix gives one of the most refreshing performances of the decade, adding an exciting new edge to the character- sensitivity. Watching him go through pain, loneliness and sorrow triggers emotions of considerable depth that undeniably affect each member of the audience.As soon as he steps into character, his uniqueness is complimented by the original score and cold-toned cinematography. A vintage set reminiscent of ""Taxi Driver"", an eerie soundtrack composed by Hildur Guðnadóttir and an epic script put together by a true perfectionist are just a few of the distinctive features of the film. Without a doubt the strongest contender for this year's Academy Award statuette, ""Joker"" tells the disturbing story of a lonely man who lost all his hope while unsuccessfully attempting to fit in a hostile society."
2202,"It makes you feel like you could have gone down the wrong path and empathize with him. There are a ton of would be jokers out there who have been tormented day in and day out, and now you see what happens when one of them has had enough. I used to think Joker was a psychopath. Hardly! He's simply a mentally ill (borderline personality disorder and schizophrenic ) person pushed to the edge. This could almost serve as a foretelling of what could truly happen if we don't try to help people now, who go through this kind of abuse."
2203,"Best Orgin Movie u can never ever seen in your life. JACQOUIN PHEONIX.. Acting is a piece of ART!!!... Masterpiece by DC
Watch it. Dont Miss it"
2204,"A good movie if you want to watch go!! The acting is great, the story is grateful. And Joker is The Movie of 2019 Overall."
2205,"If you're here for a joker story this is not for you. It's a character development movie. The trailer tells you exactly what the movie is about. It's a bout Arthur Fleck becoming the joker. But that's not why it's great. It's great because Hawken Phoenix shows you how a person changes. Everything is rooted in reality and everything that happens is very beliveable not because what is actually happening is believeable but because Arthur believes it to be. This is a great movie that can be interperated to eternity. Director Todd Phillips really went for gold here. He created an amazing universe which this movie can exist in. You don't know if any of the things that happens really happened or if it's just in Arthur's head. Damn everyone should se this movie. I've seen it 3 times in cinema, but I want to see it again. It's just that good. It's art in its truest form."
2206,"Wow, just WOW!Mindblowing performance by Joaquin Phoenix! Mindblowing movie!Nothing more to add."
2207,"Probably the most intense film I've watched but maybe for personal reasons.
This film goes deep and can be quite uncomfortable.
The acting is sublime and the cinematography is beautiful but basic.
This film has left an everlasting mark on me, more than any film I've watched before, in good and bad ways.
It'll be a while before I feel comfortable to watch it again (but I will)Some of the low scoring reviews on here are hilarious and look like they're written by 5 year old who'd expected to an Avengers movie.
This film is massively thought provoking and is an absolute must for fans of cinema.Outstandingly edgy without being pretentious."
2208,"As a kid growing up Joker was my favorite superhero villain and I always enjoyed seeing the different ways he was portrayed as. That being said, nothing tops this film. Phoenix gives one of the best performances of any film I have ever seen in my life. The writing is absolutely enchanting, dark, tight and extremely engaging. This movie blends psychological thriller, with crime mystery, and overall dark drama. The original score is about as perfectly made for a film as it can possibly get. Whenever it came on I notice the effect of the slow burn increasing suspense my heart rate would increase. The pacing in this movie is just fantastic, it flys by so quickly. I am still taking everything in, the symbolic elements, the meaning of it all and the ending especially the ending which is worth the price of admission. Joker is an extremely dark, and emotionally intense film that really is a lot to take in but it is so well done. Masterpiece!!!! Oscars make sure you watch this film and give it the awards it deserves!!!"
2209,"When I went to the theatre to see this movie, I was expecting an ordinary movie about a DC villian. But what I saw was way, way more than that. Not only does it show Joker's origin but also shows how society treats people who are a bit different from them. Todd Phillips did an amazing job presenting the little details that show Aurther Fleck's degrading mentality. And the way the music and camera shots emphasises that idea is nothing short of remarkable. Joaquin Phoenix delivered an oscar-winning performance, which made the movie something I will remember for the rest of my life."
2210,"With its very important message, beautiful cinematography, great screenplay & direction, chilling score, and an amazing actor portraying an iconic comic book villain, Joker (2019) succeeds in being one of the best movies of the decade, a masterpiece. This film even surpassed my expectations (and I had a very high expectations to begin with!). Joaquin Phoenix deserves a freaking OSCAR for this bone-chilling performance and kudos to Todd Philips for creating a dark, disturbing film that is effective for it tackles important messages about society, mental health, and the government. An instant classic."
2211,This movie is not like any other. It is truly an achievement. One of the best films I've ever seen. I too was wary of the hype and was never even really that into the Dark Knight. I'm a movie snob. This movie is something unique and terrifying and one of the best films of this decade.
2212,"It might bring something new to the table for someone who haven't seen taxi driver or Andy kauffman, but seeing them reenacted within a superhero franchise didn't do much for me."
2213,"To be 100% honest with you guys, I'm writing a review about it right now in the movie theater, right after the movie. And all I can say is that I do not know what to say. And the only question in my mind right now is ""Is this just as good as the Dark Knight, or The Godfather I and II?
Probably not, but it's extremely close. This movie is a great example of how a plot can be so simple, yet so brilliantly done at the same time. The actors, the intense score, and it brings a huge message to today's society by telling us what these so called ""celebrities"" and ""tolerant"" people think of us. The answer is NOTHING. And this is one of many reasons as to why some people go crazy and have their own lives destroyed for other people's entertainment. This movie also does a very good job by showing both sides of the story. The side of the rich, and the side of the poor. You can feel like you are in their shoes and that may be the biggest reason as to why this film is so great. It's realistic and relatable to anyone that has been in this situation. All I can say is, just go watch it in the theaters, and feel the movie for yourself. 98/100, so pretty much flawless.
FYI, for me the only flawless movie ever made is The Godfather I."
2214,This movie grabs your neck from the very beginning and chokes you for 2 hours without letting you go.To me it was a fresh breath of air in 2019.
2215,Phoenix's acting coupled with the director's great job makes us feel and understand the life of this character.
2216,"One of the best movie I have ever watched. It is like a poem. Lots of messages you will get from this movie, and you cannot be sure which message meant to be delivered. You will be always thrilled with the story and the incredible act from the joker."
2217,"I had quite high expectations regarding this film and was not disappointed one bit when I got a chance to watch it.Phoenix is brilliant, so is the film's score and overall Scorsese-sque tone. This is not a superhero (or rather villain) film, nor your usual antihero flick. It's a deeper look into what could happen to a person when they feel they don't belong."
2218,No words to describe this movie. The door handle scene will never be forgotten😂
2219,"I thought the pacing of the film was a bit slow to begin with- that was until i finished the movie and realised how wonderful and necessary it was.Finally not an over dramatisation of the Joker, showing the progression of insanity as human as possible.Tied beautifully into the Bruce Wayne story without making him the central point.And the ending was captivating and kept me in a trance like state, I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. I honestly was smiling like a maniac as the final scenes unfolded because it was perfect and long overdue after going through the mental battle with the Joker.I can see how some can dislike it, but coming from a Marvel fan, this is one of the best movies i've ever watched and DC villains always go above and beyond Marvel ones."
2220,"I was a bit of a clown coming in to watch this film on the big screen this weekend - I was not aware it had anything to do with the Batman comic hero story. I did kind of acknowledge the references to Gotham city and the Wayne family however I was so TOTALLY engrossed by the character development I actually banished these references from my mind after a few seconds (somehow not relevant). That fact alone says everything about the breathtaking intensity of this film since I do know about the Batman films and really enjoyed the Dark Knight trilogy (especially with HL as Joker). My brother could hardly believe I was not aware of the Batman storyline.
In my opinion the film does not even need to be linked to the Batman storyline. It is in itself a brilliant and poignant portrayal of a disturbed member of society falling victim to their own, and societies, failings. Perhaps I should be happy that I was so ignorant as I may not have been quite as awestruck by the performance, cinematography and soundtrack if I had known beforehand about this film's comic book origins. This was frighteningly real.I cannot, in all honestly, give a 10 out of 10 to any film (what is perfection?) but this has to be one of the best films I have ever seen and it has had a deep, disturbing impact that will certainly alter my perception of mental health issues and how we need to take care as a society."
2221,"Okay so it is a bit sad I suppose that I saw this three times in one long weekend but I just had to be sure I Loved it as much as I thought I did after the first viewing!The first time through, I cried. I literally cried from start to finish: from the haunting way in which Fleck forces himself to smile at the start (but can't stop the tears from spilling out of himself), to the end, where he has unwittingly become a hero to Gotham's suffering masses and paints the smile on his face with blood.Phoenix's performance is so raw and gritty and painful, you are compelled to watch even when you want to turn your head from the screen! And there were a few times that I wanted to do that!The second viewing? I was able to watch it without the blurry vision induced by my tears and by the third, I cried at various places and with different motivations from my original emotional response.This film is not what you might expect from an origin movie - and it is so good because of that perhaps. I am a huge comic book hero and villain fan and this was simply beautiful. And by the end, yes, you are aligned to Arthur somewhat, and you can't and don't blame him for any of the chain of events. Wonderful cinema."
2222,"It's a masterpiece
Must watch movie before dying
This movie is mirror to reality"
2223,This is one of the best movies I've seen in years. I rarely rate movies but it's just so good that I want to be sure to document that. He better get an Oscar for this performance!!
2224,"This movie felt...different. it felt truly as if I were watching a movie that was very unique. Loved every bit of this movie. The cinematography, score, dialogue and etc was great. Joaquin was excellent. If he doesn't win an oscar, the academy is a joke. He deserves it for sure. This movie shows a great way of how someone mentally unstable was affected by the world that he was surrounded by. This movie in no way tried to justify what he did. The only scene you could say that maybe tried to justify him was the ending from how everyone was cheering him on, but they weren't good people clearly as they were burning down the city and causing travesty. Anyways, great movie, a must see for sure!"
2225,Amazingly good lead performance by Joaquin Phoenix
2226,I Think Everything Was Awesome But The Acting Of Joaquin Was Incredible
2227,I don't see why people find this movie dark and cynical. I honestly don't find it the most depressing movie to watch particularly because it is reflective of many aspects of our lives that are far worse. The movie is all about Joaquin Phoenix and how brilliant he acts. Overall one of the best movies I have ever seen.
2228,"The performance of joaquin phoenix is a masterpiece. If he doesn't get an oscar for this than I don't know wat is oscar worthy. You would't expect this from Todd Phillips, but he made a masterpiece."
2229,"While I usually find the argument ""Don't listen to the critics"" childish, I will make an exception for this movie. It's FAR from the violence inciting slop the media is painting it as. Joker is a near masterpiece that, while definitely borrowing elements from other films like Taxi Driver, stands on its own as a fantastic film. Joaquin Pheonix does an incredible job and delivers one of his greatest performances as Arthur Fleck/The Joker. Pheonix really makes you feel sympathy for Arthur even if the things that he does are morally wrong and not defendable in the slightest. If you wanted a comic-book film that was more grounded in realism and 100x grittier than The Dark Knight trilogy, then this might be the movie you've always dreamed of. But the brutal violence and disturbing nature of the film is so masterfully done that it can't be dismissed as ""disgusting"" or bad because the movie is simply doing it's job well. It didn't exactly get me emotional, but it was very hard-hitting at times and some scenes had me on the edge of my seat. I think if it was a tad more original in some areas then it would be a damn near masterpiece, but overall, Joker is an amazing film that should definitely be seen at least once."
2230,Unbelievable how come we love the bad guy after living their own life
2231,I actually really didn't want to like this film and thought I was going to find it awful to watch. Instead I found it to be brilliant. So deeply disturbing and had me on totally gripped throughout. Amazing film and so well done. I usually don't like Phoenix but he is so good in this and really gets it bang on. Thanks for making this film!
2232,"I havent been this satisfied by a movie in a long time. There was so much depth and relatability. Joaquin did a fantastic job portraying such a real, broken character"
2233,"Everyone should watch this one, because in my perspective of view is the best movie in the last 5 years. Joaquin Phoenix did his best perfomance and created his own incredible Joker. In addition, you can find many aspects that involves our social life, and this aspect is very important for us, because we have the chance to see and in the sequence, discuss about the subject and how deep is this masterpiece."
2234,Saw it on opening day in Sweden and loved all of it.
2235,"I've never been a Joaquin Phoenix fan, Til today that is. Finally, for once, the reviews on IMDB were truthful. There's a reason its rated an overall 9 on here. Not sure how anyone can rate it less than 10, but whatever, i'll take it.
His performance in this film as Joker is nothing less than Oscar-worthy. I never thought I would actually be #teamjoker but I am. I'm not a comic reader so of course I never judge a movie based off of that. It was beautifully directed, and pointed a grim picture of what led up to Joker becoming Joker. Twists and turns in every direction. People complained that it took awhile to get going. NOT TRUE. I'm not going to go into a full synopsis of the film because you can read that on the main page. I'm just giving my thoughts. Best film of the year...if not the last 5 years that I have had the pleasure of watching. Movies have been trash lately, so its nice to finally see a gem like this. I'll say it again... OSCAR"
2236,"Focus on Arthur. This film is on point with what they want told. I've seen movies that deals with the same idea, but this is just a lecture.A very human society revolves around Arthur and sends him down a path full of conflicts and challenges. To understand why this representation of society can be considered normal, you have to see that this is what our contemporary generation has led to. Everything in this film is normal, normal because it happens and happened. We try to prevent it but its so normalized that it still happens. The problem isn't because of having either mental issues or normal issues, its the fact that we consider them two different things, and forget that the simple concept was to comfort the ones who are going through tough times, and just be there for them.We have opened a network of wrongs and it will keep on breeding more wrongs, until we choose to stop and do something about it."
2237,"Acting is amazing, BUT the similarity with Taxi Driver (1976) is too obvious
It is the same in main theme, in plot, in acting, in cinematography even in music (cello theme)
Taxi Driver is much better because it was new, fresh/ It was in a right time. Joker is just a remake -they even do not deny it couse they took De Niro to pley one of the main parts
I wish Joaquin to win an Oscar. but it will be De Niro's too - for Travis"
2238,"So I made an account and I am about to give my first ever movie review because of this film.I'm not a critic and Don't know much about the intricacies of cinema but what I can say is this is a damn good movie, I've never watched a movie so perfect before in my life. Honestly I thought this movie was gonna be a flop but I've never been so glad to be wrong.First off this is a terrifyingly real depiction of mental health, I have depression and was nearly in tears multiple times through this movie because I could feel everything that brought the character Arthur down. My favourite thing about this movie is the music, it's a truly scary score that blends well with the overall tone of the movie, every time you hear the music play you get an overpowering sense of dread and fear of what's about to happen. The violence hits hard but isn't over the top and makes you wonder what more this character is capable of. Never before have I seen pacing so perfect in film, it goes from 0 to 100 so slowly yet so quickly making you realise just how serious Arthur's mental state really is. The only thing wrong with this movie is the feeling of needing more!In the end Joker is the best film I have ever seen, it hits hard and leaves you wanting more from Joaquin Phoenix's exceptional performance that haunted my thoughts for days, I've been to see it 3 times now and my thoughts haven't changed. I truly hope to see this iteration of the Joker again in a sequel or even a cameo for any future projects. Hats off to the director and every person involved in this film, it was beyond perfect!"
2239,"I always go to the one-star reviews first, as the ten star reviews of movies I like will just echo what I think. I like to see what someone who DIDN'T like the movie has to say - ""OK, convince me"".
The one-star reviews are hilarious - they range from the ""I'm different to everyone else!"" cries for attention to the jealous, possessive moans of those people who think that THEIR character or story has been taken from them and turned into something they don't like. Basically no-one convinced me - I didn't read a single thing that maybe think ""Hmm, maybe they have a point. I hadn't noticed that"".
For this is a perfect movie. Even to a superhero agnostic like me. The performance of Joaquin Phoenix beggars belief - from his physical transformation to the acting turn he puts in. I can't imagine anyone in the history of acting portraying this character to such devastating effect. I won't go on, because, as I said, it has all been said in other reviews - suffice to say that I'll be amazed if another movie tops this in my view in 2019. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood might have run it close with 20 minutes shaved off but as it stands, Joker reigns supreme, awards season notwithstanding.
I wondered why the left had took agin this movie, which is no more or less violent than many movies, superhero or no. (And speaking of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, I heard someone on a podcast say they walked out when someone started inflicting violence on a woman. (This was a woman intent on slaughtering people, including an unborn child) So you waited till ten minutes from the end to stage your big protest!?) Then I found out. Apparently Todd Phillips said ""Woke culture has killed comedy"". Big mistake! The memo went out. The Hive Mind was apprised. Nothing he did was ever to be favourably reviewed again. Good. More room in the cinema for me."
2240,"Lot's of people give it a 9 or a 10. I give it a 6.
For your info: When my opinion is usually 1 point better for a movie .
First I didn't think Todd Phillips should have used a Super Hero/Super Villain character for this role.
(from here on very minimal spoilers)
It's a bit like making Super man lazy and boring and not using his powers.
I would at least wanted Joker to ending up as a criminal master mind.
Even Thomas Wain was misrepresented in the movie. Further I heard there would be 'plot twists' in the movie - I think the two that were there were not really that interesting.
My advice, watch it on the small screen. I wish I spend my money and time on Rambo: Last Blood."
2241,Phoenix does not deserve an Oscar for this. He deserves 2! Incredible performance from him. The film itself is a hard watch. Relentless misery for an hour before we see Joker 'fight back'. This film will affect you unless you have a swinging brick instead of a heart.
2242,"I have never in my life felt a movie like I did the joker. This movie is truly a masterpiece and it made me feel something I have never felt before. I cant stop thinking about the movie after I watched it yesterday I am just completely blown away. The music, the actor, the story.. Truly something else. My expectations were so high for this movie and the movie was far better then I ever imagined. Jesus Christ if you haven't seen this movie you are in for a treat. Im gonna go watch it again bye."
2243,"This film is not for everyone, certainly. After seeing it in the theaters, I had to actually think a few days whether I liked it or not. The answer was no, I did not like it, I LOVED it. What a performance by the one and only, Joaquin Phoenix! He HAS to get an Oscar for this, without a doubt. If not now, then when?"
2244,"I went mostly because other family members wanted to go, and I was blown away. If he doesn't win every best actor award something is wrong. I couldn't believe how great this movie was and watching him devolve into madness was so compelling and grotesquely beautiful. A must see!"
2245,Before watching the Joker I heard a lot of bad about it that it's gonna be politically bad and stuff like that but I knew different I knew that this is going to be an art. And I wasn't wrong. The delivered performance by Phoenix and his deep connection with Arthur is something a true movie fan should watch and reflect on. A true Oscar contender.
2246,"The movie was excellent and amazing, from the beginning that Joaquin's personality is seen as he evolves in the Joker until the end."
2247,"The performance of Joaquin Phoenix in this movie is from beginning to end outstanding and in my opinion rivals that of Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight which is one of my favorite movies of all time! Phoenix's performance done to every detail perfectly portrays the character he was supposed to be and makes it 100% believable. This performance in the lead role is truly an artist at the top of his game, and any better performance is hard to find. Phoenix makes you feel sympathy and understanding for a character that previously was usually regarded as just a crazy and interesting Batman villain. This Joker truly went through Hell to become the character, and it shows how mental illness and it's relation to society really impacts people just maybe not to this extent. The characters descent into madness is extremely hard to watch in a way because you wish you could do something to help, maybe you even feel to some extent it isn't his fault. Then at the end the man that you saw progress through the film becomes who you knew he was going to become anyway, but somehow through the whole thing it almost feels like a surprise nevertheless because you don't feel like he is really a bad guy. This is all just about the main character and the lead actors stellar performance. The rest of the movie is outstanding too, as the casting, music, and every choice made for this film feels like exactly what it should be. Robert De Niro is another shining star in this movie in my opinion and is a very interestinG and important character. Regarding music my favorite scene in the film is when Arthur is dancing on the stairs that he previously trudged over and it makes you feel like this is when he truly becomes the Joker and is free in a sense. In terms of music it is all set to Rock and Roll Part 2 by Gary Glitter which was a perfect choice despite the controversy of using the song. The scene at the end on the Murray Franklin show is also outstanding as although you know Arthur has committed heinous crimes his monologue makes some sense and it doesn't feel like entirely his fault, and it is all capped off with a killer knock knock joke (pun intended) as instead of shooting himself like he planned he kills Murray Franklin. This is where the character of Joker is truly his own person as now there is now going back. Despite it being kind of cheap to reference Batman the way the Wayne's are tied in is very intriguing. Thomas and Martha Wayne end up being killed by a clown protester because of the movement establishing the Wayne's as some of their most hated figures, and it makes it seem like Joker and Batman were
Always meant to be archenemies. Unfortunately yet fortunately the end of this film when Arthur is in Arkham makes what happened in this movie less black and white and more gray. It seems to show that Arthur had imagined the happenings of the movie to some extent because Arkham looks entirely different from what we saw during the course of the film and Arthur has been shown to imagine things to an extreme degree. This however is perfectly appropriate for the Joker as he once said if he must have a backstory he prefers it to be multiple choice. This film from start to end is fantastic and is a must see. Every detail of the film is perfect. Now to the counter arguments as some of the people I know have seen this film didn't not enjoy it at all and have presented arguments I will address. The first criticism is that the movie is slow moving and boring. Addressing the first part of that the movie may seem slow because it is about a mans descent into madness and how his mental illness and treatment by society contributed to it or even caused it. This process is not a quick one, and even in the movie it all unfolds in a relatively short period of time. The movie is ""boring"" part of this argument can be attributed to a few things. Either the person saying this is a psychopath, they have watched too many marvel and more campy superhero movies, or they just don't understand the film. This film contains stellar acting, great music, an interesting an engaging plot that is related to the real world, and some extremely violent and graphic things. If this movie is ""boring"" to you not only did you come in with the wrong expectations, but you are looking at the movie in the wrong way. The final argument I heard against this film is that it isn't ""fun"" and the ridiculousness of this statement is truly indescribable. This movie is not intended to be a fun, campy superhero story similar to the marvel films or something else which I like too may I say. This movie addresses real life issues of our society and is not meant to be taken lightly. This movie is rated r for a reason it is some heavy stuff. This film is gritty, realistic, and serious just how it should be, and if you don't like that than leave the rest of us moviegoers to appreciate the true masterpiece this film is. Besides that I truly think this film is fun to watch just in a different way. This film is fun to watch because it is extremely well made and in my opinion is perfect in every detail and decision. Not all movies are fun to watch because they are funny, not serious, and not violent. All a movie needs to be fun is to be well made and Joker certainly is that. This film is legitimately one of my favorite movies of all time, and Joaquin Phoenix performance as the Joker rivals that of Heath Ledger's! This movie is a must see and should absolutely win some oscars, but if it doesn't that just proves how much of a joke they are. Just do me and yourself a favor don't go to the Joker movie and expect to have fun, and laugh along to a campy and funny superhero movie. Those kinds of films have their time and place and are enjoyable but this film should not be that way at all and you shouldn't expect it to be. This movie is a new take on the Joker character with the ideas of serious issues regarding mental health and society being the main theme of it. This movie is violent, realistic, creepy and maybe even terrifying. This is not a marvel movie; this is not the 60s Batman TV show and it is like nothing you have seen before, but if you listen to what I said and come in with the right expectations than this movie can be regarded as one of the best films ever made especially a comic book film."
2248,"Can't say anything about the acting, so real, so dark."
2249,"So riveting, so addicting was the actors performance that despite there being NO action and very little story advancement after an hour into the film, I was still glued to the screen and sympathetic.
NOT a typical comic book movie; many fans of the genre will feel left out, as the film is essentially a rant against the (lack of) mental health treatment and offers scant Origin material.
The elder Wayne was portrayed in very bad light. I found this alternate interpretation clumsy, but not unexpected, as leftist Hollywood hasn't the guts to portray any white characters as good.
""Joker's"" origin in this version does not allow this character to display any of the genius typically associated with the character.
Joaquin Phoenix's realistic portrayal of mental illness, without campiness or empty sensationalism, will shed light on a societal ill and undoubtedly garner him Oscar nominations."
2250,A Masterpiece thanks to Phoenix. I don't know whether they should make a sequel or not but this one is must to watch
2251,"A genuine interpretation from Joaquin take us to feel the empathy and the deep pain he goes into.... amazing actor who transmit very well every emotion and stage he goes thru. Some people claiming the movie was odd, too dark and pacing but, in my opinion The odd and pacing on this movie was necessary for the public to understand what is mental illness. Photography, sound track and direction is delightful. Definily a must own movie, watched for second time already and I will many more. Bravo 👏🏻 and grateful for this movie, I do celebrate the success of this amazing film. Well deserved."
2252,I was enough sure that this will give me some unforgettable moments but things get really amazing when i finally saw it and I was like i need 1 or 2 minutes to think about what was just happened in the scene. I mean how can a person go deep into these scene for some fraction of second and suddenly newer trench waiting for you. So unbelievable. Iam happy and thanks god to keep me alive so that i am able to see this cinema
2253,"Incredible performance
Can strongly recommend the movie, even if you disliked the precious films."
2254,One of the best film I have ever seen in my life 🔥🔥🔥
2255,Joaquin Phoenix did justice to the role. I wouldn't compare it with Heath Ledger's Joker. Both of them are equally amazing. But this movie is much more darker. The movie portrays how society created the dark nemesis of Batman. It is darker than most DC movies. Nolan portrayed it as an evil but intelligent schemer. But this movie portrays how a schizophrenic and depressed person who wanted people to accept him was pushed to a limit even by his mother decided to put an end to it. Phoenix has made a lot of sacrifice and justice to the roles. One thing that I found in the movie that didn't fit is killing of Bruce's parents. But it has a poetic justice I suppose. Society created Joker and Joker setting motion to events that made him by means of a movement created by him create Gotham's dark Knight. And man oh man Robert De Niro was a treat to watch.
2256,"Artsy, well acted, perfect script, great costumes, simply the film making at its best. Speechless. Deserved all the hypes, hopefully, the movie will get all the awards it deserves."
2257,"MAGNATIC performance ! OUTSTANDING writing ! FINE directing !
JOKER is TRULY MAGNIFICENT !
this year OSCAR belongs to JOKER !"
2258,"Phoenix does a great job but, realistically besides the fact it takes place in Gotham and the minimal role of the Wayne family this movie has nothing to do with the Batman franchise. It's really a biopic of a crazy person who after learning certain things and experiencing certain events decides to stop resisting his crazy urges. Still a good must-see movie but, I think they're just coat-tailing off the notoriety of Batman to draw-in more audiences. They could literally change the name of this movie to ""The Clown"", place it in Detroit, and substitute Thomas Wayne for some other billionaire like Elon Musk and it wouldn't change the narrative at all."
2259,"The last study of an excruciating descent into madness may have been Taxi Driver. Ironically Robert DeNiro starred in that and costars here. That is where the similarities end. This movie will make you cringe, squirm and uncomfortably remind us all of times in our life when we looked away from troubled individuals. Joachim Phoenix will win the best actor at the Golden Globes, the Oscars and any other award show on the planet. I did not want to give this film a 10 out of 10 stars only because it was TOO REAL! Phoenix was in pretty much every frame and it will go down as his masterpiece. If no one ever saw Joker the world may actually be a better, safer place."
2260,"This movie is just outstanding, from the Music to the writing and camera and just the little things.
It's just a Masterpiece and I will need to watch it a second time in a few days.
JP needs to get the Oscar because his Performance to me was once in a lifetime, the Laughter and the anger he shows are more than just acting it's in his soul I feel like.
I can't say enough about his performance.
A masterpiece and just perfect from beginning to end.
Every thing I wished for and even more.
Thank you very much for this amazing experience of Cinema"
2261,"The Joker is not a superhero movie. It is a nihilistic portrayal of a man whom the ever growing, expanding and corrupt world has forgotten. This man feels left out, betrayed and morally ignored.In a world which, like our own, subjects its peoples to vapid, cheap and emotionless stigma, Arthur Fleck (whom Joaquin Phoenix portrays flawlessly) has no cultural or human belonging. He longs for (as he expresses himself) the pain to stop, and thus for the world to understand him, which it never has. It is a world which seems too preoccupied with pleasing its elite and their needs, instead of understanding what lies at the root of the human and criminal psyche. It brushes its criminals and lower classes off, claiming them to be ""clowns"", when in fact they are a reaction to the agenda manufactured by this elite to destroy culture, meaning, tradition and values in exchange for cheap thrills which mean nothing.And of course, this does lead to the utter and total collapse of civilization in the movie. However, at times I kept wondering; is this a movie based on fiction, or is it a movie predicting what is to come?See this movie. Understand it."
2262,"Just go see it. Perfect acting, cinematography, sound and story. A beautiful piece of work worth seeing even if you don't like superhero films."
2263,"Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of the joker is perfect, and exactly what I was hoping for. His theatrical prowess balanced seamlessly with his darker psychedelic side. The amount of time he has put into the character is obvious, from his physical clown like characteristics to his - almost frightening laughter which will be ringing in your head for days to come. This is not a superhero movie nor can you compare Phoenix to Heath Ledger. One thing for sure both their portals of the Joker are unique and individually immense."
2264,"*What do you get when you cross paths with the mind of a mentally ill loner?
You get JOKER*A thunderous and stimulating performance by Joaquin backed up by the visionary direction of Todd Philips.
Never in my wildest dreams did I picture Todd being so capable of bringing out such a diverse issue through the lens of his promising direction.
The soundtrack was on spot. The sounds spoke for the movie ar times.
Quite a refreshing experience.
Oscar needs Joaquin, rather than Joaquin needing one. His expressions were so accurate and enchanting.
Those who are caught in the dark gossamer of loneliness and despair would readily connect with this movie."
2265,"Very dark and gritty drama.A very violent origin movie about mental illness.
A character study of the making of an evil monster.Joaquin Phoenix really delivers a dark, gritty 'Joker', it's a truly brilliant portrayal of an individual's miserable life, he is an individual only seeking human connection in a society that's in gradual decline. You may even find yourself empathising with the Joker?This is very different from any other DC (or Marvel) movie that has come before. You may notice that no CGI is utilised throughout the 117 minutes, although none is necessary. The film is all about the atmosphere and an Oscar worthy performance from an almost unrecognisable Joaquin Phoenix, the Oscar board always likes extreme body transformations."
2266,"I noticed a couple of downsides on the directors end, but that doesn't belittle any of Joaqin's beautiful masterpiece."
2267,"After the movie I couldn't stop smiling. Super satisfying ,an amazing take on one of the most iconic villain of all time and it should have been longer."
2268,"I went into this with low expectations. Knowing it would not have Batman nor any action in it.... And wow, was I surprised and impressed. This movie had my full attention from start to finish.Yes, it is dark and disturbing. But it is a well done dark and disturbing film. The performances were spot on all around.The ONLY reason I give this movie 9 stars instead of 10 is for the simple fact that the Joker appears to be in his 40's here when he meets Bruce Wayne as a little boy. Meaning that the Joker will be an old fragile man by the time Bruce Wayne eventually grows up to become his arch rival Batman. Batman would have no problem taking him down.So it will be interesting to see how they handle that in future installments. But THIS initial installment itself was brilliant."
2269,"Todd Lewis really hit it on the head, with the inner message of this film. Amazing!"
2270,This is a dark and twisted take on this iconic character. I love the approach Todd took with this character. No this is not a world building comic book film; this film is a character study on a tragic character that was abandoned from society at a young age and turned into a twisted psychopath. Joaquin is Arthur and is so lifelike I felt as if I was watching a found footage film. And yes I'm aware this is not a found footage film but you know what I mean. I love the twist in this film and how it dove deeper into his illness. We are viewing a disturbing individual that has many internal problems and I feel the cinematography compliments the world Arthur is viewing. You are viewing a colorfully dark picture which is what I feel Arthur is viewing daily. Arthur is fighting between colorful (positive) and dark (negative) emotions. There is not much plot in this film but the psychological illness this character brings fixes the lack of story. The ending does go on a little too long but nevertheless it just adds to this iconic character!
2271,Social Worker: Is something funny?Arthur Fleck: I just thought of a funny joke!Social Worker: Do you mind telling it?Arthur Fleck: ...You wouldn't get it.
2272,"Do not expect a fast paced action adventure. This is a different kind of movie to the usual DC/Marvel stuff. This is a pure psychological thriller of epic proportions with incredible character development. It is already one of my favourite all time movies. It is an instant classic which is becoming somewhat of a rarity these days.This is a pure origin story of how Arthur Fleck slowly became The Joker. In fact it isn't really much about The Joker at all, but rightly more about Arthur Fleck. Joaquin Phoenix has given us the most human version of the character yet as he slowly descends into insanity. If he doesn't win an oscar for this then just scrap the awards altogether.It really raises empathy about mental health issues, what it is like struggling day to day living with the loneliness and stigmas of poor mental health within a cruel heartless society, and for Arthur who we learn also has empathy too for the underdog. This is definitely not a comic book flick. I am no huge Batman fan, but I am now a big fan of The Joker. I left the cinema feeling that I learned something new about myself. He wasn't laughing, he was crying."
2273,"The story, act and music was excellent. Joker is a dark caracter and this movie gives him full credit."
2274,"Looking at this from a business perspective...the career move that director Todd Phillips made was brilliant. It was a brilliant move but I wasn't totally certain it would make for a brilliant film - I wasn't sure if he had it in him. As he's stated in recent interviews, he hit a point where he felt he could no longer make crude comedies for an American audience, which is what he's been known for (The Hangover trilogy, Old School, etc), and I feel that completely. So where do you go from there? Considering comic book movies are one of the only types of movies that get large production budgets in 2019, he takes an iconic comic book character, takes one of the most intense and interesting A-list actors we have working, and instead of making another carbon-copy, commercialistic, and fully forgettable CGI-fest full of fart jokes and giant robots getting knocked over, he makes a movie with some actual psychological depth! What a way to work around this troubled system! One must generally adapt in order to capitalize.As far as the film itself, I knew Phillips and Phoenix would create something entertaining, but I could not have expected the sheer masterpiece they pulled off. From every angle... the writing, the directing, the editing, the photography, the pacing - it's all impeccable and I am beyond impressed. There's not a dull moment and every single scene plays an important role in the tension-building and the unfolding of every little plot element. And, of course, the acting... this could be very well be the greatest performance of Joaquin Phoenix's career, which is a colossal statement considering his mountain of phenomenal films, and the fact that he might be my #1 of this era. Literally every shot where Phoenix is on the screen disperses an outpour of complex emotions - never just one, always a smorgasbord, like when you've eaten half an eighth of mushrooms and they've just begun kicking in, and you feel entirely overwhelmed. There were more psychological twists than I was expecting and they had me pretty stirred up as they piled atop each other.As far as all the negative press around this movie, I find it all almost entirely off base and misdirected. Sarcastic comments like ""Finally, a movie for angry white men who can't get everything they want""... as if there has never been any other films about any psychopaths, maniacs, criminals, or serial killers who also happen to be white men, which have been praised endlessly for decades? Simultaneously we have oodles of people praising shows like MINDHUNTER, with no negative press, while JOKER is getting attacked. They are both about the same thing...psychotic serial killers. That's what this is... an intricate character study about a blossoming psychopath and killer, which also happens to include a multitude of themes that can be aligned with societal obstacles we are currently facing in reality. Yes, you put yourself in the villain's shoes, and you feel fractions of the pain that villain is feeling, but the point is not to GLORIFY or CELEBRATE such darkness, but rather to wallow in it just long enough to feel disrupted then get the hell out of there and go back to your normalcy. JOKER has a lot of heart, a lot of blood pumping through it's veins, and a working brain too - it's actually the most human movie I have seen this year, with the most depth.I could say a lot more, but I will wrap up instead. I had a smile plastered across my face for 75% of this movie, as I was constantly blown away by either some element of what I was seeing. The other 25% I was scared, sad, or excited - but I was never bored. Not for a second. Every MOMENT was stimulating, and meticulously crafted. This is actually one of the only truly masterful movies I have EVER seen based off of a comic book character - not only is it special in that sense, but it's also boosted Todd Phillips to the league of legendary filmmakers. I'm curious to see if this is a chance one-off, or if Phillips will carry on as a dramatic filmmaker, after going above and beyond with this one. 10 out of 10, in my opinion."
2275,"Hopefully with the success that Joker is having, farting DC that his characters do not work with the formula of Marvel, what they did with Joker is totally the opposite of any blockbuster comics movie, bloody, explicitly dark violence. And all that makes it great, in addition to the direction of photography and color palettes, the excellent interpretation of Joaquin Phoenix and the script."
2276,"Overall Great movie!!! (writing, direction, acting)
I am excited to see if it's strength raises the bar for newer releases.
It's plot sings the blues of the jokers story and does so with nostalgic aesthetics- combining ""Taxi driver"" psycology with a ""King of Comedy"" theme (Coincidently two movies starring De Niro & directed by Scorsese).
The emphasis was heavy on the mental illness and misfortunes of Arthur Fleck but unexplored were the entertaining/ musicality traits of a joker.
The playfulness that was expressed through the character seemed more-so of Joaquin Phoenix and less in the spirit of Joker.
Throughout the movie the Joker is portrayed as self conscious and the resolution/ climaxed rebellion is an out-cry from that- not so much on his real connection to Gotham or a villainous reign.
That said I don't see this Joker bright enough to be an infamous, self sustaining, street-wise villain."
2277,"I enjoy different types of movies. I love ""popcorn movies"", silly comedies, almost anything done reasonably well. Then there are movies like this one. A great movie is like an Alfred Hitchcock movie. It doesn't just leave you there in your seat unaffected by it. This movie is at different times, genuinely disturbing, puzzling, electrifying, and unpredictable as to what will happen next. Excellent writing & cinematography, which would have gone to waste if not for the incredible performance by Joaquin Phoenix. If you love to see what the art of acting is about, go see this movie."
2278,"I'm astonished at this movie. I went in with high expectations and it blew them away! While I was even watching it I kept telling myself what an amazing movie. The pacing is fantastic, constantly keeping you engaged but still building suspense. Joaquin Phoenix gave a chilling and sympathetic proformance, just absolutely amazing."
2279,"The shooting, the music, the story telling and the great Joaquin Pheonix.. just ahhh"
2280,A good movie for a Saturday night. The line up is well chosen. Actors are great.
2281,"Finally, justice and a more than worthy replacement to Nolan's and Ledger's Joker (character) in The Dark Knight. I think that endorsement alone is enough to get most of you to watch this film.What an amazing movie and let me tell you that to me there was very few comedic and outright funny moments. I found the movie for the most part to be serious and hauntingly sad.What a performance and character portrayal by Mr. Joaquin Phoenix. WOW."
2282,Definitely best movie of the year ... And a movie to be remembered ... Joaquin Phoenix must win an oscar for this performance
2283,"Classic cinema trope has always glorified heroes, and while there have been a few memorable characters we've loved from the ""bad"" side, the JOKER has earned much more than any of that - the character, despite doing things that should meet universal disdain, is respected. And given his appearance and name that literally exudes humour, this character is a beautiful, or rather, genius irony.'The Dark Knight' made me look at him in awe and reverence, and when I heard this enigma was finally getting an origin story, I was getting what I wanted. The Joker, after all, is an ordinary human, and what could've possibly gone wrong with a man that turned him into a brilliant chaotist - one who could bring down the likes of Batman himself.Joaquin Phoenix has convinced me that the Joker didn't die with Heath Ledger. I mean, the actor has carried the film on his shoulders with such conviction. The laughter, the swag, the creepiness, the taunting tease - everything. It's hard not to have any admiration for what he's done.And the way his journey has been portrayed is definitely satisfying. He's the hero of his own story. One cannot avoid feeling for the poor man - and the cruelties he has to endure. For someone already battling medical issues, his sanity gets its final push when he learns about his mother and his actual childhood, that's when he loses it.His walk to the elevator in his full costume to attend his TV show, with the background music playing, is probably the most kickass scenes of all - when his entry finally arrives. The theatre erupted in screams and howls. And what happens at the show comes definitely as a shocker, though I was expecting something. The crowd redeems him from the cops and he stands atop a cop car, carving that smile on his face with the blood in his mouth. That scene...wheww!!Finally, the director. Todd Philips has given me my all-time favourite comedy gems like ""the road trip"" and ""the Hangover series"". His command on making comedy films is impeccable. So when I saw his name as the director - I was really surprised. Not that he isn't talented, but it's just that one wouldn't expect a movie of this type from him. And all I can say after watching it is....the man is definitely a genius - a versatile one at that. He has paid homage to another of my favourite gems, from Martin Scorsese - ""The Taxi driver"". And to borrow the line of daily living and thinking of the taxi driver for the Joker was pretty much justified."
2284,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Obviously, Joker is one of my most anticipated movies of 2019. I mean, how couldn't it be?! Besides belonging to the superhero genre, DC has been on a streak of great films within its universe, so an isolated installment definitely excites me, especially about one of the evilest villains ever. It's by far one of the less comic-book-y flicks of the century. It doesn't follow the generic origin story formula, it avoids any cliches associated with the genre, and it's the type of movie that's becoming more and more rare nowadays. It's a character study like we haven't seen in a long time.I'll simply begin with the person that elevates the entire thing: Joaquin Phoenix. Now, if there's something I'm not going to do is compare his performance with Heath Ledger's. That's the number one mistake people are going to keep making forever. First of all, The Dark Knight and Joker couldn't be more distinct films, even if they belong to the same genre (despite Joker being unique, it's still about a famous comic-book villain). Then, despite Phoenix and Ledger portraying the same ""version"" of the clown (crazy, sadistic psychopath), the former is 90% Arthur Fleck while the latter is 100% Joker, throughout each of their movies. Finally, Phoenix is the sole protagonist of this feature, while Ledger had the best live-action Batman sharing the spotlight.In conclusion, it's both unfair, and a bit unreasonable to compare both interpretations since their roles have a different impact on the narrative, as well as each film being entirely different. In the end, both are impressive. However, let's switch to Phoenix since he's the star of this show ... He has 2019's best performance, by far! With a strong marketing campaign, I'm sure he'll get that Oscar. I hope so! It's so well-deserved. Todd Phillips and Scott Silver developed a brilliant screenplay, but Phoenix elevates it to a whole other level.Throughout the entire runtime, I felt weird. Perturbed. Even uncomfortable with what I was watching and consequently feeling. It's a dark, brutal, violent, emotionally powerful origin of a villain who I feel disturbingly empathetic towards. Phoenix makes the story work due to its remarkably captivating display of someone who's mentally ill. Arthur Fleck slowly becoming crazier is due to how society behaves and not due to some chemical pool that transforms his skin white and hair green (nothing wrong with this, but I know which origin story I prefer). ""The world is getting crazier out there"", and it becomes excruciatingly painful to deal with it, especially when so much is going on with Arthur's personal life, and most of it he doesn't even realize because he tries to hide everything behind a smile.It's a screenplay filled with narrative twists that not only pack a punch of surprise but leave you feeling extremely upset. The last act is one of the best in the last few years. If the second act is an enormous build-up, the last one is a terrific payoff. I can't remember the last movie I saw where I loved 100% every single narrative decision. I wouldn't do any of the big moments differently. There are so many excellent references hidden in plain sight that comic-book fans (and fans of the TDK trilogy as well) will love just like I did. In the ending, there's one pivotal moment in particular that serves as the absolute climax ... I got chills all over my body. They couldn't have done that scene more perfect. I only have one tiny nitpick with the way some scenes feel repetitive since they neither move the plot forward or give us anything new. Some of these still help to create tension, some feel like they're just... there.A Best Picture and Best Actor nominations seem to be on its way, but these are not the only achievements that deserve to be recognized. The original score by Hildur Guðnadóttir is incredibly addictive, so much that I'm listening to it while writing this review. It definitely helps to generate tremendous build-up, and it elevates the sinister environment of Gotham City. Lawrence Sher's cinematography is utterly stunning. The underexposure of some scenes is glorious. Sher paints the screen with so many gorgeous shots, especially with his close-ups on Phoenix, where the latter is able to shine. Jeff Groth is also impeccable in the editing room. There are several long takes with Phoenix just giving his all and letting all his emotions out (or keeping them all contained), which is always something I deeply appreciate since it helps with the flow of the narrative.Regarding the film's controversy surrounding its messages and the incentive to violence, I really don't know what to say. It's ridiculous. I remember those times when going into the movie theater was a surreal experience. It was the number one place for people to forget about their lives, jobs, everything. Joker is a fictional story! It's the origin of one of the worst psychopaths in the history of comic-books and cinema. If people expected to leave the theater ""happy"" or ""joyful"", then at least one of the film's message is right: society really is getting crazier. Have people forgotten who Joker is? What could you possibly expect from his origin story?!Nowadays, no one knows how to behave (social media is the primary source for spreading hate). No one respects the fellow citizen or even the world itself. More and more people only look at their own bellies. Political agendas are everywhere. New extreme movements are created every other year. Social hypersensibility is exponentially growing. The same way some people will hate this movie for not being able (or simply not wanting) to accept that they feel empathy towards a murderer, people all around the world behave like their actions don't reflect on another person's life and on their own planet. If people get ruthlessly violent because they watched Joker, how can someone complain that the film's message is bad when it's eventually true?All in all, Joker is one of the best movies of the year, and it's definitely on my Top3 at the date of this review. Joaquin Phoenix delivers my favorite male performance of 2019, by elevating a script about the origin of one of the evilest villains ever. The way he gradually becomes more insane is worthy of study, but it's how he's able to make the audience create empathy towards a psychopath that leaves me disturbingly captivated. Todd Phillips produces a character-study filled with an astonishingly tense build-up and one of the most chill-inducing payoffs of the last few years. With every single narrative decision nailed perfectly, Hildur Guðnadóttir's score and Lawrence Sher's cinematography stand out. The lack of restraint in showing the unmerciful violence (physical and mental) that society inflicts on one another is what makes us feel unsettled. Because we know it's mostly true, and we refuse to accept it. It's not a film about the Joker. It's a very realistic portrayal of someone (anyone!) who can become someone like him. And it's disturbingly brilliant!PS: Robert DeNiro (Murray Franklin) and Zazie Beetz (Sophie Dumond) are also great. Phoenix's performance is so mesmerizing that I almost forgot there were other actors in the movie."
2285,"This film is about a man who begins to start a crippling downfall with his own sanity and mental state. Believe the hype and excitement over this movie, never before have I ever seen a movie use such gut-wrenching realism to it's advantage before. With little to no issues with the movie itself, this movie is up there with the top movies of this year or dare I even say top movies of the decade. Understanding the complexity of the psychological mind of a human as he/she goes through various levels of distress shows how impossibly intelligent this film is. Without a doubt, I give this movie a perfect 10/10, go and watch this film NOW!!"
2286,"Todd Phillips' 'Joker' is a well written, incredibly directed and extremely astonishing performed movie. It's a dark movie, including the dark side of life and the part that people want to pretend doesn't exist. The lead actor's Joaquin Phoenix's performance is astonishing to say the least. The cast and crew is very carefully but pinpointed selected making the film surround you with realistic situations that the actors are capable of delivering. The messages, 'Joker', wants to pass are crystal clear and successfully, thus easily, delivered to the audience. The only thing I would consider, not negative, but a bit annoying, is the fact that the batman story is connected with such way to this joker story. To sum up, Todd Phillips', 'Joker' is an excellent, extraordinary film, showing the hard work taken place behind the scenes in the theaters, on the big screen, leaving a bittersweet but joyful feeling."
2287,"Right from the start, this movie has you hooked to your seats and tells a very disturbing tale about a man who is a bullied and disregarded by the society and what makes him turn into a maniac. You feel pain in Arthur's laughter and empathize him.Sheer brilliance, Phoenix has aced the manic cackle and he does deserve an oscar for this . He is as good as Ledger if not better than him.Note : To me he was better than ledger in a few scenes in the movie"
2288,"The popularity and the high ratings centered around this movie is due to Heath Ledger's successful portrayal of the Joker character. While Heath's performance was A-Class, it was still somewhat overrated due to his suicide and alleged but never-confirmed gossip about his suicide relating to his portrayal of Joker.Joaquin Phoenix has been a drama queen and did some weird stuff on TV to regain his lost popularity and therefore people slowly began to see him as an offbeat rogue actor and this allowed him to take on the Joker role.The movie itself, tries to make profit from Phoenix's cooked up antics by always trying to close in on his face while he is moaning or trying to laugh in an out of the ordinary matter.Heath Ledger's character was successful but the camera was never too much in his face. His laughter and his aura spread naturally. However in Phoenix's Joker, director Todd Phillips tried to capitalize too much on the hype of Phoenix's real life antics and Heath Ledger's successful Joker performance by always zooming in on Joker's face in a way to force his mentally unstable state upon the viewers rather then letting the viewesr decide for themselves.On the other hand, the movie is very slow and has unexplainable plot holes. Not recommended."
2289,This film exceeded all of my expectations. It was dark chilling and interesting and has twists that even emotionless critics can enjoy.
2290,Oscar winning movie!!! They should give phoenix an Oscar man!!!!!
2291,"This film is exactly as bad as I thought it would be. It's a great performance for Phoenix but nothing else good can be said about the movie. It is not a comic book movie or even a movie about the character, I didn't find it funny or entertaining. Frankly it's just a mindless blockbuster, it does not provoke thought nor does it have any true commentary. It's made to be edgy but lacks any true substance."
2292,"Yea nothing original in this movie. i'm sure todd was a big taco driverpeople will act they love it and when it comes on hbo they will not be able to make it through a rewatch.if this movie was named ""clown"" half the audience wouldn't have made it through the first viewing.yea good actors can act... but the most impressive thing is how great a cash grab this was by making a inexpensive blockbuster with only a few mouths to feed."
2293,"For me its the best joker movie after dark knight , in sucide squad we dont get to see joker as main still good though leto did his best in joker for sucide squad but it cant compare to phonex coz its the best joker movie so far"
2294,R. Phoenix does great unfortunately the script is very dull and very slow! I almost walked out of movie like some did! I love movies and watch them over and over but I will not watch this one ever again!
2295,"I understand that the acting in this film is good but actually as a film it comes across as a boring arty farty film that no one will truly like but it will win loads of awards.
Sorry DC fans but this was garbage!!!"
2296,"How easily pleased have some people become? When a 'major' movie is this simplistic and obviously just another copy of many other overrated downers - it leaves someone needing to explain how this nonsense then goes on to rate a ridiculous 11 Oscar nominations? Who can truly take the Oscars seriously any longer? Joker is a typical super-ugly, comic book R Rated serial killer story - which grinds its endless way through non-stop, grotesque situations of the most maudlin kind. We've already seen this character (somewhat over-played by Phoenix) far too many times in the past. Even the dark, sleazy settings don't invite interest, and has left many viewers wanting it all to end quickly but no, it drags on for over two hours, feeling painfully more like three.Then there's the casting of an over-used De Niro, intended to help capitalise on some of those 'gangster- obsessed' Scorsese offerings. Many paid to see this over-hyped lowbrow tosh, expecting to experience a masterpiece - only to wish they could get back their time and money for better use.If uninspired morbidity is your thing, you'll get a bellyful - otherwise, stay well away and watch this junk fade into the obscurity it deserves, hopefully, along with the copycat movie makers. The final images this movie creates of carnage on the streets of America, looks more like the sorry, robotic BLM mayhem that's reducing the USA to a decaying mess. Just what the CCP and others would be quite happy to see - Civil War. Such a pitiful shame and a sick joke."
2297,"I don't think it is a coincidence that Robert de Niro was an actor in this movie. Joker plays more like Taxi Driver than any movie I've seen. The same slow descent into madness for a disillusioned and ignored man at the edge of society.I didn't find the film political at all. Because what Phoenix did I felt for his character at a visceral level, beyond good, evil and morality. The entire movie is a joke that only some people get it. The incel thing, for example, was hilarious in retrospect: frightened first worlders trying to instantly put a label on the people that they feared most and needed support more. The exact same reaction as portrayed in the film. The story in this is very personal, in a social context that becomes a constant buzz that fades in the background.If there is any word that could describe Joker is uncomfortable. It's two hours of feeling the suffering of the main character, even as he breaks and does unconscionable things. You can't not root for him. You can't condone it. You can't not be sad. And in the end, when I was thinking this is a great movie but has nothing to do with the DC comics, it ties in the Batman classic storyline with such ease that I couldn't help shivering thinking on what Batman's story would be in this universe of burning sadness.Bottom line: great acting and really fresh ideas that work together perfectly. It's a very adult film, though, and not for everybody."
2298,"In ""Joker,"" I don't see a film worthy of an Oscar nomination for best picture, I don't see a film worthy of high praise. All I see are 45 boring minutes of an identity-less film, an intense third act and a great and Oscar-worthy performance from Joaquin Phoenix."
2299,"Yes, sir.
Joker develops the true meaning of ""character"".
Character in Latin is a synonym for persona, ie ""person"".
But what would a soulless person be?
Probably a caricature.
Something that only exists on a canvas.That's exactly the typical Joker from Batman movies.
A creation that can only be found on a movie screen.
For sure, it's a captivating character, but soulless.
Nobody knows why he is a villain in fact.
In Batman movies, Joker is just there committing crimes, like a puppet.Not here.
What makes a person a villain?
How to give a soul to such a villain?
In real life, a psychopath/ sociopath is a natural born killer or he is shaped like that by his own world.
The proposal of this movie is to give a compelling life to a villain character.Undoubtedly, this is the best movie of 2019: great screenplay, awesome direction and a perfect acting of a soulful character."
2300,"Strong in style & acting, weak in social commentary. Entertaining throughout w/ some actual surprises."
2301,"This movie will certainly catch the interests of everybody in the theatre. Many want to see what it's like to witness pure insanity. Many want to see a clown say ""society"". I went for both of those reasons and was not disappointed. Now stop reading reviews and go experience Joker for the first time!"
2302,This was an unexpected movie. it connects to Bruce Wayne 😜
2303,"Went to go see this movie thinking it would be an awesome movie going by all the reviews it got about how good it is. This movie was the most overrated, worst movie I had ever seen, it was boring, nothing even interesting happened, if you want to see this movie wait until it comes to DVD cause it's a waste. Don't recommend going to the cinema to see it or even seeing it at all."
2304,"Just keep watching some guy get abused, laugh, dance. slow scenes. plot is slow. bleh."
2305,"Here again Phoenix does his go-to awkward,loner-stoner schtick. But this time he surely must get the nod from the Academy for the sheer effort of heavy makeup, scrawnyer than usual body and the gargantuan artistic achievement of forcibly sucking in his stomack in all but every scene.
In fact, Phoenix's stomach is a concave testament to character-building at it purest, as the vacuum at the center of his body is the vacuousness of this entire airheaded one-noted whine of a movie.
Every plot(?)-point is so derivative and contrived as to inevitably turning into a game of spot the reference. Here is mostly steals from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy but also bits from Fight Club amongst others. But with none of their flair in writing and direction, and their note-perfect timely commentary dumbed down here to blunt confusion; a doddering senile «these are the times we live in,now..».
The films protagonist is chased through the movie by the most inept pair of detectives outside a cartoon and the Toker himself is portrayed as so feeble-minded as to be utterly improbable as the eventual master criminal, The Joker.
So what is this mess, really?
Yet again, one more in the endless parade of hateful Hollywood-fantasies of violent,nihilistic murder and mayhem towards anyone who dares to disagree with the losing left.
The protagonist is a catalyst for societal rampage by masked hordes of clowns rioting, burning and pillaging in the streets. They are of course stand-ins for Antifa and Occupy Wall Street.
Wayne, the caricatured politician, calling his possible constituents loser-clowns, is of course a stand-in for Trump. So the writers get to shoot him, too.
Petty? You bet! Who was it again that during election made an ongoing talking point of the peaceful transition of power?"
2306,"I can't say one good thing about this movie. All these reviews here praising Phoenix and I do agree with them but don't act like that wasn't expected, the man has always been an amazing actor. With that said the rest of the movie is pure trash. There is 0 character development, Joker is sad and miserable then when he can't take it any more he just snaps and goes crazy BUT DOES NOTHING. Batmans dad is Jokers dad? That is the most stupid thing in the world. I didn't care about Joker during the movie, I mean, I didn't like him or hate him or anything, whatever. That scene where he washes his mother... what was that? I will tell you, it was just a disgusting scene and nothing more. Anyway, I could go on but who cares, everyone is so stupid these days so a piece of trash like this can be looked at as a masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix I still love you man, you just did your job."
2307,"Dude so this movie is what I would call good. Like there is so much plot in it and it gets intense which makes it intresesting and thot-provoking. Literally though two scantily clad females tried feeling me up during the film and I was like ""dude NOT cool save it for the battle bus"". But yeah anyway so Wakeen Feenix does a nice job playing the joker I mean the pranker I mean Arthur. He's got issues and he ain't afraid to show it. But yeah dude so I'm watching the movie and I was really just thinking the whole time like wow this movie is good. Like when Batman appears i thought oh my god this is like in Godzilla king of the monsters which I saw with the boys in imax on May 31st during the scene where the guy rides gkdzilla's titanic pecker. But yeah and also joker dances but I sat next to these two DUMB kids of dark descent The second time I viewed the movie and I had a throwdown with them cause they were laughing during my movie. Just goes to show how no one respects cinemenama anymore. But yeah dude the movie was trash no JK it was epic and I won't see it again."
2308,Good Performance by Joaquin Phoenix but Heath Ledger was way ahead of the curve.
2309,Very slow and bad acting movie. Screenplay is not up to the mark soo movie is low rating
2310,This film was not entertaining. It contained little to no resemblance to who or what the Joker is supposed to be. It's a failure and should not have been made.
2311,"How many times can we have this character? The only reason people think he's good is cuz he looks weird! Sorry bruh, you ugly and you get good ratings cuz you ugly! I would be better than you."
2312,I was iffy on the trailers so I wanted to wait for DVD. Thank God I did! This movie was awful. Im a Huge Joker fan (character) but the only good part was the last 20 minutes. The whole time I was thinking what the hell am I watching. Joaquin was a great actor as always. The writing was just awful. Save your time and money!
2313,"A masterpiece! Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a pathetic loser in Gotham's fractured society circa early 1980s. By day a clown-for-hire and by night an aspiring stand-up comic Being a successful comedian he could better care for his sick elderly mother living in a rundown apartment. Arthur has a neurological malady that has him breaking out in screeching laughter at inopportune situations. Suffering humiliation and raw despair, his comedy is flat and tends to lead to violence. When the dysfunctional comic gets his hands on a gun discovers what talent he possess is not for comedy. One bad decision after another brings Fleck to the center of a chain reaction of chaos giving a new origin myth of Batman's notable supervillain opponent...The Joker!.Phoenix's performance is pure brilliance. Also featured are: Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Bill Camp, Shea Willingham, Frances Conroy and Brett Cullen."
2314,"The feelings that this movie brings on you are really hard to describe, and it takes a while to swallow completely. Its dark and enters in morality and realistic topics, criticizing the way that society works, how most people see the mental illness and how an economic crisis can afect someone. Joker isn't a monster without feelings, he is a creation of a broken world, a broken Gotham City.
The most amazing part of the film is that they put you in the mind of Arthur Fleck, in a lot of scenes which there is a conflict between Humor, Tension and Fear. Out of nowhere you find yourself and others laughing at a terrible scene, just like the Joker would, and there is nothing you can do about it.
The development of the protagonist is well distributed and it works. His laughs which were once impulsive and uncontrolled turns into a coordenated and at the same time chaotic aspect of the personality of Arthur. I really think that Joaquin Phoenix did an excellent job and deserve at least an indication to the Oscars, being pessimistic.And answering the title of the review:
I tell you what you get, you get the best movie of comics ever made!"
2315,"When i first heard that this film is going to be about a character study, all i want from this film is to be believable enough, and IT IS! the character is powered by Joaquin's incredible performance. but what i get is more than just a believable character but also a good origin story. in this film Joker isn't shown as a mastermind yet, the film really is about a character change from a guy defeated by life into one of the most if not the most iconic DC villain ever."
2316,If you are lifeless friendless broke pathetic mentally ill person you can relate and feel happy for yourself by watching this movie.I dont even know how a person with stable mind can give this movie more than 2 stars i think there is a lot more lifeless people than i thought.
2317,"Dark, boring and crap. Completely void of any entertainment value. Joker character is beyond irritating."
2318,"I am sorry to those who liked this movie but as a DC and all round comics fan, this was a snore fest. This movie from start to finish bored me to tears. Don't get me wrong the acting was sensational but the whole story and premise not to mention it's length ... yawn.... it's hours of my life I am not getting back. The 1 Star is for the acting performances, like I said which were great in the roles but unfortunately the writing, story and premise let all that down."
2319,"Totally disappointed movie ... This smile is so unreal , and why psyho movie should be soo liked , to make un example for other people like this . This world is totally broken , that's why people like this movie ...."
2320,"Why was this so hyped and good? This movie was boring and is not a DC Comics Joker movie. Generally I watch movies at least twice before doing these, but I couldn't watch it again. Joaquin Phoenix's acting was great, but that doesn't make it a Joker movie. This joker is around 50 and batman is maybe 10? Then tried to make Thomas Wayne as the father a possibility. Sorry, but you can't have Joker without having a Batman first. Joker is joker based on his infatuation with Batman along with the chemical accident. The Jared Leto Joker is a better Elseworlds Joker in my opinion. If this movie didn't have the DC Comics label slapped on it, would anyone have watched it? Probably not. This should have been its own thing and not related to the DC Comics Joker, just like Sony's Venom should have been a Life sequel."
2321,"At the heart of this film is an outstanding performance from Joaquin Phoenix. And it is that performance itself that I think distracts from a number of the films shortcomings. Aiming for a gritty down-at-heel look from the opening moments, with the recreation of the Warner Brothers logo from the 1970s, you very much get the mood of classics such as the French Connection and Taxi Driver. Films with no real good guy and a very dower and world weary feel. Within this setting we find struggling clown Arthur Fleck, a man suffering from numerous mental health issues who has been overlooked by the support services, and which are in turn themselves been cutback by the city, and ever demanding budget savings. As the film moves on Arthur becomes more downtrodden and isolated, his connection with reality more and more tenuous, until ... well that's the point of the film - the origin of The Joker. But getting here is not a startling revelation, just an all to believable of another troubled person falling through the cracks of the support services, in a city that doesn't care. Which is an issue that needs addressing and is handled so much better in Phoenix's previous film ""You were never really here"". Maybe the point of the filmmakers were to make it a very grounded take, but I feel that in turn misses the concept of the Joker. Remove the face-paint, cut away the pointless Wayne references and you have a much better film. With it and you have yet another actor undertaking a great physical performance but not much else."
2322,How this movie received the rating it currently has is beyond me. No one will ever be able to top Heith's performance in Batman but this movie is terrible. You feel nothing for Pheonix's character and could nap for the first 2 hours of the movie and still be dissapointed wasting your time with the remaining 30 minutes. All that the movie leaves you with is wanting to smoke a cigarette.
2323,Bad bad and boring movie.dont get the hype bc this was one hell of a slow and bad movie
2324,"So this Joker character has nothing to do with the DCEU's Joker, the name and the Waynes and Gotham city is just added as a cheap shot to sell this no-so-good drama. And apparently it works, if you can believe the IMDb score. Probably because people go to a DCEU movie and instead they see two hours of whimpering that the rich are so evil and the government doesn't care about us and that's what sells these days."
2325,Good acting but movie is what I expected slow piece of crap.
2326,Worst movie i ever saw in a theatre. I cant really figure out the movie. Dont waste ur time watching this movie
2327,"Movie about lonely psycho who is loser and can't handle his life.
I don't understand the hype about it? Why glorify such a PoS character?"
2328,"Clearly not worth the hype and all the tens. Can it get awards? I guess so, but to anyone saying it should every possible Oscar ans such... LOL. Maybe I'm this much critical because I'ce Nevers been able to liké any mobile that had JP as a lead.... to me he always has the play the most annoying characters dors si particularly annoyingly."
2329,"Society is society, everyone struggles in their own way. Movie doesn't go with any particular storyline, no message conveyed."
2330,Holy cow did I almost fall asleep while watching this movie. Joaquin Phoenix was fine but it just felt like Joaquin pheonix in clown makeup with long hair. Sorry but every performance as the joker doesn't mean oscar worthy winning. People gotta lay off the over hype. Movie was boring the last 20 minutes where okay but it dragged on and on.
2331,"Until now, the only review of this movie that I mostly agree with is the review from The Times. I stole the title of this review because it just hits the nail on the head.In the first impulse, I didn't even want to watch this movie, because I'm just fed up with the Joker. DC has many, much more interesting villains than Joker. It's time to tell stories about them and not constantly repeat the Joker's story, where there is no chance to say anything new, because in fact the Joker is not an interesting story at all, anymore. A rejected, angry man, who fails in life, a clown who becomes a killer - story as old as the world.Everything that could be said about Joker, said Nolan in the Dark Knight Trilogy, plus various comics and yes - Batman and Joker cartoons too. Nolan also told the Joker story more subtly than this movie, not only by the whole story structure, but also excellent dialogues. People who, I already see, claim in the reviews, that it is this film, that fully reflects the depth of the Joker character or that it is such a successful '' artistic '' film - they simply try to cast a spell on reality, giving the film a meaning that doesn't exist .In Nolan Trilogy Joker is really The Joker - madman, but with hatred and goal to burn the world down. Joker kills Rachel which Bruce never gets over. Alfred burns Rachel's last words to save Bruce from more pain. In an attempt to save Bruce from confronting Bane, Alfred disarms him with the truth even if it means saving his life. Even tho he isn't mentioned in the 3 film, you see how Joker messed up the characters in this film . But he isn't the ONLY ONE who beat Batman in this trilogy. All the villains beat Batman in one way or another. Ra's broke Batman's will, Scarecrow broke his mind, Joker broke his spirit, Two-Face broke his hope, Bane broke his body, Talia broke his heart, hell even Catwoman broke his trust early on....Joker didn't know Batman's identity. He didn't even plan to torment Bruce for years.....But the effects of his actions in the previous film TDK are felt in the third one. By corrupting Dent, both Batman and Gordon had to stage a cover up - we see Gordon struggling to deal with this lie, praising the man who almost killed his child. The lie he told 8 years ago for the greater good is eating him up inside. Then there is Bruce - Joker may not have known his identity but he certainly deduced that Rachel meant something to Batman. Joker kills too many people to force Batman to remove his mask and Dent boldly steps up to claim he's Batman. Rachel sees this on the news and is disappointed that Bruce did nothing to intervene and it's arguable this is what drives her to write the letter choosing Dent over Bruce. It is this same letter Alfred burns to spare Bruce more pain, thus leading to the bitter break-up between Bruce and Alfred.This third movie is the aftermath of the Joker's actions and how the characters and city of Gotham are coping with it after 8 years. TDKR feeds off the relevance of its predecessors like any good third installment. 8 years of false peace covering a giant lie and watching that lie eat at Bruce, Gordon and the city.The lie that enabled The Dent Act to be passed, removing organized crime and as a result removing the need for a Batman. The rich and elite benefitting from the clean streets while the middle class and poor gap widens.The fact that Batman and Gordon had to lie proves to the League that Gotham is truly beyond hope and must be destroyed.And a lie that caused Bruce and Alfred to break up....Joe Chill broke his happiness when he pulled the trigger and fired the bullets that killed his parents and also Falcone and Maroni were indirectly responsible for Batman's birth, and what makes Nolan's trilogy a masterpiece is indeed how each of his enemies are responsible for major tragedies in his life or events that will scar him for life and as for the enemies he fought in the trilogy. I would say that The Joker (not only cause he's the archenemy) is the one who got under his skin in the most personal way not only by killing Rachel but by corrupting the ""honest and perfect"" White Knight but because he forced Batman to take on a role that in Batman's eyes it would be best for him by sparing the truth of who the real white knight was when he was pushed to his limits.Nolan put in each film the right villains needed for all 3 stories. Not only are they responsible for tragedies in Bruce's life, but they mirror Bruce like some twisted perversion of what he could have been IF he crossed the line of an executioner. This is for me one of the most interesting elements of Batman from the source material.Him never crossing the line his villains deliberately or accidentally cross is what he uses to check himself so he doesn't end up like them. In Rises there are many instances where I actually thought Bruce wouldn't make it! Seeing a hero humiliated and vanquished was so unexpected and effective it made me actually care for Bruce more than ever! There was a lot at stake this time around... More emotional layers are in the third film.The problem with THIS movie is that the creators here openly say, that Joker is mentally ill. What?! This is a parody of the whole idea of The Joker. Yes, he is a sadist and psycho, but not in the sense of '' crazy ''. Besides, this movie is also full of cheap and failed imitations and quotes from movies like Taxi Driver or the Nolan Trilogy, Why do so few people notice it? This is not a breakthrough film, it is a mixture of everything that came before. Infantile psychology at the level of high school dramas for teens and the plagiarism of many other outstanding films. Making a '' serious '' movie about Joker is possible only thanks to Nolan, he, thanks to his Trilogy, has changed the approach to the whole genre, '' Batman Begins '' was the start of the more serious approach to the superheroe movies overall in cinema (Begins was released before Marvel movies).But of course everything about the most popular villain of all time - Joker - is promoted on a gigantic scale and in this particular case, '' The Joker'', the rest of the sheep followed it. Phoenix is a great actor, no doubt, but in my opinion the whole movie - script and direction - is full of clichés hidden under the guise of the social commentary that is another primitive truism.I will quote the Times review again, because it is excellent at exposing the shallowness and pseudo-artistic nature of this film : ''The movie's cracks - and it's practically all cracks - are stuffed with phony philosophy. Joker is dark only in a stupidly adolescent way, but it wants us to think it's imparting subtle political or cultural wisdom. Just before one of his more violent tirades, Arthur muses, 'Everybody just screams at each other. Nobody's civil anymore.' Who doesn't feel that way in our terrible modern times? But Arthur's observation is one of those truisms that's so true it just slides off the wall, a message that both the left and the right can get behind and use for their own aims. It means nothing.''Another problem of '' The Joker '' is a very chaotic structure, which means that there is not too much entertainment and pure cinema in this movie. After some time it just becomes boring mess.What was great about Nolan was that Nolan was able to combine the features of commercial, mainstream and independent film in one and what he said was authentic. He knew that such a film must also be entertainment, but he didn't limit The Trilogy to it. This accusation, which Nolan haters often repeat - that Nolan is pretentious is not true, especially in Dark Knight trilogy (because I can agree that Inception is terribly pretentious). In TDK Nolan doesn't arrogantly run away from mainstream, because he fully understood what it takes to make epic, successful superhero movie, but at the same time, he added depth to this story, by exploring both the dark and the altruistic side of Wayne / Batman and exploring, but not overdoing the Joker.Nolan Trilogy revived the genre without a doubt. We talking about real change - originality in the approach, but still entertaining. Nolan's version was finally epic tale about moral choices, tragic fate, true heroism of a man but also our weaknesses and about evil personified in Joker- evil which very often is just trivial, but still destructive as great Michael Caine/Alfred says : ''Some men just want to watch the world burn''. So no matter how many great superhero movies will come and how critics will judge them, Dark Knight Trilogy is in history books, because it changed the genre, just like Pulp Fiction changed gangster films. Before DKT, superhero movies were very schematic and mostly drab. Now they are mostly sophisticated, every director wants to do something new and original or simply more within the genre and they are all following Nolan's footsteps.Whereas Joker by Todd Philiphs is the quintessence of pretentiousness and fakeness. There is nothing authentic in this movie. It is a collection of cheap fanfiction, quotes from movies like Taxi Driver&Nolan Trilogy (even if Todd said he did it to pay tribute to Scorsese and Nolan, it turned out clumsy), poured with sauce of pop culture tricks. Phoenix battered body twists and turns on the screen, but there is no soul in this creation. Time to say goodbye to Joker, DC. You have much better villains in your stable, whose story can be fascinating to tell. The Joker ceased to be interesting long time ago. Btw, Batman has always been a more interesting character to me, because although he is a superhero, he is also the only such a popular superhero, who has so much darkness, killer impulse, but also humanity inside of him (and Bale showed all of this masterfully in Nolan trilogy). The ambivalence is fascinating here. The Joker is a wounded clown, nihilist, murderer. This story is told in the cinema several times a year. There is nothing fresh about it."
2332,"This money is so not worth time or money !
People dont leave the cinema because of a few dead people, but because is freaking sucks.The true score of this movie should be 5 not 8.9 xD"
2333,"I usually avoid rated ""R"" type movies, but this was about a beloved comic book character which I love, and was eager to see an in-depth character study of how he might have come to be. This was a great character study, but it wasn't the Joker from the comics or the movies!The Joker from the comics is brilliant, a tactician, who has no conscience but enjoys chaos and the game. This character had none of that. It was a character story about a sad, lonely, pathetic, unintelligent, mentally ill man who was abused and tortured and becomes a killer. There are other inconsistencies also, like the age of Bruce Wayne and the character of Thomas Wayne was different.The acting is great, and the character building is great. But it felt like a depressing slog at times, like the character, there was no happiness in the movie at all, with no characters shown with any morally redeeming qualities. I left feeling disturbed and depressed, but at the same time more compassion for those on the fringe of society."
2334,"This movie is a basic carbon copy of plots lifted from the movies Taxi Driver ,The King of Comedy and Network.
Act 1 features the introduction of Arthur who is playing a mentally deranged clown that is just walking the footsteps of Travis Bickle through Gotham City. You begin feeling sorry for Arthur as you quickly learn he is a poor lonely soul harboring mental problems. He has a sick mother who is the added key plot point to tie his Joker character to the Batman aka Bruce Wayne.
Act 2 Arthur slowly descends into madness while developing an interest in being a comedian combined with an obsession over a late night talk show host. Essentially The King of Comedy with a tongue in cheek twist. The talk show host is played by Robert DeNiro *wink,wink*
Act 3 is just a slow dragging transition from The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver motifs towards the final manic crescendo which echos an in your face near carbon copy lift of the Howard Beale rant and meltdown execution on live TV from the film Network. They even lifted the iconic scene from Network in which the camera pans out to several monitors inside a TV studio control room featuring random commercials, various news broadcasts and of course the man of the hour Arthur who has now emerged as the Joker
The end result ties it all together as an introduction to yet another comic book character villain. Most audiences under the age of 34 will completely vibe with this amalgamation of classic films. The current 18-34 age group tend to possess a blissful ignorance towards ""old"" movies and the general consensus among the youth of today is a total disdain for the nostalgia of anything before the year 2000. For someone who grew up in the 70's 80's and 90's this movie is nothing but a slap in the face and a gut punch to lovers of great cinema who are being inundated with banal, unoriginal film making combined with a flagrant unabashed piracy of storytelling"
2335,The worst movie from top 100 I have ever seen. Great Phoenix acting but story for losers and maniacs. It's a shame.
2336,"Being a fan of all things batman for most of my life I really looked forward to a different take on the joker origin story. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement.
As to not give anyway any spoilers to those who have still to watch it and I suggest you don't.
It's slow slow slow. You are bored bored bored with no actual storyline to keep the viewers attention until the last 30-35 minutes.
There have been comments on the extreme violence in the movie. I definitely would not describe it like that. It's not exactly a Disney production but I've seen more violence in any bond movie.
In short it's a bad movie and I was shocked that the main actors would of agreed to participate in such a terrible film. However the parts they played they did play well."
2337,"First of all let me say this movie is over-hyped and over rated, whether people say its a masterpiece for popularity reasons,because everyone else says it is because they wanted to prove critics wrong or because most of these people don't have a high enough IQ to see how mediocre it was..My perfect joker was already done by Heath Ledger. A villain with a twisted,dark,crafty,messed up mind that doesn't play by other peoples rules. Someone who doesn't conform to society and doesn't fit in,who would rather see the world burn and uses his dark mentality and twisted sense of humor to enact these thoughts and feelings out on everything and everyone. A freak who doesn't care if hes a freak and can out-wit out-do Batman at every turn. To me the person who would become joker isn't a simpleton..and sad pathetic idiot who doesn't understand the world,people or himself. This man would not be a looser who lives with his mother and struggles to get by.. An average joe who uses simple normal people vices to deal with his reality. (smoking,drink ect) Who's only unique quality is a bizarre laugh and even that was an accident that he had no say in and can't even control..No..this is not the mentality or the attitude or the way the mind breaks down.
The person who wrote this script has zero understanding of mental illness,mental disorders,psychology or human behavior. Typical Hollywood to just throw a movie together that seems as if it was written by a high school student and have everyone praise it.
The actor did a ok job just like hes done in other movies but he was way too old for the part. If Bruce Wayne was 8-10 when joker was 40+ then that means he would be fighting an 50-60+ year old man.. What a joke that is! Ha! Phoenix had that laugh down but the parts where he started laughing uncontrollably was just hard to watch;it was awkward and drawn out and not creepy,interesting or unique.. Besides that he just brought a pathetic childishness to the character (which may have been what the director wanted) but to me just served to belittle the name of Joker even more.
The score was terrible..The same loongg..drawn out...cello/violin tune..over and ovveerr! The same song multiple times..As if you couldn't hire someone better to make an actual score for the movie that was going to make you millions..The redeeming part was the delusions about the woman but to me even that was obvious it was in his head. I mean.. you stalk a woman all day and she's going to invite you in to her place?? RIGHT... I liked the scene with his old co-workers near the end but then again that's when he was really turning into Joker and the mentality and actions fit. I also thought how they made the Joker the key that started the riots and protests and that's what led to Bruce Wayne's parents dying. But since there was already an origin for that it really didn't add much to the story. And we have all seen that scene a thousand times..Also, I liked his crazy dancing and how he kept his clown behavior through the movie and that's what relates to the Joker makeup and so on which helps things come full circle.Overall i was vastly upset that they went this sloppy boo-hoo direction and i will forgot about this movie in an hour lol. It has zero lasting potential for me. In conclusion..This was written by simple people for simple people and there is nothing grand,great or imaginative about it. 4/10 at the best."
2338,To much marketing but the movie is bad. I doesn't compare with the joker from Nolan.
2339,"Far away from The Dark Knight, in a bad way. JP acting is ok, nothing amazing, too mechanic. Honestly, he didn't have much of a script to play with. Heath Ledger acting/script/philosophy is a masterpiece by comparison. The violence is meh, not that it was required but I was told that it was at least gory. If this had gore in it then Watchmen was the most violent movie ever. Shame... 3/10 and those 3 point are for JP performance."
2340,This movie is something else. Is a great movie for everyone to watch and enjoy.
2341,"This is seriously going to be a hard movie to beat, for both DC and Marvel, it deserves all of the Oscars!"
2342,"Suck and so boring movie
there is'nt story im so sad because i lost 2h with this suck movie"
2343,Joker is a mirror of our society. A movie as empty and meaningless as a stupid Neo-Nazi glorifying violence. I am disgusted.
2344,"I respect the unusual effort to try and do a movie about a comic book supervillain. But, the Joker still remains largely a cipher. Sure he's crazy, a bit tortured, and he loves anarchy. The problem is, it is all style and no substance. A movie about a crazy person being crazy isn't that interesting, enlightening or entertaining. Having a character that has traumatic brain injury as the driving cause of his delusions and schizophrenia doesn't really work. What makes the Joker an intriguing character is ability to see ourselves (just a little bit) in the character. Which is why the Joker is more interesting as a character who reached his breaking point and went totally over to the ""dark side."" Sorta like Michael Douglas in ""Falling Down."" He clearly has shades of Travis Bickle from ""Taxi Driver"" in him, but that character's descent to the dark side was MUCH more interesting.The movie lightly touches on some interesting themes, but the finale isn't earned. The self-aware soliloquy at the end isn't earned. Indeed, that awareness is contrary the back story that was developed. But, in the end it has enough style in the direction and acting to keep your attention. But, it needed a lot more than a cooky, dancing, skinny Joaquin Phoenix to make it work. Although it was a different type of movie, I still think Heath Ledger's Joker was much better."
2345,"This movie is kinda like watching a train wreck. My wife and I were on the edge of walking out the whole movie, but was just enough going on in the movie to keep us from walking out. If you see this movie, don't expect it to be an award winning movie. Sencerely"
2346,"This movie had a lot of potential, but sadly it didn't live up to it. I feel like the movie was badly directed and the storyline was just boring. Even though Joaquin Phoenix plays the Joker well, he just doesn't really fit the role. Disappointed."
2347,"There is no such a horrible Joker movie of all time.
That had to be The Clown not Joker!
After Heeth Leadger only Jared Leto is capable to acting the Joker. The Clown of Joaquin is depressing, skinny, stupid. The real Joker has to be a brainless, intelligent, not skinny. The Joker is brain, the Batman is muscular."
2348,"I watched this with a friend on Pay-Per-View and have never been more disappointed in a movie that was being hyped as something that would sweep the Academy Awards. The character devolving into to the psychopath known as The Joker was not bad at best. Some of Hollywood's best have tackled this character but none has come close to Heath Ledger's. I expected this highly touted movie to raise the bar but in the end I found myself apologizing to my friend for choosing this title,"
2349,"This movie tries to bring the character of the Joker to life and portrays his background. Although the acting is done fine, I feel this movie is much overrated and instead of realistic, it shows madness from a Hollywood point of view.First of all the story bases itself of the Freudean point of view that childhood and life experience derail the main character and leads to his actions. This is a nice romantic approach of psychology but not based in science or realism. Madness cannot be explained in many cases, and the same experience can lead to full sanity on the one and total craziness in the other person.Second, the actions of the main character are seriously disturbing and criminal. These seem to be explained from childhood trauma and abuse, and the viewer is made to sympathize. Even if life treats you bad, a movie should not give the message of a criminal being a victim. The main character should take responsibility for his life and actions, even though this may be hard.Third, this movie totally ruined the Joker character for me. This is not a realistic character in the first place but a stereotype in a comic. You can't make him realistic because that was never the intention. These persons simply don't exist in real life and how hard you try it will never be real or believable, it's only a self indulging attempt of a Hollywood actor trying to play what hollywood thinks is a disturbed person."
2350,"Everything in this movie was just perfect. Too perfect. I felt it was trying to hard to be a 'masterpiece'(that's what you call it, right?). And that's all I can say."
2351,"Victim of prolonged bullying turned insane (IMDb 8 rating), then producers decided to dress him up like a hipster clown and calls him the Joker (I wish I could give it zero rating).If this Joker robs a bank, the security will just have to wait a bit and it's gonna be the shortest bank robbery in history of bank robberies."
2352,"Joaquin Phoenix gives a good performance, but lets not get carried away here. This is not a movie about a criminal mastermind, the guy we recognize as the Joker.Arthur Fleck is a loser in every sense of the word, he lost his true identity due to physical abuse as a child, he lost his job, he lost his grip on reality, then he finally loses his s**t on live TV. This guy is not capable of masterminding anything, he cannot remember a joke without writing it down in a book. He has mental health issues and wants people to feel sorry for him, he spends all his time whinging about how mean the world is, then his solution is to go around killing people to make him feel better about himself. I have been in similar positions as him in terms of the way I have been treated by people, but I have learned from them and made better choices. For every mean and descriminating individual you will find some decent people. Class does not matter you find jerks in both the upper, middle and lower classes, you need to develop a thick skin and learn to deal with them. This movie seems to be preaching the same old drivel about the upper classes always stepping on the lower classes, I am lower class and it is just not always true.Anyway lets get back to the movie, I found the movie rather predictable in the sense that based on the characters previous actions, you can easily predict what he is going to do when certain situations arise.So in retrospect for me this movie is a good performance from Joaquin Phoenix (as expected based on his previous work) but nothing original, nothing groundbreaking nothing to warrant a 10 rating. I give it a 6.5 out of 10"
2353,"Joker is a disturbing film with a riveting performance by Joaquin Phoenix as an unstable man making a living as a clown. He lives with and takes care of his mother who is crazier than he is. Robert DeNiro is cast as a Johnny Carson type of talk show host whose biggest fan is our hero clown. The violence is over the top but is necessary, much in the way it was in ""A Clockwork Orange,""another vicious but realistic film great from 1970. Kubrick'
s masterpiece is an obvious influence on ""Joker"" but it is a worthy entry into this field of dystopian dramas. One of the ten best movies of 2020."
2354,"The genius of this movie is that it recreates the Joker character into something we haven't really seen on screen before, but it also rewrites the script of comic book films. With a fantastic portrayal from Phoenix that makes you empathize with the characters downfall while still acknowledge the evil the Joker brings.
The movie also has great cinematography and an amazing score that makes the film darker and provides a sense of unease. Great film."
2355,"For a decade, I felt like the Oscars continued to overlook the truly greatest performances and films. I'm still salty that The Social Network didn't take home the Best Picture Oscar early in the decade and that neither The Conjuring (best film of 2013) nor Gone Girl (best film of 2014) barely got any, if any, major award recognition. Those movies are true masterworks, yet the Academy continues to award sentimental, forgettable drivel that no one will be re-visiting years from now. It took the entire decade of the 2010s for me to feel like the Academy got one right and they picked a good one to do it!JOKER (2019) may have gotten negative critical reviews, but thankfully, the movie-going voices were heard and the Academy seemed to go with people who pay to enjoy movies instead of the ones paid to critique them. This movie, no question in my mind, is easily one of the best films of the decade and may very well BE the best. And it came at just the right time, sneaking in at the very end. I promise, this film will hold up! People will be breaking it down and analyzing every inch and every frame for years and years to come. Who could have ever believed that when this century started, that 20 years later, one but TWO actors would take home the ultimate prize for essaying the most scrutinized and popular character in all of media history.Make no mistake, while I do truly think that Joker is a masterpiece, it stands tall on the shoulders of one of the most remarkable performances in film history, delivered by recent Best Actor Oscar winner Joaquin Phoenix. Had Phoenix not taken home the grand prize, I would have conformed to the masses and threatened to riot! lol Phoenix was so spectacular, I'm re-evaluating whether or not Heath Ledger's Oscar back in 2008 was truly warranted, and Ledger wasn't even my favorite interpretation of Joker up to this point as I was way more entertained by Jack Nicholson in 1989's Batman and Cameron Monaghan in the late 2010s TV series Gotham. But Phoenix may be regarded as the culmination of all these fascinating interpretations.Set circa 1983 in Gotham City, Joker spins the tale of Arthur Fleck (Phoenix' character), a struggling comedian who works jobs as a clown around the metropolis. Arthur has a rare disorder which causes him to go into laughing fits at the most inappropriate times and that, along with having to take care of his physically and mentally incapacitated mother (superbly played by veteran Frances Conroy, who in my opinion deserved a Supporting Actress nomination), contributes to his severe shyness, lack of confidence, and social anxiety. To help him cope, every night Arthur watches a popular talk show hosted by Murray Franklin (brilliant performance by Robert DeNiro, who also deserved Oscar love as Supporting Actor). Arthur also gains a girlfriend during this story, his neighbor Sophie Drummond (well played by Zazie Beetz).Director Todd Phillips borrows heavily from Martin Scorcese's Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, as the star of those movies Robert DeNiro has an important part in this one, essentially essaying a version of the Jerry Lewis character from Kind of Comedy. Much like Travis Bickle, Arthur is extremely quiet and a ticking time bomb and much like Rupert Pupkin, Arthur fancies himself a comedian and dreams of being famous and much like both characters, Arthur achieves a form of infamy in Joker.Joker is basically a 100% serious, psychological exercise, not the traditional lighthearted, by the numbers, comic book movie that's been flooding movie screens for the last 40 years. Make no mistake, I still admire entertaining comic book movies such as the Christopher Reeve Superman films, the Michael Keaton Batman films, Chris Nolan's Batman Begins, Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man, and Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman, but there's an obvious uniform beat to all those movies. Most of the other comic book movies aren't even worth mentioning, but at least those I mentioned have a ton of entertainment value and re-watchability.The aesthetic of Joker brilliantly captures the early 1980s without feeling like some parody or even homage to the decade. It's simply a unique tale set in a certain era and focuses on one of the most fascinating fictional characters in history. The movie didn't win Best Picture (as it should have), but at least the Academy rightfully acknowledges Phoenix's already legendary performance. When the popular phrase ""the hype is real"" was first spoken, whoever said it was definitely thinking of Joker."
2356,There are some movies....but this one really points out with a finger....everything that people do; do it for a reason with an undertone...Madness is like gravity; all it takes a little push
2357,"I had high expectations for this film, but it completely destroyed them. This film is about The Joker, but in my opinion more than anything, it's about mental illness. It's about people who feel alone and are angry at the world. The movie shows how Arthur Fleck turns into The Joker, and it's a stunning watch, filled with incredible acting, directing, writing, music, and cinematography. A truly stunning work of art that I won't forget for a long time."
2358,"A crude adaptation of a remarkable comic character. Phoenix embodies a person with a mental illness in an extraordinary adaptation, the audience feels identify with the Joker, you feel sorry, you feel his strougle. The film is a critic to today's society, where sick person are forgotten and, moreover, expected to behave as normal people. The adaptation is not a retelling of a comic story, is an interpretation of an iconic character based on many comic stories. The sounds, the music, the reference to classic cinema and the acting is perfect!"
2359,"The trailers seemed very dark and depressing. I loved earlier Jokers and couldn't imagine Joaquin Phoenix replacing them, and certainly didn't want to see someone subjected to abuse and failures in the system. So I waited till today. It was riveting. He is an anti-hero you watch develop and root for. It's moving to watch him overcome his problems, in a terrible/beautiful way. It's sad, but fascinating. At this moment in time there are riots in other places, and you want for those people to take back control over their lives in countries where communism and dictatorship is failing them. He is an agent of Chaos."
2360,"Well, I didn't like that they changed the origin story of the main character, and within that, the origin story of Batman. I liked the originals. And, for one and a half hours, this film felt like it was ""beating a dead horse"" - Arthur is mentally ill, in a desperate time, with no more social services. And he's slipping into madness. Pause, repeat, repeat, for nearly 90 minutes. It's dark and traumatic, but its also boring, at that length. Phoenix does a good job of it, sort of combining Buffalo Bill from ""Silence of Lambs"" with the emaciated body of Trevor Reznik from ""The Machinist"", and to good effect, but no one could have kept that up in an interesting manner for that long.The last half hour is better, and lays a solid foundation for how the Joker gains power, almost despite himself. His look, and his laugh, turn more to the classic version of the character and has more of the feel of the Joker I grew up with. But, I don't know that I'd watch this again, and certainly not as often as I've re-watched ""The Dark Knight"" since it came out. This almost might have been a better movie if it wasn't about the Joker at all, and just about some how some crazy man came to be and came to power. Knock, knock..."
2361,The story line is amazing. I cried a lot during this movie. The message of this amazing piece of art is society pressure leads people to perform bad actions. I believe that joker is a victim of many people.
2362,JOAQUIN PHOENIX is GREAT !!! I hope that he will not get th oscar (small letters by reason) because it will depreciate his great performance in this GREAT MOVIE. For me 10 stars and two thumbs up definitely
2363,"I'll try to keep this brief. This is without doubt the best psychological thriller ever made. For people who have experienced MH problems or understand what it is like to feel isolated and trapped with over thinking, coupled with dillusional thoughts, the film could not have told the story any better. The links with the batman story and the empathy you feel towards joker (due to the brilliant acting and screenplay) as his life spirals out of control leaves you understanding the choices he makes in some way. Will definitely watch again soon !"
2364,"Those who complain and give bad reviews because of the ""slow pace"" or lack of action in this movie are the people in life that you should be weary of. It separates those who are willing to dive deep into life's tumultuous seas or just be happy living superficially on its surface."
2365,"Todd Phillips is a brilliant director that made an amazing adapted story with a strong situations and Joaquin Phoenix in my opinion gave us one of the best acting performances of this decade.
This movie also had an amazing,wierd,wonderful and new generation Cinematography and Production Design that seems a little bit bad to the critics.
Its really a masterpiece movie that everyone should sea."
2366,"I had great expectations of what I have read and heard and I was a little bit scared,but finally it was so much better than I could imagine. Joaquin was fucking awesome and brilliant for one more time. I think that the Oscar must be called by his name now on."
2367,"The movie is masterfully crafted, it certainly makes every movie goer reflect on what they have just seen. What they have seen is a mentally ill man, and the suffering he goes through after being marginalized by every modern institution, including the government and his family. The movie plays with the viewers emotions by making them empathize with the Arthur Fleck and then watching him make unforgivable actions.
This movie is raw and powerful. It is certainly deserving of its rating and should be watched with knowledge of what will be shown.
I highly recommend this audience to everyone above 17."
2368,"This movie is so unique, it takes you into it and make you feel every moment, every breath and a variety of emotions. It's a one-man show and that's fantastic. Joaquin deserves an Oscar for that performance."
2369,"I'll say nothing except Few words and those words are ""Can't Wait for the sequel"""
2370,"It was a pleasant surprise, excellent movie, the colors, the atmosphere and the incredible actors.
A movie that I recommend since it has a powerful message, congratulations to all who did this good work"
2371,"This is a very well written, played and directed movie. Probably Phoenix will receive an Oscar deservedly as well.
The other best thing about the movie besides the Phoenix's brilliant act it's the screenplay. Joker's story has been built so deep and persuasive that this time you put yourself into a villains' place. As all you know that's what's all about a good movie.
Thanks everyone who made this happen. We need more this kind of movies."
2372,"Raw. Dark. Brutal. Oscar.
This is phoenix' first statue garantueed. Stunning performance of a stunning character script. The dark sublime soundtrack will move you to years in the first 30 minutes of the film, but after that you will witness and feel dispare, disillusion, anger and frustration."
2373,"Gotham is in dire difficulties like New York City back in the 70's. Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a mentally unstable clown. He laughs uncontrollably in stressful times. He gets beaten and robbed by a group of youths. He gets fired from his job. He lives with his unstable sick mom (Frances Conroy) who worked for Thomas Wayne and claims him to be her ex-lover and Arthur's biological father. When Arthur is attacked by three drunken suits in the subway, he shoots them dead. Thomas Wayne is outraged by the killing of these three well-educated pillars of society and announces his campaign for the mayor's office. Arthur has a relationship with his single-mom neighbor Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz) and admires talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro).This is great character work from Joaquin Phoenix. He is one of the great actors working today. Director Todd Phillips is pounding his chest a lot and deserves some praise. I do have a couple of problems with his work. The smaller problem is the continuous shooting of Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne with her pearls. That scene has been done so many times in the past three decades. It may be better to simply suggest it with a clown walking into the alley with a gun. Don't show the shooting. Just do the sound of the shot and leave. It's all been done before and Phillips should know this. The bigger issue is setting up this world. I think Phillips expected that the audience knows this world as a given. The streets have lots of garbage. There are news reports. Phillips fails to spell it out especially if income inequality is such a big theme in the movie. It needs a Wall Street protest or two. At least, there should be a protest in front of Wayne Tower. The first clown protest against Wayne seems to come out of nowhere. The hatred of the rich needs some background. Overall, this is a great new needed voice in the comic book superhero genre which presents ground to build a new franchise on."
2374,"Great movie that will leave a lasting impression on me.
I could of sat and watched it all over again.
No words can really explain what a masterpiece this is. Up there with some of the best cinema ever produced. Only thing I'd say.... Book a ticket, sit and enjoy."
2375,There is not enough words to describe the masterpiece that this movie is. Every single scene made me feel some type of emotion and behind every look & line you could see the depth of the character. You feel what this character feels as if you're not watching a movie but living it. Truly outstanding.
2376,I can see that everyone rating the movie 1 out of 10 is non sense .. common ! Really ?!? Just to let dark knight movie better !SICK !!!!
2377,"I just watched the movie this evening and I always thought that there's no one can rock the role better than Heath ledger, but Joaquin phoenix was outstanding I couldn't believe that was just acting it was so true I felt his pain he's suffering , the laugh, the way he run , the way he analys things , the way he see others and there reaction against him... He was the best version of the JOCKER ."
2378,Y'all gotta see this one yo. Is dope and acting is dope too. So good.
2379,I think this is a masterpiece in my opinion! It's outrageously written great and great build up in the characters. I wouldn't recommend it to young viewer's though who think it's an ordinary super hero movie. Some comic book lovers might be disappointed as it doesn't follow the comic book of how joker became him self director Todd Philips wanted to make his own way which is a beautiful piece of work so some might appreciate this version. There is realistic elements that are in the movie and very controversial as well. I appreciate this movie because it shows a darker side of Society and is a massive conversation starter .
2380,"To who ever been disappointed in hollywood lately, this masterpiece will make u believe in cinemas again , its just a masterpiece, Joaquin Phoenix is an absolute living legend"
2381,"We've been waiting for this movie ever since we knew about it, and when they premiered it in Venice, Italy at the festival it got eight minutes standing ovation so I went with really high expectations, I believe the only good thing about it was Joaquin Phoenix .. almost all the actors did a great job.But the director Over dramatized in such a desperate boring way it's like "" give me the goddamn Oscar I deserve it "" but you don't ! Because the writing was awful and there was no psychological background there wasn't even original joker comic books background .. very poor quality of conversations and character development ..most of the 2 hours wasted on dancing and nothing .. we wanted more, more background more talking less dancing more sense !!It was like a live action superhero kind of movie poor writing amazing directing expect there was no action so the directing was just too desperate .."
2382,"Joker belongs to Joaquin Phoenix, there is no doubt about that, however as a movie, does it stand tall? My answer would be no.What Joker lacks is a definite construction. The focus was so much on a character that when you turn away your eyes away from the character and try to look at the movie, you are dissatisfied. It looks like the director's aim was to make Joker a victim of circumstances and there are a lot of scenes that felt forced. It felt like the narration is trying really hard to make the audience feel sympathetic towards Joker which is fine considering the fact that Joker as we know of him was actually a misfit and he tried hard to fit in the so called society. What went missing was the binding factor of the narration.
I'm not sure if anyone apart from Phoenix could have played Joker. He is breathtaking and leaves no stone unturned and is the reason why audience stuck to their seats till the end. There is no comparison, however if anyone asks to choose, I would secretly choose Heath Ledger. Again, Phoenix was excellent."
2383,"I don't usually write reviews and I don't usually watch anything comic book or superhero related, but something about the trailer of this film made me feel like I wanted to go see it.
From start to finish this film had me glued to the screen, the characters, the scenery, the story... everything.
It was a uncomfortable but interesting experience, which I would certainly recommend to anyone."
2384,"Very impressive movie. Joaquin Phoenix is acting at his best. The atmosphere is unbelievable... Even if you are not a fan of the DC universe, you will enjoy this movie.."
2385,Painful movie. The only reason some people are uncomfortable with the violence is you can taste it. It is real. And look at joker dance
2386,"I saw the movie this weekend. I had very high hopes for the movie.When I saw it, it was better than I expected. The movie deals with psychology about a man who lives in a society where rich and poor are divided. The film states the main problem:Social classes. Rich are given more importance and the poor are made to suffer and live impoverished lives. Arthur is suffering the most throughout the film.Examples of social classes are shown throughout the film:One in Particular is the train scene where three Wayne Enterprises businessmen are bullying a poor girl and this reminds the Arthur about his life. He yearns to be noticed and wants to be recognized, but Gotham never gave him a chance and mentally and physically abused him. While he did do bad things in the movie, there were many reasons that pushed Arthur over the edge:1. He was beaten up by a group of teens(I hate them) and left there crying. His boss was angry at him, just because he lost a sign?!, not because he was assaulted!?2. A guy he thought to be his friend gave him a gun for protection, but when it was revealed, he used Arthur as a scapegoat. Arthur was fired for something his friend did. This explains why he killed Randall, but spared Gary, since Gary WAS nice towards him.3. His adoptive mother Penny abused him and gave him a head injury, that caused his uncontrollable laughter.4. His favorite comedian host made fun of him by playing his laughing video. Throughout the film, Arthur wanted to be like him and imagined him liking him, but in the end, he was just like the rich, spoiled people of Gotham.Therefore, the Joker ended up getting at the end what he wanted his whole life:respect and fame. The Clowns hailed him as a hero and it put a smile on his face, even when he was imprisoned.Amazing movie! This should be made canon to a DC movie. Joaquin Phoenix delivered an amazing performance."
2387,"The acting is superb. Each scene had me captivated-Joaquin superbly gave each scene such in depth detail-I immediately watched it a second time. The directing was phenomenal. The cinematography was wonderful! The music was absolutely divine. This is a masterpiece that will be going down in history as one of the best cinematic works of art.
I truly can't say enough about it.
So excited to watch such beautiful work like this! Thank you for this art!"
2388,"I love Arthur, I loved his innocence, his kindness, his need to feel wanted. To see a man fall into depths of despair, depression, to see his imagination run wild, to see him get hurt, to see him try so hard but get knock after knock - This film pulled out every emotion, it's raw, it's sad, it's hard to watch, yet it's so beautiful how it's played out. The music is so powerful, the camera angles are perfect. Joaquin Phoenix is incredibly beautiful in his acting, I'm in awe of him in this movie. Mental illness is real, it's everywhere. If you don't understand what mental illness is, watch this movie. Quite possibly the best movie I've ever seen."
2389,"One of the best movies that i had the pleasure of seeing in the last few years.
The movie takes you to an unforgetable, shocking and emotional journey inside the mind of the Joker.
Oscar winning preformance without a doubt!!!!"
2390,"I watched JOKER todayNo, it doesn't deserve OSCAR
Instead the OSCAR deserves JOKER
What a movie. Joaquin phoinex nailed it with perfection!"
2391,"After seeing the movie I was in total disbelief for like ten minutes. The movie is really good, but the acting by Joaquin Phoenix must be best I've ever seen in my life. It was perfect. He really makes the Joker come to life."
2392,"This movie is haunting, to say the least. It is not for the faint of heart. That being said, it is probably the single most powerful piece of cinematic art I've ever seen. The storyline, cinematography, facial expressions, symbolism, acting: all perfect as far as I'm concerned. Take a dark look into how abandoned people only fall deeper into abandonment as a family, community, and society neglects to acknowledge their suffering. If this movie doesn't force you to self-reflect-- both in relation to the joker and those who treated him poorly-- nothing will."
2393,"I had to create an account just to write this review. This is how much I liked the movie, and Pheonix's acting. Best movie I've watched in theatre."
2394,"I would really like to understand why this film is rated sooo high. Nothing took place until the last 20-25 mins. I kept looking at my watch because it was rather boring. Now Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic as Joker, but you couldn't really see that until the end of the movie. I would like to see what he could really do with this role. And to compare him to Heath Ledger, I don't know. Heath Ledger was phenomenal, he was so raw, and he put everything into that role."
2395,"What a great movie and what a performance of Joachim Phoenix.
People who don't like this movie please next time go to a CGI packed no brainer Marvel movie because this movie is totally different.
I didn't even see it as an superhero movie because there aren't any in here.
There is so many potential in the Joker character and Phoenix did the job so damn good that I hope there will be a sequel."
2396,"This film has the criteria to be the first film with a main character that can stand alone and increase the element of suspense without the need of multiple character crosses.Think of it for a moment, There is no a single scene that will make you question the characters choices. And man... the way they developed the Joker here is magnificent, with a mind-blowing performance from Joaquin and a great cinematography... this is by far the best movie I have seen in years !10/10"
2397,"This movie packs some of the best performances we have seen in years. The script is great, dialogues, sound, cinematography and what not, all just outstanding. But i am surprised to see such a low metascore. Why are the critics not happy with it? I heard it somewhere that the critics are not happy with the violence in the movie. Well this movie has less than 10% voilence in the last Tarintino movie which was completly pointless as far as the story goes. But yet ""Once Upon a Time in Holywood"" scored so well in metascore. Compared to that, this movie should have scored an above 85 in metascore. Are the critics sold to Disney to sabotage any DC/WB based movie?"
2398,"I love this film so much! I saw this film and this is seriously one of the best films ever!!! This movie is perfect! I'm definitely gonna buy it on blu-ray! Everything about this film is just perfect and is the acting! Joaquin Phoenix needs to continue portraying as the Joker in the rest of the films where they will have the Joker because Phoenix is the TRUE JOKER. He is a huge difference than the other Joker actors in the past. He is so much better than anyone else! This film and Joaquin Phoenix are so amazing, so brutal, so dark, so thriller, so entertaining, so shocking, so watchable, so enjoyable!!! I rate this film a 10 out of 10! I'm gonna be very upset if they dont give Joaquin Phoenix an oscar because he deserves it!!! He is an incredible actor!! I'm also gonna be upset if they dont continue using Joaquin Phoenix to portray as the Joker in the films because he is the only actor who does a perfect job as the Joker! GIVE JOAQUIN PHOENIX AN OSCAR! CONTINUE FILMS WITH JOAQUIN PHOENIX AS THE JOKER!"
2399,"As you've probably heard by now, Joker is a comic book film unlike anything we've ever seen before. It chooses to focus on it's iconic lead character in a very down to earth, dark and twisted story that mostly stays far away from any sort of storyline found in the Batman comics. This film follows Arthur Fleck, a failed stand-up comedian who slowly descends into madness and revolts against the world around him.
Joaquin Phoenix is incredible in this. He portrays Arthur in with so many subtle movements and expressions that makes Arthur feel like a real person. Phoenix even stamps his own name on Joker's laugh, ensuring it stands out from everyone else. He's in every single scene, and he eats up every minute of the runtime.
This character is incredibly complex, and every scene portrays his descent into madness. It will be a film that will likely require multiple viewings to catch every detail. The film can be slow but every scene is important to Arthur's breakdown and by the end of the film, you will see a character that has become completely full circle. It's incredible to watch in a movie that will be remembered for a very, very long time."
2400,"Juaquin Phoenix was riveting, intense, believable, depressing, and wonderful. He WAS Arthur Fleck. Definitely not for children. Very deep and makes you stop to think about how you truly treat people."
2401,"When I saw the trailer, I knew this movie would be something else. But actually, I wasn't ready for THAT. This isn't just a movie, it's a complete masterpiece. Here, you understand how the joker became this evil. It's heart-breaking, emotional, whatever you want but you can't stay marble in front of this."
2402,"This is really a masterpiece of cinematography.
And definitively the best acting performance I've ever seen."
2403,"Acting, cinematography, sound design, and the scenario itself is phenomenal. This film is a triumph. Joaquin Phoenix deserves to win an Academy Award for this tbh."
2404,Amazing acting and storyline. One of the best movie
2405,"First thing first i waited for this movie to be aired as soon as possible.Indeed the producer's read my mind and released it 2 earlier in our country (india).To my expectations the movie went above the expectations. Phoenix rocked the whole jokers character itself. The story of the movie is satisfying for the audience and indeed the dialogue, comic timings, cinematography, score and all other.
Movie starts with joker already getting a bad day. The story becomes more and more intense as the movie rolls on. We can feel the tense and the good thing about the movie is its Gotham city's atmosphere.. Its chilling and interesting to watch the development of jokers character till the second half.
And oh dear the 2nd half of the movie is mesmerizing and top of the game.
Goosebumps all over when phoenix becomes joker .
The dance and laughs we can't miss .
Everytime joker laughs there is something for the audience
Also the timing of the laughs is perfect.To sum up the movie is itself a masterpiece with phoenix at his performance of all time.
Go and see it yourself and be glad like me"
2406,The best drama/dark dark dark movies ever 10/10 . And this man should win an Oscar
2407,Joaquin phoenix acting is brilliant. The cinematography is beautiful. The storyline very captivating and feels so real and raw. There is no weak points in this film. 2 hours full of brilliant scenes.
2408,"Firstly, this movie is not for the youngsters and earns it's R - rating.Joker is a deep and meaningful physiological thriller. Beautifully Directed and the Cinematography was simply amazing considering it takes place in a slummed out city. The Music leaves you feeling almost like you are watching a suspenseful horror movie.
Phoenix is just masterful in his role and could easily be a contender for a number of awards.I'm afraid the Heath Ledger Joker has been well and truly succeeded as the Best Joker.10/10..."
2409,The best thing about this movie is first to get all the hype with this kind of challenging role and screenplay and then actually live up to all the expectations.
2410,"The acting was tremendous, and the storyline was perfect. Sometimes when a story is told about a famous character, certain elements take away from our familiarity of that character in the past. What we all know of The Joker from Batman is preserved in this movie. They didn't try to change him and his personality, the built upon what was already there and loved by us fans! Thank you Directors and Producers!!!"
2411,"I am so convinced of the character Phoenix portrayed that he has become synonymous, in my mind, to the Joker, for life.I never thought Heath Ledger would get dethroned, but sorry, my late brother, you'll have to step down.However hard I tried finding a way to knock off a star from my rating, impossible. This was a perfect picture from start to finish.I kept thinking that his make up wasn't doing justice for the ""Joker"", but then remembered, hello, this is the making of, so of course...I'm just glad he will finally win his long-awaited Academy Award."
2412,Its so good I cry after film ilove it ihope to see it
2413,"Pheonix took he role of Joker to a whole new level but I would also like to add that it could have been better if they had compacted and reanalyzed the story well. Showing the same effective scenes two times was not needed. Other than these things, movie really specified another level of story"
2414,"Set in the early 1980's, working clown Arthur Fleck(Joaquin Phoenix) a man who is heavily medicated, cause he is suffereing from mental illness, dreams of being a famous stand up comic, but his world begins crumble, will his sanity be lost, and his identity is only seen through his joker make up?
I get this is a totally different Joker movie, very different from the DC universe movies we have seen already. Phoenix is quite chilling to watch, as you watch him lose his mind. The movie borrows heavily from such films like Taxi Driver(1976) and The King of Comedy(1983). Robert De Niro is pretty memorable has Murray Hamilton, a Johnny Carson like talk show host. Phoenix really delivers a great performance, you can tell he became the character when the camera was rolling. One problem I had they showed the death of Bruce Wayne's parents, which I felt was not needed, better to be hinted at it instead, and the end keeps dragging itself out, to the point you'll be telling yourself end already. But other than that a good film."
2415,"It is a very daring movie, to say the least. Excellent performances and exceptional movie overall. 'Masterpiece' is how I would describe it. Some viewers will be left feeling uneasy. What a character! Todd Phillips has done justice to this version of Joker, and I'm glad! Please don't let children watch this."
2416,"Ignore the biased negative media coverage, this film is great, it is exactly the kind of cinema we need in 2019, intelligent, challenging, gripping, and above all, rewarding. It is a solid script with a solid pay off that will not disappoint you. It's not a blockbuster cookie-cutter made with the primary objective of making as many billions as possible, it's actual art which is becoming rare in cinemas these days. Joaquin Phoenix totally knocks it out of the park."
2417,Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. It's a great movie.
2418,"Has to be the greatest individual performance, and also backed by equally good background score."
2419,"This movie makes you ansious, uncomfortable and concerned like a good drama/thriller. It really made me feel like i was watching breaking bad again, in some parts. Phoenix does a great job playing this character, he gives life to the joker again."
2420,"When you watch the movie you don't only feel the darkness and atmosphere, but also live inside that and walk out of cinema with mixed feelings, not sure how to feel about it."
2421,"Shame on all the critics who gave this a thumbs down... this is the best movie/acting for this decade.. .. you guys are getting paid to be critics.. .
shame on you.. .. the theater that I watched in .. we all applaud and stayed till the credits are done.. .. haven't seen this happen in a long time.. .. if Joaquin does not win the Oscar for this.. .. then they should stop doing this nonsense.. .. AMAZING MOVIE.. .."
2422,"This movie is the first to actually compel me to begin writing reviews. First of all, yes, this movie is great, but I wanted to give it a fair score unlike what it's been given by the mainstream. It is as if the majority of the people writing such reviews haven't even seen the movie themselves. No this movie does not invoke or persuade anarchist violence, nor is it meant to be the happy/feel-good type that many super hero movies portray. This is a movie of the devolution of man, who happens to fit into the comic book fiction world of Gotham. Don't bring your children to see this, it is not meant for them - it is meant for those mature enough to understand an amazing character study that Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix place on the big screen. This movie was one of the best cinematic experiences I've had in years, one that kept me engrossed from beginning to end without falter. Please do yourself a favor and see this movie, and don't read the critics' reviews. They're just degenerates looking for a big hit headline. Joker is 10/10, up there with the likes of Taxi Driver."
2423,"I knew this film would be great as soon as I've heard of it and the main character - Joaquin Phoenix...jusy wow!
So believable, he makes you relive the pain he goes through and feel his emotions.
Can't wait for Oscars! 🙌🏼"
2424,"Not much else to say about this. Watch it, love it it. Greatest movie of the year."
2425,"An excellent film.
Wasn't sure what to expect with the way they were approaching this but I was very happy with the outcome, breathtaking the music was fantastic.
I would recommend this to anyone even if they weren't comic book fans."
2426,"Outstanding climax , legendary acting and breath taking moments . This was a cinematic brilliance !"
2427,What a movie.Loved it 😍😍😍. OSCAR is waiting for Joaquin phoenix and the movie joker.Heath Ledger Joker legacy is achieved now.
2428,This movie gave great depth into the mind of one the worlds favorite super villains. Heath would be proud!
2429,"I've never seen a movie (with the possible exception of The Force Awakens and The Incredibles 2) to be as hyped as this with both good and bad things emanating from that. Ever since the first trailer came out in April, I've been waiting to see it. I knew that this wouldn't be like any other comic book movie I'd seen up to that point (I've yet to see Logan and Watchmen). And indeed, from the trailers it looked like Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, both of which also star Robert De Niro. Even still, Joker perfectly encapsulates everything about the character. The Clown Prince of Crime, the Jester of Genocide, the Harlequin of Hate. The movie gives a believable and more than fitting backstory for the Joker. If not than you could look at it as the story of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) just an unfortunate and deluded man with aspirations of being a comedian who endured one too many kicks in the teeth. It is a comic book movie but more dark and gritty than any I've ever seen, including The Dark Knight. I often don't like the way that DC assumes that since the Dark Knight trilogy the only path to success is by way of the dark route, without actually taking the time to do it right. Joker does it right. And with an R rating it's not for kids."
2430,Watched it last night and I cant stop thinking about this film .. Here's a thought on why you should not miss this Master Piece ..Joker is a film about SOCIETY being unfair to misfits ..And ironically SOCIETY cheering up for the PERFECTION of Joaquin Phoenix acting and Directing of Tod Philips and ignoring the misfits in real life just goes to proof that the cycle will forever continue ..
2431,"The hype is real ladies and gentlemen, this is easily one of the finest films I have ever watched. This isn't just another CGI fueled movie with a superficial plot and big explosions trying to make up for it.
This isn't a mindless superhero, ahem, super villain movie. This is a deep and disturbing character study of what could happen to a person under highly excruciating, albeit, very realistic circumstances. To say that Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Arthur Fleck was superb, would be an understatement. He has a way to convey his character's emotions on a level that will make you feel for him and equally disturb you. This isn't your typical ""villain-falls-in-a-tub-of-acid"" origin story, and the fact that society or lack thereof can have such an impact and break a man in such a way, makes it that much more terrifying to watch.
""Joker"" is sure to provoke some interesting talks long after leaving the theater. A must watch."
2432,For the first time an antagonist makes sense. The portrayal of the character is phenomenal it leaves a true grit inside our heads.Joaquin Phoenix is surreal in the character. If he doesn't win Oscar id be laughing as he does.
2433,Just go watch it. The cinematography & acting will blow you away.
2434,"The viewer follows the life of the mentally ill Arthur Fleck where he struggles to stay sane in a society that has collectively cast him out.
The intricacy of Arthur's progressing insanity is one that will be remembered for years to come. The film is raw and remarkably truthful about the difficulties the mentally ill face in society. Arthur struggles to overcome his ""negative thoughts"" and become a successful stand-up comedian, while also discovering the truth of his mental illness and origin as well.
As the film progresses you realize that you're watching Arthur slowly lose his mind, despite his efforts to remain sane and reach for help. This is created in a heart breaking yet beautiful way, where you are left understanding Arthur and the decisions he comes to make by the finale.I loved this film and it may easily be my favorite of all time. The cinematography, the writing, the acting, and everything is damn near perfection. I am amazed on how Joaquin Phoenix was able to carry the film on his own and deliver such an incredible performance. Arthur is the epitome of character development in this film and I don't think that alone does this movie justice.
By the end of the film I was left with my jaw wide open; I just couldn't believe how the intricacy on Arthur's inner battles led so smoothly into the creation of the Joker. Everything in this film is original and I encourage everyone to go watch it. You might want to keep the kids at home for this one though.
If I could give it higher than a 10 I would."
2435,"Joaquin is unbelievably amazing. It links the DC Universe together so well. Joker is the reason Batman is alive!
It's hard not to compare it to The Dark Knight but you have to realise this is a kind of coming of age story.
Nothing will compare to Heath Ledger. But Joaquin did a good job of linking the two."
2436,"In a year full of mediocre films and some mediocre comic book films, Joker is a HUGE breath of fresh air. Joker is a fantastic film and a fantastic comic book film. Although the film is great, there are a small handful of issues. Unfortunately, most of those issues are spoiler related so I can't talk about them. The one I can talk about is that the film does sometimes borrow a little too much from the films it is inspired by, Taxi Driver (1976) and The King of Comedy (1983). If you have seen either of those films and watch Joker then you will know what I am talking about. Other than that and my spoiler related issues, the film is almost perfect. Joaquin Phoenix does a phenomenal job as the Joker. You can barely recognize that it is him because he just disappears into this role. The way Joaquin Phoenix shows this slow downfall of his character is incredible. Robert De Niro also does a fantastic job with his limited role. He's cold, calculating, and manipulative and it's perfect. The sequence of events that the film portrays is perfect. It doesn't quickly get to the ""Joker"" but spends most of the film showing the slow downfall of his character. The film does this to perfection. This film is incredibly dark. There are multiple moments in the film that your jaw just drops at what happens. The film uses violence to its advantage. The scenes where it is used in adds to the already huge amount of tension that has been built up which leads me to my next point, Joker is incredibly tense. There are multiple moments where events are slowly building up and you are just on the edge of your seat waiting for the climax of that scene and when it happens, it feels super satisfying. The score for this film is amazing also. Hildur Guðnadóttir has so many outstanding compositions that adds to the tension and gives us an insight into Arthur's mind. The cinematography is surprisingly really good. It always provides a way to show us how Arthur is feeling while also getting other necessary shots. Joker is a film that has to be experienced on its own. Ignore the controversy behind it and try not to pay too much attention to the critic reviews. You have to see the film and depending on how you feel the film portrays issues like violence and mental illness will determine if you like it or not. Overall, Joker is exactly what comic book films needed with a breathtaking performance from Joaquin Phoenix and an interesting, dark, and realistic approach into an iconic character. I give Joker a 9.5/10."
2437,"Audience clapped after the film.
It's worth it!
:-)"
2438,"A cinematic masterpiece. Absolutely 10/10. A movie that takes you in roller coaster of mixed feelings and expresses a logical way of forming evil in humans.
Joaquin Phoenix should get an Oscar, a golden globe, an Olympic gold medal,a Nobel prize, a ballon d'or, Knighthood, a champions league winner medal and a presidential medal of freedom for his performance as the joker."
2439,"This Is the best movie I've seen this year, everything from the story,soundtrack,acting was absolutely world class and even if Heath Ledger was alive today I have no doubt he'd be proud of this masterpiece of a movie and most certainly Joaquin phoneix's Oscar worthy performance."
2440,"Amazing acting,amazing performance.
This movie one of the best comic movies i ever watched."
2441,"Let me start with how amazing Phoenix portrays Joker. I see a lot of negative reviews on the news and online, to be honest I don't believe these viewers are watching it the way its intended to be. Its a dark gritty story of how Joker became Joker, what people are calling political is simply the view the Joker has on the world.I am really impressed with the writing to filming the acting just everything, I've never sat in a cinema that's been more quiet than the Joker to how immersed everyone was. Absolutely brilliant.Whatever your views are watch this ignore all bad reviews and please find out for yourself. World class."
2442,"Never Did I thought there would be a redefining role for this character after Ledger. Phoenix puts his heart and soul into the psyche of a man who has little to lose, who's constantly at odds with what the society considers Norm.He tries to life by its rules, only to constantly find his back to the wall. Abused, Put down, Shaken up, Underappreciated.
It is only when he sheds his tattered concepts of morality, does the world start making sense to him. and his ascension spells chaos to the world.Joaquin Phoenix is notorious telling us stories not only through dialogue but also his Body language. And here we see, how as the strings holding him tied are cut one after the other, the timid, unsure and pitiable Arthur transforms into this confident reality he built for himself. Into what he sees as his destiny.There is no doubt that the movie is a vehicle for the character study of Arthur Fleck's descent into Madness. or as he sees it, his 'enlightenment'. the world, the characters, the narrative, even the colors and environment are set in a way to accentuate it.Make no mistake, This is not a Marvel brand of 'family Friendly' entertainment. Definitely not one you take the kids to. The actions and themes explored are chilling in how close they are to reality. They are scenes you cannot/should not be seeing, but will regardless. And it does an excellent job of making you squirm in your seats. As it should.The story towards the end overstays its welcome a bit. Without spoiling much, there were some parts where i thought 'this is when & how the story should wrap' but it kept pulling on. And at least one scene related to Bruce's origin seemed more like shoehorn. All in all, go and watch for Phoenix's Spellbinding performance and story with a heart of Dark Depravity."
2443,"That's how good Joker actually is. We cried in Batman Begins and BVS on the death of Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne but In Joker we rejoiced their deaths. The creation of Joker is certainly a journey which if it stays fictional its a bliss but if it happens in reality its a curse.
I have to say I have never rejoiced over an Antagonist killing civilians or father of Bruce Wayne.ha Damn I loved the movie"
2444,"There's nothing that can describe this MASTERPIECE
This movie is going to be taught in schools
And that performance by joaquin is phenomenal
By far the best movie in the last 5 years
The oscar is only a matter of time
Easily,,Best actor in a leading role and Best movie"
2445,"Dark. Unsettling. Leaves you disturbed and wanting more! Definitely the direction DC needs to take. Joaquin is amazing as Joker! It's paced well and beautifully shot, will definite watch again!"
2446,"""Joker"" is a movie that features tons of well-done, entertaining and well acted scenes... but it's a bit disappointing for me in terms of story and pacing.Let me state the obvious: Joaquin Phoenix delivers an amazing performance throughout this picture. He does capture the essence of the character that the movie displays onscreen and every line he delivers is done so in a brilliant manner.The cinematography and camerawork is also pretty solid and the color palette makes this film look darker and more grounded than most DC outputs. Overall, the presentation of ""Joker"" blends well with the tone and it's a satisfying departure from other Todd Phillips' movies, which are more directed towards the comedy genre.However, as excited I was for this movie, I can't stop to think how much more I wanted out of the movie after it ended. The pacing is not terrible by any means, but often times it seems as though some scenes felt unnecessary. It's accurate to call this a character-driven film, but even movies like these may suffer from sequences that could have been cut and nothing would have been lost.The insertion of the Wayne drama and how they connected to the Joker character was not a particularly interesting part for me, but it got even worse in the end when they show once again the origin of Batman. It was really redundant and it takes us back to my previous point about some scenes being useless.I'm sure the movie wanted its audience to feel sympathy towards the main character and they successfully did that, but it was only because the secondary/background characters were nothing more than stereotypical props who, for no reason at all, just think it's intelligent to start beating somebody up with no concern of what consequences they might face. All those extras who beat up Joaquin Phoenix's character in the beginning of the film are exactly like that - clichéd props. There's no real reason to not side with Arthur because everyone around him treats him like garbage in a very over-the-top way.Those issues aside - the ""Joker"" movie is a solid entry in the DC track record and it might change my score upon rewatch, but I certainly wasn't fond of some elements of it.6/10."
2447,Joaquin Phoenix delivers one of the best performances I've ever scene.One of the best movie ever.
2448,"The movie left me at awe. All the hypes and the praisings, this movie deserves it all. Joaquin Phoenix's acting is just on the next level. See the movie yourself for an emotional rollercoaster that will leave your overwhelmed and speechless."
2449,"Best movie ever. Wonderful acting, great direction and the best story you could ever ask for this legendary character. Thought provoking. Another movie added to my favourite list. Unforgettable for a long time."
2450,"Never a movie like this that brought me to feel how an already disturbed man became a legendary villain that we know. I would give it a 10 out of 10, but I will save the 10 for another movies that might beat this one. But for now, yeah this is one of the best movies out there... Go ahead watch it and enjoy the journey...."
2451,"What an experience it was.....acting, story, direction, screenplay, everything about this movie was upto the marks....heath ledger would be so proud of this act.....just wow"
2452,"This is actuall joker be like.. Just like ledger playing his role as joker.. Joaquin nailed it, perfect role for him.. But if you want to watch this.. Don't bring your child to seeing this.."
2453,"After sitting through more trailers than ever before, I was hopeful that the Joker movie would give me a fun insight into the anarchy famed prince of crime. Instead, I sat through two hours of boredom and dissatisfaction discussing with my company more than once if we should leave the theatre. Foremost, this movie demonizes mentally ill individuals, who are statistically more likely to be victims of violent crime than to commit them. And while you can argue that the Joker has always been an unhinged character, I have never seen the character so blatantly portrayed as incapable and schizophrenic. There is a lack of mastermind and a focus on illness to the point where the main character actually writes out ""mental illness"" and it is highlighted in frame. The Joker in this movie could never face a Batman, and yet, he comes face to face with Bruce Wayne so many years before becoming his arch nemesis in a juvenile and disturbing way, inasmuch that he is inadvertently responsible for the death of the Wayne parents in the most contrived and convoluted way possible. Although in this narrative you feel they deserve it as they are seen as nothing but Jeff Bezos/Donald Trump (the movie tries very hard to parallel our political climate in a way that is incoherent and distressing) stand ins. There is also a noticeable absence of the traditional flair that one would attribute to anything Joker related. I have this film two stars. One for Phoenix's outstanding ability to act so well that I felt pity, and ultimately disgust for the main character (although the disgust could be more from how much I disliked the film). And the second for a short scene wherein the Joker empties his entire refrigerator to climb in and enjoy sitting in the darkness which is exactly what I would have preferred to watching the film. Lastly, because of the recent climate and the shooting in Colorado, this film made me feel unsafe. At one point during a quiet scene the theatre door opened and every head turned in alarm. The person who was responsible for Colorado is the exact type of person this was made for... people looking for the world to take pity on them because they feel invisible. And this film will vindicate these feelings because it is not until the end that we see this ""hero"" is nothing more than an unreliable narrator. I deeply love DC, but this film fell flat, felt boring, and most importantly for me was out of character for what could truly have been a deep and meaningful backstory."
2454,Can't Describe it..... Sometimes u Bury that Part of yourself so Deeply that u have to be Reminded It's even There at all
2455,"Do I love this movie or hate it? I was extremely disturbed as I watched the main character, Arthur Fleck, being abused, laughed at, and ignored as his mental health spiraled downwards into a very dark abyss. What made the movie more disturbing was that this could happen to anyone under an unfortunate set of circumstances. As Fleck (the Joker) became more an more unbalanced, the mental health care system was portrayed as virtually non-existent. But perhaps this is closer to the truth in real life. This movie was a very dark view of the mental health care system, and a warning of what can, and will, happen if we do not respect the mental health care system and the people who work within it. I felt the entire movie was done in poor taste, and yet I was further disturbed by the number of audience members who actually laughed at Arthur Fleck and his unfortunate circumstances. It is a grim view of how many people still view those with mental health issues.**If you have friends of family who suffer from mental health issues, please DO NOT let them see this movie!!"
2456,This is a bleak and very overyhyped movie. The acting was excellent though.
2457,"Wish Heath could have played this role, Joaquin filled his shoes flawlessly"
2458,I always thought the godfather was the best movie i had seen but the new Joker movie with Joaquin is just amazing.
2459,The acting was good. But the story was not. Not for a film about Batman's arch nemesis. This was a movie that could have been about anyone with a mental illness and family troubles who gets bullied and picked on and goes off the deep end and they really failed with it. I expected more. So disappointed that I sat through the whole thing. Glad I didn't pay for it.
2460,Thomas Wayne was a good guy and this show makes him look bad.
2461,Just as crap as Birdman. So slow it was like watching paint dry.
2462,"Take Taxi Driver and King of Comedy (and maybe a touch of Falling Down), mash them together with only a basic idea of what made those movies good, and use a popular comic book villain as the lead in order to get far more recognition for the film than it would have gotten otherwise and you have Joker.Joaquin Phoenix may have acted the hell out of the title role, but it doesn't change the fact that Joker is at best a pale imitation of far better films that actually knew how to make a point with their social commentary.Phoenix's performance and the cursory Scorsese like visual aesthetic may have tricked others into seeing depth where there isn't any... but not me. I really wish I hadn't wasted my time with this one."
2463,Just don't see this. This is not a movie. Don't waste your time.
2464,"I think this is the worst film I've ever seen in the cinema. So tedious and boring. Says nothing of any worth about any of the subjects it raises and the lionisation of Joker is ridiculous. He is a joke, not a hero. His mental illness and treatment by others is something we should empathise with and yet he's a loser, he is an A hole who we are meant to feel sorry for?? he's not scary and he kills with no consequences. The people that then support him and cheer him on - he's doesn't even engage with them. He says nothing to them, not a word. There is no message and if I hear that laugh again I might, well, let's not go there. This film is so disappointing and just awful. I hate it more than anything I've seen in the cinema in 40 years."
2465,"Really expected more from it. Character development was great, but when it got interesting the film ended. Quite disappointing"
2466,"This is first movie I watched and review on this site. Well, watch this movie if you have absolutely little else to do. I found it very boring, longish, and at the end of the movie in theatre I was about to fall asleep. This boring it was. I mean people, you better entertain yourself watching washing machine going, two hours straight. Would not recommend this movie to anyone. It is just boring as hell."
2467,It has absolutely good character every one loved but why to watch something that can make you sad and have bad influence in your life . It is good to watch some bad comedy movie rather joker . Dancing in weird ways does this make a master piece unfortunately no 😂
2468,"This is going to change the landscape of comic book movies. A Dark, twisted, psychological thriller by Todd Phillips.Once in a lifetime performance by best actor of this generation #JoaquinPhoenix"
2469,"Joker is defenantlythe best written movie I've seen this year, with an oscar worthy performance by Joaquin phenoix joker takes my spot as movie of the year, maybe even decade and shows that theres still potential in cinema"
2470,I don't like this movie . total disappoint with the story .
2471,"Really can not see what the fuss was about with this movie, especially compared to some movies which are only receiving 5 or 6 stars 😂"
2472,"Where is the narrative?
Imagine if this film wasn't associated with Batman, how would you feel about it...."
2473,"This movie has already been done, and much more successfully. 'Nightcrawler' set the standard for lonely-sociopath-craves-recognition movies and 'Joker' comes nowhere near its impact.
While 'Nightcrawler' avoids creating any sort of sympathy for the character, 'Joker' dares us NOT to feel sorry for him. It can't (or won't) go the extra mile and simply create a character with no redeeming features, which is exactly what the Joker should be. Instead, it insists on pulling at our heart strings by filling the first half of the movie with endless scenes of sorrow and misery for the character.
It is nothing more than a sugar-coated vision by the director, and Phoenix, while doing admirable work with what little he was given,just comes across as pathetic and haphazard. Almost like each scene was created on the spot."
2474,The acting is great but the movie is not. I have difficulty understanding the point of this movie. 2+ hours of self pity? How did this movie make a billion? There's no story. No character development. Really fell flat for me. Highly disappointed after all of the hype.
2475,"I was so sad after watching the movie because I had such high expectations. I absolutely love Joker in the Batman movies, in the cartoon, even in suicide squad. Joaquins acting is outstanding, but the movie is nothing like I expected. 75% of the movie portrays how depressing his life is, which made the movie feel like it was going on forever. It was unnecessary. The last 15-20 minutes was really good, because that's when the action started coming in.For more fancy movie watchers it may be a masterpiece, but for a simple Batman fan it was just boring."
2476,"There is no reason why Phoenix's elaborately backstoried Joker shouldn't be as powerful as Heath Ledger's mysterious, motiveless, originless Joker in The Dark Knight. But at some stage the comic-book world of supervillaindom has to be entered, and Ledger was more powerful because he wasn't weighed down with all this realist detail and overblown ironic noir grandeur, and he wasn't forced to carry an entire story on his own. This Joker has just one act in him: the first act. The film somehow manages to be desperately serious and very shallow.Final rate : Masterpiece."
2477,"Whilst the acting was fine (maybe not subtle enough to be great) it wasn't a particularly gripping film and made me wonder what the hype was about. Maybe unique in trying to introduce a comic book viewing audience into a less action packed and slightly more serious film. I guess such audiences may describe it as 'mature' or 'deep' but an adult with moderately broad movie tastes certainly wouldn't. Maybe worth a watch, but don't go out of your way."
2478,"I went to see this in the cinema and wasn't blown away as many seem to be. I think this is one of those cases where people jump on the bandwagon and praise a movie mostly because it's been receiving a lot of praise. I didn't see that much value in it.The movie isn't bad at all, and Phoenix does a very good job as Joker, but that's about it. The movie doesn't really offer anything new that would be noteworthy and the tone of the entire movie is very dark and sad and desperate. These are the conditions Joker finds himself in, which isn't unexpected in the least, but then at some point in the movie we find out that Joker has lost his mind because he was imagining some of the things we had seen. This, to me at least, defeats the purpose of the setting of the movie (a city in ruin), because it's revealed that Joker is insane and the woman that adopted him was insane, as well.So, the grim landscape, garbage everywhere, the economy, Joker's sad life, all of this is meant to show us how a monstrous society created one of the most well-known villains of all time. But then the movie also tells you ""Oh btw, he's crazy whatever which way you turn it."" This, then, leads me to think the entire movie is overdone and certain aspects don't make too much sense or are not really needed. Because for me personally, it would have been more chilling if Joker had been living in normal conditions and his insanity still shone through and made him what he is. That would have struck more cords as it would emphasize the aspect of the Joker that makes him what he is - his lack of mental health.I suppose it's inevitable to compare this to Ledger and The Dark Knight. Not doing this to wind anyone up, as I can see many people are passionate about claiming Phoenix's superiority over Ledger for this role. I think Ledger is still unmatched and I don't think this is particularly close. The reason for this is that Ledger's Joker seems far more intelligent and his lunacy appears more real and more pronounced, whereas I have the feeling Phoenix's Joker is timid, shy, afraid and confused and ultimately snaps due to a mixture of frustration and insanity. But I don't feel as if Phoenix's Joker is a character that can/will develop into Ledger's Joker, it seems like a big leap and I see a lack of some common traits between the two. In a sense, I think this is an attempt not to tell us the story of how the Joker came to be, but to create a different Joker, which in the end turns out to be an inferior character to the Joker that made the supervillain famous.Also, for me The Dark Knight develops the character of the Joker more than the movie centered around Joker, which is saying something. The most striking part of the character for me (in Batman) were the nuances and subtleties of what Ledger showed us, just small details that add to the tone of the character. Ledger had this ability to show at the same time how his character was incredibly intelligent and devious and also crazy and just generally unstable and messed up. This is not present in Phoenix's portrayal. There are no scars on the Joker's mouth, there's no ""Why so serious?"". What little we got about the character's backstory in The Dark Knight was more telling and more chilling than the entire plot of Joker."
2479,"Everything it's sick, real, sad, punchy
Since I grow up, I never see the movie like this
And I think this one will change the world"
2480,"Joaquin Phoenix delivers a stunning performance as Arthur Fleck, AKA Joker, in this jaw-dropping masterpiece that will be talked about for years to come. It proves to be more than just a comic book villains backstory. 'Joker' meticulously captures the gradual decline of one man's mental health, and shines light on the subject of mental health in general. There are points where you begin to sympathize with the madman. Despite some of the terrible acts he happily commits, you find yourself rooting for him which leads you to question your own morality. The world has viciously beaten this man down, and this is only the beginning of his retaliation.This is, without a doubt, Phoenix's best performance so far. He carries the entire movie flawlessly, and leaves you with a lot to talk about afterwards. The brilliant method actor ensures that people will feel this characters pain, and does not disappoint for one second. Robert De Diro, another brilliant method actor, gives a fine performance as Aurthor Fleck's favorite comedy talk show host, Murray Franklin. Though he's only in the movie for roughly 10-15 minutes total, he does a very well job at depicting a phony, belligerent, television personality. Brett Cullen also gives a fine performance as the billionaire mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne, and has a part in Jokers madness.The word 'masterpiece' should never be thrown around lightly. It's a term we use to describe an outstanding, almost perfect, piece of art. There are only so many films that can be considered 'masterpieces'. Rarely do we ever see a flawless movie, especially this day in age. With that being said, it is hard to NOT consider 'Joker' a masterpiece. Every scene is just as important as the next, every actor delivers a wonderful performance, and Todd Phillips does an outstanding job directing the villains transformation. 'Joker' absolutely deserves a 10/10, and nothing short of that. This movie holds a mirror up to society; it should make you question what part society takes in one's slow drift into madness. This is very relevant to today, and is a perfect example of why something like this needs to be addressed and taken seriously. Everyone needs to see this movie. Again, it will be talked about for many years to come, and could very well be considered one of the greatest drama/thrillers of all time."
2481,"I am floored, humbled, awestruck and amazed.
This movie is in one word....brilliant.
Just see it, your life will be changed.
A cinematic masterpiece."
2482,"To claim that this film is anything other than a masterpiece is a claim that is tainted by a contradictory outlook on how mental illness should be portrayed/addressed by the media.You will ALWAYS have people who dislike films like this; to make a film this potent and powerful is to make a film that is going to be extremely controversial, and I'm sure that is exactly what the writers and directors foresaw in the making of this film.That being said, you can FEEL their vision with every single frame of this absolute masterpiece, and Phoenix not only gives the best performance of his life, but also takes the character of the Joker to a place we have never seen him before, and he takes society with him.The question of Phoenix vs Ledger will be no doubt raging within the coming months and years after this film's release. The fact is that the question is void because of the fact that they portray COMPLETELY different aspects of the Joker's persona, and both portray is masterfully. However, Phoenix's portrayal goes much deeper than Ledger's at least on an emotional level, which is all I shall say in that regard.The visceral assault of emotions I experienced during this film was unlike anything I've ever felt or experienced in my life. To portray such a traditionally psychotic character in such an emotional, and even sympathetic way, depending on your outlook, is an unbelievable feat.Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and of course that is okay; people and critics are going to dislike this film, that is their opinion. But to deny that this film is anything other than a masterpiece would sadly be false, and I absolutely applaud everyone involved in this absolute work of art."
2483,"I see alot of news from US saying its too violent. Even taking precautions like having cops around the theaters. What happened to USA? This was just showed in Asia, and everyone was chill. Still BEST movie of the year, Americans need to chill and eat snowflakes"
2484,"This movie make me feel admiringly, joker the Best movie ever"
2485,"Lesson: don't kick a person when they are down. Joker is not a 'comic book movie' and should not be ranked or compared to any DCEU or MCU films just as you would not compare ""Logan"", ""... 3,000 "". The richest and the people in charge of 'systems' in this world will never see it, but you should."
2486,"I went to this movie 3 times, and I cried harder each time. It almost seems like Joaquin is under a spell, it was not acting, it was more than that. Joaquin showed so much emotion so much brilliance , he is absolutely crazy. Genius crazy, he deserves everything for this amazing performance that everyone will be talking about 10+ years later. The cinematography, the music, everything was unreal. Bless anyone that worked on this masterpiece"
2487,"We just had to wait for Joaquin Phoenix to prove how arrogant we were. His performance is a delightful gift, which adds a new angle to the story of one of the best comic book villains ever created.
There will still be people disappointed just because they were waiting for another superheroes' movie, full of action and CGI. It's not about that. You don't need it here. Not with a good script, accurately directed, with a brilliant performance. Altogether makes us think about this villain in different ways, enjoying this retro style journey to the heart and brain of Joker. And I definitely think now we know much more about him."
2488,"This movie blew my mind! It was funny, shocking, brutal, and sad. I hope Joaquin Phoenix gets a oscar for his brilliant acting performance. He deserves it! Hopefully they make a Part 2🤞🏼"
2489,"For long we wanted to see a origin story of Joker and here it is. Struggling comedian to Joker. Heath Ledger's joker deals on his vague origin story - ""Do you know how I got these scars"". Here is a origin story on - ""Do you know how I became Joker""
No high level vfx/cgi action scenes, almost no comedy - but this movie would keep you engaged for 2 hours. It will take a day to process the movie.This movie deserves few oscars, if suicide squad can get why not Joker"
2490,"First time writing here. Just watched the film in Korea.
Joaquin Phoenix delivers the best acting in years of cinema. And the storyline is super. Not a corny superhero film but rather a depiction of a psychological, social birth of a supervillain. Thumbs up. Will definitely recommend for yeara to come."
2491,"First this movie was not true to the comics which if it were written that way the storyline would have been more interesting to watch. Next, Joaquin had very big shoes to fill, I applaud him for his attempt at the Joker but his performance fell short. The movie is hard to watch if you are expecting any resemblance of the Dark Knight trilogy. This movie is more a real gritty look at a man struggling with mental illeness with no charm of any of the past Jokers."
2492,Don't waste your money. Shouldn't have even been made. Best actor..golden globe REALLY !!
2493,"Nothing more to say, but i must still write something because my review is too short ...."
2494,"I would give it a 7 or 8 at most, but too many 10's and ""Masterpiece"", ""Best joker"" reviews made me feel like I need to point out what is wrong with it and why this hyped reviews are wrong.First off the movie is not at all bad, I have been pretty sick of cliche superhero movies lately and this is a very nice change, just not an awesome one. I went in with full expectation I would like the movie seeing all those reviews, maybe they raised my expectations too high. I felt I saw a very classic story of a bullied man turned mad, nothing special about the overall plot, its not complicated, is not philosophical, no memorable, impactful dialogues, monologues, or even phrases it doesn't give you much more to think about than ""Bullying is bad""Now to the real gems of the movie Acting, Cinematography and Score. The acting was great, but not as great as people say, I have seen enough movies to know excellent acting when I see it, in simple terms, you must not see the actor, but the character at all times even if you are trying to see the actor, like Christian Bale in ""The Fighter"". That masterclass is what I was hoping here knowing Joaquin Phoenix capacity as an actor, as demonstrated in ""The Master"", and though there were times this was true, there were times it just felt like he was trying too hard to be a maniac, it did not feel as natural as I hoped it to be, and it may be Phillips' fault here since he is not very experienced directing masterclass actors or maybe even recognizing masterclass acting.For the Cinematography, There were some genuinely beautiful shots in this movie, many of the shots felt like a comic book frame, the only thing I would complain about is that I did not feel like any of them really stood out, I did not feel any of them gave us any kind of subtext that gave us more information, more to think about or even simply hypnotizing enough to be called masterclass, I may need to watch it again with more attention to be sure, but overall it was great and definitely one of the better elements of the filmNow for the score, for me probably the best element of the film, it does really capture the haunting feeling of being alone, sad and insane at the same time and without it, the best scenes of the film would not have been as great as they are. but as much as I loved it, I still would think hard considering it ""Masterclass"" though I would give this element a 9/10 without thinking too hardI really wish this movie is as great as people say, I really believed the hype, but I sometimes forget that I may have seen more films than the average person to see the flaws not many people seem to find, in a way is sad because I know I will never be easily satisfied with a movie the way I did when I was a kid.Im giving the film a 3, but only trying to balance out the undeserved many 10 reviews it has, the film should not have more than an 8 at most"
2495,"Lets start with the obvious, any scores of 1 or 10 are to be ignored as they tend to be comic book nerd scores (1 means Marvel fan, 10 means DC fan).This movie really has me mixed on what to think about it. I understand they wanted to make a movie about what makes someone turns into a villian, so they decided later having it be about Joker would make people actually want to see it. Which is why I give it such a low score. If you needed Joker in it in order to get people to see it, then maybe it wasn't a good movie then.I love Joker (the character). I've loved every iteration of him. And I can see why they chose him because he does fit the part for what they wanted. And while they do state this Joker is its own alternate universe sort of Joker, it still feels off. It feels more like a movie about a unstable man, but with some Batman lore stuff hinted throughout just to make it more appealing.Am I saying the movie is terrible? Not by any means. It was actually pretty good. If anything Phoenix did an amazing job making you care about Arthur yet also feeling creeped out by him. I should also note this movie is in NO way for kids.If Joker was removed from it and it was just a movie about a man gone bad, I'd give it a 8 or 9 probably. But again, using Joker as the selling point since they said no one wanted to see it otherwise, really made me deduct points."
2496,"Have you ever fired a gun empty? And then, kept firing? Then you'll like this movie! It'll remind you of the good ol' days."
2497,"It was okay, the beginning was really good, nutnthe end lefte with a bad taste in my mouth, I just really thought the jokers' motivation was lacking. And I thought the whole character was pretty inlikeable"
2498,"This movie was NOT very good as far as a DC villain back story goes. If Heath Ledger was round, I bet dollars to donuts that this film is never made.This movie looks like an attempt, to once again, re-imagine a character that doesnt need reimagining. There are 3 jokers in the works, Caesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, and Heath Ledger. Ledger perfected the roll....lets just let it go guys.The movie itself was disturbing as far as mental illness goes, but it was much more disturbing as far as DC Villain backstories goes. I dont not accept this backstory, it was poorly conceived but well done.By the way....the joker wears purple guys, you arent changing that, sorry."
2499,"This film is strictly a character development of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) and how he transformed into The Joker. They could have done this in a number of different ways. In this film, he is a deranged vigilante in the battle of haves vs have nots. We do see Bruce Wayne as a child with Arthur many years his senior. It takes about 90 minutes until the big action happens. I was a bit disappointed when they made Joker brain-damaged rather than a criminal mastermind. The production takes place during the time span of about a month or so. His childhood is discussed, but not shown.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. No Batman. No Harley Quinn."
2500,"A very serious look at how the famous comic book character came into being. Starting with personal failures and challenges, the character (Phoenix), through an act of violence inadvertently causes social change that slowly but surely brings things to their inevitable explosive and violent conclusion.Often slow and very intense, but never boring, the whole, beautifully filmed exercise completely revolves around Phoenix and his extraordinary performance. A unique film to be sure and one to watch - but not a little troubling."
2501,"If Ledger showed us the deranged, criminal mastermind that is the joker than Joaquin told us how he got there. The journey is darker and more disturbing and the result is a movie that is so good, so epic, so raw that you walk out thinking, I can't watch that again.
In that way it really is like Taxi Driver, and realistically with what the film is trying to portray I can't help but feel that's a respectful response.
A lot of really satisfying nods to numerous Joker portrayals, in writing, screenplay, soundtrack and in the nuances of Joaquins portrayal. But the Dark Knight nods are the ones that really get the excitement up whilst avoiding any cheesy CGI and glad to see no sequal or spinoff platform was built in to the story.Truly a masterpiece.... that maybe you should only see once...."
2502,I struggled.....15 minutes in and I'm waiting for something to happen.It's boring.Decent acting but no plot. I wasn't entertained at all.This was badly overhyped and I actually debated just not finishing it at all.
2503,"I convinced myself to watch due to the good ratings here, despite not being convinced by the trailer.Big mistake, it's really as disappointing as expected, it's just annoying to watch,"
2504,"Joaquin Phoenix performance is absolutely amazing.
I could have done million better things with the time that i wasted watching this movie.
Utter waste of time. decided to watch after all the hype on social media.
But movie deserves 0 stars."
2505,Most overrated garbage film I've ever seen. Dumbest protagonist and he's supposed to be Batman's ultimate villain? Come on.
2506,Never watch this movie. It gave me so much anxiety that caused me to have an anxiety that caused me to laugh and cry uncontrollably for 2 hours. It was the worst thing I've seen in my entire life. It got oscars but it shouldn't have. I still have problems from it. It was so disturbing that I had problems emotionally for a week. I have generalized anxiety disorder so there should have been a warning. But there was no warning. Moving from the worst part. On to the bad part. It was not the jokers origin story at all. It was just some screwed up stuff Hollywood spun together to make money. Please take this warning.
2507,This movie was pretty boring. Very tough to stay awake.
2508,"This movie was literally about Nothing, it made someone who was usually 2 or 3 steps ahead of Batman (Supposedly the best detective ever) as a complete moron who just gets lucky. It was so bad the only thing that I liked about it was the popcorn I ate while trying to stay awake. Joaquin Phoenix was amazing, cant blame him for no story or a garbage Director. DC should stick with TV and Animation."
2509,"This movie was the most boring movie I've ever seen. The last 10-15 minutes was the good.
It only took reputation."
2510,"First off, this movie almost seemed like it was written originally for a different type of attraction, then had the joker back store planted in to get more attention.
Heath ledger still will always be a better joker hands down.If Bruce Wayne was a little boy during this period and adding Bruce's father could of possibly been the jokers dad for a moment until it was discovered that the joker was abandoned and adopted then take those points out and it's not really about anything other then a guy that went crazy and killed his mom for lying to him( or not really telling him the truth)It's truly said how some people are actually saying how good this movie is because to be 100% honest here it really wasn't that good.I do not disagree that the dark knight wasn't that great of a movie but Heath ledger made the joker roll and the movie that much more. His total role was so good it's hard to try to even get close to what he did. So please just stop trying to compare because they aren't even close.Good luck in the future trying to continue this side of the joker as most of you may know they made over 1 billion $$$& from you people that think this was good. Lol not so much."
2511,"The joker is an enigma that started 60+ years ago. When you try to adjust or add to it you are most likely going to fail. The joker was always a cartoon mafioso, the purple outfit, green hair and face paint as the cartoon aspects, where as the suit or tuxedo, guns, explosives and the lackeys are the mafioso aspects. To reduce the character to a person with psychiatric and possible intellectual disabilities diminishes the complexity and fun of the character that is the joker.Bottom line: If you're looking for a movie about a charter that has a break with reality and the following consequences it's good, if you're looking for a movie that follows the 60+ year history of the joker character in DC comics it fails."
2512,"I can see how a privileged normie will see this and think ""oh no, this will inspire the lower, unprivileged class to be violent towards us"" but if you have a few brain cells to scrape together, as well as some empathy you can totally understand what this was about - and it ain't that.A sweet, though mentally struggling, mentally abused man trying to be a light in the darkness of society is only getting punished for it until he's unwillingly pushed into things he would never possibly want to do, such as cause harm.An invisible man becomes visible. There's plenty of us who are invisible, and plenty of you who have your brainless followers and think you're the center of the universe. Even if you're not that famous you're still arrogant enough to consider yourself special because you're in Hollywood. How could you possibly understand this movie?This movie was perfectly timed in an age where mainstream media and Hollywood celebrities who smell their own far7s all day and virtue signal on Twitter while knowing nothing about life outside of a mansion - daily demonize what they view as lower class, and inexplicably, men in general. Especially emotionally fragile men like Joker.
So I see why some of the same mainstream media grasped for straws in order to twist this masterpiece into one of their little ""controversies"" in order to deter the same people they hate from watching a movie, finally, one movie, they could possibly relate to - because the struggle to survive and be kind while being deemed a low class freak is portrayed scary realistic."
2513,"First of all: yes, it's a good movie. Well acted and very convincing.But: This is not a story about the Joker.It is a good story about someone who is sick. About a Society that doesn't care. About someone who breaks - and coincidently is dressed as a clown.The Joker - as far as i can recall - is a very brilliant (super) villain. He doesn't have superpowers so he has to be clever. He has to be always one step ahead in order to take on Batman.This guy is not clever, he is just a poor guy dressed as a clown."
2514,"In this modern age of streaming and with a multitude of content available, taking the time and money to go to the cinema can seem like an unnecessary outing when so much else is readily available. If you're anything like me then your cinema trips nowadays, are limited to the big blockbusters (or kids films, for those that have) to make use of the big screen and sound, that you can't get in your own home.With that in mind my take on this retelling origin story of Batman's biggest nemesis is as follows:Firstly, it might be obvious from all the hype surrounding the film that this is not a comic book movie, those expecting that will be very disappointed. Instead Joker takes a look into the real life reasons why a normal man with mental health issues might become the bigger than life villain. Joaquin Phoenix Plays Arthur Fleck, a deeply troubled man trying make ends meet to support himself and his frail mother. Arthur has a condition that makes him laugh uncontrollably during times of distress and thus is and outcast of society. With this condition coupled with depression and a traumatic childhood, Arthur finds work in the only place he can as a clown for hire. The city of Gotham is in complete disarray, with it's people getting more and more violent towards its government and it's here where the two story lines intersect, giving a deep dark and sometimes very real account of wether it is nature or nurture that creates such people.It's certainly true that Joaquin Phoenix goes all in with the crazy, his performance is very 'I am Sam', if you get the Tropic Thunder reference. His body alone shows the dedication he's put into his performance, looking very malnourished and sickly. The plot itself stays grounded and doesn't take unimaginable leaps with it's audience.My issue is that this story and Phoenix's portrayal seem a bit reminiscent of other movies, there's a certain early Nicholas Cage quality about the more mad side of the character. It felt like the story was almost damaged by the expectation of 'The Joker' as a character or even it's comic book links. I left feeling that had it just been the same story and portrayal, but without it's links to Batman or the Joker it may have faired better.Answering my initial statement, it feels a lot of hard work and effort went into this movie and Phoenix is definitely engrossing to watch at times. However, I think I would've preferred watching this in the comfort of my own home and that it didn't deserve a cinema viewing."
2515,Do your self a favour and watch this movie before it gotten spoiled
2516,Joker is a very fun guy even if he is sick it made my day.
2517,What a mesmerizing performance by Joaquin Phoenix!!My eyes were glued to the screen for the entire duration of this masterpiece.Phoenix earned his Oscar with the most compelling performance I have seen in a film.
2518,"What do you get when you put Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips together?JOKERThe reason why this film is so amazing is because of one simple thing-you cannot escape the fact that as your watching the film you feel so uncomfortable and so bad for Arthur.As you watch him get beaten up in allways and subways you want him to have power and win the fights.But that's what makes it so good.You dont know if the people are going to make it put alive.Another great thing about this movie is the fact that you get to watch the transformation from Arthur Fleck to Joker happen right in front of your eyes.As the movie goes along Arthurs life is getting torn apart bit by bit.Starting from his job.His family secret.His mother and finally to his identity.The reason why this movie works well is because its really realistic.Like something like this could definently pop-off in todays world.Because unfortunently they're are people out there who are getting bullied,who are getting misstreated and outkasted by society and those people are might go down a dark path like the joker on losing there identity.THE ACTING:Joaquin Phoenix 100000% deserved that Best Actor oscar.His portrayal as Arthur in this movie is incredible.Not only Joaquin.But De Niro as well.Every Actor and Actress in this movie pit there A-Game on the table.LIGHTING,CAMERA AND DIRECTING:The lighting was PERFECT.And im a little upset that nobody is saying how well the camera quality looked in this movie.Todd Phillips is a sensatinal Director.He should've win Best Director for this film.The Hangiver is an amazing series of his.I cant wait to see mire if this guys movies.My Dissapointments:I would give this movie a 10/10 on the spot but the thing that kind of let me down was the fact that Todd Phillips didnt release the Deleted Scenes.And also the fact that this movie is 121 minutes long.You cant make a Joker origin story thats only 2 hours long,it honestly could be longer then 2 hours.Im dissapointed because i was like""WHY ARE YOU NOT RELEASING THE DELEATED SCENES,ADD MORE SCENES THAT I CAN ENJOY"".But length and budget dosent really matter.IN CONCLUSION:Long Story Put Short
People Are going to be remembering this film for a long time.PS:this movie is way better then the dark knight.Sorry but somebody had to say it.-NoFace"
2519,Joaquin Phoenix is an outstanding actor very well deserved the oscar. He's been acting in good movies for a while now. I hope he continues making great movies and entertaining and powerful messages.
2520,"Nobody cares how joker feels, like nobody cares about me. Joaquin Phoenix worth it."
2521,The Greatest comic book movie to come out since The Dark Knight.
2522,There is always some madness in love. But there is also always some reason in madness.Friedrich Nietzsche
2523,"As we know about the Joker's character, he's crazy and smart, but in this movie we saw a different Joker. We watched Arthur's life before he became the Joker. This movie excels in several things, Including directed and produced by 'Todd Phillips' 9/10, cinematography it was so amazing 9/10, the great acting by 'Joequin Phoenix' 9/10, the classic music was so wonderful with atmosphere of the movie 8/10, From the beginning until the ending the escalation of events was perfect 9/10. I'm glad to everyone who worked for this masterpiece 8.5."
2524,Amazing movie with an incredible message! And well deserved Academy Award for Joaquim! Loved his performance!
2525,"Its a horrible film, filled with horrible characters. It isn't entertaining, it's unsettling. Basically, it is unpleasant to watch. That people claim that this film speaks to them is deeply concerning. It is negative nihilistic garbage and is the last thing the world needs.I give a star for acting and a star for production value."
2526,"I did know it was a different kind of origin story, but jeesh it was so dull!
Seeing all the positive reviews here I think I must be the only one!
Phoenix was acting his ass off for sure, but it was just not my cup of tea I guess."
2527,"This movie shows how amazing and powerful cinema can be, for the enrire duration of the movie, you feel the pain, the sorrow and the experience of what joker has been experienced throughout his life. It shows you how a society can systematically make someone crazy, make someone feeling like they have has enough and they want to pay back the sick society.
This movie is simply brilliant."
2528,"I've watched this movie four times
Mr. Phoenix simply is a legend"
2529,"45 minutes the first night, red wine. 45 minutes the second night, no wine. Why did I waste my time. Sorry but this is crap."
2530,"The worst part about having a mentalillness is, people expect you to behave as if you don't.
The leading role is one of the best I've ever seen. There is no performance trace, is completely the clown himself, demeanor, action language are very accurate description."
2531,"This is not an easy watch. It's dark and disturbing to witness the Jokers life just prior to turning into the criminal mastermind he becomes.
Joaquin Phoenix is very good as the Joker, his mannerisms and persona are consistent, meticulous and he carries the movie well. That leaves little else though for the cast around him. He's in pretty much every scene which makes the film intense and quite uneasy to watch as you see a man on severe medication get angrier and angrier.
It's a good film but it wont leave you in a happy or rewarding mood after.
There is a bit of Bruce Wayne in there which will leave you asking was there a 30+ year age gap between them?....
Anyway, if you'd like to see how the Joker becomes bad here it is."
2532,"This is all I will say, If they were smart they would start the Batman movie series with this Movie. That is all."
2533,"This movie really paints a deeper picture of the character of the Joker. It takes a more human view of the 2D Joker character that we all know of. The well-known dispute between Batman and Joker is more understood through this movie - even though Todd Phillips and the writers made it a little more detached from the traditional Joker character in order to give it a more human, realistic touch. The made up scenarios in the Arthur's head and the background of his life as to why he acts the way he does is all made clear through the ""Joker"" movie.It's interesting too because on top of the great cinematography, writing, and acting from Joaquin Phoenix in the movie, Arthur Fleck (before he became Joker) definitely did his job. His mom said her son's purpose was to make people laugh and smile. He did that. Just in a different way. Just in an evil way.One thing to note - and I know I'll be reiterating what I said above - but it needs to be understood. This movie truly is different from any movie that is interconnected with the Avengers, Batman, or previous Joker movies. The ""Joker"" movie I just watched, is a deep dive into the background of the Joker himself and it shows the spiral Arthur Fleck takes to join his alter ego: The Joker.This movie was talked about in high regards before I saw it. I now see why. Great work cast and crew."
2534,"The music. The intense. The realism. The performance. The story. Such a perfect combination of everything. I never felt that a character like joker could be real until I saw this. Phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and shows us how power can be obtained. Philips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music, camera angles, lighting and every important factor. Overall, I did not expect the story to be this perfect. Too many shocking turns happened and it really does represent today's society. If I was in the first screening, I would have applauded for 80 min not 8."
2535,"They say the Phoenix rises from its own ashes--Joaquin does just that --what a flight he takes!! He evokes pathos in the most terrifying way! It is a spellbinding performance that will remain etched in gold in movie history. The joker laugh, his walk, his dance, his antics, & then his eyes--all make you wonder why an incredible actor like him keeps such low profile. He lets his work speaks & how!! ""
Don't compare this with Heath ledger-he played the Joker"";Joaquin is Arthur Fleck and his subsequent metamorphosis into the Joker! Both supremely captivating acts!
For those self appointed critics who call it depressing & condemn the violence--there is more happening in real world countries. There is nothing in this movie that has not been already shown on the big screen before-calling it disturbing and encouraging crime is such a biased take or are you so weak that a movie like this makes you take up crime??"
2536,"The acting was totally impeccable. But the movie, It did not keep me interested the whole time. On my opinion it was just a movie played by some terrific actors."
2537,Make a man and take everything from him... Joker 💕
2538,"This was definitely a roller coaster ride of suspense and surprise. Juaquin nailed the role, causing me to dare to care about such a twisted soul."
2539,"Great acting, great plot and suspense. Perfect building up of the story. You can basically feel what Arthur is going thru. And such a welcome change to all these superhero movies...hopefully this starts something off that would give us Batman & co movies different that current DC & marvel stuff that I actually do like. But would love to see similar, more darker, for adults only movies coming out on Batman etc."
2540,"The acting is perfect, the picture, story and every aspects is very perfect. Best movie of all time, not gonna talk much."
2541,"The craziness of society brings about the collective craziness of anti society. It only takes a bad day for everyone to become a clown. To be honest, the proposition of ""doing evil because of oppression"" is not new, but jackun Phoenix's step-by-step Methodist performance sublimates the whole movie! His body and expression perfectly tell the world what is the absolute darkness of the airtight~"
2542,Powerful and relevant but not always easy to watch.
2543,"Joaquin Phoenix's performance is very emotional, expressing pain with an uncontrollable giggling, making people sad. The film is very different from most previous superhero movies, with no special effects, no spectacles, or even too many action scenes. But in a slightly retro way, tell why the clown became that clown. In fact, it is a very serious film, including paying attention to social issues. The movie is kind of evil and will make you feel a little sympathy for this clown. In addition, this film should not be sequel and derivative, because it is still too real, if the character is re-comicized, it will no longer be him."
2544,"Consensus: Joker is a film that truly makes you think about this famous villain with outstanding acting, character development and score, making it one of the best pieces of cinema in the last 10 years."
2545,Memberships of those who score below 9 must be canceled and their rights to watch movies must be removed.
2546,I won't judge it by it's quality but how it impacted me emotionally. I can really relate to the things shown in the film and that's why I really feel the film everytime I watch it. People who can relate to it's consepts should love this film I think.
2547,"This movie literally blew my mind. It took me a while to want to see it because I wasn't very convinced about empathising with a character like the Joker but wow, just wow. What an amazing movie!"
2548,"Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant.Pure class.What a movie,enjoyed every second of this.Really sad story about Arthur Fleck and his mental illness,went twice to cinema to see it.Oscar deserved,thank you Joaquin Phoenix."
2549,"I don't understand why the rating here is 8.5/10, this movie is total masterpiece. Todd Philips and Joaquin Phoenix has created history with this one.
This storyline gave us a very different version of the character, Joker. One thing is for sure, this character will define a different perspective of a Super Villain, but for me, Joker is not a villain, HE IS AN ANTI-HERO."
2550,"About how a man disgraced and bullied by society goes downhill to become the joker. It shows how society sometimes messes you up.This is how the joker was meant to be, not a gangster like suicide squad."
2551,One of the best movies I have seen in a very long time the cinematography and directing is great and Joaquin Phoenix is an amazing actor would recommend to anyone
2552,"I wasn't expecting the treat that I got from this film. In my humble opinion, it should have received the 'Best film Oscar' I've seen 'Judy' and '1917' 'Hollywood' but 'Joker' wins by a mile."
2553,"Not since DeNiro in Taxi Driver have we seen a movie where in every single scene of the movie you'll be saying to yourself ""Uh, oh! He's gonna snap and do something crazy!"" Phoenix will have you on the edge of a blade from beginning to end. This is the kind of comic book movies I like. Deep character dive and skip the super powers and super hero fights. Great movie! Watch it and watch it again!"
2554,"Recently I dont find movies especially American movies successful but this one is excluded. IN mant ways though it looked like Taxi Driver,in consequence film was amazing. It is also a sad story of a loser who just wanted to be happy and love the world. Applause..."
2555,"Nobody can tells what will happen exactly like God does, we human are too small in many ways.I like this movie because it gives hopes a hope that you can breath whenever bad things happen in your life, if we don't choose suicide, we have to live and face the daily problems.Why not use a way that can inspire yourself and maybe other !Extremely good acting !"
2556,"Director: Todd Phillips
Writers: Todd Phillips, Scott Silver
Stars: Joaquin Phoenix, Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Frances ConroyThis film for me is fantastic. Everything from the acting, to the directing, to the cinematography, sound and editing.In Gotham City, mentally troubled comedian Arthur Fleck is disregarded and mistreated by society. He then embarks on a downward spiral of revolution and bloody crime. This path brings him face-to-face with his alter-ego: the Joker. This film has a great sense of suspense, tension and dread. It really depicts how mental illness and society can tear people apart.The use of dark colors (Black, Brown, etc) really gives off the impression how gruesome and dirty Gotham can be. The use of music in this film really heightens the tension, the score really sells the transformation of the Joker. It is bone-chilling and gut-wrenching.Our leader through this world is the relentless Joaquin Phoenix, who gives what is very possibly the finest performance of his career. He summons the feeling that he was born to play this role.
The writers (Todd Phillips and Scott Silver) placed all their cards in the Joker character with the film relying on him in every scene, and phoenix delivers to an incredibly high standard. Joaquin Phoenix is truly Oscar Worthy in this film.I personally believe that this film will be a classic in years to come. Even though the events that are depicted have shown controversy, I think it will gain a cult following.92nd Academy Awards Films I have seen to date:

2557,"THE MOVIE WAS GREAT! Joaquin won his Oscar, fair and square!"
2558,"I found the Joker trailer pretty compelling but then when I came across the dozens and dozens of 1 star reviews here opposing all the dozens and dozens of 10 star reviews I sat there wondering how the hell could a film divide so many people so massively? There were so many that I couldn't ignore it, I started watching the movie thinking there was a possibility I would be bitterly disappointed.In the end I was delighted to discover it is indeed a masterpiece, a fantastic piece of cinematic history, one of the most enjoyable movies I have watched in a long time. The acting is just superb, the story excellent, the musical score was quite haunting and the directing was exquisite - quite simply 10 out of 10.How could so many people not enjoy it? The only explanation I can come up with it that perhaps they went to the cinema expecting a Batman movie, or hoping that it would be a CGI-packed action movie like the typical DC comic movie. If that's what you were expecting then I can understand the disappointment but to give it just 1 star because you felt stupid or foolish is really unfair.This is an incredibly compelling origin story with some sensational acting that deserves every Oscar it wins (which I am sure it will) but to those of you expecting a standard Batman or Ironman flick or if you're hoping for Wonder Woman to jump out from behind a car then you will be disappointed. It is a fantastic movie."
2559,"I've watched this movie three times and every time I felt more close to Arthur(Joker)!As I've found that some didn't like this movie, even the high level criticizers, in my opinion the reason is mostly because they couldn't attach themselves with this character as a poor mentally ill person which in ""Joker"" words; "" the society abandons him and treats him like trash"" or maybe the slow process of storyline has bothered them or even they are from a capitalist class, or...etc. but whatever is their reason, the truth is that those people who are from a poor and mid class, felt more closely to this character which is fortunately and by master chosen, played by ""Joaquin Phoenix"".This intention for making a riot against capitalist class who consider themselves the saviors with a kind of society that believes that too, and cruelty and inhumanity comes out of it, is touchable in all cultures and countries nowadays.These are all about the story part which had made the whole story to change in our minds that maybe the HERO is Joker, not Batman who is a son of that capitalist class(I don't mean what Joker's ideology leads to be, is right and perfect, of course not; but the feeling Inside is really close to him).These politicians and capitalists are all making millions of ""Jokers"" all over the world and It'd be interesting to say at least in my country, those who didn't like this movie are mostly the wealthy people and their supporters!! (not all of them, for sure).Beside all I said about the story and the philosophy behind it( which is my own concept), I think everything else is good about this movie. Who can deny Joaquin Phoenix perfect acting??! Or what would be wrong about the direction and other parts, maybe some miner things but those can really be overlooked or as an audience, not really important.It wasn't just an introduction for the past of Batman and his hateful enemies, but an introduction for ""Joker"" side and view of the whole story that changes the belief of being against this character to be like something in his side...!As a criticism to be fair, it lacked one thing for me and that was the time which was spent for ""Joker"", I think the movie needed one more hour after the hospital scene... :)Anyway, at last I hope a lot for Mr. Phoenix, Mr. Philips and all the movie people for the Oscar ceremony 2020."
2560,"The movie is so greatIt's another view of Joker. But so true and well done.Joaquin deserves the Oscar. Will see if tomorrow they'll assign it to him.The film is s crescendo of pathos and actions. Picture, music, photography, scenes, plot, all is great.Frankly I suggest you to watch it."
2561,"Having watched this last night, I am in a trance. This film was absolutely brilliant, but it is not for the faint hearted. Joaquin Phoenix does the best Joker we've seen since The Dark Knight and he must receive Best Actor for this. This film is not so gory it should be an 18, but it is particularly gory. In one scene, a man is stabbed with scissors and his head is bashed against a wall. The aftermath is disgusting. Strong language occurs throughout the film. Beware, this is NOT a superhero movie. This film is about mental health and it is not in any way about the DC universe. Even my dad liked it, and that's saying something."
2562,"I loved every minuet of Joker. I was extremely happy when I found out that we would be solely looking into the Jokers character and identifying what makes him tick and what causes his characteristics. Now before i go into what I loved about the cinematography, i need to say Joaquin Phoenix played the character exceptionally. His laughter to his delivery to his weight loss, Joaquin really made the character convincing and mesmerized me. It's amazing how we feel sympathy for someone who killed people and see the antagonistic as the protagonist in a way. Furthermore, Joaquin got the Joker's laugh on point. Not only is the laugh pretty psychotic, but we wince at the pain he goes through when he start to cough uncontrollably.Moving onto the cinematography Lawrence Sher did a amazing job with his colour correction, his composition to his use of semiotic theory. The use of the grungy dark green and dimmed black really conveys the tone of the film. Especially in the bathroom scenes and the subway shots. However, the composition was the aspect that really blew me away. Lawrence really used his surroundings to not only get rid of negative space and make the film look beautiful, but he is fantastic a making the viewers eyes look at a certain part of the screen.I could go on and on about this film, however, being a young film student I don't feel like I am in a position where i can criticize this films cinematography or direction. However, if i would have to give one improvement it would be certain tweaks to parts of the script. Mainly when it comes to his family relationship. I would of loved to have seen more of that.A amazing film and a must watch!"
2563,"For what this movie was supposed to be, it was absolutely incredible. The direction, the cinematography and the acting (!!!) were all Oscar worthy and deserve all of the hype and attention they have received. However, none of these aspects of the film distracted me from how disturbing, violent, and dark the story was. Selfishly, I almost wish they would've lightened it up a bit but I understand why they didn't. This was a real look into mental illness and compromising on story line would not have given us the character development they were going for.
There were a few things about the film that I thought were unrealistic (even in a fictional city like Gotham) but I realize that there is no precedence for a character like Joker IRL. You really can't let these things bother you, and you have to go in with an open mind and take the movie for what it is. I thoroughly enjoyed the production, but for me, the film is too dark to squirm through again."
2564,"I was hesitant to watch this film as the reviews I read weren't good. It was described as ""artsy"" and ""slow"". My guess now is that those reviews were written by toddlers. This film is nothing like the typical Batman movies however it still has great action scenes. In my opinion, this film is far better than the typical superhero/villain movies. How it subtly focuses on mental health issues is just wonderful. People like myself can relate in a deeper way than the average movie goer. As for the acting...wow, blown away. Joaquin has shown many times hes a great actor but his talent in this film is unmatched. It pushed him to the very top of my favorites list. If you love a good story, great characters, intense action and a film that makes you think, you will not be disappointed!"
2565,"I knew that I loved Joker when I first saw it, but I have now seen it three times and it just keeps getting better with every rewatch. Obviously, the shining achievement of this film is Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck. There isn't really much I can say about his performance that hasn't already been said, but I would be completely shocked and a little upset if he doesn't win the Oscar for Best Actor.Phoenix perfectly embodied the role of a man who was beaten down and broken by the society that he was being forced to live in, and we as an audience were able to completely understand where he was coming from. That doesn't mean that we approve of his actions, but all of the best villains are the people with a backstory that we can understand, and this absolutely happened in Joker.The supporting actors all played their parts as well, and there wasn't a single weak link to the film. I am shocked that Todd Phillips went from directing films like The Hangover and Due Date, to Joker. I never knew he has this level of talent within him, but now I am genuinely excited to see where he will go from here. Having rewatched Joker a few times now, Philips scatters breadcrumbs throughout the film that I was able to pick up when revisiting it, and he also pays attention to loads of insignificant details which I loved.The score was also phenomenal, and added to the tone of the picture. I also really liked the cinematography, because every frame had care put into it and was able showcase exactly what Phillips was going for. I loved everything about Joker, and consider it to definitely be one of the best comic book movies ever made, even if it doesn't go about it in the traditional sense.Plain and simple, Joker is a masterpiece, and it just gets better the more I watch it.SCORE: 100%"
2566,"Easy to relate and gives a neat backstory to our good-all Joker.
The story is on-point, very clear and overall good. Great cinematography, the way the music plays just on the right time feels splendid. They knew exactly what they were doing. Phoenix guy nailed it with his acting! Anyone who likes a good film would enjoy this one."
2567,Love this movie ... but I hate it. It's about mental illness. It's not a joker movie. It breaks my heart but it's so good! I won't ever watch it again tho it's so sad
2568,"I won't argue or dispute that some people really enjoyed this movie. I was not one of them. I really didn't find the plot particularly compelling. I have friends who told me that the movie is "" deep"" and for those who ""don't need their subject matter spoonfed. "" I found the film to be a bit shallow and not entertaining. Of course this is just my opinion. Joaquin Phoenix's performance was very good, and the reason for the 4th and 5th star."
2569,"Great acting, the cry laugh was fantastic. It gets really deep in you and you can understand why Arthur became the Joker.
Enjoyable"
2570,"U can see the pain in jokers eyes, his performance was so great."
2571,"The story doesn't work for this character and this character doesn't work for this movie.It's quite insulting the prestige this movie is gaining even though it's so poorly planned out. It wants to milk the ""Joker"" name and fan base to please teenagers and fanboys while trying to do a new Taxi Driver and/or The King of Comedy (straight up copying-pasting so many elements!). And trying to go both ways doesn't work.The excessive amount of overexplaining and overacting is annoying and exhausting. We get it! The guy's crazy! People are mean to him! Joaquin Phoenix lost a lot of weight! None of it serves the story!Overall is an ok movie but a waste of a decent story on a comic book character that doesn't fit in it."
2572,"Last night I finally got to watch this film. 'The Joker' is thrilling from beginning to end. This take on the very iconic character was just so intriguing. Arthur is such a fully realized character. His story is both a tragedy and a comedy. The movie follows this character from the misunderstood tragic clown to his descent into madness. And Joaquin Phoenix captures all of this really well with his Oscar-worthy performance. He's one hell of an actor. This movie works so well because of him.Yes, there are a lot of similarities and homages to several films like ' Taxi Driver' but I think Todd Phillips and everyone did such an amazing job making this movie so it stands on its own. The score by composer Hildur Guonadottir was terrific as well.I think a lot of people can relate to a character like Arthur. He's the forgotten man. The weirdo. Cast aside by society. No one gave a crap about him and it's a real shame. The system failed him and many others. Mental illness is such a big problem in society and I feel we all need to be better at understanding and being supportive. You never truly know what's going on in someone's mind. We as a society create monsters. A person can only take so much until they just snap. And Arthur definitely snapped. His message may not be entirely wrong and we can all agree with him on some points, but his actions certainly were wrong. Send in the clown..."
2573,The Joker 2019 shows far The Joker had come since his roles in the cheesy 1966 Batman. All guys like me that grew up with DC comics since early 1970s should give this movie a change. And who knows if Bird of Prey will surprise the Oscars next Winter.
2574,"--No review here, just an outpouring courtesy of JOKER--
This movie assaulted me. I saw the trailers this past year and thought it looked more ""Hill St. Blues"" than Gotham, with makeup applied by a palsied Marcel Marceau. Yellow underwear? Scoliosis? Mama/son bath time? An anorexic practicing his stomach vacuums? Vomit. Vomit. Vomit and Vomit some more! I thought 'Joker' would tread the same ground the others had before it, but it would be ESPECIALLY disgusting as it did so. I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING! ""Joker"" was fantastic and also very human, showing how little we need to flourish. Or how little denied can make us spoil. We don't need much. Just a few things: To know where we came from, to be good at something, to connect with others, and not to laugh alone.
I'm not going to try to offer a synopsis or a critique of the film because others have done that already and far better than I ever could've. Instead I'll just list the things that were on MY blown mind when the credits rolled. Courtesy of ""Joker"", Orderless:
1)How we came to exist. The time before we are born: we have to take our parents at their word concerning this time.
2)We all struggle, some of us with multiple handicaps. How many of us notice a strangers suffering only after its become an inconvenience to us?
3)Many of us are medicated. Take away the medicine, would you still be liked? Would you even care?
4)I believe neglecting your neighbor can make monsters. Not deceitful mothers, abusive stepfathers, community programs closed for lack of funds, or big pharmaceutical's big prices.
5)Monsters are made when we leave our neighbor to face it all ALONE.
I had this feeling (but to a lesser degree) the first time I saw ""Fight Club"". It's been a rebooted minute, lol. This film made me believe the world can't be improved until we stop seeing the entire and focus on the individual instead. A persons problems can be overcome. A country's is insurmountable. But but by bit. . . ?
What happens when the lame man realizes he can stand? Depends on if you neglected him or not I suppose. ""Joker"" is a ""comic book movie"", but the message is vital: ignore those in pain today and run the risk of them bringing pain to you tomorrow. We all want to laugh . . . until we don't."
2575,"Joaquin was great but the movie seemed muddled and in some instances, far fetched."
2576,Quite possibly the best movie in decades. Jaquin Phoenix is masterful and the story is insanely powerful. The cinematic display is also fabulous.
2577,"Joker is a movie that many have been talking about this year, and I'm not sure if all that talk is justified. Joker is a fine movie: it has a good lead performance, a good score, good cinematography, some quiet moments of subtlety, and it comments on topical issues that give the film some relevance. But beyond that, there isn't much to say about the film. Narratively, it's fairly shallow and simplistic. The overall message of the movie is so simple that this film does not really owe itself to rewatch value, nor do I think it would hold up after one watch.This film has been called a rorschach test by its lead star, Joaquin Phoenix, and I would certainly agree with him, but not in a positive way. I do agree that think it is up to the viewer to interpret something deeper out of the story, but that is not because the story is smart, but rather because of how simple it is. Arthur Fleck is a mentally-ill person who gets stepped on by everyone around him. Eventually, he takes control of his life, murders some people, and becomes the Joker.There is nothing wrong with having a simple story, but when every character besides the main character is cartoonishly one dimensional, and when the dialogue is this on the nose, it makes it harder to take this message seriously. The only really memorable character in the film is Arthur himself. Everyone else, from his neighbor across the hall, to his psychiatrist, to Murray, to Arthur's work friend seem to only exist to be thorns in Arthur's side. The movie is strangely repetitive as we are introduced to these four figures in Arthur's life in one scene only to have them betray him in one way or another in the next. This is what I mean when I say the film is simplistic.Every character and plot beat in the film is against Arthur. The film does not have any smarter way of generating sympathy for Arthur other than making him a punching bag. I think the reason some praise this film while others hate it is because of their ability or inability respectively to relate to the main character. If one relates to Arthur being an outcast, then they can probably find a lot of themselves inside the hyper-exaggerated craziness of the main character. If one does not relate to Arthur, or if one finds his passiveness to be uncompelling, then the film becomes rather dull.As for me, I was mesmerized by Joaquin Phoenix's performance and I was most happy when the movie let the visuals speak for themselves. As I said before, I found the dialogue in this film rather on the nose, so when the film presents no-dialogue sequences of Arthur dancing, or doing weird stuff like climbing into the fridge, I enjoyed the film. I wish the script had more faith to leave things up to the audience. Instead of just making Arthur the ultimate victim, I think the story would have been more interesting if there were some things that were Arthur's fault and some things that weren't. The closest thing I can think of is Arthur getting fired because he had his gun on him, but the film presents it in a way where Arthur's coworker is really responsible for him having the weapon.The film is clearly heavily inspired by Martin Scorsese films like Taxi Driver and King of Comedy, and sadly it is not as thought provoking as either of them. I normally hate the ""this movie isn't very good because this other movie did it better"" argument, as that can be the case for virtually every film. But for this movie, I think comparing it to Martin Scorsese films is justified because not only does the film itself make numerous references to these two movies, but the director ToddPhillips constantly mentions those films being direct influences. Certain scenes, like Arthur idealizing Murray, having a supportive girlfriend who may or may not actually care, and being rejected by countless individuals is straight out of King of Comedy; and Arthur feeling like an outsider to society is clearly reminiscent of Taxi Driver. While Taxi Driver focused on the mentally-ill, prostitutes,There's nothing wrong with being inspired by other films, but the problem with Joker is that most of its substance is entirely derived from those films. When entire subplots just feel like updated versions of films from the '70's and '80's, I can't help but feel a little unengaged. This movie does add some interesting elements to the usual ""man goes mad"" formula, but it does not go in any new directions.I thought the idea of framing Joker's rise as a class war between the rich and poor of the city was a very smart choice. It is very relevant and different from its influences. I just wish that more was explored with how Arthur felt about his followers. It's interesting because Arthur is someone who doesn't care about money; he specifically says he isn't political and yet all the people in clown masks are using his image to make a political statement. I wanted to see what Author felt about that, how he felt still being an outcast even among people that dress and worship him. But we don't really get into that. He just seems vaguely happy when he sees clown-folk, and it's upsetting because I think the movie could have further explored its isolation themes and shown how blind followers are probably not the best catharsis for being alone. It felt strange how Joker just embraced being among people who didn't understand him.Another subplot I enjoyed but could have used more of was Arthur's imaginary girlfriend. I wasn't sure what the point of this entire subplot was. Is it to show that Arthur's lonely? Because we kind of understand that from the very start of the film. Is it to show that he's crazy? Because we understand that as well. The film doesn't have a real conclusion for this either. Arthur learns he's been imagining things, goes to the real girls apartment, and then just goes about his day. I genuinely don't understand why the imaginary girlfriend was included. At first I thought it was so Arthur could have someone to talk to, but they don't talk about anything really complicated. I think it's just another way for the simplistic script to make Arthur abandoned by someone.There are other subplots that feel strangely undercooked as well. While Thomas Wayne I thought was well-integrated, everytime Bruce Wayne showed up it took me out of the film. Comic book stuff just does not dwell with this grounded drama. Whenever the film went out of its way to show yet another murder of the Wayne parents, it felt like a studio note. It's like if you were watching Taxi Driver and then all of a sudden Aquaman showed up. Something as over-the-top as Batman just does not belong in this universe, and it was extremely distracting.Even though this review has been largely negative so far, it is important to talk about what works for me. The score by Hildur Guðnadóttir is fantastic. The quiet scenes where the score gets to convey Arthur's inner conflict work wonderfully. She's won many awards for her score, and its certainly deserved.The cinematography was also quite spectacular. There are many memorable shots and camera movements and it contributed a lot to why I thought the movie was good at the very least. My favorite shots include Arthur on the train with his head against the window, and Arthur climbing into the refrigerator.The lead star is also impressive. This isn't Joaquin Phoenix's best performance, but it is still impressive and it helps carry the film. Joaquin adds so much to the movie, and as I've learned, some of the more subtle moments of the film were completely improvised. Scenes of him dancing in the bathroom or climbing into the refrigerator were all smart, visual moments of conveying the journey Arthur was going on. Like I said, if the film had more moments like these, that didn't cram the message down the viewer's throats and let the audience think for themselves, I think the film would have been a masterpiece.As it stands, Joker is good, but nothing more. It is a well-acted, well-shot film with a decent enough structure of a man taking control of his life. It doesn't fully explore its themes and it owes so much of its existence to Scorsese, that it is hard to say it stands on its own. The viewer has to take it upon themself to give this film value. For me, I enjoyed the ride and it was entertaining enough even if some things left me unsatisfied. It certainly stands apart among the comic book genre (even if it really isn't a comic book film at all), and if it helps introduce people to smarter films of a similar vein, then I suppose it's hard to be mad at that."
2578,A hard to look at mirror on how society handles mental illness and how we tend to treat people that strike us as odd with cruelty. I'd like to think I've become a better human being with a greater capacity for empathy after watching this film. A contemporary masterpiece.
2579,"Joaquin Phoenix take a bow. Astonishing for him to match Heath Ledger as Joker.On the actual movie - Screenplay, Cinematography and Bgm are incredible. But the extremely depressing tone of the movie was a little off for ""my taste""."
2580,Perfect example of a person reaching their limit! Great performances by all the actors especially Joaquin Phoenix one of my favorite actors! Def a MUST see
2581,"I do acknowledge that there was great effort that Phoenix put into the role, especially the weight loss.But a vast majority of this character study asks the filmmakers to express visually and verbally what is happening mentally. Film is a demanding medium where you have to constantly keep the train moving. And to dwell on long verbal exchanges to pinpoint the character would not be acceptable to an audience. But was needed to approach a more authentic portrayal.A sliver of that was when at the hospital he vaguely admitted the three murders on the subway. Thought it would bother him but didn't. Where it wasn't done was after he realized the girlfriend was a delusion. No real reaction.An unrelated attempt was Negan from The Walking Dead. There were glimpses of reason in the writing but the character started off so annoying, it was a failure from the start.Although a completely different tone, Heath Ledger's Joker take was more interesting and compelling. He was already in the madness but you had a sense of pain in his past.To me, it felt that Phoenix was struggling much of the time. The ""dancing"" was the quick way to add an uncomfortable visual to the character. The laughter didn't seem right as was more annoying than uncomfortable. Someone like him went towards a need for power in our lives, like anyone. There was never really any instances of weakness, asking for help and being fearful of losing everything. All that was left for Phoenix was to accentuate the lesser, but visual, elements of the character. Sometimes those were over the top.So the story was a series of incidents that started to tear away at that ""power."" If anything, what I saw was a series of coincidence. Just going to the next and next and next until the eventual break. I didn't get the feeling of a gradual descent into madness. He was already significantly mentally ill and didn't get worse. He was just shown he didn't have any power to begin with and thus made a decision to go the route he went.A couple quibbles of details was Randall gave Arthur a gun as one character and then ended up suddenly another. Arthur pointing the finger at Randall as owning the gun was forced.The mother ends up as previously being very mentally ill. But I saw no sign of that in the portrayal of her in present day.Also the detectives said they found out Arthur asked someone if he could buy a gun. That was not shown. Was that Randall trying to sell a lie to the cops?Arthur's ""relationship"" with Sophie didn't ring true and I clearly knew there was something wrong. So if they wanted that to be a surprise when it was shown to be a delusion, it didn't work. Also, Arthur didn't seem to demonstrate other visual delusions.Surprised I was disappointed. It did try hard to shoot for the stars."
2582,So i have seen this a few times at this point and let me tell you its not anywhere close to being the last! The way this movie plays out is just amazing and the level of acting is something you almost never come by!! Im so happy this movie was made and the DC is on a path to greatness! I atleast hope so!!
2583,"One of the best movies I have seen
Make sure you are concentrated or you will not understand the movie"
2584,"Joker is hard to watch at times. I actually cringed a few times. It is so well acted by Phoenix. The setting is dark dingy and feels sick like the character. I liked getting the back story of the man that becomes Joker and his sad descent into madness. His lonesomeness, metal instability and the lack of compassion that people showed to him all make it understandable. Although he is a violent maniac in the end- I was almost glad to see he had found his purpose and was finally liked. Good cannot exist without evil..."
2585,"I expected little with it being attached to DC.
I was wrong and wrong again. This the best 'origin story' movie I've ever seen. The movie did a good job of following his descent into madness and gave him sympathy.
Of course some folks will not like this but to me it makes the character complete. Total hate for the Joker would make him one dimensional and that would be typical DC. Hey Heather!
This ain't that movie"
2586,"This is ma masterpiece! this is the film we needed, but I am very sad that few people have appreciated and fully understood it"
2587,"People on the internet is the main marketing stream to this movie. Memes and quotes from this movie have taken over, driving other people to fall into the hype. Well, it's average. The only good thing about it is Phoenix, and when the actor solely grants a movie a 6 star review means that he was pretty amazing but the movie itself is really average. I'm not saying it's a waste of time, but just watch it away from the hype and you might actually enjoy it"
2588,"I come from Israel and I still live in Israel.
Amazing movie there is something Jewish in this movie."
2589,"Classes between rich and poor will collide. The poor will take from the rich. This movie is reality of such. Well done, acting super, cinematography super, score super. Violence in comparison to other violent movies was not at a maximum yet graphic yes. If you can't handle it watch The Lion King."
2590,"Technically there's nothing wrong with this movie. Phoenix's acting deserves all the praise, beautiful photography, etc.From beginning to end, the movie is crowded with cinematic old clichés and rather cheap tear jerkers showing the downfall into madness of a very unfortunate man, which ultimately seems like a starved up pale attempt to pair itself as a film to brilliant pieces like The Shining, Taxi Driver or Cruise.This movie really doesn't show any version I've known of The Joker, none. Since creator's Jerry Robinson's 1951 version up to Alan Moore's work for DC Comics in 1988, The Joker character developed in a certain direction that could have been amazing to explore in a more artistic way than previous DC films, instead this movie looks like the last assignment of an art student did before graduating, with enough money to hire DeNiro and Phoenix, but that's far from being such a breakthrough art film."
2591,"I am the Joker. That's the perspective from which you watch the movie. And it gets incredibly real and disturbingly true to the way a person ends up becoming psychotic, as most people would call it, but I prefer to call it socially transformed. It is indeed a violent movie, but it is the movie of the decade. Phoenix and Todd Phillips deserves Oscars. And that's all needs to be said."
2592,Loved it to the max. Joaquin Phoenix deserved his golden globe. Without his performance the movie may have lacked star power or a gripping lead.
2593,"The movie itself was a little slow going, but the character development and the acting by Joaquin Phoenix, second to none! Critics very much so got this one wrong."
2594,"Great Movie
Joker was good
Directing was good
Awesome
Watched it three times
..."
2595,"I don't think enough critics understand the concept and the style of this movie because they thought the movie was too dark and too violent, If you see the reviews for this movie, don't listen to them, watch it! Because ""Joker"" is one of the best comic book films I've seen in 2019 since ""Endgame"".
Joaquin Phoenix was excellent as the Joker, everytime you hear him laugh, you know you're in for a great time, Robert De Niro is also in this movie and that's exciting to hear about. The cinematography, the score, the acting, the atmosphere of Gotham, everything about this movie is amazing.
I did heard some people talk about of how the movie's similar to ""Taxi Driver"" and ""The King of Comedy"", and yes I could see that, and to me it makes me want to watch ""Taxi Driver"" for the first time, I never seen ""The King of Comedy"" though, but I might later.
Although, what people are most talking about is the level of violence in this movie, and yes I know it could very controversial to hear about and it could inspire a person to do it, and it happened before, but come on guys, It's JUST a movie, everything about the violence is set-up behind the production.
Overall, ""Joker"" is an amazing film with beautiful cinematography, amazing score and an amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix, This is easily one of the best comic book films I've ever seen.Score: 10/10 ---- Highly Recommended"
2596,"If you're on the fence like I was thinking it was hype and almost didn't watch it, you must!Dark knight doesn't even compare and the way it's tied into the beginning of Batman is amazing!Hands down the best movie in the Batman universe ever made, hoping for more from this director."
2597,"It seems like, now a days, that, every 10 (or so) years a movie is made that makes me speechless. Especially regarding the feeling and point it makes to me. Often other aspects of the movie and its design, cinematography, direction and costume design et.c. just does it true purpose of being there without beeing noticed or up in your face, in other means, perfect.
It hurts a bit in my soul watching this movie. Thats not a common thing for me."
2598,"A real movie. Good dialogues, perfect actuation. We need more like this. I mean MORE."
2599,No comment ... Who can said this movie is boring or garbage .. Of course this is the best movie in 2019 ... Thanks DC Universe
2600,"Joker is a dark movie which is a combination of both the Origin of the Joker and a journey inside the Joker's mad mind. I love how the villain is the Main Character and how he can carry his own movie like he's an even bigger star than Batman. To be honest you never even think of the Batman because the film is so fully centered on the titular character.Joaquin Phoenix does the best performance of his life and is flawless in his performance with insanity, agony and just every detail that is the Joker.
The movie is not flawless: Phoenix kills as the Joker, the production value, effects, sound, music and everything is fantastic but the story does have an uneven script in several aspects:1. What is real and what is in Arthur's head os not clear enough: For exampl, it was obvious that the love story between Arthur and his neighbour was all in his head but this wasn't shown until much later.
2. The ending: OK, so was the entire story all in his head? Or was he comitted after the movie took place? Did he somehow kill the woman in front of him? The ending is just thrown in and makes little sense due to lack of explanation.The complaints I have is of course nitpicking on an overall fantastic movie. It's worth the watch for Phoenix's act alone and he raises the overall quality to an incredible level."
2601,"So Joker is now at #26 in the list of top rated movies of all time in IMDb at the time of writing this. After watching the movie I critically examined the top 25 movies that are ahead of Joker right now, and concluded a few can actually go ahead of this - a very few. And movies like The Dark Knight, The Silence of the Lambs, Fight Club and a few others may not be eligible for sitting ahead of Joker.All in all, Joker now onwards should be synonym of Joaquin Phoenix. With due respect, the age is Heath Ledger is gone. Joaquin cries, laughs, bleeds, runs, sweats, sings, dances and kills. Gives everything to create a towering character in the history of cinema, and in the history of movie acting. In each frame you can feel the pain of the deprived and dispossessed man. In each frame you can witness how a simple and chaste man can be transformed into a villain by the torments of the society when all of his tries go in vain.And finally we must congratulate Todd Phillips for this masterpiece and thank him for creating an eternal character here.
92nd Academy Awards:Best actor: Joaquin Phoenix
Best director: Todd Phillips
Best movie: Joker."
2602,"Just mail the man the Oscar, and while you're at it, do the same for the director."
2603,"I have never seen an actor give such an extraordinary performance as Joaquin Phoenix does here. A sure fire award winner imo,however,this film is so dark and oppressive I found it hard to watch.Worth watching for the acting."
2604,"Amazing acting! This guy deserves all the awards !!
J. Phoenix portrays Joker in an amazing way and it locks the audience in this emotional drama/tragedy. Great casting, wonderful compilation of music, amazing acting ! What can we say? He deserves the academy award in every possible way ."
2605,This was just an incredible origin story that was made so believable by the amazing acting of Joaquin Phoenix. He gives you the creeps throughout the whole movie and just has an amazing physical and emotional delivery culminating in exactly where the Jokers origins should be. No crazy CGI or supernatural origin... just one crazy guy put in a crazy world and mixed together with the right amount of stirring the pot !
2606,"It's one of the best movies of 2019. Joaquin Phoenix is a shoe in for best actor at the Oscars. The movie is dark....this is true, but it takes you into the life of the Joker. This isn't your action flick as in most Batman movies. This is a window for looking in on how the Joker comes to life. As I already wrote the acting is superb.My verdict....it's a very good movie. Go and see it!"
2607,"Hello there ...Todd Phillip's Joker is here to hit you with a smile stronger than a thousand fists,A realistic depiction of an iconic Cartoon character , strongly influenced by masterpieces of the past , If you were amazed by movies such as Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver and King of Comedy , then you are in for a treat , but does it stop there?Absolutely not, Phillips managed to combine landmark storylines from the myths cartoon artists gave us, such as Alan Moore's The Killing Joke with classic cinema masterpieces in modern society while he takes us in a deep dive of society's everyday problems and psychology, he dresses his movie with an outstanding soundtrack by talented young composer Hildur Guðnadóttir (she also gave us the score to drama miniseries Chernobyl ),and a colorful cinematography, creating something new and sadistically beautiful because you can't help yourself but to fall in love with the main character although you know he is the bad guy ... or is he not?It's already a classic, and I dare to say a landmark because I believe is going to be a great influence for future movies,of course Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal stands as one of the greats in cinema history , is Joker sane or crazy , is he a product of society or his twisted imagination, a criminal mastermind or a straw dog? maybe he is all of the above ... this movie will leave you with mixed feelings and a lots of thoughts ... it gets deep in you and makes you think what makes us human ... is it a smile always true , is it happiness ? and yet no matter how hurt you are there is always a rainbow after the storm ..."
2608,"Todd Phillips JOKER tale is fantastic! Well written, blend of Taxi Driver and The Killing Joke if you ask me. Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar nod for his portrayal. Those of us from the Bronx will see and recognize a lot of our neighborhoods as it becomes the new Gotham. Can't say enough about how much I loved the direction Todd Phillips took in giving us a different take on the Batman/Joker storyline."
2609,"And I don't use that label lightly. I've rated a couple hundred movies on IMDB and very few have I rated this high. Maybe two? Literally my only complaint is that it didn't go on longer. I watched it with my family (18 to 52) and ""more please"" was the strong sentiment. Just beautifully scripted, acted, directed, and filmed. Not a single misstep as a film. Bravo! (Not a movie for kids under 14)"
2610,"Cant say too much other than this is my favorite movie this year and possibly for a while. amazing acting, and directing!
Rarely, have I heard a symphonic instalment as good as this."
2611,"Not as disturbing as people claimed, expected more but nonetheless, a wonderful movie well written and acted, now part of my collection👌🏾"
2612,Joker is a movie in a guy's head. He makes us pity him and that was the joke. (I just get the joke)
2613,"I've watched most of Joachin Phoenix films, most have been wierd and underwhelming, Even though underneath it all he's obviously a very talented actor. I've always felt he's just picked not so great films to act in with not so great story lines or dialogue. Joachin Phoenix shines throughout this movie and truly shows what a very talented actor he is. I actually cant imagine anyone else to have played Joker,too even remotely as well as Joachin Phoenix.This film is triumphant and although I did go in expecting it to be a decent film, as it had pretty good reviews. I was gripped right from the beginning to the end with some edge of the seat scenes and it was a lot better than I was expecting to be honest. The storyline his character were good also, but it would not have worked so well with anyone else playing Joker. The very sad part of this film,like being let down by society is actually true as I've seen it first hand. I'm not talking about the USA, but the United Kingdom and it's getting worse as were sadly turning into an I'm alright jack society. Where mostly people just think about themselves which makes this film even more real to me. Anyway I'm rambling ,I actually agree that this film is a masterpiece and I'm not a fan usually of DC films. I think this film will be Joachin Phoenix's greatest success story as I cant see him topping this purely raw but superb movie. It would be nice now to see another Batman movie vs the Joker maybe Christian Bale as Batman and of course Joachin as Joker. I think that would be another film worth watching. Go watch it and enjoy an acting performance of a lifetime."
2614,"At first I never wanted to watch the movie .. Superheros and Villains are not my thing
The trailer was released and I watched it and I've never been excited to see a movie
IT IS A MASTERPIECE"
2615,"Phoenix delivers such a tour de force about mental illness, in a funny, yet painful metaphor of our society today. He embodies mental disease in a terrifying performance, which gives rise to the worst and best villain, while imagined, this world has ever created. His take on The Joker is fearful for its honesty and realism, and how believable that such a reality could create a monster in today's world. Hats off."
2616,"When I first saw the 'Joker' in ""The Dark Knight"" I fell in love with the character, because of his somewhat correct motives and the way he thinks. I had never seen a character like him before in any movie, which made it so new and refreshing to watch. When the ""Joker"" movie was announced I was stunned. Especially when I noticed Joaquin Phoenix was going to take on the role of the Joker. An actor that in my opinion is one of the greatest - if not the best - performers of the 20th century. Sr. Phoenix is so good at taking on roles that most people wouldn't want to take on because of how horrifying, haunting or psychologically difficult they are. As someone who absolutely loved Heath Ledger (may he rest in peace) as the Joker, I was extremely curious about Joaquin's performance when I was waiting in the theater for the movie the start. I was not disappointed, not at all. Sr. Phoenix performed beyond my expectations. To me it felt like Joaquin actually transformed 'himself' into the character which gave the personage a very realistic and terrifying touch. The story allowed this character to feel even more real, by placing him in a world that could - if not already - be real and making him face obstacles that people might actually be facing daily. As if there is a deeper message and meaning behind the story. It is very difficult to describe my thoughts on this movie, but that's what so great about it. It allows you to think for yourself. At the end of the movie, every single person in the theater probably thought of a different ending or reason for certain keypoints in the film. It wasn't just a casual ""good guy bad guy"" story, not at all.I rate this movie 10/10 because to this day I do not seem to be able to sum up any negative points in this movie. I enjoyed it, I will enjoy it many more times and I highly recommend you to give it a shot as well if you haven't yet - because it might just change your whole perspective on cinematography."
2617,"Loved this show
Great character development
Joaquin was amazing"
2618,"Good movie. Reflected DC universe.
Watched twice. Has Younger version of Bruce Wayne."
2619,"Wow, that was an experience of a film. It's rare for a film to live up to its hype, even rarer for it to surpass it and my God didn't this movie just do that. The grit and feel of the film is something that is a wonder to watch with tremendous storytelling and what is a truly astounding performance from Phoenix. His portrayal of the Joker was quite rightly always going to be compared to Heath Ledgers magnificent portrayal and I, along with many many others, suspected it could not be done again. How wrong I was, Joaquin is truly unbelievable in this film, you can actually believe he has completely gone insane, just broken from the crooked system we live in. It is so strange how relatable the character is as anyone who has fell on hard times probably has gone through struggles that no one deserves and highlights so many problems in our modern day society. This is honestly one of the best films ever and is something really special, just sit back and enjoy.......and smile"
2620,"As everyone else has said... Phoenix is brilliant, great acting and was glued throughout. But this could of been called something else, raising awareness of mental health...However, Bruce Wayne is a child in this film and that would make Joker and old man by the time Batman arrives on the scene, not really following comic book stories. I expected an action film with the joker we all know, but it definitely is not. Decent film still."
2621,Absolutely disturbingly Incredible!!!! Joaquin did an amazing job. Wheewwww..
2622,"When for the first time I heard of the movie JOKER is being releasing and is by WB, I was anticipating for it as I was waiting for such movie or a character who is a Psychologically moved and does everything his own - Doesn't care of anybody to get attention to his who just does his work.And this movie was quite in news when it was confirmed to be released.
I just watched it now but sorry guyz, it doesn't met my expectations.By the meaning of 'Expectations', from the Posters like he looking in the sky opening his hands; that feels like the source of self-motivation and living the life without caring of anybody's feeling.The scene in the trailer too, that the Joker ( Arthur ) makes his face as a 'laughed one' with his fingers and the blue tear coming from his eye. That's just amazing combination of laughing when he is crying !The Movie --The starting is Naiceee with the scene of the theme of the movie but as it goes ahead, it loses the storyline... I mean where is the story? A man who is Psychologically disturbed and in 2/3 of the movie is shown his work of just killing the three people and some protest of the people and then his tries of getting people laugh, gets some personal animosity and finally gets in.. !
I mean what ?
Where is the this which makes a Joker a Joker... ?The tight part of the movie starts slowly after Arthur kills his mother. That was really a violent but that maybe shows some of the glimpse ( we can say ) of the joker.After how he kills one of his friends in his house with the scissors... yeah that make a joker, but not, the whole movie was just wasted.
I am not saying that the movie should not contain the history or the background of him as how he came up here... Even I say the background of the character is the most interesting part but only if it is well developed.If he is the psycho or gets the one, it should be in the background or in his history how he came up with.In starting, he gives the card to the woman saying not to mind his as he laughs and can't stop it... and the he gets hurted by the group of boys for not giving the board back, and the starting stuff was really interesting... And that lasts it Arthur kills three people in the train ( yes the train scene was to be appreciated )
. After that the movie looses its weigh.In last when he gives the speech in the live show was the great as he was describing his life's point of view and his experiences throughout the life.
But repeatedly I say that - THAT such kind of thing should be in whole movie; like his likes and his attitude towards the society.When he kills the host of the show with the gun, was WOW... but Why can he bring his gun to anywhere ... ? How can he ? I think no one is checking him before going to anywhere. ( maybe he would have killed the Wayne in the Bathroom with his gun ! )
But hey, he acted Amazingly.
It really really feels like he can only be the joker.
The cinematography was the best all the color gradients and tones for mood .
Direction was too... but it was just a lack of a story writing.Needed some kind of the music in the background which played when he comes on the frame... Some kind of music that fits in the brain of the joker lovers and play repeatedly even for the motivation! ( What we do with the Batman rises' soundtrack )All I want to say is, whatever they showed in the last 1/3 of the movie, should be in the whole movie.( I don't get that why have they related this Joker with the Batman begins' joker story... ? Why a person kills Bruce Wayne's parents in the way showed in the batman.. ?If they really want to relate the joker with the one in the batman, then that joker had a background in which his father cut his lips... but in this Joker isn't !No guyz you can't relate... )But This movie was the first step in making the movie of the joker isolated.
Better version is Expected with above suggested advises."
2623,"I hope Joaquin Phoenix.
He did wonderful acting, And I guess he is a joker now.
I loved it, I could not even blink during this amazing masterpiece."
2624,"Delusional film enriched with horrifying acting.
Everyone thought it would be a prototype of dark knight joker. But it is better than an Oscar movie. The story is incomplete they should make part 2. Hell this is the best film and unique genre related to fight club. Best of 2019"
2625,"A movie that borders on genius-repellant, dark, terrifying, disgusting, brilliant and unforgettable."
2626,"Out of the slew of modern waves of superhero films with tons of CGI and action, clear cut good guys and bad guys comes Joker, a smart, more arty, surprisingly deep villain's rise to evil.Now let's be clear while I did state there is no 'woke' propaganda, or shoving a fake political message that's clearly made by idiots who don't know what real issues are. There is a political statement in this film, the only difference is that this message is REAL, it's about how society treats mental illness (having seen it being blatantly ignored and written off as white privilege or some other made-up crap) , how the system treats mental illness and what it can incite.This is a slow film, it doesn't shove action into your face it has tight cinematography, a tight script, a pitch black sense of humor, and absolutely fantastic character acting from Joaquin Phoenix. The film also once again sets up the story of Batman with Bruce's parents being killed, though this time it's in the middle of a riot instead of a robbery gone wrong.I rarely give films a full 10/10 but this film EARNED it. WATCH IT"
2627,"This movie made me feel so emotionally uncomfortable, and extremely sympathetic with Joker. The story has a devastating twist which was so unexpected and shocking. The Joker movie is filled with dystopia of our world and really make you think of how faulty our society is."
2628,"JP is the best actor of his generation,and this movie has everything you ever wanted in a movie, RIP Marvel Avengers ,maybe endgame made more money ,but Joker rules everything else."
2629,"We all know that Joaquin is one of the best but with this...there is only one ""best"" now."
2630,"Joker is directed by Todd Phillips and star Joaquin Phoenix, Zazie beetz, and Robert De Niro. This movie is astonishing. The acting, cinematography, story, etc. I absolutely love this movie for all those things. Joaquin is the perfect joker, and i also love what they did with the joker character, it was something new for the joker, having a mental illness, that's what makes him do these horrible things and you want to root for Arthur but he does these horrible things that make you not want to root for him. This movie is suprisingly a pychological thriller. This movie makes you think certain things are real but they turn out to be non-existent, which make for some really amazing scenes. Speaking of scenes, the last two scenes of the movie are amazing! When you see the joker put on a bloody smile its a symbol that he is finally letting go, he does'nt care anymore, he does'nt want to be treated like trash anymore, and now he wont. And the last scene will mess with your head, i can't tell if this whole joker thing was all in his head or if he was arrested and put in a mental institution. Another thing that might mess with your brain is that Thomas Wayne could have had an affair with Arthur's (maybe) mother, and Arthur could be half brothers with Bruce Wayne, and Arthur's mother might have not been crazy like we thought. Lets talk about the preformences, Joaquin is mesmerizing, he did an amazing job bringing this character to life. Zazie's character plays an interesting role in this movie, Arthur thinks for a while that they are couple but soon he would find out that its all in his head. So this whole movie could have just been in his head, which was not what i was expecting but i was pleasantly surprised by it. Overall this movie is definitely my favorite movie of the year. I'm going to give Joker, an A+. If you a DC fan i'm sure you will have a blast with this."
2631,"Honestly, Arthur should have lived a happy life. He had a big department and didn't need to repay huge loans. Government offered free psychiatrist. Hospital sent their emergency service at time, even before the patient's son arrived at his home. Policepersons are nice, they don't beat you until you committed a crime which you never did. You can even meet the most famous billionaire and instead of throwing you on the street, he was willing to talk to you and explained it personally. This is not Gotham, it's paradise."
2632,"A well directed movie. Director really planned this movie. Amazing acting....we can't compare this joker character with Heath Ledger joker character.
Both are two different characters.
I really loved this film. Just good to watch"
2633,"Great explicit movie, dark at times, but truthful and completely eventful in the truth of life, insanity, purity, and the wonder of what happens to the human mind when left alone. Politically acclaimed, hits home, and overall just.. GREAT. 10/10 recommendation if you're ready for a true divisive and inclusive experience."
2634,Yes the acting was good (surprised to learn the same actor in one of my top 10 movies Gladiator) the way the story progresses is what kept me watching. It has surprising twists along the way l think that's needed as it's a long movie.There are links to the batman movie l don't think some of these links were convincingly executed. I think the suffering Phoenix experiences is entirely possible there are cruel people in the world. l found his laughter funny but then l realised it wasn't suppose to be funny. That was weird for me as l had to stop myself from laughing.I think this movie was a bit overhyped though it's something you watch once. It's a depressing and dark movie about mental health (some 'violent' scenes being uncomfortable) it's not something I'd want in my top 10 of movies or even consider buying for my collection. For a top 10 movie l ask myself would l watch it again and again and the answer is definitely not.
2635,"Dark, depressing and thought provoking. Joaquin's performance is stunningly perfect. He is the embodiment of Joker."
2636,"At first I thought it was a real depressing villain to be movie until I watched it. Joaqin Phoenix indeed made this movie bloom. His acting in this movie is so outstanding that I never got bored all the way through. I fell asleep on Hobbs and Shaw cx it is predictable, lol but not this movie with joaqin Phoenix. This is what I call a real class acting."
2637,"Best film I've seen all year, not what I expected, it was better. It actually makes you feel sorry for his character who has always been known as the villain. Its one of those films where you watch it and don't really appreciate how good it was until you start talking about it, its a must watch in my opinion."
2638,"It's not often that such a well known, iconic character can be brought to life and be successful through a different interpretation. While Heath Ledger's Joker had outstripped previous attempts to portray The Joker in a realistic (non-cartoon) format, I would say that Joaquin Phoenix's takes it way beyond that portrayal."
2639,"I can't make this up, the movie shows for itself! It is so captivating. I saw it last night and already wanting to go see it again. I'm not going to spoil it, you just have to see for yourself!"
2640,"Acting, cinematography, the music, the whole effect and the whole movie is so dark that it litrally makes you forget the light, indulge and soon you find yourself in the crowd, cheering, laughing and just feeling found."
2641,"I like this , i love this , best charecter ,best casts and best director ,best production and best music ,thanks"
2642,Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips come through in one of the greatest renditions of a well-known comic villain's life story
2643,Like all great art Joker is a poetically poignant masterpiece. Kudos to everyone involved.
2644,"Joker is a film that dares and it really tries hard to get things righ. N by golly it does showing the slow descent into madness as well as the slow loss of identity and humanity Arthur losses his mother father girlfriend until all he's got left is his joker identity. Phoenix's performance makes this film what it is, he is absolutely phenomenal. But it isnt just the acting in this film it's the gorgeous cinematography stunning locations and brilliant score my god this film does so much right and definitely deserves your time and praise."
2645,"You see when you you look at your life you see big problems around you. An unkowned future dark future fear of future and now we see how Joker deals with this vision and how problems land on his life!, his career his mother....
Nothing nothing in his life makes him happy
The Soul creates such a big connection with this type of human with this type of life
Good job everyone maybe one day gobernments disappear maybe one day they collapse maybe all those thing john lenon said will happen maybe one day.. Just imagine"
2646,"Absolutely incredible performance. He played the ""flawed"" character flawlessly. Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix will be remembered for Joker. I really hope both win the Oscars."
2647,"MASTERPIECE! Such a great movie, and well preformed from start to finish. Joaquin Phoenix does an outstanding job on his performance. Not gonna lie, some scenes gave me chills. Overall, great film!! 10/10."
2648,This is the most incredible performance i have seen in my whole life
2649,Get to your local cinema now and don't waste time! One of the best cinematic experiences in my 37 year existence.
2650,"""Joker"" is a psychological thriller film based on the origins of DC comics villain character of The Joker. Following similar themes to ""The Killing Joke"" comic, a failed stand-up comedian who turns to a life of crime and chaos in Gotham City.So Joaquin Phoenix will go down in history as the second best Joker in the Batman live-action cinematic universe, I don't think anyone will ever top Heath Ledger. But second best is still pretty good, especially when playing such an iconic character. He embodied the character, not just in manneristic insanity but also in physicality. Wow he looked sick in this film and it made me uncomfortable! You feel for Arthur's character throughout most of the film, though this shifts when murder starts to rear its ugly head. The film made his constant being targeted of harassment and violence so over the top, it wasn't entirely believable but Gotham has always been the city that no one should move to.The film was shot beautifully, I loved the shots on the staircase. We get a dreary looking city contrasted by Arthur's attire by the end of the film which was great. Also the entire talk show sequence was fantastically done. It's raw, uncomfortable, shocking and right up the Joker's alley. All the problems I had with the film have to do with certain plot points themselves. We did not need the entirely obvious ""hallucination"" plot twist of Sophie. It was unnecessary and could've been utilized to continue the descent into Joker territory. I was fine with his laugh being deemed a disorder and his mothers neglect shaping who he is, but ultimately I would've liked to see more of the ""wanting to watch the world burn"" mentality from the character. Also his stand-up career never stood a chance in this universe.I loved the ending of this film. We have riots break out, madness ensues and it results in the iconic alleyway scene with Thomas and Martha Wayne's demise. The fact that the film kept the killer anonymous as a goon was perfect. I hate when writers try to make an infamous Batman villain the culprit when clearly that's not the point at all. Villainy can come from anywhere, and Batman should result from a random shooting not from the Joker killing his parents in the past. I was so worried that would happen, but it didn't so brava. The movie overall was enjoyable to watch, but it was right there on the edge of being great. With tweaking to the script it could've gotten there."
2651,"I am not a fan of Batman movies (though I have watched them all) and I really hated the Dark Knight movie. And the reason I hated it was the reason everyone loved it. It was Heath Ledger. His acting was the epitomy of abnoxious. It was sooo annoying to watch him. But then he died and everyone praised his acting even more.
I am not a fan of Joker either. When I saw this movie's trailer I was like Oh my here we go again. Another annoying movie.
I was not supposed to watch it. But after all the success and the reviews I decided to watch it, not in order to enjoy it but in order to see what everyone was talking about and have my own opinion.
I was shocked because instead of watching a mehh movie I watched a masterpiece.
I really do not understand why many governments banned this movie for people under 18 (it is not scary or gory) and I do not understand why people expected mass shootings or things like that.
This is JUST A MOVIE. Not scarier than other movies I have watched. It is a movie about people with mental illnesses and about people who are neglected by their country and authorities.
But what makes this movie really worth watching is Joaquin Phoenix. I like him as an actor but I never thought he was THAT good. He is excellent."
2652,An absolute masterpiece! The harmony between setting and music is flawless. Its a movie in which you loose your perception of reality and you start feeling for Arthur Fleck. You almost feel sympathy for the chaos he spreads...its his turn to start living. Joaquin is perfect in this movie..he deserves the oscar!
2653,This is the real joker. This is the origin of Gotham of Bruce of The joker (batmans). This is a movie of a kind. Just love it.
2654,"I gave it 3 just to even out the score some. If you want to see a mentally challenged man get beat up and abused and then bait people into doing it to him so that he can then murder them, this is the movie for you...Character development is painfully slow and awkward. If you're a weirdo or use a gender pronoun other than male or female, this movie is probably right up your alley."
2655,"Fisrt of all this is a nice movie, with a correct story and a very good acting.
But a little boring.The real question here is WHY did they change the Joker original story ?
It's a very strange choice from the producer.As usual in DC universe, they do not respect the original story AT ALL, and rewrite it from scratch around something less commun ""the madness of a man"" that's a shame because the orginal one is very good and deserve a movie who will expose the original Joker story in full.If you do not know the original story i advise to read "" The killing joke ""For me and my friends who know and follow the joker about 35 years now,
it is not the Joker. I do not reconize the joker at all into this movie, just a crazy clown who lost his mind. If you tint the hair of the man in red and put blue makeup into his face you can rename the movie the title you want.The creation of the Joker into the Batman universe are nothing to do with this movie. The original story is honestly way better.Another thing i do not like into this movie is the fact they never get the point of of view of the original Joker. For him madness is perfection. He do not want the people to mimic him, follow him and copy him. He do not initiate any revolution of any sort. He despise peoples and live only for himself.Into the original story Joker become Joker after his pregnant wife died and himself fall into a tank of chemical mixture. The green hair color and the white skin color are not makeup at all, they are the results of the chimical. After that his mind was broken.Into this movie it is just a simple man who take meds, and become nuts because life is hard with him. Even the laugh is a medical condition.
Sorry but it is not good at all. At this state everybody can become the Joker because life is not easy.Joker use crazy people and i say USE! to work for him.
Because normal people or outlaw do not want to be close to this man ""way to dangerous"". At the end of the movie there is clown everywhere !! Sure!! (apprently the producer do not even understand who the joker is)So, if you are a fan of the original joker, this movie is not for you.
If you seek a drama of a man falling into madness, this movie is for you."
2656,"If I watch this movie as a story of someone else than everything is fine and It is indeed a good movie, but I was expecting the real origin story of the joker how he fell into the chemical pool and becomes joker as we saw in Batman Bad Blood."
2657,"I'm too stunned to give this a 10/10 even though it is an absolutely perfect film in every way. I keep thinking it can't be as good as I think it is, it's too perfect.Even with all the hype, this film EXCEEDS expectations. Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing, and the film is gorgeous. It's gut wrenching and heartbreaking but so beautiful it's surreal."
2658,"A beautifully dark, and sometimes hard to watch film. You could even forgot you were actually watching Joaquin Phoenix, and that's a good thing, because you just felt and saw Arthur Fleck in the movie. Zazie Beets and Robert were mind blowing too. I loved it, every feel and second of it."
2659,"Joker is a dark, humour, bizarre and disturbing journey of Arthur fleck. Everyscene was like a filament in a bulb. Joaquin Phoenix - ur a monster💙 that laugh is as contagious as anything can get!Don't know about the oscars, but it was once in the lifetime performance by Joaquin Phoenix....and would remain in my heart for years & in my brain for days to come,,,may be.....The best portrayal of a psycho character that I have seen!"
2660,"Phenomenal. best movie I've seen in a long time. Never thought anyone would be able to play joker better than heath ledger, but Joaquin Phoenix was amazing. It's not a comic book story per say but an actual story of a man who's on the cusp of insanity and society just pushes him over the edge. It just seemed real, like i could fully imagine someone going through this very thing. I walked out and thought that a movie like that could start a revolution in real life. I could see people buying into and if i recall, some of the people protesting in Hong Kong were dressing up as joker as part of the protest. Not to overstate it, but I don't know that a movie has ever really touched me like that before. Who knows, you may see and just be like ""ehh"""
2661,The best movie i have ever seen best actor best director best soundtracks best everything
2662,Pheonix did a great job to pull the character with all its emotions and struggles. The film shows how discrimination makes a villain and also how easy it is to become a villain. Yeah its a dark film but you need the darkness to admire the light
2663,"Never seen a character development like this in
my life in any movie
all time top 3 movie ever
Joaquain for an Oscar
cant say any
it's other than
just get the popcorn and watch it!!!!!!"
2664,"Must add my comment on the historical momentBest movie at 2019, apparently !"
2665,"Oscar worthy peformance by Joaquin Phoenix in what is a intense, realistic take on the Joker character. Every shot in the film is masterfully crafted alongside an outstanding score. It can be hard to watch at times but this only adds to the film's brilliance. The themes throughout are very thought provoking and do in fact promote debate and discussion. Masterpiece!"
2666,"I saw this movie twice. Each time I left the theater with my stomach sore from clenching my muscles in anxiety over the main character's descent into madness. Joaquin Phoenix gives a chillingly compelling performance (think ""My Left Foot"" with Daniel Day Lewis) as a man who has ""not been happy one day of his life"" , yet has largely been a gentle outcast living in a cruel, violent world exploited by capitalist greed and corruption. The tie-in with the DC character Batman is cleverly revealed to be far more obtuse than earlier stories have made it, blaming the Joker for the murder of Bruce Wayne's parents. In this story, the Joker is turned into a murderer, but not THAT murderer.This is a film I will own on DVD when it is released in January. But do see it on the large screen if you can."
2667,"It is impossible to characterize this film otherwise. This is a work of art, thought out in detail and filmed. The film can not be liked, does not cause a desire to revise it, but you admire it. Despite all the tragedy, all the pain that is contained in each frame, the film really admires. Although most of the reviews, both critics and viewers, are positive, there are fierce disputes about the film: someone does not like it decisively, someone sees in the film only the Joker, the villain opposing Batman. For me, this film is primarily about people, about the need to always treat everyone humanely. ""No one owes anyone anything,"" I don't dispute that phrase, but even without doing anything good to a person, you can be kind to them the second your lives cross.""The Joker"" is a one-man story, as frightening as it is realistic. Everything in this film is natural. By saying ""naturally"" I don't condone the cruelties that the"
2668,"Oscar!
Great how the actor was transform for the movie and great the scene!"
2669,"Joker is a product of gothic society, an unequal, violent society in which the richs are the creators of the problematic, Joker does not act with a Marxist dogmatism, acts from the enormous surfeit and growth of the anger, Joker comes to question batman as a super hero, batman only defends the status quo of his class"
2670,"Joaquin Phoenix is truly Oscar worthy in this adaptation of Joker. He's gripping, troubled, believable and diverse, and I'm yet to watch a comic book adaptation as terrific as this.
Suicide Squad eat tour heart out. THIS is how a movie should be made."
2671,Amazing. Dark. Disturbing. All the right ingredients. Best movie in this category since the Dark Knight.
2672,"Being a prequel to the highly rated Badman movies you might expect a simple, effect driven prequel. But contrary to expectations, the story evolves naturally, interesting and well played by all actors.
To me, Joker turned out to be interesting, touching at times and exciting as it emphasises the psyche of the Joker and his emerging into violence. To the level that you might ask yourself who is to blame for the final raving madness. So, where Joker is a kind of caricature in the Badman movies, here he is a real life troubled person naturally evolving into violent madness. Joaquin Phoenix excels as he succeeds to portray both mental sides of his troubled persona and again, never turns the Joker into a caricature. I would not be surprised if Joaquin receives an Oscar nomination for his portrayal."
2673,"When I heard that they were doing another joker movie, I didn't care for it at all. I went to see it anyway, and I'm extremely happy I did. The storyline is great, but it's not necessarily new or out of the box. But ket me just say, the way this Movie was directed astonishes me! I have never seen a movie that was as greatly directed as Joker. It's a must see for everyone who is passionate about directing or if you just want a good watch!"
2674,"I can't remember the last time a film made such an impact on me.
Utterly moved ... Utterly disturbed... and fully memorized by the sheer genius which drenches every ounce of this masterpiece.
I will be haunted by this movie for the rest of my days and am certainly grateful to of had the pleasure of being a witness to this special moment in film history."
2675,"I wish I could see Philips and the guys in the editing room, when they started to realize what they have accomplished here.
I imagine they were dancing like crazy laughing and crying all at the same time.In one sentence, This movie for me is the peak of creativity."
2676,"Well he deserves an Oscar for this. It's very dark so not for everyone but the acting, filming & other details were so well done. Towards the end I had to remind myself that I wasn't watching Heath Ledger... an amazing homage paid to him. I'm sure he's smiling somewhere. Obviously it's fiction but shows the progression of how this could happen & does happen to people every day, the struggles they face with funding cuts etc. I loved this movie & felt so sorry for the joker despite the horrendous things he became capable of. Bravo👏🏻"
2677,"It's fun to see a movie this good on the big screen, but audience reactions, such as laughing at things that aren't intended to be funny can mess with the nuance and atmosphere of this film."
2678,"If there are cinematic masterpieces, this is the one! This isn't a mere villain's film. It's an alegory about today's society. Joaquin Phoenix masters the transformation inside a man's mind whose life has been delapidated. The whole soundtrack together with the direction convey these inner dark moments. The stairs, which Arthur finds so hard to climb near the beginning of the film, turn into a stage of his own glorious madness by the end of the film. Don't we all feel a bit of compassion and even empathy for a man who has been nothing but humiliated by the powerful and the rich? Isn't there a bit of the ""Arthur"" inside each and everyone of us? What will happen when we rise up to our comedy? Isn't this happening already?"
2679,I cried at the end of the film. I love you Joker. The message is too strong. I watched the film twice.
2680,I have never bothered to review a movie but this was such a tour de force of acting I felt I had to. This is without doubt the best acted movie you are ever likely to see. It is unbelievably good and a must see on the big screen.
2681,"If ever there was a role made for a master actor, one who can wring out the lurking, soulful depths of depravity and insanity, with such intensity it is spellbinding, it is Joaquin Phoenix. From Commodus to Johnny Cash to the guy who falls in love with Her to the incredibly overlooked role he played in Master, the range of this best there is professional is beyond description. His every move, every sound, every painful looking move of the emaciated body he lost 55 plus pounds to play grinds with the grit and scum of the streets of crushing New York. His descent into insanity is a work of art. His laughter was so intense and so biting it will cause nightmares. Others have played tormented minds with great success. Violent, yes. So is the endless bottom of the pit shoveled over to the bottom of the heap of society, one of which he plays to perfection. It's a dark movie. Going insane is dark. And you will witness it line by line and be mesmerized by what you see Phoenix doing in every scene. There is hardly any room in this film for any of the other good actors. Don't miss it."
2682,"I'm not really good at writing reviews, but I felt compelled to write a bit about this film. The acting is top notch, some of the best I have ever seen! The soundtrack is simply amazing, the story kept me hooked.I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't yet watched it, but the last act were Arthur is on the talk show had my heart beating out of my chest, I was holding my breath almost the entire scene!"
2683,"A film about the problems of the society, ignoring the vulnerable people. The character and the cause of his behavior is beautifully presented throughout the action. The movie's music is brilliant. I hope the movie wins at least one Oscar."
2684,"This movie was a masterpiece and i loved it, big fan of Joaquin Phoenix and for his great performance, he needs and deserves an oscar for once."
2685,"One of the best acting performances I have ever seen, simply flawless. This movie is perfection. The cinematography, script, setting, just an incredible piece of art that will be talked about for years to come.Just go and see it."
2686,This movie is simply amazing! Go and watch this movie in the cinema. This is an upper case movie!!
2687,"I'm seriously not a fan of the whole Marvel explosion of films that ,no matter how you view them , ends up being the same picture. This Warner Brother's film ,of the DC comic's top villain Joker, is nothing like any of those films. It's dark, depressing, bleak and extremely slow. Instead of letting the special fx's, fight scenes and testosterone filled action take center stage, it allows space for a mesmerizing acting performance by Joaquin Phoenix. Many are saying that he copied Deniro's performance in Taxi Driver, but I say that he honestly topped that performance by a mile. Deniro had no boundaries. Phoenix had to craft his performance within the boundaries of the comic book super villain named Joker, and he masterfully makes the transformation right in front of our eyes, within 120 minutes.The plot has been criticized for being heavy handed, but honestly the simple fact that we can have such a story still be relevant in 2019, shows that as a society we haven't been heavy handed enough. There are no happy endings in Joker. Some might say that it even glorifies or at least justifies the evils of the world. Maybe it does. But remember , the story ,like Phoenix's performance is bound by the DC story in the first place. If you have a problem with the bleakness , it might be because you are coming to the realization that at some point we will be Gotham because we are definitely following on the path of Gotham's past that this film represents.Overall, I don't know of a better Comic book film. As a matter of fact , it's the only comic book film of recent years that is Oscar worthy."
2688,"Everything in this movie represent with 100% accuracy world today.
Joaquin's performance is out of this world."
2689,Joker Is my most favourite comic book movie of 2019. The performances are amazing! I would be surprised if Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get nominated for an Oscar. The directing and story are great and I really liked the soundtrack. I never got bored watching this film. I can see why some people might not like it but I loved it. This is a win for DC. I hope they do more standalone films like this. This film transcends the genre and doesn't feel like a comic book movie. For some people that might be an issue but for me it works. I would highly recommend this film.9.5/10
2690,"What can we tell about Joker?. Nothing, is a masterprice. The only thing you have to do is sit down and watch the movie. You'll be watching a wonderful piece of the cinema."
2691,"They might as well go ahead and engrave Joaquin Phoenix's Oscar now, because, yes, he really is that good in this role. The movie wisely decides to tell the Joker's origin story in a fairly unfantastical and realistic way and his performance helps ground the entire movie. If I didn't know any better, I wouldn't have even known this was a superhero movie (or at least that it exists in the same world).Phoenix plays a socially awkward clown who just can't get a break. He's his mother's only caretaker and they both share a lot of equally insane delusions. She believes her former employer will, one day, come and bail them out of a life of poverty and he believes that he's destined to become a brilliant comedian despite telling horrible jokes. As the film progresses, his psyche begins to unravel and a violent chance encounter with a group of rich thugs turns him into a surprise hero for the underclass of the city.I'm sure you've heard that Joker is pretty much a Taxi Driver ripoff and it sort of is, but with a few different spins that make it worth a watch at least. It's not a masterpiece or a classic like many other have said only because it feels like it consists of characters, themes, and situations we've seen a million times before and done better at that. The film is worth seeing for Phoenix's unhinged, go for broke performance. It's a thing of beauty."
2692,"There are no words that can describe the very deepness of this movie. For some people, especially those who are struggling in their life and/or have depression, this movie can and will feel relate-able because the way you see Joaquin portraying the socially outcast character of Arthur Fleck makes you realize how toxic and broken societies are nowadays.There's no much CGI in this film, only pure acting which is quite impressive because it can compensate the lack of awesomeness and excitement usually found in action packed comic book films because you will be satisfied whilst having those goose-bumps when you observe Joaquin's performance."
2693,"I'm was not Phoenix fan until this movie. Truly one of the best, well acted, and visceral movies of the year. It's haunting, it makes you feel, and it makes you sympathize.... and you'll be thinking about the quotes and messages for days. It's true to the Joker... and even the negative critic reviews acknowledge that the movie makes you ""feel"". Awesome job all the way around. Loved the ending."
2694,"Like a train setting off slowly as it chugs away from its station of departure, this movie starts off slow, as it needed to, to create and develop the story of the Joker - a pre 'Batman' character enhancing psychopath.The movie continues and develops, grows, prospers and finishes crashing into the world of Joker as we start to know him in Batman.The movie itself is very clever, a very different take on the character. Atmospheric, & entertaining and pulls you into the world of a man that makes you understand how a 'man' like Joker comes to pass.Although, 'the' Phoenix has risen - he truly has become a special actor. Dare I say the best in the world currently? It takes a lot to go from fantastic to the elite level of special - I feel that a number of his performances have built up to this - and can't help but feel that this part was made for him.I heard a lot at chatter - is this a better performance than that of the late Heath Ledger? And well, yes it is.. Both performances are 'fantastic', Joaquin's however is just that bit more 'special'."
2695,Outstanding! So many comparisons have been made in regards to Heath and Joaquin's performance. I myself believe there is no comparison as both actors were incredibly brilliant in their own right. Love what Joaquin brought to the table!
2696,"""What did I just watch?"" was the first feeling when I walked out from the theater. I first saw this movie on Oct 4th without reading any reviews. I was just stunned by this masterpiece. Nobody prepared me for that. Movie of the decade. I watched it again just to make sure I am not exaggerating. Pure art in all categories. And No, Joaquin Phoenix doesn't need the Oscar organization to recognise his achievement. He is a legend officially! :)"
2697,Unbelievable performance by Phoenix! Such a good film.
2698,"Funny guy Todd Phillips of Hangover fame gives up comedy because of the ""woke"" culture and creates a masterpiece in the process. The movie works perfectly even w/o any knowledge of the Batman universe. Joachim Phoenix should have his Oscar guaranteed."
2699,Excellent actor feels very natural. no batman because this is a prequel to that series.
2700,"The Joker. Brilliant performance by Phoenix .... Discover the relationship this tortured man had with his mother, work colleagues and how society let him down. Must see."
2701,Phoenix's portrayal of the Joker is one in which you understand the character more and the reasonings as to why and how he acted like he does and became the person he is.He is the first actor to make you feel sympathy and feel genuinely sad for him.The performance is gripping throughout the whole film making you think 'what Is he going to do next' and you feel like you know what's going to happen but it's a surprise.In one moment you see the character in a full on rage and the next he is apologetic and shows sincere empathy.This is the most amazing performance from any actor I have ever seen.Absolutely amazing.
2702,This movie is so emotional I cried in the cinema. Actually it shaws reality of what happened to the children whose being abused. Amazing performance of Joaquin Phoenix!
2703,"JokerThe Joker is similar to the DC Joker character but is not a criminal genius.The movie was a great depiction of how a person who has been mistreated, lied to, and ignored, totally lacking access to human compassion, can snap.The acting is top notch, the plot follows the journey of a mind into madness. Not only that, but it makes a statement about the society we live in. There are some really good plot twists and thought-provoking moments here that will prompt self-inspection.It puts a spotlight on the importance of addressing mental health issues in modern times.I highly recommend seeing this movie, and not for the comic book tie-in, either. This movie stands on its own and didn't need the context of a comic book character to get it's message across."
2704,"Dark, compelling, and you will be hooked to witness a man's journey to his self destruction."
2705,"I'm literally impressed and extremely happy
Joker will be the beginning of a revolution in the world of cinema and comic book movies ( i hope ).
This movie is brilliant, thrilling, sad and a beautiful dark masterpiece.
A spectacular character study with an unbelivebale and outstanding performance from Joaquin Phoenix, this is by far the best performance in last
10 years, the way he laughs, his body language, his eyes, his facial expressions are all out of this world, Joaquin conveys all types of emotions in a sensational way.
The story is well paced and takes us step by step with arther and his fall from sanity to insanity each action and each detail matters and affects the coming events and makes us as audience understand to some degree the horrible actions that arther will do in the future.
This movie accuses us the society and puts the blame on us for the way we treat ourselves and how we create within us monsters.
The Joker that we get in the end is a moving representation of the corruption in our society and especially our media wich explains why there is a group of ""critcs"" that are demonizing
The movie and ignoring the art in it and the big message it carries.
Todd Philips you surprised me this is big jump in your career from comedy to such a perfected drama the shots, the close ups, the cinematography, the tone of the movie everything is really masterful and of course how can i forget Hildur guonadottir and her mesmerizing score that fits perfectly each scene and each transformations arther goes through, her soundtrack plays with our emotions and our nerves and makes us feel the darkness of this movie.
This Film is nearly perfect, hard to watch, tough and makes you think about a lot of things. The only thing that may be bugging for some is the heavy inspiration from Scorsese's movies especially taxi driver and the king of comedy, i don't consider this a bad thing each filmmaker must be ispired from other works but it's a little but obvious here even so it's not a problem for me and because of all the other good things that impressed me and touched my soul and the questions that this work of art made me ask i give it a 10/10."
2706,"I watched this movie twice and I'm also willing to watch it again. I loved it. Everything about this movie is perfect, Music, acting, etc."
2707,"First of all: There was always a mystery about, why Thomas Wayne and his wife were shot in a narrow street of Gotham This movie delivers a story behind the scenes of so many Batman movies/comics. It makes sense for a lot of reasons, but in some particular moments in the plot, it feels like they tried too hard to achieve that goal (no worries, no further explanations).Additonally, it is not a DC popcorn movie. Not at all. I can understand why a lot of people are upset about this movie. It is more a modern film noir, with great sound, setting and a sketch of a character, or let's say a study of mental illness. If you ever left a movie theatre with mixed feelings and you were some kind of excited to felt once in a while that way, this is your kind of thing.You won't get your usual Joker. You won't get a comic book adapted to cinema. You will get a extraordinary Joaquin Phoenix performance. He carries the movie in so many ways.Chapeau."
2708,"One of the best movies i had ever seen , so dramatic .... great performance by Joaquin, it was one man show , definitely an oscar winning"
2709,"I don't really want to be a guy to tell, please go and watch this. I believe just a certain number of cinema lovers would really appreciate this film. I have not seen such great movie in years. Please cinema come back to good-old-days!!"
2710,"The movie is just a lit...... from everything it takes.... from a mentally tortured man to an altered ego 'Joker'..If you want me to pay a billion dollars....to watch this movie.... I would watch it a thousand times.....
Just a freaking awesome movie... I am just speechless....
Just the way outside this cinema hall..
I am writing this review..
.. it's a damn godly movie...."
2711,"Joaquin Phoenix performance here is the best performance of the decade. He most certainly tly deserves an oscar for this. And then when you read some of the improv scenes such as the refrigerator scene or the dancing in the bathroom scene you realize even more how truly great he is in this film. 10 out of 10, my only issue with this film, and why I give it 10 instead of friggin 11 or 12 out of 10 lol, is it should have been a little longer and it should have had him as joker in full makeup doing bigger crimes. In short, they should have gone even bigger in scope with it. Heres hoping he makes a return ;)"
2712,When Heath ledger played the joker he memorized the audience with such a brilliant performance. Not in a million years could I imagine anyone could do it again. Enter Mr phenoix if there where ever to be a real world joker this would be it. The dramatic character change from Arthur fleck to joker is unbelievably twisted and dark basically the Jokers middle names. The portrayal of the joker in this film for me deservers a standing ovation.
2713,"As someone who's loved Batman (and the Joker, respectively) since I was a child, I think I was going to enjoy the film regardless of how it turned out. Despite the fact that I was so hyped, I still had low expectations. So when I got up after two hours in the auditorium, I was blown away by how fresh and riveting the film was. Joaquin Phoenix played the role perfectly, and the character and story was beautifully created by Todd Phillips. Some of the dialogue wasn't very memorable, but then I realised that not every line has to be. After all, this film was meant to be what could possibly happen in a real scenario, and not everything said in real life is poetic or memorable. So that being said, I really have no faults with this movie. It was everything I wanted and more."
2714,"The positive reviews clearly got the movie, the negative ones are stuck in the past. This movie is difficult to watch. It's a savage depiction of humanity. Must watch!"
2715,"I didn't intend to see this movie at all, because I thought what can a Batman movie bring anew, and I was surprised to read oldest cinema festival in the world gave it Best Picture award. It felt displaced.
Then I have seen the amazed reactions from viewers, saying it wasn't what they have expected, one was even (half seriously, half jokingly - hey, like Joker!) flirting with social uprising in his comments. (Joker says he's not political. He's just one of the lowest, being pushed one too often. The lowest masses can identify with that, so some audiences around the world joined in spontaneous applause. In less confident societies, such movies got banned.)So, I have decided to see it, and yes, it's not your usual blockbuster from the Batman franchise. Such a movie, with main character having mental issues, societal issues, family issues, relationships issues, sort of Turrets Syndrome issues as a nervous tick, younameit issues, would usually fit the Sundance or even more alternative, indie, heavy movies festivals, not receiving praises from mainstream audiences, having a 9something rating on IMDB and breaking the overall October opening record in domestic market. Youth is filling the cinemas to see it, although there's not one flashy gadget or usual CGI scene from the franchise. Have the times really changed and will newer generations demand a wholesame approach to all the disadvantaged (and the Earth)? Oscars buzz all over the place. Perfect songs to perfect scenes. The atmosphere and ambience of the movie is visually depressing, pressing down on a drowning, smiling hero. If you gotta go, go with a smile.. Modern society is convincing an individual, that success is in own hands, while individual and life are in fact a summary of ones experiences. Joker is a recognizable character, every loser trying not to be one, can identify with him..
When Joker says, he's got nothing left to loose, before loosing it, after he's been trying really hard to be a good and normal, contributing member of the society (even trying to have an intellectual career as a stand up comedian, although not realistic, yet also doing demeaning jobs like a rolling sign; not demeaning for a teenager/student job..), and whole movie convinces you it's society's fault he became the monster we know, you start thinking it's surprising all those homeless people don't start killing everyone. Maybe they still have more decency as a person, than society, that put them there. I can also understand the already expressed worries, movie might send some troubled mind on a shooting spree again.. Mistreated persons might go crazy. Because this world secretly prefers failures, that is common already from primary school class dynamics (if everyone around you is a failure, it makes you more of a success).
If the movie reflects worrying reality of the world, the problem is in reality, not the movie.."
2716,I never get swept up in the hype of films. But this film is worthy of it. An absolute masterpiece. Phoenix is magical in his performance. Seen it twice already!
2717,"This film was engaging from the very first moment to the very last. That is not to say every moment was a blockbuster high action event, but the acting, pacing, and staging of every scene was so dynamic and carefully crafted that one feels engaged at all times, regardless of energy level. Joaquin Pheonix is truly a master of acting, and his ability to completely transform into Arthur is astounding. The piece that truly sells his role as Joker are his eyes: he truly has a madness in his eyes and they pierce through the screen. This film does not seem to fit into any one genre (horror, action/adventure, comedy) but rather is more like a character study and artistic demonstration on the formation of Joker in Gotham City. This is a modern, self-aware, psychologically relevant perspective on a traditionally outlandish, wild, and inexplicably wild villain from DC cannon. This sets a new standard for DC films, and puts the previous flops to even greater shame."
2718,"This movie is the first thing dc has done right since Wonder Woman and Kind of Aquaman which might survive on their own story arcs, but they outdid bvs and justice league so much they were left with a tough decision, splitem or quitem, and im still inerested to see what they do. But this movie has alot to do with the abandonment for ""what one thinks is ones own good"", and how many people that live not such enriched lives feel towards those who take it for granted. Anyway to not keep this joker story arc at least involved in the new films may be a mistake. They can literally do anything they want with it. This is the original Joker, was not one before him in this movie, this guy could seemingly cause enough problems without any outside contact, but surely his escape will be inevitable. Only reason i gave nine stars is why a paternity test was never done to prove it, telling me theres a good chance he is his father and just or was a complete hypocrite that refused to confront his past."
2719,"One of the things I found most memorable was the transformation of Joaquin Phoenix---the story isn't about a comic book villain, but a real person with a serious illness. All during the movie we see how life is for him--a horror of humiliation and fear. He trudges thru life (to get to his seedy apartment, he has to climb steep cement stairs. ) In his transformation into 'Joker', we can feel his sense of triumph as he descends those same stairs---Joaquin is unrecognizable in this new identity. This movie has hit some kind of nerve. So far, no violent imitators, just big numbers at the box office. In NYC, those stairs have become a tourist attraction."
2720,"Joker Review iHamad Saif Al Reyami
Still after 3rd time watching Joker I do not know what stopped me from reviewing this Film? I will try my best to Review it! Although There are many Reviews and videos published for Joker but what I will say it will not be a spoiler .The story from the Joker perspective:
My name is Arthur, someone who is undesirable in this society. Even my lean body doesn't attract anyone! My mother is a sick person and I take care of her and she is the only person who I admire in my life.
I enjoy watching (Murray ) program on television, which adds to me some kind of tenderness which is lost in my life .
A new life starts for me and I get to know my feelings clearly and what I need gradually forming.
The rest of the events I will not tell you here and it is better to identify it by watching the film, and Hamad Saif Al Reyami will complete to explain my and everyone performance who worked in making my character.
Since the Joker film has become an important phenomenon in the world of cinema and entered the atmosphere of the Oscars there are so many opinions and gossips has been talked about the film, so let me first to talk about the negativities of this movie, yes there are many negativities from point of some called critics!Some said that Joker glorifying crimes and born more criminals in the so city. My answer is simply: Did (Godfather) which is considered one of the most beautiful works in cinema, trained criminals on how to shoot the gun and kill people by cold mind?
what about (Robert de Niro) character in (Taxi Driver) who have obsession with anti-society, where he became a criminal of nothing, did this character contributed to deployment a large number of terrorists, and this is also one of the glorified films in the cinema ?!
Therefore, the subject has nothing to do with artistic criticism. The conflict came from critics who may be professional in expressing their views on the political or economic issues of society. Some of them can conduct workshops and seminars on family relations. They didn't criticized Joker artistically! so this topic finished , some general public and viewers, who didn't like Joker were in small numbers and this is their right, but if we get to know each other closely, we will find most of them fans of (speed) or (super heroes) movies, I belive they were shocked by the Joker who is radically different from all the characters which been played in the series of ( Batman) and some of them come to the cinema hall just enjoy eating popcorn with a loud sound from their mouth , so how they can follow the film carefully! here I will start my critical review this movie.
What did Todd Philps done to make this film so special?
There are several important points exploited by Todd Philps the director of Joker which made me lay and magnetization my mind for two hours!
Todd used many technical skills I will mention some of them by my point of view :
The colors of the curtain in (Murry) show is similar to joker colors. A number of scenes, which contribute to the publication of special pictures and posters of the film in an elegant and mixed.
Every scene in the film looks like a picture from beautiful photograph album because the angles of the (Lawrence Cher), let us me capture now some scenes from the Joker you will find that you got an album from a professional photographs why those scenes looks so beautiful ? it is because of the colors and lighting and deliberate choices of places which fit to come out beautiful, such as graffiti or dyed characters in the window of the bus and make the streets wet and choose places that would copied in our mind like stairs and the metro stations, also he chose winter time for filming this movie to show all characters in thick clothes with multiple colors which match with the Joker mask.
Moreover, most scenes were filmed at night to add the atmosphere of the film Grief and melancholy.
Technical things can be handled easier than before and this may be a small percentage to make this film attractive, which was written by Todd and (Scott Silver) since 2017, joke character is completely different from previous films of ( Batman), so that is the challenge In writing the this kind of characterIn order to prove this thing, the writers of the film have drawn characters and scenes in depth as I mentioned about visuals work ,here you will see new things in the character of the Joker like his laughing styles . anger lough, laugh sarcastically at society
, a laugh of pain and sorrow, and of course laugh just for laughing.
Each of his lough has different tone and a different of sound and there is a sad smile full of grief that we didn't feel in previous Joker characters.
The character of the Joker was painted on paper as Lean body to show a special aesthetic across the screen and this makes viewers involuntarily motivated enthusiastically to encourage this Joker, especially when he has the feeling of freedom from restrictions.
A special dance scene was added to the Joker, which is also a deliberate addition to explain his psychological state.
Blending psychological things in the film such as laughter when joker is in tension this thing never been written before in any film! Mostly those kind of situation used to show criminals in this kind of laugh scenes just to show the fierce character! but here you are very sympathetic to the Joker and laughing because of mental illness, this The behavior made me to study this character, through which you can deduce many things from human behaviors, whether positive or negative and here I find negativity more which is often the dominant and this contributed a lot in the sympathy with the character we see across the screen.To support Joker story writers imagine this character in the beginning of the 80s were in which the revolution was fabricated in New York and of course in the film was based on the fictional city ( Gotham ) known in the Batman series ,some real events used here, Such as a commercial featuring Clint Eastwood in his age of 40s, as well as the title of a movie outside a cinema theater called (Zorro, The Gay Blade ) Which was released in 1981.
Soundtrack and music has been very appropriate in this film, when we talk about music and songs in Hollywood we recall romantic films like the legendary film (Titanic) with the famous song of (Celine Dion) or the music of the most famous gangsters film in the history (The Godfather) which carried special music
It stays as an echo in our ear And whenever you hear it anywhere, the godfather returns in your imaginationSo this dark film( Joker ) carried songs and music from Hildur Guðnadóttir, all songs are accurate and was great choices in which made perfectly for the situation like the song (It's Life) comes in a scene that represents the life of Joker who made a decision for himself.
In my opinion, the bath dance music will be remain as one of the best art in the Hollywood music because of the aesthetics of the scene which beautifully directed by balanced dance, this was one of the important scene in the film and of course the instrument which is used for this tune was effective its called (Haldorophone)
Hildor coordinated her melody and experience for years until she made this to the joker.The cast may have been less importance because of the the Joker character, but every character in the film present something important, Robert De Niro, who plays a comic television presenter which character remind us of the comic artist in the early 1980s (Robert Babkin). The fact that we did not get used to watching him in these roles, but from the 1st scene of him he enters with a musical welcoming which made me feel that he entered the mode of this character watch him in the climax scene with joker where he deliver great impact! Zizi Betz in the role of Sophie and her analogy with the formation of the fingers of her hands as a gun which is similar to the (taxi driver) character has a special role in the film, Francis Conroy as Arthur's mother does not have many dialogues but her impact is important in the conduct of the Joker life, Brett Cullen plays the role of Thomas Wayne Candidate for Gotham City is an important role in the formation of the Joker character.Joaquin Phoenix, will be known as Joker by many people even for who do not go to the cinema , he Calculates and estimates his role which was written on the paper, the control on his face, especially when he smile and laugh, and the style and the tone of his dialogue delivery is completely different from his previous films, I became watching him in two parts in the film, but you can recognize him by sound of laughing, His lean body is perfectly consistent with the character whether in the movement of walking or jogging as well as his face properly formed at the height of his cheeks up after the smile feel it is a perfect image of the character of the Joker which gives you the impression that no other actor can be suit to this role, honestly Joaquin made this role Immortalizing in the memory of Hollywood Although it is early to say that, but what Joaquin done is not seen for several years from any actors ! it will be so difficult for anyone to bag the best actor award this year from Joaquin ,will they need a miracle indeed for that!
Director Todd Philps has succeeded in giving us important lessons of feeling different cinema experience , the Paranormal world of DC comics has adapted the dramatic and human art very well , the question is whether DC will be continue to work on this ideas for other characters or it is just in case for the Joker?
The movie may be two hours long, but you will live with it for a long time. For those who refused Joker, They have to watch it again so that they will not lose the chance to savor this film which difficult to have in our time!
5 stars out of 5"
2721,"Me and my partner have just watched this at the cinema.....😱😱😱😱
This magnificent movie stirred up So many emotions that will stay with us for a long time. It swept us off our feet. It was a glorious feast for the eyes!. Had us hooked from the very beginning. In so many words which still won't be enough.... It was outstanding, superb, captivating, fascinating, hypnotizing, extraordinary, exceptional, majestic, opulent, entrancing, monumental, unique.... Wow wow wow..... also a deep sense of sadness and empathy that brought us both to tears as we walked out of the cinema... For us...a Masterpiece of a film!"
2722,"Joaquin Phoenix's interpretation come out swinging with several immediate punches to the gut almost making me shed a tear before the thirty minute mark. Joker is a strong story with incredible attention to detail, going as far to show Arthur Fleck (Joker) almost being more physically healthy with the Joker makeup on.
Joker presents a darker look at todays society and the stigmatization of the mentally ill and how they are ""subhuman"", to the point were the film blurs the lines of reality and fiction, several times demonstrating that Joker could have been helped but instead was ignored by an ignorant government and population.Joker is an incredible film that should be on all viewing lists and I would highly recommend for you to go see it"
2723,"The movie is like a window to an emotion, to a philosophy. They showed us how to look and perceive someone's actions by looking at their interactions. Joaquin Phoenix, I wish you the best. It seems that you internalized Joker so deeply, so made us believe you're noone but him. From now on, nbody can even dare to portray another Joker."
2724,"There is such a menagerie of emotions in this film. You feel bad for the Joker, yet disgusted by his actions. Jacquin is incredible bringing the weirdness of his akward character to life. His moves, his words, his emotions and his thoughts are all absorbed watching his on screen. This is award winning acting and writing."
2725,"Just by watching this movie you can tell that Joaquin Phoenix makes every effort possible to perfect his role as the iconic Joker. He makes the viewing experience incredibly uncomfortable but in all the best ways. The viewer truely feels that Joaquin is actually psychotic and mentally deranged. Viewers will compare him to Heath Ledger and Jack Nicholson's portrayal, but each Joker is beautiful in their own way; there is no comparison.10/10"
2726,Good movie. this says a lot about our society. that part where he killed Murray really got me. #relatable
2727,"I think a lot of reviewers and critics did not watch this movie to the end. For example, read Morgenstern's review at WSJ. The movie can only be understood if you stay fir the last scene. In the last scene Phoenix is in a mental hospital talking to a nurse. This movie is about mental illness. It has nothing to do with Batman. Phoenix is mentally ill. Throughout his life he was mis-treated, abused, made fun of, and abandoned by his family and society. He is delusional and his experience is reflected by the illusion of the Batman/Joker comic. The ""Joker"" is a delusion of this mentally ill person who was on meds and had them taken away. The movie is his fantasy of rebellion and revenge. I found this a very powerful and somewhat brilliant way of addressing mental illness. The reason why it is misunderstood is because it involves gun violence but does not condemn it. Morgenstern's review is a good example. The pc cause du jour is gun violence, not mental illness."
2728,I'm not a big fan of comics. But I am fan of everything around the pop culture that superheroes are. So I know a couple of things about Gotham and Batman.My hype for this movie was because it's proclaimed as very violent and talks about mental issues. I love characters with mental health problems so watching this was awesome. The Joker it's the first movie with a low pacing and obviously not commercial that I would say it's my favorite of all times.The third act of this movie it's golden. No spoilers but the ending left me shaking.
2729,"Well played, well shot but one wonders why the movie theater is packed with Teens and Twens obviously enjoying the film.
The plot stays within the usual boundaries: Villains have to have a condition to avoid that society (even the rich) is left with all the blame. I have seen worse films but I apart from some very intense camera work and acting, I left the movie with mixed feelings, mostly because I wonder what makes others rave about this story. With all the current anger and protests around the world, from the yellow jackets in France to the protesters in Hong Kong, Quito, Barcelona and Santiago de Chile one explanation might be that this plot about the origin of anger and aggression in a troubled looser who blames individuals, not the system, to be ignorant and deaf to his needs, apparently seems logical to a generation without other means to explain their personal anger."
2730,"This film draws you in from the very start and keeps hold of you right to the very end. You shouldn't feel sorry for him but you do, you just want people to be nice to him and for him to have a better life but then there wouldn't be any point to the film if that was the case. I'm not a Batman or super hero fan but you don't need to be to watch it. Whilst it obviously links to the super hero films, it's still a standalone film in its own right and a brilliant psychological crime drama. Never before have I seen a film that I'm still thinking about a week later."
2731,"The story telling is so brutal that it's almost poetic. I didn't watch the trailer and just thought it'd be a Batman-ish movie. I was grasped by the story telling from the very first shot. The settings, the music and the best part, performance, made me fully immersed in the story."
2732,"This was the first time that I witness an audience giving applause at the end of a movie in cinema. I can tell you it was totally worth it - every piece and every second of it. I was left haunted after the first screening, so I went for an another today and it was the same like the first, full of joy and excitement, seeing Arthur transforming into Joker.... Joaquin blew our mind, the audience was enjoying as if it were live screening. If his Majesty Mr. Phoenix doesn't win an Oscar, I can say and please allow me to quote Roberto Benigni from ""La tigre e la neve"" - they can close this whole show of a world... they can cart it off, unscrew the stars, roll up the sky and put it on a truck, they can turn off this sunlight..... Hats off!"
2733,"Phoenix is the best he's ever been. The best anyone's ever been. The score and soundtrack is fantastic. The cinematography is great. The writing is amazing. The set, costume and production design are incredible. The film is phenomenal and if it gets snubbed at the Oscars it is officially an unnecessary and completely commercial not at all critical film award ceremony."
2734,This movie makes you think. It is a commentary on our world.
2735,"It is weird, normally when I come to the cinema to watch DC movies, DC usually let me down recently. But Joker 2019 is different. Bear in mind, Im no movie critic or something, Im just trying to justify my review as a fan who finally get the movie he want.
Normally, for a villain character, movie makers fail to justify his ""evilness"". Because they tend to isolate the character with the world around them, thus general movies create theme of ""edginess"" that me and others despite the most. But Joker is not a character, if somebody ask me to describe who, what, how is Joker, it is extremely difficult for me to explain who he Joker. Joker is more like a presentation of the society around him (Gotham City). There is no ""right right"" in this kind of scenario. Any characters in the movie are flawed in their own way. Many of them like Thomas Wayne of ""the rich"" are evil in many standard, but they convince themselves and the society around them that they are ""all good"". But Athur (Joker) fight back that kind of attitude, he tried to seek help but all the help he receive just pushed him further into madness. In the end, he is nobody, Arthur gave up his identity the society gave him to be reborn as Joker.
I have to say, watching Joker is very uneasy experience, it is very disturbing to be honest. So watch with ur own regard. But this is what art is, to push border, to go above and beyond normal standard. This film is definately special."
2736,"To the people, who say Joaquin Phoneix deserves an Oscar for his performance, please pardon me, but I beg to differ. This guy does not deserve an Oscar, Oscar should beg in front of him and say ""Please accept me!"". He is a walking university of acting. Every scene, every private moment, every emotion, its beyond human perfection! This kind of cinema is a rare commodity. I could give million stars to how everything in this movie was picture perfect (from direction to music to acting to cinematography to screenplay). Please watch it in theaters. You will not be disappointed!"
2737,"Joker is not really a perfect movie as it has its moments of flaws but its the peformance of actors that you wont stop raving about. It is also very disturbing, haunting and scary at a times. As the movie is filled with violence and based on controversial topics where some people may have issues with the way it is presented. But keeping aside its flaws, the ensemble cast give great boost to the characters but the one man who rules above all is joaquin phoenix the face behind the joker. He potrays the character of joker in perfection giving it all blood , sweat and tears. It wont be of any surprise if his bags get filled with trophies for his career best peformance. It's rare to see such a brilliant peformance where one can hardly move an eye from him. The story and direction has its roller coaster moments, there are few scenes where the storyline seems a bit forced. The background music is fantastic as it completely fits with the flow of the scenes. The movie despite its flaws still stays among the favourite flim of the year clearly due to the actor joaquin phoenix for his iconic peformance . i rated 10/10 rating only for joaquin phoenix acting......"
2738,"Remember the two minutes in Japanese anime before the villain dies, he starts remembering the bad incidents and situations that led him to be evil.
This film is about that except instead of two minutes it's two hours.
It will make a good 1st episode in the 1st season in some TV series, so don't get your hopes high.
You will have to watch it anyway, otherwise you will miss Joaquin Phoenix amazing performance."
2739,"I think it will win oscars for bedt cinematography ,best screenplay,best actor in a leading role"
2740,"I would like to start off by saying that Joaquin Phoenix is a goddamn genius! His acting is out of this world and it truly brings together this beautiful movie. I seriously cannot think of one thing I didn't like about the movie and honestly I don't understand how people can possibly dislike it. First off, for people saying it's slow and boring, it's not meant to be a typical action packed superhero movie. If you went into the movie thinking that's what you were getting with this movie then you need to take a film education class. And if you don't see the amount of finesse and time was put into the movie then I don't know what to tell you. All in all, thank you Joaquin and Todd for creating such a beautiful historic movie! If this movie doesn't win at least 1 or 2 oscars on top of Joaquin alone then we will riot with clown masks."
2741,"I got home from watching this in theaters a few hours ago,. It is truly one of the greatest, spectacular, wonderful and most marvelous movies ever made. 10 out of 10!!!!!. From start to finish, I was completely hypnotized from this true cinematic wonder.original, outside of the box, risk taking and unpredictable. I love that with a capital L.Even though its not exactly true to the comics, but truly love how much the movie's originality was inspired by them.I put this on top of my list of my most favorite movies that stand out. Along with my favorite directors and favorite actresses (ariana grande and eiza Gonzalez) rare gems that truly stand out from the crowd.I'm a filmmaker myself and JOKER also inspired me to shoot with the Alexa 65 even much more now. (Someday soon)Great direction,
Cinematography,
Acting,
Look and feel the movie gives. Etc,etc.I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!"
2742,"I see a lot more great reviews for this now but when it first came I saw a lot of hate. I don't understand that at all, those people to me only wanted an action movie as they apparently didn't have the intelligence to understand a psychological thriller like this. As I stated, this wasn't trying to be an action movie, it wanted to show the Jokers transformation from harmless crazy guy down the street to full on psychotic criminal kingpin. I don't think this is really a major spoiler, but I loved how we were able to see young Bruce Wayne's story unfold in the background as well! I told my sister when we talked about a sequel that if she wanted to know what happens next, go straight to Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight, then you'll be able to watch two brilliant performances in a row as the Joker, (You were awesome, too, Bale, but this is about the Joker- lol). and basically see the whole story of his life in those two movies. But, that's not to say I'm not onboard with a Joker sequel! I think this is in the running, if not the front runner, for my best movie if the year, but I'll have to sit down and have a look at all the others I've seen! Awesome flick!"
2743,I like everything in the joker like his sadly laugh and his joker run and his body and his nervous
2744,"This movie isn't for all viewers who subscribe to mature audience material, especially viewers with acute depression and other mental disorders. Yet those who courageously go through the motions will find a high level of appreciation for the extreme psychologically graphic material delivered masterfully by an actor whose whole career is outshone by his performance in this movie alone.This being said, the iconic supervillain is finally seen coming to terms with his downhill path to unlock his true nature that defines the true nature of the Clown Prince of Crime, and the sordid story of his relationship to his mother.Much also provided with DeNiro's up top performance that greatly magnifies the intensity of one of the most shockingly memorable movie climax moment seen in years.Joaquin Phoenix outdid himself all around and outdid the hype masterfully."
2745,"Before I went and saw Joker in theatre's I was afraid that the movie would turn out a disaster but at the same time I was thinking we don't really need this movie, but when I walked out of the theater the first viewing I was extremely happy of how the movie turned out. Joaquin Phoenix's performance was fantastic he felt so real. I really liked how it was a origin story for joker but it still didn't tell you everything most things in the movie you will have to figure out yourself, I love when they do that in movies. The only little flaw I had in the movie is that it felt a little to much like the Taxi Driver, it kind of has the same plot and if you have seen that movie Joker could get a little predictable but that is really the only thing I have wrong with the movie. So yeah over all I absolutely loved this film and I recommend checking it out."
2746,Really good movie the best I've ever seen Joaquin Phoenix I cant wait to go again if he's not at least among the nominations for an Oscar it's an absolute travesty
2747,"A really well acted out movie and Joaquins performance was astonishing! The lines, expressions and acting in general felt so real."
2748,"Just watched the movie and it was wonderful. I just don't want to spoil things, but I would advice everybody to watch this masterpiece. The acting is top notch.I don't understand all the backlash from journalists. It's far from being an incel motivated movie. These reporters don't know what incel actually means. This movie has nothing to do with it.We all know who deserves an oscar!"
2749,"Saw the Joker last night....it was incredible.It was dark, sad, violent and thought provoking. For me, this is the best and most believable version of the Joker backstory to date, maybe not what the DC fandom expected, but his backstory has changed multiple times over the near EIGHTY years he's been in existence, it was a refreshing new direction that takes the viewer out of their comfort zone.Phoenix was the hero of the day, so into the character, that his body was just as warped as the mind of the man he was portraying. I've always rated him as an actor, so I'm not surprised by his chilling performance and the way he is able to pull you into the mind of a mad man.Let's not forget Todd Phillips, for a man who's better known for writing and directing comedy films, he too deserves a standing ovation for bravely steering the franchise down this shadowy alley. 😎"
2750,"If Joaquin phoenix did not win an Oscar, then i feel sorry for Oscar ."
2751,"Joker is an outstanding character study. One of 2019's biggest surprises, pushing the boundaries of what you're comfortable with looking at. Not once did it seem like I was watching a comic book movie. It's a chilling and artful approach to the iconic villain that doesn't hold back on exploring mental illness and the lower class in a brutally raw and honest way. Even with its occasional touches on the Batman mythos, which flowed well with the story and didn't seemed forced at all, the focus is entirely on Arthur Fleck's turmoil and transformation into the Joker and Joaquin Phoenix delivers a richly disturbing performance to support that. The psychological twists to some story cliches were unexpected and refreshing, too. Amazing film. Not for the faint of heart. I'll never listen to Frank Sinatra the same way again."
2752,"This is a landmark movie. Maybe one of the most important movies to be released in the last 10 years.
Not only is the film brilliantly made from how it looks and sounds, but it also has something to say it has balls.
I hope this film changes Hollywood perception on how not just comic book films are made but all films."
2753,This is the Joker i was waiting for! The acting the soundtrack everything just made a such a bit impression.
2754,"This picture gives real insight into the mind of the joker and really builds his story like never before...In doing that it really gives some raw insight into the issues revolving around mental health, and it does it very realistically not sparing the dark details.Joaquin Phoenix should most definitely be considered for a oscar due to his incredible performance as the JOKER."
2755,Walked out of the cinema with a smile on my face as wide and brash as The Jokers.This film has brought back Cinema. Best film I've ever seen in a theatre.Will be buying on Blu-Ray as soon as it's released for a second watch.
2756,You really feel this character. Anyone who has ever been picked on or feels the world is against them will relate more. The message should be clear on how some people don't realize how badly they treat others. We live in a world where sometimes people are so wrapped up in themselves they don't care about another human being's feelings. For me I found myself on the Joker's side. I felt pain for his pain. He has just been kicked down over and over again. He feels that life is just nasty and short and nobody cares?! The human race is bad. Joaquin Phoenix does an incredible job of conveying that vulnerability and rage. With the mood swings and crazy laugh it's hard to imagine that you want him to be the hero not a villain. In his mind he is the hero ridding the world of cruel people. There have been several very different portrayals of the Joker in other movies but by far Joaquin Phoenix is in a class of his own. A dark character that you feel sympathy and empathy for. He's aware a monster is evolving inside of him and he struggles with it before releasing it. Overall this is a solid movie with a lot of darkness and depth and Joaquin Phoenix definitely deserves an award for the best performance I have seen in a very long time.
2757,"The Story, twists, acting and the love of Detail for the Dc Universe (story of Gohtham) is great and the movie tryed something completly new, a new interpretation of the Joker in Gohtham. The acting of Joaquin Pheonix is breathtaking 'oscar' ... and i love the style the Martin Scorsese style.
The music is great and it fits perfectly with the Joker, compared it makes the movie really oppressive and breathtaking.""Its a great movie with an great actor who made the film a real masterpiece. Rotate,
camera and music were great to and overall the movie is just oppressive and the audience has no clue how to handle this person. Morally its really hard to handle the movie, misdeeds and the transformation of the Joker you got no clue how to handle the behavior of the Joker and thats makes the movie so good""Actully 10/10 i wish i could give 9.5.
Reason, at some points the movie was not subtle enough, just my opinion so i cant gave this a 10/10 but its really close to it.Ps: Sorry for my bad english, i tryed my best and i used a lot of Google. I hope you understood everything and i could help you. ;>}"
2758,"Lets just not talk about acting, making, bgm and all, because I know its a pure art, masterpiece. but this is something about reality, existence. when you realise everything around you is full of lies, awful, careless, just living in someone's story, being some human 'thing'. Then you feel you are not exist. if really want to exist, you have to become unknown that is 'Joker'"
2759,"Just got back from seeing it 4 hours ago and it was as great as I thought it was gonna be, Joaquin Phoenix's performance is fantastic (everyone else is great too but Joaquin commands the entire thing), the score and soundtrack were fantastic, the opening credits fit perfectly with the theme, and even the cinematography is great (this was a grimier, dirtier, and uglier Gotham City than what we're used to). it can easily pass as a scorsese flick since his fingerprints were left after leaving the producer's chair. I'm torn between which joker I like best between ledger and Phoenix, but I know that heath ledger would be very proud of Joaquin for pulling it off, give him ALL the oscars I say, he's earned them. but anyway, I recommend this to scorsese fans and joker fans alike. I definitely wanna see it again, maybe even buy the blu-ray. on a side note, for it being a slow burn, it's actually a slow burn done right like The Godfather"
2760,"This is worth the wait. If the academy does not appreciate this, then they should just give an oscar to whoever they get drunk and play name the worst movie of the year. This is worth it. The time invested to see this makes you wonder, am I that person? The mask or the person looking at the man in the mask. This movie should make all wonder this."
2761,All I can say is WOW. Just an all around amazing movie. Finally a movie not all about action (which i love too). Gotta keep paying attention. Just a beautiful masterpiece of acting.
2762,"The uniqueness of this movie can't be underlined enough. As you can definitely relate it the likes of Taxi Driver, this film stands alone in its production, direction, photography, score etc. Albeit, it can be disturbing to some at times, it sheds light on very common issues in today's society including corruption, mental illness, etc. It took me days to conjure an opinion on this movie after seeing it, making it even more unique to myself. My final opinion being it's a remarkable piece of art."
2763,This is amazing... Nothing's ever black or white. A shade of grey is what this movie is about. Nothing but the best movie that's come out in a while. Its not a superhero or supervillain movie. Acting and the pain were completely believable.
2764,"Where do I begin, I didn't think anyone was able to make a movie like this after Dark Knight. The emotions I experienced in this movie, I don't think I have felt like this in a movie theater in a long time. The acting, direction, cinematography & music all deserve awards. Joaquin Phoenix is by far the best actor working today. His transition from normal man into Joker was chillingly convincing. Makes all marvel movies look cartoonish and kids play. This is masterful movie making, with top notch acting. A must watch!!"
2765,It blew me and my wife away. I was skeptical at first but wow unbelievable film. Definitely a must see. If Joaquin doesn't get a Oscar for this then the Oscars are rigged. I couldn't believe how I was on edge of my seat the entire film. Me and the wife will be going next weekend to see it again.
2766,That was a best movie..acting was awesome..i like it..so nice...i think this movie can get oscar
2767,"Having watched Hollywood decline alongside with the latest trend of the dumbing down of nations (as I call this phase we are in), has made going to the cinema more of an empty distraction than a meaningful experience for the past number of years. Thus, when I sat down to watch this movie my expectations were low, as usual. It turned out that this movie was one of the best movies I have ever watched on screen.There is never going to be a Joker movie that can surpass this one - this was pure art scripted and performed by real talent. Joaquim Phoenix is also a real actor, unlike your usual dumb as hell, painfully overrated cadre of overpaid Hollywood pretty boys - who can't act.10."
2768,"It's a complete movie, story telling wise, Acting and cinematography and music and every little detail"
2769,"The movie is dark, it's gritty and intense at times. Its a movie that gets the discussion going on so many questions that we ask within society today. Todd Phillips has done such a sublime job he not only handled the entire movie with care and attention to detail but he raised topics that are still being spoken and debated about today. Joaquin was perfection, DONT go into this thinking it's going to be the in the same realm as Heath Ledgers Joker it's so different. Almost like two different genres.Overall this is the best movie I've seen 2019, I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. It's slower burner of a movie and the pay off is brilliant.10/10.This is a fantastic route for DC to follow. Stay on this path."
2770,"I had mixed feelings after watching the trailer. I said to myself that this won't be a good movie, no effects, no fast-paced action, no Batman, no classical Joker.Actually you don't need any of these in order to make a great movie. Joker is brutally realistic and atmospheric. It makes you feel thorned, in some moments you like and emphatise the main character, in others you hate him. We witness the development of a character and the birth of the Joker in a very realistic way. We miss such movies nowadays with good story telling, great atmosphere and almost to no CGI. I just loved it, this is what cinema should be every now and then."
2771,"Insane movie, great acting, great plot and character development. And also a great insight in the forming of the Joker and the Batman."
2772,First time writing a review! What can I say absolutely amazing! It makes you feel sorry for him but then it just gets crazy. Amazing literally amazing. I forgot I was watching something from a comic. Outstanding.
2773,"Only Joaquin can do such an amazing job and give this character what it deserves, great music. and great acting. totally worth an Oscar.."
2774,"I went into this movie skeptical in terms of the hype around it. Now I understand it and I believe it deserves every part of it. The acting was, without exaggerating , the best I've ever seen from a male protagonist. As a literature enthusiast, the plot gave me the same feeling of watching a true literary classic unfold. Artistically, the construction of the scenes was immaculate, with the television reflecting the protagonist's psychological state and the recurring motifs of laughter and media used in the brightest of ways. The political commentary was not only well constructed but also incredibly relevant in our times. If you haven't watched Joker yet, stop whatever you're doing and run to the theater, this one is going down in history!"
2775,Perhaps the best movie of this decade. A must watch.
2776,"Makes you think how everyone can become such ""Joker"" if pushed by life hard enough.."
2777,"I like how Joaquin walks and dances on that stairs after all his been through. Ive been holding on my chairs on what will happen next. Its like im with the character all through out the movie. This is really good movie.
Actually i felt better after watching this movie. Been with a breakup recently and trying to move on and i dont know but actually this movie really helps me to move on. I listen to the songs used in this movie while going to work and i felt better. I could not thank enough how this movie save my life. I feel like im always happy everyday especially when i listen to ""That's Life by Frank Sinatra."" I imagine Joker and how he survive all those difficult times. Joaquin, Joker, i cant thank u enough. Thank u so much. You save my life."
2778,"Absolutely brilliant! I loved it. Fleck's slow descent into insanity was beautifully tortuous. The brutality of society and the harsh realism of big corporations are the advocates and cause of his demise. The music throughout was atmospheric, haunting, and at times utterly surreal. Joaquin Phoenix deserves an oscar for his performance and portrayal. He clearly put so much effort into the role as can be seen from his characters physical appearance. The movie was fantastically gritty, dark and poignant, It brings new meaning to the term, ""That's Life!"""
2779,"Joker is what I call a masterpiece, the film was phenomenal, brilliant,etc. I saw the film x2 and i was the best film I have ever seen. People say Avengers Endgame, is the best films of this year..... ROTFLMFAO. Joker is the best movie of 2019. As for Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck/Joker, what can I say he deserves an Oscar for this performance, I can not stop praising how good he was, I felt every pain and laugh he went through, the film was just great. Ceaser Romero and Heath Ledger would be proud of this guy. Joaquin Phoenix is the guy who would put his acting skills first then the money. He was dedicated to play the Joker and he absolutely nailed it. Todd Phillips is now one of my favorite directors now, along with Matt Reeves, Steven Spielberg, and Chris Nolan. I saw two times and I plan to see it again. Because, movies like these deserve 2 billion dollars in the box office, NOT ENDGAME. 10/10. The best movie of 2019 in my honest opinion."
2780,"We just went to Gold Class theatre tonight; in no small part due to the amazing reviews we read about Joker... we were not disappointed. It was incredible.
I am a big fan of the Batman Begins series, but this is not that. It is a character study, deeply disturbing, emotional and riveting... we were both spellbound.
There is no action, but we were on the edge of our seats none the less. It is an Oscar winning performance for Joaquin Phoenix or the Oscars are a joke. The whole movie is him, and he's incredible. I cried, I gasped, I laughed, I sympathised when the worst happened. I have always adored Chris Nolan's Batman, but this made me pity the joker.
I enjoyed the Avengers movies. But if that's what you want, move on. This is acting and character development at its highest form. If you don't appreciate acting and English at its highest level, it's not for you.
Bravissimo Joaquin, this was a lifetime's performance.
10/10 truth be told."
2781,"Amazing movie, awesome acting very well scripted with some superb background score. Keep all the negativity aside, movie a must watch, loved each and every scene."
2782,This is a masterpiece Oscar worthy... have no words Phoenix is a legend period
2783,"***REALITY IN A MOVIE***
This movie was written produced and played so well beyond words that can be spoken! The fact is this movie is just like society now people have no care or manners anymore. Everyone is so selfish and busy with themselves they only look out for themselves. People are given a bad hand and end up with issues that do need attention and help and our government spends more time on other things than actually helping our people in our nation! And we wonder why things happen tragedies happen then it gets attention why does it take that! This movie is an eye opener!"
2784,"This movie is like reading a book. Every scene has details of a psycopath's complicated emotions that are naturally perceived differently from one person to the other. This is exactly why it is a unique experience just like reading a book. This movie is not entertaining and it wasn't made to entertain people. I believe it was made for people to watch and think about it and live with it's emotions for a while. It is an unequal experience for different viewers. Those who see it as a marvel have understood why the movie was made in the first place and the messages drawn from it. Those not, have definitely missed the whole point. It is not a comic book movie for sure and the viewer needs to understand this before watching it."
2785,"After watching the trailer few months back, i had pretty high expectations.
I waited for so long to watch this film and i must say it didn't disappoint.
This one will definitely go down in cinematic history as one of the greatest movies of all time"
2786,Joker is a movie with few flaws. Phoenix performance is absolutely terifing and sympathetic at the same time. Throughout the movie you hear Arthur's haunting laugh the laugh is almost identical to mark hamils iconic cackle. The score elevates all of the situations with lots of tension. All in all joker is a fantastic film with best actor potential
2787,The best movie of the year by far and one of the best in years. The Phoenix interpretation is incredible. A movie repository for cinema....
2788,"I was pretty sure I was gonna like it but this film left me walking out the cinema speechless. The finest piece of work from Phoenix and Phillips.I have never rated or reviewed before, so this is my first one because I need to express my judgment for this movie simply because of the movie it ended up to be after anticipating since the start of production. This kind of acting and directing is exactly what I love and I consider to be my favourite being the huge film fanatic I am so I want to give all movies the right rating according to how I find them, so I would never usually give a movie a 10 because for me it has to be if not faultless but I am going to give this movie a 10 and to me here's why. I have always been a fan of Todd Phillips since his early goofy comedies to his later movies where I can tell he has set up a nice distinct directing technique and that is what I love about directors and the different styles they all have and use to put a film together, to then see what they bring to screen, but the way he has emphasised this film is truly remarkable. I didn't expect he would create and present a pure masterpiece but that is exactly what it is.
I have always loved Heath Ledger's portrayal of Joker, it was extremely stupendous, One of the best acting roles we have ever seen in film history, you couldn't disagree. But what Joaquin Phoenix had innovated was so unique and astounding, it was exactly what I look for in playing a psychotic character. I was honestly blown away with his performance. I am going to be extremely disappointed and confused if these two men don't receive an Oscar for best writing/directing and an Oscar for best actor. I feel like I shouldn't even have to mention the fact that it was fairly especial and absolutely nothing like a film you would think is DC, to me it's not a superhero/villain comic book character movie. It is the best character study flick I have ever seen. I know it won't be for everyone considering the few scenes of strong voilence and language and could be disturbing to some so I understand peoples different opinions on how they find the film but I found it to be precisely a literal showpiece with extraordinary qualities.
Please see it to find out."
2789,"One of the best films specially for a villain, Joker has reinvented the idea of the laughing clown and just gave a logic background for legder's Joker."
2790,"The director make the every lens abnormally delicate to draw the joker in exquisite,and let audience go deep into the joker's ""CRAZE"" mind.Although the delicate lens lead to the plot slow forward, but it also let us know that ""How did the society making human's mind fall apart"".Last but not least,one of the prop ,joker mask,I think the director layout the other people wearing the mask is mean they use the joker mask to reasonable their behavior.The opposite of the protagonist make up his face from outside(face) to inside (tongue),it means not only just the surface ,but also the spiritual become the joker."
2791,"People complaining about the violence, gore and disturbing scenes in this movie seem to forget the nature of the world we live in. The movie is about us, the world embodied in a character, losing its grip to reality and being irrational alltogheter in an artsy way. Beautiful picture, beautiful acting, everything's beautiful. The world's distruction is indeed beautiful. Watch the movie, draw your conclusions and go change the world while you still can."
2792,"I purposefully didn't read other reviews, as I wanted my opinion of this film to be my own. Did I enjoy it, possibly not. It wasn't entertaining or entertainment. What it was à dark, very dark and deeply disturbing reflection of our dysfunctional society. A society where the most vulnerable in society are marginalised and don't get the help or support they need.
This is a film about mental health and seeing it on Mental Health Awareness day provided a more powerful message than all the items on the news, in the press and on social media.
Joaquin Phoenix in the title role was beyond description in the way he bought this character to life. Chilling, frightening and yet at the same time conveying the vulnerability of a man lost in his own world, where there is no one to support him and no one who will listen to him and understand him.
Don't expect to come out of this film feeling good about yourself, but don't be surprised if you find yourself asking questions about the world we live in."
2793,"10/10 100/100 1000/1000 its a masterpice
excelent perfomance, great music.
Phoenix was legendary. I can say that its than good or also better Joker than Ledger"
2794,"Simply put, they took the most evil character in comic book history and made him not only relatable, but sympathetic. Joaquin Phoenix is riveting. I couldn't look away from the screen. This is a movie that sticks with you long after it is over. A brilliant social commentary as well about society's indifference towards mental illness and it's ineptness in dealing with the mentally unstable. By this point, I'm sure you've heard so much about this movie already. Just do me, yourself, and the cinema fan inside you a huge favor and go see it as soon as humanly possible. Thank me later."
2795,The movie the world needed.. with all the mental health issues and way society treats people today. This movie needed to happen
2796,"This was the best movie answering issues associated with mental illness. This is also how you start a franchise for super villains and super hero's. Joker could not have been better. Fantastic directing, amazing performance by Phoenix and great screenwriting. If America continues the road to self destruction then this could play out by a sociopath or psychopath who just gives in to the mind battles. Perfect movie."
2797,"This is one of the greatest movies I've seen in the last 5 years. The music, cinematography, acting everything was magnificent!!"
2798,"To Care or Not to Care....That Is the Question I put forth as the Theme of this film. To spoil my answer without you having to read the whole thing.....It's a bit of both.The Violence is the Crux of the FilmArthur, or Joker maybe at this point, commits different acts of violence through out the film. The first one is on a subway train where he his jumped by three men. Many want to point out whether these guys are rich and that they are white, etc... I rather keep this about the act that is committed to strengthen my opinion that this first act of of violence Joker does is totally self defense. Many people have suffered death taking feet to the body and head, let alone three pairs of them. Now, you might question how he followed and gunned down that third individual after the fact he ran away. I would only argue that in his heightened state of survival, the fight isn't over until you've eliminated the enemy. Many soldiers who have experienced war will tell you this. It may not be normal in regular circumstance, but in the middle of battle, its just how you think.So that is my verdict. On the train, he isn't a murderer. He isn't a monster. He is just a person defending his life. Now, that said, I still think this event let Joker get a taste of something that he eventually takes him to places that I don't agree with. This is what is so great about this film. Its a slow turning. Something that's hard to look at in society when most people are trying to live there lives in whatever degree. Whether they are happy, sad, mad, and everything in between.So use this film to discuss these acts. It will hopefully carry over into society in a positive way.Now the Next act of violence......This one is too me the one that really hits home. You see this guy break in the worst way. A man who was very alone, and yet the one person in his life, his mother, did not belong to him and vise versa. He murdered this woman. A woman who provided for him while still dealing with her own mental health. This shows you how disconnected Arthur had become. He felt totally victimized. This bothers me in two ways. One I wish I knew how to help. And Two, It also makes me feel righteous anger at him for not realizing he wasn't as bad off as he thought.I don't need to be angry with his act, because Justice is best delivered without passion. My passion is put towards the loss of lives that he took and the loss of Arthur Fleck himself. Its a Losing situation of a film, and so it challenges you too think of how to win. You win by examining life a little more. You don't owe anyone anything in this world, but a little reflection when watching films like these isn't going to kill anyone.....pun Indented.Well its off from there......That Apartment scene.....well I don't need to try to describe it.....it is what it is. The Joker is solving his problems in full comic book villain mode. (Right or Wrong, Joker always feel free, so enjoy it, its a movie.)Finally he point blank, in true Joker fashion, shoots Murray Franklin in the face on live television.So there it is. A man trying to solve his problems through violence. It had to have made him feel better. And so I ask whether you agree with this Joker or not, maybe now you can understand the why. And if you can understand that, then maybe this film has done what it set out to do."
2799,Wouldn't change a thing about it except i wish it was an hour longer. The camera angles and character development was astounding. Pleasantly surprised all of my expectations.I want a sequel that deals with arkam asylum and more villains like underutilized poison ivy and more. But as far as the story line with batman... this movie could end and then say 15 years later and start playing the dark knight and would make total sense.
2800,"The movie it's a masterpiece!
And mind blowing!
. incredible"
2801,"Joker might not be a movie that everyone likes, but if you focus hard enough, you'll realize this movie is an absolute masterpiece. You'll wonder for days to come what actually happened in this movie, and that's what makes it so worth while. Joaquin Phoenix makes you so uncomfortable in this movie with his acting, that's how good he is.Two quick warnings: Please don't take your children to this movie and please, if you have any mental illness or know someone with a mental illness, this movie will not be best idea to watch."
2802,Can't remember the last time I left a cinema feeling this way
2803,"Joaquin nailed it with his beyond the extra mile acting. He showed that he truly understands the character of Arthur Fleck, his sufferings, conditions, psychological issues, etc. He really shelled out this character. Performing a pathological laughter while crying seems to be an incredibly hard task to act out but yet he nailed it perfectly.He changed my view on the fact that I should be wary of people who seems different from us and should acknowledge that they may or may not have a psychological/mental condition.I gave 9/10 because the movie was quite slow but I understand that this was necessary to give us the audience a realistic transformation from Arthur to the Joker we know for at least the last 60 years.This film beats most movies I've seen mainly because of the quality acting given by Phoenix."
2804,"Best film in this century. Amazing. Over 10 months ago when I saw the teaser I was like ""Eh another dumb movie"" well let me tell you all something I was incredibly ""wrong"". This movie makes you understand everything makes you feel Joaquin it makes you feel emotion. It was superb and the acting felt so real. If this doesent get a Oscar I don't know what does"
2805,"Amazing ! But be carefull , there is side eeffects ! Best movie i watched ever at cinema!"
2806,The acting and the atmosphere is simply phenomenal. It's been ages I haven't seen a movie that bloody good!
2807,"He's a genius.
The movie is too sad to be true. Loved it!"
2808,"There are very few movies that leave an impact on you hours or probably even days after leaving the movie theatre. Joker is surely one of them and on the top shelf. The character portrayal is so strong and acting is so natural and deep that one cannot just let it out of one's mind. I was not sure whether to get sad or excited, depressed or ecstatic, serious or laugh. Its just a flury of emotions running through you and keep you glued to screen. Cinematography is awesome by choosing the right mix of colors and shots in a recession hit Gotham city. Music keeps you on the edge of the seat and there wont be enough words to describe the acting of Phoenix which is once in a lifetime performance."
2809,"When you see this movie , you live in it as joker ."
2810,"You know those moments that leave you so stunned that you realize what you've just witnessed is a once in a lifetime experience? That's what I got with Joker. This film literally had me experiencing all types of emotions, I was on edge the entire time. I felt pity, I felt anger, I felt anxious, I felt second hand embarrassment And I felt fear. this film was an emotional rollercoaster to say the least.The casting was incredible. I honestly thought that no one else could play the Joker as well as Heath Ledger, but Joaquin brought Joker from comic book villain to Human Antihero. Absolutely incredible."
2811,"Joker movie was just amazing 😲
It has a great script full of twists & turns 🌀
Awesome cinematography 📹
No doubt we all r missing legend Heath Ledger
But i must say Joaquin Phoenix was also exceptionally well as Joker
He has done a great role as #ArthurFleck
His laughter was just too good
He definitely deserves the ACADEMY (OSCAR) 🏆
And the tribute he gave to HEATH LEDGER won our hearts ❤ (If anyone of u noticed)"
2812,A huge respect to joaqin phoenix by the acting and all the crew making this movie
2813,He has to win an oscar. He just has to. If he doesn't win then oscars are unfortunately unreliable
2814,"Asserting as a one-off enterprise from DC universe and starting the original story of Arthur Fleck aka. The Joker (Phoenix) in 1981, director Todd Phillips (hailed from the THE HANGOVER trilogy fame), first thing first, has done a mind-blowing job in exbibiting a tangible retro flair from the film's imposing set design, a refuse-ridden, duck egg blue-hued Gothom City where anarchy is brewing at every sleazy corner, in tandem with Hildur Guðnadóttir's forboding symphonic score, it set the film's overall unforgiving keynote up to the eleven. And JOKER's closest kindred spirit might rightly be Martin Scorsese's seminal work TAXI DRIVER (1976), with a knowing nod to THE KING OF COMEDY (1982), not least hinted by Robert De Niro's presence here, and it palpably belongs to the veritable ""true cinema"" which Scorsese laments in his recent comments about DC's rival, Marvel's superhero movies.It is somewhat disconcerting (but not entirely unexpected) to learn Phillips' Venice Golden Lion winner is met with polarized reactions among critics stateside albeit being a legitimate box office leviathan by breaking all the October records in its opening week and audience simply adores it. Quite accountable, Phillips and his co-writer Scott Silver's script pluckily touches a raw nerve by lending an uncompromising view on the societal genesis of Arthur's violent predisposition - sowed by the disenfranchisement and impoverishment stonewalled by the plutocratic ruling class, represented by the future Batman's father Thomas Wayne (Cullen) and incited by the anomie and apathy Arthur faces on a daily basis....
continue reading my review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks"
2815,I went into this movie knowing it was going to blow me away but that was an understatement when I came out! Absolutely incredible acting from the great Joaquin Phoenix and supporting actors as well. Not to mention the cinematography was absolutely beautiful! Congratulations to Todd Philips on making a 21st century masterpiece.
2816,"It a epic movie, everyone should watch this movie.
Best acting by Joaquin Rafael Phoenix"
2817,"This movie was without a doubt, the best piece of cinema i have seen in quite a while. Intelligently written, masterfully acted and delicious to look at."
2818,"My feelings is very very good
I don't have feelings lonely now
This film make me sure I'm not alone
I'm a clown too"
2819,"Best Movie Ever
I

THIS

OSCAR

COMING
IF YOU LOVE JOKER
THIS MOVIE
IS
AMAZING"
2820,This one of the best movies I have ever seen. See it and relish it. And sack the critics.
2821,Wow did this movie live up to the hype! I loved every secomd.. I get that some people might not get it.. but Todd Phillips has created something beautiful here.
2822,"Due to the hype this movie was going to be either a huge pile of crap, or totally awesome, and for once the hype delivers.Its going to be a very polarizing movie, you're going to love it or hate it, its not a super hero movie, so if thats what you're after then you're SOL.If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get the oscar then there is no justice in the world.I totally understand why some people are giving it 1 out of 10 and why most are giving it 10, it really doesn't fit in any predefined boxBy far the best DC movie ever."
2823,"This movie leaves you with a heavy heart, while in awe of the artistic performance by both actor and director. Brings awareness and high levels of relevance to today's society!!!! Need more films to bring up important topics like this. 10/10. May directors in the future follow the example of Todd Phillips."
2824,"What an epic movie! Incredible performance by Joaquin Phoenix. His face and sorrow will remain with you for long long time. No doubts on Joaquin winning this years Oscars for 'The Best Actor'.
Movie is very dark and very depressing, but leaves a lasting impression. This movie may not be everybody's cup of tea, recommended only for strong hearted.
Excellent direction by Todd Phillips will completely engross you in that era effortlessly. A must watch...!!!"
2825,"The best best joker movie ever
WOW and the Saddest"
2826,You just can't let your eyes rid off from Arthur's character. The way the whole performance he has delivered is just masterpiece.
2827,"Best original store , the conversion between Arthur and joker now make a lot more since now , he's a crazy dude but he have hes reason ."
2828,"Well, I really don't know where to start, as Todd Phillips has clearly stated this movie has been inspired in the Batman comic books, but IT IS NOT, based directly in any comic o graphic novel ever published,Having said that, I consider this movie a masterpiece in every possible way. Undoubtedly one of the 10 best movies of this century, and also , without a doubt , one of the 100 best movies ever made in the history of cinema. Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely incredible in his representation of the mentally ill Arthur Fleck, and as the Joker is, well, absolutely out of this world. The Oscar to best actor should not even enter the competition this year, it belongs to him. A stark portrait of the cruelty of modern society, a superb reminder that mental illness is real and affects thousands of people around the world. What more can be said? Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix, and the rest of the crew and cast deserve a standing ovation. BRAVO !!!!!!!!!!"
2829,"First of all as you may have heard before, Joaquin Phoenix's performance is amazing. I don't really know how to explain it but throughout the movie I was totally convinced that this guys is really going crazy and his actions and facial expressions completely support that.
Second of all I find that the main criticism this movie gets is sympathizing antisocial extremists. Did joker just disappear after the Dark Knight? Like did they seriously forget that he is meant to be one of the most vicious and disturbing characters in comic books? After the killing joke the Joker's tone has been pretty set. It's meant to be an origin story for a VILLAIN not a hero. Now onto why the movie itself does not try to justify joker's actions, rather it wants us to help people like him. I think the main analysis came out in Joker's debate with Murray, he said something like(can't remember the exact wording) ""this is what happens to underprivileged and disenfranchised people when you have a cruel society, uncivilized people and a system that doesn't work!"" I think he was saying this not only to Murray, audience of the talk show or to the people of Gotham. He was saying it to us. The movie is telling us to take joker as an extreme example and be kind and thoughtful to everyone around you. To the people who live high above, come down and see how hard it is for them to simply put food on the table instead of just showing a blind eye like Thomas Wayne (disregarding the debate on whether joker is his son or not). The movie was also incredibly well-paced. The character development although I think didn't go its full potential, I was very satisfied. It also ties all its loose ends and explains really well how joker and what he symbolizes came together, as well as the birth of batman and their rivalry. Definitely my favorite movie of this year yet."
2830,"I'm still trying to digest what I've just seen, it was absolutely incredible, forget the fact that it was the joker - Joaquin Pheonix's interpretation of arthur fleck was unlike anything I have seen before. It will be character studied and debated for years to come. Absolutely incredible"
2831,"I'd have given it an 8 or 9. But decided on 10/10 to counter those teenagers giving unfair lowv ratings because they got ""bored"" and have no idea what they've just seen.Critics paid by recognized publishers also seem to degrade this piece of art. Hollywood politics in full flow.For those falling for inevitable comparison of Phoenix and Ledger, get this: Phoenix is the best Arthur Fleck (origin of Joker) for Ledger's the Joker. They complete each other.This isn't about the shrewd and brutal agent of chaos going about his business. This is about making of that epic character.A few things left open for interpretation (Thomas Wayne's note on the backside of an old photo being the biggest one) makes it even better.Phoenix has his name written on the Oscar."
2832,"Those who say nothing in this world is prefect, show them this movie."
2833,"It's rare when we get to see a movie that's this close to perfect. Normally something or another, sometimes multiple things, are lacking in a movie. It could be one of the actors, the writing, the cinematography could be subpar, and on and on. To have a movie made like that this is so nearly flawless across the board is very special.Joaquin Phoenix plays, quite likely, his best performance to date which says a lot considering how many great roles he's already done in his life. When I first heard about this movie when it was in the works I'll admit that I thought Joaquin was miscast. Boy was I wrong and in retrospect I'm not sure why I thought that.Another thing that concerned me initially was that the director, Todd Phillips, was unproven as anything other than a comedy director (to me). Another major miss on my part there. Todd Phillips did an absolutely amazing job both directing and writing this masterpiece of a movie.Going back to what I said above, most movies suffer from scenes that are either wasteful, serving no purpose or scenes that are flawed. All of these scenes serve a purpose and succeed at it very well by adding to the movie in some way or elevating the movie in some way. Further, there were some scenes that if they weren't in the movie the movie as a whole would have been less cohesive. Todd Phillips did such an amazing job walking the fine line between having redundant scenes or scenes that barely told us enough to paint the picture of how The Joker became The Joker.Truly an amazing movie. I'd rate it between a 9.5 and a perfect 10."
2834,Got to see a great joker after the legendary heath ledgers portrayal of the character in the dark Knight series. Hands down the best movie to have ever come out in 2019.
2835,"I saw tons of reviews leaving 10 stars and saying ""so excited to watch this"" and others leaving 1 star to ""counterbalance""I really enjoyed it despite all that, the movie was thrilling engaging and generally so entertaining! I wouldn't go in expecting an action movie though, it's not marvel. Get yourself ready for something closer to a character study."
2836,One of the best movies in ages and Phoenix is just exceptional
2837,This might be one of the greatest movies ever created. Ive watched the movie twice already and it is really jawdropping. Media just hates on this movie but don't mind it. And When you watch the film dont compare it to the dark knight or any other joker movie. This is a Drama movie not an action movie. So get yourself hyped up and se hos the joker was created. Heath Ledger would be so proud. Joaquin Phoenix did an amazing Job. Incredible acting really.
2838,... of Oscars! What an incredible achievement. Felt so uncomfortable all the way through - in the best ways possible.
2839,I'm very fussy with the movies I like or enjoy. This was fantastic and one of the best movies I've enjoyed in a long long time! Recommended x
2840,"Ad Astra 2hrs of total boredom,Joker grips you from the first minute to the last. Hope this gets the recognition it deserves."
2841,"One of the best performances I've seen from an actor, the film made me feel uncomfortable had me laughing and also happy and sad, my emotions were on a rollercoaster.
The little nods to the Gotham world was subtle but nice.
Make sure you watch this !!"
2842,"Let me start by saying, this is a DC universe I want to further explore.The movie does an excellent job connecting most of the main Gotham characters and the possibilities for a sequel or sequels are endless.
Joaquin Phoenix deserves the Oscar for best male lead. His performance of Arthur Fleck (i.e. Joker) is truly remarkable and with minimal dialogue, he conveys pain, disgust and an eventual decent to madness that will shock you. This is the most realistic Batman related movie.
The movie is a character and society study. On one hand, a character abused, beaten, humiliated and totally ignored and on the other hand, a society literary overrun by rats.
The story of the particular Joker is truly heartbreaking. From a boy full of happiness to the Joker. By the end of the movie, you are shocked but feel that you understand why Arthur Fleck became the Joker.
Don't pay attention to the ""woke"" media. Joker is an excellent movie and maybe one of the best comic book movies."
2843,So far the best movie I've ever seen in my life.. I watched it 3 times already just to know how did the joker acted like this.. Its simply amazingly done by the director
2844,"This movie blew me away. ABSOLUTELY perfect. I'm not a big fan of joker or it's previous movies but went to watch it anyway with friends and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Joaquin Phoenix was absolutely stunning, what a performance! This is ACTING!"
2845,"Joaquin Phoenix is so incredible as the joker. His physical and emotional performance is a must see for anyone who appreciates great acting. I also felt the direction and cinematography gave for some truly beautiful, albeit haunting, shots. Bravo!"
2846,"Anyone complaining about Joker not being true to the comics needs to tone it down. Not only does the movie take from several classic source materials, it executes it perfectly."
2847,"Simply the best, Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing in the lead role"
2848,"Joker is truly a masterpiece and an asset to the dceu and of course the entire industry.
highlights of the movie-
acting(Joaquin Phoenix)
direction
violence
shocking scenes
madness
dialogues"
2849,The movie was amazing in everything the acting directing everything and Joaquin Phoenix did a great job making the role if you haven't watched the movie yet I suggest you to go right now!
2850,"An actor can elevate cinema, a mass entertainment medium to art which elevated the soul.The back story to how Joker became the Joker is moving, disturbing and entertaining at same time. The story moves along at its own pace and the moral justification for have nots may have its distractors but it is firmly in keeping with the Gotham universe. The descent of the Man into a place where nothing matters is convincing and the audience is moved.Violence shown is necessary and not gratuitous. It makes you flinch but still hooked on to the screen.This movie stays with you after you leave the hall. The sign of a good movie."
2851,"No disrespect to Heath Ledger (he did great as a joker) but Joaquin did not hold back. The way he carried his character was overwhelming. The movie is a masterpiece. You get to experience all your senses, in a good way. Never seen anything like it. My expectations were already high before watching the movie and after leaving the cinema, the bar was raised."
2852,"I watched last week and 5 days later I can't stop thinking about it. You need to see this wonderful piece of art and revel in it's greatness. The script, story, cinematography, score, direction, costume, sets were all incredible and I haven't even gotten to Joaquin Phoenix's magical and legendary performance as the Joker. This movie is going to consider one of the greatest ever made and rightly so. Astounding work."
2853,Perfect thank you so much it was a great Movie super o
2854,"Joker was incredible! The film is a work of Art and Todd Philips should be so proud not only is it an amazing original origin story to one of the greatest villains in history the Joker but the film still manages to tell a story about a person that suffers from Severe mental health issues and how people and society affect someone, it really is a very deep film with many layers and makes you really think, in parts you feel so sorry for Arthur Being bullied by pretty much everyone he comes into contact with, and other parts you are confused and don't know how to feel."
2855,"Just come from a screening and must say this was an incredible film. Phoenix deserves all the glory he is receiving for the lead role. Philip's is restraint and proves he is quite talented outside the usual comedy film. This film is insane and the story beats are unpredictable. As a modern day comic book film, you must admit WB has taken quite the gamble and it has paid off. A darker DC was promised by Snyder, but BVS was a mess of ideas. Joker is interesting and you'll either enjoy or dislike the film. Ambitious and a film with longevity. Will Ratcatcher be introduced in future films?"
2856,"Phoenix by all means steals the show. His act is enchanting and draws the viewer into his world. You cannot till end not agree with his actions. The backdrop with its music is excellent and engaging.
But the movie is too dark right from the beginning and many scenes if viewed alone give it a look of horror genre based production.
All in all, it's a dark and surreal poetry with its own composition."
2857,"Joker... Brilliant!! 10/10.
Joaquin Phoenix... Incredible. If he doesn't get the Oscar then something is terribly wrong.,Easily one of the best movies I've ever seen.
It's a disturbing, thought provoking film that has beautiful acting and cinematography and for me is the definitive portrayal of the Joker.I'll be going again soon.This isn't a Marvel movie folks so no young ones."
2858,"Joaquin Phoenix is terrific and so is the film. Just like the era where westerns faded into dystopian anti-westerns, I hope we're going to start deconstructing superhero films. I agree with Martin Scorsese that superhero movies are closer to theme parks than actual cinema. He's nowhere near the first person to say it but he's right nonetheless. I hope we're entering an era in film where superheroes are deconstructed. That would be far more interesting than roller coasters.Regarding the film, I wouldn't have expected that a deep dive into the failings of our mental health system merging with grass-roots anti-fascist politics would be this compelling but here we are.I never really cared for Batman - he always seemed to be just a rich guy with expensive toys - so I guess I was open to the message but still, very very good movie (also very violent, don't take the kiddies)."
2859,An amazing performance from Phoenix as he sways from lucidity to sociopathy.
2860,"Best movie saw till date. Joker is that movie which takes you to BTS of villains that Hollywood has never shown. Best part of this movie was it never let you sit calm, because in every single scene some developments are taking place, and mind you not just any developments but the kind that makes you question why in heaven's sake are you agreeing to each and every freaking thing that Joker does."
2861,"Holy mother fluffing crab bucket this film is absolutely stunning. I was blown away! It's dark, funny, gritty, uncomfortable and wonderfully shot. This film deserves all of the awards. To all the people walking out because it's offensive to people with mental health please get a grip as someone with mental health difficulties I find it offensive that you are offended on my behalf. Next onto the Gary glitter debate now obviously I do not support the man and find him utterly repulsive but the song is there for a reason or maybe not I don't know i didn't make this movie but my point is are you going to not watch baby driver because Kevin Spacey is cast ? (Probably not). Are you going to stop watching lord of the rings because Harvey Weinstein is attached ? ( Probably not) are TV channels not going to to show certain films because an actor commited a crime (probably not as American beauty was on last week). This film is a work of art and what is art without a bit of controversy? In my opinion Phillips has done a bloody phenomenal job and has people riled up (something the joker would love) well done sir GIVE PHOENIX AN OSCAR !!"
2862,"This film transcends its genre in a way I wasn't sure possible, and it is all credited to the understanding of the titular character by both the actor playing him, and the director directing him. I am an avid Joker fan. I read the comics, own many of the iconic graphic novels that center around him, and I can honestly say this is the character fully realized. I was honestly baffled by the level of character depth revealed, not just in the acting, but also in the direction. This movie is literally Arthur Fleck, aka Joker's, point of view; and the director and lead actor take you down the rabbit hole descent into madness in the best possible way. It's both incredibly original, and yet incredibly grounded and respectful of who the Joker is, and what we the fans have come to expect. The movie is not for everyone. It is not an action packed thrill ride. It's not an ultra violent theme park ride of sadism. It is a very realistic, psychologically in-depth character study thriller. It's slow burn tension, the tension being the character's descent into madness. I found myself on edge waiting for him to snap, and yet hoping that he would not. I did not expect that at all, and I can only praise the film more because of that. It creates depths I had not expected, nor had I imagined. Yet there they were! In short, Joker sits firmly next to The Dark Knight as a masterpiece of comic book filmmaking. They're the only two films that transcend the genre, and they both center around The Joker. Coincidence? I think not."
2863,"The movie îs stunning, but the artistical art of Phoenix will ne rewarded for sure with a statuie!"
2864,Philosophy of the character and the art of the story damn what a masterpiece it's like going back to the gold days of fight club and Godfather this bring back hope in the cinema world we don't need CGI we need ART
2865,"Didn't watch a single preview before seeing it, and I think that made the experience a bit better for me personally as I really had no idea which way the story was going, and with this particular movie that might've been the best scenario because I felt movie took me more along for a ride of the unexpected rather than the traditional and predictable. With prior knowledge of the movie (which probably most people have before their first viewings, especially nowadays) I might have had a much different experience and not have liked it nearly as much. I have a hard time giving anything a 10 or a 0, but if I could I'd give it a 9.5, and since it's clearly getting it's well deserved respect I don't really feel that I need to help slightly boost the consensus rating for this terrific movie that will go down as one of the greatest ever as it's likely to stay right under a 9.0 which would put it higher than almost any other movie rated here."
2866,"Bleak, brilliant, horrendous and fantastic all at once."
2867,"What DC managed to pull it off with the Joker is something special. Phoenix's acting is just incredible. Every shot, every score and every bit of acting is magic. A Masterpiece!"
2868,"This movie is a masterpiece, well directed, the cinematography is beautiful, Joaquin Phoenix gave an absolute terrifying and amazing performance.
See this movie a second time, it's worth it."
2869,"Cinematography: 10
Music: 10
Acting: 10I loved it so much, everything about the movie it's really awesome, I can say this is the best movie of 2019 and one of the best movies I've seen in years"
2870,"Joaquin's performance is just truly amazing, I wouldn't be surprised if Joaquin wins an Oscar for his role of Arthur/Joker. You just can't take your eyes off of him because he's so captivating. Everything about this film is just amazing, This movie would have you on the edge of your seat. The Cinematography, the music choice, and the writing of this movie was just wow. This film is worth seeing at least once."
2871,"This film is amazing, I love every aspect of this film, like; the cinematography, the soundtrack, directing and... JOAQUIN PHOENIX!! This man is amazing, I hope he receive an Oscar for his performance. All the movie is beautiful, hope to see the movie in the Oscars."
2872,"A great movie and awesome performance from Phoenix. Told without the usual gadgets, gizmos and CGI, the movie tells the backstory of Joker and his future relationship with Batman. Intense and powerful, a must see"
2873,Great movie! Loved everything about it :) Great acting & great story
2874,"Thank you Todd Philips, thanks Joaquin Phoenix, and thanks DC for making and portraying a character like Joker. Yes, WE EXISTS! We are those people who always try to bring happiness to people but turn out to be annoyers. We are people who are born to be bullied. We just need cares, warmth from people, we want to be loved, to be ""kings of comedians"" or idols, but we are always treated like trash or a joke. We need someone who understands us to share our negative thoughts on those days, but no one listens to us. Are we invisible? When I watched the movie, I cried a lot at the theatre, for finally someone noticed people like us and brings it on screen. People felt disgusted at what Joker does, but I feel rather painful. I experienced almost the same things as Arthur, maybe less severe, but it still hurts me everyday! Actually, Joker just takes revenge on his bullies, he didn't kill a colleague that treated him well, it's just a tragedy for him, cuz he cannot stand them anymore. Remember, murders are bad! But have the bullies ever thought of OUR desperation, emotional pain they brought us until they pray us to forgive (other kinds of revenge, not mentioning killing or murder here)? This is a tragedy, but it's also the despair voices of people like us praying for loves and respects!"
2875,"Loved this movie. Already booked in for 2nd watch. If Leonardo Dicaprio can, no offence, grunt his way to a long awaited Oscar. Surely Joaquin Phoenix can with his totally flawless protrayal of the Joker. The movie itself is a masterpiece. Not just your average DC Comic film this is totally unique and amazing."
2876,"""Joker"" has been causing controversy and boycotts because of its glorification of violence, but the truth is that there is no glorification, not even a pretentious movie or danger as many say, is a movie of acts and consequences, with a character building excellent and exceptional direction, not to mention Joaquim's magical acting, ""Joker"" overcomes any distrust of his artistic factor, is a feature that uses the magic of cinema to tell a powerful and poetic story. Joker's screenplay was conceived by todd Phillips, a filmmaker who has an all-comedy career, and this makes Toddy get a better sense of his character building, of course, the director has a lot of inspiration from movies like ""Taxi Driver"". "","" The king of comedy "","" The worker ""and even"" Indomitable bull ""large majority directed by Scorsese-Who came to participate in the production of the film- and starring de de Niro, which is in the film, ie the young director is coming advised. Despite having a whole cinematic study of what he wanted to do, ""Joker"" doesn't have a perfect script, but comes close to that, his character building is deep and slow, and starts from breaks, we are introduced to a troubled character. and anguish and we have a first act focused on increasing those anguish and problems, then we have the absorption of a kind of social disorder so, in a short third act, the joker is born, it is an impeccable construction that plays between fantasy and reality. , this thin line causes a haze in the viewer's vision that begins to get confused about the social chaos and mood of the protagonist, from this point of view we understand a little Joker, a character broken by the society that accumulates sorrows, his momentum not angry, he's a refuge, he sees his sociopath as something funny, a morbid, subtle and deep transfer of feelings that helps build an atmosfer that of madness and insanity in a grand way, one of the best character builds I've ever seen. We have a critique of governmental abandonment and inefficiency supporting the sick and containing social chaos, the failure of public agencies creates a city prone to violence and chaos making Joker's anguish more easily breed, parental abandonment, lack of figure The paternal feeling that is strongly felt by the character helps him to become unsupported and loose in this sick immersion that all bases, whether family or social, are inefficient in containing his sickening momentum, is a critique of us and the system we have created. Todd Phillips gives a directing show, we knew the filmmaker had some technical talent, for good or bad, the ""If you don't marry drink"" trilogy is very well directed, but here he goes further and completely changes his driving style, his camera is subjective and there is a total mix of styles, sometimes we have a wonderful curious handheld camera that is peeking at the protagonist's metamorphosis, sometimes the cemera is fixed and seeks more ambiguous and open angles, the camera looks sideways, approaches, It moves away, it is a camera that causes a total immersion to the viewer, several are the strange filming we usually see in the cinema, capturing different points and angles of our protagonist, it is as if the camera was afraid of Joker, always contained and little focal, the photograph is impeccable, much like ""Taxi Driver"" we have a greenish, melancholy and dirty photograph, it is a depressing photograph that composes and of life the social anguish of Joker, the Other points are great too, such as the costume and makeup, and of course, we have a magnificent, theatrical, high and high soundtrack that permeates the whole feature, a track that looks like a horror movie, but works great here. Todd Phillips puts Joaquim Phoenix with his hand at the Oscars, at least with a guaranteed nomination, Joaquim does more than just staging, he understands his character, lives him and expresses his anguish and frustrations with frightening liveliness, it's a character delivery impressive, the actor lives his character more than just facially and psychologically, his whole body is shaped Joker's agony, his decomposing physical state, his anomalies, his weight in walking, his difficulty in raising his head, we have a delivery and a bodily and physical act too, it's a complete plunge into the heart of the joker, the actor laughs in a scary way, more so than he laughs, and we feel he's crying, his characterization is great too, unless something extraordinary later this year, Joaquim Phoenix performs impeccably and one of the best performances of recent years. De Niro is also great, it is wonderful to see such an important and remarkable actor for the cinema coming back to perform so well. ""Joker"" was very hypado, this is always detrimental in a movie, but he can meet expectations by creating a reread of movie classics adapted and conjectured into a pop culture character, an immersion in violence, insanity and hurt, a challenge to social isolation and hatred that we cultivate in the society of this always, all aligned to a great acting and direction, the film is not perfect, telegraphs some scenes and at one point underestimates the intelligence of the viewer, but it gets lost in its ocean of merits, ""Joker"" is not a hero movie nor is it for any audience, it is a heavy drama about melancholy and insanity. (Spoilers) = It's hard to say a few things about the movie without giving up events, for example its final dubiousness, where it remains open whether the Joker killed his psychologist, going out of his way and actually turning you into a psychopath or not, and leaving the character alive for a possible future continuation, other details are magnificent too, the dirty construction of the city where at certain times we defied the fact and we question if the city is rotten or we are seeing through the eyes of Arthur, where everything is dirty, The ""little dance"" that Joaquim plays after the first murders is also spectacular, it is a moment where Arthur finds his peace and slowly begins his transfiguration. Another interesting point, which already talks with the film's dark humor, is a joke, perhaps the most profound of the film, which is not spoken by the joker but by the director when he scales De Niro for his film, director Todd Philips is very much mirrored. in several films, some of them are ""Taxi Driver"", ""The Comedy King"" and ""Raging Bull"" all starring De Niro, where he plays a broken character who finds an escape in violence, Todd brings the niro to his feature and kills him through a character who suffers from the same ills, aside from being a sadistic joke, we can interpret it as an allegory, where violence finally returned to De Niro, another interesting point, is that all these films are directed by Scorsese, who was part of the production of the film."
2877,I give ten star for joker spirit. It isn't acting. MASTERPIECE. love him so much.
2878,"Before its release, I too critically compared Joaquin Phoenix to Heath Ledger (without having seen the movie!). But don't compare Jokers. This film is about Arthur Fleck. And as he transforms into the Joker, you will be dazzled by darkness. This is an awkward, creepy and uncomfortable cinematic experience. Ensure you're willing to explore madness, as you'll likely fall for one of the most enigmatic villains to hit our screens. It's very rare you leave a film screening, yet the film hasn't left you."
2879,"I made an account just to review this film. I have been hyped since the first trailer dropped (which I must have watched several dozen times, and several more in the run up to the release), and had the pleasure of seeing it last night.This was hands down one of the greatest cinematic experiences I have had the pleasure of being part of. There's nothing I can say that hasn't been said already. The hype is honestly real and deserved.Everything from Joaquin Phoenix's performance to the music score, directing, and especially the writing, was flawless. This was such a beacon of hope in a time when big blockbuster CG films are all the rage. All that matters when you strip that away are characters. If you don't have great characters, no matter how pretty your film looks, it's not worth the time of day - and this film proves that. I hope more directors and writers learn a thing or two from this. And I don't mean to copy: I mean to write better characters and stories.I'll touch on the negative media reviews quickly by just saying: once in a blue moon, a masterful piece of art like this comes around, and of course the media try to create a moral panic around it. I won't deny that aspects and themes of the film are relevant to this day and age. After all, art is a reflection of the society it was created in. There's two levels to art: face value and what the piece itself represents at its core, and then its wider connections to the real world. It's up to us how we interpret it, and that's what art is supposed to do - to get people talking. This film has certainly done that, and it's a good thing. It's one of those films that will be studied and looked back on in a hundred years, for both its cinematic marvels as well as its relevance to today.tl;dr 9999999999999/10 would watch again"
2880,"Everything about this movie was flawless, the music, cinematography, plot and acting. Joaquin Phoenix, as usual, brought the true joker to life with utmost passion and dedication. However, you are gravely mistaken if you go in thinking that this is a cliche action packed superhero movie. This movie is a slower paced story of the origin of one of the most iconic villians in theaters. Overall great film!"
2881,It's a masterpiece. It's not for marvel/dc movies fans.
2882,If there was ever a doubt about Batman having the best rouges gallery in comics..... This movie will clear your doubts. I seriously thought nobody could match Heath Ledger's last performance as the Joker but Pheonix did a wonderful job.
2883,"I was never interested in comic book movie adaptations be it DC or MCU. But when the trailer for Joker came out, I was actually drawn to it mainly because of Joaquin Phoenix. I've seen a few of his movies and he has always been an amazing actor. But boy he changed the game for this movie. Not one bit of this movie felt boring or empty. Cinematography is outstanding. Dark, gritty and uncomfortable in a satisfying way. This movie is a gift for the audience, and I'm lucky to have experienced it."
2884,"I have never seen movie like this. Watching this movie it will look like very simple but it is very complex. The direction has made it perfect. ""Acting was marvellous"""
2885,"Todd you are a brilliant man
This was the best movie I have seen even better than the whole marvel universe, the music the acting, Joaquin Phoenix IS the man for it, he IS THE JOKER"
2886,"Joker; the movie I never knew I needed. A cinematic breakthrough in the comic book movie genre, that despite being overly referred to as a masterpiece, is for sure a masterpiece. Todd Phillips directs Joker, the character study centred around Arthur Fleck, played by Joaquin Phoenix. A mentally ill man shunned by society, who finds himself on a rather dark path of discovery. This is undeniably the breath of fresh air the genre has needed since James Mangold's Logan.Without doubt the films greatest success, is it's ability to have you empathise and sympathise with an antagonist. Todd Phillips took one of the greatest 'villains' in comic history, and made him a relatable character. Utilising the character study format of story telling was key to accomplishing this success, as seeing the events of Arthur Fleck's life through his own eyes feels as engaging as ever. Remaining on the 'dark and gritty' side of comic book movies, the plot consists of many appropriate comments on todays society which add to not only the character of the joker but help shed light on a subject very present in our time. Make no mistake, this is a vastly disturbing film at times, the synergy between Hildur Guðnadóttin's gripping score and the imagery on screen is like a schizophrenic nightmare in the best way possible. I don't think I've ever endured such range of emotions throughout a film before. Joaquin Phoenix masterfully embodies the role of both Arthur Fleck and Joker, which is putting it lightly.Visuals and production design are a phenomenal display. Gotham City not only feels like an authentic city, but becomes a character in itself. The film is enriched with colour grading and light/shadows that accommodate what tone is being conveyed. This is a film that uses visual storytelling where it can and to it's best advantage, a unique aspect of Joker. The movie in general certainly feels inspired by some of Martin Scorsese's flicks, which only makes sense due to former arrangements for him to produce, if you're a fan of Scorsese you're sure to get a kick out of this film. As I mentioned beforehand this film is a breath of fresh air for the genre. This isn't your typical superhero punch em' up loaded with insane visual effects, action and world-devastating events. This is a charmingly stylised, grounded depiction of a comic book character who could theoretically exist. Again, Pheonix puts everything into this character and embodies his role. Todd Phillips' passion project met with Joaquin Phoenix's immaculate performance creates something really special that seems to have earned itself the title of an instant classic.Whether you're hunting a flawless movie or you're just tired of the loud theme parks comic book movies have become today and are looking for something truly unique, this one exceeds all expectations."
2887,"Joaquin Phoenix really showed that he is a better joker than Ledger. which is saying A LOT that Heath Ledger had the best performance ever. the film is absolutely incredible with emotional and insane moments that you dont expect. I am a Dc, and Marvel fan and have seen everything. and in my opinion Joker was just as good if not better than The Dark Knight."
2888,One of the best movies ever ✌ oscar worth for phoenix
2889,Absolutely brilliant film Oscars abound. It's a very real insight into mental health and the apathy towards it in our society. Phoenix is awe inspiring in his performance as Joker and made it his own in a very real and vulnerable way!! Just sublime to experience.
2890,What a brilliant film had me gripped to my seat I was so hooked to the screen phoniex was excellent as the joker. The role was played like he become the character 5 star rating from me.
2891,"The movie,the cast and the writing is truly a work of wonder.
Joaquin Pheonix nailed the character and his acting bis truly amazing..."
2892,An unexpected visual treat pointing out the difference between DC and Marvel with nail-biting performance ofJoaquin Phoenix.Love the Scorsese references.
2893,"Joker has always been a controversial character and many have tried and failed to portray him. After the last DC/ Jared Leto epic flop, few believed something good will come out of this project and boy oh boy did Joaquin prove us all wrong. This is an Oscar worthy performance and the film hit ALL the spots. Joker's character has been made relatable and his evil deeds justifiable and that is more scandalous and controversial than any form of violence. Immaculate execution at all times, 5/5, WHAT A FILM."
2894,"Just go and see this as soon as you can. Everything about it is perfect. The cinematography is outstanding, with several factors setting the scene perfectly and just the overall performance is oscar worthy."
2895,"All the way through this film I loved it. No point in it did I feel as if it was dragging or too much. It is by far one of the best films I've seen in a long time. I would highly recommend this film but be warned it does deal with mental illness and depression on a whole different scale to which hasn't been touched on before in a film (that I know of).
I would defiantly go see this over and over again. Not much else I can really say without spoiling any of the scenes/plot but just got and see it and make your own mind up."
2896,I have not felt this disturbed watching a movie in a long time and that is the point of this film. Joaquin Pheonix is brilliant and this is a must see for everyone. Prepare to descend to the voids of madness!
2897,"""The true success of this film has everything to do with Joaquin Phoenix's masterful performance"""
2898,"I'm just a teenager that watches a lot of movies and enjoys them a ton, and this one might of been the best movies I ever seen. I would call myself somewhat of a movie fanatic and there are many more of me out there but let me tell you, anyone who's says this movie is promoting violence and says it's bad in any way are seriously tripping. Please take it from the bottom of my heart this movie is one of the most influential movies of the century. Just amazing."
2899,"A truly stunning film. Shown from the perspective of a mentally ill comedian/clown who the viewer is encouraged to empathise with. Shot through with some scenes of shockingly brutal and visceral violence. Joaquin Phoenix has never been better and gives a tour de force performance that fascinates, horrifies and excites the audience. Use of a Gary Glitter song has caused some controversy, but the music perfectly fits the edgy, amoral dichotomy of the character. Believe the hype, go see it. It deserves a hatful of Oscars, especially for JP."
2900,Marvellous film with everything you expect from a origin movie with one of the most iconic villain ever adapted from comic to movies really wells. Best joker actor Joaquin Phoenix since Heath ledger joker. Just Wow!
2901,I can't say anything it hasn't been said. This movie is a work of art. Should win 3 Oscars at least.
2902,"Never really been a Joaquin Phoenix fan but his performance in this movie was out of this world! For those that felt this movie was boring completely missed the point, this wasn't intended to be a CGI filled action flick. This movie dove into the madness of a man who then becomes The Joker and JP hit it out of the park, Heath Ledger would've been proud! If you are expecting a Dark Knight film, you will be disappointed."
2903,"One of the best movies I've ever seen. The way they capture his slow decent to darkness is fantastic.
The ending is perfect setting up the Batman story and truly showing how crazy the joker is.
You watch him grow more evil and you want him to be good and not do bad things but he does. The brutal murders on the subway and the tv show add to the jokers character development by showing how when he kills someone he feels good and likes it. And all the controversy about this really happening is stupid and everyone who says it needs to grow up and enjoy a perfect movie"
2904,"Joker movie is a clinic on what quality filmmaking is. Just to be clear I'm speaking from an artistic standpoint, not a political one. Seriously this movie was awesome. Top to bottom, outstanding. If this doesn't clean up at the Oscars then there's seriously a flaw in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences. Phoenix was hauntingly brilliant and so was the photography and score. Even down to the noisy film grain effect. Incredibly well done. Outstanding."
2905,Joaquin Phoenix presents his character perfectly. This is the perfect way to create an origin story.
2906,"I have to say that what we have here is a one off Masterpiece film directed by Todd Philips. First congrats to him and his team for putting out there one of the best realistic comic films of all time. This is where DC beat marvel because the DC villain Joker and Harvey Dent can actual happen in real life.So first to all comic fans, calm down and remember that this is a very different take on the Joker. this film does not follow any of the comic materials. This film has been made in a realistic way where it shows how society can push someone to their limits and we humans can effect people lives without even notice them.This films is a story about how someone can be pushed because of how society can treat and push someone and when someone has nothing to lose you will start to do things that you have never done. This guy was pushed so much that he started not to care and wanted to just feel good about himself. He started to find himself and his confidence is growing by the end of the film.You can't compare this joker version to any of there other joker version especially Heath's Joker because in the Dark Knight his version of the Joker has already established himself as the clown prince of crime where as Joaquin version of the Joker does not really know who he is, as the film goes on, he is trying to find himself and by the end of the film it looks like he has found himself that he looks set to explore who he is and I hope that if we can get two more films then each of the films will explore how he becomes the clown prince of crime and how he comes the most feared villain of Gotham city and Batman's most hated enemy.So remember when you hardcore comic fans watch this film, you need to remember that this is kinda of like an origins story of how someone in this case, this person becomes the joker who is becoming the someone who later will be known as the Joker or not. we have to many fan theories like this is this first joker and then we have three jokers but whatever, forget about all of the theories and go and enjoy this masterpiece. This film has a amazing soundtrack which strengthen all of the scenes which makes this film even more special. Also its not any other comic film like marvel who use too much CGI and most of their villains are not realistic which makes it sometimes not believe. I say that this film beats Marvel endgame and this has to be my favourite comic film of this year. I hope we get to see more two more films of this version of the Joker.This film does focus on people who suffer mental illness and it shows how we need to help more people in the world who suffer with mental illness and also treat everyone with full respect and help each other.So please to all fans, go and watch this film in the cinema as this is one of those films that you must watch in the cinema not at your home. This film was so emotional for me and it got me up my chair a few times. I will rate this film 5/5 stars and 10/10 rating."
2907,"Amidst all the hype and controversy, Joaquin Phoenix shines as bright as this film is dark. The score perfectly sets the mood and acts as an eerie backdrop to the film throughout. The plot is revealed from the story and doesn't rely on narration to carry the film. You can tell Joaquin Phoenix did his homework, his portrayal of a mentally ill man struggling to survive in a time of economic hardship is masterful. He is supported by a well selected cast, including the best depiction of Bruce Wayne seen on screen. They didn't reduce Dante Pereira-Olson's Bruce into a whining bratty child as many incarnations usually do. The movie mixes the plight of our down on his luck protagonist and provides an in depth look into the current sociologic climate, without weighing down the film. An excellent blend of comic accuracy and realism is used to create something comic fans and movie fans without knowledge of the character can both enjoy."
2908,"This film will go down in history. Simply amazing. The whole team behind this film should be commended, as well as proud of what they have produced. Throughout the years there are many films which simply come from Hollywood and satisfy viewers but are predictable with limited long lasting impact. This is not one of those films, you will walk out of Joker with your head in the stars, unable to Express what you have just seen. Joaquin delivers the best character portrayal I have ever seen, displaying the transition from Arthur Fleck to the Joker right the way through the film. I found myself smiling at his ability to deliver a perfect personality and mannerisms which we saw from Ledger, and although Heath gave us an amazing foundation when creating his Joker, I honestly believe Joaquin has made Heath proud. I don't believe I will see a film of this capacity for a very long time, and it is almost certain the film will win best actor and best director come the Oscar's in 2020."
2909,A masterpiece. Excellent filming and acting. One of the best movies in a while.
2910,"I enjoyed watching the movie, Joaquin Phoenix, music, story and everything about this movie. 😍🤡
""Put on a happy face"""
2911,"This movie opens up what goes into the mind of a troubled person. Scenes and circumstances is very relatable for the viewers and you can really feel how messed up Joker's life was prior to being Joker. In real life, these things happen behind the scene. While everyone thought everyone should be happy, there are times that life will not allow you to be. To be honest, the story line itself could trigger a lot of things. It could encourage people to stand up for themselves but the ""how"" of it will depend on the people. Truly, Joker set a high bar for other super hero movies. It showed the dark side of reality and the selfishness of humanity."
2912,"Joaquin Phoenix played the role of the 'Joker' amazingly, he absolutely deserves an Oscar for his performance. It is a compelling Villian. A dark, disturbing and sinister feel was certainly created throughout the film, which is exactly what I wanted to see!The combination of the cinematography and mise en scene with the acting worked incredibly well. This is almost solely due to the fantastic acting quality. You will stay immersed throughout the entirety of the movie and the dark plot adds to this.It is one of the best movies I have seen in a while! I will give the movie a 9/10!"
2913,Outstanding film. Acting was superb and this was a complete breath of fresh air compared to the other bang bang woo super hero films with zero depth. Joquin is an outstanding actor. Cinematagrophy was brilliant. I wouldn't ever call a film about comic book hero's powerful but Joker is indeed a powerful film
2914,Can't wait to have a second watch. This guy can act !
2915,"Best DC Movie, We Need Now Batman vs Joker moviee, Love this Moviee Alottttt"
2916,"The performance of Joaquin Phoenix is spectacular, the cinematography is beautiful, and the music is embedded in the film as I've never seen or heard before. The film indeed makes you feel unpleasant, scared and anxious, but why some people think that's a bad thing? It just demonstrates how good this movie is, immersing you in the story from begging to end. The fact that you sympathize with a mistreated person only makes you human, It has nothing to do with agreeing with violence. On the contrary, it makes you realize how we should be more compassionate, and care about other people."
2917,Everything in this movie is Perfect.Writing is amazingDirecting is greatSoundtrack is perfectAnd the GREATEST OF THEM ALL... Joaquin Phoenix.
2918,"I have never write an review here but this movie is so amazing, I am totally impressed by the acting, the cinematographic and the soundtrack! This movie is an experience - I want to watch it again, once is just not enough. Oscars here, please!"
2919,"Joaquin Phoenix is every bit as good as Heath Ledger in the character, simply a masterpiece by Todd Phillips, J.J Abrams needs to get Phillips on board to assist fixing the DCEU"
2920,"I don't write reviews too often for films I see however as much as I didn't expect much coming into this movie I left with a profound sense of awareness of society around us and just what may set off certain people in such a violent manner after years of taking abuse from others and often for no other reason than careless spite and taking pleasure in someone else's misery.
The movie is truly a social statement more than anything else that many may find odious or hard to swallow but one doesn't have to look far to see how the film speaks to a lot of truths we'd rather ignore and make excuses for.
As for Joaquin Phoenix I never had much of an opinion of his acting abilities but this movie has certainly heightened his standing in my view and rivals if not surpasses Heath Ledger's portrayal in 2008."
2921,"Many reviews here describe the movie as being: amazing, brilliant, a masterpiece and a work of art. None of those descriptions are wrong. The Joker is an extremely dark, powerful look into the mind of a man quickly descending into his own madness and inability to cope with the harsh, cruel world that surrounds him. In a cinematic world that's currently dominated by comic book movies laced with humour and CGI FX, it's ironic that a movie about The Joker provides none of that, but instead is the most serious and real of them all."
2922,"This is a hell of a tale with some questions raised about today's tendency to ignore the mentally ill people in our society by the lack of specialised care for individuals.who need 24 hour treatment
What a performance by the lead man it slowly draws you in and you follow his unfortunate story to become the Supervillain we all know.
It is worth seeing this film and watch a master at work bringing a different version of the joker to the big screen .The cinematography is great ,colourful and moody and the soundtrack just works alongside the gritty visuals
So many twists explain why he becomes the man he does I am not going to spoil anything .
Joaquin Pheonix is my favourite actor and never disappoints but he has gone a step up here in portraying a very mentally challenged character here .and deserves his acting to be rewarded"
2923,"Needless to comment on Phoenix's performance, he delivered brilliantly as expected.
In my case the apocalypse of the film was the director, the way he built the Joker out of real life material is really astonishing.
I'll be watching for Todd Phillips's next steps."
2924,"He surely deserves an Oscar for this act, what a performance. There is no comparison with Heath Ledger which itself was a class. Both are poles apart but Joaquin Phoenix nailed it."
2925,"I never write reviews but this film has been ingrained in my head ever since I watched it that I was compelled to do so. It blew past my expectations, to say the least and my expectations were already sky high. Everything was so perfect! I'll try to keep it short as I break down what stood out for me.First, the film's score. It was so well made I cannot stress this enough. It fit every single scene and made them that much more powerful. It establishes a connection between you and the character. I felt what he was going through to the point where i was rooting for him.The cinematography was beautiful! Whether it was a close shot focusing on the joker or simply a wide shot showcasing the environment around him, it was astonishing.The acting was phenomenal and that is an understatement in my opinion. Joaquin immensely knocked it out of the park. He embodied the character so well. I truly believe this is one of the best if not the BEST adaptation of the joker.I will say 1 thing for those who are hesitant towards comic book movies, it did not feel like such. Even if you're not a fan of comic books, you can still enjoy it as much as anyone else. It has such a deep meaning which will leave you thinking for days. This film will truly, without a doubt, leave a huge mark in cinematic history."
2926,"I don't understand why people walked out of this film as it was a masterpiece!!
The violence was not over the top and very much in keeping with the Joker character, and what a performance by Phoenix it was! Never thought I would say this but it is on the same level as Heath Ledger's portrayal!! He must get the Oscar!!
The look of the film was beautiful and certainly gave the film an extra edge!
Hoping to see the joker come face to face with the batman in the future!!"
2927,"A true masterpiece in every sense of the word. A true insight into the deteriorating mind of a troubled man. Beaten down by society with little hope for the future.Deeply moving and uncomfortable with each act, this film pulls you into a very dark Gotham city.Very Scorsese feel throughout. The best film I have seen in a long time."
2928,"With an incredible performance, sound, photography, art design and script, Joker addresses psychological, social and political problems around his great protagonist. A combination of true cinema and this current trend of superheroes manages to create the best film of the year."
2929,"I still cant believe it such a totally insane movie that i just saw. Shout out to Joaquin Phoenix, the way he acting that makes it physically painful to experience, i completely stunned and this is the best villain movie ever! This movie deserves a bunch of oscars!"
2930,"This movie is definitely one of my best movie and its the best movie from 4 years i didn't watch movies like joker and the acting of Joaquin is a better actor than heath ledger but still heath ledger i going to stay on our hearts what he did in the dark knight i will never forget it but Joaquin had his way acting joker and heath had his way if i could give Joaquin Phoenix academy award i will give him like thanos snap he deserves to be nominated and the movie was in fire the scene when Joaquin Phoenix cried and laughed I couldn't believe my eyes this is not acting I'm telling you believe Me someone smashed his heart joker is real good movie
10/10"
2931,"One of the best movies of the year. Incredible performance, great music and great cinematography. Loved it a lot."
2932,"The cinematography, the acting, and the amazing writing that created this movie has put it on the top compared to everything else that I've seen this year. I empathize with the Joker because of his kindness and decency, it makes him almost lovable and relatable. His decent into madness is also understandable because despite being medicated ,heavily, to advert feelings of sadness and despair, he still feels that his unfortunate life has no meaning and people are just unreasonably cruel. Joker has a natural need to be seen and respected, like all humans; when he gets the chance to do what he believes is his calling, bringing happiness and laughter into the world through comedy, he is mocked and criticized nationally by someone he idolizes. Which impart brings about the recognition he dreamed of but the brightest light that shines upon him is unfortunately for the pure ridicule of his performance as a comedian. The aftermath of his instant stardom proves to the world the insane and twisted individual he truly is. Which emboldens the maniacal the star he's destined to be."
2933,"Fantastic acting, realy exiting cast and musics. actors such as joaquin has lived in his role."
2934,I just watched the movie yesterday and it was awesome and its because not only this movie is a about a villain and the story but it's about a person with a mental illness that is trying to find himself in a society where everything is a mess. The movie shows multiple emotions that can be found in our real lives and people are really suffering to find themselves in situations like that. I really hope this movie wins the oscar cause it is well deserved..
2935,"I have to say this is the best rated R supervillain origin movie! His origin story is brilliantly shown in the silver screen.
The society took him to the depth of darkness and then he just came back with rage and vengeance.
Tod Phillips made a great movie!
Joaquin Phoenix dessrves an Oscar for his performance."
2936,Extremely good. This level of acting is very rare to find. Masterpiece.
2937,The best for Phoenix..An oscar is a must... Deniro is wonderful and music is brilliant
2938,I Love this film. 12/10 Oscar pls. Joaquin Pheonix wonderful actor
2939,"The movie itself made me uncomfortable thee entire film, but shouldn't it? We are talking about one of the best villains of all time. This movie is darker than being buried alive, it's pure art."
2940,"What an incredible performance from Joaquin Phoenix.....
The metamorphosis from an already unstable man to an absolute monster is amazing...
This is one of the darkest movies I've ever seen and that soundtrack....... wow, just wow !!!"
2941,"The Joker was hands down the best movie to come out this year! Not only did Joaquin Phoenix do an amazing job playing the villain, the movie actually showed the backstory and how he became the Joker! It's definitely a must see movie."
2942,"A truly phenomenal performance, more than worthy of an oscar. A fantastically disturbing portrayal of a person, place and time. Definitely an absolute Must-see!"
2943,"Masterpiece, great acting by Phoenix, great movie 10 out 10"
2944,"The more I think about this movie, the more I appreciate it. Quentin Tarantino'ish without the comedy. Long and drawn out at times, but necessary to really set the mood.Fantastically well done, with an Oscar winning performance by Jaoquin Phoenix! I don't think I need to say anything more."
2945,"First of all, I'm not good with Comics and anything Marvel/DC related. I don't know any stories, or any facts whatsoever. I went to watch Joker as a standalone movie, like any other movie; and it was great.It is a slow paced movie. Methodical; you pretty much get to sympathize with Arthur Fleck; you get his pain and his delusions. Joaquin's performance is top notch!I liked this portrait of the Joker. A delusional maniac, hysterical, insane. When you see the Joker's' development into a satyrical killer, his descent into madness, it's fantastic.Overall, good movie! Not sure if it breaks any paradigm over what's in the books/comics, but, as a standalone movie, it is good."
2946,In your life you'll encounter that one perfect sunrise . The one perfect lover . The one perfect meal . You only need watch this movie once - watch on the big screen - it will stay with you forever .Disturbing Art - Unnerving Beauty .Masterpiece
2947,"Phoenix's joker is definitely different than Heath's joker . Took joker to a different level. But the main thing , do not compare the two jokers. Both show two different phases in the life of Arthur Fleck."
2948,"What an experience. At first I did not want to believe the hype. I avoided the trailers and wanted to experience this movie with a fresh mind. And what an absolute pleasure it was watching it.The movie beautifully and elegantly captures the perfect portrait of the Joker of our time. All the Jokers we had were portrayed to their timeline. And today, where mental illness is relevant in our society, this is the perfect adaptation of the Joker in our time.You cannot compare Heath Ledger's joker with Joaquin Phoenix's. Both had incredible performances, but Phoenix's joker is different. This is not the criminal mastermind we are used to. This Joker is broken and shattered.Overall, this is the best movie of the year. I wouldn't be surprised of this movie got nominated, as well as Phoenix's performance"
2949,"Oh, what an experience it was to watch this legend perform such a challenging role! He didn't just act, he brought Joker to life. There was not a second where I found the movie to be boring. It had my full attention so much so that I couldn't look away from the screen.
My favorite part was the descend of Arthur into Joker on the stairs. I just couldn't help but laugh at Joaquin extraordinary talent and the efforts he put in.
Truly a masterpiece that I hope many people witness👏🏻"
2950,An intense experience. Not a feel good movie but the movie accomplishes it's objectives in a way few can. Don't listen to the critics - this is a true masterpiece that will linger within you.
2951,"Joker delivers what it promises and more. A twisted tale of a sick man corrupted by a decadent society. It's clear the script was carefully written, and Phillips directed the hell out of it. Guðnadóttir's work also stands out, the music is as ominous and dark as the film itself. Finally Phoenix's performance as Arthur is something else, absolutely remarkable and Oscar-worthy. He carries the whole film on his shoulders with his performance, totally different from Ledger's but as riveting and astonishing.
Joker shows us more about the man behind the makeup, still it doesn't make anything entirely clear, forcing you doubt and rethink to everything you see. And that sometimes dangerous ambiguity is for the better in the movie, for it is carried out masterfully."
2952,"This is not some average villian movie in which you hate the main character. You feel sorry for Arthur and his condition and you get angry because society destroys him additionally. Throughout the movie you sympathize with him, you understand his actions and thoughts. Afterall, he is just like us - he doesn't want to be a joke to this society. And so he became the Joker.
Joaquin gave us the best of him with his dancing, laughing, crying and even muscle cramping. Each of his sentences, each laugh and reaction makes you feel something. It was really an emotional and exceptional performance which is to be enjoyed to the fullest."
2953,I just cant believe what did i saw today this movie will be listed one of my best movies
2954,"The movie was perfect , good drama crazy dark theme ! Actor was maybe the best joker he could be ! Not to much action but that's not the point !"
2955,"Joker speaks volumes, wether it'd be with it's social commentary on present times, or within it's own context. This movie is powerful, intense, and real. Todd Phillips has outdone himself both in directing and writing, he has shown us he has the capacity to make not only a great film, but a film that will leave you thinking for days to come.Joaquin Phoenix's performance as Arthur Fleck is nothing short of mesmerizing. He downright carried this film alone, that's not to say the supporting cast didn't do a good job either, everyone was solid. But Joaquin, he's a whole other beast in his own league. From making you go from sympathetic, to empathetic, to terrified of him. His transformation from Arthur to Joker was masterfully done, the pacing was great and the subtle hints and changes you'd get from him made the payoff much more satisfying. This man deserves an Oscar, and he WILL get that Oscar, period.The cinematography and lighting of this film set the tone so well for it, there was some interesting shots pulled and it really gives you that Gotham feel to it. Dark, gritty, and full of crime. The color palette was beautiful and it was used to it's full extent. The soundtrack was astonishing, the oustide songs were used accordingly and added to scenes perfectly. As well as the original score from Hildur Guonadóttir made every scene intense, horrifying, and all the more real when paired with Joaquin's performance. She is truly a force to be reckoned with, there would be no surprise if she gets an Oscar nomination as well.This movie is special, it shall be remembered and used as an example for years to come. No words can describe the sheer amount of effort and care that was put to this film, please go watch this movie, for it is not only a film for entertainment, its an unforgettable experience. I can't put into words my feelings for this film, but to keep it nice and short, Joker is a masterpiece.10/10"
2956,"LA SOCIEDAD NO QUIERE QUE VEAS ESTA PELICULA, LA SOCIEDAD QUIERE QUE VEAS PELICULAS TIPO END GAME."
2957,"Amazing acting by Joaquin Phoenix, the realism, the struggles, the songs. Everything is spot on, I couldn't find anything wrong here. Am so happy that I got to see this.
In 2019, Joker and Once upon a time in hollywood are my favorite movies."
2958,"So much hype, so much to live up too. And for me it delivered. An amazing performance from Joaquin Phoenix and a gripping story to go with it. I was gripped from the first line, and didnt move at all till the end. It has amazing suspense, and some pretty violent and disturbing scenes, but it all creates an amazing film that fans of the DC universe will love. There is not many films would consider giving a top rating, but this is definitely a contender."
2959,"This is a masterpiece.
A bold statement but a true statement,
Ok this movie is getting a lot of hate And a lot of praise at the same time as it is like marmite you will either love it or not understand and fear and hate it, stating that it's promoting ill deads... it's not you need to understand it and remember it's most importantly art in the form of a film/movie.Always keep in mind it's a fictional story with fictional characters, which is difficult to do as the direction and acting are so good.
Now imagine your very darkest thought's and feeling the one's you never tell anyone,the one's that make you feel physically ill and the one's you would never act on because of your ethics your integrity and your morals,now take them time's them by 10 . That's the feeling you get from this extremely dark and thought provoking story of a man who has past the limit of sanity due to ill health and the toll of a negative outside world.
It's upsetting and moving to see such atrocities, the cruelty of man against his fellow man..
But this is true to Life,if you treat someone so badly you will break them,if life is so bad to you it will effect you, the portrayal of this side of man's inhumanity to Man is superbly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix he pulls you into the suffering in a way that you don't want to be pulled in.The violence that insues is an equal and opposite reaction to the original actions in Arthur fleck mind, a man that suffers from mental health issues and is then bullied, beaten and mentally abused by every one around him.
During the film you feel sorry for him you feel sickened by him and you feel hate for him, the sign of a truly good performance.
I don't want to Go into any further details as I'm not the type of person to spoil it for others.
The lighting the camera work and music are a perfect backdrop for this truly disturbing glips into a comic book villians backstory...a true testiment to a great director.
My leaving comments would be looking back at the real world and some of it's band wagon hopping on statements...
This is a movie,a piece of art, and an excellent movie it is.
If you as a person can't handle how dark and disturbing it is then that's okay just walk out, it's perfectly fine to do so
But please don't trash it cause it wasn't for you.
Its not promoting gun crime
It's not demoting mental health issues
It's not promoting violence.
It's a film"
2960,Awesome acting & brilliant plot connection with the original story!
2961,"This movie hits hard, it'll shock you to the core and open your eyes to the horrible and cruel world we live in, nothing in this movie not even the interview scene felt over the top, fiction or comic-book-like, it can happen anytime and to anyone, the movie shows us that the joker could be anyone of us who after a life of struggling and abuse logically slips into madness.
Joaquin is a true genius and they better give him an Oscar, I mean if they can give it to the ridiculous super boring role of DiCaprio in the reverent they should give it to this sheer brilliance."
2962,"First off I have to say this is one of my favourite films of the year.
Joaquin Phoenix plays a great portrayal as Arthur Fleck the man who in turn becomes the Joker, trying to fit into society and let down by society and Joaquin should win an Oscar for his performance in the film.Other reviews giving low scores saying it's not a joker film and not like Leto or Ledger. Each actor adds their stamp to a role as this isn't what Joaquin has done plus this movie is set before Arthur becomes the joker so it's all the back story leading up to the finale and the birth of the joker.People giving this film poor votes must not appreciate the film and yes it's a dark film but it portrays life and life isn't all sunshine and rainbows.I'd certainly go back to the cinema for a second viewing"
2963,"It was well done, no doubt about it and Joaquin Phoenix does a fantastic job with his performance in Joker. What really grabbed me was the cinematography, it was visually spectacular! I loved the style. It felt like it was filmed in the 70's on 35mm when films had that ""look"". I really enjoyed watching it on the big screen. It was a treat of eye candy."
2964,"Joaquin Phoenix is a shoe-in for Best Actor at next year's Oscars unless Daniel Day Lewis comes out of retirement and does something truly extraordinary. This film will bridge the gap between comic book geeks and serious cineastes because of his performance and the direction of Todd Philips. Never has Gotham looked so exhausted as it does here. No surprise that it is Joker's breeding ground. Helpless and hopeless, no wonder that he turns against the ""haves"".
The Joker has proved an iconic role. Just as we talk about Olivier's Henry V or Karloff's Monster or Chaney's Lenny, in the future we will be looking at Phoenix and saying ""yes,it's his defining role"". His speech, his body shape, his eyes - all come together to chill you to the bone. Yet there is poignancy there and inevitability and anarchy. The best film of 2019 with nothing to beat it unless Abrams pulls something out of the hat with ""The Rise of Skywalker""."
2965,"I was utterly blown away by this film. After all the hype and rave reviews I was not expecting it to live up to expectations, but not only did it live up to them, it exceeded them. This film is one of the most brilliant films I have ever seen with a powerful message with the last 20 minutes possibly being the greatest piece of cinema I've ever seen. If Joaquin Phoenix does not at least get nominated for this film, then there truly is something wrong with society."
2966,"Dark and rich melting in my mouth yet tastes creamy leave the strongest memorable perfect senses after the movie ends, will love it forever, Oscar will bring perfection 10 score !"
2967,"Phoenix smashed it as a Joker!
Surely this is 2019 movie of the year for me, somehow doesn't feel like story from the comic highlighting real issues in the world."
2968,"Anyone going to watch this expecting a DC universe film is going to be in for a shock. This is a brilliant character driven gritty film who's story could standalone without any reference to batman if it really wanted to.Whilst it does feel in part as a homage to Scorsese (the De Niro part probably enforced that more), it is much more than a film about a character based on a DC character.The film does something special in giving us a comic book inspired character clearly set in a world we all live in and not in a 'universe' created for film. Joaquin deserves an Oscar in a role that he brings totally to life uncomfortably for the viewer in parts - which is exactly the experience we should get from a film like this.Here is a film I was actually glad i'd only seen a brief trailer for ahead of going to the cinema - the resulting surprise of what I saw is how films should take you on a journey that you don't expect."
2969,"Joker is a human origin story that dispels the mystery behind the character known only as 'The Joker', or Jack Napier in the rarely referenced comic book lore. In this adaptation, it's a downtrodden Arthur Fleck.
To me, this is not a comic book movie, it feeds into what is ultimately a comic book creation, but it offers a gritty realism that makes even 'The Dark Knight' look pretty.These are the days before the Batman dons the mask to save Gotham from itself, but 'Joker' shows how the vigilante may just be settling a longstanding debt that has come back to haunt the Wayne family, it even may suggest why Batman is merciful of The Joker - you'll see just how Batman's greatest nemesis was created - and it will surprise you to great effect; even if it differs from the traditional origin story. Some critics suggest this movie hasn't much to say, but in the context of the overarching Batman story, it absolutely does.It traded the notorious chemical incident and Chelsea smile for something perhaps a little less far-fetched - 'Joker' acknowledges the Batman universe, but the focus is very much on the concept and character that embodies the infamous clown and how the mask is a representation of chaos that can easily be spread, just as a mask can be used for justice. It's the Joker's turn in the limelight, as the Waynes are pushed to near minor characters, and cast in the shadow of moral ambiguity.Did you know that although the Joker was planned to be killed off during his initial appearance, he was spared by editorial intervention? This movie fittingly gives a nod to this part of the character's past in its closing scenes.The movie also offers an explanation for The Joker's hysterical laughing; what was once a tragedy became a comedy - and the rest is history.While fresh concepts carry this movie beyond the box office, it was slow in parts, and lacked a breadth of characters and locations. There weren't many grand sweeping shots of the Gotham landscape. There also weren't many subplots or cutaways to other characters, this isolated the plot into almost entirely Phoenix, where I feel there could have been opportunities to bring in other characters and perspectives.I disliked the subplot with Sophie Dumond as it didn't add much to the story, and also felt as if Arthur's character could have been more eccentric, instead some of his scripting was jarring, perhaps deliberately so - there needed to be more one-liners to reflect the Joker's natural wit and flair, although his outright strangeness was captured quite well, if a bit excessively.This movie delivers a solid punchline, 7.6/10."
2970,"Going into this film, I was unsure on what to think. I didn't wanna go in believing all the hype this movie had gotten but, I knew Joaquin Phoenix was one the best actors alive so I went into the movie with high expectations.Now, this movie might not be for everyone. It shifts in tone and pace a lot, there are political messages not everyone may get or enjoy. You mustn't go into this movie thinking it's your run-of-the-mill hero/villain flick', because it is anything but. This movie takes its viewers on a ride through many emotions present in the film. The script is beautifully written and Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely amazing in this rendition of the Joker character. He brings a different side of the Joker out for this film. Something I dont believe any of the former actors to have portrayed the Joker brought which is a sense of vulnerability. A sense of pain and sadness.I recommend you see the movie for yourself. It may not be a movie everyone will enjoy, but I believe it was perfectly executed and a downright masterpiece."
2971,"I was unsure as to how this movie would play out but I am pleased at the outcome to say the least.This origin story is the best to date, the writing, score and acting stand out to me as just awesome. The desperate nature of Arthur's life as he struggles to live in a torn city between the rich and the poor shows us how a person may be driven over the edge by the cruelty of the city they live in.
I can certainly see how this movie would relate to so many out there today, and how the distance between the have and have nots is unfair as it has ever been.
By the end of the movie it seemed inevitable that the environment he has lived in his whole dismal life has turned him into the most crazy vilian ever, and how crazy he becomes when he finds a purpose in life that he never had before.Well done,"
2972,"If Phoenix doesn't win Best Actor, I'll be disappointed. I went in expecting a movie for teenage boys and came out riveted and stunned. It literally sent chills up and down my spine like the first time hearing ""Eruption"" by Van Halen or ""Stairway to Heaven"" by Led Zeppelin. The Joker as reimagined by Phoenix was a tough act to follow. Yet, he equals Jack and Heath & surpasses them both in some ways. This film is worthy of viewing repeatedly. I'm a crusty, old 48 year old, who was 18, when the original Batman played by Nicholson was brand new."
2973,"JOKER (2019) directed by Todd Phillips and starring Joaquin Pheonix in the role of a lifetime as the titular character, is a film that explores the complexity, stigma and volatility of severe mental illness. Set in the fictional DC metropolis, Gotham City, Joker paints a nasty portrait of a damaged city, struggling with rising crime, disillusionment and 'super rats'.Arthur Fleck is barely existing as a clown for hire, living with his elderly mother in their tiny apartment; their only relief from the tragedy of their lives is watching America's favourite late-night host, Murray Franklin (Robert DeNiro) on their old television. Arthur has delusions of grandeur, imagining himself as a successful stand-up comedian, which is ironic based on his 'condition' that elicits unprovoked and uncontrollable laughter in stressful situations. A journal contains all his dark thoughts and is littered with disturbing images and expressions of suicidal ideation.The film depicts Arthur's descent into psychopathy, through revelations and events that call into the question the reality he was brought up with. The film may be deeply disturbing for some, particularly the scenes of graphic violence, that play out with the same level of overt intensity and clarity as the rest of the film - nothing is held back. In fact, the audience is left in a confusing state between horror and humour, since many of these disturbing scenes include brilliant moments of levity.That's right, it's not all psychological horror, there are moments of humour that is the result of Pheonix's mannerisms and his diabolical laugh. It's a physical performance, while director Todd Phillips maintains a consistently gloomy colour palette that is broken only by the clown paint and the clown masks that show up at various points in the film.Speaking of Pheonix, he is incredible, fully inhabiting this character and creating a genuine debate as to which Joker performance was better: him or Heath Ledger. Although such a discussion is unnecessary since they are both transcendent in their own way.JOKER is a truly incredible artistic statement that will be remembered, revered and talked about as much as the last great DC film, The Dark Knight (2008). While I am hesitant to pump out a review immediately after seeing it once, there is no doubt I will watch it again and again and wait impatiently for the next one.Highly, highly recommended
5/5"
2974,Just finish watching the movie and it was excellent! Joaquin Phoenix played the role to perfection. The best Joker yet in my opinion.
2975,"Ignore all the critics, this is one of the best comic book movies ever made. We finally have a portrayal of the Joker that can hold a candle to Heath Ledger's performance in the Dark Knight."
2976,"This movie is one of the best movies of all time. Jaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck really well, how he laughs and he is trying to express that he doesn't want to laugh, how he turns into a psychopath by killing his mother and the 3 guys on the subway how emotionless he becomes, killing Robert Da Niro and stuff. And I'm really happy that this movie was kept rated R because without the gore it wouldn't as great. I think that they should make him into a Thanos figure for a new DC universe where he appears in post-credit scenes and where they have a big movie where all the new heroes and Joker will go against each other in this bloody movie."
2977,"This movie was one of a kind. Was it all real? Was it in his head? Was some real and some imagined? How did he really end up in the asylum? So many questions and so many different answers. It keeps you thinking, all while telling a truly original story. This is acting at its finest, blended so adequately with details and background to provide a thriller on a scale very rarely seen. WELL DONE! 10/10"
2978,"I don't understand what movie the ""real"" critics watched. Reviews like the ones I've read online for blogs, newspapers and other news sites continue to make me lose faith in the supposed movie critics. After seeing their reviews and then going to see this movie, I am pretty much convinced that majority of them are just a bunch of hacks and their reviews are written prior to them actually seeing a movie. I can only hope that this Joker movie isn't just the origin for the Joker, but the origin story for the next Batman. Well done Joaquin Phoenix.What happens if you had just the absolute worst day of your life? Or worst week? That's what happens to the Joker in the comics. And this portrayal of this unfortunate man who, coupled with a city facing civil unrest and growing resentment of upper classes and disdain for lower ones ends with something that could actually happen. Is it right? Is the character one to be empathized? No. He makes bad decisions. He does terrible things. But that is the JOKER. Go for the story, go for the drama. Not for action. And not if you're one of these holier than though critics that write negative reviews just to bolster their own credibility but lack an attention span to actually watch an entire movie."
2979,I'm not normally one to gush about films. But this is a fantastic movie from start to finish. Believe the hype.
2980,"This was one of the best films I've seen in more than a decade. The character development was amazing and Joaquin was nothing short of spectacular. It wasn't what I expected and that was refreshing. It's a human experience and is relevant to our society, as sad as that is. I was thinking about this film for days after I viewed it. Thought provoking. Tragic and insightful. A must see."
2981,"Joker was a movie that comes along only so often and completely blows you away. You could hear a pin drop in our full theater. Joaquin had Ana amazing, Oscar worthy performance and I can't believe Todd Phillips directed the Hangover movies but now accomplished this.It's as disturbing as Requiem for a Dream if you've seen that, not the most disturbing movie I've ever seen (2008's Martyrs takes the cake) but this is up there! And it is depressing as well but there are moments of laughter. I don't want to give anything away but if you have a tolerance for something a little more disturbing, I promise this is worth your time!The websites saying it sucks are snowflake pansies that don't want to watch anything that might ""offend"" sensitive people. Nonsense. Go see it!"
2982,"When you leave a film thinking, asking questions, feeling emotionally hours later. Then realize that the movie has done it's job."
2983,"I was riveted the whole time. Guys, its worth your time and money to go see it. Only shocking thing was that there were many very small children in my screening. I thought the parents were either ignorant or irresponsible. Of course the kids were all bored & starting distracting patrons. Parents, please!"
2984,"This movie is a masterpiece. I just saw it in the theater today and I will go see it again. This is an amazing origin story for Joker and his minions. It is also a commentary about how far left ideology (Antifa), the media terrorizing people with exaggeration and lies, cities run by corrupt people until they are filled with trash, rats, sickness, and homeless, and turning our back on the mentally ill can lead some people to total desperation and violence. It doesn't endorse violence, but I do think it explains how some people end up there. It should be a warning. Don't let negative news take your hope and make you apathetic. Choose kindness. Don't wait for corrupt leaders to fix cities they have let go to ruin - make the city better yourself (like Scott Presler)! After doing what you can for your community, make sure to expose the people who are corrupt and taking in millions, or billions of dollars and somehow never fixing the problems in the cities that they run. Last but not least, we do need to have a better support system for the severely mentally ill, and not the waste of money NY city is doing right now. We need to help the millions of severely mentally ill people currently on the streets, not just have ""feel good"" programs that may prevent more.God Bless America."
2985,"People in my viewing laughed. Above all of the themes explored in this film, from a troubled man emboldened by the very society he abhors, this affected me the most about this film. A dwarf trapped in an apartment with a brutal psychopath is funny to you? Scary times we live in indeed, mirrored by this movie. Phoenix sensational. Can't wait for part 2 and the batman that has to take his monster joker down."
2986,"Wow! Truly impressed, nothing more to say.To Slate, Associated Press, IndieWire, TIME, and all these idiots who call themselves ""film critics"" - GFK yourselves. No wonder ""journalism"" are on decline these days, it simply don't reflect people's true opinion anymore. If it not PC garbage, it's no good to them."
2987,"""I used to think my life was a tragedy, but now I realize..... it's a comedy""WOW. Now that's what I call an agent of chaos. Best actor goes to Joaquin Phoenix for his incredible intense mind blowing performance as Arthur Fleck, AKA Joker. This is the origin story to beat all origin stories. I was thoroughly entranced for 2 hours watching his painful transition from a beaten down sad sack to the famous insane maniacal narcissist we all know & love. I will have to see this on the big screen again soon, it was a brilliantly laid out psychological character study that gave me a lot to think about when it comes to the DC world of the caped crusader's nemesis I've always known. This story has a major shift to how I've perceived the crazed, hapless, clownfaced criminal, since I first saw him portrayed by Jack Nicholson in Tim Burton's 1989 Batman, & of course, fairly different than the outstanding portrayal by Heath in TDK. Arthur just keeps having one bad day after another, so I felt sorry for him in this story as I never had before.The score by Icelandic composer Hildur Guðnadóttir that was heavily powered by her dramatic cello was a perfect match to show how this story unfolds, & the classic Sinatra songs, ""Send in the Clowns"" & ""That's Life"" along with ""Jimmy Durante's ""Smile"" were a natural choice for the soundtrack as well as several old rock songs like Cream's ""White Room"", The Guess Who's ""Laughing"", The Doors ""People Are Strange"", Pink Floyd's ""Brain Damage"", & The Bee Gees ""I Started A Joke"" (just to name a few) went so well with the character development.If you're expecting a comic book super villain story similar to the previous versions of Joker on the big screen, you might be disappointed. However, go see this with an open mind & watch the goddamn genius that is Joaquin play Joker as he's never been played before & maybe you'll love it like I did."
2988,"Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?
All I have are negative thoughts.
Everybody is awful nowadays.
It is enough to make anyone crazy.
Everybody yells and screams to each other.
Nobody is civil anymore.
Nobody thinks what it's like to be the other guy.
Joker (2019)"
2989,Slow burning movie....can't say anything other than what's already been said....a true film....great vision for socio ecconomics of gotham with the class war...genius angle to tell the story of how joker gained his influence and following....just perfect.I can now whole hearted express:. RIP Heath ledger
2990,"This is not an easy watch, but it sure as Hell is a rewarding one.Phoenix hits it out of the park as Arthur Fletch and his descent into madness is a display like no other. The supporting cast are superb, the soundtrack is phenomenal, I really can't find a bad word to say about this film. It's a masterpiece.It's a slow burn, but that works really well for the tale the movie tells. When it does ramp up, it really ramps up, with the final act being a terrifying thrill ride.The feeling I got watching this film was reminiscent of watching Breaking Bad through for the first time. It was uncomfortable, but extraordinary, and I couldn't look away from start to finish.10/10, outstanding."
2991,"Its a masterpiece and its been a long time that i haven't watch a performance like this for a comic book charter, phoenix is a legend"
2992,"Outstanding Movie with a brilliant story.
The character development throughout the movie Is great.
Movie of the year!"
2993,"It's an extremely bizarre movie, violent, different than anything else about heroes or that specific universe so...if that is what you are looking for, this movie is not for you... Besides that... Joaquin Phoenix acting is fantastic, it will give you chills, it will freak you out, will make you cry and will make you laugh... He Will be definitely the next winner at the Oscars...This is already a classic movie!!10/10Hooolllyyyy shiiiiii....!!!!!"
2994,"This was honestly one of the best films I've ever seen. I have NEVER wrote a review about a movie before, but I absolutely had to for this. The acting was impeccable. To turn a bad guy into such a well liked character is such a hard thing to do. The twists and turns had me gasping in my seat. Absolutely must see!"
2995,"First of all, let me say that I cannot emphasize enough how mind blowing this movie is. I don't know how I am supposed to enjoy a movie after this, it just won't be as good.
But let's get into it. It has been a long time since I hadn't watched a DC movie in which the scenario and the role play took over the actions and the commercial frills. This movie is realistic. It reflects the reality of a society that we might live in someday in the near future. I was also iBut the real asset of this masterpiece is Joaquin Phoenix. I don't want to fall into unfair comparisons with Heath Ledger, for the latter has had the chance to have a whole movie centered on his character. However, I just cannot imagine a more genuine, breathtaking performance as Joaquin's. I was in total admiration on each of his scenes and Joker laughs. He nailed them all. Also, the evolution of his character all along makes each segment of the movie more intense and more mind blowing than the previous.
If you're not a comic fan, this movie can easily lead you to it. It gives you chills. It's an absolute masterpiece that's not ready to be topped."
2996,It was the best movie I have seen in 2019. Joaquin Phoenix absolutely crushed it. It is a wonderful piece of art. The musical score is also phenomenal and works with the movie really well. Phoenix's laugh was so on point it was terrifying at times. PLease do me a favor and by all means go out and watch it.
2997,Should have been 30 min longer and would be perfect
2998,"Truly a masterpiece! The whole film was really shocking, but I loved it."
2999,There is no word in English dictionary to describe Joaquin Phoenix acting . I never thought that anyone would be able to play joker better than heath ledger but Joaquin really astonished me. It's the best movie I have seen in years . It was intense dark and exhilarating one word : masterpiece. A must watch movie by everyone.
3000,"During my whole life, with no exaggeration, i never saw such a perfect movie like Joker. Every aspect in the movie is not only perfectly embedded, it's a masterpiece on its own. Acting, music, picture, storyline, dialog, all these aspects was perfectly merged to get us such an intense movie, where The main character feelings hit directly our hearts. Joker has raised the bar."
3001,"This movie has to be one of my favorite movies of all time, it is disturbing, it makes you feel uneasy, Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar for this performance."
3002,"The hype is real , Once in alifetime experience 💕"
3003,"Joker is one of the best movies in history.Phoenix did an intense performance , probably his best after Ring of Fire. I was not surprised why the critics were giving it poor ratings. Because it is criticism which creates the jokers in our society."
3004,"Joaquin Phoenix At his very best. I understand movie is perfect, cinematography, effects, sound and character but Joaquin proves that he is a god level actor!"
3005,"First time writing a comment here but I just had to. The hype surrounding is real and well deserved. I won't comment story of the movie or effects, I'll just say that the acting of Joaquin Phoenix is top performance. His acting of sick crazy man a Joker is looks unbelievable real, you watch him and you feel uncomfortable how real it seems, in some moments you just feel sorry for the poor sick person and you want to look away from the screen. Joaquin did his best in becoming the Joker, he lived this role without a flaw."
3006,"Amazing portrayal for the Joker life story; one of his life story.Joker - if I am going to have a past I prefer it multiple choice.If you are a fan of the comic and the animated series and know the stray of Batman then you will enjoy and this movie.If you are not a fan of the comic you still get to indulge in the movie as it touches topics of social divide, isolation and mental health which all too prevalent in out society."
3007,"Joker is such a powerful film which at a certain point makes you feel uncomfortable, showing you what you don't want to see about society. With a stunning performance by Joaquin Phoenix and an amazing direction by Todd Phillips, this is one of the greatest films of the year."
3008,"JOAQUIN PHOENIX, GOOD LORD! What a performance! Best portrayal of the real Joker in my opinion. Movie does an awesome job in showing why Joker became a Joker and what lead to it. Every dialogue every scene for me is an instant classic. And it does not matter if it's going to have a sequel or not, since it is a wholesome movie by itself. Don't spend your time reading reviews just go and watch it."
3009,This movie is fantastic and Joaquin Phoenix is amazing. Every shot is beautiful and cinematic. Recommend watching on a big screen.
3010,"It was a good psyco thriller movie and joakin was amazing and he must win an oscar for this.
Todd Phillips did a great job"
3011,An instant classic. Such an intense and beautyfull film. Stop reading reviews and go watch it.
3012,"Captivating performance by JP, artistic movie that an an unconventional theme. Highly recommended!"
3013,Joaquin Phoenix deserve as many oscars as he can get for this amazingly wielded movie and character
3014,"This is so far one of the best movies I've ever seen. It shows you the real world. The real emotions of people, and how strong they are even if you are not able to see that."
3015,"Joaquin's performance is 10-star. You can tell the directing helps stylize his performance, especially the body movement, the dance, and the micro-expression. Cinematography is nostalgic, beautiful, with a perfect sense of desperation and rebirth. Some parts (like the date part) try a bit too hard. The change of mindset is painful but gradual and convincing.And regarding its story, it feels weirdly realistic watching JOKER in NYC. I've seen the filthy streets in the shadow of the vibrant theaters. I've seen the homeless crying laughing on the train, while the suits standing on the other side. During the blackout, I saw people standing on Fifth Avenue, hopelessly waiting for the never-coming bus while some others driving home in Ferrari. I've seen people having dinner in fancy restaurants whose backdoors are home to the homeless. Isn't NYC at an early stage of Gotham?"
3016,"This film was everything I wanted it to be and more. DC should stop trying to do what Marvel has and capitalise on this realistic R-rated style and tone for their films. Not many people could pull off a convincing Joker for an entire film, and neither did Phoenix. This film is about Arthur's transformation, he doesn't fully become Joker until the very end of the film.
This is the story of a man's descent into madness done in the most realistic way possible, taking little inspiration from source material and focusing on what makes the character at his core so polarising.
Aside from the incredible acting, the cinematography, score and pacing of the film married perfectly with Phoenix's take. No screen time was wasted, everything that happened had a purpose or a meaning.
The inclusion of the Waynes in the story was a surprise but a welcome one.
Laying the groundwork for the upcoming Matt Reeves Batman film potentially.
I truly do hope we get to see Phoenix do Joker properly in a future film, but for now I hope this is the catalyst to start the DC Dark series with more films in this realistic R-rated style and tone made for adults and not kids."
3017,Well what a performance what an actor a MUST SEE !!!!!!
3018,Didn't find any suitable words to describe what I feel after watching this classic cult movie ever
3019,I don't think anyone of us expected such an amazing movie and performance after all magnificent performances. My expectation was very low but the movie smashed me with that super character development and impossible performance.
3020,The movie was dark as expected. The last 30 mins were out of this world
3021,"From all of the kinos Joaquin Phoenix has been apart of, he can still give performances that secedes and compliments each role by unlocking the human experience. You're not supposed to feel empathy towards an autistic psychopath (incel), but Phoenix's adaptation of The Joker gives a nuanced perspective towards the cliched archetype. Critics who fear that this film will incite violence and inspiration towards the incel community are right. Had it been any other actor up for the role, they would have not touched the downtrodden so easily. 10/10 BNM"
3022,The movie is superb. You can witness great acting great direction exceptional cinematography and awesome story writing. You cant blink your eyes for one second and some of the scenes are so beautifully managed.Lots of love for this movie and rooting Joaquin for oscar
3023,"Outstanding performance of Joaquin Phoenix and amazing cinematography (pay attention to the details: colors, emotions, etc). The story was told in a way we can't predict what's next. With no cliches, I consider this movie a hell of a masterpiece."
3024,"Those type of dark movies comes after ages's. Comparison between Joaquin Phoenix and Heath Ledger was disgrace for their skills. Joaquin Phoenix was absolutely wonderful as Joker. And the best thing is that the movie didn't leave its plot. In short the movie is wonderfully created please go out and watch its just 10 on 10.
Thanks"
3025,"It's going to take me a few more viewings to grasp this movie, which already tells me that it's a masterpiece."
3026,Joaquin Phoenix best performance to date. This movie is genius. Must see.
3027,"The screenplay is by far the best of the movie, it was tailored to Phoenix, and he embraced as a real master. Even if you think expectations are going to affect your journey trough this movie, don't worry about it, is just better that you might ever think. A new cult movie has born and a legendary performance takes place, you can see how Joker borns a one of the best actors of its generation gives you the performance of his life."
3028,Remarkable direction and excellent acting. We need more films similar to this.
3029,"This movie is a complete masterpiece of film making. Phoenix pulls off by far THE BEST Joker performance of all time. Ledger can't even come close to how good this is.
The cinematography and the music score were outstanding and nicely fit the performance that was delivered.Just pure perfection!!!"
3030,"This is a movie you hope it will never end. The man is struggling to stay in the reality, but failed. How the angle of camera, the music, the light and the acting from Phoenix drive you, a little, into madness. It's a pretty dark movie showing a man drive into sanity and you will love it. A pretty good movie. I will see it again soon."
3031,"Wow! The problems of real world and how they darken our souls.Some of the problems he was dealing with hit very close to home and I can easily understand the rage each of us can feel when confronted with society's hierarchy and how some of us are treated like we're disposable. When that rage is combined with mental illness, it ignites a flame in this movie.This movie also creates a very believable origin story for the Joker. Very good. Go and see it."
3032,"A couple of off parts in the sense of the age gap between joker and Bruce Wayne, the death of Thomas Wayne may be slightly off but needed to suit the movie.
the story in the way of getting to known the joker was perfect. You feel both sympathy and fear. The 2 hours flew by.
Overall a must watch for everyone not only comic book fans"
3033,The film is very beautiful and will not be repeated and the performance of Joaquin is legendary
3034,"I truly believe that this is more than acting , a great great film"
3035,"Not only is the Joker the best comic book adaptation on film I have ever seen, it is by far the best film of 2019 I've seen. The moments that gave me chills were the scene when Arthur is holding little Bruce's face and then when he is in the stairwell with his mother's medical chart and verifies everything Tom Wayne told me was true about his mother. Learning everything he thought he knew was a lie and the anger that grew within him that bought him to such disillusionment with his world it made him kill the one person he most loved in his world and turn him into the psychopathic killer. Her death killed Arthur Fleck and reincarnated him into the Joker. The twist with Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz ) was brilliant and totally unexpected.Wow. This film was like a Greek Tragedy play. This is the film I wish all other comic book movies were modeled after. Nothing is over the top, everything is plausible in this realistic world. No super powers or grandiose schemes. Arthur Fleck is just a regular man like the Waynes, but without the fortunes of the Waynes. Just a man who beleaguered with abuse, lies, manipulation and misfortune that snaps into the killer he becomes.I did not want the movie to end because I loved it so much. My bladder was at the point of bursting but I did not want to leave my seat and miss a thing. This is a titanium scribed A++. It is rare I think of any movie as a perfect 10 out of 10, but this movie hit that score. I was left thinking about this film hours after I left the theater. DC Black finally blew away everything Marvel had out of the water with this film. All thanks to a super talented film director and one of the best actors of our era Joaquin Phoenix. If the Oscars don't see it fit to grant him an award, then the Oscars have no redeeming value."
3036,"What everyone said.
But one last thing, I thing what made this film to unbelievably brilliant is that it was somehow believable. And I don't think ""Batman"" stands up to this kind of monster, because it's a very real monster that lives and grows within our society.
A man who of a tortured soul who has been rejected by the world now wants to tear down the structure of being in the world and everything in it.
And I think there's something inspiring about the joker - and there's the danger because there are people who have been forgotten by the world, rejected by their fathers, bullied and laughed at, born with health and psychological problems, abused and tortured.. And the Joker points to the answer is to cause mayhem and destruction and murder in the world to a generation who have lost all meaning. And that's dangerous."
3037,"Well, where do I start. This movie is phenomenal and if Phoenix does not get an Oscar, I really do not know who should. I have seen numerous way worse Oscar winners and performance of this man was not only very good or convincing - it was hypnotic.However, I have a one huge advice for everyone willing to see this movie - DO NOT watch is as a superhero movie (do not try to compare him to previous Jokers, do not try to follow the lore, etc.). You will be disappointed. It is an utterly different genre and experience.Watch it from the point of view that every single one of us may be in Joker's place. We just need one bad (good) day. And only then this movie will reveal its brightest colors."
3038,Beyond amazing and beyond words! Joaquin's portrayal as Joker is deserving and must have a Oscar! Touching on mental illness and depression really hits home! I have suffered from depression and I felt he understood and portrayed it beyond expectations! Tons of shocks and just overwhelming performance! Joaquin is the Joker!
3039,This movie a masterpiece of the year.i want to watch this movie one more
3040,"Good movie, top tier acting. Go watch in right now; don't even wait for a minute.."
3041,Loved this film great script and acting abilities by all
3042,Again DC most iconic villain shines through an unbelievable performance of Joaquin Phoenix.
3043,"The way the film develops, transmitting what lives and passes the character in his life is excellent, the people who demands more detail just.. go and buy a comic book, we are talking about a movie, not a book, the film's production is excellent, the performance of Phoenix is impeccable, no doubt until today, the best joker in the history of cinema"
3044,This is not a movie for everybody but go to wathched is the best of the year and i hope that will be nominaded to a oscars
3045,"This movie is bonkers! Joaquin Phoenix is a shoe-in for best actor, and I would not be shocked one bit if it wins best picture.I hate to say it; this is not the film for the average movie watcher. I know most of my extended family would be terrified and disgusted.I think the film industry needs daring films like this. In actuality, it shows a LOT of reality within our society.Strap in people and be blown away by this crazy ride!"
3046,"An extraordinary movie, the message is strong and we must all be kind to all people and respect them! An accumulation of extreme situations, which I can say may even be realistic and quite possible at that period of time, because there was not as much information as there is today, although there is a lot of bullying these days and can sometimes be an unfortunate cause of some dramatic situations that happen, but as a fictional movie (that's what it is), I think overall the movie is almost perfect! I don't know if will be considered for Best Picture due to the hypocrisy that exists in the United States, but Phoenix deserves to win any awards that appear, it is the best role of his career! From the beginning to the end of the movie it's a brutal character transformation and he drove it to the limit to embody a Fiction character who was always been an psychopath and let's say he already deserves it for a long time! And a casting that fits the story very well, although they rarely appear, are crucial to the development of this character. I'm sorry it's just this movie made by Todd Phillips and Phoenix ... But I have a little hope that Phoenix will be able to reconsider returning to the role in Matt Reeves's batman movie, as a older joker, if not I think Dc (Dc Black) could advance with more mature movies like this one! 9.5"
3047,"Now THIS is a comic book movie worthy of oscar attention. There's a lot going on here. We see the inside of a troubled man as he goes through the transformation of turning into DC's finest villain. Todd Philips and Joaquin Phoenix have created an emotional, brutal and almost painful film to watch (in a good way). The film follows Arthur Fleck's character throughout the entire run-time and the audience is pulled into this sad man's life as everything just seems to be tumbling around him. The way people treat him and the way his behavior unintentionally makes others uncomfortable is tough to watch but it is a brutal reminder of the hardships faced by people like him. Watching him turn into this downward spiral into the villainous Joker is entertaining, rewarding and disturbing. The film is about the evolution of this broken down man trying to find a place in society and then taking another path instead. This is a tragic tale done excellently. The cinematography and score is stunning, the directing is extremely good as well. The use of songs in the film are very well done. Every character really sells their role in the film, from the bullies, to the ones that try to help, to the extras in the talk show. Everyone brings their A-game into this film and nothing feels out of place. Joker is destined to be a cult classic and it's a hopeful change in direction for comic based films. This is a movie that will be remembered for a long time."
3048,"Has there ever been a character portrayed that has led to 2 people winning an oscar for? This is potentially the first for that, Phoenix is remarkable."
3049,"So this is my first ever review on here and i had to do this!This movie is unreal, no movie ever has made me feel.this way from the awkward eerie feeling to the intensity and epicness! This is a movie that touches on issues i think people should be aware of! Joaquin Phoenix's version of the joker is incomparable, you cannot compare him to heath ledger, they are just as great in there own right! I could say this is the best movie i have ever seen ourely for the fact on what you will feel watching this, Joaquin will deffinetly win an oscar mark my words."
3050,"One of the most anticipated films of the year, and one of the most unwanted, at first. Following Jack Nicholson, Jared Leto, and (the best) Health Ledger, was not easy but they got another renowned actor, Joaquin Phoenix, to play his take on the notorious villain. On top of the actor, the direction was up in the air and the choice of giving the reins over to Hangover director Todd Phillips was more worrisome. However, knowing Phoenix takes choosing his roles very seriously-only picking up the good ones-made having confidence in Phillips easier. Having a director suddenly switch genres and go in a totally different direction has been seen before and with Phillips, we get the surprise, and laugh, that we wanted.
Joker delivers exactly what you'd expect and want and then gives you more than you ever could have imagined. This film pushes the boundaries, it gives the gritty realism of the world's cruel moments their spotlight. It may receive backlash for it's brutally honest portrayals, it has already even before it was released. Though, it will definitely leave you thinking about it's many messages as you sit and watch the credits roll with Sinatra's perfectly themed song.
The controversies are created by the stirring up of the thoughts in the audiences' minds after witnessing Arthur Fleck's character development. This buzz does good in making this film more popular but more importantly gets the public to think more about the lessons to be learned about how to treat others. Sure, the main takeaways can easily be focused on the violence depicted and how striking it is, but it's the journey leading up to the acts that should be pondered on more. It's this very character arc that makes this movie so powerful and moving. It's brutal but it's real, that's what hits home the most.
Phoenix's performance is lived-up to and yes, Oscar-worthy. He clearly has taken preparation for the role seriously since he's lost over 50 pounds and nailed the sinister, contagious laugh, making his own twist on it by making it a condition of an uncontrollable laughter that Fleck has. You are glued to every scene he is in, waiting to see what unpredictable thing he'll do next, which is exactly who the Joker is at his core. Chaos.
There's also beautiful cinematography that complements with the subtle, yet terrifying, score. The clear and present Scorsese influence and nods-to are seen and invited, Robert freakin' De Niro is in this, come on people. Phillips also really brings us into this grimy urban 80's setting of Gotham perfectly. The cold harsh streets littered with trash and the poverty-stricken rundown housing.
Since there has been so much worrisome talk about this film, before it even was released to the world, you have to get the hint that it is not one to miss. However, when you do see it, go in as open-minded as possible or just go with premeditated ideas, the Joker is sure to rattle you anyways by the end of it. Either way, the messages and thought-provoking questions that this film instills into the audience is what truly sets this film apart. It's a masterful work of original filmmaking and we get to witness it, so please, sit back and just smile.
-TE (10.3.19)"
3051,"What an outstanding movie!! Joaquin Phoenix did an awesome job portraying his version of the Joker! Best performance since Heath Ledger! The legend continues! I love the pacing throughout the movie, Cinematography was amazing, the Dialogue was on point! I left the theaters with a huge smile on my face! After watching this movie, you will get a little understanding the Joker's origin. Must watch!"
3052,"How can I put it another way?
I'm a psychiatrist and I can clearly see the mental state evolution that gave birth to this ultimate Gotham villain, Joker, flawlessly!"
3053,"The acting, score, direction are in beast mode.. Its a Instant classic movie.. the movie is getting biased from Jealousy.. It will be remembered as one of the best film or cbm of all time."
3054,"I believed gone are the days when movies and especially Comic book movies were made in the way they should be made. I am huge Marvel fan but comparing it with DC Movies and comics is not fair. DC is dark and thats how it should be, as its meant to be dark. I found few people comparing with its hype with AVENGERS ENDGAME and few audience termed this movie boring in first 30 minutes..which they regretted later. The character played by Joaquin Pheonix's Joker is something this society created and maybe it got what it deserved. Low lifes getting bullied and rich class making fun of their pain is not funny. Each character are so well blended into story. They could have avoided their role in creating THE JOKER by just sympathizing and understanding our Mr. Fleck aka Joker.
The movie is so amazing that all arcs are fulfilled. I cried, smiled, felt sad and sometimes got crazy seeing Joaquin's pain. I used to get bullied in school days and i fought within myself so I somewhere understood Joker's pain.
This is perfect origin story because instead of falling in chemicals and going crazy, it was dark hole of life and fate and Yeah ONE BAD DAY which created something out of the box. The cinematography is so brilliant. Surely it will feel boring for some as any story development takes time. Just go with closed ears and soft feeling for Joker and you will enjoy this movie.
In todays era where Comics characters are supposed to be funny and humorous like MARVEL characters, we cant expect the same with DC. Both are good in their own ways. Perhaps Marvel could learn how to create and maintain the level of character till movie ends (I am huge Marvel Fan so dont mind). But DC is something and especially Batman and its characters connects with us as all as heroes and villians are created because of their psychology & pain. Joker is so awesome...i cant really express. I am giving 1 point less because as the movie ends their is yearning for something more. I hate critics for comparing this movie with violence and dark elements. Many movies are out their with billion dollar earning which are dark and satirical. You can't expect Joker to be full on Joker without violence and his dark acts. Out of all villains, Joker being the favourite had not perfect origin story till Now.
Now I feel after watching this I can understand and fall more in love with Heath Ledger's Joker. Heath's Joker as we all know it was not result of chemical drowning but of negative factors in society. This movie could be considered as perfect origin for Heath's Joker.
DIFFERENCE in BOTH Heath's Joker and this Joker is presence of Batman. Joaquin's Joker doesn't have arch nemesis Batman here and this bring more colour in this story. Their is few plot twists which i wont reveal. But character of Thomas Wayne felt more like a politician these days i.e. just talking and not dealing. Maybe I could be wrong but Thomas felt like a bit ignorant.
But yeah i loved this movie. All characters are awesome in their own ways. Hats off to Sir Joaquin. I feel relieved somewhere seeing him play this role without losing his mind which is sign of strong mind and sense of acting. Please Do Watch this movie and my 9 rating is based on what i expressed. This movie should have no sequel as sequel would destroy the arc. Something should be left for good to become a masterpiece for coming generation. I hope more origin and character based movies to be made. This Movie changes the meaning of comic book movies. Instead of CGI just a good acting, good direction, good cinematography and hard work gives us best comic character movie The Joker. Ending with an amazing quote from this movie
'I used to think that my life was a tragedy. But now I realize, it's a comedy.'"
3055,"Holy origin story Batman! Went to the premier of this movie and walked out of the movie theatre in complete shock and awe. Joaquin Phoenix was amazing in the role. Don't want to give away spoilers, but this movie draws you in as you watch the life of Arthur fleck crumble before your own eyes. This version of the joker pays homage to the predecessors in its own way. I really do think heath would have been floored by the performance. While some things in the movie were a bit ""cliche"" I think the writing did an amazing job of tying everything together and left us wanting more in the end. Lives up to the hype and then some!"
3056,"A jaw dropping masterpiece of filmmaking. I kept waiting for it to get violent as the media hyped this to be something that would trigger would-be psychopaths. And though it had a few intense scenes, what made Joker a film that put me on the edge of my seat and caused me to forget to breathe was those moments when Arthur Fleck was so alone with his thoughts and fantasies; that he allowed himself to dive headlong into, making the audience question of what they were seeing was really happening to the character. I often found myself empathizing with the pain Phoenix placed inside of the character. And I could almost never anticipate what he was going to do next. That is what made me afraid, for two hours, to draw my next breath."
3057,"Having just finished watching, I am stunned to say the least.
Jaquines' portrayal of a sociopathic, mentally unstable man's transformation
to the iconic Joker was non other than a grippingly accurate, realistic and touching rendition.
As unfortunate event after unfortunate event baraded the Joker leading to circumstantial wrong-doings, I truly felt for the character, while also being aware that his actions were wrong.
Amidst the action packed superhero movies presented today (and as much as I do enjoy those as well) this movie is truly in a league of it's own.
Joker takes the lore and characters we have grown to love and revere as immeasurable beings, and throws it in your face as an all too real, true to life possibility."
3058,"This is probably what I wanted from this movie. Dark, gritty and an absolutely grounded take on The Joker. Removing the DC tag would work just fine with the film as it is a standalone piece on it's own adopting a few characters from Gotham City and it's mythos.The movie works well for the majority part of itself, showing how Arthur Fleck descends into complete and utter madness as his life spirals down right before him within a few days. This is brought out brilliantly by the magnificent performance of Joaquin Phoenix who probably has delivered the top performance of the year as of now.He is explicitly raw, pitiful during the first act and downright horrifying as he goes down the path to become The Joker. This is HIS movie. The performance is so good that it saves what I felt was sort of the weak part of the script right before climax. The supporting actors are equally good even though this is a film primarily about Arthur.The visuals are brilliant and the Hildur Guðnadóttir's score and the theme is better than what I wanted. The script is probably the least good thing about the movie but it is solid for major part of the film.As of now I cannot find much negatives, apart from the certain parts where I felt the script lacked but overall it did pretty great to bring out the character.Will definitely have to re-watch but this is currently what I think about Joker."
3059,"Oh man, my jaw is on the floor back at the theater! As many great movies as there have been this year, this one takes the cake for me! Besides being a fantastic character study of The Joker, this is such an important social commentary that I think should bring up some much needed conversations. Joaquin Phoenix is a god and this is right up there with his best work in The Master, You Were Never Really Here, Her, Two Lovers, Inherent Vice and more. Todd Phillips deserves so much praise for bringing this beautifully twisted portrait to life. Everything from the cinematography to the score to screenplay was just perfect. I'm still gathering my thoughts and have soooo many. I think this is a film people are gonna be and should be talking about for a while. I am awestruck and gotta go see it again as soon as possible!"
3060,"10/10 This film is truly outstanding. The cinematography is gorgeous with unique shots which I truly appreciated. The story was excellently told. Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the Joker is outstanding, thrilling, creepy and funny at times. A superb Joker origins. I cant say Joaquin Phoenix topped Heath Ledger as the Joker, as they play two completely different versions of the character. But Joaquin Phoenix & Heath Ledger are number 1 in my books as playing the best version of the Joker. An excellent film indeed that will surely be taking home an Oscar or two."
3061,"Heath Ledger showed us that a truly terrifying antagonist can't be reasoned with. Joaquin Phoenix now shows us how anyone can even reach such a point. Joker is a character study of the clinically insane and wildly unfortunate comedian/clown looking for a break in Gotham.The film's primary strength is the first-rate performance by Joaquin Phoenix, but it is further bolstered by a number of interesting creative choices and sound fundamentals. Sound is putting it modestly. The prodigious score by Hildur Guðnadóttir marches the plot forward as cinematographer Lawrence Sher always seems to find the perfect shot. This all comes together into a fantastic whirlwind of surprise and jaw-dropping disbelief as director Todd Phillips plays with audience and character perception like puppets on a string.Joker is relentless in its character building and storytelling. It is without a doubt, film of the year."
3062,"Man, it blew my mind!As a Joker fan, I was eager to see Joaquim Phoenix's portrait of the Mad Clown. I was really excited, but the flick was beyond my expectations.It made me CRINGE, it made me CARE for the character. I felt for him many times, even knowing that the evil was there, lurking inside. It's a descent into madness, and it also makes us think about our place in a society. Are we paying enough attention? Are we caring enough for people who really need us?The Joker is a villain, of course, but he's also a victim. Or better: he's first the victim and THEN the (wicked) villain.The scene when he's ""turned"" into the psychotic and dangerous clown we all love to fear, is EPIC. The soundtrack, the score... DAMN, that was amazing!Phoenix delivers an IMPRESSIVE work and deserves all the recognition! What an actor, my friends, what an actor..."
3063,It's a work of art. Everything from the music choices to the acting to cinematography and story progression is absolutely astounding. It gives a massive amount of background in his life and what turned him into the beautiful mess he becomes. I'll definitely be wat Hing this again and again.
3064,If you want to watch the very good movie go and watch the joker right now this master piece Didn't have green screen a lot i think in this movie Didn't use green screen ok why this movie it's so good? Because Joaquin Phoenix this actor acting joker so good and this movie Didn't have second prime actor with Joaquin Phoenix he is the play every thing in any scene in this movie we see the joker even in flash back and the related between joker and bross wayen it's so good that's it go and watch the joker
3065,"I've watched a lot of movies in my life and I have felt that there is always something that could have been done better, but this time I wouldn't even dare to change anything it's a truly masterpiece! I have to say it Joaquin Phoenix was so good that he's now in my opinion the best actor and joker that has ever lived. Now comes the sad part! The movie was like eating the best meal you will ever have, when the plate is empty you realize it's only downhill from here!"
3066,"Best comic movie up to date ,amazing performance by jaouqin pheonix.really emotional"
3067,Just brilliant and with great parallels to Christopher Nolan's Joker and Batman movies. Phoenix.... How can you be that good and actor?
3068,Darker than dark knight!!! It beats endgame in the race for the best comic book of the year!!!
3069,"Joker best movie of 2019!!!
Joaquin phoenix win the OSCAR!!!"
3070,"By the time the roll credits started to show up, I was still not prepared to properly rate this movie. I would say it's one of the most overwhelming experience I've had in the cinema. After letting it simmer for a while, I'm definitely confident to say that it's one of the best movies this year thus far.The story of ""Joker"" shows us the downward spiral of Arthur Fleck, a down-on-his-luck comedian and a mentally unstable man with a disorder that prompts him to laugh uncontrollably at any situation that causes stress.That's enough of a plot description, because what you are about to see is a harrowing journey that at some point will make you so uncomfortable you almost can't bear it. Not saying that it went too far, violence-wise, but it's almost too depressing to be entertaining.Joaquin Phoenix embodies the character so well and convincing that you can't help but be in awe of what he has achieved here. It's almost a one-man show, to be honest. The side characters are sidelined (pun intended) just so we could witness his transformation from this meek, nice guy to the titular Joker. Still, Robert DeNiro as the talk show host also served as a highlight.I'd also say that I was never bored throughout the 2-hour runtime, given the grim and oppressive nature of the story. The slow-burn pacing is top notch and contrasted with some gruesome violence. Yes, it has visual cues from Scorcese classics (the aforementioned ""Taxi Driver"" is one of them) but there's nothing to distract me as unoriginal or something of a copy and paste. Some developments are really surprising and managed to bring some intrigue that will bring viewers to question what's really true or not, most importantly how it ties with a particular character (you could guess who it is).I gotta say that this has the best third act any movie could offer. My jaw dropped right at the climax for how audacious and sharp the way things were handled in it. There are powerful messages on how society works and how we should treat people with mental illness, especially to people like Arthur in this day and age that will resonate with me long after I watched it.Overall, I do think it has a staying power to be an essential movie or a classic outside the comic-book genre. Despite the controversy and the polarizing reviews, I'd recommend seeing it for how it pushes the boundary in commercial and mainstream filmmaking."
3071,Marvel cinematic UniverseDC: lets bring in the CLOWN!! lol
3072,From start to finish the movie was SPECTACULAR!! Especially the last 15 minutes... 100% would see again!
3073,"I went back from the movie yesterday. Phoenix definitely deserve an Oscar for this performance.Don't believe the critics, this film was one of the best films I had watched in my life. The critics dislike the film due to political correctness and moral highground. Come on we all know what is happening in the world right now.Yes, the film was definitely disturbing, dark and violence but point to the core problems of our societies. The emptiness of our cultures, the ever widening income gap and the hypocritical of human nature will still be there with or without this movie. At least the director has the guts to point out the problems and let us have the chance to rethink and rebuild our world before it is too late.We don't listen, do we?"
3074,"Best filming best actor best action parts and best story nothing to say
heroes always dont know the truth...
Dont forget to smile :)"
3075,"Simply put, the best acting performance I can remember watching. I thought no one could ever beat Heath Ledger's joker but he went beyond it so much. The hairs on my arms were standing to attention during the final 20 mins of the movie. Simply beautiful acting performance"
3076,"It's dark, bold, and harsh portrayal of the mentally ill person who got beaten down by the apathetic society to the point where he left feeling having no choice than to ""fight back"" in a brutal, deranged way as his mind is.
The movie makes you feel emphatic for the character, but not justify the things he did or labeled it as good things. it's showing us what ignorance, lack of decency, and a broken system can cause in the most extreme way possible.
The acting, cinematography, scores, it's all perfect. best movie of the year!"
3077,Joker is the film of the year for me! DC is killing it with their latest movies. I love marvel but this one is on another level. Give Phoenix an oscar!
3078,What a brilliant performance. His dance on the stairs was so great I wanted to get up from my seat and do the same. The shot where he was on the bonnet of police car was so dramatic. He is a superb actor. Nice direction too. Take a bow.
3079,"Viscous, amazing, scary, flowing, bold; again bold.
What an acting, seems like some movies are meant to be an all time great. This film will challenge DC to provide another one like this, the acting, the direction, the Flowing anarchy that captures and grapes you is really capturing.
Joaquin Phoenix Is a pure great magician.
Heath Ledger has a strong adversary, cause what Joaquin provided in this film is pure magic."
3080,"Its very hard to analyze whats going on in this movie, or maybe my head is flooding with words i cant write, since i was a kid i have always been a fan of dc and joker
Seeing him in batman the animated series(1992) or tim burtons take on the character or even reading comics that involved him made me realize not only how complex this particular character is but also how he can be written in so many different ways.
Today im 22 years old, i walked into the theatre thinking that the hype might be coming from fans missing the joker on screen, but hold on a minute, todd wrote and joaquin delivered!.
Legendary performance, great writing, moving score, great use of color pallets and a mesmerizing study/deep look on both the joker and society, thats not all, expressing to you how the joker made me feel throughout the movie is a hard thing to do, so i leave the rest to you.
Joaquin For oscars."
3081,"""Is it just me or is it has no flaw at all?""
""I used to think that Joker was a tragedy-comedy movie, but now I realize, it's a PIECE OF REALITY.""
""The worst part of making a good movie is many people is expect it to behave as if it don't."""
3082,"Just came from a first day first show, and let me give you a free advice completely straight forward. Never ever listen to the critics they are a bunch of sold ********.
There wasn't a single thing that could be controversial. Just pure Oscar winning performance by a great actor. And if some incel gets triggered from this then its his evil brain that need to be shot.
For me, Heath ledger was an unpredictable clown with no emotions.
Joaquin phoenix is a clown that blasted from pain into a monster.Some people will tell that (just to look cool) heath ledger was the legend and Joaquin Phoenix was good but not heath ledger level even after watching this masterpiece, but deep down they know that Joaquin phoenix surpassed Heath and achieved a god level(which is obviously many levels ahead of ""legend"").And that laugh, dear god that is just terrifying. you can tell by that laugh that the guy is in some serious emotional trauma.
critics was being like that this movie is so violent and disturbing and blah and blah blah. you can count homicides in this movie on your fingers.
Joker kills three sexual harassers, one backstabbing A-hole, one TV host(you should judge him after watching movie), his mother(which is not clear that either she is his biological mother or one who adopted him) and an Arkham asylum therapist(which is not shown graphically).
Movie is very brilliantly made. Everyone did a great job and hats off to Joaquin who took his performance to god level. sure in distant future someone can achieve god level performance but cannot surpass it.
Never listen or read to any ""professional"" critic cause they are getting paid for it. So they can't be trusted. Go watch the movie and make your own honest opinion because ""you are paying for it, not getting paid for it""."
3083,"#FinalVerdictJoker movie is a thunderous masterpiece! Can easily compete with the best comic book films of all time. The best movie of 2019 which belongs more in the Joaquin Phoenix Universe than the DC Universe.In the media, director Todd Phillips's Joker movie has been frenetically celebrated and a possible Oscars 2020 blessing (otherwise unthinkable for a comic-based film) is speculated violently. Let me say it loud and clear: there is not a word of it exaggerated.Joker movie is an ""origin story"", which tells how poor Arthur, nicknamed Happy by his mother, will become one of the most famous enemies of Batman. However, here there is no question of the Dark Knight, the story unfolds when Bruce Wayne is still a child.Surprisingly, Joker movie is totally a drama. A hard drama, rough, bitter, in a sticky environment. An environment that does not help Arthur to adapt. Director/writer Todd Phillips & cowriter Scott Silver take time to present the characters, places and situations.Joker movie is a work closer to auteur cinema. It's important to note that there's nothing wrong with this movie. Director Todd Phillips manages to infuse a very stylized colorful theme with the dark at the same time. It's bold, devastating & utterly beautiful.The sombre staging tackles you from the first second, shaking you through for two hours and never letting go until the last second. Joker movie is a horror story, not the celebratory tale of an antihero. Joker is a game changer and plays in a league of his own.The great soundtrack consists mainly of classics of the swing era (Frank Sinatra et al) and is an integral part of the plot. The congenial score of Hildur Gudnadottir amplifies the power of the images many times, so that every scene penetrates deep into the bone marrow.Director Todd Phillips is a revelation at the helm and does the best directing job of his career with the twisted material, able to strike a tone that straddles stabs of bleak darkness, gasps of hope and pangs of inevitability. I doff my hat to you sir!DOP Lawrence Sher's no-frills work to emphasize twisted, dark cityscapes, streets & nightmarish forms deserves a huge shout-out. With picture-perfect contrasts & color, sublime compositions, the rich and complex mise-en-scène succeeds in elevating the movie.But all of this impressive, stylish construction wouldn't have worked without Joaquin Phoenix. He inhabits his role with a commitment that's magnetic in its unpredictability. His unbelievable performance will leave the most lasting impression on the audience. Robert De Niro - one of his best roles for a long time! Zazie Beetz is remarkable.I left the cinema with lasting impressions & my mouth open. Beneath this gripping, bold, revisionist psychological thriller, Joker is the comic book villain we deserve right now.Joker movie is a masterpiece! Its understanding doesn't cross the line into sympathy, as we're left watching a man who becomes less & less human as his tragedy unfolds. We repeatedly see him burst into laughter, but can never rule out whether he's actually crying."
3084,Weird and boring nothing enternaining. I hated this movie
3085,Absolute Masterpiece. The best performance I've ever been Privileged enough to see is Heth Ledger's performance as the joker in the Dark Knight. I never thought I would be leaving the movie with more awe then that untill Ioker. This movie is inspirational and entertaining as any movie I've ever watched
3086,"This movie is perfect from any point of view😍if i can, i would give my vote for this at the Oscars."
3087,"This film proves how American TV, News and Films run off. I get the film and how some people like it but we can't ignore the fact it glorifies a Killer by using his mental illness as a sympathy cast for the viewers. The film has us trying to sympathize with mental illness patient who's sessions and medications is taken away and how society act towards him brutally, by him killing his oppressers and starting a riot. NO this is how America idolise school shooters by making them famous so that inspires other's to copy that and when Arthis realizes this he kills a TV Presenter live and is glorified as untouchable when the police car crash. This film makes it okay for people to think it's okay to kill and ruin lives so if some people are weak mentally than they will repeat an act of killing to be glorified and sympathized with this character. THIS FILM NEEDS TO BE PULLED BEFORE SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS TO INNOCENT PEOPLE!"
3088,This is a movie for everyone not just for comic book fans
3089,"It's very stupid Movie in the all over the world.
dam it."
3090,"If you want to see someone act crazy then go to a mental hospital in which I have worked at. This does not do it justice. Do not expect to see some great ending as it is just all one actor acting psychotic all the way through with no change in character and no realizations, etc. Sad to see such a high rating or it reveals there should be a two rating system: one for acting in which this is above 9 and one for the plot/story which is below 1."
3091,"This movie means nothing. They just went ""what's big right now? Incels and antifa? Those are the same"" and rolled it all into an existing character that could use politically and socially relevant anxieties as developing characteristics... but to make absolutely no ""message."" and no, films don't have to have a message, but it's so clear that this movie WANTS you to think it has one.It doesn't. Joker insists on telling you he's not political multiple times in the same way people tell you they're ""sick of politics,"" only to ignore the influence of politics in literally everything that led to where he is- and you're never given a clear sense of what Phillips wants you to believe from that point on, because the chaos is so much more intriguing to him than anything of substance. Whatever.i generally like Todd Phillips movies and think they're fun, and despite this having a stellar performance from Joaquin Phoenix and generally enticing production design (whoda thunk a Taxi Driver-inspired film looks nice in 35mm!), this might be the kind of movie that upsets me the most, because it insists on masquerading as something smarter and more important than the ""average flick.""And no, i don't think Joker is an incel, and I don't think the movie is about antifa...I just think this movie uses the social and political contexts of two big modern ""movements"" (for lack of a better term) as a sort of set dressing for its story. I don't think Joker is an incel, but his ""rise to madness"" is set about by a provocation in the same way that incels very publicly enact violent acts against women. It's this idea that they've been pushed to violence because a sect of society ('society' in a post about Joker, finish your drink) has unjustly acted against them and this is their rebellion. Joker uses the same sort of justification and refusal to feel remorse for his violent actions as Elliot Rodger does, but without the misogyny.It also uses Antifa in the same way- the imagery of political violent unrest and masks, all literally and declaratively set in a large city and staged to be demonstrative against wealth and facism? Both his inspiration and the images he wants to conjure in your mind- yes, despite being set in 1981- is what he knows the audience will recognize to be closely associated with Antifa.The thing is, he uses these ideas and images and characterizations in a way that don't really...make any clear comment on the things themselves. Which feels weird. To make an extreme comparison, it's like writing a road trip buddy comedy that pulls heavily from the recognizable imagery and characterizations of slavery, but doesn't... seem to have any particular stance or opinion on slavery."
3092,Greatest movie I have ever seen and I never thought it would be such a great movie but actually it is I recommend everyone to watch it
3093,"Joker movie created big hype over DC fans. Even Marvel fans got their interest over here. After watching the movie, I realized you won't be disappointed. Clearly the movie is......(out of words). I'm not giving any spoilers. You better enjoy the movie on October."
3094,The acting was great. The movie is long and drown out boring. The first hour and a half of the movie could have been told in 20 minutes. Very disappointed.
3095,This movie is by far the worst movie I've ever seen ! Do not watch this it's horrible ! Why does stuff like this get nominated for any awards it boring and slow and then gets gory ! All this hype about its so great well those people are the same people that are influenced by anything online lol losers ! I'll say it again this movie is slow and boring and a waste of money watching some gross skinny looking man that's crazy is not a movie anyone should want to go see ! Stop giving this mess a 10 ! It deserves a 0 it is sooooooo boring !
3096,Okay jaquin Phoenix did a really good job acting and the movie is really artsy but the worst version of Joker I've ever seen even worse than Jared Leto. very limp wristed and sorry excuse for a joker I felt like I was watching the origin story for Buffalo Bill from Silence of the Lambs
3097,"This was very hard to watch and not in a good way. All these 2 very long hours I kept thinking of Jack Nicholson brilliant job as the joker.
Do yourself a favor and watch Tim Burton's Batman instead."
3098,"I wanted to walk out, assumed I was staying for the epic breakdown which would be worth the boredom. Well, that never came. Should have walked out. Terrible, absolutely terrible."
3099,I should say other than the protagonist's acting skills nothing is even worth watching in the movie for me .It's such a negative movie and I am so shocked to see a 9.4 rating in IMDb. I just hope makers spread better messages than such negativity..
3100,"This movie is depressing and boring. It is trying to send some meaningfull message but it fails to do so. Majority of people who rated this movie with 10 are cringy wanna be smarties who think that they are jokers.
Dont watch this boring movie.
(English is not my first language)"
3101,"I thought this movie was so boring! I kept hearing from people how good it was so I never expected it to be so dull. The last 15 to 20 minutes were riveting but didn't make up for the snooze fest that happened before.
I also feel like I've seen the Joaquin performance so many times before. The actor who loses a bunch of weight and dances in his underwear. It's been done. Let's see something different!
I know this is an unpopular opinion but I just thought I would share my differing view of the film."
3102,"Slow, pointless & a waste of time.. the most disappointing movie I've seen in a long time. How did it possibly have to take so long to tell the audience he's mentally unwell & how surprising it was due to his mother, really?! As imaginative as a white sock.
Some nice camera work but otherwise over hyped rubbish. Heath Ledgers Joker was a thousand times better."
3103,This movie is simply boring. Too dark. Full of drama.
3104,"It's a depressing shock movie, posing as an unoriginal art house movie, posing as a lecturing society piece, posing as a character study for an actors award nomination, posing as a movie set in a children's universe.What's the point? Other than to make adults feel like they are adults through the characters of their youth.The ride is ok, but unpleasant enough to not bother with again - depending on your abilities in adulting."
3105,"When things are exactly as Great as you expected them to be...Truly a masterpiece, best film of 2019, one of the best films of the century, second best DC film after The Dark Knight. 10 out of 10 to Direction and Acting. Joaquin Phoenix goes inside the character's head and maybe forgets his true self. The best thing about the film is we feel empathy for a psychopath who DOES NOT feel empathy for anyone, that is so deep character, that no one can hate. A legend. Also the cinematography, background score, songs and runtime are all impressive.I wouldn't be surprised to see 10 Oscar Nominations and Most Wins this year.

3106,"Joker is a joke, a very bad joke and not funny. We find ourselves with a film in which scenes are repeated ceaselessly in slow motion to make clear something that is known from the first minute, the protagonist is an unhappy, idiot and mentally ill who lives with his mother.In a Gotham that has nothing of Gotham, it is rather the New York of gang members of ""The Warriors"", with a Joker that has nothing of the authentic Joker they try to sell us a movie that only stands out in boredom and predictability.When I came out of the cinema everyone said that the film was very bad, several fell asleep during the screening. I don't know where they get that it's a great film. Such a mystery.For me, the worst movie of the year."
3107,Joaquin Phoenix did a wonderful job with this role if this role was the orgin story for buffalo bill from silence of the lambs. The most depressing sad and limp-wristed version of the joker that I've ever seen. The origin story was not really that bad the portrayal of the joker whith his very feminine dancing and absolutely no masculinity was not any version of the joker that I remember.
3108,"I reluctantly went to see this movie as my son had seen it and wanted to discuss with me after I had seen it myself. This movie is the darkest movie I have ever witnessed in my life since going to movies starting in the 60's, which have included Taxi Driver, Silence of the Lambs etc . Not withstanding, Phoenix delivered an incredible performance, but the whole pretext of Hollywood producing such a piece...well it just sickens me. Why has our culture has stooped to this level? There is even a scene that appeared to celebrate and represented the glorification of the devil himself. Sickening."
3109,This is one of the worst movies that i ever seen.........
3110,This movie was slow and boring. I did all I could do to keep from falling asleep in the theater. I imagine this is a set up for future films but why did it have to be so boring?
3111,"The movie takes itself too seriously, wants to seem smarter than it really is, and for the most part is really boring. Phoenix's performance is probably good but I couldn't really get into it because i wasn't enjoying the rest of the movie. Oh and the laughter is really annoying, I get what they were trying to achieve with the mental illness thing but, wasn't for me... there were 5 of us watching the movie, 3 of us thought it was pretty bad, the other two really
enjoyed it, i guess it's one of those movies..."
3112,"Saw it at TIFF and I can confirm that this is a masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix is Oscar worthy, the score is beautiful and the cinematography is riveting.This is a must watch."
3113,I went to see this movie in Hope's there would be a good back story to the joker but this movie was so slow and boring I almost slept through it. I don't know how it's getting such high ratings. I wouldn't see it again if you paid me to. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!!! I never write reviews but I'm literally still sitting in the theater because this couldn't wait. I had to save someone else from witnessing this garbage.
3114,"I almost choked when I saw this film had a rating over 8, what a boring, steaming pile of excrement. 2 hours of nothing happening."
3115,This movie is awful! I don't know why anyone likes it. I kept waiting for it to just be over. Boring is an understatement.... what the hell....
3116,"Pretend we live in a world where people don't watch everything that is released, where people discriminate their media consumption, where a movie bomb means the end of your career as a writer and director, a world that would not tolerate even one movie of the Hangover or Knocked Up variety. Can you imagine that world? Would this latest Joker be made in that world? Would an adult gamble his career on a mature movie about a clown who is Batman's nemesis? A movie that ends up pandering to every mental illness myth and victimized/bullied syndrome trope and actually removes Batman's universe from fantasy and dresses it in hand-me-down plot points stolen from NY Post tabloids? No, it wouldn't be made. But we don't live in that world. So we have this pile of waste to watch. And we watch it and fulfill The Joker's prophecy because we are plague rats running over piles of garbage. And tomorrow a new pile of garbage will hide today's excrement."
3117,"I watched the movie yesterday. I am from India and we get to see these characters on daily basis in different forms. For us, its similar to an Art movie. Few people like these because of individual performances but majority will hate as there is almost nothing to watch except seeing a guy turning insane. Save your money and time and watch any light hearted movie."
3118,"Half of the movie is amazingly slow and dramatic. In my opinion it is really predictable after the first ten minutes. It is not a bad movie but It is also not one of my ""master-piece"" movies list."
3119,"Not sure this is the masterpiece everyone is raving about. It's all a bit predictable and samey.There's no creativity... a copy script of king of comedy and copying the character of taxi driver.
As for Joaquin Phoenix, I don't know why it's an amazing performance. He lost some weight, danced, laughed, pulled some silly faces and really just played it like I expected him too... No killer scenes or memorable lines, nothing out of the ordinary or surprising.It's not a film you'll watch again, unlike other joker performances, quite dull and boring throughout waiting for a big scene which never delivers. I left just not really feeling anything for it... hmmm yh it was alright."
3120,Don't let your kids watch this movie! Violent but also boring. Glamorises disturbed killing.
3121,"Acting, production and cinematography are superb. But... it's so boring. Excruciatingly slow. Totally out of step with the genre and vibe of DC, superheroes, Batman and almost everything else this movie inherently should be consistent with."
3122,"There were a number of aesthetically nice scenes, but otherwise it was pretty boring to watch JP laugh like a hyena for 2 hours straight."
3123,"Booooorrrring it's a good movie to sleep to. All the hype about violence and wonder, turned into udder disappointment!"
3124,"I mean, why bother with a bad copy? Just watch Taxi Driver and The king of comedy. Or better yet, take the DVD's, put them in an video editor, make random cuts of each and export a 2 hour movie with scenes of both. Watch it in bed when you are feeling sleepy so you get a little confused and I GUARANTEE you that you gonna get something pretty similar to the joker. Really.. not worth it.If you wanna watch an Scorsese type movie... just watch an Scorsese's movie."
3125,"Pretty close-ups of Joaquim Phoenix, if that's what you want to see, you'll get 2 hours of it here. The worst kind of movies are the ones label 'character studies', because then you are expected to like it because the lead actor literally hogs the spotlight the entire movie. There's no room for supporting actors in that type of film, you have to sit and watch the movie evolve around that one actor. The last few Daniel Day Lewis movies have suffered that same ailment.
On top of that, this movie just rips off Scorsese with no shame. News flash: If we've seen it before, it's NOT new. Homage or straight theft? You decide. Or not, just avoid this one."
3126,"Today is the first day of this movie, I saw it already rated as 9.2 . After I watched it, so disappointed. First this actor is over acting too much, this movie should be a half horror half drama, and whole movie like talking about a mentally illness people get abused by whole world, other people deserve to die, second the actor is too old, I think they picked a wrong actor, he is too old to act this movie, I can see his grey beard, it's like a 51 years old mid age joker. How could he has Energy to fight Batman after Batman grew up, actor too thin, Skinny, I feel he has no skill kill anyone, third is his voice, joker should have a deep or sharp voice, his voice not the voice, I feel I got cheated,don't waste money to see this movie. After the movie finished whole theater Audience feel desponded"
3127,"OMG, Joaquin Phoenix lost so much weight his shoulders pop, he laughs hysterically, and he can't dance. Acting genius! Give him an Oscar. This is the best movie since the last gory psycho killer movie I saw, and I just loved the blood spatter, er, I mean, this is an important exploration of mental illness and a damning indictment of society's failure to understand comic book villains.Two stars for this overrated, pretentious revenge pic, mostly for De Niro's portrayal of a smug TV host (surely a reference to Letterman) who cynically exploits the painfully untalented for audience amusement and derision."
3128,"I get the madness, the depression, the knocks, the highs and the tragedy. Every part of these traits is covered extremely well by the very impressive Joaquin's ""Joker"".But the film itself is just so boring. I was just wishing it would get out of second gear. Pleading that it might pull out into the fast lane to overtake the heavy juggernaut of another mundane movie. For this baby was the Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa of comic book movies. Surely it should leave all before it for dust.Sadly it never did.If you want to see a man's desperate fall into madness, sadness and then ultimately loosing it. Go see Falling Down. It's a damn sight better than this."
3129,"Imagine Taxi Driver with clown makeup. I've seen reviewers say you should watch Taxi Driver and King of Comedy first. I guess to put Joker in perspective. But this is a remake. Its a mentally disturbed guy's psychological demise, proviked by societal fecay, and consequential violent reaction. The end. Joachin Phoenix is more effeminate, and has some weird dance moves to demonstrate he is becoming his ""evolved self."" But otherwise, the other movies are better."
3130,Best of the year. Just like what joker is all about
3131,"Not only Joaquin Phoenix gives the best performance of his career at the same time he carries The Legacy of Heath Ledger's iconic Joker. And also Todd Philips gives us a film is both dark,twisted,hilarious and one of the best film of this year (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)."
3132,"Joaquin pheonix's performance is out of this world, the joker is a perfect story of a man driven to madness by society, defenantly the best movie of 2019"
3133,He does an IGGY POP impression in the first few scenes .. completely imitates IGGY ... boring nothing original here ... I cannot believe he won? For what ? Losing weight ? It's bad !
3134,The thought of somebody destroying my favorite villain to create a art piece is absolutely depressing. This movie is not a DC joker movie. It's absolutely pathetic that a movie like this has the right obtain the name joker.
3135,Amazing performance by joker but the movies plot is sick
3136,"I am the kind of person who enjoys a good anti-hero now and then. But Joker took it to another level, they overly glorified violence, mental illness.
The worst part of the movie was Phoenix. He is completely unbelievable as the Joker (a supervillian, remember). He overacts the whole movie, and you just lose sympathy for the character since it is so overdone.
Overall a bad movie, keeping in the context that this is supposed to be a ""superhero"" type movie. Might be an ok art-house type movie, but the fact that they tried this with comic book characters just ruins the whole thing.
The only good part of the movie is DeNiro, he does a great job in his role. Easily stole the show for his scenes."
3137,This is a truly terrible movie where over hype and fake reviews win again. Joaquin Phoenix has a reputation for being a bit of a knob and thats basically all he does throughout the film is behave like a knob. de niro looks tired and is just going through the motions for the big pay check. another DC failure in my book. gratuitous violence without substance and not a patch on heath ledger.
3138,"Wow, the concensus here is that this film is a MASTERPIECE, but that's debatable. Where I can say that it's an ""alright"" film is about as honest as it gets. Joaquin Phoenix (while a damned fine actor) played the exact same role with the much better film ""You Were Never Really Here"" in 2017. He tends to play the same or similar character in the majority of his films. Other reviewers of ""Joker""mentions the obvious nods to ""Taxi Driver"" which I agreed with while watching this film, it was just a little too obvious. It sounds like sour grapes to mention that I thought Heath Ledger's Joker was a more fleshed out portrayal of a psychopath, but it simply was. Now with that aside, let's not forget how plain BORING this film was. After 29 minutes some action finally happens with the train scene which was good. The ending (while predictable) was pretty good as well. But between those two scenes..it was dullsville. Just watching Phoenix act oddly for the majority of the film just wasn't enough to CARRY the film on it's own. I believe the phony hype surrounding this film prompting mass shootings etc really helped the box office numbers before anyone really had a chance to see the quality of the film. I say do yourself a favor and re-watch ""You Were Never Really Here"" to watch a much better portrayal of madness from a much better Joaquin Phoenix."
3139,"You have to be patient with Todd Phillip's Joker before he delivers the requisite gore fest this god of sadistic comedy requires. It is carried along most of the way by the outstanding performance of Joaquin Phoenix and a lax system and gullible society unable to put the obvious together that allows the morose Arthur Fleck to wreak havoc in plain sight.Nothing could live up to the film's hype and outside of Phoenix's stirring but admittedly overlong performance ( a little too many yoga poses) the film depends heavily on nostalgia (music, era, Scosese) to propel its meagre satiric moments. As far as the character, Peck is classic cliche loner, Travis Bickle as Paglacci hanging around his old haunts.Like all hateful Jokers, Arthur is imbued with the ability to take an incredible beating as he does here before rising from the ashes in Todd's apocalyptic uptown climax that is more nonsensical than parable.Featuring a performance for the ages Joker ultimately is a smug gratuitously violent slasher, its unintentionally comic moments watching the heavy handed Phillips maintain PC order amid all the chaos."
3140,"Throughout history we have always replaced characters in our culture. Pan the god of nature in paganism was translated into the devil in Roman Catholicism in order to bring social coherence. At the moment, there is no other figure in pop culture to represent the Devil and his meticulous maniacal ways like the Joker. Unfortunately, in this film that has been forgotten.It hurts me to say, as Joaquin Phoenix is one of my favorite actors but he broke the golden rule laid out by Robert Downey Jr's character in Tropic Thunder- ""Never go full........!"" There was no moment that I felt in awe with the characters meticulous planning, cunning, and depth to speak to the chaotic narcissism within us all. This was all excellently depicted by Heath Ledger's eternal performance in the opening scene of The Dark Knight.I was waiting for that Keyser Souse moment when Phoenix's joker would take control and display a black mirror to the audience that he had been pulling the strings all along. This never came. Instead, he was a sorrowful victim of society that simply threw a tantrum and lost control, instead of being empowered, taking control and becoming the anarchistic social commentator we all know the Joker to be in the comics and films.Forest Gump, The Rain Man, Mr Robot. These are all excellent depictions of people suffering mental health issues. The writers and actors remembered to always represent these characters with a level of ingenuity that leaves the audience in awe and a better understanding to their different cognitive approach to society. This was sadly forgotten by Phillips and Phoenix, as all that was displayed was a victim of the cruel fist of society. These people who have been banished are so much more, and for that I felt the performance to be a vulgar insult.I have been a true fan of the narrative of Batman and the Joker, and the intriguing dualistic narrative displayed over decades. However, if they were to meet in this universe for a much needed sequel to represent Joker's crime lord life, it would have to be a grudge match between Christian Bale's The Machinist and Phoenix's malnutritioned Clown Prince of Crime. The Fact of the matter is that this performance was never threatening.I will forever love Joaquim Phoenix as an actor as he gave me my favorite film 'Her' but I felt that the mark was sorely missed here. I will rewatch the film hoping that I missed something. However, the film was nothing more than it's extended trailer. I was not exposed to intriguing revelations, nor was I challenged on the ideas it presented. Basically, if it is nothing more than it's trailer it is not a good film.The reviews I have read are full of superlatives and explanations, adorning the film without saying why! I hope that Heath Ledger's incredible performance will not be over shadowed by an Oscar win for Joaquin Phoenix as that would mean that the Joker will truly be forgotten."
3141,"I don't think there was a need for a super dark film tbh, this is a DC comics character that has been dramatized in an effort to top Dark Knight. Unfortunately, it was not captivating. There was no inspiration, and it just made me feeling what was that. We see that stuff enough in the real world...."
3142,Truly says a lot about our society as a whole 10/10 best film
3143,"Really a masterpiece, not only because it's from dc universe and we're so familiar with the character of joker, but also because we can relate to it. It is a dark film. Joaquin phoenix really did an amazing job and did the character justice, i would even go on to say that he will possibly win the oscars for the phenomenal job he has done in this movie, really worth a watch."
3144,I can say that Phoenix is master actor. Bt this does still not make a great movie. And thsi movie lives from blabla in every medium.This has nothing to do with the joker and the only thing behind is to make money with bad and good media. Todd Philips should maybe read some comics and don;t copy movies like taxi driver or similar.
3145,"This whole film makes no sense, it's, apperently, completely overhyped.
I went to the theatre without any expectations, prejudice, etc. but man, what a bunch of...
This is my first review on IMDB, I had to join, seeing this film was rated a 9.0"
3146,Why do they need to change a character that we already loved very much?
3147,"This film could be titled ""my little pony"" for all i know. I ser no resemblanse to the DC character called Joker. It is a travesty."
3148,Extremely depressive and boring movie that is only accidentally in DC universe. This kind of doom and gloom was seen only in Melancholia from Lars von Trier.
3149,What a waste of time the only real Joker was Heath Ledger this clown and I do mean clown doesn't even come close the movie itself is just macabre
3150,"First off, the phase of this movie is way to slow and feels even longer than it is.
I bored myself to dead and I didn't know what to think of it!!! This is a understatement!!!Just A waste of money and time. I can't understand how it gets high ratings like this.
The trailer looked promising and that is all I can say.Don't waste your time and money on masterpiece of boredom!"
3151,"This is a cult to psychopathic schizophrenia. The movie has a very poor argument. You can summarize the movie in 30 seconds.
Weird, simple acting made great by ignorant people."
3152,"Call this movie ""the story of A. Fleck"" instead of ""Joker"" and you'll get a story of a mind disabled guy dismissed by the society which will not be concerned to nobody (either the character nor the movie)."
3153,"S---L---O---W..., boring, way too predictable -- no idea why so many folks raved about this and gave it such high ratings. To be fair, the acting was excellent. But that can't save a terrible plot. Don't let the inexplicable popularity fool you, this is not worth watching. No one in my family enjoyed it, and there are 5 of us with varying ages and tastes."
3154,This movie drags and takes to long to make a point. I was waiting for the point for him to start his descent into madness which didn't occur till around the 30 min mark. This movie is way too long.
3155,"New generation! Berate me about what is funny. Is not-being-able-to-make-funny, funny? Is cringe comedy (bspw: Borat) really funny enough? Blend it with some pseudo-arthouse sequences and ta-da you have the movie Joker.Normally; mentally challenged manchilds' stories are not favored by Hollywood too much, however this movie is an exception of this category. Joaquin Phoenix really succeeded to act as a mentally challenged character. I'm saying it because it says so in the movie. I advise that the Academy Award would be given to him. I mean, aren't the new generation dumb enough to know the difference between Joker and Taxi Driver? Travis Scott ia also troubled but smart nonetheless.The ""HAH HAAH HAAAH HAAAAH HAAAAAH HAAAAAAH HAAAAAAAH!"" laugh was used too much. Those would be peak points but if it's used in half of the sccenes, it would lose effect and starts to become boring. I cringed a lot in this movie, on how cheaply they tried to express an idea. Look at the girlfriend character of Joker! She was added because Joker wouldn't look like a loser. One can't manage to get the point.Also, they squeezed in Batman character unnecessarily in a boring way. That's why I'm giving 4/10, not 5/10."
3156,"JOKER is uneven, unfocused, and trying so say so many different things that it ends up saying nothing at all...and that's the point. Except, the thing is, I don't believe for a second that director Todd Phillips is capable of pulling that off on purpose. This movie totally feels like a stoner comedy director trying to remake Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy; it completely lacks any unique artistic flare, but at least the flare it's ripping off is great. I believe the film's accidental success is thanks to editor Jeff Groth creating a solid movie out of a mess.If your personal movie database is made up of only popular movies or no movies made before the late 90s, Joker will feel like a masterpiece; however, if you're a cinema connoisseur, the movie will range between pretty good & meh. It's entertaining and you won't have wasted your time seeing it. You may not exactly enjoy yourself during the first half of the movie, but it all pays off eventually. You absolutely will leave the movie satisfied.This movie does successfully accomplish what all great movies should: you will have a lot to think about when it ends. It'll take time before you decide whether you liked it or not.Viewing the film strictly as its own movie, it's mostly pretty good. It's a great character study of what can turn a man into a psychopath...though it's nothing new, but at least it does it well.As a comic book movie, however, it's a complete & utter travesty that wipes its ass with the legacy of one of the most iconic characters in history...except for the saving grace of it final couple minutes before the credits role, that the average movie goer, unfortunately, simply will not understand.Phoenix's performance in this movie will become a thing of legend. Theater schools will study his acting for decades. He'll be nominated for all the awards (of course, in a year where most of the oscar buzz is revolving around Adam Sandler...yes, really!) Phoenix is absolutely mesmerizing and even if you hate the movie, you'll want to be able to tell your grandchildren that you saw this performance in theaters. It's right there next to DeNiro's Travis Bickle (from the movie this one is trying to be).Of course, like all hack directors, only the lead character has an arc, while everyone else is completely one-dimensional; which is a shame, since it's a cast of incredible actors.All-in-all, this is another case of one of history's all-time greatest performances wasted in an entertaining, but forgettable movie."
3157,"Snore fest, bore fest. Please can I have the 2.5 hours of my life back."
3158,"I expected really good stuff, waitin for dealer 2 hours and for the record its cold here. take the weed come to home, change the vpn order some good pizza wait for 40 minute( there was a busy day) pizza delivered, lit a weed start the movie, getting high ."
3159,"This is the most boring movie i have ever seen in my whole life.
How can people give this crap such a high rating, people who gives this movie a 10 must be mental crazy by themself!"
3160,"I don't get it. What's all the hype about?
I watched it last night and to me it was just another average movie, nothing more. I even felt like at times it was too slow and it was getting kind of boring."
3161,"Great performance and music, but the scenario is way bellow expectations. There is no character development, just isn't complex enough and dialogues are kind of superficial, especially for a Joker.
Should have waited for it on Netflix."
3162,"Well, that was thoroughly mediocre.Keep in mind, I didn't say ""terrible."" It's not one of the worst films of the year. Hell, it's not even the worst comic book film of the year (Hellboy and Polar are fighting it out for that title) It's not ""good"" though either.Most of that falls on the script. It's so worked up in telling you how important it is that it forgets to even tell you why. There are a LOT of expository scenes here, and while the actors do a shocking job selling them (Every single performance in the film is outstanding), their acting can't make up for how heavy handed they get. The closest thing the film has to an ideology is this really juvenile South Park thing of ""Both sides are equally bad, but at least the Right Wing aren't pussies!"" Even worse though, because this film is begging to be taken 100% seriously all the time outside of about a handful of scenes (Which are the best stuff in the movie. Seriously, if most of the film had that tone, it would be a masterpiece.) If this was going for a satirical or campy route, it might have worked, but it just doesn't. Don't even get me started on that insanely manipulative musical score. At least it's not pro-incel like I thought it was gonna be.On top of all that, the film doesn't even pretend to care about the source material. This was very clearly an anti-Occupy art thing that was forced into being a Joker film at the last second. A name change here, an Easter Egg there.Like I said though, it's not terrible. Joaquin Phoenix is dynamite here and I really do hope that he gets that Oscar. He managed to generate sympathy for me from a character I was absolutely positive would never get any from me. I'd even argue that de Niro deserves a Best Supporting nomination here, this is the best performance he's given in decades and he gives even Phoenix a run for his money.The cinematography is gorgeous as well. It definitely nails the aesthetic of a grimy 70s crime thriller and there really isn't any comic book film out there that I can say matches this film's aesthetic outside of maybe Watchmen. Pretty much every shot in this film would make a gorgeous screensaver.While Joker certainly isn't the worst thing ever, it's still plagued by shortcomings. I can see both arguments for how it's a terrible and amazing film. For me, it was a whimper when it should have been a bang and that falls entirely on the shoulders of screenwriter Todd Phillips."
3163,This movie was so boring. Also it was so over hyped and pretentious and self mastabutory. There were some good bits in the 3rd act but overall a disappointment. The music was good though.
3164,"The performance of Phoenix's was astonishing, he nails both characters of the Joker and as Arthur.The amount of time and focus both during the movie production and prior can clearly be seen in Phoenix's performance. This is definitely one of Phoenix's best performances and is highly worth of an Oscar nomination!Todd's directing highly deserves his share of the praise for this movie! The make-up and costume design was too excellent."
3165,"This is a movie that I want to forget.
The most disgusting and psychopathic movie I have ever watched.... :["
3166,"What kind of Joker is this? The kind that cries on the inside.This is a Gotham Horror. Director and co-writer Todd Phillips has gone through Martin Scorsese's filmography ranging from Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy, Bringing Out the Dead to Shutter Island. Robert De Niro appears as a chat show host just to drive home the Scorsese connections.The Joker delivers a bravura performance from Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck. He is one of life's losers. Unable to hold down a job as a clown and on seven different kinds of medications but he is still a manic depressive.Set in the early 1980s, Gotham City is in the sewers and there are sightings of giant rats. Social services funding cuts means that Fleck is on his own. The social worker who does not even listen to him is not going to be there for him any more.Like Travis Bickle, Fleck snaps and is then reborn as the Joker. The Joker is not political but this nihilistic slow burn drama takes aim at wealthy Democrat and Republican politicians alike.Thomas Wayne might not be painted as a Trump, but he is a rich tycoon who thinks the 'have nots' are clowns. Watch out for the scene when the moguls dressed in tuxedos are watching a screening of Chaplin's Modern Times. A movie that commented on the desperate conditions many people faced during the 1930s Depression.Joker is a bold comic strip adaptation but it is a low wattage film with no plot. It is a tribute act because of the Scorsese movies that inspired it."
3167,Crap worse film ever and I don't understand why people would pay to watch this i would rather watch Barbie girl then that rubbish
3168,To boring movie . Wastage of money and tym. All public make hike
3169,"I've read some respected film critics refer to this as a powerful character study of a person with a mental illness, or an illustration of how damaged loners can be dangerous to themselves and others if they're left untreated by society. Maybe this is how they read the movie from their educated, middle-class standpoint. Maybe millions of film-goers will think the same. If so, then (once again) I have good cause to worry about the impact this kind of film can have on society's perception of people with mental health problems. Goodness knows, it's bad enough already. So bad that people are being driven further and further into themselves, fearful of saying too much in case of the repercussions: stigmatisation, prejudice, bullying. One thing the film does get right, actually, is that society doesn't seem to care about such people. Unfortunately, content like this will probably make society care even less.Great acting and cinematography. They're about the only good things I've got to say. Otherwise, it's a poor rehash of stuff that's already been done before and much better. And its exploitation of mental illness and misrepresentation of pathologies are unforgiveable."
3170,"Great job acting from Joaquin Phoenix if his job was to do the origin story for Buffalo Bill from The silence of the lambs. This is the most limp-wristed feminine non masculine joker I've ever seen. If this was not called The joker movie it would not have been that bad but just a horrible ""joker"" movie sorry but I think people are liking this just to not feel bad about the money they spent to watch it"
3171,"Are you depressd, do you love hurting people ?
Do you enjoy other people getting tortured? Do you feel you are mentally I'll?
Do you enjoy blaming others what ever the reason?
Or you just want to get depressed ?
Or lets say you dont know how to waste your 2 hours !!!
For those who loved the psychologically mental film , admit yourself asap to a mental hospital!!"
3172,"Truly didn't enjoy it at all, test the acting Joaquin is superb deserves easily 100/10 and all the trophies in the World and every element in this movie is wonderful from soundtrack to photography to directing but what brings everything down is the story that really makes you ask about the purpose of the whole movie and why all those efforts to be vanished in the air because you want to build a whole perfect project with the worst basic foundation."
3173,"Sorry, I watched this movie and it was very dark and so slow. It was more about how someone mistreated can become a psychopath than it was about the Joker. Not at all like Gotham or even earlier Batman movies. Sure, Joaquin did a good job of acting, but the movie was a drag and unless you really get off on watching nut jobs it was certainly not entertaining. Hollywood loved it because they like blood, guts, and sick people. Besides, there are so many terrible movies coming out of Hollywood, even a mediocre movie gets a 4-star rating because the others are just so bad. In this movie, there were some parts that were soooo slow I used 2x just to move things along. It helped. Could not wait for it to end. This is a dreary movie and not entertainment. Hollywood movies just get sicker and they like it."
3174,"Todd Phillips wrote and directed this travesty, this study of insanity that's somehow an origin story for the Joker villain. This was just a poor adaptation already in need of a reboot. Joaquin P was exemplary in his portrayal of the material given him, it was just poor material. This is born out in the fact that the ""Joker 2"" sequel is NOT written by Todd or co-writer Scott Silver. In any case, the first 90-mins should've been edited to 30-mins - way too much useless filler. The final 30-mins is where the action is at but it's really a portrayal of a criminally diminished mental capacitant than of a masterful arch-villain. This particular Joker character is a mentally and emotionally stunted unfortunate who has no capacity, no potential to become ""The Joker"" criminal mastermind we have all come to admire as a key foil to Batman. This was a wasted effort and should be archived a mile underground."
3175,"I kept hearing how great this movie was and I wanted to have an opinion for myself. I'm not the biggest Joaquin Phoenix fan but I was willing to give it a shot.
I had my doubts just watching the trailer but I kept an open mind.I seriously had to pause this movie 4 times and take a break. It is so boring and I've sat through some slow movies and enjoyed them but this was just dull!! I could relate to his story and getting beat down so many times that he finally snapped. I found myself rooting for him at times. But was still very bored!!! I would never torture myself by watching this movie again. I don't understand why people are giving it such a high rating. Obviously I'm missing the bigger picture but I'm completely fine with that as long as I don't have to watch again."
3176,"I honestly don't get why so many people are in love with this movie. some even consider it the best movie they've ever seen (which could be their personal opinion) or the best movie that ever existed(?)I don't understand the general ""amazing best movie ever wow!"" shield this film formed around itself. People are obsessed with teaching people that violence is not the way. and when arthur resorts to violence after getting discriminated (killing 3 people on the subway) somehow he's an icon and idol. (not that I'm saying it's wrong. it's just contradictory)I spent a rough 25TL to watch this movie 3 days after release because of how people told me that it's a must see or it's the best movie ever. hell it even appeared in our english exam.
but after seeing how stale it was it just felt like a waste. there wasn't even any real message to get out of it. maybe ""if you discriminate a man on the subway with a laughing disorder you'll get shot in the head"" or ""if you get discriminated in the subway shoot em in the head"". other than that it didnt really do much except maybe exploring the faults of society which I think more than half the population is aware of.Overall It's not a bad movie. I'd rate it below 5 otherwise. but it's really not the 10 stars people keep giving."
3177,"I knew going into the movie that it wasn't a superhero movie and I was fine with that. I wasn't expecting explosions or action. But I was expecting something more than just watching Phoenix laugh and dance for an hour. I could simply say it was slow, but that doesn't say enough. It was boring! I admit, Drama isn't my favorite genre, but I still expect more than just staring at people with no dialog. The ""twists"" were not anything big or anything a normal person couldn't see coming. Really I don't think the story fits with my imagination of who the Joker is, but that's fine. Phoenix did a great job! But this could have easily been just a movie where Phoenix showcases his talent without him becoming the Joker. I wonder if the reviews would be the same if it was just titled ""Laughing Man""..."
3178,"Okay, when I first heard that there was going to be a Joker origin story film I just didn't want anything to do with it. I just feel as though with his ideology in the comics, the cartoon, The Dark Knight movie and other stuff that less is more to explain why he is the way he is. Then the first trailer hit and my expectations changed again, it changed them from ""kind of meh"" to completely sold on the idea. So I sat down and watched it and... it's GOOD but things get a bit complicated.I'll skip over the plot because I'd like to summarize the benefits and disadvantages this has as a film rather than go over the plot to a movie you've either seen or want to see (I mean I assume that's why readers are here). I'll start with the compliments - Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck is a good and nuanced performance with the steady deterioration from mentally ill but harmless guy that wants to make people laugh, take care of his mother and make ends meet to a psychopathic killing machine is well done, and to address the controversy - I really struggle to see how anyone can interpret this as anything other than sympathetic villain, as in you can see why he does what he does but you don't agree with it.I'd also say the acting from the other main players, the cinematography, the way it flawlessly blends fantasy in with reality so any 2 people can walk out of this with different opinions of what actually happens in this movie all works well as is the rather nihilistic nature of the plot - where things escalate over essentially nothing does fit in with the idea that this is an origin story to a villain that does horrible things because he thinks it's funny.So what are my problems? Well I don't think they got the character of The Joker down for one thing - Arthur Fleck slips in and out of fantasy stuff like dates and appearances on his favourite comedy show. I'm going to say it - The Joker's blend of crazy ISN'T the failure to distinguish between fantasy and reality - it's that his ideology is so warped that all the murder, mayhem and violence - he thinks the pain he causes has a funny side to all of it. He also creates complex and intricate plans to all of this - he is essentially as smart or smarter than Batman, a self proclaimed ""World's Greatest Detective"" but also his opposite. Arthur Fleck seems more like a character The Joker of other media would use(for his plan), chew up and spit out like he frequently does with Harley Quinn.Well I don't think the whole ""That's not The Joker"" is a bad thing, just when you call your movie Joker - it really needs to be said. My other complaint is a very simple one - this story does have themes in it. Mental illness, not treating it properly from the government, income inequality, failed dreams, failed job prospects, failed dating prospects, horrible blood relatives and does absolutely nothing with it. The final scene cuts back to Fleck in a mental hospital - meaning it's big statement on this is ""These exist, do with that information what you will"". Even in media that tries the ""all is for nothing"" stuff whatever it starts bringing up as themes it usually follows through, this doesn't.I do want to stress that I did enjoy this movie - I just feel as though the idea might not have been there to begin with and people seem to overlook the elements within the film that really aren't as strong - at least not strong enough to be considered #10 on the ""Best movies of all time"" list."
3179,"He is pursuing a career in comedy that he has little talent for. He is being beaten and ridiculed. Standard stuff.
He supposedly laughs uncontrollably due to a condition but later refutes it. Joker's menacing laugh is a big part of the character, this should not be made to be out of his control.
He commits one crime on impulse which for some reason becomes a catalyst for a clown mob movement that later become his followers.
It's accidental not earned. He is mostly self loathing and his final Joker iteration to me felt pathetic.
This is not the Joker origin we deserve.(Also worst batman origin, that kid Bruce was expressionless)"
3180,"People criticising this film for being 'dark and disturbing' is purely hypocritical, in my opinion. When you're making a film about the world's most twisted mind, the end result is bound to be dark and disturbing. If not, then the movie clearly hasn't captured what it means to be turned into the Joker. It doesn't matter whether this film has derived inspiration from a few previous films or any other source for that matter; by itself, this film is unique, classy and a sheer masterpiece."
3181,"Once you leave the theatre, you will absolutely feel it was yi=our money's worth. This cannot be said to be just a movie. It has elements to it that can be seen in our society even today. How a person with mental illness is laughed by the society even if there is nothing he can do about it, and also about the divide between the poor and the rich. The directing was simply brilliant and captured the darkness of the mind of the joker, The stroy even if it may be at slow at first will get better as the movie goes on. The story is dark but at the same time has scenes with comedy in it. It also has shocking bits to it which makes it an absolutely brilliant movie. The Acting was also amazing. The movie absolutely lived up to its hype. Watch it if you can!"
3182,"I love the DC universe, and it's a shame that this movie got added to it, I'm really having a hard time understanding how anyone could possibly like this movie."
3183,There are about 20 minutes of this film that could be salvaged. Otherwise it is endless drawn out scenes of atmospheric monotony. Would have been a great sleep aid if the score wasn't so great.
3184,Joker has always been the centre of attraction and jaquine has definatley put his best
3185,"What? every criminal every wrongdoer has his excuse which he uses as his defending reason for all the ghastly act that he may commit. and there are people to spread his good word & work? Hope it doesnt get any worse than this, and calling this a masterpiece, should get the head examined. Maniacal acting, not one shining moment. Waste of good time.the one star is for the title THE END."
3186,"I respect the acting and I like that it really brings awareness of mental illness, what millions of people are dealing with all the time. But for an entertainment movie i found it so incredibly slow. I was always waiting for something to happen and it never happened."
3187,"This glorious presentation of a supervillain is disturbing. The acting & cynemotography is legendary but the story is troubling . I fear this movie will be indirectly responsible for many real violence in future . It's not a Masterpiece of Art Its a Masterpiece of Movie Business. If you cant hate the joker character please don't sympathize. The joker is not the victim of the system, he is victim of his own hateful ego ."
3188,"It's pretty clear this film makes a lot of people believe they understand mental health more than they did before watching it. If they DO understand it better, hooray, but I suspect that for many it enhances real understanding little more than Rain Man did for Autism. Rather anecdotally and surface.
So, in my view, another opportunity missed.
But what really disappointed me was Phoenix. He was amazing in Gladiator, and probably did a better illumination of mental health in that.
I was looking at my watch from 40' into Joker, and pretty much every 20' from there. Just didn't do it for me, sorry."
3189,"If nothing else, I appreciate what Joker stands for in the context of a Hollywood comic-book movie. I like the idea that a filmmaker in the MCU era can take one of the most popular characters in fandom, strip that character to their basic roots, and reinvent them for a new genre. I know the ""gritty reboot"" aesthetic is basically a joke now (hell, there's an entire YouTube channel dedicated to parodying it), but ""Taxi Driver starring the Joker with sprinklings of The King of Comedy"" isn't the worst movie pitch I've heard. Granted, even in the most unforgiving circles of fans, the Joker has more leniency in adaptation changes because there is no set backstory for the mysterious clown.At a glance, the film is agreeable enough. The seventies were one of the most visually rich times for cinema (yes, I know it takes place in '81) so the film, which prides itself on being inspired by that era of film, has a great attention to detail. It's always refreshing to see a superhero movie not set against the backdrop of a larger universe(or so we're told), and even though I would have been more excited if DiCaprio stayed on board (he would have been PERFECT), Joaquin Phoenix is a equally gifted and interesting actor worthy of taking up the mantle.The appeal of the movie, both from what I got and why it's been such a success, is the throwback style. I love looking at this film. The lighting alternates between elegant and grungy, and the camera compositions are lovingly set-up. But the costume design, including a refreshing centerpiece costume not making use of the iconic green and purple color scheme, must not be overlooked, as well as an amazing soundtrack (score AND soundtrack).But despite, or perhaps because of, the obvious technical competence on the stage, it never quite comes together. The film often falls victim to the bits where the film has to stop being it's own thing and has to remind us why we know who the Joker is at all, as if being a prequel was the only reason to justify its existence. At first it's handled well with the presence of Thomas Wayne, which is actually surprisingly clever, but an extended sequence featuring one of the most recognizable voices of the whole franchise tips it over.I actually think I enjoyed the film more when I saw it at a digital screening at a Marcus theater instead of the 35 mm screenings now playing at select indie theaters, probably because it made the film seem less pretentious. Watching it at the Oriental made it seem like a gritty, Taxi Driver riff that never fully gets off the ground, but the digital screening makes it seem like a good example of a mainstream superhero movie.Also, I know I'll get some flack for bringing this up, but elements of Joker's marketing build-up ended up seeping into how I interpreted the film, but not in the way you might expect. The week before it came out, director Todd Phillips (The Hangover trilogy, Due Date, War Dogs) gave an interview in which he blamed ""woke culture"" (sigh) on why he stopped making comedy movies. Now that's not a line of thinking I agree with, but on a more personal level, it's not a community I feel particularly welcome in. And later in the film when the Joker goes on a talk show (no spoilers) and rants that ""...the system...decide(s) what's right or wrong the same way that you decide what's funny or not"", it was impossible not to think of Phillips comments and roll my eyes.Joker is well-made and endlessly interesting, but notably imperfect. The thing I like most about it that it opens the door for more unconventional comic book movies. Hopefully one that succeeds in being truly subversive."
3190,"This movie is related to every single person on this planet. Because at some point of our lives, we at least once ever felt alone, lonely, unwanted, neglected. Maybe not as extreme and painful as Joker experience.
Joaquin successfully brought up the atmosphere and vibes and feeling that Joker felt, he delivered it well so we could get it, relate to it.
The cinematography is awesome, with the lighting and shooting angle, we're brought in there. The music has the right vibes and placement throughout the movie.Joker is that type of movie that you need to watch, a true masterpiece that u can't miss."
3191,"I don't see how this version of the joker could be anybody's nemesis. He's too mad to organise anything. I get how he became a symbol, but going forward he's not causing much trouble, not for Batman anyway."
3192,"This deviates from the traditional DC movies, with a much darker and realistic direction.It's not just the Joker, but the story of a character and his tribulations through a somewhat corrupted and malicious society.The ending was great. Not to detract from Heath Ledger or Jack Nicholson they each had their own style, however Joaquin makes him the most likeable and down to earth Joker to date."
3193,Don't let all the high praise and 10 star reviews fool you. This is an average movie at best. Anyone who watches this and thinks it's a masterpiece has no concept of what superb writing and cinematography are.
3194,"Sorry, but this doesn't do it for me. Phoenix gets accolades for basically being able to laugh incessantly, and he lost a great amount of weight. How many times is it now that an actor has received acclaim for losing or gaining weight for a role, seriously... oh, and he smokes for the role too. Lol Well, it won't be long before the next Joker movie, gonna have to take it up another notch Hollywood... whatever."
3195,"The trailer of the movie was really very good and attractive! The people's reviews also made me madly curious about the movie
When I watched the movie i found good things but these don't include the story
The movie is boring in general, I just can't find why people got crazy about it"
3196,"This movie perfectly encapsulates every feeling I have experienced in my entire life and made it all worth it. This picture is white people's ""Black Panther"", and men's ""The Notebook"". If you don't fall into both of these categories you probably will not understand the beautiful essence of this movie. This is not merely a movie, it's a message, it's a mirror to society and its a masterpiece. It is unfair to only give this a 10/10 rating because it should not be limited to a numerical confinement. Anyone who does not love this movie has not understood it. What we see in this movie is a cruel assault on Arthur by everyone around him. Society chews him up, completely ignoring what makes him different, and he is left with no choice but to force people to acknowledge his illness. If you think this movie might not be for you then you're right."
3197,I saw this movie and was unable to understand what was so special about this movie. Except acting of one actor nothing was so special. Rather movie was depressing and at certain times was irritating. Hats off to people who have made this movie a hype and hit. I am sure when hype will be over the rating will go down
3198,The acting was good but the film was boring for the most part. Many plot holes and little to no character development. This joker is stupid and no way could be the criminal mastermind that joker is supposed to be. Extremely overhyped and Overrated Movie.
3199,"Despite supreme acting the movie itself is not very entertaining, which leaves those of us who don't find the joker as a particularly interesting character disenchanted in a boring and dull Gotham as a mere background.I wish the clown was at least funny. Go Batman!"
3200,Nice experience at the cinema. Interesting ideas presented. Stars for the amazing performance by Mr. Phoenix. Mostly it felt too depressing and downright anxiety inducing.
3201,"The movie is more about society and about the victims of this society rather than about one single person and his cruelty. And the oppressors are the state institutions which don't care about unwealthy, unhealthy and alone citizens and just call them ""clowns"" following the rules of the jungles. As a result, those ""clowns"" raised against the system and started to talk to it in its language, the language of violence and power. The great work of the actor and the director gave me an impression as if I have read the masterpieces of G. Orwell and F. Kafka."
3202,"How this movie was slammed by professional critics? Beats me.It is one of the greatest masterpieces of all time.Normally I do not like slow paced movies. But Mr Phoenix carries this movie from start to finish. Assisted by a storyline that offers an alternate view of how the joker became the antisocial madman.
If I had to pick between this one or Heath Ledger's joker..... I just can't.But if I had to pick between The Dark Knight or Joker... Joker all the way.Everything just fits perfectly together."
3203,"Let me start off by saying that this is not a badly made movie. It has clever writing, deep themes, and I admire the work of director, Todd Phillips.But I hated this movie. And trust me, I didn't want to hate it. I went into the cinema off the back of hearing all the positive reviews and the ""8 minute standing ovation"" from the Venice Film Festival (I think that's where it was, I'll have to double check). So yes, you could say I went in with high expectations.This movie just wasn't for me. Not because of its violence and gore; although that one scene where the protagonist's co-worker is left terrified after witnessing a brutal murder and can't reach the door had my audience laughing, which was somewhat disturbing to me.But what was truly disturbing was the journey of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) - his descent into a mentally ill loner to a caricature of the Joker - which left me in a constant state of discomfort and nausea from start to finish.Yes, Joaquin's acting was good. He was able to make me feel sympathy for the character from his first scene - making it all the more unsettling when he becomes the Joker and commits horrific acts of violence in the movie.But when you look beyond this, the moving is extremely uneventful. I don't mind that it doesn't have a huge action set piece, but if I wasn't uncomfortable from start to finish I would instead been simply bored .This is not the best movie of 2019 in my opinion. Granted, it's not as bad as 'Charlie's Angels', but I still found it to long slog; one which I will likely never watch again.I'll reiterate that I really didn't want to hate this movie. Even in this review I don't want all over this movie because I know that people really love it, and that is GREAT!But it just wasn't for me.Overrated, uneventful, and deeply disturbing."
3204,"Yes! Joker had me on the edge of my seat through the entire movie. Everything felt just right... or maybe just wrong? The intense music through the entire movie, Phoenix as disturbed as can be: you will be sucked in and in some weird way start rooting for the joker. Go see it. Now."
3205,Beautifully lit. But my god was it boring as hell.
3206,Starts very slowly and only picks up in the last 20 mins or so. Joaquin phoenix is excellent but the rest of this is very average.
3207,"To me it is just a cinematic masterpiece. The visual effects, music and camera work are all insane. Along with Jaoquins acting it's a 10/10. So many iconic scenes that are even breathtaking on the third time round"
3208,"The gritty, dirty 1980's cityscapes are very well done. J. Phoenix plays the part very well, but the movie and it's plot just aren't anything special. Meh."
3209,"So in a world full of horrible horrible superhero movies that are in nonstop production, this is refreshing, but this is not a superhero movie. For that matter this is not a super villain movie either. There is no batman, no superhero to be seen. Truthfully the movie feels like king of comedy mashed with a little taxi driver (admitted by phillips), with just a bit of v for vendetta, and seven thrown in. In that sense it is good and worth watching. It is dark, very twisted, and very deserving of its R rating. However, (and lets preface with what's to follow with I am not into superheros or comic books) this is not the origin story of a super genius arch enemy of batman. This guy can't read or write, there is no talent for chemistry to be seen, he seems mediocre in every sense other than he is a true psychopath. If this was about a guy who thought he was the joker from batman I would have probably applauded it, but as a super villain origin story I just don't buy it. Final thoughts on Phoenix's performance very convincing, very well done. So good movie on its own as a movie, but not a good origin story for a super villain (which affects its score)."
3210,"It was a chore for me. I thought I would enjoy every minute of it. I barely enjoyed any of it. Not a film I'd watch again. Even if it was on TV and I was bored and only had that channel to watch, I would rather shave my nuts with a piranha."
3211,"I loved it. Despite all of the violence, Joaquin did an amazing job. My favourite scene was of him dancing as he is coming down the stairs. The backgroud music sets it off so nicely. He looks like he's the happiest he had ever been in his life or at the point where his insanity has finally kicked into high gear. Either way it is the ultimate expression of the mindset of Joker. Brilliant. He deserves to win Best Actor."
3212,"Phenomenal. Phoenix is just a perfect Joker, both as a mentally disturbed Arthur and as an unpredictable and psychopatic Joker. Robert De Niro gives one of his most memorable performances. The music and cinematography is beautiful. I don't want to spoil the movie, so i won't talk about the ending, but it's mindblowing. If Phoenix doesn't win an oscar for this i'll never trust them again. (Just joking.)"
3213,"Fantastic In every way. This film is a true character study, really showing us the dark side of the human mind. Not an action fest like most 'superhero' films."
3214,"As cliche as it sounds, words cannot describe how good this movie is. I am still unsure how any one can see it as anything less than perfect. every scene is perfectly choreographed and the acting is astounding. I simply cannot stress enough how quality this movie is. If you're looking for a thought-provoking piece of entertainment, you need not look any further"
3215,"I thought I was going to find this movie to be a bit too weird, but I actually liked it. It was very intriguing throughout, even though it was a dark movie. I like how the how the character of the joker is portrayed, although I found the dancing to be a bit weird. One downside of the movie and I'll try not to spoil the movie as much as I can, but how is it possible that anyone can bring a gun into a TV studio? Other than that, this is a great drama movie and probably up there with the best. I see some users giving this a low rating; I assume they were expecting this to be action-packed or they can't handle the dark tone of the movie."
3216,"Basically movie of the decade , Either that you agree or not."
3217,This movie was amazing. I watched it twice and will probably watch more. This should definitely win a Oscar. Joaquin Phoenix was brilliant in this film. Definitely one of my favorite movies of all time.
3218,"Masterpiece, remember taxi drive, the best superhero movie in history"
3219,"Every time I hear the name ""Joker"" I think of a Villainous Clown-Prince-of-Crime who's crazy and the most popular villain in a comic, but Joker in a movie is something interesting we all want to see, thanks to our favorite Joker in Cinema ""Heath Ledger"" (Rest-In-Peace😔🙏) we all loved Joker after his Amazing performance, we loved it so much that we even wanted to see more of Joker in Cinema and we got it in 2016 but it completely failed and it brought frowns to our faces, after that we lost hope to the great villainous clown.When ""Joker"" was announced and a trailer has released we all started have smiles in our faces and rewatched the trailer over and over again and that we haven't seen the true story of Joker and now finally the film...it was TREMENDOUSLY MAGNIFICENT, I was really into this movie and when I left the movie theater Heck I think when everyone left the movie theater we were all like 😧 like what the heck just happened we were all confused on what's real and what's not? Did it happened or was it all in his head? And alright I will tell you my favorite thoughts on this crazy film is that...this film was there to send us a message and to show us how society is like these days and how a mess can it be and that I can make someone crazy that can lead it to complete chaos, (🚨SPOILER WARNING🚨) it tells a story about a Failed-Stand Up-Comedian ""Arthur Fleck"" who has a condition of uncontrollable Laughter called ""Pseudobulbar Affect"" or for short ""PBA"" which does not help with his health of course, but what really catches my attention are these few scenes 1) of course we have to include the ""Bathroom Scene"" this scene starts off after he kills those 3 Wall Street guys who works with Thomas Wayne which is the (The Rich) he starts running and stops at a public bathroom as he breathes uncontrollably fainting for his breath to comeback, he is frighten of this new feeling he experienced something he never thought will come then he starts dancing showing his emotion and what he felt of a new him, a new person sending chills to our spine viewing this
2) this is one of my favorite scene of the movie ""The Stairs"" is kinda cool seeing Arthur dancing happily it's like dancing like he doing a New Year New Me thing and that's what it is, he started dancing cause of course he feels powerful but he loves it, he's like free from something he's free from his pain and suffering and he'd never felt so good in his life and what really amazes me is when after the Rock N' Roll Part 2 song fades it turns to like a thrilling music done by a incredible job by Hildur Guðnadóttir, the part that's get me is when he jumped an the music hit like bullet hitting your chest, this scene will be really icon in movie history3) This is my favorite scene out of the whole movie (Call Me Joker) this is when Arthur was hit by a car and was pulled out by people who's part of the clown raid that Arthur caused, this scene is heart breaking because in the rest of the movie Arthur is all alone, nobody notices him and when he dies people are just gone walk over him like he is just a piece trash that was left in society, when he woke up from the car accident he saw everyone cheering him like he is a god, of course Arthur is amazed that many people look at him as a god and when Arthur realized something and stop and stared at his feet realizing the mess he was in, the people he killed and the life he wanted! He just stopped and noticed that he started feeling amazing and then he started to smile and didn't care about what he did, he cared about smiling!!This film is a movie we haven't seen in a long time about society, mental illness, the poor, the rich and tragedy
Bad or Not you can never change my mind about this incredible movie, believe me or not this film will definitely be a classic and iconic
and of course we can't forget about Joaquin Phoenix amazing acting, if he doesn't win Beat Actor in the Oscars we will raid The Oscars and we're clown masksINFINITE/10 THE GREATEST MOST INCREDIBLE MAGNIFICENT AMAZING OUTSTANDING FILM IVE SEEN IN MY INTIRE LIFE"
3220,"Just watch it! It's an awesome movie! Great screen writing, great acting, just the best movie of 2019!"
3221,This is one of the few movies in the 2000's that are really good and I hope it changes the film industry forever
3222,"One of the best movies I've seen in my life. Great script, incredible photography, amazing performances. It has everything."
3223,"The film is very, very wonderful, because on its platform, DC is building its entire company so that there will be another part. If they do not, then I think Marvel will be the ruler of her time in the cinema."
3224,"Joaquin Phoenix is a great actor his acting in ""you were never really here "" gladiator "".etc. and now in joker is great .film cinematography is also really good. And the direction is also very good which tellls the story in a proper manner. Camera work is also very good as we see in the starting scene where joker is laying on the road with a broken cardboard . Background music is also good . That's life song ❤.film is dark if you like dark films.then it is one of the best. One thing i don't like is that not a single thing happens in the favour of ""HAPPY""."
3225,"Great for the story
Gorgeous for acting Joaquin Phoenix
Amazing for Director Todd Phillips
Wonderful for DC movie the character of Joker
i want give it 9.5 but i cant because of the short movie time two hours was not enough for the joker movie
But I give it 10/10 (:
And waiting for the second part I am very excited."
3226,"The Joker is one of the most important as well as one of the greatest villains of all time, who is notable for using evil action by always ending with a creepy smile and a crazy loud laugh. No matter if the Joker would either lose or win to accomplish his purpose, his smile is always seen with more or less satisfaction. It is also interesting to see how the Joker has no precise origin story, but it is clear he exists in several stories and how the other characters would face him. After the making of the movie War Dogs, the filmmaker Todd Philips seems interested to release a story with the Joker as the main character. Without focusing the Joker as the villain and Batman as the hero, but instead to focus only the Joker in the tragic and the dark way. As well as by using less comedic elements, which Todd Philips usually uses it in his movies. In 2019 came out Joker by Todd Philips with Joaquin Phoenix. The movie's plot: In the 80s of the dirty Gotham City, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a troubled comedian with mental issues, who has been abandoned by the society. Since he has been discarded he slowly turns into a bloody character called Joker, who would be then noticed by several people. There have been several discussions when it was announced, the filmmakers were working on the movie, which either would come out in the good or even in bad way. The result of the movie has been to surprise the audience and the critics, as several people is still talking about it. The filmmakers did take less inspirations from the comic books, as they took more inspirations from the classic movies like Taxi Driver and The French Connection. By making the story realistic, gritty, psychological and violent, to let the audience feel the emotions of the main character, while he is facing the tragedies in his road. Joaquin Phoenix was extraordinary as Arthur Fleck/Joker, a troubled, tormented and abused comedian who has mental issues and lives in difficulties to take care his mother. Since Arthur Fleck feels tired to be discarded from the society, he would slowly starts to develop his alter ego and get more attention from everyone, not anymore as Arthur Fleck but as the Joker. The camera and the lightings were specific elaborated, to let the audience feel the main character's emotions in the psychological way as well as in the physical way, in every camera movements and in every angle shots. Especially at the moments where the main character would often laugh in the loudest way, which does represents his melancholy as he cannot mourn, but still is clear how he would express his feelings. Besides the main character's loud laugh, another important element of the movie, is the main character's dance. As it shows how his alter ego would slowly come out, which the main character has rhythm to express in the course of the story. The editing helps to be clear about how the movie has to be narrated, from the beginning to the end without ruining the narration's rhythm. The score by Hildur Guðnadóttir has been elaborated to create the atmospheres and the emotions of the story, in the main character's point of view, to be impactful as well as powerful to be unforgettable in every single musical notes. Joker is one of the greatest movies of all time, as well as one of the best movies of 2019."
3227,"No review, no pros or cons - just a masterclass in acting from Joaquin Phoenix.If he doesn't get the Oscar, or BAFTA, there is no justice... or should that be justice league - :)"
3228,"This is absolutely phenomenal, different than the other Joker movies but nonetheless brilliant."
3229,"I USED TO THINK MY WHOLE LIFE IS A TRAGEDY BUT NOW I THINK IT IS A COMEDY....The Film which every person can relate to , JOKER is a must watch for all masses. Directed and co-written by Todd Philips , the film deals with the journey of one of the most infamous villains of the DC Universe. The Journey of Arthur Flek to JOKER and the reasons behind him to become Joker.
CAST :
Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Flek was really a great choice as he perfectly fits into the character. His commandable harwork and mental preperations to get approach to the character would make you fall in love with the actor and the character as well. This was his film. As viewers we never felt that Arthur did anything suddenly. His mannerisms and acts slowly developed through his experiences. Joaquin's nervous laughter referencing it to a psychological condition (Pseudobulbular effect) , his uncontrollable run which portrays his loneliness in the society
Robert De Niro as a late night talk show host, Murray Franklin was brilliant in his performances. It was so refreshing to see sucha legendary actor actually putting a work in a commercially driven film. Although his role was small but it was effective.
STORY:
The film showcases the origin story of one of the infamous villains of the DC Universe. The first look of the film made it clear that it is going to be a masterpiece. Based on the late 1970s in Gotham City when there is extreme social and civil unrest due to high unemployment. The film has been shown through the eyes of Arthur Fleck- working as a clown in Gotham City. The film takes us on a absolute journey of him losing his control over himself , his loneliness , lack of guidance and companionship turns him into the manic state of Joker. AND ONE THING ABOUT THE MASSES WHO HAS NO IDEA ABOUT DC UNIVERSE. This film doesn't glorify the acts of Joker , neither does it has any relation with the Batman series. It simply showcases the USA in 1970s and how the common masses felt oppressed and angry towards the prieveged. How people gravitates anyone who takes a stand. Absolute anarchy can lead a man to do many things and Joker portrays one of them. The fim ends on a note leaving a fine connection between child Bruce and Joker which might even lead to a sequel of the DC series
Reasons why you should watch the film
1. Todd Phillips Direction - It was really praise worthy for the director of Hangover to pull off such a humanistic approach of the Joker.
2. Joaquin's Phoenix acting, as previously said - the man's hardwork can surely bag him an Oscar. His hard work such as loosing his physical and mental health just to fit into the character. His absolute loneliness , sadness and madness have been excellently portrayed by the man.
3. Location and music. The background music was so apt that the masses could easily co-relate Athur's journey of sadness and madness
4. Dialogues. The story has been designed beautifully with the dialogues. The film has few of the greatest quotes that has not been used in films for decades.
5. Character development. I think this film is one of the very few films is DCU where a character has been built properly. It clearly portrays that a villain isn't always a superhero. It is an ordinary man who has been made villain by the oppression and loneliness of the society"
3230,"A must watch, shows a great insight into why he became the man he was..... Shows you how real life can be......."
3231,"I did not expect that this would be that great! There is no boring part and there is always a scene that will catch you off-guard, not expecting it. The effort of their whole team deserves many awards because this is a very genius creation!"
3232,"I've seen memes and comments on social networks, but all that fell short. Joaquin Phoenix's performance was incredible, the physical transformation he had and how he performed the behavior of a person with mental illness. It is a critique of how society interacts with forgotten people.
At first I did not understand what was happening, but in the end I got the message."
3233,"Believe the 10 stars. It's that good. I really did go and see it 3 times (wouldn't it be great to have to upload your tickets to comment haha). So anyway, it's that good it proves that if something is that good you will spill money into it.The writing and performance is spectacular. The colours, camera work (so much beautiful art and passion went into this and you can tell). Joaquin puts in such an amazing performance that it doesn't feel like a performance, it feels like someone passionately believing in what He is starring in and not just here for the paycheck.The director, god bless you. You are a God among men, as the recent dross of the last decade you have reset the clock in movies and vindicated us the fans that Hollyweird is capable (when they stay hands off) of great art. So God bless you Todd Philips for fighting the industry for 2 years to bring this to screen and give us something so heartfelt.Everything about this movie is so spot on I really hope (if you havent) give it a chance. The 1 star shills should be ashamed. As should the Lame Stream MSM who were so wrong. I payed, yes PAYED to see this beautifull work of art 3 times, have bought the wonderfull vinyl soundtrack on (limited to 750 purple vinyl) & am awaiting the release of 4k steel book blu ray so I can watch this many more times.Hollywood take notice. People will invest money into things they LOVE."
3234,"I don't wanna get hate for this but I truly expected more , like the movie got too much publicity, meanwhile in the other hand The Irishman was a masterpiece but no one really talked about it
and ya I felt joaquin phoenix perfomance was kinda little bit feminem especially when he talks."
3235,"I rarely go to movies anymore because I think modern movies are hollow and nothing but reboots, sequels that are done to death, etc, but after I saw how much hate the ppl#x27;s and people were giving it and how it was apparently going to trigger an ""incel rebellion"" I just needed to check it out. The media HATED this movie and wanted it to fail, which is why this is one of the best movies in a long time. You know somethings amazing when the right people hate it.Arthur Fleck is a man who is disabled, bullied, and constantly shat on by society. Out of a job and taking care of his mother things take a turn for the worse. After seeing how crazy America is getting with wealth inequality, the militarization of police, super-rats, he has taken the black pill and realizes that nothing else matters in such a cruel and insane society. Arthur has had enough and becomes a celebrity that modern America deserves.This movie and it's themes of mental illness and childhood abuse reminded me a lot of Natural Born Killers which was released 25 years ago in 1994. In that movie, Bonny and Clyde characters Mickey & Mallory Knox have both been abused by their parents as well as having mental issues, decide to go on killing spree that makes headlines.I wasn't expecting this movie to have a lot of action but it didn't need it. Every minute is just as grungy, morose, and depressing as the one that comes after it. The atmosphere is so incredibly dark and hopeless which meshes perfectly with the gritty subject matter. This is in total contrast to 2008's Joker which was packed with action and was more of a good vs evil tale.The dialog is amazing. The acting is amazing. The music is amazing. Everything about this movie is top-tier.I never even knew Todd Phillips directed it until I saw his name on it and then the realization hit me. This is the same man who started off his career with a documentary movie on legendary shock-punk rocker GG Allin called ""Hated"". If anyone hasn't seen that I recommend you do as well as it shows the making of a legend.In conclusion, I think this movie perfectly encapsulates the state of modern western society. That on which is decaying and on it's last legs. Arthur becomes the norm."
3236,Simply great Joaquin Phoenix showed us a joker we needed to see a birth story of what and how and he did it successfully
3237,"This absolutely blew me away! I LOVED this movie! Joaquin Phoenix absolutely nailed his role as Arthur Fleck. That laugh though! I think Phoenix did a really good job with playing the broken man, who is being disregarded and bullied by society. Some people are skeptical around the fact that the movie is ""asking us to side with a psychopathic murderer."" I don't look at it that way. I say that the movie doesn't necessarily make us sympathize with him, I just look at it as telling his story. Now, sure, the first two acts of the movie seem to make us feel bad for Arthur, the man whose weird laugh and personality make everyone either turn away from him or be rude to him. But that is the only way the movie can actually even work. If the first two acts are showing us his horrible life, and we don't even care, then nothing about this would work and everyone would hate the Joker. But Todd Phillips and Scott Silver did a fantastic job at telling his story. I feel like the ending could've been altered. It probably could've ended with him looking at everyone while standing on that car, or even when he said, ""You probably wouldn't get it"" to that lady in the hospital. Overall, this film was a twisted look behind one of the greatest comic book villains!"
3238,"Yes, yes it is. Just based off the fact they're playing Sinatra half the movie was darn good enough for me. I believe Juaquin and Phillips nailed it. A lot of ppl will dislike this movie I bet. Probably offends them in some way. Well then don't watch if you're one of those people."
3239,Brilliant acting brilliant script couldn't have been anymore better.
3240,"Someone said to me that Arthur Fleck chooses to burn the world he's not adapted to, and I answered her: it wasn't a choice. It was an escape, his only true option towards earning some satisfaction, opposed to endless misery he was constantly living in. Arthur never had any joy, or at least some degree of vindication of any kind in ""the normal world"", as this normal world battered and beleaguered him at every turn, putting him down repeatedly as that would be his place. Did he lash out? No, he got up like a good boy, over and over again, dozens of times just to be thrown down again. Until one day, he fought back, surprising himself he could do it! And what do you know? It worked! Shocked by the outcome, he tried again the worlds way, the kind and tolerant way, and the world has again made fun of him, and thus leaving him with the only option that makes him feel something besides it, the only option that works: to fight back, realizing that ultimately the only way you could have some satisfaction in this up world if you are Arthur Fleck, is to rebel against it! And that's funny, especially when you've been such a good boy, trying to do good by everyone! This is the true final paradox, the realization that the answer hit you in the face and you didn't see it all along, and this fact makes him think his life is an actual comedy rather than a tragedy. As I said in my few words of my previous review, the only way The Joker could be the hero is if he would somehow be able to make everyone else seem like the villains! And for the very 1st time, in this majestic masterpiece called Joker, he vilifies the whole society, and from a certain point of view arising the need for it to burn!Of course his life is one of tragedy, one of the cruelest imaginable. The very distance between perpetual humiliation and the choice to fight back being so tiny, but in the same time his inability to see it for so long is what constitutes the final paradox, almost making it sound like a comedy. Throughout the movie he cries while laughing or laughs while crying, but that's not the initial paradox. The initial paradox (reason) is easily spotted by anyone with deep enough empathy: when our human nature isn't able to handle the troubles anymore, pain seems unstoppable and the overflow of negative emotions is handled in opposing fashion. When the more you try, the worse it gets, you have 2 options: either you give up completely and kill yourself or although it hurts, you just laugh it out, you spit fate right in it's face! Arthur has lived this particular emotional paradox way before the action in the movie begins, because living it so many times before, by the time the movie starts the paradox is already part of his conscience, it's already a pathology, that's why when he's feeling unexpectedly sad or edgy, he's sent back in his mind to the paradox, to the uncontrolled laughter. That being the former reason for his behavior, the later being his whole life was a lie, from his detrimental mother to his submissive behavior; once cured from both, he could free himself from the decades of suffering also. The final paradox being the inconceivable: the fight against society bringing him vindication, instead of obvious defeat! Here is where our Joker differs from all of the villains of literature or classical culture, you can't pick a fight with society and win! Well, as it turns out... you can, if you're Joaquin Phoenix! Even his name is somewhat predestined for this, he was a good actor with an accomplished career but nobody had the nerve to call him genius before. And when everyone has forgotten about him, expecting him to die and be buried as an actor that will never know greatness, he arises and slams the door over your face with this Joker! And now, nobody can call him less than a genius, not even those who's brains aren't skilled enough to appreciate the movie.So this is the initial paradox described in detail: you try to do right by your workplace - you're rewarded with laughter and abuse, you try to do a good thing in a buss - you're rewarded with insult and affront, you take good care of your mother, you go to (the super fun) work to provide for her, you wash her, you cook for her, you speak nice to her and listen to her - you find out she abused you when you were a boy without even knowing, that she's crazy, and the ultimate buffer reward of all: she's not even your mother! Notwithstanding the fact you're having a romance with the attractive colored neighbor that lives down the hall, that supposedly can carry you through the rough times, just to be again rewarded with the stupefyingly truth: SUPRISE, IT'S ALL IN YOUR HEAD! (I lost it there.) There's no way that you wouldn't ultimately laugh at the merit that's completely at odds with the reward given, without fu.king exception! It's way over the stage of complete sadness, it's complete madness, it doesn't make sense, and what do you do when something intense felt doesn't make sense? You laugh. You go back and forth between tragedy and comedy like it's a roller coaster, a confusion trip from which there's no escape! It's no rational confusion, there's nothing wrong with Arthur's reason, it's an emotional confusion, 2 opposite feelings experienced in the same time! If we accept as common practice that we can cry out of sadness, sometimes even out of joy, Arthur teaches us that under extraordinary duress, prolonged indefinitely, one can laugh out of sadness. Moreover so, you can develop a pathology in this regard. What he feels in the moment he realizes everything is a lie is the most choking emotion possible, when you're at your utmost end of your mental supplies, fallen past the edge. I have never quite seen that so well described as in this movie! Arthur's reason is never impaired, no matter how strong negative emotions, they never quite conquer his reason but flow in sink with it, as such, the radical difference between those who kill themselves and him is that he realizes that he still has value, even if nobody notices it, not even his own mother ""Aren't you supposed to be funny, to be a comedian?"". But real or not, he believes ""People are starting to notice!"", even though he is contradicted by the gross reality of his failed stand up comedy. Oddly enough, he's not completely wrong as that sentence starts becoming reality just after he's left without anything more to lose, and forced to act as much as he can in his own defence, as nobody else does! Masterpiece. Need I say more? No problem.Just because he's left better off at the end of this movie than at it's beginning, doesn't mean we're gonna see a happy Joker in Joker 2! Not by a long shot, but strictly comparing him with his Joker one torment, I think he will be considerably better. I am surprised the creator of this movie, being one and the same, has actually decided to make a sequel! No matter how much money you receive from the producer company, to my mind, I can't possibly imagine how you could write a continuation, without tarnishing Arthur's personality shown in Joker 1. You can't turn him directly 150 degrees (considering 30 degrees he's already turned at the end of the 1st movie), a proper solid turn must be made, time and character consuming, because as we should know by now, Arthur cares a lot about ""nobody's people"" that have decency and compassion, even if he doesn't realize it, like he was until just recently, like the dwarf guy is and Arthur kissed him fatherly over his baldness showing his emotions of appreciation ""You're the only one who's ever been kind to me!"", making it blatantly obvious he does not ignore kindness in people. As opposite to what he shots his gun at! Occasionally dips his scissors in. (I like that Jackie Chan moment there, you can use any household item as a weapon - Kung Fu, right?) Joking aside, Arthur's morals are strong and the most obvious when he shouts his heart out on Gotham television ""Nobody thinks how it's to be the other guy!"", motto that in my opinion is the very center of his character! But that doesn't fit one bit with the classic Joker of the comic books or Nolan's Joker from The Dark Knight, it's a totally new approach of a Joker! That's why I love him. And those who think that motto is a joke, deserve more than just a bullet through their infectious thoughts, they would get off too easy! Because they are left way behind on the chapter of emotional inferno and need to be compensated accordingly, in order to understand what's it like! One of them being the rich mayor to be as he calls all of those trapped in this inferno as ""Nothing but clowns!"". But he gets what's coming to him, although a bit more pain wouldn't have hurt rather than complete oblivion that doesn't do him any good, aside from rising later on The Dark Knight. Back to Arthur and his live performance, nobody would have even cared what he shouted on that podium with all his might, if he wouldn't have made a clear point at the end, pointing out who's mean, why and what's coming to them mean ones, exemplified plenty and without any doubt! If he wouldn't have, they would have just thrown him out in the street like a piece of garbage and his words with him.I want to say that another impressive feature is that this movie despite it's visceral drama also has cool comedy in it, some obvious, some noticed at later viewing and exemplify them but I'm running out of character space(..) In conclusion, in my 1st review I said that the scenery is just good enough, but after seeing the movie 4 times I realized just how brilliant it is! Combined with one of the best performances of an actor in the history of cinematography and a sound theme that make your eyes fall off right between your tears, it can't be denied as one of humanity's all time masterpieces. When or if alien races will ever contact us, there's ample reason we are a worthy race, just like Arthur and this movie is my proof towards our humanity's worth."
3241,"This is a standalone film for The Joker, to understand his character and really identify with his personality! welcome to the beginning of the end! The film compells you to believe the joker can justify his crimes! That one man does have the power to take down those who abuse their so called "" higher social status""A man whose childhood has been subjected to acts of Evil, and has continued to suffer more subtly throughout his adult life, we as the audience must believe he is out to force that evil upon the world! So that they too, know for a moment, what's it's like to be the victim! This is his reasoning! A coming of age depicts a character created out of pure Evil. A society which has failed to recognise and listen, a society where everything is seen as a product. A society which divides people and forces entertainment to be at the heart of people's lives, sacrificing the expense of another's misery along the way. Anyone with a heart will feel empathy and understanding towards the Joker.Batman is one of my favourite characters, becuase his abilities are not overly far-fetched, and the sense of what could be real is far more believable than having the ability to fly! But truthfully their would be NO BATMAN without the joker.And here you have Joaquin Phoenix portraying the joker in a light never seen before! His performance is remarkable, diverse, captivating and emotional!Honestly, this is the best acting performance I have ever seen, regardless of genre, since solo performances from the likes of Kevin Spacey.I am grateful to be one of the first to have witnessed such a powerful performance in the cinema on it's initial release date! And will continue to discuss this film, whenever the topic of greatest movies/ acting performances arise!Generations after generations after generations, this film should be considered as framework for Drama/Media/ filming students and people whom want to pursue an acting career.Joaquin Phoenix you are a legend! This was a masterclass performance and you deserve all the fame and glory at all the award ceremonies!"
3242,"This movie was an masterpiece!! Holy crap, this was good!!!"
3243,"There was a lot of hype behind this movie, negative and positive. I was following the positive and was really looking forward to it.I am going to start by saying ""well done"" to Joaquin Phoenix for an amazing performance. He was absolutely believable. You can and can't relate to what is going on in his mind. It is twisted in the Joker sense.Now, I found the movie dragged in areas and found my mind wandering or slightly dozing off. I could have easily watched this in 2 sittings. My issue with this movie is that it is a really dark(subject) movie and by the time it ended, I felt really down and spent. It was almost like it was work to watch. It has absolutely no replay-ability for me. A movie really needs to draw me in to watch over and over again, usually in to the double digits. That movie is a 9 . I don't want to watch this again and that is why it gets a 3.5 and that is all Joaquin Phoenix.Will I watch the next Joker movie? Absolutely."
3244,"Picture a world where Taxi Driver meets DC. Honestly, this movie is the closest I've seen to a 10/10 in recent years.WARNING: Do not watch this expecting to see another Dark Knight or Batman Vs Sup! This film is closer to a Scorsese/OldNolan film than a blockbuster film. This is an entirely new take on the Joker so quit comparing it to Ledgers Joker.With a budget of 50 Million dollars, Phillips manages to pull off a phsyc-thriller film set in the 70s with actor Joequin Phoenix as the lead role of Arthur Fleck, the Joker.Phoenix in this movie is truly convincing. The music puts the audience in Arthurs head and the cinematography is superb! Costume design is great with everything in this movie being convincing and complex, yet not complicated enough to lose the audience.This is a must watch movie with many twists and turns, being in the head of Arthur Fleck is an incredibly unique take on mental illness. With scenes questioning and evaluating your own choices in life against other people , which is what every legendary film has managed to achieve.You will definitely not leave the theatres glistening with a joyful smile as if you watched the sun rise, but you will still be satesfied like every reviewer so far. The lowest of ratings will at least say ""You won't regret it""P.s' people giving this movie bad reviews have:
Compared it to The Dark KnightA Slow attention span (prefer movies with Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson, and transformers, Shaw and Hobbs)Come in the theatres Super hyped (Sorry)Been paid to give bad reviews"
3245,"Outstanding, The best film i watched this year. very gory and haunting,
but joaquin's performance is perfect and the plot was unpredictable."
3246,Wow. This is an incredible journey. It's heartbreaking and absolutely brutal. Amazing performance from Joaquin.
3247,I could not find any word to tell about my feelings. Actually i would see myself in this incredible movie. It was the best psychosociological movie.
3248,Now this is how you make a movie..This is how you act..This is an amazing film..Joker is just incredible.. Masterpiece is an understatement..
3249,"As an avid DC fan, I have been waiting so long to see this film and last night, I finally did. After all the hype, I was sceptical as to whether or not it would actually meet its potential.
It's safe to say that it scored well above and beyond anything I imagined.
Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal. His acting feels very raw; such a troubled character who's played so beautifully. Whilst you will always get the comparative question of ""who's better? Ledger or Phoenix?"" I argue that the two explore completely different stages in the Joker's life and thus are utterly incomparable. Phoenix's performance did not feel like a performance, more-so an observation into the life of a man who I truly felt devastatingly sorry for. His actions of violence seemed like the right thing to do and I almost agreed with the murderous actions he inflicted. Marvel, eat your heart out. You've met your match!"
3250,"Masterpiece of a movie, if you haven't seen it yet, go and do it.
Joaquin Pheonix's performance was breathtaking, the story is captivating and interesting. A lot of critics painted this film in a bad light, but from the user reviews, that just shows how out of touch some can be."
3251,Pleasse pleasse pleassse dont f#&k this one up. DC needs to keep going in that direction no cgy bull$#! No crazy over the top explotions or falling building. Just greate story telling. This is the best movies of the year.
3252,"Deep thoughts in the sense that the film takes us inside the character of the Joker, and the society shows us deeper and becomes clear to us scenes of persecution, violence and bullying against the likes of the Joker, and makes us justify the scenes of violence justified at the level of the film and not an absolute justification in life, because we realized the motives are not violence but in defense of Self, the last thing is (Joachim Felix ..."
3253,"100 reasons to like JOKER, but I'll only give you one as all the other reviews on here cover the other 99 reasons why this is the best film of 2019 and possibly this decade! So here it is, it is a film with authenticity in its heart, a film that feels real, and not the forced virtue signal that most of today's failing Hollywood vomits out... 10 out 10"
3254,"Joker has probably one of the best depictions of mental illness I have ever seen on film. There's no point in comparing Joaquin Phoenix to Heath Ledger's portrayal, since these are two different interpretations of the character. As a character, Arthur Fleck is less of a criminal mastermind and more of a loner that feels put upon by society. And he eventually snaps like Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver. And therein lies my problem with this movie, there's a lot of Martin Scorsese pastiche in this film and sometimes it can come off as a bit too glib.But Todd Phillips is a clever enough director to do some interesting things with his storytelling to make the film engaging. The film has a very grainy 70's look that makes it feel like a grindhouse movie from that era. I also love the super rat discussions on the radio, and I love the boiling tensions between the wealthy elites and the poor people of Gotham city, you get the sense that a class war could erupt in Gotham city at any minute. I also like that Todd Phillips made Thomas Wayne a smarmy prick, he's not the saintly Wayne like we're use to seeing in the other Batman movies.This version of Thomas Wayne is less of a philanthropist and more of a
slimy politician. It was a bold choice to make this character something else entirely and it's wickedly subversive. Zazie Beetz is also great in a small role as Sophie Dumo the object of Arthur's desire.In conclusion, I wish Joker was longer because even at 115 minutes it feels a bit rushed. Perhaps they could have fleshed out Arthur Fleck's relationship with his mother a bit more? But despite my quibbles, this is still a good movie elevated by Joaquin Phoenix's performance as Arthur Fleck. Ultimately, Joker is a character study about a deeply troubled man and this film is definitely worth seeing."
3255,"Of the thousands of reviews already published, usually the sign that there's something worthy of the attention, here is what you need to know. It's dark, it barely has any ties to the DC Comics franchise but for a minor scene with character young Bruce Wayne, there are no big special effects nor elaborate action scenes; that's it for the ""not in this movie"". What it does have is great character development, a storyline you'd find in any great tragedy novel, opera, play and of course movie, and superb acting for the lead character, Arthur Fleck, played by Joaquin Phoenix.I try not to copy from my web friend's reviews, but sometimes it's hard not to use his observations when I share them; indeed David Ferguson (ferguson-6) is my 'goto' review source as he is a reviewer extraordinaire. In Joker's case he mentions, as did another friend and movie aficionado did, that the co-writer and director Todd Phillips surprised us with this movie, in that his previous work would not lead us to expect what he delivered here. Way to go Todd!I won't repeat or mention the storyline, you probably have read it and should (use ferguson-6 review storyline); it could easily fit as prequel to ""The Dark Knight"", the movie which garnered the 2009 best supporting actor win for Heath Ledger in his role as the Joker. As fine, okay 'great', as Ledger's performance was, Phoenix' is not a bit less than great too. Joaquin Phoenix has earned two Oscar nominations already in the past, for best actor and one for best supporting actor and it's time he gets the win because he deserves it. The Joker conveys well where his darkness comes from, and Phoenix is very believable in a character that barely is when you relate it to your own life; it's what I mean by him deserving an Oscar for that performance.I usually pay attention to the OST (original soundtrack) and when I listened to the last track as I watched the closing scene, I couldn't help my self and went """"Wow!"""
3256,"A masterpiece. Nothing else to say....
Joaquin is going to win oscars for this."
3257,"This is not a movie , its reality , ur not living life if you didn't watch this"
3258,"Joaquin Phoenix acting,dance scenes,music,final scene where he dance on police car,Joaquin's laugh,perfect story for joker, how he cry while laughing and.... .he should and must get all prizes and awards also a better prize than oscar just for him."
3259,"I feel at a loss for words, but this should get what it deserves and it deserves at least a good attempt to express what I felt about this film , I know That watching this film , I experienced something important. Something life changing, something that could actually make a difference. It has substance, it has spirit, it has a message. They took a 2d comic book character and breathed life into it , now it's full blown 5th dimension it has life and soul and truth , it's heartbreaking. Formidable! Applause Applause Applause. Thank you for making this film, it's like living at the same time as Da Vinci or Michelangelo, and getting to witness virtuoso genius front row. I'm blown away.
Amazing seamless character development. I can't , I'm worried to try to put this in words and categorize it. The music, the acting, the costumes, the settings , just a perfect complete masterpiece of art , you can't box it in or compare it to anything else it's in a league of it's own . it's just a perfect film experience and I truly agree with all the love it's getting . I really hope they make a sequel or two or five."
3260,"Without saying much, when a movie keeps pop up infront of you in all social media, and still a subject to discuss with friends and others..
Then it must be that kind of movie that comes every 10-20 years.."
3261,"They show us how he Living with Desperate world.
Social issues with people.
Can't Protect himself Against the society.
Can't control his emotions.
Eats lot of Medications.
Suffers from a sick condition.
Becoming the Joker:
starts changing his attitude, , Attending stand up comedies, writing jokes for his comedies. Liar friends, can't stand the problems with the society its self ,they Beating him up, After that he sick of the how the society treat him and then his attitude change with the worse."
3262,This was the best role of the Joker I have ever seen hands down. It portrays the jokers character to be dark but gives a sense of innocence. The film was made just brilliantly.
3263,"Not sure what you low-reviewers are thinking, but this movie is amazing. I cannot even say how great Phoenix is, and how much you feel Arthur's pain. I for one can relate to how he feels by being judged and rejected, and I believe it needs a higher score. Yeah, life is messy, uncomfortable and painful. For those of you that can't handle this movie, don't see it. Don't give it a review based on what you can or can't handle. Joker offers a very real take on life that is seen through a lot of peoples eyes, and it's very sad. But it somehow gives comfort to those of us that are overlooked, maybe because we feel seen for once in our lives? Anyway, it's a great movie. See it."
3264,"""Joker"" has changed the Hollywood. Low budget became a great movie. Amazing script, directing and soundtrack. But Joaquin Phoenix is above all these tecniques aspects. Oscar is coming..."
3265,"Joker is not your typical superhero action sci-fi fantasy spectacular, which, given it is (perhaps) an origin story of a super villain is entirely appropriate. Thank goodness.There is nothing wrong with big dumb superhero action movies, and indeed some of the (unending) stuff churned out by Marvel(Disney), and even D.C.(Warner) manages to elevate itself above the dumb category and even has something important/artistic to say.However, we are now deep in the over-saturation mire, and personally I am not sure how much more superhero spectacle films I can take. The last film of this ilk I bothered to go and see at the cinema before Joker was Thor: Ragnarok, and I absolutely loved it, and decided to bow out on a high, I promised myself it was the last superhero film I was going to pay money to go and see.Then I saw the trailers for Joker. This is a film that is, at its heart, is a character study, and a character study against the backdrop of a lack of social services and mental health support, a great chasm of inequality between rich and poor, with a central character who is clearly in desperate need of exactly that kind of help.You can take this film one of several ways.******************************SPOILERS ALERT*******************************1) It is a film about a character who, without the help he needs and deserves, descends into an inescapable spiral of mental instability leading to extreme violence and inspiring riotous rage around him against the wealthy citizens of society, who seem to neither care or worse, actively exploit people like him.2) It is a clever re-imagining of some of finest work of Martin Scorsese (particularly Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy and After Hours) in such a way as to ensure that the (still very pertinent) messages of those films are conveyed to a youthful audience that might otherwise not watch those excellent films.3) The greater majority of what we see in the film takes place in the mind of the lead character, who, as we have seen before in The Dark Knight, is economical with the truth about his own origin story, although in this case perhaps this is done to weave a sympathetic web for himself to ensnare the psychiatrist examining his case so that he might kill her and escape.Or perhaps it is all of those things. Either way, I feel some of the criticisms levelled at this film by some of the negative reviews are unfair.Some have pointed out that we see here none of the genius-level plotting and planning that the comic books lead us to expect from the Joker (who usually plays Moriarty to Batman's Sherlock) which is true, in this version Joker falls into his insanity and criminality almost by accident, and is more a (fairly) dumb victim than an active agent of his own destiny. However, if this is all a day-dream or even a psychotic fantasy Joker develops for himself to justify in his own mind his heinous actions, then this totally makes sense.Some have pointed out the dark and depressing nature of the film. Well, look around yourself at the moment. Films reflect the times they are made, and let's face it; we are living in dire circumstances.Some have criticised the simplicity and shallowness of the story, well, as a character study you do not need the most riveting plot (just look at the excellent Withnail & I) you need an interesting character/s to explore. We certainly have that!Some, perhaps most fairly, have criticised how, apart from the few vague references to Gotham and the Wayne family this could be a story about anyone, not really specifically about the Joker...well I believe that is partly the point. There but for the Grace of God Go I kind of thing...Some have criticised how crowbarred the moments of interaction with the Wayne family into the plot are, but again, if this is a deluded fantasy of a man in Arkham, perhaps even after he has been put there by Batman (after all even though the film seems to be set in the 70s, at the end when he clearly is in the institute, we could be at any time, and the time period could just be part of his fantasy) this is perhaps just an articulation of how his fixation with Bruce Wayne developed.For me, the only way this film is not a straight ten out of ten, is because as it is so referential to the works of Martin Scorsese mentioned above one cannot but help compare this film with the work of that great director, and, as wonderful as this film is, it is not quite as accomplished as a Taxi Driver, a Goodfellas or a Casino...however, as a gateway for new cineastes to step into those superior works, I for one will forever be grateful for the existence of this fine film.At its core, this film is well shot, well-constructed, and features one of the best central performances from an actor I have seen in years. Apart from the constant clever references to Charlie Chaplin and the clear love letter to Scorsese, this film works best as a concentration on the ability of Phoenix to bend his face, voice and entire body into a perfect canvas to paint a work of art on. This performance is pure, raw, measured, superb beyond my imagining. Wow is an appropriate word.The end of the film is pure perfection, our lead character happily walking into the sunset (sort of) and dancing a jubilant jig, chased, very much like Chaplin's Tramp, by uncaring figures of authority, whom he seems to be leading a merry dance. Unlike the last film with Chaplin's Tramp, Modern Times, referenced visually in Joker, instead of the Tramp and the Gamin walking into the sunset determined to not be bowed by the dire circumstances they find themselves in, renewed with a fresh sense of hope in their faith and love for each other, Joker's equivalent dance into the sunset is rather his full acceptance of his insanity, and his commitment to revel in the horror of it.To top it all off, for a 'relatively small' character-and-dramatic driven film to become the most profitable comic book adaptation ever is brilliant, and gives me a renewed sense of hope for the future. Maybe this is the way for D.C./Warner Bros. instead of trying to copy the big budget all out visual spectacle of the shared universe of Marvel, make small, tight, well made character driven pieces...after all, many of the characters in the D.C. universe are well worth such introspective examination.If you haven't seen this film yet at the cinema, and it is still on anywhere near you, go see it now, really, I urge you, and you never know, you might just save cinema..."
3266,"This film absolutely blew me away. I watched it three weeks ago and it's still on my mind and I'm not exactly sure why - all I know is that it is a profound film that stays with you. I am never as affected by movies like I have been for this film. The acting, the cinematography and the very deep issues it faces was just mind blowing. One of my best cinema experiences. Phoenix was truly incredible and I hope he gets an Oscar for his performance. Those who haven't seen this film yet, really must! You're missing out!"
3267,"This movie is the greatest movie i ever saw, in my opinion its even better then The Dark Knight ! it was an incredible experience to watch it in the cinema with the dolby sound system and the amazing graphics. Phoenix did it as good as Ledger even i didnt expect him to. I had to sit down after the movie ended to get it out of my system while everyone was leaving i was thinking Finally a joker origin movie which had the guts to give this villian a name, a story and a perpective."
3268,"I just made an account, to rate this masterpiece. This film shows a different angle on the psychology of the nature vs nurture debate on whether evil people are born evil or made evil by the neglect of society. This film hits home hard, and that is how art should be. It should disturb the comfortable and comfort the disturbed."
3269,"At the moment WB announce Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker I was smiling cause I knew this can't flop. Joaquin is a fabulous actor. I was keen to see him portraying my favorite villain and I think The Joker is the most known and impressive villain ever made.Notes to the people that telling you it's not worth it: Well that's the same people that believes 96 Hours is the best movie they ever seen. They have a limit in taste of movies. Jokes aside don't let them distract you when they say there is no action and clear storyline. It's a drama movie not a highflying stunt movie.I love the atmosphere and the motions Todd Phillips created. This feels so authentic and convincing. As a Batman fan I knew how the Joker the character itself was buildup and the movie catches more viewers who never had watched a Batman movie or read a comic book. Several brillant actor played Joker in their own way and I really don't like people saying: Every Joker portraying was trash, but Heath Ledgers was perfect. The thing is the other Jokers we've seen in the Batman movies were the character already became the movie doesn't show how things made him become The Joker. An advantage for this movie of course !The movie has a strong message for people with mental disease and how much impact humanity and respect for each other has on a person. The movie wouldn't be successful if it wasn't about a DC character.My review might be awful but I'm speechless to go more in detail.Joaquins acting was outstanding. He really made me think he's a psycho. Such a good acting. I wonder what his secrets are for preparing for this role. I wonder how he acted off screen at the set.I really hope this movie gets an Oscar since this is the only top movie of the year I have seen I think the chance is very high."
3270,"Pure perfection, say no more. Literally the best performance ive ever seen."
3271,Even though it was a very long movie it was definitely worth it! I loved this movie so so much! GOOD JOB TO THE CAST!!!
3272,Its not often I sit through a movie not realising how long it's been going for. This movie finished and I thought there was another hour to go. Really good character progression. Awsome acting. I hope there is a second one!
3273,Unfortunately this Movie represents Dark Side of me. Which is i never shared with anyone. 😑
3274,Finally just got to see this and it is great! It is a character study of the Joker and I hope that Warner Brothers take note of what to do with their future films.
3275,"Its a master piece of Oscar goes to Joaquin Phoenix, No doubt he deserves an Oscar for acting. What an amazing movie, We can see many faces of Arthur fleck. You can see cry, laugh, Pain, in this movie. Amazing performance by Phoenix.
A must watch movie in a life time."
3276,Such a good film. The character building is done superbly and the light and shade from the jokers day to day life to his imagination is seamless. So clever to see the real man and his dark side steeped in mental illness. Gave me goose bumps on many occasions and also a few nervous giggles from the madness of the scenes. One of my top 10 films of all time and would love to see Joaquin receive the highest awards possible for this masterpiece.
3277,"What a movie, beautiful amazing emotional dark creative.. All that without the typical action. This is a masterpiece, you get into the mind of joker and understand the logic behind his behaviour. Joaquin Phoenix, a well deserved actor truly marvelous.. Fantastic A star acting.."
3278,"The most empathetic spiral into a rage fuelled desire to belong in a realistic, cruel but not-so-dissimilar to reality kind of way. Almost a psychological expose on how home grown terrorists feel and are made; how kids end up shooting up schools. This is how. Bullying, ostracism, falling through the cracks of society and extreme disparities in class and privilege lead to the breakdown of society. Brilliantly told and acted, it was reminiscent of Hong Kong's demonstrations (masks and rebellion against power authorities), Escobar-like villainous anti-establishment virtue with a V-for-Vendetta flavour. The best film I've seen in a long time. Didn't think Heath could be outdone but it was. Here's to hoping the Batman franchise is reborn with the same realism and darkness thats always been a tad missing, even under Nolan's direction. This is adult, gritty, real comic which has deeper comments on society and needs to be the new standard in comic based film. Logan (Hugh Jackman's final Wolverine) comes a distant second after Joker."
3279,"Let's talk today about the sensational premiere of the movie ""Joker"". Screenwriters invite us to look at the life of an ordinary person, which, under the influence of modern society, turns into something that brings justice to the masses through violence. The main character - the joker (aka Arthur Fleck) from childhood was subjected to violence from his stepfather, in addition, Arthur was an adopted child, which also left a significant imprint on his fate. On the basis of these childhood horrors that he had to endure, in adulthood he is an unhealthy person with some deviation in behavior. he is haunted by causeless attacks of laughter, which he cannot control. For this peculiarity Arthur was repeatedly subjected to physical violence and beating by this very embittered society, which has no interest in accepting anything beyond.This film makes us (the audience) think about what we bring to the world in which we live. how we relate to the people around us. Seemingly harmless words and jokes break the soul and consciousness of a person. how does he turn on this basis into a psychologically unbalanced neurotic who can kill even his loved ones. It is not surprising that the film received a rating of 9.4 out of 10. The audience was imbued with the fate of the Joker, seeing in it a piece of themselves. I think such films have people rethink their attitude to others. and change in the first place yourself. then everything around will begin to change.
Thanks for your attention.

3280,"Simply put, one of the best movies and actor performance you'll ever have the privilege to witness. Mind blowing and breathtaking don't even begin to describe how great this movie truly is."
3281,"I just watched it. And I want to say: ""So What?"". Worthless, rude and senseless. What the main idea? Is it will fill the gap between countless ""batman's universe movies""? Okay. I'm happy about that. If you decide to watch ""story about sick man"" just find ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" by Milos Forman. Overrated ""blockbuster"". With a ""zillion dollars budget"" spent on advertising."
3282,"I can't complain about the acting but I was a little disappointed that this was more a commentary on mental health than the DC origins story I was hoping for. The climax fell a little short for me too, so I was disappointed overall at what has to have been the most hyped film of the year.
Still better than Ad Astra though."
3283,"The film is about tragedy and a work of art that should be taken seriously, no CGI cape crusader, no magic just pure emotions . It's like the rise of the Joker and the birth of the Bat. The laughter makes you cry and youre wating for that villain you love to hate but end up loving him more.... I wish there is more.. i wish to see this joker in the DCU."
3284,One of the very best comic book movies of all time and just a brilliant film overall.
3285,"I was excited to see this film and I must admit that it exceeded my expectations by far! I can't say enough about how amazing Joaquin Phoenix is in this film. I just love and adore when an actor sinks their teeth into a role this deep. It's obvious he had a real passion for this character and he simply shined. I can't imagine another actor playing this character in this particular film.I rarely rate films a ten especially these days. Film making has been absolutely horrible pretty much since we moved into the 21st century. That may sound harsh, but it's true. Film makers have lost their guts and their passion. This film is gritty and it's raw. It may sound strange to say, but it's beautiful. I actually found it liberating and I started to worry about myself for feeling that way, but this film makes you look at a lot of s***. We haven't come much further since 1981 in many aspects and that's really sad. The first act was extremely hard to watch. His struggle was real and so relatable. I was literally crying. The feels just didn't stop coming and when he finally took a stand and defended himself the audience was with him! I was with him. It felt like he was standing up for all of us with mental illnesses that people don't see or care about and guess what happens when those people with those mental illnesses are left untreated and they are ridiculed for something they can't control? He was standing up for the poor that can't get ahead or catch a break for s*** while the rich get richer. He was sick and tired of people laughing at him and using him for their jokes and he was done taking it.I didn't applaud after the film ended like others in the theater, but it absolutely deserved every bit of applause it got. This film is fearless. The actors, the directors, the writers, the custume designers, etc all deserve awards. I actually can't wait to see it again! I can't say enough! Must see!"
3286,To be honest I have never made comments about movies before I wanted to write SPECIFICALLY for JOKER. Joaquin showed us the best performance of all times. The directing and writing also was brilliant. Such a great movie about how the mentally ill people are raised and how the society is treating them.And what the government is doing about it. I was truly impressed by a movie how beautifully and carefully they wrote and reflected and PLAYED!
3287,"Let's ignore the phenomenal acting, directing, script, filmography, special effects etc.. You could read about those elements anywhere else.People hate or worship the Joker movie for the same reason, on its superficial level, it glorifies the madmen, the lost, the pillars of capitalism that went astray and as a viewer you might do the same, asking yourself, should I hate the Batman now? No, you are not crazy.It seems that due to non-biological, cultural-related life circumstances, the only way that Arthur Fleck could fulfill himself is to become the Joker, a title that is a part of the movie's strongest underlying, Arthur didn't choose his destiny or his new name and identity, society's strongest did and it seems like there are many people like him or at least people that identify with him as seen in the street of Gotham in the last hour of the movie.I will watch this movie as many times as I watched Pulp Fiction, maybe more, and to think that there is only one significant character in it ( OK maybe De Niro's character is important, but they are all important)"
3288,This is no action movie. This is no gratuitous big budget super hero movie. This is no 2 dimensional comic cell with flashes and bangs. This is not for the shallow drones attending opening night for every summer blockbuster Disney remake. There will be no spoon feeding here. There will be no happy endings or warm feelings.Here you will find hurt. Here you will find pain and agony. Here you will find tragedy and circumstance. Here you will find guilt and regret.Here you will find Art.
3289,"One of the greatest movie experiences of my life. Heartbreakingly sad and beautiful at the same time, plot twists that will rip your heart out, subtle social and political commentaries that are uncannily relevant worldwide, and guest cameos that will leave you reeling. A film that demands you come back for a repeat viewing in the cinema, on a screen big enough to do the story justice. This one screams OSCAR WINNER."
3290,"Not seen a film like this for many years and I totally agree with all of the reviews.
This film is one of the best I have ever seen, fantastic movie, well done."
3291,Great movie 👍🏼 i like it it is was awesome 👏🏼 better than joker the dark night
3292,"Joaquin has been one of my favorite actors for a long time and I was so happy to learn he was going to portray Joker. And boy did he deliver! The best portrayal of Joker we've ever seen, indefinitely better than ledger's Joker in TDK (one of the most overrated movies ever, although I'd rate ledger's performance as above average..good in that one).Everything about this movie was so perfect. Go see it NOW."
3293,"JOKER has succeded to highlight the most neglected harshhh reality "" Mental Health"" which is the true win for this Master piece.After a long time, seen a movie with a much needed topic addressed. And what a spectacular artist Joaqin Pheonix is, I just realized."
3294,"Every aspect of 'Joker' was executed with such detail and expertise. The third act is arguably the best third act in cinema history. Every scene was so well thought out from color pallet, to composition, to camera placement, and even to the soundtrack. Speaking of which, the soundtrack for 'Joker' is one of the best aspects of this film. Definitely an OSCAR worthy masterpiece right here! 10/10!"
3295,"I absolutely love this film. I felt so many emotions that many films do not make me feel. One of the best films of the year!
The acting was incredible, especially from Phoenix and Beetz, and De Niro. The plot and music where both incredible as well. I was entertained the entire time!"
3296,"Been a while since a well written psychological movie airing in theatre, Great plot, cinematography, and Joaqin is trully outstanding. this movie will surely make an impact in DC Cinema universe.Character development just great, how a man can change after things he take and just explode and comes insanity. visual storytelling in the cinematography showing when arthur comes up the stairs and comes down at joker is astonishing well thought."
3297,"Joker is a phenomenal movie.It's the first movie in many years that I've walked away from the cinema having actually enjoyed it. So much so I went to the cinema a second time to view it. And it was just as good second time around.Joaquin Phoenix is truly amazing in this film and his performance is honestly award worthy.This film isn't as ""superhero""-y as comic fans may have wanted, but I think that's what grounds this film and gives a more gritty and true to life tone.Simply put, a must watch."
3298,"This movie ain't a movie, this is a masterpiece.Acting in this movie is so perfect. Best Joker actor!"
3299,"Excellent cinematography, outstanding cinematography and brilliant acting."
3300,"Wow!! Now that was Fantastic!!! Joaquin Phoenix was amazing, he did a great job playing the Joker!! I love his smile!!"
3301,"I was seriously not interested in that movie after watching some clowns roaming about in the trailer - I'm getting tired of the redundant Purge movies' characters, you know ; and I'm not enjoying the new trend of blurring the lines between good and evil (e.g. Maleficent, 2019). I just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time when some friends opted for watching it, and I was baffled!The movie was nothing I had expected it to be. It is actually what a Joker backstory should be like. It is believable, intriguing and down to earth. It is really what you can call an adaptation. Todd Phillips manages to make you feel the darkness in Gotham and how it roves through the city in search of the next victim. The whole Batman universe is thus successfully explained. And Joaquin Phoenix is perfect in the role of the Joker.This movie is not really for the usual Batman fan in search of fantasy, fight scenes and high-tech accessories, but for the pragmatic moviegoers who can enjoy watching a masterpiece just like others enjoy French cuisine in a 5-starred restaurant - I'm not kidding! Great job!"
3302,"This is easily one of the best films I've seen in a very long time, and it's among the best films of all-time. My friend and I left the theatre spellbound by what we had just seen. Go see this film!"
3303,"Speechless. Wow! ALL the departments: bravo! From start to finish, I am overwhelmed with mastery."
3304,"Jouaqen Phoenix was the perfect selection for this hard role not anyone can say yes to this character it's very complex .
thank you really for this art."
3305,"I don't need to say much here except it was beautiful, harrowing, thought provoking. Phoenix's acting was so profoundly deep and moving that I cried throughout. Insanely good."
3306,"Joker actually is a mix of different genres and elements who create something unique.
You can see the Taxi Driver or King of Comedy influences but Todd Phillips Movie has more things to say ... and Joaquin's Phoenix performance helps him to do that 100 %.
I think it's the best character development I've see in a movie and the screenplay it's artistic written. Even if doesn't follow the comic mythology at all and it's very realistic and less comic book movie, Joker has a lot of elements of Batman Mythology and gives some hint to DC fans. Dark, brutal, funny and sad at the same time ... Joker is one of the best movies of the recent years."
3307,"So many movies have been over-hyped. Like Inception. A great movie, but it was so built up, a slight let down was felt, and as usual the movie fell short of the incredible hype.Joker is not that. It meets, nae, exceeds the scuttlebutt. If cookie cutter comics are your forte, better come without those glasses on.This is a way to complete the Joker personality. There is no ambiguity now. He is a chaos loving psychopath. He doesn't love sticking it to the rich, he doesn't even love killing, he loves causing chaos, and stomping on those who garner the famous Joker laugh. Unfortunately, society at large, except a few truly underfoot souls, may be on that list.
Riviting in every way."
3308,"Great performances from all involved. Phillips is awesome with telling the story he wanted and leaving room for interpretation. Expressing his own feelings of society. Conveying it through the tragic story of a person having been beaten by society, now choosing the wrong path. Letting go and giving into his own sick and twisted perspective of the world that treated him so brutally. Returning the hate and anger bestowed upon him. It's sad and wonderful, mischievous and marvelous all at the same time. As an avid comic book, movie , joker, nerd. I felt Joaquin captured his darkness that grew from innocence to violence. His quirks and ticks are exactly what I imagined a live Joker to be, without being cheesy. you see him immerse himself into the madness that lives with the Joker and becomes apart of you as you follow the rabbit hole of the joker. Great stuff, fascinating approach."
3309,"One of the best movie i've seen,Oscar to Joaquin Phoenix"
3310,"I can only echo what other people have said about this film 100% awesome
Just watch it give it time and you want be disappointed"
3311,"This is the best film I've seen in years and best acting (from Phoenix). It is a very carefully crafted film and it's clear that everyone who worked on it loved this project.
For the entirety of the film I forgot about my surroundings forgot that I was sitting in the movie theatre. I felt like I was living Arthur's life or that I'm watching him up close in person.
Phoenix is a true artist and the whole cast and crew should be VERY, AWFULLY proud of what they've given birth to. I applaud them. (Don't miss this film! Go and see it NOW!)"
3312,"This movie is so true, so raw and so painful. Brought me to tears."
3313,"Movie of the year. pure masterpieceJoaquin Phoenix
Is fantastic
Best joker after Mark Hamillpsychological build-up of an already insane man.fascinating transformationactually gets very sympathetic compassion for the villain"
3314,"A symphonic love letter to fans of the infamous Batman antagonist, the Joker.Don't expect this film to be a day in the life of the character however; as the films purpose it to show the *almost* gradually declining mental state of an extremely troubled Arthur Fleck as he sees his life crumbling around him as his eyes open to the dull and unforgiving environment of Gotham City.Overall a great film with a stellar performance by Joaquin Phoenix."
3315,"It's one of those movies that you want to see again and again and again, it's just brilliant!!!"
3316,"Considering I am not big on violence and the Batman series plus my boyfriend dragged me along to watch this, it was a great movie which portrayed Arthur developing into his persona as Joker. You feel for Arthur and empathise with his life story until his craziness goes out of control. Dark yet so relevant - spooked that I may know a few people like joker.... kidding."
3317,"I was very skeptical going into this, especially after being scarred for life with Jared Leto's Joker (ugh)..in my eyes no body could beat Heath Ledger's Joker...I must say though - Joaquin did an excellent job! This Joker to me was very deep, it showed more of the mentally ill side of the Joker rather than a crazy criminal mastermind, which he did a great job at capturing that vibe. It's deff worth a watch !!"
3318,"Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal.
This movie is a masterpiece."
3319,Don't believe people who say this movie is bad this is a masterpiece and deserves several oscars
3320,This movie is faaantastiiiic!!!! Act of Pheonix is awsome!! Everything is apsolutely fantastic!!!
3321,"Joaquin Phoenix just like the phoenix has risen back from the ashes. His performance was way beyond one could have expected from him. Performance of his life!!
An epic movie with the perfect casting, performances, background score, storyline and cinematography. This movie is gonna standout in the history in times to come. Even when I watched it the second time, I was still held on the way when I watched it the first time.
Please do watch it for Phoenix's performance, watch it to see how a perfect movie looks like."
3322,"This movie is a masterpiece!
I remember when the first teaser for this movie came out all i saw was negative reactions and confused faces, i went into this movie having it spoilt for me beforehand and even having it spoilt for me i can strongly say this is the best movie I've seen in a long long time and i just hope that future movies, mainly superhero movies will look at this for inspiration and stir away from the blank boring platform they all seem to have nowadays"
3323,"Movies been dead to me long time until this came up. I bet this movie will keep ringing a bell in years to come as it strikes the core conflict of western world cultural issue which rooted from the structure of the society which is to worship so-called property gaining success instead of moral value champions. Individuals are so detached intentionally by design to perpetuate the poor keep being poor and rich keep being rich. Self-endeavor will not matter. To success, you fight. Why? The system has been designed this way. Until at times, the people fed up, the people say enough is enough. And here is the ""Joker""."
3324,"This movie was simply beautiful, a masterpiece for all time. I think the reason why so many of us feel pity and - yes - sympathy for Arthur is because to one extent or another we have all experienced tragic moments and sorrow like he has, but we were able to pull out of our dark moments. Unfortunately, he never did.It is a truly realistic portrayal of how a cruel society can send essentially good person into the darkest depths of madness. The movie will not once let your mind drift into distraction as it is mesmerizing and fascinating from the very beginning to the very last moment. Despite the violence, you cannot help but feel for Arthur Fleck - Joaquin Phoenix's character - and may actually root for him, cheering him on in the hope that somehow everything will eventually lead to some form of happy ending for him. You'll have to see the movie to find out if it does.As for the movie reviews, some have been entirely unfair and biased for some strange reason I cannot fathom. One critic from a well known New York publication (btw, I'm from NY, too) criticized it for not being ""fun,"" which makes it absolutely clear that guy has no idea what this movie is about and should probably dedicate himself to something else. If someone is out to see a ""fun"" movie, this masterpiece is not for you. As someone said in another review below, other movies are like going to eat a hamburger; this is more like a $1,000 steak. Fortunately, the success of movies by and large do not depend on film critics but rather on the general public and what we think about them.Regarding the references to Heath Ledger, with all due respect, it's like comparing apples and oranges. I saw his performance, and it was decent for entertainment purposes. But Joaquin Phoenix's performance is simply breathtaking and perhaps unlike anything ever seen before in movie history; Joaquin Phoenix descends into actual madness before our very eyes. He takes us an a journey through the human mind, with moments of light and moments of sad and disconcerting darkness, all while winning over the audience and getting it on his side. It's a depiction of life that we can all relate to in one way or another, which is why his performance is so unique.In terms of movie directing, Todd Phillips needs to be given credit, as he should be for offering us such a masterpiece. I'm sure it will mark and change his directing career.Finally, this is a movie I will see again, and again, and again to the end of my days. My former favorite movie of all time was Planet of the Apes (1968) because it had a deep message about the world and society, one I could relate to even though I was born years later. I think 'Joker' will replace it because it has touched me so deeply. I will simply say it had such an impact on me that I couldn't help but get emotional more than once."
3325,"Joker is a difficult film to review, as it will be a difficult film to enjoy for some people because it's not a single layered story, and it does not try to help you understand it. It requires your involvement to pay attention, question things, look for clues regarding what's really happening in the story. Before the final act, it does answer one important question so that everyone is more or less on the same page, but it blurs the lines once again in its ending as to what really happened in that final act. It's a tough movie. It depicts mental illness, its perception, its management, its treatment, its place in society, in a cold, hard, brutally realistic manner. It's not glamorized, or ""sweetened"" to make it more likable or relatable. It's not a super hero, or super villain story. It's a downward spiral into the mind of a very sick individual who tries to stay above water but eventually gives in to his inner demons because no other option is there for him, it's a movie about where we stand as a society when it comes to treating each other, it's a movie about kindness, the absence thereof, and its effects on people who need it. Some will love the movie, some will hate it, a lot just won't get it. Nothing to do with being smart, it's just a matter of experience with mental illness, which is played so brilliantly by Joaquin Phoenix in this movie."
3326,That lives in ignorance or not old enough to realize how some people suffer won't give this movie the best score. Its art and the acting is tremendously well played. Absolutely brilliant.
3327,Totally blown away. One of the all time greats!Takes art to a new level.
3328,"Phoenix was impressive in his impression of the Joker . He showed the Joker is in all of us and if we treat each other as badly as he was, Then We all can fall into the Dark . Heath Ledger would be very happy with this Performance and I hope they do the Middle Chapter of this Story , We all wanna really know how he got those Scars"
3329,"The best movie ever
I am not gonna see any movie again"
3330,This film is a total masterpiece Joaquin Phoenix acting is superb the hype of this movie is to be believed don't listen to those lefties they don't know what they're talking about
3331,"Joker. We all know who that character is even for the one who is a complete stranger to the Batman Universe. A psychopathic clown who takes everything as a comedy spreading evil and death as a wave of joke.This movie tells us the story of how a man who thought he was made to make people around him happy becomes the mean, evil murderer we all know. The story of a man whose life has been nothing but pain, loneliness and bullying. A man who got so sickened by what's going on around him, the evilness and cruelty of this world who takes him as a fool, he snaps and decides to take his revenge on it. This is the story of how Joker becomes Joker.Joaquin Phoenix is amazing in this role of a broken man who was already dead inside and chose to not care anymore. He is often very touching in his performance when he takes care of his sick mom or when he tries to figure out what makes him so different from the people around him. He made me feel a lot of sympathy for the character who I always considered as a heartless psychopath. I wept for him each time he was beaten up by cruel people and for the first time, he made me despise Thomas Wayne who until this movie has been pictured as a man caring for the people of Gotham.In this movie, he is the evil man, the selfish bully who considers the people on the fringe of society as a bunch of peasants and losers who are a burden to the city. That can be shocking but it's also refreshing.In fact this story shines a different light on why Joker becomes such an evil and merciless murderer. For him, he's not the one who is evil, it's the world around him and to take down that monster, he has to become a monster himself. He has to be that ruthless mean murderer to survive. Only for this, this movie should be praised and watched.I didn't realize this when I first reviewed this movie but a week after watching it and think it through with a cool head, I understand now. There are some scenes I don't understand yet especially the very last scene which still makes me feel like all of this was just a script running in his head. Maybe one day I will understand what it really means.Anyway that's a great movie and it deserves its high rating. I wouldn't be surprised if it reaps a lot of awards at the end of the year especially Joaquin Phoenix who is mesmerizing in this movie."
3332,"Oh my, after walking out of the theater, this is hands down, The most memorable film I've ever seen in my life, I loved it, I thought it was excellent. I recommend any Marvel fans or DC fans to see it if you haven't"
3333,"Joker is a unique, raw and special movie. It is a violent story that shows us the slow descent into madness of our protagonist, Arthur. The movie was incredibly hyped to what runs the year, however, unlike what usually happens with many movies that cause such excitement, this achievement exceed any expectation. This is a movie that definitely deserves any possible ovation to her. An incredible job. It seems fantastic to me to know that the director was able to carry out a work of such quality that it will simply become a milestone in the years to come; it is a unique story, without censorship which shows us the development of a protagonist in such a fluid, effective and fascinating way that we can come to sympathize with such madness, a violent madness, raw and emotional. These words can describe the essence of this film, capable of transmitting ideas and sensations of extreme power and power that nothing can equal.Much has been said about Joaquin's performance, and here I come to repeat the same thing, because he simply deserves it: It's incredible, it's perfect. This is the Joker that is capable of existing in this world, a performance as strong as human, a cruel and realistic touch gives enough support for us to understand the motivations of the character, who is not only a villain with a goal, or an idea, it is the explosion caused by the spark of madness. The acting is just sublime, and I'll say it at once; it's time for his Oscar.Incredible, fantastically dark, every minute of this film is a work of pure passion, effort and attention to detail, you can more than notice the incredible work that has been put into it. Everything is simply fascinating, the direction, the incredible script, the beautiful cinematography, the masterful performance, the deep soundtrack, the emotional scenes, the fluid development, and so on.Joker is a masterpiece. Psychological, powerful, crazy."
3334,"There is no film before let me go out of China mainland to see,JOKER is the first."
3335,"Best movie ever
I have no words leaving the cinema Great this movie was"
3336,Magical acting and magic behind the lens. Incredible movie making and mesmerizing performance.
3337,"Every little piece came together the right way to form a masterpiece! Joaquin Phoenix is so committed you even forget it's him (actors' goal) his acting, his dancing, his laughter, the voice and the mannerisms that made him Arthur, you can see he gave more that 100% and was careful and respectful about it. The score is out of this world! Every piece fitting for every moment and situation. Todd P. Blew my mind this time! What a talent!!!!"
3338,"Brilliant performance, awesome story, and a lil bit different end as we used to see than in an first version of Batman. Overall, I expect more than one Oscar for this masterpiece!"
3339,"Don't get me wrong i love marvel movies equally as much as dc movies but it's a nice refresher seeing a comic book movie take itself more seriously and not have a joke or one liner being said every other minute.
This movie can even be appreciated by non comic book movie lovers so if you're on the fence to see this movie due to growing tired of the usual formula i suggest giving this one a try.
Also don't listen to critics, you should watch this movie first and then formulate your own opinion as people will have different takes on this movie."
3340,First of all what an performance by Jaquine Phoenix. It's a one of a life time performance. Even clapped thousands time that won't be enough..If Oscar doesn't deserves him what else..Hats off to Todd Philips to direct this master piece..He has done a marvelous job.This should include in the list of God father and best ten movies ever created in Hollywood.
3341,I don't like to give 10s... and wow this movie deserved it...everyone in the cinema was silent like in church... the movie is mesmerizing...won't spoiled it...just watch it in cinema while this makes history.
3342,"Wow..fantabulous!!! This is by far the best Joker origin story that we've seen or read before. Joaquin is at his marvelous best. This movie actually makes you feel for the Joker and gives a rationale to all bad things 'The Joker' would do or become in the future. Hats off to Todd Phillips, I guess you can do nothing wrong with the director's hat on your head."
3343,As kid we loved the hero's... As adult we understand the villains
3344,"One of the best movies I have ever watched with Great acting, brilliant script and beautiful camera work. A real dive into Joker's story Which paints a picture we never really had and have always needed to understand his (joker's) why to the things he does."
3345,"I'm a pretty big fan of film, so it actually makes me feel uncomfortable to say something like this...That might've been the best movie I've ever seen."
3346,"I have seen this film 4 times in less than a week; The trailers had me wanting to see this from over a month ago and sometimes when a film is hyped up, it falls flat as you expect too much. On this occaision Joaquin Phoenix delivers an acting masterclass and one the greatest performances of all time. The film is very dark and worth watching even if you are not into the typical Batman/Joker Genre. One fantastic aspect of this film is trying to work out how how much of the film is ""real"" or just Arthur's imagination 1, Obviously Arthurs initial interactions with Sophie & No 2 , his inital interaction with Murray Franklin whilst in the audience..the rest is speculative 3 his interaction with a young Bruce at the Wayne family Home, 4 his meeting with Thomas Wayne at the theatre, 5 His appearance on the Murray Franklin show 6, The incident in the Police car after its hit by the ambulence.7, killing his mother in hopital (not one of the machines connected to her sounds an alarm that she is dead) did he smother her at home?..in fact was most of this film from Arthurs imagination whilst he is in the Asylum ...either way 10/10 and Joaquin Phoenix, amazing the Best Actor Oscar is yours"
3347,Simply put Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal as the Joker.
3348,"Heath ledger is just proud up there am sure...breathtaking performance definitely one of the best for this decade
WHAT A MOVIE WHAT A PERFORMANCE!"
3349,"A masterpiece from start to finish. Brilliant acting, cinematography, music and effects. Phoenix easily deserves an oscar. The thrilling feeling you get from the start, amplified by the constant background music to match the character were amazing. 10/10, insane how well a comic book character was brought to life as if the whole story actually existed."
3350,Omg ! I just saw it tonight and it was incredible. Best movie and best acting. I am waiting for the Oscar
3351,"Went into this movie not knowing what to expect. The hype surrounding it was overwhelming but it lived up to it. Brilliant case study surrounding Arthur Fleck's transition into the joker. What separates this from other superhero/villain movies is there is no suspension of disbelief. Every event and action could have plausibly taken place and that's what's so chilling about the movie. It really causes one to sit back and reflect on the nature of our society in creating the situations in the movie. Acting was brilliant, on par with Ledger. If you're inclined to watch any movie, I'd call this a must watch."
3352,"Wow, in the words of the song, I wasn't expecting that!I thought it would be like Batman but there is nothing comic book about this!I'm a mental health crisis nurse with 21 years experience and I'm sad to say that this is a true reflection of community care as a result of years of the Tory regime.We used to have case study videos at Uni but this tops them all.It is the perfect portrayal of a man with antisocial personality disorder who is consistently let down by the system and slips through the net with disastrous consequences.Everything about this film is genius.Mr Phoenix, words fail me, apart from he is one magnificently gifted individual. A breathtaking performance.The film is very very dark, very very depressing but so gripping and engaging.Ignore the hype about people walking out and the glorification of violence, it's nonsense. Watch the average horror movie and that will be much more bloody and violent than this and if anyone were to wear a clown's mask and try to copy then they are seriously in need of help.Don't watch this if you're expecting a typical comic book film, but if you're after an adult, mature and true to life character depiction, then watch this.Awesome."
3353,"This is the first Joker, in movies, who has it all. The unpredictable behaviour, theatrical moves, the insane laugh and kills just like that. They even made an origin movie and this guy is still a mystery, without a real name. And thank GOD, he did not become an anti-hero, a martyr or an idea. This is the JOKER, the one and only."
3354,"Easily became my favorite film of all time. When it was first announced that Joaquin Phoenix was going to play Joker a was a bit sceptical. But his performance was the best ever! Suited him perfectly with a great origin story movie for a villain. This is a story of how a man goes completely mad so if you expect to see full on savage Joker early on try to focus on Arthur Fleck and how his psychology changes with every punch he takes from society which is actually affects you as well. Todd Philips did a brilliant job, every shot of the film was breathtaking for me. Especially that first scene of Arthur with clown make up in the bathroom dancing. Definitely a must see film."
3355,Masterpiece perfectly done really brought me into the film I can see why the film isn't for everyone but give this a chance it really is that good
3356,This is the first movie I've ever seen twice in theaters. I usually don't like many movies because I usually don't find them engaging. I think this movie will go down in history and I can't stop thinking and talking about it! Everything about it was amazing!!
3357,"One of the best movies I ever seen, and the performance of Joaquin Phoenix it's one of the best ever."
3358,"This is the one that we missed for a long time. Joaquin's Joker is far more realistic then the rest of others. Directing and writing was brilliant, and colors of course.
We see a real man, from the real life, not a fictional universe. We always know Joker as a 'explosive' identity and now, we know how-what is it about. Thank you for such a great experience."
3359,"Wow, simply, Wow, after such a long time, so intense and outstanding acting. This is the best Joker ever... Years from now, it will be shown as a reference for new actors, the bar has been set, new levels achieved... well done J. Phoneix aka Joker... you rocked"
3360,Just go and watch...u wont regret it...the love for villian is growing among audiences...First THANOS and now JOKER..!
3361,"This film is a masterpiece.
The actors are amazing and the film is beutifully scripted."
3362,Nothing to do with the DC universe or even the joker. this movie is an insight into the mind of those so far down the social hierarchy that flipping the board is more rational than continuing to play.This is why mass shooters happen and watching it makes you understand something most struggle to under normal circumstances.when people say art has actual power its pieces like this that they are talking about
3363,One of the best comic book movies without being a comic book movie - brilliant character study - in the same style as taxi driver and king of comedy (a fitting 3 robert de niro list that) totally dark disturbing and deep with twists and turns and did that happen moments - defo one to watch multiple times
3364,"They got it. They've been able to show us darkness, madness, how a world can roll on people like Arthur. Great job, really. For 2 hours, i witnessed our world upside down... No one listens, no one cares and people just laugh. Until, you know... oh, then you will 😈"
3365,"I watched this movie just for joker acting, But J.Phoenix Proves above and beyond, This joker acting is more powerful, more beautiful, more accurate, more stylish, i love this joker acting very very very much, this is my fav acting"
3366,"Slow, Intense, Beautifully Canvassed! One of my favorite films if not the favorite film ever!"
3367,"They gave all emotion correctly. As a Joker fan, he was the best Joker I've ever seen."
3368,"So read comments prior to going. While I like movies, I only reserve the best movies to see in an actual theater. Was aware there was little to no special effects. But all the super positive reviews had me interested. I will say that during the movie, I bought into the character of the Joker. Joaquin was responsible for making this character.. so believably believable! His ability, to become the Joker, left me in awe of his acting. I was laughing and wondered if I should have been at certain points. Joaquin guided me into that warped mind and you understood the why. Loved it. And as the other commenters, he deserves the highest achievement award they have to offer! If you are squeamish about the reality of what the mind can achieve when damaged by life or physical injure... this probably is not for you highly recommend!"
3369,"It's a beautiful feeling you get when an art form goes deep inside you & tickles your heart.That's how I feel about this movie. It succeeds in giving you us audience a close up view of the world we live in & how it consistently wrongs us on many levels & ultimately has to pay a price for that.
This reminds me of a line from Crime & punishment, where it says, ""Crime is a protest to abnormality of the unorganized society"".
Joker shows us the mirror & it is natural to feel uncomfortable which is exactly what serves the purpose of a movie being made is to.Every 21st century fello"
3370,"I Was not expecting this movie to be such a masterpiece at every single level. It is truly what a movie should be: transporting you in the psyche of someone that is not you and make you relate to this person in some strange way. I'm speechless by how incredible it was, how I was taken by surprise...
We knew Phoenix to be a great actor for twisted vilain since Gladiator , but now it is going to be impossible to imagine the Joker without him playing it.
There is such depth in his acting, such a raw interpretation of mental illness. I'm just baffled how he is able to carry the movie and this level of intensity from the first minute to the last one on -almost- a stand alone performance. Very impressive performance that make some A list actors look like amateur who can only play themselves.
As an origin story for the joker, it brings so much depth to this DC character and thinking of the Joker now in previous Batman movie, make him become such an interesting vilain.As a final note, I loved how they twisted the birth of Batman and kept the previous work done with Batman begins coherent but slightly different.I thought before that DC was doing a poor job transposing their universe and character to the big screen (except for Batman Begins) but man, this movie changed my mind!
Congrats to all the team who work on making this move a reality, and a standing ovation to Mr Phoenix for granting us of such an acting performance.
Already a classic!"
3371,"Joker is not only the best film of 2019, but one of the best in the last decade in every way possible. The score, the cinematography, Phillips' vision and Phoenix's performance amount to an awe inspiring piece of art. It can be controversial, complicated, contorted but it is unmissable."
3372,"So, where do I begin.. the absolute brilliance of this movie was beyond my expectations. Joaquin Phoenix has betrayed a DC main Villain in such a breathtaking performance that with every laugh from start to finish and every comment he makes, really makes you see that journey of craziness he goes on! In the end we see him talking to his therapist and saying she would not understand the joke he was laughing at in his head, personally I believe that the whole movie was in his head and the only true scene of reality was at the end. In conclusion this movie from start to finish is brilliant and a fantastic psychological thriller! Deserves an Oscar in every way."
3373,"Lately, most movies have been adapted to be ""friendly"" for most viewers, lacking of depth, darkness and other ingredients. People and critics specified that movies (specially Disney-action movies) had to sacrifice some darkness and/or reality in order to make them user friendly for most audiences.
Then comes The Joker. It ignores any aspect of the ""audience friendly"" scheme and jumps into reality, darkness and all these aspects that we were so desperetely waiting for in other movies. This movie is graphic and crude in a lot of senses but thats what makes it so perfect. Todd Phillips didnt try to make it fit for all audiences. However, I've sene a lot of critics out there ripping into this film for being fuel for other things and for the strong content shown. Please decide what is it that you want because if you are looking for movies that ""fit"" most audiences, then you should be looking at a different franchise.
This is one of the best movies I've seen so far and I dont care what some critics are saying, you are definitely in for a treat if you decide to watch this movie."
3374,"Only One word Oscar
What an movie best movie in decades 80s are back and baground sounds are lifting up the movie grate direction with cinematography Phoenix has given best performance yet."
3375,"I went into this film with no expectations, struggling to believe anybody could top Heath Ledgers performance.Mesmerising, dark, thrilling, twisted, raw. Phoenixs portrayal became the best I've ever seen and was such a believable insight into the life of the Joker.Oscar worthy, time for an award!"
3376,"Great moview and chilling performance. Well worth a watch, or 2...or 3...!!!"
3377,"The best joker ever !!! Marvel you loose the movie battle
DC you have one of the best movies in the history !!!!! Joaquín Phoenix thanks for this amazing performance !!!!!!"
3378,"This movie wasn't what I expected, but I mean that in the best way possible. It was darker, grittier, and had a real feel to it that is unparalleled in comic book movies. The story was relevant to current times with themes of societal discord and mental health issues throughout. It made the Joker more than a character but a believable being that could live down the street, ride your bus, or work in your city. You travel with him down a dark hole until he reaches the point you'd expect in this scenario, yet still I found it unpredictable. This is a must see for any fan and truly the best Joker there has ever been. The story with minor changes could have even been taken out of Gotham with the main character being any person, and the movie would have still been outstanding in its own right. Do yourselves a favor and go see this movie!"
3379,"Joker. Where do I even begin. Never expected a comic book movie to talk about such serious issues that we as a human race face today. Mental illness, social economic disparity, social service funding being cut and how mental illness should be treated. And the best part about Joker is that it never takes a stance to position on these issues, all it does is show us what it's like and holds a mirror up. And that's it. It leaves so many things open ended for the audience to perceive. It's a dark, moody psychodrama which is elevated through Joaquin's performance, Lawrence sher's cinematography and Hildur guðnadóttir's haunting score. Tod Phillips also directed and wrote the film very well. The writing did drop in quality in some scenes during the third act which was one of my only flaws I had, but I'm not getting into spoilers. Watching Joker is an surreal, out of body experience. Watching some scenes for example the 'bathroom dance' is like being in a hypnotic trance. And these are just my thoughts on the film. Go watch joker. Support risky films like this that have something to say."
3380,"Well, what can I say, most of the reviews are already saying it! This film is really strong & very deep into the character, Joaquin plays the part much better than Nicholson & Ledger in my opinion. I have always been an avid Batman fan growing up with Keaton back in 1989, loved Bales performance too. This however takes in a whole new approach following the Joker story. You will not be disappointed. I would definitely pay to see this all over again. 10/10"
3381,The best film I've seen in a long time. Hats off to Phoenix the best joker by far dont get me wrong respect to heath ledger but Phoenix beats him. Really tells the story of how Arthur became joker and quite sad if I may say. Overall a spectacular film if I could give this a 11 out of 10 I would.
3382,"Something i haven't experienced so far, an extra outstanding acting and film as a whole is stunningly amazing work."
3383,"Joker is possibly one of the greatest movies ever made and it's most definitely my favorite movie of all time. The cinematography was lovely, the character development was beautifully done, Phoenix's performance was easily one of the best performances I have ever witnessed, and the film score was really engaging. The movie also depicts mental illness wonderfully. If you haven't watched it yet, you are surely missing out. Don't waste your time and go watch it."
3384,"What a film, definitely believe the hype and go watch this!"
3385,"This film is nothing but a cinematic masterpiece. Very depressing, artsy and gritty. You feel like you're being dragged through the downward spiral of his life. You feel the emotions he's going though and you cringe and feel uncomfortable at almost every turn. The gore/action isn't overwhelming...it's done in just the right places, making it even more shocking. As someone who is bored of ""superhero movies"" and their similar storyline and hour or so of fighting...this my friends is a breath of beautiful fresh air. Joaquin Phoenix...GIVE THE MAN AN AWARD...He is a living and breathing work of art. I now understand why this film got a standing ovation. It's the film of the year, if not the best film of all time."
3386,"I don't know how any critic could rate this movie as bad. I've read more bad reviews than good. Did they see a different movie to me? I was entranced. The incredible cinematography combined with fantastic music and a nuanced script made it a very good movie, but... The performance by Phoenix... Well that just elevated a great movie into a masterpiece of cinema. This movie is the reason I love movies. The richness of character combined with its mystery of humanity mixed with fantastic imagery and direction. Well I can't stop thinking how good this was. If you love cimema, watch this. It's simply brilliant..."
3387,"As a student of psychology, Joker has found a way to see the slow decay of a individual suffering from psychosis, psychotic tendencies, narcissism, the need to belong, and finding pleasure in the darkest of places.
This movie isn't for everyone. It is very dark. There isn't a happy ending. Yet the acting and story-line can be appreciated for the moving story it portrays. As the Joker portrays one with a severe mental illness, this movie at least offers insight on the real struggles that exist in those with mental health problems, while still offering a masterful way to depict the origin story of the world's greatest super villain.
It's a film that has a story so unique that you can't look away, a story whose acting is only seen in the greatest films of all time. It is unlike any other film I can remember."
3388,"The movie is sad and depressing for sure. However, it shows how the poor and mentally ill can be turned into criminals. In addition, shows how capitalism in poor societies can lead to a dangerous society thats full of villians."
3389,"This film is magnificent. It is disturbing, suspenseful and original- from the same director as the ""Hangover"" movies. Todd Phillips proves his cinematic skill with this dark and provoking thriller/character study. From the retro Warner Bros. logo at the beginning to the vintage ""The End"" title card at the chilling conclusion, ""Joker"" will no doubt affect the viewer in one way or another. Of course, it would be absurd to not attribute part of this film's excellence to Joaquin Phoenix's incredible performance. One half terrifying, one half sympathy-evoking, and 100% believable, Phoenix delivers more than the audience could have ever asked for. The entire film is cemented by the eerie soundtrack, composed by Hildur Guðnadóttir. This Joker is unlike any of its predecessors, and will likely remain unrivalled for years to come."
3390,"This is raw meterial, that really plays with you emotions and morality. It litteraly give you the creeps. I find it Hard to describe it, so very disturbing yet so fascinating. Joaquin is absolutely amazing, never have i ever believed a caracter a much as I did when i watched him as The Joker. So convincing and comepelling just give him an Oscar allready."
3391,"You'll laugh uncomfortably, Just like Joker!
What a brilliant movie! Very well made dark Interpretation of mental illness. Cinematography, film score and direction are brilliant. Joaquin Phoenix Does an outstanding performance. Definitely Oscar worth."
3392,"If you come into this movie with MCU expectations this will be a difficult watch for you. There's a certain level of fantasy that has been excepted as norm in modern day comic book films. Joker flips that on its head. It's real, and I mean really real! It deals with some very deep themes that are uncomfortable to deal with but I think that's the point, it's a mirror of our society. This is not some special effects laden anti-hero flick, rather, this is a character study of the devolution of a man that society has failed on every level. Be prepared."
3393,"If there was a way to tell a story of a mad man who is the mortal enemy of Gotham's Dark Knight... This was it.
How Joker came about, how the world molded him to becoming THE JOKER of Gotham.. This love executed the story well. Joaquin Phoenix was and is the perfect actor for this particular Joker. Truly marvellous acting. Smart, creative plot. Glorious movie. Thank you!!!!"
3394,"First of all I must say, this film can be understood as a basic mathematic equation for the fanatics of Martin Scorsese. Adding The King of Comedy + Taxi Driver + Cape Fear, and multiplying it all to a fully creative screenplay on a previously existing character = Joker. I believe I've never witnessed such an authentic way of stealing the show as Joaquin Phoenix's performance under Todd Philipps direction. Joaquin is easily one of the best actors of his generation. He chews the character, eats it, spits it, then chews it again. He fully understand the complexities of the villain and portrays it in an utterly unique manner. This joker should not be compared with Ledger's (under Nolan). They are totally different phases of a character that was developed in two completely distinct stories and contexts. I can't say Phoenix surprised me, but that's not a bad thing. In fact, I have such an awareness of his abilities I knew he would nail it right on the spot. He drives the story in a fantastic way. You laugh, even when you should'nt, which is basically, the primary characteristic of Fleck. Senses of fear, danger and chaos are properly driven and exploited. I should say I'm definitively surprised by Philipps's approach. Based on his previous work such as the ""Hangover"" trilogy and other films such as War Dogs, I must say he really did his best on this flick. Without a doubt, this is his peak so far and I trust he'll only work to surpass such a movie. Within other aspects, the use of colour is sublime, a vintage-tone and an impressive wardrobe selection for the man himself, Arthur. Photography is truly magnificent. Music is incredibly reliable for the themes portrayed. The dark and gloomy cello brings the film a truly magnificent aspect to define the traumatic personality and experiencies the joker lives. On other aspects, secondary characters such as Penny, Murray, Sophie and Arthur's work partners are really important for sustaining the story. Subplots are unique and the main storyline was accurate enough to explain in a vivid manner the metamorphosis of Fleck, as well as defying on a smaller scale the origins of the hero, Batman. Length of the film is perfectly measured, pacing is precise and it really goes along fast. You won't even realize 2 hours have past and then, you'll know what I mean. Overall, I believe Phoenix, Philipps and the score are the aspects that influenced me with such a positive response. Definitively a must watch, and surely, an Academy contender for the three characteristics I believe are under the spotlight; Main Actor, Best Director/Script and Best Original Score (although there are musical pieces which were previously written). In conclusion, flaws are not something I'd relate with this film. 10/10 for me."
3395,"Joker is an excellent character study of a man who is descending into a dark madness. It's central theme of how society treats the mentally ill is very strong and well done, and full props must be given to Joaquin Phoenix for his excellent performance.It's not a perfect film though. It borrows heavily from other sources, and the themes go deep, but not as deep as they maybe could have. Also, the Joker character at the end didn't quite feel right as the movie never took him past angry personal revenge killings to become the outright and indiscriminate psychopath that he is supposed to be.If you only watch comic book films then this will seem truly mind blowing, but for seasoned cinephiles, it's been done better in other movies. Still, that doesn't take away from what is maybe not a masterpiece, but a very good film - and there's nothing wrong with being a very good film."
3396,Overall a great movie with an amazing direction but what really need to be mentioned is the brilliant performance by Joaquin Phoenix
3397,"Never would I had thought I'd sympathize and even feel sorry for the man that would become the joker. Heartbreaking, unsettling, disturbing, pity, remorse. I felt all that throughout the film as I kept rooting for Arthur to find happiness even if I knew the end result. You don't need to be a batman or comic fan to appreciate this movie.And forget the media for focusing so much on how this ""glorifies"" violence. It wasn't even that violent. There are bigger issues it raises like rich vs poor, mental/physical abuse, and of course, mental illness. I left thinking on all those, in fact feeling more sympathetic for those like Arthur. And I'm sure there are ppl out there struggling like him, even without the mental baggage. The media should be praising this film."
3398,"The best thing about this movie is how we see the world through Arther Fleck's eyes (who will transform psychologically to become Joker) and not through a narrator's perspective. That alone makes this movie so unique coz it's the first time that is done with a character that is so villainous and so popular like Joker.
No need to speak about how great Joaquin Phoenix's performance is. It's an Oscar worthy in my opinion. It's so hard - if not impossible to top him this year.
The director did a tremendous job to deliver the darkness and grittiness of Gotham City in a deep touching way. That makes you get sucked into that world. Photography is another spectacular aspect of this movie.
I'd give it more than 10 🌟 s if that was an option."
3399,"Intense, unnerving film that caused real dialogue between myself and the person I saw the film with. Don't quite understand the controversy surrounding it and I admit it won't be a film that everyone will love (has a pace that some may consider slow). Really interesting character study that Phoenix absolutely nails. I understand it won't happen, but would love to see more Gotham villains get this type of standalone origin film treatment. Love that Gotham was utilized as more than just the backdrop."
3400,If you don't give this movie a 10/10 then you're crazy and you don't have any taste in movie and i would prefer you watch Bollywood and some Korean movies and get out of my hollywood legends movies
3401,"Is one of the best movies ever.Is the best character development ever made.
Joker is a masterpiece"
3402,"I will attempt to provide a spoiler free opinion.. here it is.Joker is for all intents and purposea a masterpiece. I went in with very high expectations but I was not prepared for this.
In the past years I saw msnu PC movies, superhero movies and overall movies without soul that were vrry highly regarded, but this one here has all I was missing.
Cinematography is exceptional, I saw at least 4-5 scenes that were absolutly suberb, in acting and imaging. Those type of scenes that you rembember and have goosebumps over.
Sound, while not the best or memorable (at least not at first watch) as were The Fountain, Requiem for a Dream and others, it is still top notch and more important were perfectly match with what I was seeing.
Last and clearly not least, Joaquin Pheonix....I read and seen quite a bit before going in ""ohhh people are walking out of the movie or it is bad...not PC enough, apolitical. ...etc"" all those messages are from critics that honestly follow a crooked agenda. My truth is I saw acting like I did not see for a loooong time. The descent inyo madness is palpable, relatable and real. Mr. Pheonix is incredible, suberb, breathtaking! An Oscar performance and while I gave it a 10 to counter this lowlifes agenda spewers the movie is a strong 9.Go watch this, I am sure you will have a great experience. One of the few movies that deserves your money and time"
3403,"Hold right there. And drop all your superheroes preconceptions. This is not a summer dumb fun action super villain movie. It's something else.A reinterpretation of Joker. And it's harrowing in its grittiness and potential. You will be there in the streets of Gotham, a Gotham that feels more real than any other fictional city on screen. Because little does it matter where the events happen on screen. This Joker can be anyone, anywhere.A perfect score in movie means more than just a great story. For me it means the character, the performance, the build-up. And all of them are beautifully done. Especially the build-up. Maybe some will think it's too slow, but I was glued to the screen the whole time.Of course, I still have some complaints, but most of them are because of my view on the Joker. As the classic Joker, I think Heath Ledger is still the best but he was helped by the script. The Joker's background should not be known, that's what makes the character so unpredictable.But Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is the people's hero, a deranged hero for a deranged society."
3404,"Joker was one of the best movies I have seen in a long, long time: dark, tense and profoundly sad. I spent the bulk of my time while watching this film either on the edge of tears or in a state of pre-panic. The cinematography was gorgeous, the soundtrack amazing, and the acting was award-worthy. Not at all what I expected... and I am grateful for that."
3405,"I didn't know what to expect for a stand alone joker Origin story. What I got was one of the great films of the 21st century. Joaquin Phoenix delivers one of the greatest performances ever. Chilling to the bone. Ledger was great, Phoenix dwarfs greatness. Todd Phillips has done a terrific job and enlightening us on just how crazy the joker really is."
3406,GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!! Went to see it twice since it released and I'll probably go see it again. I was completely immersed in this story and the character. It's easily one of the best movies ever made and some of the best acting ever done. My friends and I couldn't stop speaking about it after seeing it.
3407,"This film is so multi layered. 1st off it's amazing. The acting is incredible. Joaquin Phoenix is really tremendous in this role. You watch him slowly ratchet up his performance as the movie goes along and you watch his character slip slowly into madness and transform into The Joker. This movie is definitely a slow build. But, if you stick with it and watch him change as the movie goes on, there is plenty to keep you watching. The biggest surprise for me is Todd Phillips. If you told me the guy who directed The Hangover movies could direct something so artistic and gritty, I would have told you you're crazy. The direction is really top notch. Go see this movie. It's dark, it's a bit slow, and at times it's a bit disturbing, but it is REALLY compelling. 9.5 out of 10"
3408,"Joker is a Taxi Driver type moment for the Comicbook movie genre its just as nuanced just as controversial and just as dark, violent and dirty as Martin Scorsese's 1976 masterpiece, it also has deep deep threads linking it to a whole host of other mid to late 70's and early 80's classics like Friedkins The French Connection or another Scorsese classic The King Of Comedy its abit on the nose with some of its influences but it never takes away from the overall originality of Phoenix's performance or the movie in general it feels more like Todd Phillips paying respects to a wonderfully provocative and risky era in filmmaking, Todd Phillips is really masterful and mature with the camera here his direction is steady when needed and slightly more chaotic in chase sequences like William Friedkin with his chase scenes in The French Connection, Phillip's use of the close up here is much appreciated to so you can see and feel every facset of what is an absolutely riveting performance from Joaquin Phoenix he channels so much energy into Arthur so much so Phoenix vanishes for 2 hours and it's only when the credits role you realise he was acting its astonishing work well worthy of an Oscar nomination if not a win although knowing the hacks over at the Academy they will no doubt buckle under the pressure of media outrage and deny him. From the powerful score by Hildur Guðnadóttir to the wonderfully framed and gorgeous Cinematography by Lawrence Sher Joker is a rare treat not often seen in cinema today yet alone in the Comicbook movie genre it's a fantastic movie and it should be seen by as many people as possible so we can get more challenging and nuanced films in what is such a rich and deep universe. Joker is The Taxi Driver of the Comicbook Movie its bold, dark and controversial and we need more movies like it. 10/10 A Masterpiece."
3409,This whole movie is just a tutorial on how to win an oscar !!!
3410,"There are many things that can be said about this movie, and going in there was a lot of talk about social commentary and how the movie will spark a violent event, but not one thing came across as something trying to trigger someone into acting out against society. It's just a movie, and a great one at that. I don't need people deciding my morals and movies don't either, it's just for entertainment, and this just that, but in a very uncomfortable way. I have never seen someone carry a movie in such a way that Joaquin Phoenix did. The way he moved, the way he held himself, to the way he contorts his body in an visibly painful way. It just screams commitment and pure talent. I just wish it wasn't a standalone film. The violence and gore in the movie is only in like 4 scenes but with such surprise and effect that those few scenes are burned into your memory. Robert Dinero gave a wonderful take on being a daily night time show host, and really is the best performance in a long time for him. This movie was truly uncomfortable, emotional, and really showed every layer of joker that really was never shown before. Every part of the movie slowly progressed Arthur Fleck into the joker, and if any part was removed, then the joker wouldn't have made any sense. It just shows how perfectly done the character arch of Joker was. I don't think there will ever be a movie with such respect to detail to the chain of events that led to his final form as Joker."
3411,"The Joker is not a comic book movie, but rather a master class in character study. The film follows your lead Arthur Fleck or ""The Joker"". You're told the story through his eyes, and through this lens it is easy to find Arthur extremely sympathetic. Jaoquin Phoenix's portrayal, coupled with Todd Phillip's writing had made for a character who holds onto your attention the whole film. There wasn't a moment of the film I wasn't in awe, when the score would slowly creep in to give you chills over a scene that was previously completely silent, or still shots of hallways, and stair cases as Arthur is alone in frame, just to give you a gripping sense of loneliness throughout the film. Though the plot can be fairly predictable, it's how those moments play out that are surprising. You feel like you know something will happen one way and it does happen never in the way you feel it will though. The script can often times be dull for some, but to me I saw these moments as cold, hard bits that look into Arthur's psychy. Like a scene in which Arthur is in a comedy club and doesn't get what's funny and what's not so he just laughs, none of the jokes are really funny, but they're supposed to be things we know are supposed to be funny so we see that Arthur doesn't understand. There are other jokes that aren't laugh out loud hilarious, but are just funny enough to get you to think they are, and then immediately, a like of dialogue comes in to make you feel bad about laughing about that.The best things I can say about this film can't be said without spoiling it, all I can say is that it is a cold, gritty horror film about the horrors of the human psyche that'll leave you uncomfortable towards the end, with many questions about yourself left in your head after just one viewing."
3412,Acting is insane! Story is brilliant. No doubt this is my favourite film by far
3413,"Very intense!!! Superb acting!! If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get an Oscar for this, I'll never watch them again!!! A definite must see movie!!!"
3414,"I watched the movie on 2nd October . I was so impressed by Joaquin performance and the way he has lost a significant weight in order to suit into the movie . He studied some aspects of psychiatry to lear how to do an abnormal laughter which is really challenging ! I believe he is the best who performed the joker and I am so far astonished by the high level he has reached in acting and doing a drama . The movie is excellent , it gets more exciting as you watch it and you will be captured by the character . Performance , Directing and scenario all 10/10 . Bravo"
3415,"Movie of the year, 100%! For a movie called ""Joker"" you don't want Arthur to snap at the begging but when he does, it's brutal, insane and fun! Joaquin Phoenix MUST get an Oscar for this!"
3416,"The perfect film. Simply perfect, the absolute beautiful combination of realistic and ridiculous, the messages throughout underlying the whole film kept my brain whirring but it was just wonderful to sit back and watch. There was not a single moment I was looking at my watch or thinking about anything else. I will watch this again and again and again and I am certain it will be one of my top 5. Beautiful all round, I am already excited to watch it again!"
3417,"I just saw it and I can't help thinking of JOKER'S LAUGHING,which is very impressive.
Best acting! The violin music is very outstanding ...
Everyone one should learn something from this incredible film,that we should pay attention to mental healthy as well as not to bully others.
I definitely recommend this movie.Besides I expect JOKER would obtain several OSCAR AWARDS!!!Especially the best actor!!
There is no doubt that Joaquin deserves an OSCAR 🤡
I reckon that the JOKER has become a symbol of madness,craziness,chaos."
3418,"This is the movie of the year if not the decade! A masterful directing from Todd Phillips, the photography, the music are also outstanding.
But what is breathtaking, is Joaquin Phoenix's Joker. He has been an outstanding actor worth at least an Oscar already (for The Gladiator, The Master, Inherent Vice and so on). But his Joker will be taught in film schools. You don't see such a performance too often or never see one.
On the other hand, about the film, it's a standalone movie but if you know the Batman Universe you understand small details better.
If you want to see one film this year this should be the one (and The Irishman, of course :-) )."
3419,"Where do we begin? Well, it begins as you might expect. The teaser trailer for Joker drops and I am instantly captured - it is one of the best trailers I have ever seen. My anticipation is sky high, and every day closer to the release raises it higher. Just a week or so before the opening day, criticism and controversy starts to surround this film. It encourages a certain type of violent acts that are frequent across America. It symbolises it and sends the wrong message. Some argue against this - some argue for it. Nevertheless, being the scared, paranoid, creature that I am, I begin to have second thoughts about the upcoming premiere. Nonetheless, I attend the opening night. In the back of my head I have all these thoughts about what could go wrong. I know stuff has happened before, I know about the controversy surrounding this film, but it wipes off easily. Until an unidentified man places an unidentified bag in the aisle right next to me. The next two hours I spent maybe just as afraid as I have ever been before.Joker is without a doubt a disputed and controversial film. It is horrifying and psychologically unhinging, to the point where I even question If this is really why I go to the cinema - I don't go to the movies to be scared to return. Whether it was circumstances (it probably was, in addition to my paranoid self) or the movie itself that caused my hysteria, you cannot take away from this film the way it impacts you.Todd Philips, in combination with a spectacular Joaquin Phoenix, manages to put you inside the mind of a mentally ill, abused, lonely man, and show how society treats such a person. What is truly sensational, and overwhelmingly mind-terrorising, is how we also get to see a first person reaction to those circumstances. The movie takes you deep inside the head of the Joker, and it is not a pretty place to be. Moreover, by showing Arthur Fleck's descend to madness, they also show just how bad it can get in a country like America. One might see it as a black mirror, reflecting on America and the American society, showing its darkest colours.As a whole, Joker works brilliantly as a dark ""comedy"", as to quote the man in question. Every performance is spot on, particularly from the already mentioned Phoenix, though also from De Niro, who seems to be having his best year in a long time. Still, the score is by far the most impressive thing about it - If Hildur Guðnadóttir does not win the Oscar, I'm boycotting.Apart from some over exposition, Joker is an almost flawless cinematic piece. The only inquiry that remains, is if it crosses the border of being what it speaks against. After writing this review, and having cooled down from the experience, I can say now, from my perspective, that it doesn't. Joker is the film that America wants to hide from."
3420,"This was very reminiscent of Taxi Driver. The time place and story are very astonishing. It was very atmospheric on many levels. It differs from marvel movies because it steps out of superhero agenda. This is what other ""reviewers"" are probably bashing the film for. It is simply the best DC movie I've seen so far. Joaquin's portrayal of the Joker character is unique and very well formed and not as mysterious as previous Jokers."
3421,The story is perfect and touching. The joker acting is really amazing.
3422,Joaquin Phoenix gives the best interpretation of the character we've ever seen
3423,Beautiful psychological thriller !! Glad reviewers on this site have some sense of what a good movie is !!
3424,"I just went to my local movie theater and saw Joker and can honestly say that it is one of the best movies that I've seen this year, and one of the best dramas and performances I've seen in a long time. Joaquin Phoenix truly shines and gives an oscar-worthy performance. As I was walking out I happen to see two police officers as well as a sign that said that if you wore Joker mask or put on face paint that you would be escorted out. I do not understand why people think that this movie is going to cause people to commit violent Acts or that they would even wear face paint or masks after the first showing of the first show Thursday at midnight. This movie is about Mental Health, not violence and people need to stop trying to strike fear into people because they are doing exactly what causes Arthur Fleck to become unhinged in this film. They're no better than the people who mistreat this man in the film.This movie is about mental health in the sense that the main character is mentally unstable. He regularly goes to counseling sessions and keeps up with medication. The thing that drives him towards violence is the world around him. As you heard from the trailer and you'll hear in the movie, Arthur Fleck says that his mother told him that he was made to bring joy and happiness to people in the world, and he genuinely tries to do that through the art of clown, but with the way people are nobody can see that or understand that that is how he is trying to convey joy and love to the world, but the world does not want to convey joy and love and kindness back. Instead they beat down a man who is already been beaten down, and caused him to finally snap and believe that violence was the only answer, since it seemed to be the only thing that brought joy to people around him. He found a way to bring joy and happiness of the world just as his mother had told him he was put on this Earth to do.Arthur says that he used to think his life is a tragedy but realized it was a comedy. This movie is incredibly tragic. When we cut funding for people who desperately need it to get counseling, and to feel better and understand themselves and their illness there are bound to be some problems. We all say that we want everybody to keep up a happy veneer and pretend to be happy for the sake of everybody else that nobody is sad, and this movie shows what that idea can do to people. It is not possible to be happy every single day of your life and most the time it's impossible to keep up the veneer that everything is great and you are happy to the people around you. If they cared they would know and understand when you are feeling down or unstable and come to you to help you or at least try to get you some help. Nobody comes to Arthur to help him in his time of need and he finds a solution by himself, which is not to say a acceptable or good solution, but a solution none the less. A solution that brings him joy and happiness that he should have never had to have picked in the first place. Thomas Wayne is the true villain in this movie, not Arthur Fleck. Arthur Fleck had no control of what people were going to do, or honestly what he was even going to do because, and I'm going to emphasize this again, he is mentally unstable and not able to make sound and sane decisions by himself in without help.This movie is a rally cry to show people that there are people who are unstable and in pain all around them, we are just too blind to see them and do not want or care to do anything about it."
3425,"Amazing, gorgeous, simple,violent, believeble, masterpiece, pure, crazy, mindblowing."
3426,"One line that stuck with me was ""The worst part of having a mental illness is that people expect you to behave like you don't.""What impressed me about this movie was how accurately it portrayed mental illness and the struggle that mentally ill people go through. What blew my mind was Joaquin Phoenix's Oscar worthy performance. A challenging role, to say the least, that he performed legendarely.Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is an Icon."
3427,"Everyone who says it's bad can suck your mom.
So good
So good
So good"
3428,"Thanks to it premiering on the festival circuit and all of the recent discourse surrounding its content, Joker is a film that feels as if it has been out for ages when in fact it's only just been released this weekend. My anticipation for its release was already sky-high but had only been heightened by the media claiming it to be a dangerous film to release to the public and the rise in security presence at recent premiere screenings in America however, does the film even deserve all the discourse it's seen before its release?Having been disregarded by society, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a clown-for-hire, descends into a life of crime and infamy.There's a deeply unsettling sense of impending violence that flows throughout Joker from start to finish, Arthur's descent towards a life of crime depicted in incredibly visceral fashion. It's a ticking time-bomb of a film that hones in on the mental state of its titular character and how he's viewed by society, Todd Phillips and Scott Silver not holding back in making Gotham a horrible place for Arthur to reside.The production design ensures Gotham feels very much a character playing a part in Arthur's downward spiral, as does Lawrence Sher's glum cinematography and Hildur Guðnadóttir's minimal yet rather haunting score.Joker is elevated to great heights by a mesmerisingly magnetic lead performance from Joaquin Phoenix, who yet again showcases why he is arguably the best actor working today with a performance for the ages. It's such a devastatingly beautiful performance that's both hard to watch at times yet hard to take your eyes off, Phoenix surely the man to beat come awards season.He's certainly the main attraction on show in Joker but he's dealt some stellar support from the likes of Robert De Niro, embracing the cheesy flair of his character, and Zazie Beetz, offering Arthur a glimmer of hope in his otherwise downbeat life.Joker really is a stunning character study from Todd Phillips, unflinching in its approach and deeply unsettling in its execution, the performance from Joaquin Phoenix in particular making it a film that will certainly leave a lasting impression."
3429,"Absolutely riveting, jaw dropping and quite simply put... a masterpiece.
Joaquin Phoenix IS the Joker!
He needs an oscar for this... now"
3430,"First i love joker and i was very annoyed when i saw DC trying to make an iconic version of him after ledger , but this Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is something else..
So deep and almost perfect, this movie showed us a new joker and they did it perfectly , if u r interested in comics or not you will love this movie.. btw it's my first and last review"
3431,"It is the best movie of thd year , no doubt. The acting , the music , the cinematography , all goes to the extreme."
3432,Joaquin is superb. Deserves the Oscar for this performance
3433,A masterpiece!! Totality! Make is to not bully someone!
3434,"This movie is absolutely awesome , what an acting by Joaquin Phoenix!"
3435,"What a solid stuff,from acting to direction,and especially from Joaquin and Todd philips"
3436,"First of all, please do not compare Joaquin Phoenix's Joker with Heath Ledger's Joker. We are lucky to see two actors playing a very difficult character of Joker brilliantly in their own ways. They are both so good, they are both legends!In terms of movie, Joker origin story is something very new and very much needed. It has always been emphasized in the DC world that Gotham was irredeemable, that the people were so corrupted that the city was beyond saving. But the reason behind it was never shown. The story has always been told from Batman's point of view. This storytelling is so brilliant, you really sympathize and understand why Joker is what it is. If you see Dark Knight just after this, Joker's love for chaos will make total sense.It's good to see such a realistic cinema with characters having so much depth. The level of acting and movie making is legendary. Hats off!Yes the hype is real. Do not miss this masterpiece."
3437,Joaquin Phoenix in this might just be better than Heath Ledger.
3438,I dont wanna say too much things but that movie was just incredible.. I cant find words to explain how Joaquin Phoenix acted perfectly.. Oscar goes to him ! Thanks for that amazing movie..
3439,"I watched Joker on IMAX yesterday sitting on the the best seats which means that I already known that this movie is gonna be amazing. How? Well, I watched the Master months ago which the only thing that in my eyes was well to watch, it was the Phoenix's acting in this movie.
This ensured me about his acting skills and his integrity as an actor that this movie is gonna be amazing. I was expecting something as good as this Joker, which it has honestly gone over my expectations. Firstly, Todd Phillips has done a masterpiece. Congratulations to him. He can boast anyone with this perfect directing of his. It is clear enough from the movie that he did not consent to any bad impression, any bad part that could be showing this movie as an ordinary film throughout the world. He targeted his efforts to create a perfect movie, to be a part of history. I believe he has achieved it already.
Secondly, the music of this movie just fits the mood and angles of the movie. This is one of the most important and common parts of any amazing movie. For Example, Interception would never be The Interception without Hans Zimmer making the music. Well in this movie, also I have seen great moves from a composer, which it definitely helped me to feel the emotions of such complex character (Joker), plot and the mood of each scene of the film. It is a well done composing by Hildur Guðnadóttir. She deserves some great awards for her art in this film.Thirdly, the script and plot of the story which makes the audience to be fully concentrated on the character of Joker and his feelings. It is more dramatic than a ""DC"" or a ""comic"" movie. This plot answers many questions about Joker's originality. The plot is amazing as well in which it keeps you guessing about the future scenes. Also, the fact that even after the film, it keeps you thinking about the theory after the ending and the moral of the story, makes this work of art, a special work of art.Fourthly, the coloring of the movie, the filmmaking, the screen display, the camera shots, the sounds, the special effect, the lighting and etc. All of them has don't the best they could do and make a stunning result. There is nothing say about them else than admiring the whole crew for bringing such an art to our eyes.
Lastly, The ACTING. For me, personally, I don't like a slow going plot. A smooth story telling plot is super boring for me. But, for this movie, the only and only thing that keeps me watching the movie without blinking is Joaquin Phoenix. His acting is just WOW! The most impressive thing about this movie, the most significant thing that make the movie, looks realistic is his indubitable, indisputably acting. His acting is phenomenal. For me it's just a question, HOW DID HE DO THAT??!! I can never act like that. It is super difficult to even understand the Joker's character. How did he act like that?! I believe This is his best roll ever, and one of the best actings ever. (At least in top 5) He deserves to get the best awards for his roll in this movie, and he is definitely comparable with Heath Ledger. His acting is full of emotions, filled with unreleased anger, full of simplicity and humanity, filled with oppression, his laughs are with meaning, his eyes are full of un dropped tears and his chest is full of unspoken words. He doesn't understand the people. He relies on their humanity, he trusts them and yet, he gets beaten by them, he gets betrayed and he gets suffocated. He has never found Love he always wanted. Everyone, disrespected him and manipulated him through his life. He has seen insincerity hurting him to his bones. And, when he gets to the top, when he finds his way to feel better, to be recognized, you can still see that he is confused and new to this stage of life. This is just perfect. One of the best actors of all time, I would name him.The moral of the movie is so deep and it is full of unfortunate and painful truths. It's an unreal but at the same time real tragedy.This movie can change a lot of people's mindset in different countries. If you have seen this film, please stop judging and discriminating other people. If you have not, you are missing a great masterpiece! Enjoy!"
3440,"I was never overly hyped for this movie, though the expectations after seeing the first trailer were high. After seeing it at the opening day, it definitely surpassed any expectations I had. Yes, the title might be read and experienced as the Taxi Driver of 21st century. But at the same time it is much, much more. The best Joker movie that could have been made, dark, enthralling, moody, making you constantly uncomfortable. Great acting from Joaquin Phoenix, total embodiment of the loneliness, fragmentation and psychosis of the character and its slow turning into the clown prince of crime. By far the best movie based on comic book material and characters that has been ever made, surpassing what Nolan did in his trilogy. Though Ledger was great in the Dark Knight, the one that truly captures the essence and psychology of the Joker is this performance of Phoenix. A must seen movie, whereas the controversy around the themes of violence, anarchy and disputing of the existing order and paradigm in society should not be something that stops any true cinema lover from seeing this - go and experience for yourself a new landmark in the transfer of the comic books material to the medium of the 7th art. A true masterpiece of modern cinema."
3441,"This movie was beyond phenomenal. The complexity of the charectar itself was played so well and adding the dysfunctional society making the iconic laugh as a part of his illness was beyond genuis. If you already have watched Joker, then you already know the best scene was when Joker was on the Murray show! It was incredible!"
3442,"This movie is soo good with brilliant acting, music and cinematography... This movie is a perfect piece of work. First 20 minutes alone deserves an Oscar."
3443,"Joaquin Phoenix has an outstanding performance! Oscar should come to him this year. Great movie, dramatic and haunting development of a well known character, a psychological overview of an ""unseen"" ill man in a crazy society and the consequences that comes from this. A must see definitely! There is sadness, you'll want to cry for him, for the Joker, for in the end he could be anyone of us."
3444,"Amazing, Joaquin Phoenix would have to be one of the finest actors of this generation. One of his finest roles, the movie itself was substantial in script, cinematography and support. This movie I will be thinking about a lot and one of the rare ones I will be seeing again."
3445,This right here is cinematic gold. The cinematography is amazing. The soundtrack is spectacular. Joaquin Phoenix is crazy good; his performance keeps the movie together. The supporting cast is also great. This is how movies should be made. Character driven stories are so much better than 300$ million CG effects. Thanks WB for finally listening to the fans.
3446,"I can't trust the critics anymore. They showed everybody how bias, and not professional they are. The movie is a great masterpiece. The movie ended and I hoped I could see it again right after just so I can continue with the beautiful feeling Joaquin Phoenix gave us with his acting. You will feel bad for Joker and then you will be scared of him. This is what a true movie feels like. I loved every single frame of this great creation!"
3447,"Simply amazing and Joaquin Phoenix is perfect in this rôle. Go to see it, you will not regret it. Best movie of 2019 so far !"
3448,"As a cinema lover and a joker fan this film is the epitome if what I hoped I'd get out of this film
Truly brilliant"
3449,What an incredible performance by a Joaquin Phoenix and film directing was phenomenal.
3450,This movie is amazing. Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerising. A wonderful portrayal of a descent into madness.
3451,Joaquin Pheonix is a genius. Eerily mesmerising and beautiful in the strangest way absolutely deserving of an Oscar for this performance
3452,"That eerie laugh of his was spine chilling, the train scene was acting at its peak
#joaquinphoenix thank you for giving us the perfect introduction as Joker.
👏🏻"
3453,"Heath Ledger raised the bar with his Joker performance, but I knew that if anyone could nail this role it would be Joaquin Phoenix.
I saw Joker and I absolutely loved it! This movie does not have all the action packed scenes we are use to seeing, it focuses more on character and the genesis of the Joker.
Don't walk into the theater expecting and comparing him to Heath Ledger's performance, expect to see Joaquin Phoenix giving an Oscar worthy performance with his masterful take on it.
In yo face Marvel! As much as I enjoy the Marvel universe, in my personal opinion none of those actors can pull off a performance like Joaquin in Joker.
This movie proves that you don't need all the syfy and special effects to make a movie great, it has solid acting by a brilliant actor.
Doesn't look like he would do another one but it would be awesome if he did.
I love Phoenix and Deniro's chemistry together.
Such a great film, one that definitely deserves to receive several nominations and accolades."
3454,I saw an Oscar performance in a Oscar winning like movie
3455,It offers psychological study rather than a superhero story.Great Acting 🔥from Joaquin Phoenix
3456,This film was incredible. Joaquin was super in this film. This role was perfect for him. Oscar worthy FTW!
3457,"Joaquin Phoenix was mesmerising I couldn't take my eyes off of him he definitely deserves the Oscar for this character. It was extremely hard to watch in parts as the treatment of his character was so sad, but the film was fantastic."
3458,"Pure cinema in it's best way. This movie is based on highclass acting, no visible use of tasteless cgi effects, a well writen story line and plot. One word for this movie: sublime."
3459,"I had great expectations for the movie, but they were exceeded. This movie is a true masterpiece. From the A+ acting of Phoenix to the cinematography and the music, this movie got it all right. I don't think I've ever seen a movie this tragic and this intimidating. It's full of surprises yet you feel as you could predict Arthur Flecks next steps. It makes you want to cry and give him a hug but at the same time he's the kind of person you would try to avoid. Contrary to many reviews I do not think it glamorizes mental illnesses, on the contrary, it addresses them in a different, more realistic way. Anyone who suffered from mental health issues knows how hard it feels to act ""normal"" and how people judge you for your behavior. Neither do I think does the movie glorify violence, people who think so have clearly never seen any action movies. Joaquin Phoenix is playing the role of his life in this movie and finally gets the recognition he deserves. Overall a genius movie but not made for the faint-hearted."
3460,"This ain't an action movie or a super hero movie either. Do not expect Heath Ledger to act in this. Rest In Peace to the best Joker in the entire world. Joaquin Phoenix portrays as Arthur Fleck, suffering from a mental disorder and truly ridicule by the terror of Gotham City society. Seeing what he goes through in his life can really bring a man down to madness. Yes, the key word is madness! It's a prequel to the Dark Knight. In this movie we slowly seeing Arthur become Joker. Don't want to spoil it, because this is a character development movie. I will give Joaquin Phoenix credit as he becomes iconic clown prince of crime. Joker is the best movie of the year!"
3461,"Regardless of what some of those ""artsy"" film critics might say. This film is an absolute gem. Joaquin Phoenix in my personal opinion SURPASSED the late great Heath Ledger as the clown prince of crime. Believe me, I was pro Ledger for years upon years & even went into this film believing that Phoenix wouldn't even come close to matching Ledger's performance but man, I was wrong on so many counts. Todd Phillips did a PHENOMENAL job with the direction of the film. Phillips was definitely not the guy you would have expected to make a such a dark, aggressive & disturbing film but he sure outdid himself. If both Phoenix & Phillips don't receive an Academy award for this film, everyone should riot in clown masks at the Oscars."
3462,"The review title says it all. Joker is the movie of the year. Joaquin Phoenix was beyond incredible. Go see it, go see it again, maybe even a third time or more if you care to (which trust me you will want to.)"
3463,10 is an understatement for this movie. Phoenix is unbelievable. The storyline and sets are fantastic. I will see it again. Much much better than any of the Batman movies.
3464,"This is the best cómic movie adaptation of all time! Is a piece of art, from the beginning to the end! I was going to this movie with a big expectation and at the same time worry because maybe I will be satisfied or disappointed, but was a lot better than I was expected!! It's a different way to show a history even we know what is about!! The writer and the actor make a master piece!!"
3465,"Absolutely phenomenal. One of the most artistic and beautiful movies I have ever seen. It was incredibly disturbing but it all had a purpose, nothing was gratuitous for the sake of it. I have never audibly gasped so loudly in a movie than I did here, so many absolutely sick and shocking scenes that leave such an impact. Joaquin deserves awards."
3466,Joaquin Phoenix portrayed the growth and development of Joker in an incredibly believable progression. I loved every minute of this movie. I hooe we get to see Joaquin in this role again. Truly outstanding performance.
3467,Not much can be said . Just Master piece.great performance and music. Great story line . And above all great laugh:))
3468,"It is the perfect combination between Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" and ""King of Comedy"", however ""Joker"" is a unique and original character study masterpiece! Todd Phillips did a marvelous job with the character, origin story, and film!
About Joaquin's interpretation i can't say it is the best or my favourite of all time, because that would mean to compare it to other interpretations, and that would be a huge insult for Joaquin Phoenix! What he did in this film is absolutely uncomparable!! No award can express the real value of this interpretation!"
3469,Amazing film with a great character development that will leave you in shock and awe. This film will challenge you on every emotional level.
3470,"Rarely do you come across movies which hits the perfect chords on all aspects. This is that movie.
Acting is absolutely phenomenal, direction top notch. But the icing on this wonderful and tasteful cake would have to be the background score."
3471,"The culmination of the world's atrocities and ignorance of what we've done to the modern man. A gut wrenching, beautifully artistic, and poignant work. The cinematography, the acting, the score, every detail of this film is put together with such care and purpose that it will creep itself into your mind until it's there forever. Cinema needed this."
3472,Wow. This movie was truly disturbing and marvelous at the same time. Mr. Phoenix you are truly the best joker ever. Best performance ever given in a movie. I was just in awe when the movie ended.
3473,"There's a reason why there are so many 10 star reviews. Joker is a perfect film. Beautifully shot, tragic, funny at times and dark. Joaquin Phoenix delivers per usual and is mesmerizing to watch. Congrats to Todd Phillips and the rest of the crew for this masterpiece🤡🙏🏻"
3474,"What I love about this version of the joker is he doesn't fall into the chemicals and fight Batman. He is simply a man who is disregarded and abused by society. His mother emotionally abused him to the point where he believed he has a mental illness. He is also mocked by the upperclass society and keeps everyone feeling like they will be the next one to die. I don't care if this movie gets mixed or bad reviews. The film tracks a man's decent into madness in spectacular fashion, with a fully committed Joaquin Phoenix leading the charge."
3475,"It was heavy, spent most of the time with my hand over my mouth, and thinking about what I think about this movie. Seen so many disturbing stuff in films, people getting eaten alive in the worst ways by zombies, cannibalism, skinning, etc. yet this movie made someone getting shot and someone getting stabbed the maybe most disturbing thing I've ever witnessed. I have deduced because it was so real. The insanity expressed was so real, it left me so uncomfortable. Felt like DC let out their pent up rage towards Marvel... kinda kidding. But basically this movie deserves the revolutionary hype it's getting, and this is coming from someone who was skeptical of all the praise."
3476,"I never write reviews, this may actually be the first time I have written one. I thought that the movie was brilliant. The acting was perfect and the psychological aspect of the film was beyond any expectations I had."
3477,I have always self identified with the joker and this movie only confirms things for me.
3478,"Sadly a lot of snowflakes wont understand this movie, its a masterpiece <3 <3"
3479,"Joaquin Phoenix Is phenomenal in this film, but the movie cannot use his performance to create a memorable film, lack of a good script and directing is so clear! Having Pheonix in this film is like driving a Ferrari in your back yard, a total waste of art ! Phillips was not a good choice to write and direct this film! (Coming from Hang Over and Due Date!!)"
3480,"Honestly, I do not write reviews as I think it is a waste of time... but this movie - is ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES - I have ever seen, I have seen LOTS of movies in my life. This movie takes the 1st place as you get to see how a depressed and sad man let down by society goes ""crazy"" because of not been taking seriously in his entire life. Also, the part in the movie were Arthur (Joaquin) laugh without his will is a masterpiece of act by Joaquin, you will get emotionally touched by the scene. Hands down, ""One of the best movies in history""."
3481,"Deniro being the central character of both of the above movies makes his role in Joker a brilliant choice! I don't write movie reviews, so I apologize for the brevity of this one. Basically, in a time where movies struggle to be a 6 out of 10, Joker nails it with a 10!! Never a boring moment."
3482,"I thought this was an incredible movie, and I'm shocked that mainstream reviews have been so negative. I personally think it's because of the social commentary that's so pervasive throughout it. I read one review from NBC I think that said this movie had no point or substance, which of course anyone who's watched it would know is total b.s. They aren't stupid; they know that this was a critique of the elite (among other things). You had sympathy for him, while still being incredibly uncomfortable watching it.
This movie was very intense and disturbing. There was nothing entertaining about it. It kept me up most of the night. Everything about it was well-done, and it's unfortunate it isn't getting the response it should from film critics, but again, I think we all know why that is.
Also, I thought the emphasis on mental illness was very profound. I liked the part where he wrote down something like ""Why is it that when you have a mental illness people expect you to behave as if you don't?"""
3483,"This movie is a message for us don't push any human to his max. Who created joker is us. We push him to his max , what he get in his life only bad treatment after we give him tools ,then he being creative criminal"
3484,Here's The Joker we've been waiting for and it is best portrayal of the character and the acting of Joaquin Phoenix is mindblowing it gives goosebumps just by his facial expressions.
3485,"I've made this account today just to rate this film a straight 10/10.
Unbelievable say no more."
3486,"This movie is and will be an Icon for a long long time. It awaken my emotions in a way that you don't even feel the surroundings..
absolute a masterpiece love it. It should get all the oscarsPS the actor brett ( Batmans Dad ) is the same actor who played the congressman in dark knight rises :(
Should have picked someone else"
3487,If you think you are gonna see a superhero themed movie you are wrong. What the movie is about is that it tells how someone can go crazy true the hard society. I think Phoenix is a real good actor who fits perfectly for this role. This is one of my favorite movies ever.
3488,Please watch this film to make up your own mind and don't read the critics reviews
3489,"This movie is VERY strong and shake your world with an elementary power. It IS violent but this is a story, a movie and gives you a perspective deeply on something what you could never really seen before.
First movie in this year!! which is something unusual, cathartic, deep, thanks for Joaquin Phoenix! I really felt that guy and I will never forget this acting!
THIS IS A MASTERPIECE."
3490,"Despite rotten tomatoes and metacritic ratings.
This movie show why warner bros still above desney."
3491,"I dont understand why do people have this urge to compare the 2 jokers. Todd phillips shows us the slow descent of a loner into madness, whereas Nolan's Joker show the level of menace Joker could go to. Both are fantastic, but when the fools start to compare, they are not comparing apples to apples. Ofcourse Joaquin's role as Joker wont be as crazy, menacing & fear inducing as Heath Ledger's coz he is still coming to terms with being Joker. Anyways, with almost 95% of the screentime for one character alone, this movie was fantastic & lived up to my expectation of Joker. Some people would also be cheesed about the fact that there is a hugeee departure from the comic book, but i respect Todd's vision."
3492,"At least top 5 one of the best movies ever made.
You are going to be really really satisfied"
3493,"Yesterday I think I watched history,best movie EVER for a comic book villain.The performances were all amazing especially the oscar worthy Joaquin (I put a bet with my girl that he will win the oscar)!! AAAAAMAZING!!!"
3494,"Gritty, dirty, sad, poetic and quite brilliant the build up of a maniac its mesmerizing to an extent, can you believe Joker has a movie on its own, that should be the punchline to one of his jokes. Sorry it didn't turn into a full blown, I hate the president movie like everything else that's coming out this days. Watch it there's no action just disturbing images of pure rage and incredible acting compose by the amazing score of music. Joker is Phoenix but the music its also Joker my god it's so great how well that blends from beginning to the very end. Gotham looks incredibly looks real and it felt real, this movie can stand on its own and DC can go suck it please let this be the route to more of this artistic masterpieces."
3495,The movie is so good that you might not be willing to leave the theatre even after the movie is finished. Its even darker than the dark Knight. Pls go and watch it because you owe it to yourself
3496,"I saw it yesterday evening with my younger brother. That was the best quality screen possible in my city, which of course costs a lot compared to regular screens.
BUT, I already bought a ticket for tonight's show too in the same screen!
That was just an amazing movie! I barely gave any 10 stars for movies, but this one is a solid 10!"
3497,"Firstly, ignore some of the media critics strange negative agenda/reviews. This movie is superb! Phoenix is one of the best character actors there is! He definitely is the most immersive actor out there. Beautiful cinematography. Dark and foboding. In a city where an elitist minority are looking down on the poor suffering majority; pushing them to the edge with Joker ultimately as their king! It's not your twee little crowd pleaser movie. Thank goodness. More like this please! If there aren't Oscars handed out on this one you just known they're definitely not worth having in the first place!"
3498,"Best acting I have seen in awhile. If he doesn't get an Oscar, I'm not sure why they even exist."
3499,Joaquin's masterpiece! I hate how people are purposely giving it a 1-star rating to bring it down. Joaquin was incredible. Nailed the laugh!
3500,"Can two different actors earn an Oscar for playing the same character? I mean has that happened before? If not, then it's about to. Phoenix isn't in this movie.. you're watching the Joker. It has the same vibe as Taxi Driver. A slow burn look into the mind of a mentally demented ""good"" guy."
3501,Best Movie. Best content. Should definitely win the Oscars
3502,"I will say this: WOW. This film is a perfect case study about the breakup of the personality of a lonely man with psychological problems. This is not a movie about super heroes and if someone goes to see it with such attitude then they will be disappointed. The action revolves very slowly, slower than in a Hitchcock film. But oh boy ... I watched Phoenix's creation with a flush on my face. For me, the biggest plus (ATTENTION SPOILER) is that the film is set in our reality of the eatly 80s (SPOILER END) and that the characters are ordinary people, who struggle with the hardships of everyday life and loneliness despite the fact that they exist side by side of one another. You can literally identify with them, because they are struggling with the same adversities as each of us every single day. The actors were perfectly cast and matched to the roles and were able to portray the respective characters at a top drawer level, but I think that especially Hoaquin did a great job and matched the creation of Heath Ledger's Joker (I deliberately do not write that he played it better, because both Jokers, Hoaquin's and Heath's are two entirely different characters - it's impossible compare them). Speaking of Ledger, I appreciate and respect the two subtle nods to his Joker in this film. Chapo bas for these references to the director. ""Joker"" in my opinion is the best origin story, both of the Archduke of Crime and Batman (mini spoiler, sorry). I would highly recommend this film to anyone."
3503,"The best part of this movie is Juaquin Pheonix's performance. He was born to play this role and he absolutely delivers by giving one of the most disturbing and unsettling performances of all time. This movie also has brilliant cinematography, and it looked absolutely gorgeous in IMAX. Todd Phillips managed to give us a new Taxi Driver for our time. It's disturbing, violent, offensive, and shocking, but it forces you to open your eyes and consume every second of it just like Taxi Driver made us do in 1976."
3504,"Just got home from Swansea vue cinema, it was full glad I booked the tickets online.
This film is outstanding the performance from Joaquin alone is mental his physical appearance is scary, his sheer laughter made me feel bad for him, you can tell he put a lot into this role.
I had goosebumps and felt terror at the same time at the part with his boss telling him to get the sign back his face and the score my goodness what a film.
I understand this film isn't for everyone but my goodness get on it, the visuals, the score and acting is beautifully haunting. I think dc have done right on this one. Get on it."
3505,"Joaquin Phoenix's performance as Arthur Fleck was nothing short of a MASTERPIECE. The entire film is sublime, a true piece of cinema art, the likes of which have not been seen for a long time!"
3506,"No words to describe the performance of Joaquin Phoenix.
Amazing music and images.
MASTERPIECE."
3507,MasterpieceAmazing in everything.Joaquin Phoenix = OscarEnd......
3508,Ledger's Joker was a pure maniac and fun to watch. But this is intimate. Too intimate that I almost cried for Joker10/10
3509,"First time reviewing on here, but felt like it needed some appreciation. Phoenix with a sublime performance. It was gritty and compelling. Some parts towards the beginning seemed quite offish, but it made the end even better when the twist came out. Honestly 10/10"
3510,"Let me start by saying that when I left the cinema, I felt that I liked the movie a lot, and at the same time I felt disgusted by it. Maybe it's the portrayal of a broken man that has been put over the edge and gets really violent and crazy that left me feel that way.This movie offers a LOT of things to think about about our society, about our life in general and the way we treat the weak among us. I think this movie TRULY depicts how a psychopath is formed and the consequences this brings.The Joker is not ""likeable"" character but in many cases I think the public can explain his actions as being reasonable and logic.The movie is very, very, very deep and it's not just for entertainment purposes. I advise the public watching it have the mindset that they will be watching something truly different and not think of it as the latest Hollywood flick, because it is not.The movie is so deep I believe you have to watch it 2-3 times to grasp it.The acting is not great - it's UNBELIEVABLE! Joaquin MUST win Oscar with this. Movies like this are very rare and far in between. I hope more people can understand it because this is a complicated movie and I fear the broad audience won't grasp it's meaning."
3511,This movie was the best movie so far! And I must say that Joaquin really deserves an Oscar for his performance! It's that simple
3512,"Go watch it if you enjoy slow, dark, psychological thrillers!Phoenix journey from Arthur to Joker will stay with you for years!"

3514,The best ever it personafiese the joker's in every aspect
3515,"Legen... wait for it dary
Phoenix definitely deserved the Oscar"
3516,Michaelangelo painted the sistine chapel Todd Phillips made The Joker.
3517,"Words need not describe the Masterpiece Todd Philips and the tour-de-force named Joaquin Phoenix created for the Audience...From the visuals the score to most importantly Phoenix's unabashed Acting, this film is a strong pointing finger at the society's negligence towards mental illness and the Ill effects it ultimately creates both at the community and the person... beautifully portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix, the audience doesn't need an explanation to understand the theme, but solely through this one man's acting...as the protagonist loses his sanity one frame at a time, so does the film, finally culminating in a climax tying into the mythology so established by the Comics it based on...and thus is where the critics got it all wrong... wrongfully labelled PRO GUN VIOLENCE propaganda piece without any substance, they have tore this film with negative reviews, even preaching the audience to stay away from it altogether...my humble advice as a fellow movie goer.. please ignore those ""personal"" opinion of these so called ""reviewers""..go see for yourself...
PS- Rest assured after watching, you won't feel the need to take a gun and start a massacre as these critics labelled it to be... you will feel disturbed..but that is what ultimately the film wanted"
3518,I will be watching it again this movie dissever am Oscar
3519,"As a filmmaker is it ok to be inspired by other films? Absolutely, It happens all the time.What if as a director your homage to particular movies is very obvious? As long as he makes it his own stylistically, it's all forgiven.""Good artist borrow, Great artist steal"" quote comes to mind.
Whenever you have whole scenes basically copied from previous movies, thats when more mature audience might feel bit cheated because they associate them with movies from the past. However if you find way of original delivery of these ideas you might struck an emotional gold with the audiences as it happened in this case.The first thing you notice as Todd Phillips's 'JOKER' begins is its 1.85 : 1 aspect ratio, different then the CinemaScope
2.35 : 1 standard widescreen ratio which often is being used on big franchise superhero films, that gives the movie more cinematic feel. This choice alone signalises to the audience that they are watching a superhero movie unlike any other which came before it. One that is stylistically tilted towards Arthouse cinema narrating style, instead of typical standard CGI big budget blockbuster.'JOKER' is a story of the origin, told as a character study with everything in it screams quality.
In essence it is a film of two half's.
First half of the film is based on character development which is drama based, where we are getting to know our protagonist/anti-hero. The second half of the film turns to a thriller when Arthur Fleck titled JOKER, decides to take his revenge on the people who mistreated him in the past. Its very easy to see parallels between JOKER and other movies like 'Taxi driver' (1976) and 'The King of Comedy' (1982) directed by Martin Scorsese.
Deliberate choice of casting Robert DeNiro as Murray Franklin a chat show host Artur looks up to is for mature audience clear bow towards both Scorsese movies I mentioned. Todd Phillips is very transparent with that, perhaps too transparent. Once again, its ok to pay homage to films from the past, however when you are trying to copy the whole scenes, you need to make sure that your interpretation will be original enough which 'JOKER' does very well indeed.
'JOKER' is very well directed, there is a clarity of what Todd Phillips is trying to communicate to the audience and he is doing it in a very subtle way.
There is a one scene in 'JOKER' which brilliantly showcases the disconnect of Artur from the normal society when he goes to the comedy club to tries to see what jokes get biggest laughs. However being socially inept the timing when he laughs is totally different than other members of the audience. They laugh on punchlines but he seems to be laughing in random moments, showing clear disconnect from collective subconscious part of the society, making him stand out. Simple choice that communicates to the viewer of the movie so much about the loneliness, separation and longing for human connection which Artur feels.Beautifully lensed by Lawrence Sher with a great slow motion sequences, which gives 'JOKER' grand feature film vibe, but also handheld shots, which with movement of the actor create artistic ballet like sequences when Artur is walking or dancing, putting the audience in a dream like state.However this film would not be what it is without brilliant character study of Joaquin Phoenix!
His performance is definitely up there with Heath Ledger Oscar winning creation of Joker character in Christopher Nolan's 'THE DARK KNIGHT'.
Performance of Joaquin Phoenix as Artur the clown/standup comic who becomes Joker will surely get him nomination for an Oscar.
Phoenix's performance seems to be little bit more subtle and internal. For this role Joaquin lost over 20KG to inhabit the character physically and developed characteristic laugh that comes out of pain in characters emotional core. The interesting part is that after we witness Artur's misfortunes we start to identify with his struggle because we understand that his mental illness comes from disturbing childhood and years of abuse. His ability to twist his thin body in weird positions reminded me Christian Bale performance in 'The Machinist'(2004) another movie about paranoid delusions.
Joaquins performance of Joker reminds us how weirdly talented he is with acting choices that are very original and emotionally engaging.On top of everything Todd Phillips in 'JOKER' seems to showcase clash of two worlds.
The world of super rich and those who are poor, who often deal with mental and emotional problems. Even Gotham City is stylized to look like modern day San Francisco to give that incentive.
This film does not promote violence but in a way justifies it. Artur from a victim becomes a hero to many, because he decides to stand up for himself and use image of the Joker as a catalyst for this change and in that way he becomes symbol of revolutionary change for those who are less privileged.
But most importantly 'JOKER' as a movie is a mental illness study intertwine in social and economical satire that brings questions about the discrepancy between super rich and poor people in American society today.I will most definitely see 'JOKER' again to have further assessment, but after the first viewing I am pretty sure next March we will see some Oscars coming its way.
Highly recommended!
********** out of 10 stars."
3520,"This movie is going to be one of the greatest masterpieces of this century! And years from now actors and filmmakers will look back at it as a form of inspiration. Joaquin's performance was so raw and powerful it was almost impossible to know if he was an actor or really the character!
Beautiful cinematography, one of the best directions I have seen, and ofcourse a great background score!!
Definitely, multiple Oscar worthy starting with Joaquin Phoenix"
3521,"I've seen every cinematic portrayal of the Joker so far and never thought I'd find myself saying anyone played the character better than Ledger, but Joaquin Phoenix's version of the clown villian has matched and in my opinion exceeded that of The Dark Knight's. Phoenix keeps you mesmerised from start to finish, and you become totally enveloped in his story and character development.
Although Joker links in the Batman/Wayne storyline, do NOT go to the cinema expecting a comic book movie - this is a character driven drama and not one for the kids, with some pretty brutal scenes. Joaquin Phoenix is a tour de force in this movie, if he doesn't receive an Oscar for Joker it will be a travesty. Kudos also goes to director Todd Phillips for his first dramatic movie, Joker is a fantastic debut. Go see it!!"
3522,"This movie was fantastic in my opinion. Plenty of critics hated on the way this movie was blandly reimagined from films like Taxi Driver and the King of Comedy, two films I thoroughly enjoyed. I thought the film had its own piece of uniqueness especially with Phoenix's amazing performance. From the first minute I was captivated and I loved what Joaquin and Todd were able to do with this character. The soundtrack and score for this movie was also very impressive. Hildur Guðnadóttir did a fantastic job and the score never felt over the top to me. Did I like Taxi Driver better, yes, but from a technical and film perspective. I do think, however, that this film manages to capture something that Taxi Driver doesn't and that is the unique saneness and personality of the character we know of as the JOKER."
3523,"Movie of the decade.
Performance of the century.
Crazy score and cinematography.
Joaquin Phoenix is the best and darkest joker ever with huge respect to Heath Ledger's phenomenal and outstanding performance.
Depressing.
Haunting.
Terrifying.
A wake up call.
Will leave you speechless."
3524,"A movie must first of all be interesting: it must have, if not a coherent point of view, at least a worked-out, thought-provoking set of themes, some kind of imaginative contact with the world as we know it. ""Joker,"" an empty, foggy exercise in second-hand style and second-rate philosophizing, has none of that. Besotted with the notion of its own audacity - as if willful unpleasantness were a form of artistic courage - the film turns out to be afraid of its own shadow, or at least of the faintest shadow of any actual relevance."
3525,"On fire 🔥
It was amazing I really like it
Everyone should watch it"
3526,The films score is highly underrated. Truly remarkable. It brings emotion and intensity and somehow an uncomfortable sense of emotion while watching the psycho joker slowly come alive. Joaquin 10/10 acting.
3527,Joaquin is a phenomenal actor. I am absolutely speechless. Best movie I have ever seen 10/10
3528,"This move is a masterpiece. If DCEU started with this movie, they would be controlling the media now. All the controversy surrounding this film is baseless and just dumb.
It's a must watch 10/10"
3529,"One of the best movies in these few years, oll must watch this movie, but not kids!"
3530,"I went in wondering how it would compare to the Dark Knight. My thoughts are the dark knight is an amazing batman movie for teenagers. Joker is a jaw dropping, gripping, dark film for adults. I wouldn't suggest taking your kids to this one but that's what makes it so good. It's mature content delivers a punch so strong that you will find yourself pulled into a comic book movie. (I can't believe it's based off of a comic book to be honest it felt so different from every other comic book movie) I strongly suggest it."
3531,"10/out of MF 10. Forget the media fear mongering. This was a relatable film because I am a female with some mental health issues and it covered that aspect with respect and the troubles that go along with being cut off of medication & services. Joaquin's performance is indeed Oscar worthy (not that it even matters to him) and it is on par with Ledger's. It also comes together nicely with a twist I didn't expect in the Batman universe. Anyone who has an issue with this cinematic masterpiece should stick to PG fluffy bunny Marvel films because this Alan Moore material is for us big kids. Go see this film.
Also on a side note I attended the movie with 3 other female friends who all LOVED it so this media outrage about it being only for a certain demographic is completely ridiculous. So yes some of us women are big fans of these films and I hope we continue to get quality cinema such as this."
3532,"Loved the plot, loved how real it feels, loved the acting, the soundtrack, everything is just great.
A whole new level of cinema. Also, Joaquin Phoenix for the love of god, give this man an oscar.
Do yourself a favor and watch this incredible movie."
3533,"This is one of the best films I have seen in a long time. It added something other iterations of the Joker haven't; a sense of humanity. Phoenix was the perfect choice for the character. Rivalling the late Heath Ledger, both actors brought something different to the role and if Ledger was still alive, I am sure he would've been proud of his close friend.Through the many twists and shocking scenes, the movie came out on top and delivered many memorable quotes, many memorable characters and many memorable moments.This is the film that will be talked about for years to come. 11/10"
3534,The best movie I have ever seen this 3 years!It's definitely a must seen!
3535,"A slow-paced, tightly woven psychological thriller, JOKER is truly one for the books. Joaquin Phoenix brings a performance that sends shivers down your spine. This film is beautifully shot and incredibly well written, with a consistent and uncomfortable tone. I have never been more hypnotized by a scene in a film like I was during almost every shot in the last hour of JOKER. Arthur Fleck became whole the moment he truly donned the Joker persona. Phoenix's character development throughout the piece is unheard of."
3536,This film is an intense look at a troubled soul and it's amazing! All the critics saying it glorifies violence have really just missed the point of the movie. Todd Phillips has created a masterpiece and Phoenix is phenomenal.
3537,"Best movie of the year. This is not debatable. If you don't like this film, you have bad taste. If you aren't blown away, you really need to rethink your life."
3538,"Nice movie, such a great performance from Joaquin deserve the Oscar with no doubt, Great cinematography, great music, the movie take comics cinema to another level."
3539,"Let me start by saying that It's not a your typical superhero movie. Again, if you're looking for a fully packed explosive power clash between hero/villain, don't even bother.With that said, many of the 10/10 must have come from people who either are Joker fan or could truly appreciate the becoming of one of the most iconic villain of all time. Considering the niche theme of the movie though, they made many valid points because the connecting dots in the last 30 minutes are just beautiful.Joker is a dark, psychotic, and depressing movie for 80 % of screen time and it could be irritating to watch. However, it also managed to convey the complex lives of the oppressed and inequality faced in the society, which makes the character more relatableLet me save you some time by saying, Joker taken at face value, is nothing but depressing to watch. Not until he rediscovered his priorities and embrace his darker side near the end of the movie it became intriguing albeit still very dark to watch."
3540,Todd phillips better get a new cupboard for his new trophies. An absolute masterpiece.
3541,"Joker is undoubtedly the best movie of this year and one of the best in recent times.
When Joaquin phoenix was cast as joker I was a sceptical but after watching this film I can confidently say, he has full justice to this iconic character. His Maniac laugh, his mood swings, his dancing, makeup everything is perfect.
Now, joker is not a superhero movie it's more like a psychological thriller. It's dark and haunting and at times very disturbing. The background music is great and even though the story is slow paced, it has some surprises.
If you are a joker fan like me you will love it, if you love great cinema, you will love it.
Just keep one thing in mind, this is fiction, not a reality.
I have seen some of the criticizing the film based on some absurd reasons. They couldn't find anything wrong in the film but they thought it inspires gun violence and glorifies crime. Let's me tell you, It doesn't."
3542,"Excellent story and take on the character, and a stellar performance by Joaquin Phoenix."
3543,Never imgained a director who has directed hangover series can create this genre. Nor I have ever seen and given standing ovation in cinema before. You can even critize one scene in this movie.Too Good
3544,Just saw the Movie an Hour ago and it's was pure classic DC master piece hats off Performance by Joaquin undoubtedly a great piece of work & love story development of the Joker character and back story surely this deserve an Oscar
3545,"Joker who tries to spread happiness and joy to everyone, faced the harsh cruelties of life and lack of empathy from everyone. This movie basically shows the 1980s' America, when CCTV Cameras were not there and the grotesque and hideous act took place every now and then. He, who has mental disorder and uncontrollable-hysterical laughter, when pushed on the brink, comes out to be a sociopath and sadist. This movie basically show the harsh reality of today's world, where everyone is looking for their own benefit. No one is ready to see others' condition or show empathy. The plot of the movie is intriguing, strong and practical. Camera angles are totally perfect -like they even show the hand and legs movements of The Joker, whenever he feel excruciating, the ending of the movie is wonderfully captured- I mean the ending of the movie will make an impact on you even after the movie. Eventually, every single second of this movie is totally worth watching. Don't want to spoil anything because this is the irresistible content."
3546,"Just watch it, you will see why the headline is 110% true."
3547,Too much silence moments like all Joaquin Phoenix movies this actor takes to to duff lands where no one speaks like and old chaplen movie but this one you lose interest after 30 min cause the main character dont talk and i still think that Heath Ledger was the best for the joker so far and i cant deny that i like phoenix but he is a silent actor he cant act and talk at the same time which is weird
3548,"I know you'll hate on me for saying this, but this Joker is better than Heath Ledger's Joker. This doesn't mean that Heath Ledgers Joker was bad. Unless there is a better performance this year Joaquin Phoenix should get the Oscar for this.But what went wrong here is that there was no protagonist vs. antagonist. Yes the ""world"" was shown to be the antagonist, and for a certain while it worked. But this movie needed a Batman. And I mean THIS movie, not any other Joker movie, but THIS movie specifically needed a Batman. Because then the ending does not seem satisfying enough. But still it was a good movie. It was pretty brave to show Thomas Wayne and Pennyworth as jerks. And what was up with their age? Why were Thomas Wayne and Pennyworth and Martha Wayne so old?So in the end I'l say, this 2 hr movie had at least 1/2 hr worth if needles scenes and exposition. The build up was good. I'm kinda conflicted. 1 and 1/2 hrs should've been given to the Jokers creation back story and 1 hr should've been Batman. Or maybe not. I also feel that adding Batman to this movie would've caused it to flop cause we still haven't gotten over the horrible Snyder version of Batman. So I'll give this movie both 10/10 and 1/10."
3549,"I went to a mostly empty premiere with about a dozen others. There were two fan boys with me who have comic book rooms in their houses. We were unenthusiastic. The film was boring, depressing, sad. There were two funny moments that were unintentional. I see that in Italy at the premiere it got an 8 minute standing ovation, that should be a warning. When artsy people like something, it is going to be a crappy art project. That is what this is. Depressing. Sad. I don't know how else to put it. When it was over, people were saying WTH? I see a lot of 10 reviews on here -- nubes. Anyone who is a comic book fan would see this as a bust, they should have spent the movie on a Batman reboot. Can't recommend. Won't ever see again. Can't imagine anyone buying the DVD."
3550,So much I could say. This is sad because I'm a fan of the Batman franchise and I'm a fan of Joaquin Phoenix. He was great in gladiator and he was incredible in walk the line.I'll agree to disagree with the director on this one. The Arc of the story is not a narrative which is one that is well told shot or portrayed. And I I'm a film student from one of the best colleges in the country. I'm sorry to give it such a low score cuz I had such high expectations from it. But I have to maintain my honor my integrity and the truth. I could go on and on scene-by-scene frame-by-frame shot by shot. It's sad depressing that's not why it's received the score but that is part of the tone of the movie. Doesn't properly explain the character of joker and I think his inability to control his laughter as psychotic is a huge discredits towards the legacy of the comics of Batman.
3551,"Based on the way people were talking about this movie I thought it was gonna have some amazing in-depth insights to offer about nihilism and modern life on top of the 'relating to the bad guy' narrative.Honestly this movie is shallow - it's a well shot, reasonably well acted mini character study and that's about it.. there's no deeper messages or meaning and honestly you could derive 80% of what this movie is from just watching the trailer.. so save yourself a couple of hours and watch the trailer."
3552,"You know how people get mad at disney films for taking classic beloved films and selling them as new movies? Well I'd argue that that's exactly what Joker is doing. The film is basically a remake of ""The King of Comedy"" that brings nothing new to the table. I'd actually that Joker is almost worse than these Disney remakes because at least people Disney remakes don't try to trick their audiences into believing they're doing anything new. This film, on the other hand, does nothing new but still tries to dupe its audience into thinking its a groundbreaking work of art. Sure, this style of filmmaking is new for the genre, but this doesn't mean it's not a completely unoriginal film with nothing to say. It's the plot of King of Comedy and the themes of Taxi Driver. That's it. It thinks it's a lot smarter than it is. It takes so much from other films without recognizing what made these films great.Phoenix gives a great performance though"
3553,"I know everyone wants to give a good actor kudos. I get that. The movie was drab. I got sick of watching it. Yes, it shows how a disturbed person can regress, but it moves slowly and loses its grip. For those in the psychological thriller genre it may have value."
3554,Smoking and laughing are the two main things failed the film.
3555,"Joaquin's performance was brilliant and captivating as I expected. After reading a ton of reviews I noticed everyone seems to be missing what the character of Joker was in the comics? The joker was Batman's greatest nemesis. The Joker in this movie in no way appeared to be methodical, manipulative or a big threat to someone like Batman..He was just a dopey, clumsy, disturbed mental patient. I couldn't get past that. I could'n't see how this portrayal could ever play into a Batman movie with Bat Mobiles and Bat Jets regardless of how amazing his character development was? To me a comic book character movie should play into future films. It would take a reinvention of Batman or for this dopey portrayal of the Joker to somehow become batman's greatest foe to make another movie. I don't see it."
3556,"No wonder this grossed more than a BILLION DOLLARS in the BOX OFFICE world wide, Kudos to Joaquin for putting on a spectacular performance, you can clearly see the downward spiral in his life from the first scene up to the last scene...marvelous film. a must see..."
3557,"Wouldn't flinch giving it 15/10, for the acting and the story. Its slow, but bear with it, will give you fruits!"
3558,The first hour and half of this movie was so boring that I almost left. The action started at the end when finally the Joker is presented in a show.I am so disappointed
3559,I am disappointed and bored! Is not what I expected! Even I prefer DC more than Marvel they should could done it better!
3560,"The disappointment of the year. The story is empty, without a clear purpose. In depth characterization doesn't make a movie by itself. It's boring as hell."
3561,"Brilliant performance. Very believable. But this was a complete re write of the Jokers history. I don't think this kind of editing should be allowed. Would have been far better inventing a new character. This film is about mental illness. The super villain thing seems to be just tagged on. In my opinion, completely unnecessary. I would also say that it's using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. The repetition of Joker's degenerating condition is shown far too frequently. How many times do you need to hear his uncontrollable laugh? A good film but not really about the Joker. Go back to Heath Ledger to see how it should be done"
3562,"Sure Phoenix's acting is good, but I found the movie boring and depressing. His character is just sad, empty and pathetic and this is what gives the tone to the whole movie. At the end we're not sure what's real and what's not, but it doesn't matter to me because there's no payoff."
3563,It is good but no one can do it like Heath Ledger.
3564,"After the catastrophic failure of the DCEU that had yet to produce a quality film, Warner Bros. switched its game plan in favor of establishing single characters rather than a whole cinematic universe. The first of this new character driven model is ""Joker"", Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of how one man can go so far down the rabbit hole.The story follows Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a man who was put on this earth ""to spread joy and laughter"". The downtrodden citizens of Gotham have got it bad right now, but Arthur seems to have it the worst. He's a social outcast, has mental issues that give him uncontrollable fits of laughter, and he lives with his mother in a disgusting apartment. With the world getting crazier by the day, Arthur's attempts to keep sane get more and more futile, leading him to the point of no return.Directed by Todd Phillips, ""Joker"" supplants itself into its grungy setting of 1980s Gotham (very much modeled after New York City), complete with overflowing garbage and ""super rats"". The swooping cinematography by Lawrence Sher highlights the grimy claustrophobia and the unrelenting score by Hildur Guðnadóttir never allows for a moment of levity. You're fully immersed within the cesspool that the city has become.Besides the technicals brilliantly setting the scene, they also lend their hand to the making of some suspenseful and terrifying sequences of shocking violence. These acts are incredibly tough to watch and become even harder when you factor in Phoenix's no holds barred performance.Phillips very blatantly takes some influence (that's the polite way of saying it) from Martin Scorsese's great works of ""Taxi Driver"" and ""The King of Comedy"". The structure of the story and a few key scenes look and feel ripped right out of those classics.While Scorsese is the master to take after, the whole thing here feels like a self-indulgent exercise by Phillips to make himself out to be a real auteur and not just the guy who made ""The Hangover"" trilogy. There's an aura of artiness that is coated on to imitate the feeling of thematic depth while offering little under the surface.Despite being about the most famous comic book villain of all time, ""Joker"" doesn't follow the usual narrative track. There are some winks and nods that keep it connected to the Batman universe, but the story is solely focused on our central character and his mad descent.Phillips and co-writer stray away from the previous model that never allowed for comic book movies to address societal issues. They plunge headfirst into dissecting the issues of mental health and class warfare.The pair deserve some praise for their efforts, but these attempts at making statements are both too unoriginal and handled with too little nuance. Throughout the film, the only message that sticks out is that society and people are terrible, and are capable of bringing us down despite our best efforts.It's a grand statement, but one that's so over-simplistic and devoid of depth that it ends up meaning nothing. It's merely a statement of facts that everyone has figured out throughout their life and has seen in better movies before.Taking over the role after the character's worst rendition by Jared Leto in ""Suicide Squad"", Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant and downright terrifying as the clown prince of crime. From his maniacal laugh, contorted body movements, and rubbery facial expressions, Phoenix commands each scene and elevates some of the film's follies.It reminds one of his equally brilliant performance as Freddy Quell in ""The Master"", only this time the crazy has been dialed to the max. You can never look away from him as he fills the entire frame. And you also never want to look away as he keeps you on the edge of your seat.In the reverse role from what he played in ""The King of Comedy"", Robert De Niro does solid work as the comic insulting late-night show host. It's a role De Niro is tailor-made for as he can poke fun and unintentionally spur Gotham's societal struggles.Loud and abrasive, ""Joker"" is a film that makes a lot of noise, but doesn't say much of anything. But even with its mixed message falling flat, ""Joker"" still deserves praise for its boldness to go where others won't. Plus, it's leagues better than anything the DCEU has and ever will offer, so there is some hope that DC characters will soon get their proper time in the spotlight."
3565,Boring movie rather watched something else and saved myself a cheeky tenner 👍
3566,"I feel the odd one out here but the pacing seemed very off, the acting was great. By the time the film got to an interesting point I was already wishing for it to end. Could have cut a good portion of this film out to make it much better and much better in pacing. Far from a cinematic masterpiece which it should have been."
3567,"After seeing the credits roll on ""Joker"", it took me a bit to figure out my exact feelings towards it. On one hand, there is nothing inherently bad about the film, and it certainly is a new/fresh way to examine that character's backstory mythos. On the other hand, however, there is also a thought that nagged me which said that something was a bit ""off"" about the whole thing. The conclusion I've come to is that while ""Joker"" is a legitimate take on his origins, it just isn't the #1 (or even #2) take that I prefer.For a basic overview, this film focuses on Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), an aspiring stand-up comedian who works as an entertaining clown to support himself. Arthur clearly also has some some of mental illness, including the propensity for laughter when the emotional situation does not call for it. The combination of all these factors sees Fleck mistreated or put down by society at nearly every step of his Gotham-dwelling existence. After perpetuating a subway murder and then being embarrassed on live television by Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), the late-night talk show host he idolizes, Fleck transforms himself into the tragically comedic figure Batman fans know well.I actually have more respect than most, I think, towards the validity of this ""take"" on The Joker. It is easily the most gritty and true-to-life that has ever been attempted at this point. Basically, WB and director Todd Phillips are saying ""here is how a real-life Joker figure could spring up"", right down to explaining the makeup and predilection towards uncontrollable laughter. In and of itself, there really isn't anything ""wrong"" with this take.That being said, I still prefer Ledger's mysterious Joker of ""The Dark Knight"" or even Nicholson's mob-leader Joker of ""Batman (1989)"". Acting performances strictly aside for the moment, I just don't know about--and feel a little uncomfortable with--the Joker being a tragic figure. I prefer the comic-book approach of Nicholson falling into the vat of chemicals, or the air of mystery surrounding where exactly Ledger's Joker came from. Having this Phoenix Joker spring from a place of potential sympathy? However legitimate that take may be, I just don't like it as much.There are also a few frustrating choices that hold back the overall story of the film:
-A subplot involving Arthur's neighbor down the hall (played by Zazie Beetz) goes absolutely nowhere and ends up meaning very little.
-The shoehorning of the Wayne family into the movie. Did we really need to see the Waynes murder again?! That's becoming a parody of itself at this point. Plus, scenes that feature Fleck and any member of the Wayne family feel like pandering to the Batman crowd rather. The cherry on top, of course, is the insinuation (true or false) that Fleck may actually be a Wayne family relation. Again, that's taking the ""easy way out"" when it comes to crafting this story.Fortunately, ""Joker"" does enough things right to make it watchable. It isn't boring by any means, the music and overall production value is great, and Phoenix does give a great performance. For the tone of the character that Phillips is trying to create, Phoenix is marvelous, actually.Overall, though, I only moderately enjoyed this take on the Joker mythos. Maybe, had this been the first attempt at doing so, I'd feel differently. But as it stands, it comes down to me liking other interpretations of the character more than this one."
3568,Still it's so over rated... As a viewer not critic I look at the final image of a movie I respect all aspect but I need no get out of it satisfied and am not talking about its genre.. .. Anyway good acting by joakim not that good movie story and plot...
3569,"I had been very excited to see this movie ever since I had 1st heard about it, and was anticipating its release.But when it started getting the type of hype and press that it was, I became a bit apprehensive, as the things that were being said about it, which seemed outrageous, mostly, were things that were said about other moves I had been looking forward to seeing, and that had ended letting me down.The Joker, sadly, turned out to be one of those movies for me.Now, as I know it has been said many times before, Phoenix's portrayal of man with mental health & depression was very very good & convincing.But the story and the plot seemed like a big missed opportunity to deliver an anti hero origin story of one of the most coveted villains in comic book lore.I liked the quasi mirroring of a failed system whose middle & lower class revolt against the rich, in a sort of ""if we burn, you burn with us"" type of way that has been done many times before.I'm sure people can see glimpses of that today in our US culture.And who knows, maybe the studio execs got their fingers involved, and are the ones that watered it down a bit too much.Maybe there will be a directors cut that is darker than the theatrical release.I certainly hope so.Because for all the reviews I have read that speak of people walking out of theaters because of the dark feel and psychological overtones being too much for them to stomach; all I felt was a sense of wanting it to be bigger and grander than what I was seeing.I would recommend seeing this movie so that you can formulate your own opinion, but I gave it a low rating, because when it was over, I walked out feeling like I just saw a movie I've already seen many times before."
3570,"The movie encourages to think. From the beginning, I knew that the film could be questionable to a certain extent.I just expected it to be different. Based on the joker image of Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight, I was convinced that the Joker would commit violence for the sake of chaos like Tyler Durden in Fight Club or boredom and pure narcissism like Patrick Bateman in American Psycho. 'Do I really look like a guy with a plan?' or 'some people just want to watch the world burn' are inseparably connected with the character for me. The Joker is crazy. But to become the symbol of a movement and to hide from the judiciary in the longer term, it also requires a certain genius.There is nothing like this to be seen or even implied in this movie. The Joker here is broken, deeply hurt and pitiful - very well acted though - but just not cunning. The good news is that he cannot inspire imitators like that."
3571,"As someone who dosent ussually watch superhero movies, especially dc, I had some doubts about joker, Joaquin Phoenix's oscar worthy performance makes this already an amazing film, its refreshing to see a superhero movie that dosent rely on cgi and fights to tell an amazing story"
3572,Brilliantly written and best acting I have ever seen of any actor. Joaquin Phoenix sir you have blown my mind.Hands off to you sir for what you have done.
3573,"I don't know why this movie is called Joker, it isn't really about the Joker. It is a movie about a man named Arthur who has mental issues and is constantly being s*** on by society. He has a job as a clown and loses that due to a jerk co worker and after that life just continues to go to hell for Arthur. Around about the last 15 mins of the movie, Arthur paints his face, dyes his hair green and I guess this is when he is supposedly the Joker now but all I was seeing was Arthur in face paint fully having lost his mind now.This movie was not needed, I went in with low expectations because I felt, much like Venom last year, this film wasn't really needed and it didn't tell an interesting enough story about the Joker. It's really just about an anorexic guy with mental problems who likes to parade around his apartment in nothing but his underwear and break out into a dance routine every five minutes. Then he becomes a lukewarm Joker in the last 15 mins. of the movie. So if that sounds interesting, then you will love this ""masterpiece""."
3574,"Pretty stretched out. Too boring, and the end just doesn't bring that ecstacy or feeling of how what happened. It's like somehow Joker's current charater on Batman movies had to be justified, so lets do it this way."
3575,"I desperately wanted to like Joker, as I love slow paced dramas, but man was it underwhelming. Everyone is saying that it was amazing and that it proves that DC can still make good movies, and that made me believe that this movie did everything right, but it didn't. I see all these reviews with a perfect ten, but with few actually good reasons. Joaquin Phoenix's acting, how there's no CGI, it's impactful and emotional. This is truly by far the most disappointing movie I have ever seen, and I believe everyone is just hopping on the bandwagon just because everyone says it's great. I hate to be the downer and sound like a critic, but I am logical and Joker is nowhere near a 10.Most of my favorite movies are slow paced and don't have any action. Movies like Into the Wild, Silence, and The Green Mile don't have any action scenes or anything entertaining, but it tells an emotional story, and that's what makes Joker fail for me. Joker is incredibly slow paced, and being slow paced is not a problem, it's only a problem when it feels like nothing is progressing. Yes, we see that Arthur is progressively losing his mind and transforming into Joker, but it took almost the entire runtime for Arthur to become Joker. The sad part is when Arthur becomes Joker, the movie is at it's best, it's what we came for, and we only got to see around fifteen minutes of Joker. If we had an entire hour of Joker, then the pacing would be perfect and it would be a perfect ten for me.If a movie is going to be slow paced, then your character(s) have to be well written. Making a character sympathetic and/or empathetic can make an amazing character, but Arthur is none of those things. I'm sorry, but a mentally ill clown getting beat up is not going to make me feel sympathetic. Your character has to likable and relatable to first be sympathetic, but Arthur Fleck was just written way too poorly. We know nothing about Arthur except that he wants to be a comedian and that he has a mental illness, and that's not enough to make a compelling character. There has to be well written motives in a character to be good enough for someone to care about them, but I struggled to find any within Arthur. Arthur does have motives, but it takes so long to get to them, and the motives are so clouded and beyond generic. I tried to piece together his plans and all I got was that he wants to be successful and make the world a better place; seriously? This is Joker, try to be more original and creative. If they didn't try to make Joker a sympathetic bad guy, then Joker would've ultimately been a better character.Joker is amazing when it comes to everything but the writing. It has amazing cinematography and atmosphere. The world building is just so perfect and they nailed Gotham. When it comes to that department, Joker did it perfectly. Another good part is the acting, which everyone loves to talk about. Joaquin Phoenix really gave it his all; he made Arthur so believable by the delivery of the lines, the laugh, and most importantly, the body language. What bothers me is that people are giving Joker a perfect score mainly because of Joaquin's performance, and we can all agree that it was amazing, but if that character is poorly written, then the performance is pretty much useless for the story.Joker tries to be something that it's not. They try and be like Shutter Island with the all twists that you should've seen coming, or that it's a character film and how it's an outlook on society, but Joker failed on all of those themes. Making a film that Joker wanted to be is hard; you need a good written story, which is then complemented with good written characters. As I've said, I hate being the downer, as all movies take a lot of hard work, and Joker isn't a bad movie, but it's sadly overrated. The best way that I can describe Joker is that it's style over substance."
3576,"Was bored through a lot of this. Anyone saying this is a ""masterpiece"" is just jumping on a band wagon. Rename it ""Arthur"" and remove a couple of references to Arkham and the Wayne family and no-one would say that it is in the Batman world... also very few people would have gone to see it."
3577,It's a very unoriginal film. just watch Taxi Driver and King of Comedy. it's basically a rip-off of those movies.
3578,"This movie is so bad; like incredibly bad. There is no plot other than the pity-party of a troubled man. Nothing exists beyond this in the form of character development: past, present, or future. Not even supporting characters provide relief. You can tell they just wanted to point a camera at an actor and tell them to act distressed and estranged then go home and call it art/film. The final straw was the fact that the Joker I have known is cunning and plans elaborate schemes. This ""joker"" could not even plan what is for dinner. He is just along for the ride and 180° from the true character. They could not have missed the mark more."
3579,This movie is overated. There was so much hype about it. I wasted 5 pounds renting this movie on amazon.
3580,"This movie from the start gives you this horror creepy vibe it contains scenes that's are hard to watch because of how intense they are this movie makes you feel for Arthur like if you were in his seat ,every detail about this film is impressive even the songs give each scene more of an effect ,love the way this movie was taken and the acting definitely is Oscar worthy"
3581,"The Joker is Batman's arch nemesis. ""Joker"" is a dark study of an unhinged personality, Arthur Fleck, and his devolution into the Joker without any mention of Batman as Bruce Wayne is still too young. When Jack Nicholson played the Joker in the original ""Batman"" in 1989 it was pure comical, later Heath Ledger upped the ante in ""The Dark Knight"" in 2008 by fusing in it more maniacal and intimidating energy and received an Oscar posthumously, but when Joaquin Phoenix plays the Joker he creates a universe of mayhem and hopelessness and draws you into his downward spiral journey. Truly, an Oscar worthy performance. Raising the bar further looks difficult as I think we have reached the limit of madness."
3582,"Great film.Phoenix was simply amazing and deserved the statue for his Rome. Intense. Layer upon layer of rich depth.An ending in a white room tgst presents interesting interpretations for the movie and the entirety of the Batman related films.If you lijexEtes Wide Shut on the first viewing, I think you'll enjoy this as well."
3583,"...and I loved every minute. The cinematography was perfect, the performances, especially that by Frances Conroy, were superb. I expected a brooding thriller, but instead was treated to a glimpse into a dark mind, and was able to witness (at least for me, an average person) the genesis of something diabolical yet relatable. I would give it 10 stars, but I think the editing was sloppy at times and there were clips that needed to stay on the floor. But all in all, a beautiful, jarring, wrenching film. I bought it and will buy it again in any higher resolution, when that day comes, and my finances afford."
3584,"Joaquin Phoenix really shines in this movie. His acting was phenomenal; every single expression, mannerism, dialogue and action shows a characteristic of Arthur and the Joker. The movie should be watched just for him.The plot was so and so, and there wasn't really a plot, but that hardly matters because Joaquin steals the show."
3585,"Joker: Brilliant. Mesmerising. 10/10 Brecht & Havel would be pleased. A satire on the stand-up insanity, Marvel movie dross, TV comedy hosts on late night tv, corrupt America, the contributions of Robin Williams, Jim Carey & Charlie Chaplin to civilisation, with references to Taxi Driver, Midnight Cowboy & Network. Serious film representing good theatre and writing is back....I hope. Phoenix is superb. I did not want to take my eyes off him in case I missed a facial twitch or expression. He builds on Heath Ledger's Joker and takes it to the stratosphere and beyond. It will be too close to home for a lot of Americans who don't want to face up to obscene wealth, homelessness, mental illness, poor medical cover and gun insanity. But see it.....it's marvellous! Ha hah haaaaah! Hah haaaaaa!"
3586,"I honestly started an account simply to review this truly awful film. I dont know what all the 10 star reviewers watched, but it certainly couldn't have been the same Joker I just watched bc this was absolute trash. Save your time and watch something, nay, watch literally ANYTHING, else.Yeah, Joaquin is a great actor but if I have to hear that cringey laugh even one more time I'm gonna barf. Yeah, the music was good... if you enjoy the same four or five scales played over and over and over and over and over. Just skip the whole damn thing."
3587,"** spoilers **
It used to be movies with 8.7 ratings were actually good. It seems not so anymore.
As a fan of Batman series and batman in general--I do highly rate Christopher Nolan's batman trilogy and even Tim Burton's version, I was quite curious, given the high praise and high Imdb ratings, what kind of story they have to tell of the Joker. Will there be any surprises, would it be interesting?.It turns out, not so much.Let me talk about the good first.
1. Great acting. We have Joachin Phoenix, a pro actor, who I loved best in the fantastic movie Gladiator, gives his all in his role as the Joker. That is if he has any lines to say.
2. Good cinematography. The movie has great photography and gives it that moody, dark look of Gotham.Now let me talk about the bad.
1. Mediocre story.
The story itself can be summed up in this synopsis. Arthur Fleck was born with a condition which makes him laugh. Life treats him bad and he goes over the edge and becomes the Joker. That's the story.Forgive me, but I think that Jack Nicholson transformation to Joker was more reasonable than this story. At least in Tim Burton's batman, Joker was already crazy and a member of a criminal gang. Besides, people in the real world, with bigger problems that Arthur Fleck don't turn into homicidal, crazed lunatics who just shoots anybody in sight. So his transformation doesn't make any logical sense.2. Poor dialog and writing.
Joker, who is supposed to be a villain of super high IQ seems to not show it at all in this movie. I would think that any person with exceptional IQ would display it in works or his words. But in this movie, what does he do which demonstrates his intelligence? Nothing I can remember. In fact there doesn't seem to be much talking in the whole movie by any character at all. Even in the great Robert De Niros role, had nothing much to do ro say. That's poor writing and the characteristic of this whole movie. If they have nothing to say maybe they should have waited for more ideas before pushing this half-baked show where nothing happens.All in all, this movie is an example of how far writing talent and dialog have fallen since the good old days of the Batman trilogy. I'd rather recommend just watch a rerun of Dark Knight if you want to see a proper joker and a good story.Not recommended at all."
3588,"There appears to be sharply divided reactions to this film. Reading some of the other reviews, people thought it was brilliant, or a piece of garbage.
My own opinion - I hated it. The best aspect of Joker is Joaquin Phoenixs' acting. He did a great job with a crappy script and a mostly incoherent story. Forget any relation to the Heath Ledger portrayal of Joker, which was smart and perfectly played. This version of Joker has little to do with Batman, although there are scattered connections in the film.
I'm sorry I watched this. Guess I hoped it would get better, but for me, it just stayed at awful throughout."
3589,"Joker doesn't deserve such a high score. I think it's a troublesome movie. The proposal is to be a great Oscar movie, but it just pretends to be. It doesn't have the elegance, intelligence, right idea for that."
3590,"Brilliant Film! Deserves a 10 rating!
There are also themes about the effect of loss, love, and friendship going in the proceedings here."
3591,"If you haven't watched this movie then your missing out big time.Heath Ledger done a amazing job as the Joker in the Dark Knight.
In this Movie Joaquin Phoenix plays the Joker and he done a excellent job, he starved himself so that he could play the part and that deserves mad props. In this film the Joker is way more dark
and creepy. The movie at first can be a little confusing for some people but a second watch will fix that.Thank you for reading my review."

3596,One of the best movies I've ever seen. I strongly recommend everyone to look and enjoy in the awesome acting and story. Well done!!!
3597,"The best Joker I ever seen... deep, dark, fragile, confuse, dangerous, .... insane..."
3598,"This is just an excellent movie, and we finally get to know the true origins and motivations of the infamous killer. In reality, Arthur Fleck never intended to become a villain, He just wanted to be accepted into society and live a fair life. Gotham City created it's own villain. Arthur Fleck's character development is sensational as he slowly falls into an abyss of insanity, as he becomes the character we all know as JOKER.Batman is the hero the city WANTS, Joker is the hero the city DESERVES"
3599,"The only emotion I was able to understand after watching this film for the first time was disturbed. It invoked one of the longest and thought-provoking conversations I've had after watching a film. One of the biggest being its portrayal of mental illness, which may have been the most realistic I've seen, and the graphic violence. Only after watching it a second time did I realize how little violence there is in the film. The way Todd Phillips was able to make the viewer feel so strongly about the protagonist's journey throughout is a testament to him, Joaquin Phoenix and anyone involved in the film, especially the way the cinematographer used colors. It balanced an original story and comic book origin story flawlessly and after the second viewing, was able to look past it's 'not so' graphic nature and understand everything Arthur was going through and was somehow able to empathize and disagree with a character at the same time as they slipped into madness. This may be one of the most important works of mainstream art in our time."
3600,"I'll do my best to explain why I was disappointed in this film without giving away spoilers about the film. My favorite portrayal of the Joker was Heath Ledger's Joker followed by Jack Nicholson's portrayal. Joker is the Clown prince of Crime, why... because he isn't driven by money... he is a psychopath driven by brilliance and a psychotic twisted sence of humor. His ultimate goal is chaos.I found Phoenix's Joker had only one of these qualities... he became psychotic. He was a comedian without a sense of humor. His portrayal of Arthur was that of a moderately retarded abused individual, not a brilliantly deranged human that Ledger's joker embodied perfectly. That's why the movie completely missed the mark for me."
3601,"Director Todd Phillips' origin story stars Joaquin Phoenix in a dark, gritty fairy tale as to how the Joker of DC Comics fame, became the number one criminal of Gotham City. Phillips likens Gotham to a New York City of the very early 80s, replete with rampant crime, a garbage strike, rats, Joe Franklin-like TV shows, graffiti laden subway cars and VCRs.
The Joker's decompensation is shown in increments as he devolves into criminality and madness. The main strike against him is that he never moved out of his mother's apartment and takes care of his demented elderly mother, who has a long history of mental health issues. Eventually, in a scene where he's able to illegally extract an old report from the state mental hospital, he learns that his mother used to work for (now) mayoral candidate, Gotham's power broker Thomas Wayne (father of Bruce, who eventually became Batman). It appears that the mother developed the delusion that Wayne impregnated her and that the Joker is actually Wayne's illegitimate son.
The Joker ends up paying a visit to the Wayne mansion where he encounters little Bruce and chokes Alfred the Butler, after not being allowed in to see Thomas Wayne. Soon afterward, he's able to sneak into a concert hall where he punches the elder Wayne who's just finished relieving himself in the bathroom.
Phillips also fills in the backstory of the Joker's daily life in which he constantly finds himself laughing inappropriately in public (it's later brought out he sustained a brain injury after his mother's boyfriend smashed his head in against a radiator when he was a child). The Joker even has a card made up which he gives to strangers whenever he's subject to these laughing outbursts, explaining the origin of this peculiar neurological condition.
There's quite a bit more dark stuff we end up privy to--including how the Joker loses his Rent-a-Clown job after he drops a gun at a hospital where he's entertaining children (a co-worker had given him the gun after a bunch of punks assault him while he's working as a street performer) as well as how he murders three Wall Street types on a subway train after they taunt and beat him up.
The Joker also develops a thing for Sophie, the next door neighbor who has a young daughter. Phillips does well in showing how The Joker deludes himself into believing that he has developed some kind of romantic relationship with her. He even imagines Sophie visiting him and mother at the hospital, after she has a stroke.
For all the imagined scenarios, reality intrudes. There's a scene where Sophie confronts him and asks whether the Joker has been following her. And later he breaks into her apartment and when she comes home, the Joker asks her, ""You're Sophie, right?"" as if in reality, he hardly knew her. When he leaves the apartment, we're left wondering if he ended up murdering his neighbor but Phillips wisely keeps it a mystery.
All in all, Phillips is intent on portraying a man who is gradually losing his grip on reality and becoming more and more violent. The Joker even ends up suffocating his mother with a pillow, causing her death. But Phillips unfortunately wants it both ways: as much as how he adroitly depicts how the Joker became the master criminal he came to be, he also attempts to evoke sympathy for him by depicting society (both the community and government) besieged by a simplistic, fascistic mentality and morality.
Phillips draws a moral equivalence between the Joker's criminality (perhaps excused by so-called mental illness) and a society motivated by promoting the haves over the have-nots. The Joker is a perennial victim beginning with Thomas Wayne who not only has no toleration for lawlessness and will use any means necessary in cracking down on the disenfranchised but has no sympathy for the Joker (who's convinced that Thomas is his father).
There are no moderates in Phillips' comic book world. The Joker's therapy sessions must be discontinued due to government cuts (they obviously no longer have resources or patience for the disenfranchised). The Joker's co-worker (whom he eventually stabs to death) believes only in vigilante justice and gives him the gun with the proviso that he pay him back out of his salary.
The three upstanding Wall Street guys who end up beating the Joker up on the train, do so without mercy, and he responds by executing them. The Joker's life-long dream of becoming a standup comedian is fulfilled after he's invited on to the Murray Franklin (Robert DeNiro) Show but this is only after the show's producers utilize earlier clips of the Joker performing at a comedy club, in order to mock him.
The Joker becomes a movement when he executes Murray Franklin on live TV and then is hailed as a hero by criminals who now regard him as some sort of savior. As much as Phillips may abhor the violence of those who advocate class warfare on the basis of income inequality, he also revels in the violence by harping on it and depicting the Joker as some kind of victim.
The denouement is also unsatisfying as Phillips suggests that after The Joker is locked up at the state mental hospital, this whole story might have been a figment of his imagination. That way I suppose Phillips can escape accusations of promoting a moral equivalency between criminality fueled by mental illness and an indifferent, one dimensional fascistic society."
3602,"Joaquin Phoenix flawlessly acted the part he was given and I give all my 5 stars to his acting abilities. However, who is the Joker and what should his character portray? I did some research online and here is what I found from more seasoned comic book nerds, far more qualified than me:
""The Joker is a homicidal, psychopathic, ruthless, sadistic, maniacal, lunatic, manipulative, intelligent and diabolical master criminal who wants nothing but chaos and anarchy wherever he goes, as well as reveling in the suffering of others"".
Now, despite Joaquin displaying an amazing performance, I asked myself one question - By the end of the movie, do I see anything close to a supervillain? My answer to that is NO. Sure this Joker is mentally unwell and you feel sad for him. But is he a manipulative, intelligent and diabolical master criminal? Hardly, instead he is portrayed as rather unintelligent and lacking of many qualities that a master criminal would require. What about his age in this movie? What is he, 45? So how old is he when Bruce becomes Batman - 60+?
I see this as a good movie for displaying the progression of a mentally unwell person but a bad portrayal of the Joker."
3603,"I like to consider myself an overall fan of the comic book world and generally love every film that comes out. I went with my partner to see this in the cinema and well felt underwhelmed and close to feeling I've wasted my money in going to the cinema. I like Phoenix a lot, I be honest I didn't see many trailers before going to cinema as I didn't want to have to many spoilers and stayed away from reviews. But looking at this site seeing so many giving this film a 10 out 10 I started to think did I even see the same film. I'm my honest opinion and I'm not going to use big words and make this review complicated to read but the film was boring. I think for a 2 hour film an hour was worth watching and about half hour of that had was Phoenix at his best. Phoenix did truly brought a new depth to the character Joker and I can't knock his performance. I wasn't after massive action sequences but the film just didn't flow, to many quite moments with nothing really happening. To many parts of the film really didn't need to be in it and was a complete was of time in viewing. But all this is my opinion but honestly not an Oscar winning film. Maybe just maybe Oscar for Phoenix as best Actor but I truly think it would be a nomination, sorry just my thoughts."
3604,"I was not sure going into this film if i was going to find it entertaining. I do have a soft spot for everything Batman related but that stopped short of the Joker. This film is simply spectacular. Phoenix absolutely stole the show, what an amazing artist. I didn't read any reviews before watching, just listened to friends who had watched it and highly recommended it. This is a must see film."
3605,There is nothing to say about the entire film... it's just PERFECT!
3606,It's a outstanding performance by joaquin playing the Joker! But the movie is a bit boring and the story a bit to easy... would love to had more action
3607,"First of all, Joker is a masterpiece.I don't have an account prior to this movie but because of the stupid reviews by the critics, I felt that I have to sign up for an account and write a good review for Joker.If Star Wars Last Jedi can get 91% rating at Rotten Tomatoes, how can Joker only get 68%?I understand movies are subjective but based on all the users reviews, everyone is saying it's a masterpiece and most users are giving a perfect 10. How can it score lesser than a ""trashy"" movie like Last Jedi?Are the critics the only ones with the brains or artistic appreciation to rate movies? It's like we the users are all stupid, don't know how to appreciate movies and have no clue what a good movie is.Hey critics, you guys are the REAL JOKERS."
3608,Sometimes... a masterpiece is made and some of us are not ready to accept it
3609,"Sheds a light on how powerful and ""taboo"" this subject still is and looked down upon. Namaste Phoenix. BRILLIANT."
3610,I'm lost for words! What a movie and what a performance from Joaquin Phoenix! Oscar!
3611,"First of all I'd like to say ""HATS OFF TO TODD PHILIPS AND JOAQUIN PHOENIX"". If you're a cinephile and haven't seen this movie on the bug screen, you're missing something!
The movie explores the life of Arthur Fleck and shows us how an ordinary man becomes the JOKER.
Daringly dark, this movie left me and many others speechless! No one was clapping when it ended, because the movie itself is a slap on the face of society! Everyone EVERYONE is a result of circumstances. This movie doesn't care about anything, it doesn't sugarcoat lies, it doesn't confuse reality with fiction, it takes the reality and puts a fictous yet amazingly real-like story in it! Do we take mental illness seriously? NO. Does this movie warns us of the consequences? YES. Should we relate to this movie and feel sympathy for Joker? NO. You know what ignorance and suppression leads to? It leads to JOKER!
Coming to the cinematic aspects of the movie, believe me when I say this, ""Joaquins acting was TOP TIER""! Credit goes to Todd Philips too for creating an amazing yet dark environment and daring to implement this story! Cinematography was on point and in fact one of the best that I've seen! I'm saying this again because no matter how many tines I say this it won't be enough, Joaquin acted as if he WAS Joker! This performance tops that of ""Her"" and will always live in cinematic history as one of the best EVER!
It would be needless to say that you should see this because YOU SHOULD SEE THIS!
Talking about my experience in cinema, I was shocked and SHAKING when the movie ended! The last 15 mins of the movie were one of the finest and intense piece of cinema ever made!
Joker shakes the society, slaps it's face, and puts forward a question, ""Where are we going as a society?"""
3612,"This movie is beautiful. The message they deliver is immediately felt: it's portraying our society as a whole in the movie. This shows us exactly how some people are treated with disrespect, and being completely isolated as if they're not even a human being.
Not only that, but Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal as Arthur Flex is astounding. You can see the high amount of time, and effort he's put on to being this character. He really hits home in the laughing, shows Arthur's struggles immensely with society in every scene. Phoenix also does an amazing job showing the descent into madness slowly, which just makes you feel even more terrible for the character Arthur Fleck, and what society had done to him. He really might've made Heath Ledger smiling down at him, saying: ""you've restored my Joker legacy"".
Speaking of the descent into Joker, that was also handled very well. We first start off seeing Arthur as a weak, willed character. He slowly walks up the stairs in a weird, almost saddened way. He has a shaky voice, and almost zero confidence in himself. Arthur was pretty much broken down: a human that society treated as non-existent.
However, when he becomes Joker, we immediately see he's happy as can be, dancing to his own music in his head down the steps as shown in the trailer and the movie. He actually feels more confident, not scared to express himself, albeit in a twisted way of course.I suggest you give this masterpiece a watch, you won't regret it."
3613,"I laughed, felt sad, pity, joy and fear all in one movie. This deserves a place in the top 10 movie's of all time."
3614,"Very bad movie , the story has been changed , too much violence, especially killing his mother was too much . Not happy at all !"
3615,I thought nobody can replace Heath Ledger but it was performance of a lifetime by Mr. Phoenix.
3616,"Wonderful movie! Probably the best I've ever seen. It's dark, gloomy and very realistic. Don't expect a comic book action movie. It was so real and Joaquin Phoenix's performance was absolutely perfect. For the record, I'm not a ""fan girl"" or a dc fanatic. I just love this movie"
3617,Trailer spoiled the movie.. i hope there will be sequel
3618,"I went into this moving having little to no expectations , but the performance and the story of arthur moved me , i enjoyed every minute , My advice to people who are thinking about watching the movie , is to go for it since it will not dissapoint"
3619,"Nothing much to say except, this is what cinema should be. An amazing film and the performance of a lifetime by Joaquin Phoenix! Arthur's further descent into madness portrayed perfectly. We can all identify with sadness, Phoenix's performance makes you sympathize with this disturbed, neglected man. This was the best film I have seen in a long time."
3620,"The Joker has always been Batman's main nemesis and he was also the single best character in the best Batman movie ever made: Dark Knight-so why shouldn't he have his own movie? Of course, this version of Joker won't be Heath Ledger nor Jack Nicholson, and thank God it's not Jared Leto. This rendition of Joker would be Joaquin Phoenix and I think he did a fine job.This movie was the making of Joker--his backstory. What they did so well was create a mood. From the beginning the mood was set as somber, dark, despondent. Through the music, the camera shots, and the setting you got a feel of the environment that hatched the Joker. Gotham City was such that any person could have gone mad especially someone with just the right push.The Joker was not born from a big bang like so many superheroes and supervillains. He was born from a series of small infractions, tiny iniquities, micro-offenses. Each little occurrence chipped away at his already fragile psyche.By the time he'd reached Joker level insanity, it wasn't a flood gate that opened within him. His personality didn't dramatically change. We merely saw the man that we had glimpses of throughout the entire movie. When the door opened for the Joker to come out, he didn't storm out with megalomaniac level schemes and plans, he walked out with one simple plan and one simple target that just so happened to light the wick to a powder keg that was Gotham City.The Joker didn't create the conditions under which he was made and under which Gotham City became a war zone. The Joker was what many of the Gothamites were waiting for and didn't know it. The city was simmering and bubbling just waiting to boil over when the Joker provided that final spark.It was brilliantly done. The pacing, although slow at times, was even. The story was very cohesive with no noticeable gaps or flaws. The setting and the mood was pitch perfect. And the performance by Phoenix, which was a different Joker from his predecessors, was magnifique. He wasn't the effervescent Joker that we may be familiar with and it made sense. He was passive-aggressive, slightly muted, definitely delusional, and set to explode. He was outstanding."
3621,"Believe the hype, instant classic! this movie is one of the best movies you'll see in a long time.. The acting was from another planet. Joaquin deserves a statue! and director Todd shows how to make movies again. Quality cinema! for the Batman fans there is also a lot to find...if you want to know why Gotham sucks and why Batman was needed (Dark Night Batman) go and see this movie. If you are not interested in Batman you can still go and see it as a stand alone masterpiece. 10 of 10!Warner Bros, Todd and Joaquin! congratulations. Thanks for this one!The end is EPIC!!!"
3622,"So everything you have heard about Phoenix's performance is deserved. It is by far one of the greatest efforts to tell a man's slide into despair and unhinged madness ever put to film. The comparisons to Taxi Driver especially and King of Comedy serve the movie well. In the same way that De Niro's Travis Bickell was socially inadequate and awkward and could not relate to people is here with Fleck too. Fleck is a physically twisted desicated husk of wretched failure, and crucially like Bickel his journey is hard to watch and you genuinely feel bad, almost guilty watching him as entertainment. However this is where the story begins to fail. The film completely lacks any degree of subtlety in telling the Jokers story. It may not be fair drawing such a blatant comparison to Taxi Driver but then the film is so unapologetically influenced by it, it revels in going into great detail about his origins and his tragic childhood. This is where the Ledger's Joker succeeds so well. He lied so much, he was a planner when he said he wasn't, he told conflicting stories about his scars and most effectively of all, he was utterly unpredictable and dangerous. I remember having a feeling of dread as to what mad lethal craziness he was going to do next and you did believe him when he said he was an 'agent of chaos'. At no point in Joker did I sense this, you have a pretty good idea of what he will do even when the film tries to indicate he may choose another path. Crucially Phoenix's joker lacks mystery. Everything is so explained there is not the possibility for the audience to use their own imagination as to his horrendous past.
Phoenix absolutely deserves all the praise he is getting, he breathes Fleck with such visceral rawness he makes him both equally captivating and painful to watch. The film itself is beautifully designed, the soundtrack matches the mood and tone and the cinematography is especially impressive. It's such a shame the story let the story down so to speak but the film did do what a great film should and leave an impression. My friends and I were left talking about the film long after it finished which is what a great film should do. Worth seeing for sure."
3623,Intense thrilling and pure class loved every minute of this blockbuster by DC
3624,"JOKER - A massive justification for DC Fans,

It's time to put a smile on Thier faces :)🃏JOKER - a rebel of the decaying Society, he is inside all of US🌟"
3625,"After keeping us at the edge of our seats with his stunning and ravishing performance in Christopher Nolan masterpiece the Dark Knight. Director Tod Phillip brings him back in his own standalone movie Joker which is no doubt a finest and marvelous direction in present time. A story about a lonely comediam Aurthur Fleck who is failed in his life. Isolated, bullied and disregarded by society, Fleck begins a slow descent into madness as he transforms into the criminal mastermind known as the Joker.Please do not miss this masterpiece at any cost"
3626,There was nothing redeeming about this terrible film. It wasn't entertaining and even Phoenix's acclaimed performance isn't that good. I just don't get it. How a piece of crap like this made so much money. I could not wait for it to end.
3627,"The acting was great but Oscar movies are a mess. They drag you only for the acting. And talking. And crying. I was expecting more of a vilan than 12 monkey kind of a movie. I almost felt asleep 3 times. Not worth my money at the theater. Like I said, acting is good but the movie drags itself and storyline was not brought well. My first review but I am a movieholic so this is not the first movie I watched"
3628,"I found this movie as slow drama, the funny parts are: the dwarf cant reach the lock on the door to leave, and the ending, where he is interviewed by Maury. Other than that, this isn't a real edge of your seat action film. The movie is mostly a prologue to joker before batman. It would be interesting to see a better film come out of this, with LOTS of action with joker being Diabolical!"
3629,"This movie was drug out way beyond the amount of time it should have taken. The story line is good, but there are alot of scenes that just seem to drag out for way longer than they need to. Im not really a huge fan of Pheonix, but gave the movie a fair chance still. Plot was decent. Performance was sub par at best. I would not recommend this movie to anyone unless they are just wanting to waste time."
3630,"This movie is a note for note rip off of Taxi Dirver and King of Comedy, only it is utterly lacking in substance."
3631,"""Joker"" has received a ton of attention--and controversy--in recent weeks, with strong reviews from the Venice Film Festival leading up to a Golden Lion win, but increasingly divisive and polarized reviews after that. I was very excited for this film because I really like Joaquin Phoenix, and was especially interested in the idea of doing a character study-style take on the comic book movie that would theoretically feel unique to most of the other, CGI action-filled ones. Don't get me wrong, some more traditional comic book movies are very entertaining, but I thought that this could be a fresh take on the genre. Sadly, I was wrong.Much has been said about Phoenix's performance, and I will say that he is quite strong here. He looks somewhat unlike his normal self, as in remarkably thin and frail--and convincingly plays the part of a genuinely disturbed man caught in the desire to seek attention solely to augment his own psychotic state. His fits of laughter sound both funny and depraved, and you can tell that he truly immersed himself in character. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is extremely disappointing. The film's plot is rather generic--that is, when the movie has substantive plot points. With the exception of one scene, there are not many key plot points in the first two-thirds of the film. As a result, the film starts to feel stale and extremely repetitive after a while. We know that Phoenix will continue to gradually lose his mind, but what else are we supposed to take away from this, especially since the film's supporting characters are uninteresting and often underdeveloped? The film tries to be a homage to some of Martin Scorsese's earlier films such as ""The King of Comedy"" and ""Taxi Driver,"" but ends up feeling like a disingenuous knockoff rather than a clever homage to Scorsese. Even though the film's idea of making a famous comic book villain into a dark psychological drama/thriller sounds ""original,"" the actual film itself regrettably does not feel original at all. The script is generally fine, but it fails to give Phoenix as much of a range as he should have in this role. (However, he does incredibly well working with what he has.) The film is also poorly edited at times, with ringing noises and music sometimes juxtaposing or intruding on what should be key moments based on character and dialogue, rather than sound design--although, to its credit, there are moments of strong cinematography and lighting. While some will like it--hence the divisive reception--I was deeply disappointed. 4/10Note: I saw the film in Dolby Cinema. The film's picture and sound quality were greatly enhanced in this format."
3632,"Absolutely the worst movie I have seen in a long time.
So dark and pointless.
Boring until 90 min in and then just gory, depressing, and dark.
Don't waste your time."
3633,"The Joker navigates in that sea, being a descending path. But the related thread that guides him in a true way is not found. Madness, plagued with superficiality, not by Phoenix's performance, but by forcing his way, trying to justify his feeling and acting, giving an overrated power to injustice, inequality and hypocrisy. The film tries to give the same place to a rebellious society, fighting for a justice that tries to derive the unjust power of the system, centered on the rich, to make them suffer. But just as the path of the Joker is forced, so is the path of this suffered society. It is like a black drop in the sea that instead of being diluted multiplies."
3634,"The acting and cinematic experience is fantastic. This movie is so dark that its uncomfortable to watch. In so many ways it's a good joker, and in even more ways it's an awful joker. This was a blank slate,they had the opportunity to give us a great joker orgin movie instead it's a character study of a guy going crazy. There's no story,no villains, no plot, nothing. Don't waste your money."
3635,"If you like watching 2 hours of dark depressing material with little or no plot or memorable scenes then this is for you. Yes I know it's a character study but I think a film should be entertaining in some way or other, there's even no light relief from the gloom. One boring scene to the next. I'd say avoid. How it's running at 9 on IMDb I'm not sure"
3636,"Dumbest movie in the history, not worth it.
Its crazy how theres not a single female made movie nominated but sure this garbage is"
3637,"Suck balls
To long
Depressed
Nothing happens
I don't understand why people like this movie"
3638,Too boring to have a good review. I slept in some moments
3639,"Yes, this is a Joaquin Phoenix art & character study movie, hence the 2 stars, both deservedly his but everything else didn't work, starting with the title and who he is supposed to turn into. After 30 minutes even his acting became stale. I nodded off for 5 minutes.Wait for the DVD or stream it but just for Phoenix's acting. The connect between his portrayal and the DC/Batman villain is so thin, the film would have worked better not having the connection. In fact, the connection actually makes the film less credible, the lack of logic associated to mental illness is completely lacking.Ultimately, bad writing and directing and that connect with DC were why it didn't work. The film should have been called ""Bulber"" or ""Comic""DeNiro, was wasted and has gone by way of Willis. Needed the money, were you doing Carson? Wrong!!!Maybe the writer and director should have taken a psych course or a seminar on pyschosis and bulber-affect syndrome before they wrote this drivel or considered the comic book, movie(s), TV series or anything DC or Batman & Joker dynamic we're about, one way or the other could have worked but you can't have your cake & eat it too."
3640,I just watched the movie and I literally choked of how bored I was jesus good performance by Joaquin for the rest it's not but trash tragic story about a tragic clown I would rather watch Suicide Squad then this
3641,But tollywood movie kalki was realy good thrilling and last end was suprising its wonderfully directed.
3642,I give Joker the same score as the amount of times I fell asleep during it.
3643,"Awful and lazy screenplay. Awful filmmaking. No subtlety. Terrible direction. Poor use of cinematography. Bland characters. Really had to showhorn the Wayne family somehow in the movie huh? They didn't need to be a part of it. Period. Joaquin tries his best to make this movie good but fails. This is not as good as these people are making you believe. It's worse. Much much worse. Doesn't deserve to be on top 250 either. The best comic book movie of this year remains the masterpiece that was Avengers: Endgame. Watch that instead of this garbage. Love how people are giving it a 10/10 just because it has Joker. If this was any other movie, it wouldn't have received such positive reviews."
3644,"Of course that this movie does not deserve 1, however i can not allow that it is better placed than Forrest Gump. It deserves 8.1"
3645,"This is my first review ,because i cant believe how you messed up a villian like this and how this movie is 55 000 000 ? I can make the same movie with the junkies from my hood for 2 beers...You should change the title Clown cuz i dont see the Joker here only one crackhead who is searching for job and kissing with a midget."
3646,"This is clearly not my kind of movie.
I thought it was bad and slow.I've seen better."
3647,"We all know that Joaquin Phoenix plays sicko characters like Commodus and others very well. So there were no surprising revelations of his talent in Joker - more like: 'here we go again!' His Ma played by Frances Conroy looked old enough to be his sister so that part was a bit implausible. I found the lack of action/excitement so tedious I walked out just as the height-challenged character was struggling to get out of Arthur's slaughterhouse. The rave reviews and high IMDb rating convinced me this would be a great, entertaining movie. It was so NOT"
3648,"This movie is nothing but a seriously mentally ill man imagining he's more important than he really is. He wishes he could be The Joker.. when in reality he's an invisible and pathetic nobody.
Arthur Fleck has no cunning, no charisma and absolutely no villainy in one bone of his body. How exactly is someone with an IQ of 94 supposed to become a super villain? He can't even spit out a sentence without straining. Come the frick on.
Also, joker will be 75 when Bruce Wayne becomes Batman? Kay.
Just skip this.. it's just one long, ""and everyone stood up and clapped"" tragedy."
3649,"Do not waste a penny on this utter pile of plop, seriously it is one of the worst films I have seen for a long long time!"
3650,"Most plots in the film you see it miles away, like joker's mom that joke is Wayne's son, joker kill talk show host and the relationship joker have with a black girl is nothing but an illusion. The whole story is really blatant and flat, whole tension inside the story was build only by loud music. Almost fall asleep during the film. If you have watched any of the movie trailers you have already see the whole film."
3651,"I was so hyped to see this movie considering what DC accomplished with all three Dark Knight movies. I let my guard down when it comes to DC Films, BIG MISTAKEJoker recieved so much hype because the movie studio spent a large portion of Jokers marketing budget engineering public opinion. Its the only rational thing I can think because Joker is nothing but a giant crap. Forty five minutes into the film I wanted to walk out of the movie theaterJoaquin Phoenix would laugh at awkward times and did this alot through the entire film. It never gave you a sense that Joker was starting to crack. Instead you feel that the director was telling Joaquin ""Laugh now"" just to remind the viewing audience that Joker is crazy. It was so stupid.Mr. Phoenix is getting so much praise for his portrayal of Joker yet to be totally honest it stunk. Heath Ledger's joker was better and more realistic. In fact all three dark knight movies were better than Joker in every aspect especially the realism department.Joker is one of those movies that 3 months from now when the movie studio has stopped the social media manipulation the truth of how bad the movie really is will shine through.Congratulations DC you Hoodwinked Comic book movie nerds once again including me."
3652,This could quite possibly one of the best movies ever made and wont quite get that recognition because its based off of comic books. Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely fantastic in portraying a character who is portrayed as crazy generally but in this film it shows his descent into madness. Its dark and deals with mental illness themes and though its part of the Batman universe id argue it wouldnt fit that well into Batman films. Its a must watch if only for Pheonix as the Joker and De Niro as Murray Franklin who is the late night chat show host and the last half hour in particular is such compelling viewing
3653,"A story about some guy who is spat on by society to only become some greater inspiration for a bunch of morons. Joker indeed does a good job interpreting today's downsizing of both American and European cultures. Plus, it perfectly points out that political factions like BLM or Antifa are the clowns of society and are the unneeded of existence itself. Let that sink in. As for the movie itself, it was an ok interpretation of Joker. Joker is pretty much a character that can be interpreted in many different ways which makes him a unique in general. I wasnt at all enthusiastic with this one but it wasn't too shabby. Better than most movies of today but that's not saying much."
3654,"I cannot have been the only one worried about ""Joker"". With our most recent cinematic Joker being disastrous in Suicide Squad, a director (Todd Phillips) best known for the mixed-bag that is the Hangover Trilogy and with Warner Bros's tendency to take popular characters and miss the mark completely (Fantastic Beasts' Dumbledore anyone?), the odds were certainly not in Jokers favour.Joker follows Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) a depressed 'clown for hire' who has pseudobulbar affect, a condition summarised by a card he hands out which defines it as sudden, 'frequent uncontrollable laughter that does not match how he feels'. Arthur aspires to appear on a talk show hosted by his idol Murray Franklin (Robert de Niro) yet finds himself living in a depressed tower block with his mother (Frances Conroy) and their neighbour Sophie (Zazie Beetz). However, due to events eerily similar to those in real life, Arthur begins a transformation into a man that will haunt the city of Gotham for decades to come.The first praise Joker must receive is that of its lead. Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal. He manages to do the unthinkable and provide a performance that rivals the late Heath Ledger, whom many consider as the definitive Joker. Regardless of whether the scene involves shocking acts of violence, moments of true tragedy or even interpretive dance in a bathroom, Phoenix manages to depict precisely where Arthur is on his journey to becoming the Joker. However, nearly everything else about this film deserves to be praised. From its directing, which deliberately places a constant state of tension and dread on the audience, to its score which blends joyous circus music with creepy drones to provide a hauntingly unique experience that could only work when dealing with the clown prince of crime.The beauty of Jokers' story, and an aspect I feel a lot of the recent controversy surrounding the film has missed, is that whilst you do support and empathise with Arthur, you are ultimately rooting for him not to snap under the weight of his life. This relates heavily to Joker's theme of distorting comedy into a dark, unsettling tragedy, as even though by the film's close Arthur will have finally found something to truly laugh about, it will still be a mournful end to his character. However, this is not to say that the plot is simple, on the contrary, by respecting its comic-book source, Joker's storyline runs deeper than a 500-word review can detail and thus lends itself to multiple different interpretations. Therefore, by refusing to provide a definitive origin story, it allows the audience to use the film as a start point to come up with their own theories and origins for the infamous character.Ultimately, Joker potentially signifies the dawn of a new type of comic-book movie. One that steps away from the loud, action-packed explosions of the MCU and instead takes a quieter, yet more adult approach on what would drive a man to evolve into one of the most infamous villains of the 20th and 21st centuries."
3655,"Every once in a while a movie comes along that takes away all of your creative ambitions as it has been put together so perfect, so smart, visually outstanding and performed excellently that you feel there is no point creating anything else. It can't be topped.
This movie is a piece of art. To appreciate this movie to that extend you'll need to have an experienced soul that understands human emotion beyond any grey area.
It's awesome how the creators play with this knowledge. Even when you think something is off it will make sense at some point.
This movie makes the Joker origin story absolutely believable for me. I love how it plays and how well it blends with some of the original Batman storylines.
There is much more to appreciate, but I wont say anything else."
3656,"This movie was amazing. From minute one I was hooked. I saw this movie very late and I am now upset I saw it so late. I love his take on the joker and he has a close running for best joker next to the late great Heath Ledger. If you haven't seen this, be ready for a very dark story, but please bare with it. Its fantastic."
3657,"Bruce wayne in joker actually reflects reality of the world. People like him are innocent, haven't done anything but still have to suffer a lot"
3658,"This is a amazing point of view of the joker because the joker. A man driven insane by the cause of this family and the way Gotham city was, The joker is more then just a madman he has a story that behind all of that. All I can say is 10/10 and I hope we see more of this joker!!!
Hahahaha"
3659,"There are so many things I can say about this film. The first being how much I appreciate DC for producing this film. Many large Studio names have a tendency for getting involved in the creative aspect of movies and sometimes ruining the original director's plan. But from the looks of it, it seems DC simply let go and allowed the filmmakers to do whatever they wanted. Whatever they did, it was the right decision.
This project is not merely about the comic book character they say it is. This character feels like a real person. The writing in this film is beyond acceptable and kept me engaged all the way through. The personal story about Arthur Fleck can hit you hard and make you feel and understand exactly what he is going through. I have never experienced anything he has done or felt before in his way. But the way they execute it, makes me feel like I AM HIM, and if not that than feel bad for him.
Along with this, Joaquin Phoenix's performance was an overachievement. And to think that there was a lot of pressure on the guy, being that there was another actor who played Joker who won an Oscar prior.
You would not think that this character came from a super hero comic book.
I most definitely enjoyed this film and I am so glad that they did what they did. Never was there ever a DC film that delve so deep into a film where it became a psychological film that shows you the personal life of someone like this (not even Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy takes this approach).
Very good. Modern Day Cinema."
3660,"This movie took me away from 'comic book movies' structure, I did already like the heath ledger's Joker beforehand. But this was a good reflection of a person getting more and more insane because he is 'dismissed,' by everyone. Hey at least I now know Who killed Bruce Wayne's parents, Someone sometime said:""You dont have to pull the trigger to kill a person."""
3661,"This movie was amazing. To be honest I'm to lazy to write a full review, I just wanted to rate it with 10 stars, so I'm writing this nonsense because the site told me my review was too short. On another note there's a huge chance no one will ever read this so I'm most likely wasting my time in vain."
3662,"This is a really great movie even if you don´t like superheroes movies, if no one tell you that is a movie for the joker you will never know. The performance of Joaquin Phoenix absolutely perfect, the laugh that he trained for over a month is outstanding. For me this is a drama movie, a good one."
3663,"Hard to understand the empathy, or sympathy, played to the audience. But Mr. Phoniex's performance was wonderful."
3664,"I remember how upset this movie made the wokerati on Twitter claiming it was going to create incel shooters. I'm so glad people ignored them and made it the success they could only wish Ghostbusters and any other woke garbage they've tried to push on to the public. I'm a huge fan of the character and while its not exactly faithful to any version of the character we've seen so far Joaquin Phoenix performance captures the spirit of who the joker is and is easily on par with Ledger. All you need is one bad day and its scarily realised in this movie, while never making Arthur a hero you may even empathise with him, he is always portrayed as pathetic and his actions are never glamorized where you want to be him unlike Ledger whose charisma made him too likeable and no matter how evil he was. I cant praise it enough. 10 out of 10."
3665,"Led by Joaquin Phoenix's ferocious and swashbuckling performance, this dark movie explores the Origins of the most famous character of the Batman series after Batman himself. ""Joker"" is a movie that's drawn more toward real-world troubles than to capes and crusading. The dark essence of the movie is very well spread out in such a way that it makes it difficult for the viewer to understand weather joker is an protagonist or an antagonist of the movie.With Joker, director Todd Phillips sets aside his penchant for juvenile comedies like The Hangover and channels to explore the dark side of humanity and the origins of joker. The film rages at the human condition and the darkness that might break a person and turn that person into a monster. Specifically, the director points fingers at the wealthy and powerful, who claim to want to help but make it impossible for the downtrodden to pick themselves up.Phenomenal screenplay adds tremendous value to the acting capabilities of Joaquin Phoenix as the joker who embodies the utter despair of this situation, digging deep with a full-bodied performance, forever struggling to find hope but faltering at every attempt he makes. Skeletal and dark-spirited, he moves his limbs like a spider, either twining as if spinning a web or flailing and flapping like a manic cartoon character. But Batman's famous nemesis isn't just villainous any longer; he's a heartbreaking mistake that could have been prevented. It's no coincidence that Joker is set during a garbage strike, given that humans here are thrown to the curb just as easily as black plastic bags.In this very bleak movie, the bright colors of the Joker's clown makeup offer a violent, horrifying escape. It helps that excellent cinematography adds an extended dimension to the storytelling. Editing, make up and production design for the 80s feel is just outstanding. Music explores and almost teases us to dance to the mind of the joker. Robert de Niro's acting in a supporting role, though remnants of his 1982 black comedy ""King of comedy"" is simply outstanding.Joker in my opinion is the best movie of 2019 and will be remembered for a long, long time singlehandedly for Joaquin Phoenix's performance. A must watch movie for Batman fans or people who like to see something different."
3666,"Sometimes we, the society, turn people into 'monsters'..."
3667,"I don't usually do reviews as most people disagree with my 'opinion'.... But I have have to make an exception for this film.This film is definitely in my to 10 films and I have seen a lot of films...
Joaquin's performance should have given him an Oscar, the story is amazingly put together and shows a different size of Joker that even though is sad, learns you to love him for what he went through and what he stands for. It makes you ask yourself what is 'normal' in society and whether society as we know it is 'normal'.
Performance wise, this is 'CLASS', acting at its best, perfectly casted don't think anyone else would have been able to pull it off...
It's dark, funny and really pulls you into the story of the star of the Joker. It gives you the opportunity to understand 'why', 'who' and 'why' the character in a theatrical and entertaining way.
Very rarely does a film appear that is more thought provoking and projects a story such as this.Just sit down, watch it and see what I mean. If it does not affect you in anyway then you obviously have not watched it properly!!!It's very rare that a film has social and cultural meaning and goes against the 'norm' like this film does...This is a masterpiece."
3668,"""Is it just me or is it getting crazier out there?"" wails Arther Fleck ( Joker) who wears a mask and is an aspiring stand up comedian who just wants to be loved and accepted by society.
The setting is Gotham city which is presently in a lockdown due civic problems. The people are protesting against the unpopular Mayor who had called them clowns.
This character has already been played out by Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger in previous versions of the film and they have made the character of joker memorable and iconic.
Now director Todd Phillips gives his own interpretation of the character and with the help of actor Joaquin Phoenix, he has made a near masterpiece.
The joker is a loving son to his ailing mother. In a memorable scene he is shown bathing her.
In his vulnerable moments he asks for love and respect from the public. He is looking for a father figure since his mother has told that his father had abandoned them earlier. She had hinted that the mayor is his father. He speaks to the mayor only to be rejected downright.
He lands in a job of looking after children but his posession of a gun causes him trouble with the administration. The joker has a serious problem in that he suddenly breaks out into involuntary uncontrollable laughter ( a kind of Tourette's syndrome) at any place and he can't stop. This gets him frequently into trouble. For this he carries a card explaining this physical condition to the shocked people.
On various occasions the joker has been called a psychopath ,sadist , murdering maniac, crown prince of crime etc . He gives vent to his frustration by indulging in violence. The film has quite some footage of graphic mind numbing killings at periodic intervals.
Joaquin deserves a standing ovation for a superlative performance. He carries the entire film on his shoulders. Robert De Nero has been wasted in a insignificant small role.
The film has got two much deserved Oscars for actor Joaquin and music both being the highlights of the film. The film is first rate and falls in the must watch category."
3669,"It was a good movie .
This film showed us that people react defferently in different situations and a smile is not just sign of happiness .
Sometimes a depressed person has a different smile .
All people live with a mask on their face ."
3670,"Not like the other Jokers. Not even the same genre. Instead of a character out of a comic book, this movie portrays him as a regular man who due to societal abandonment slowly descends into madness.Joaquin Phoenix did a phenomenal job of fleshing this character."
3671,Best movie I've watched in years. Joaquin Phoenix killed it. Stop researching & just watch it. You won't regret it.
3672,"People who didn't like Joker are people who don't like superhero movies which this one isn't at all - people who don't like truth or close their eyes in other people's misery - people who don't like celebration at any kind besides their own. It is a weird world we live in, embrace it."
3673,"If you've ever experienced mental or physical illness, failed creative ambition, and/or financial hardship,I suspect you can find a thread of empathy for Arthur.
This film is a beautiful, terrible indictment of our sinking civilization, where stress and isolation grind us down.
If you can't see why this movie gets so many raves, or worse, are bored by it, you must be missing the empathy gene. a condition that makes our world a tough place to live in."
3674,This movie is great. I loved watching it every second. This move is definitely a must see.
3675,"A different way of representation of this iconic character the Joker.A role that Actors like the one and only Jack Nicholson, the important Heath Leadger and many others have performed with success.But yet in this performace there was something different, something unique.I guess we could never imagine a ""humanish""version of Joker...But this legend (Joaquin Phoenix)made it real.He actually made us understand the character of this loving villain by making it clear that isn't just a superhero but is a person who leaves among us and he has to handle with rejection,disappointment and the evilness of this world just because he is different.He tries to make himself be noticed by harming people who ""destroyed"" his life or harmed him first.Despite of all that you're just trying to find ways to justify his actions because deep down you can understand him. This talented and one of the best actors of our generation managed to show something different that gave us the chills..."
3676,"""Am I thinking too much, or is the world getting too crazy?"" This sentence, from a social bottom marginal people to speak their feelings of survival? Or is it biased by Arthur's negative thoughts about mental illness?"
3677,I liked Phoenix. That's about it. Maybe because I compared it too much To Dark Knight. And realy it's totally different. It stands on it's own and well...I would only use it as background noise.
3678,"The show was OK, fine, entertaining and interesting, but really lacked a good story. The point of the comics was how does a normal man become the joker. In this version, Arthur is practically already the joker and just needs a little prodding to finally get there. The take on Thomas Wayne was also wrong and a bit insulting."
3679,Joaquin Phoenix amazingly represents the iconic villain and shows how the Joker became the villain we all know as the Joker. The film also symbolizes how society behaves and how the news takes advantage of events.
3680,Enjoyed it.. Acting and the message is awesome! Totally worth watching..
3681,"Joaquin Phoenix cannot save this jumbled, predictable, and tedious film. Watching Phoenix is always mesmerising, and this is no different as he laughs, chokes, stumbles, and contorts himself into an Oscar winning role. However, the film is not entertaining, and seriously suffers from a lack of a supporting cast, whose characters are simply in orbit of the Joker, and therefore never allowed to support the film.This also reveals the film to be an actors exhibition, rather than an actual character study of the ""joker"", since the portrayal is of someone who was already mad, perhaps even congenitally unstable rather than someone who becomes mad because of his a the mdult experiences.Finally I thought the film could have done without any mention of Bruce Wayne or
the frankly overused scenario of his parents murder, but that it did simply underscored to me how bereft of ideas the film was.Joaquin Phoenix is a once in a generation actor, and will continue to amaze us all, but I don't think he has surpassed either Nicholson nor Ledger as far as the Joker is concerned."
3682,"What an amazing film, and Joaquim Phoenix just blewd my mind!!!!"
3683,"Photography, art, acting and music make this film incredible!"
3684,Beautiful movie. joaquin phoenix's Acting was incredible. Beautiful cinematography. Everything Great.
3685,"One of the best, maybe even the best, movies I have seen in the last and in this year so far. A misunderstood movie if you read the reviews on the news. Is it brutal? Yes. Is it shocking? Yes. Does it cheer people up to become violent? No. This movie asks the audience to look behind the obvious. It asks us to reflect ourselves, as the person we are on our own and the society we builded up. As an empath I was deeply touched and hurt by the suffering of Arthur Fleck, the main character. His development is relatable and performed brilliantly by a Joaquin Phoenix in best form. JP is transforming in both characters, Arthur and then becoming more and more the Joker, so very commiting that it will take your breath. The score underlines perfectly the feelings of the main character and if you open up, this movie will get under your skin. It is an emotional ride with social criticism at it's realest."
3686,"Joker is a purposefully strange movie, with full intention to make the viewers potentially uncomfortable. It is one of those movies that makes you squirm with discomfort, not out of disgust or fear, but out of sympathy for the situation. The Joker is portrayed as a mentally ill man with a sad past and an equally sad present. His origin story is more bleak as the story continues and it truly makes you sympathize with him for what he goes through. His walk of life is constantly confused and misconstrued. For that, the movies ability to make you sympathize with someone who we know will eventually be a pure root of evil makes it a great watch. In general, the movie pulls of this idea phenomenally and for that I consider it a great movie to view."
3687,"I like the Joker movie, but I was quite surprised with the story and not as expected. My friends told me it was very good, but with high expectations, I didn't feel that entertained during the movie.So even though Joaquin Phoenix deserves credit for his performance, I can't give it more than 6 stars."
3688,"After watching this movie, I was amazed. I found myself thinking, ""how does a movie like this exist?"" A very interesting look into the mind of a deranged individual and the role society has played in making him that way. However, having lingered on this film, I can't help but notice the now-obvious details replicated from Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver."" From minor things like the finger gun blast to the head to the entire political election plot, I believe these are too frequent and direct to just be references. There are many more that I have not listed but those that have viewed both films should start making connections if they haven't already. I cannot put into words how disappointed I am that this otherwise brilliant film is, for the most part, an imitation of a classic.I give this film 5/10, just for Joaquin's excellent performance. His acting alone almost makes up for the replicated details."
3689,I like it so much .. Thanks Todd for amazing directing
3690,"I went to see this movie without expecting to like it as comics like DC or Marvel (superhero stories) are not of my taste. This movie was not at all a super hero type of DC movie. It was very much realistic and did a great job at making us feel the emotions of the Joker. Great job from Joaquin Phoenix who perfectly played the character. The laugh and the body movements were done amazingly. The plot was great, the scenes were great, the background music was great. I give it a 10."
3691,"A frustrated but relatively harmless guy gets pushed over a little too much and goes on a sick rampage. This is a story I've seen several times, the first one I remember being Falling Down, that 1993 movie with Michael Douglas. There were definitely some more, I just can't recall them, because the plot of such films always goes through the same steps, you just can't tell the stories apart.I've heard so much praise for Joker, I expected something groundbreaking. Instead what we have here is one stellar individual performance in front of an otherwise dull and intentionally grisly landscape. An unsettled city full of unsolved social issues, cynical politicians saying things as if to fire up the situation on purpose. Violent kids on the street, white-collar jerks, everything around created specifically to depress the viewer.Sometimes it does feel as if DC simply doesn't want its fans to have a single bright thought or a light emotion. It's a universe full of sad and uptight characters delivering to an army of equally sad people. At least before it was about one emotionally scarred individual putting on a mask and putting on a tour de force against the ""bad guys"". It was dark, but the action tried to make up for it. This time, however, there's almost no action - and you are just taken on a journey of the main character to join him in wallowing in all his personal darkness and drama.Joaquin Phoenix is no doubt exceptional here, his performance is worth all the accolade it received. Besides that, though, Joker is simply too one-dimensional to be touching. When you paint everything black too many times, all the next layers of paint just don't make any difference, and even a clown's garish garb can't bring in enough color to make up for it. Joker is a beautifully messed up character, but he's nowhere close to Tonya Harding, another fantastic performance that was not given half the credit it deserves. Joker's craziness is predefined by his grotesquely gloomy surroundings, while Tonya's fate was a real life story of this very world. Makes one guess whether we can really sympathize with issues we classify as our own.Despite a truly fiery (in all senses) ending, Joker the movie fails to ignite a spark of prolonged interest. If not for the crazy praise this film has received, one might not even feel pressed to share their thoughts on this film with others, turning the watch into a cinematographic one-night stand. Tomorrow, I will probably not be ashamed of what I did tonight. But is this experience simply forgettable without a hint of a lasting trace? Totally so. If people will be thinking about 2019, Baby Yoda is what they'll probably recall first, and that speaks volumes about this film's quality."
3692,"Movie that relates to the person who is disregarded by the society and make fun of them. Inside they filled so much poison for the society that burst out one day and make a character like joker . That is bad for the society , for the living and for himself as well. A well acted , well directed story writing that gives you goosebumps at every time."
3693,"That's an amazing movie ! I watched it in the cinema with my friend and we love it ! good actors, good action and great scenes !"
3694,"DC gave director Todd Phillips a lot of creative space to shoot, and with the wonderful performance of Joaquin Phoenix, ""Joker"" has the art and commercial value of the film.We may sympathize with Arthur 's injustice and malicious bullying in the movie, but if there is someone like Arthur who laughs in front of us today, we can really understand the real emotions and emotions behind his laughter Idea?"
3695,The whole storyline is flowing smoothly. and the whole idea of the story is rly good. yet the joker's laugh. ugh it gives me chill. its overall great anyway.
3696,I really like this. This is the great story. I watched this types of movies in too less quantity because no anyone created this type of movies. Love it :)
3697,"Awesome! You can really feel it.
Finally a movie with reality to support it and help the audience dive in full force. Real action that you can FEEL and imagine being real, instead of crazy jumping around cameras and action that is so unbelievable that it's boring and like a cartoon. So many emotions and moments that were savored. Mmmmm..."
3698,"This movie is exactly the way I think everyhing that is related to Batman is and must be represented.
""The Batman world"" is a sad, dark, scary world.
Well, maybe this one came too close to our reality..."
3699,The Joker has always been one of my favourite comic book characters and his portrayal in this film buy Joaquin phoenix was quite literally fantastic I was hooked on this film from the very beginning takes you through a whirlwind of emotions really enjoyed it absolute must watch great origin film not the best joker not the worst joker just another joker fantastic
3700,"An origins story you never knew you needed. An incredible performance Joaquin Phoenix holds it all together. If you have watched batman films you will know the basic plot. This film ties it up all beautifully and explores alot of themes. It becomes almost uncomftabley relatable at points. The film doesn't really go anywhere it just shows us a character. There are no big susprises but a few twist and turns. If your like me you will know where it going almost from the start. Plently of violence is thrown in but not as much as you might expect. There is plently going on here behind the gore, violence and chaos."
3701,"Joaquin Phoenix as Joker and Todd Phillips as its writer director and producer was not that much convincing for me at first when it was announced. No questions to the Phoenix as an actor but it's the role of Joker bloody Joker which was not a Joke and Todd Phillips the director of Hangover franchise also raised questions as DC is dark and could he pull that off?
Despite of all reservations I would give it to WB's that all the hype they created after the first trailer but still it's about Joker and honestly everyone had their reservations despite of all the hype and a good trailer.
The moment I saw the first scene of the movie where phoenix is doing his makeup of Joker with deliberately making that iconic extended smile with his bare hands on his face, A closeup face shot where suddenly tears started to fall, it took me somewhere else and yes it was just the first scene.
The story shows the late 70's condition of Gotham city where there was economic unrest, income disparity nothing but anger and depression among the general people against the High-class rich people.
The story roams around the Arthur Fleck aka Joker a mentally depressed having pre medical condition and somehow being bullied by everyone he met. The story gets darker and darker as Fleck experiences new traumas each and every day making him nothing but a bizarre cold-blooded maniac we know as ""Joker"" in the end.
Film's direction, tight screenplay, background score and cinematography everything was touching the right notes and was so perfect that it would indulge you so into it and will take your brain and heart in to another universe which is Dark literally Dark.
Despite of everything being perfect i.e. direction, screenplay, background score, cinematography etc. the movie still belongs to Phoenix, he has over shadowed every single aspect of the movie through his effortless and convincing acting. 2 hours 2 mins movie has Phoenix in almost each and every frame and my GOD what he has done is absolutely phenomenal, he has portrayed Arthur Fleck so effortlessly that at some point I started empathizing with the character, the innocence, the simplicity the facial expressions, the physique all will make you connect and fall in love with Arthur.
Phoenix has outclassed each and everything with perfection whether it's bizarre and nervous Laugh, the unique dancing which he is fond of, the diary where he writes whatever he feels and carries with him everywhere he goes. Scenes with the legend Robert De Niro are my personal favorites, first scene where Arthur imagined himself in the late-night show where he interacts with his icon Murray Franklin played by De Niro and the dialogues between them with Arthur being completely honest and innocent was nothing but love and the scene just before climax where Arthur has done taking it and has evolved as The ""JOKER"" actually went to the Murray Franklin's show and confess everything, heated dialogues between Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) and Joker (Joaquin Phoenix) will get into your nerves."
3702,"I found this movie extremely interesting. Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix seemed to be so on point with how they wanted every scene in the movie to pan out. I really loved this movie start to finish. Every scene seemed carefully crafted with symbolism. It was simple yet complex. It was a movie that made you want to root for the bad guy.The only thing I find unfortunate, is that this seems like as good as it's going to get. WB is not going to give Todd Phillips the freedom to continue what he did here again now that it has made so much money. Even if they did, would the magic of this film be recaptured? I want to see more but at the same time I don't think you will get anything better than what was made from this movie. Keep it pure and leave it as a one off movie."
3703,"This is a kind of movie that requires you to sit down and rethink about it. The movie is dark and affective. Despite the fact that lots of people think that this movie is a blockbuster movie just like the other comic book based movies this film isn't a blockbuster. This film is a piece of art.Actually the story is nothing too extraordinary. What makes this movie really good is the way the story is told. The story is basically telling how the society drives a man mad. We have seen similar stories before but the way that it is told in the film is what makes it different and better.The cinematography in the movie is beautiful. There are some amazing shots. Especially the scenes with Arthur Fleck dancing. Also about the dance scenes, they are probably the most affective scenes in the entire movie because you can see that every single move that he does while dancing is a portrayal of his emotions inside. Also I want to mention the outstanding music in the film.Everyone can agree that Joaquin Phoenix was awesome in the role. Actually there is not much to say about his performance because it was perfect.I think this film is a real masterpiece and my favourite movie of 2019."
3704,"This movie is very practical: This is the era of super villains, populism has spread to the world, the definition of justice and evil is misplaced, Trump and the other people are also like the clowns, who are on the top of the hall and are openly sentenced to public opinions. However, Joker is different from them in that he has experienced the worst life, like a joke that can't be laughed at, accompanied by his unbridled dance and laughter in the most miserable world. The performance of Jacques Phoenix is amazing."
3705,"I don't understand how anyone can diss this film! They are obviously just jealous and can't just simply applaud someone for playing a great role! The film shouldn't be taken into context with the original joker character as it's a stand alone and you have to be open minded when watching it to take in the storyline. Joaquin Phoenix plays this role absolutely amazingly, you believe his pain and upset throughout."
3706,"This different ""clown"" story is why a poor man, Arthur, became an antisocial villain, and then became a known crime prince in Gotham. DC opened a lot of space for director Todd Phillips to play, and with the wonderful performance of Wakun Phoenix, the movie ""Clown"" has the presentation of film art and commercial value."
3707,"Mentally disturbed clown who wants to be a comedian. How he imagines things like it is happening to him in real-life and this really disturbs him, along with the disrespect he gets from the people around him, and brings him in with his alter-ego and our beloved character, Joker 🃏
P.S. Joaquin is brilliant in this."
3708,Every single person who I know who have watched this movie had given it a 10. This movie shows the dark side of Gotham city and the origins of DC's most amazing villain. At the end it makes you feel sorry for a person who turned into a psychopath due to his conditions.A truly AMAZING FILM
3709,"Phoenix is brilliant. He ties the whole movie together wonderfully. A lost soul in a self-obsessed world that chews up and spits his ilk out for their own amusement. The world is full of 'Jokers' waiting to happen. This is the Taxi Driver and King of Comedy of modern times. Yet we never seem to learn the lesson. Disturbing, graphic, real...a great film."
3710,Joaquin Phoenix did a great job as the joker And 12 time awards
3711,"What a great movie! I was very impressed with this whole movie beginning to end. Going into it I had heard mixed reviews, some that loved it and others that thought it was too dark. But I thought it was perfectly balanced throughout.I had been wondering recently about how some people like the Joker, are created. Is it a state of mind that is with them from birth, that's just who they are, or is it more to do with their environment, in those who shape and hurt them. Joker, does such a good job of showing how significant the environment around someone can bring out the villain in them. He loses everything, all of his significant loved ones, friends and heroes that layer by layer the Joker is pushed closer into existance. This makes for such a believable villain compared to cliche bad guys who just want to kill everyone and hurt people because they want lots of money or power. This type of story is boring and unrelatable. It doesn't force me to think about how to treat others, it just teaches me to look out for the odd person out there who is really bad.The joker however is such a compelling story that it forces you to consider how you treat every single person and whether your actions are bringing out the joker in someone else. The bullying from all those around the Joker and the way others mock and ridicule him, show us that they are actually the true villains.This movie makes sense, its smart and well thought out. I really struggle to come up with any plot holes of that let it down. This is such a nice relief and joy when compared to the sloppy movie making of many other directors and writers out there. Every one of the Joker's decisions is understandable, it makes sense why he shoots his attackers, or why he chooses to kill his hero instead of himself. The movie builds itself in logical steps so that when these things happen, its shocking, but it still makes sense. You can see why his character would choose to do this. Whereas many other villains often make terrible choices, ones that are unrelatable and do not make sense with his character.Joaquin Phoenix was a masterclass and put in such a great performance. It felt like he was literally in every scene. It looks also like he put his body through a huge strain to get it to a place where he is quite bony and looking unwell. He was so authentic and bold as well, in his dancing, laughing and even the spit running down his nose in one scene, he really commits everything for this role, regardless of what others will think. The supporting actors really help to drive the plot, but they are so secondary that it actually works well to contribute to pushing the focus back towards the Joker. His character development is the ultimate win of this whole movie, who he becomes from who he starts out as is completely different. He changes in almost everyway. He loses himself and becomes a new person, he becomes the Joker.Overall this movie is epic. It makes you think, its smart and shocking and definitely in my top list of favourite movies. In my opinion its not too dark, I think the Joker in the Dark Knight was darker and creepier. This joker is relatable and conjures up a lot of empathy. I hope this movie can teach us all to make sure we treat all those in society with the love that they all deserve."
3712,A masterpiece by Todd Phillips. Best movie of 2019. The acting by Joaquin Phoenix was mind blowing. The soundscore and background was my personal favourite. And the most surprising things about this movie was it's ending. The way they show the connection to batman was just amazing and full of suprise. A must was to all the movie lover.
3713,The acting of Joaquin phoenix is absolutely mind-blowing in this movie you should watch it. It is obviously a Oscar winning role and acting.
3714,"The amazing thing about The Joker is as usual you will get the typical movment and the way the joker acts , but this time it will make sense to you because they take you to his process of thoughts, the more i see a key moments from the movie the more im convinced with it .
I think Joaquin did an extraordinary job representing him, I dont think i've ever been more convenient by an act like the one he pulled off , i totally forgot he was acting and believed everything he did.
This is truly the essence of DC comics , and they should exploit that from now on ."
3715,"There are many good movies, a lot of great movies but there are only few movies that leave a mark on your conscience and make you think twice & give you lessons about what is life and how to live it. Joker is a movie that touches your heart in every way possible. It's the story of the world's most notorius & popular villan's life before he became a villain. What made him become a criminal and what pushed him to spread anarchy all over Gotham City.
It's a movie about how people change because of the people around them & how a man becomes a criminal because of the society in a light that we never saw before.
It's the most artistic movie because of it's character potrayals, all over music score, the screenplay, the directon & the cinematography.
Joaquin Phoenix also did an excellent job in helping the Joker to come back to life. There were no flaws in his acting & he did justice to the character & that is the hardest job to do.
I watched this movie twice & got teary eyed at the last moment because Joker has put the benchmark really high of what an artistic movie should be."
3716,"Joker
He looks so happy
He opened his mouth
Want to look happy
But under the false smiley
Is a sad tear
When you succeed, some people focus on your success, but others deny your success.
I always think that the reason why you succeed is because you have a backer, and you use crouching methods to make yourself climb up.
They haven't seen your efforts, and even the bitterness you have suffered, they have no sympathy.
If you think this is just a dark, oppressive, and destiny-resistant film, then you still haven't seen what it really wants to express"
3717,"You can like the movie or not but Phoenix makes de BEST interpretation of the decide, at least of the year."
3718,"Considering that previous joker films have been great to excellent, this movie had big shoes to fill. There's a certain level of anxiety and awkwardness with this movie, which is what is needed. You can see Phoenix's character almost hitting his breaking point in multiple occasions and when he finally does, it is enthralling"
3719,Loved the message of the Joker film... where you clearly see and understand that our societies need to do more to support its poor and those in need of psychological and medical care.. its our job after all.. all of us
3720,"It's a really beautiful movie, the cinematography is beautiful, i find the story very relatable. It's an all round amazing movie"
3721,What a great performance from Joaquin. Wasn't sure if I was going to watch this but I am sure glad I did. Great music through out the movie. Showed us where the Joker came from mental illness. Reminded me of the Heath Ledger Joker dark. Loved his performance on the Murray Franklin show. I now see how he won the Oscar deserving.
3722,"Brilliant film, in some aspects it's even better than its inspirations.P.S. To all people who constantly and annoyingly complain about Joker borrowing from old movies: you are giant hypocrites and terrible people. All movies borrow from other movies and works of art, you complain about that only if you didn't like the movie. Take a look at your favourite movies and tell me again this bs about originality. The Matrix ripped off a lot of stuff from the famous sci-fi books and manga. La La Land ripped off old musicals. Terminator and Aliens borrowed a lot from Robert A. Heinlein books. Reserviour Dogs literally ripped off City on Fire and The Killing, literally the same scenes in the same context. The Revenant copied shots and scenes from Tarkovsky movies. There's no original shot in Kill Bill. And I can go on and on. So stop with this bs about ripoff and originality and just say that you didn't like the movie if you didn't like it for the reasons that have to with the movie itself."
3723,"Life is a tragedy when seen in close-up, but a comedy in long-shot.-- Charlie Chaplin"
3724,"Amazing, Stunning best hollywood movie of all times."
3725,Phoenix deserves an Oscar and the performance is so emotional.
3726,Depressing and disturbing and I couldn't stop watching. Amazing proformace by Joaquin Phoenix.
3727,"This film showed the perspective of a person that society has yet to understand. Not the Joker himself, per say, but a traumatized person who can't get help. I have the deepest, impossible to state, respect for the portrayal of this man, who really represents all of us on some level. We just didn't know it before. Take the make up off, take the pretty lights, and Joaquin and the director have given us the gift of humanity. God bless them for this."
3728,Amazing filmography. Amazing acting. Real subject. Beautifully done.
3729,VEry deep and emotional with great acting! It really sheds a lght on depression and the darkness of mental illness
3730,"This review contains spoilers.Joker is a psychological thriller movie that premiered in 2019. The movie is based on the DC comics character Joker. The movie is directed by Todd Phillips, and written by Todd Phillips, and Scott Silver. The movie stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck a down on his luck party clown.Joker is an interesting origin story for the titular character. The movie is a slow look at the insanity that Arthur Fleck descends into. He battles his psychological problems and discovers facts about his mother that disturb him. The movie focuses the 122 minutes of running time on Arthur Fleck as the audience sees his mental state deteriorating. The movie has an incredibly dark tone that should be commended. The movie explored the use of a villain as the main character and the setting of Gotham being a rundown urban city was the opposite of how Gotham is portrayed in other media. The city is much more threatening than how the city looked from Bruce Wayne's perspective.Joker does not shy away from the unpleasant aspects of mental illness and destitution. The movie portrays the helplessness that is felt by someone like Arthur Fleck with accuracy. This character comes to identify the lower classes both in Gotham and in urban centers around the world. The idea of a character that does not stand for anything becoming a symbol is believable in this movie.The movie is open to interpretation. As the first act of the movie ends, Arthur's medication is cut due to lack of funding at the mental center that he checks in at. The first act of the movie reflects reality but then later Arthur begins having delusions. These delusions plague on the audience interprets the movie as they only see the movie through Arthur's eyes. There is no other perspective in this movie. The other characters do react realistically but they react only to Arthur Fleck. The later portions of the movie become less believable as Arthur is executing seemingly impossible plans. The movie does try to ground the audience with real events by showing them through the television. This was an interesting approach but the movie becomes similar to other movies that this movie is a fan of. One of these movies is The King of Comedy (1982) where the entire ending finale is pulled from The King of Comedy. Much of Arthur Fleck's goals are similar to the goals found in The King of Comedy that it makes the movie feel less original.Despite some of the problems in Joker's originality, Joaquin Phoenix's performance makes this movie. He is a perfect Joker and the actor masterfully reflects the descent into insanity that characterizes the Joker. I would recommend Joker.Grade: B"
3731,"Plot holes aside (If the entire Gotham is so vicious, who is Batman gonna save it for... the filthy rich? He's SUPPOSED to be a hero for goodness sake), the film paints a masterful portrait of a back story. Now they just have to find a super villain whose life it fits."
3732,"Aside from the storytelling of how the Joker came to be, this film beautifully captured the true essence of what it means to be living with a mental illness in a society that struggles to accept and understand it. The inaccuracies and exaggerations that come with the portrayal of mental illness in movies are all things we are prone to see and unfortunately fuel the stigma surrounding mental illness. It's refreshing to see a movie that tackles that stigma at its core by showing problems with society itself and how society treats individuals struggling with mental illness. It's very possible to merge entertainment with education and this movie exceeded that. While addressing issues like societal judgement and unhelpful medical staff, we were able to see it conveyed in a way that was also interesting and entertaining to see. The aspect that resonated with me the most was when Arthur called his therapist out for not listening and asking the same questions every week. Another aspect I found particularly interesting was how even though Arthur made efforts to get help and treatment, he wasn't given help when his therapist informed him that funding cuts were being made and he wouldn't be able to continue seeing her. Keeping the momentum of going to treatments and trying to get better is a long struggle that takes a lot of effort and work. Not being given the proper resources or support to keep that treatment can also be extremely detrimental and many are unfortunately put in this position. There are many individuals struggling with mental illness that do not have the resources to get help. I'm glad this point was reinforced in this film because there are individuals that want and seek help but simply do not have the resources to continue or find it. What made this movie unique was its ability to speak to a large audience, not only those struggling with mental illness but also those seeking to understand those that do. One of the ways Joaquin Phoenix prepared for his role was he studied up on how to portray Arthur's mental health struggles in the most accurate ways possible. One of the best ways we can tackle the stigma is to show more accurate portrayals and working alongside mental health professionals or psychologists so actors can portray those characters in the most accurate ways possible. While there are no justifications for Arthur's crimes, we did see how lack of empathy and support influenced the way he saw the world. The world can be a very cruel place, but the most important thing we can do is extend a helping hand to a stranger to spread a little joy in the world."
3733,"Great movie,amazing job done by the director and the actor.It is crazy how Joaquin was able to pull this role,his performance in the movie was brilliant.This movie is able to portray how depression and loneliness can turn someone into a criminal."
3734,"Well, didn't read anything of the film before watching it. I was prepared to see another take on the Jokers insanity, but it took a slightly darker path than anticipated.
Finding and portraying the dark mind of a person that is both mistreated and led astray in a series of mishaps and unplanned incidents is absolutely mind boggling.I could not quite let the small imperfections in the script go, how the joker was an unknown in the Dark Knight and here he is the known instigator of a 'clown' riot through the street of Gotham.This is among the more terrifying movies I've seen from a perspective of 'mind exploration' that devides it up upon both actions from the Joker and the experiences he has that forms him.
I was divided between 8 or 9, since it is so good on the portrait of insanity that I think I'll never want to see it again. On the other hand the small script details annoys me, even though it should stand alone from the previous movies.Highly recommended watch!"
3735,The movie itself was kinda nice but didn't pull me into it. The performance by Joaquin is the real deal here. I wouldn't have been surprised if this movie hadn't made it to the finals for Academy Awards.
3736,"Thing is I at first was continuously confused by this movie because I thought it was riddled with plotholes, but when I looked back and took into consideration that it may not all be real, I actually saw this as pretty good! Plus Joaquin Pheonix was so confident in his role!"
3737,"Seeing the trailer intrigued me. Someone who hasn't seen all of the batman films, but certainly knows the story, I still really wanted to see this film.I wasn't sure what to expect, but I knew instantly they chose the right actor for the job.A dark take on a very dark character, I loved it and although I wanted more from this film, I believe it was the perfect blend of madness and what took him there. Artistic in its own right, I certainly appreciated the provocative nature of this film. I felt the character that is, Joker, was oddly likable and left me wanting to watch more after this film ended.Many people will be left with with mixed feelings about this film and many will not like it at all, but on face value, I thought it was good, not great, but good."
3738,Joker is a really well made movie about the mind set of a troubled character.
3739,"Dancing scene was good.
but i think that dancing scene was inspired from bong joon-ho's mohter opening and ending scene."
3740,"It seems like a prologue for definetily one or two more movies. Somehow the whole setup reminds me of Requiem for a Dream, I would have wished for more action tho'"
3741,"First off, I absolutely think this was a cinematic masterpiece. And ties together the Batman universe with its deadliest foe. But the backstory on Joker was so relevant to the storyline. An ENTIRE movie where you question what he's seeing is real or in his head was almost impossible to pull off.. Fantastic... I wasn't sure if I was going to like it.. then I loved it. Phoenix .. you deserved the Oscar.. very few could have pulled that performance off with such detail."
3742,"Really hits home the effects of mental health and bullying.
Beautifully made film, double Oscar winner and very well deserved best actor for phoenix."
3743,"A well-made film by Todd Philips and Co. with a commanding and tragic performance by Joaquin Phoenix. The film gives us easy commentary on aspects of reality through the differences of social classes and the grasp on understanding mental illnesses. The main character, Joker, is the catalyst for the story and to tie it all together we get a very original take on the beginning of the comic-world's most notorious villain.IMO, Joaquin's best performance will always be Freddie Quell in The Master, but this is very good. It appears he may be on his way to getting his first Oscar."
3744,"A credit to the writers and to Joachim (always been a favorite actor) for telling a story of a tortured soul who has struggled with being abandoned all his life, a mental illness from a head injury as an abused child, ridiculed for his illness- he just cannot get a break. Its heartbreaking.
From here, the story sets up for 'the joker' as he becomes a dangerous murderer, but although the character says he has no political agenda, an anarchist mob wants him to have one. That agenda is simplistic and stupid - an attack on the rich- something never explained in modern times (rather hard to do in a nation of equal opportunity and social supports for those who need it). That's the Marvel comic part of it.Its the clever study of mental suffering that is the heart of the story. Joachim nailed it."
3745,In my opinion this mvoie should beat Dark Knight just because this movie feel more realistic and a beautiful master peice. I like how joker origin is not a silly origin where he fell down in toxic waste if funny to see fan piss about how it doesnt follow comic and break the rules. I like how the movie beats dark knight in box office. The cinematography of the scene is amazing.
3746,"Playing Joker was a masterful job my Phoenix. A gutsy project for all involved. Although the complexity of character was the main draw, I loved the sets, cinematography and even the soundtrack. The tension was cut with a naughty, playful mix of a madman's smile and style. Phoenix disappeared into his character as he has done in so many excellent past performances. It fits well with the Batman story, it's a strong scary companion of the Dark Knight and has a lot of uncomfortable reality.Long sentence ramble warning: The mix of DC comic fantasy storytelling and setting with serious modern day concerns about mental health and accessibility of guns could have tipped a viewer to safer ground, but there was a level of believability of Joker's world that left no doubt we were beyond comic book fantasy and forced to face the real dangers of today's unfair and uncaring world."
3747,"Joker is one of those good rare movies that you won't find easily these days. The acting was incredible, the story, the cinematography, the score, everything was perfect. It was dark, yet so beautiful. Among many other boring superhero movies with overused CGI, SJW agendas, and cringe jokes, finally, Joker was exactly the movie we needed and we deserved today."
3748,"It's a good movie. Ok, yes it is. But my question is: is isn't it an overrated movie?
What if the main character wold be not be the Joker but a regular clown instead? Yes. Would be a good movie, period. But not this movie with this big fame. It's just an opinion but for me the mystique of Batman makes this movie overrated."
3749,"Maligned, manic, masked, wounded, Oedipal, lonely, fragile. An Oscar-bound performance from an actor whose career has been rising Phoenix-esque since 2010's disastrous mocumentary ""I'm Still Here"".Director Todd Phillips gifts Joaquin with the role of a lifetime in this character study set in a post-populist Gotham, riddled with crime and trash, tracing the spiral from awkward loner to Killer Clown. The casting of De Niro as talk show host (and surrogate father) is heavily weighted by his roles in ""The King of Comedy"" and ""Taxi Driver"" both of which resonate with the themes of ""Joker"".The now-iconic Bronx staircase, appropriately located on Shakespeare Avenue, is a perfect setting for our anti-hero's descent into villaindom. But with his backstory exposed do we condemn him or cheer him on? Thus the filmmakers present a fitting commentary on our times in this morally ambiguous tale."
3750,"There is nothing else to say. This is THE movie of the decade, haven't seen so much hype for a movie in a long time. What else can I say, Warner you did good even after the horrible DC movies you got up again and proved there is more than just Marvel. This is the movie that will save the lost art of cinema."
3751,"I liked this movie for the reason I believe it was written - to depict the backstory of the comic book villain. And yes, that includes mental instability, fragility, betrayal (i.e. Penny Fleck), and being the opposite of the hero - not Thomas Wayne, but Bruce Wayne. Spoiler** The moment Arthur meets Bruce sent chills down my spine. It was comic book heaven, a pure foreshadowing of events to come. And by the end of the movie as the formula dictates, both Joker and Bruce are alone in the world - the hero and his nemesis.Phoenix came correct, no doubt - but I think he delivered more than just a mentally-ill, socially awkward nobody. He portrayed what real villains are made of, their motivations, and why they are so relentless. Like Mr. Glass (Unbreakable), Doc Oc and the Green Goblin, Maleficent, all villainy begins with societal rejection. Joker did an amazing job of showing the part we never see - how it all began."
3752,The movie show a situación that hapen in my Country Chile. And all the history is very satisfactory and I wait that would be another movie with Joaquín Phoenix but with the big battle with Batman.
3753,"I see reviews from people who have no idea what is going on. I had to explain to the person next to me what the movie was about after we saw it. If you wouldn't consider yourself smart, don't watch this movie. You will most likely not understand it at all."
3754,"I was torn after watching the movie. I want to say it was bad but I don't think that's really fair. I just don't think it works. Kudos to Phoenix and Phillips, etc. for their work on it, but the story is simple, the themes are obvious and I think it suffers from a fatal flaw, which is: dark character studies work when their characters have depth and complexity.The Joker is very flat by design. He's the antithesis of Batman. He represents (in the world in which he was created, at least) pure chaos and anarchy. He is emptiness and lack of meaning. Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy worked. This does not. And I know it sounds like I'm just saying it's a rip off or something, but I'm not. Travis Bickle was multifaceted. The Joker is one note. And after thinking about why the movie didn't click for me I think that's the major difference.Glad I watched it, won't watch again."
3755,"To put it very simply: nice try to reboot Taxi Driver into the 21st century but it never even gets close to the real thing. In Taxi Driver I could feel the alienation, the despair and loneliness of Travis Bickle. Nothing of that here. The only thing that remains is a hollow exercise to do what the great filmmakers like Scorsese did in the seventies.
It's a good evolution, but we need something real, not something borrowed."
3756,"So after reading a bunch of excelent rated reviews I had high expectations. Throughout the movie I was constantly waiting for the point when will I get amazed but all I got was psychological clichés. This character is nothing like the real Joker known from comics, movies or even games. The real Joker has carisma he is sophisticated and intelligent which this movies Joker lacks clearly. Also it felt nothing like a comics movie which I was kinda expecting knowing the fact it's about one of the most known villains of the DC universe. So to sum it all up if you are not familiar with the franchise or haven't watched too many phsychological thrillers you will probably like it otherwise I don't recommend it, it will make you just upset and unsatisfied."
3757,"They inflated it media, but it was very simple compared to what was expected of him"
3758,Yesiree I have been awhile since I have to because I don't have any money in the morning and I will find out the attachment of resume for a suitable position in your company and then I have to have my car.
3759,"Incredible movie. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is sublime. It might have The Joker and be set in Gotham City but there's not a super hero in sight. If you're looking for the latter, best look elsewhere. This is a psychological movie and it will blow your mind. Come to it with no preconceptions 👍🏼"
3760,Loved it deserves an oscar.i loved the craziness and the action
3761,"Wow. Joker is easily the best movie I've seen in a long time. I started watching it on my TV yesterday and was so disturbed by it I turned it off, not sure whether I'd finish watching it. Of course I did, today.What made it so intense for me, besides what makes it so intense for everyone, is that I worked in state mental hospitals for many years and personally knew criminally insane people. Also, I lived in Manhattan during the 70's and the mood, background and vibe portrayed in the film was spot on. When I read afterward that it was supposed to be '81, I was surprised because it appeared and felt so much like the 70's. Besides the shabby condition of the city back then, the whole political thread replete with looting and rioting suggested the great blackout of '77 and its aftermath, not to mention that iconic 70's film, Taxi Driver.As for Joaquin Phoenix's performance well, there's nothing original to say here. His portrayal of a psychotic man was phenomenal. In fact, I had a boyfriend in the '70's who looked like Arthur and while he was crazy, he was the picture of sanity compared to Arthur/Joker.Joaquin had a great script to work with. As a would-be screenplay writer myself, I have a great deal of admiration for Todd Phillips and Scott Silver. In particular the pacing of the script was fantastic, especially the way the details of the past were revealed well into the film. I experienced a sense of ah, now I understand, learning that Arthur's compulsive laughing arose from brain damage sustained during a beating from mom's boyfriend, also that he had a very painful and abusive childhood which explained a lot. There was an amazing sense of development and growing intensity of the character and his madness. Yes, it was somewhat predictable that something big and violent would happen at the end, but who cared? Even the ending was perfect, in my opinion.There were two things that I questioned: one was that Arthur did not use drugs or alcohol. That was certainly different, for the times and for a person with his extreme problems. The other was that the actress who plays Sophie I thought might have been too pretty and ""clean"" looking, meaning also not into drinking or drugs; her skin and eyes too clear, her weight just right, neither too thin nor too fat. It was a little difficult to buy that she would have been involved with Arthur and I was relieved when her attitude toward him changed.Joker is an awesome film and I think it will be days before I can stop thinking about it. It deserves every possible award it can get."
3762,"Great X2, it was pretty much a good movie. I recommend it for an and R rated audience."
3763,Story was interesting but nothing new and certainly not Oscar Worthy. Phoenix's performance was though!
3764,"Look, I know I'm swimming against the tide, but I seriously remain extremely disappointed. I couldn't pick a score for the movie.
But I mark aspects of the movie as follows;
Entertainment factor: 0 stars.
Relentless, deep, dark and disturbing theme: 0 stars.
Single redeeming feature: well-played by the entire cast, but Joaquin Phoenix's superb acting surpassed excellence: 11 stars."
3765,"The movie and its message were good, but the acting was stellar and memorable. Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Academy Award for his rendition of Arthur Fleck! Phoenix reminded me of a younger version of Jack Nicholson in The Shining- one if the most iconic movies ever!"
3766,"Is it dark? Yes!! Is it awkward and painful, Yes!! But because of this, it's all the more genuine and believable of a Joker back story.I went into this thinking it may be a train wreck because there were wildly different opinions on both sides but I have to say this performance is really really well done, by the end of the movie it is such a believable backstory."
3767,"Fitting the theme for Gotham, Arthur is a very, very disturbed person. Joaquin was outstanding. Personally I dont like Bob DeNiro so the highlight of movie for me was watching Arthur splatter his brains all over in one of the final scenes"
3768,"I am no Batman fan, so I watched this because it was marketed as a stand-alone film. The performance by Joaquin Phoenix was mesmerizing and haunting, and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie."
3769,Hit me right in the mental disorder... It's amazing
3770,"This movie's tone is dark, chilling, haunting, violent and at times actually funny. I thought overall this movie could have been better, but it's still a good movie. It kind of starts slow, but as it goes on it gets better and the ending is the best part of the movie. Heath Ledger is still my favorite Joker, but Joaquin Phoenix is still great with his own interpretation of Joker. I personally would love to see a sequel that has Joker taking on Batman. Also be aware that this is not your typical supervillain origin story. This is a psychological drama that explains the origin of Joker and focuses more on story and character development than on action and special effects. This movie reminds me a lot of Taxi Driver, which Robert De Niro was also in."
3771,"I'm still unsure about this movie - yes it was good, the acting was superb, but was this Joker really as good as Ledgers? I don't know. Over all I will probably have to watch this again just to give a final verdict, but Yes this Joker version is definitely better than the Suicide Squad version, how that got put in to a movie I'll never know! Still well worth a watch."
3772,"I was a bit unconvinced that yet another joker would be able to even come close to Heath Ledgers performance but this was brilliant! Well done to Joaquin Phoenix! Phenomenal performance! It's dark, but obviously you must go in with that assumption because it's about The Joker. This was probably one of my favorite back stories on a comic book character thus far."
3773,"I would wipe my memory to rewatch this movie for the ""first"" time again.Ya know, I'd endure all the repercussions of dealing with memory altering technology or chemicals for the sake of seeing this movie again for the first time once more.I'd be A-okay with robots coming back from the future telling me I am the chosen one, but I forgotten that factoid, because last time I was told it was after watching Joker, but before wiping my memory for the 16th time to re-experience Joker as if I hadn't before.I'd delete my upstairs hard drive forsaking the destiny of becoming the king of a future civilization where I am the center and the ideal representation of beauty, intelligence, creativity, and stupid puns so that I could once more, for maybe the hundredth time see, hear, feel the movie, Joker, with all 12 senses (remember I am the chosen one) yet again for the first thyme.I will never forget this most wonderfully dark take on Joker for the rest of my...--Memory Deleted--""Ooh. A new movie."""
3774,"Raw, gritty, sad and wild. This was a great film and Joaquin Phoenix is an incredible actor!I understand the obvious comparisons to Taxi Driver, and this film was clearly influenced by that one, but I honestly felt that, despite the similarities, this one still had it own voice."
3775,Amazing atmosphere in the movie! Joaquin Phoenix is gorgeous! Great script and dark soundtrack. The film addresses issues such as social injustice and loneliness. The ending was super. Joaqin deserves an Oscar!
3776,Great movie all around pins and needles as well 👍
3777,Deeply disturbing; stellar performance by Joaquin Phoenix; artistic cinematography; thought provoking and provocative story.
3778,"""Joker"" (2019) written and directed by Todd Phillip and staring Joaquin Phoenix was perhaps one of 2019's most anticipated and marketed films. Because of popular culture having spoken of the film, I felt like I consciously had to reset my expectations of the film.Two things stood out to me, both trademarks of perfection in ""Joker""; the first being Phoenix' performance, who delivered an incredible and visceral performance of one of comic history's most revered criminals. The sheer grit and panic that he conveyed to the screen was nothing short of breathtaking to witness.Second, Phillips' direction was supreme. The directional choices I thought were particularly intelligent; from a great alternate beginning in terms of identifying the audience with Arthur Fleck, to its excellent pacing and storytelling ability.Apart from these two obvious qualities, it was indeed a fine film experience. But overrated? In my opinion, definitely so. Worthy of top 25? 50? 100? Not in my book.Highly recommended, nonetheless."
3779,"I rarely write reviews, usually multiple people have already said many times over what I would have said myself and my voice is through the rating I'll give. But just seeing the few sad individuals giving this a 1 because it made them mad or uncomfortable is frankly, petty and pathetic.
It's a roller coaster ride, it's supposed to make you angry. And uncomfortable, sad, appalled, with a very stark look at what society can do to the mentally ill and then blame those they have actually helped make victims.
If this is a 1 movie to you, stop watching movies...or at least stop being a critic, you suck. You want movies that are truly 1 star, I can point you to them, this wasn't it. Shame on you crybabies, you're screaming out all the reasons why you're nothing but armchair critics.
With almost 9K reviews here, I hardly need to go over the story again other than to say it was wild. And fit in with the Dark Knight series...which is how the story really is. There are No fat guys jumping around in tights, slapping each other here. And Phoenix acted his ass off, seriously. He looked like he just came out of Auschwitz at times, emaciated and crazed. Even women's film guilds are giving that performance awards the whole crew deserves, ffs."
3780,I'll say it again. Mr phoenix deserves a Oscar for this role. What a performer. This is the story of how and why the joker was created. It needed to be told. I am so glad the director choose Joaquin he is probably one of the most underrated actors out there. This movie was awesome.
3781,"There are many differences between the jokers over the years. Nicholson portrayed the joker that Caesar Romero portrayed in the original Batman series, which was also the mainstream comic book version. A flamboyant theatrical Joker who could make you laugh and kill you at the same time. But also supernatural in a sense. Nicholson was brilliant , Ledger took Nicholson's joker to the dark and sinister maniacal level. Actors nowadays seldom portray a character without it being stereotypical scripted. I mean, Deniro, Joe Pesci, and Pacino play monsters so well.... why? Because they look and fit the stereotype of a monster. It's their forte.Phoenix's Joker is so relatable to audiences because he is a regular guy. Who has suffered, who has struggled, and who gets pushed beyond his limits in a society similar to our own society. So many people struggle with acceptance and just want to be who they are without being judged or told they have to look, feel, and act a certain way. Phoenix marvel's in this role because he became the character, physically and mentally. I think of Charlize Theron in Monster, Matthew McCaughnehey in Dallas Buyers Club, Ledger in The Dark Knight. All of these examples of an actor immersing themselves in the theater and the mindset of the character. I think now you can add Phoenix to that list.This movie is fantastic and enjoyable. You feel every feeling Arthur feels. Its gloriously written, directed, acted, and well everything else falls into place."
3782,"I'm glad to see an 'R' rated movie for adults that at least tries to encourage thought and discussion about important issues, but at the end of the day Joker fails to deliver a clear message of any sort. Of more concern is the fact that this is clearly a reimagining of Taxi Driver (which is a vastly superior film). Skip this Phillips' rip-off and see/revisit Scorsese's masterpiece. Cheers"
3783,"I honestly thought that this movie was gonna be disappointing, but this movie surprised me.First I looked at how the director portrayed the character Auther Fleck, Aurther Fleck is portrayed as a depressed caring son for his mother, Aurther Fleck has laughing issues which results in him committing crimes. Let's take the train scene for example, you can feel the pain Aurther feels when he laughs, he tries to explain why he is laughing, but he cant and it really pains him and since Aurther had so explanation to his laughter in the train, the 3 men on the train start beating him up, at this point Aurther is truly struggling and remembers the gun he was given and he does what would come to mind which is shooting the men. Now you can see the anger in Aurther as the last person tries to escape, Aurther finishes him off, but he realises what he did, he realises he has just killed 3 men, so he panics , he runs to the bathroom and dances his stress off, and this scene was amazing and dramatic.The pacingThe pacing in this movie was average, on a scale of 1 being slow and 10 being fast I would say that this movie was 6, because some scenes were a bit fast, but then they would balance out.In conclusion I would give this movie an 8/10 due to the incredible acting and an amazing story with a balanced pace. I highly recommend to watch this if your older than 13."
3784,I must say...I made a IMDb account just to write my first ever review of a movie. Yes it's that good. This movie blew my mind! It was dark but great. I'm not a huge superhero..Gotham..joker fan of any kind...I may be now though..hahah. but it didnt matter this movie had me on the edge from start till end. And I wanted more! Just a great movie...WOW
3785,"Hard very hard work for mr. Joaquin , I think he really suffer to achieve that amazing actuation level.I dislike that psycho and mad criminal character, but I very impresive how capture my attention."
3786,"Joker is not a movie about comics, like the ones we get used to in the Marvel Universe. Although released to tell the story of the origin of the arch-enemy of Batman, what you see here is a big, dark, and dramatic story about mental illness.At the beginning of the movie, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) laughs at his visit to the social worker (where he gets his medication). Arthur's laugh most resembles a painful and uncontrollable bout of crying. Going out into the street, he finds a filthy backdrop of a Gotham City paralyzed by a garbagemen strike. Some recognize a resemblance to Scorcese's Taxi Driver's New York.Not coincidentally, another essential character is the humorist and host Murray Franklin, lived by Robert de Niro. He is the opposite of that character he lived in another Scorcese movie - The King of Comedy. In Joker, De Niro is the boisterous host who is admired and imitated by Arthur, who spends the nights in the company of his ailing mother, Penny (Frances Conroy), watching the show and fantasizing about participation.Arthur works as a professional clown, animating birthday parties, and singing to sick children in hospitals. From reserved habits and oblivious to social contacts, he ends up being a victim of bullies, beaten on the street, ignored in his performances, and ridiculed by Murray in a video of a stand-up performance.A co-worker gives Arthur a weapon for self-protection, and access to this artifact seems to be the way through which a tormented and divided mind could find a way to express itself. He twists his bony torso in front of the TV with his .38 in hands. By then he is no longer Fleck: an evil entity inhabits him, in an almost imperceptible transition.When things start to get out of hand, Arthur is invited to the Murray show and asks to be called the Joker, name of the card with a jester. That's an appropriate archetype for a victim of society and influential politicians, like Thomas Wayne (future Batman's father), who calls activists ""clowns."""
3787,"It looks like Todd Philips has decided comedy is actually dead and he went in a new way of filmmaking. Joker movie is an amazing idea of his; take the famous villain who is an unsuccessful comedian -I think he know how someone fails in comedy- write a sad, traumatic, epic origin story for character with Scott Silver, get some inspiration from Scorsese's films, go to Warner Bros. and take some serious money, convince an amazingly talented actor for that role... With all that material, a visionary director can make an incredible art house/comic book movie and that movie can be one of the greatest ones of its year. Winning Golden Lion from Venice is a huge achievement. Also; if Joker wins some Golden Globes or Oscars this year, I wouldn't be surprised. Especially Joaquin Phoenix deserves as leading actor. He was brilliant."
3788,"The Joker movie was hyped up from the subreddit 'Gamers RiseUp' late 2017 and until the movie was officially announced, gamers across the world came together ridiculing people of other ethnic groupsone big hype, was for the Joker to be an advocate for gamers everywhere by saying the line ""we live in a society"" which to their suprise, Joaquin Pheonix promised to say the famous line
but in the film, Arthur Fleck/the Joker never lived up to his promisethis makes me think, that the people behind the movie, were a bunch of CHADS who wanted to make gamers look bad and catch it all on one convinient page and then just straight up quarantine itdo you know who else were obsessessed with catching large groups of people away from society and later taking away their lives, NAZIS
I rest my case"
3789,"This was difficult to watch at times, but hella captivating throughout. Arthur's reasoning is believable, his sanity is questionable, and his life is indeed one hell of a joke. Like watching an extreme example of what happens when people on the lower end lose access to social programs. This can very easily be taken as a commentary on mental illness kept unchecked. More than that, it's a story about a guy who accepts his ""crazy"" and transcends poverty, circumstance, and societal... at everyone else's expense.Don't expect Joker to be a feel good movie. I mean, unless you're into really dark humor and comeuppance. It's the kind of film to discuss with others afterward and really think about for awhile. If you want a 2-hour Cards Against Humanity experience, see it with others. If you don't want to fail other people's litmus tests, absolutely do not.While others were (constantly) reminded of Taxi Driver (1976) and King of Comedy (1982), only the former of which I've seen ~10 years ago, I was not thinking of any other films the entire time.
Things I Liked:1) The notebook.2) When she tells it like it is.3) The first solo dance.4) The way the third (staircase) dance was done, especially at the end.5) The sadness of Arthur.6) The kindness of Arthur.7) When the Joker is fully formed.8) The tensity of the ""talk"" scene.9) When the body is laid on the hood.10) The disturbing feel of the last dance.11) The fact that I'm pretty sure I saw Donald Glover with a cloth covering his mouth at the end.12) How oddly it sat with me while I watched the credits.
Favorite Joke:
""The worst part about having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you DON'T.""
Statement:1) When your savior is a madman, there's either something wrong with society or something wrong with you. Probably both.2) I can see the potential problem with this film being released in the US right now. On a certain level, we didn't need this with our current political climate. On another level, the matters of class, social programs, mental illness, medication, and who gets to decide are all worth portraying. Meh.3) If you know your kids are gonna see this one way or another, consider seeing it with them and starting a conversation about its topics after.
Question:
Was Arthur right?
Was Joker?
Disclosure:
I watched and discussed the film with a very diverse group of people."
3790,"Oh, what a fascinating character study this was! I thought nobody could portray the Joker better than Heath Ledger did in The Dark Knight, but then Joaquin Phoenix came along and proved me wrong. As I watched Joker, I could actually feel myself spiraling into madness and becoming increasingly disgusted by the inequities of society just like Arthur Fleck did. I would go off the deep end like him if I lived in Gotham City, too. He puts the ""anti"" in ""anti-hero"". I deeply hope Phoenix wins the Oscar for Best Actor for this delirious, three-dimensional performance. Because of its stellar acting, atmosphere and climax, I give Joker a 9/10."
3791,This is a very dark and disturbing movie like a tailor furs. It is not for everyone. But as someone who enjoys dark comedy and other dark films I enjoyed it. The acting was phenomenal and the production value was great. I especially liked the cinematography and score of the joker.The story itself was a dark and twisted tale that did not disappoint.
3792,With this movie i loved joker and batman again and joker not like suicide squad
3793,"Some would try to sell me the idea that this movie is about how The Joker (Heath Ledger) was created,but I'm not buying it..to me it's just a mental-illness-awarnes movie..period. If it was called ""Sad Clown"",would it still be great? Hell yes!!!..it was fantastic.. Into the realm of the mentally challenged. It does not remind me of the Batman franchise at all..even though Bruce Wayne's name gets mentioned once and in the end his mother and father gets killed in an alley way. It rather illustrates the pain,suffering and misunderstanding of people suffering with mental illness!"
3794,"Feels like it could have been a 10/10 if they added 15-20 more minutes to make him a more DC-type villain.
Hits close to home and enlights mental illness which I think is a big win.
Feels a little bit edgy from time to time, maybe it was the hype."
3795,"I luv love loved the movie Joker19 ..... man o man fer such a small minded man he sure stood up n got noticed, way to go Arthur let me know when you will returnscience = indirect, he mixed his mind in othersmath = at breaking point his growth was exponentially satisfying to the masses the resultant longevity of logarithmic lashings linger timelessit doesnt cost anything to be nice sfsabean"
3796,"With all the hype behind this film it would have been easy to fail, but it doesn't. This film is original and doesn't have any filler. Everything adds to the story and means something. You sympathize with Arthur but at the same time understand and see him slowly losing his grip (what little he had) over reality. This was extremely real, and not the slightest bit cartoony and it was much better for that.A great soundtrack and very well acted, don't expect a bunch of humor, but expect to feel this film. Buckle up and enjoy the ride"
3797,"I've never written here; I've been moved enough by other films, but this one moves me just a bit further.Joaquin Phoenix is certifiably one of the greatest of all time. I've rarely seen a performance on par with Daniel Day Lewis, but he equals him in this role, and I've never seen ANYONE equal the talent of Lewis, who before I saw this was far and away the greatest in my opinion.There are lines and parts of scenes in this film that haunt me still, and I saw this a month ago.""Why would I steal his sign"" is one of those, and it is delivered in a way that is indescribably pitiful, and hopeless and simultaneously genuine and pertinent. It haunts me. That character haunts me.This is definitely one of the greatest performances, if not the greatest performance by an actor in film history."
3798,"I think this movie is a good start for potentially a great joker. As a movie this was great, but for a Joker movie/DC movie it didn't quite hit home for me.Firstly it's the thought that this is Joker, this is the arc enemy of Batman, I didn't quite see the mastermind nor the insane personality of joker. What I saw was a relatable Joker, and I didn't quite fancy that. It's easy to judge because this is the origin of Joker and will eventually build up to the insane mastermind that we love.The climax wasn't that impressive either, suddenly the city is in chaos because a clown shot a news reporter on live TV? This was a really cheap way to end the film and it could've been executed way better.All in all, this was a great movie and I'm excited to see if the joker in the sequele can live up to the great Heath Ledger."
3799,"Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie.Great Storyline,Incredible Acting,Great Cinematography,Great Musics.Very Tragic,Sad and Dark.This Is A Story About A Man Who Loses Everything,A Man Who Just Wanna Be Happy,A Man Trying To Make People Happy,A Man Who Laughing But Crying Inside,Story Of The Joker
10/10"
3800,"This is the movie than none of us knew we needed! Embrace this, feel it, live it. Mental health is worse than Cancer, listen to each other and this will be be prevented."
3801,"I have never been a superhero fan, I like Superman as a kid and that's it. New Superman films had zero interest for me. I wasn't surprised when they all turned out badly. I didn't expect much from Batman Begins but I remember being very impressed when I watched it. However nothing compares to the feeling upon watching Joker!Wow they nailed it. Goosebumps and can't stop thinking about how perfect the film is.This is how you do a gritty realistic comic book origin story. The film is Dark, Tense, Frightening and Relevant. The plot is completely believable, it's impossible not to feel for Arthur Fleck.Film critics have been hurting the film industry for a long time with their less than honest reviews, but recently in the age of Wokeness, its gone to a whole different level. See the Tomatoes Review from critics versus the audience score for example. This is a film that actually lives up to the buzzwords.This is the best film I have seen in years by far."
3802,Joaquin Phoenix should deserve a Oscar for his portrayal of Batman's main villain as the Joker.
3803,"I know the name Todd Phillips from his first feature as a student film maker, the 1993 cult documentary on extreme punk rocker, GG Allin, 'Hated: GG Allin and The Murder Junkies. Joker has a few references to GG littered throughout. Joaquin's performance is breathtakingly outstanding. Fantastic movie. 10/10"
3804,Joaquin phoenix is beautiful. From being the most vulnerable to become the most ruthless this is momentous movie. Stirring background music and best director of Todd pholips with awesome cinematography. If you have not watched this then you don't deserve to watch any movie.
3805,"Todd Phillips really hit the ball with this film. DC hit the ball with this film. Joaquin hit the ball with this film. A masterclass of a performance depicting a man whose conscience and self is corrupted by society and a few REALLY bad days.A film of this calibre can pass on in the horror genre. Its scary, its REALLY scary. It rubs off you with questions and concerns that are still relevant in our society today. It makes us think, ponder the questions and thoughts that we put off because they frighten us. Sure it doesn't pass on with elements of various horror films; jump scares or supernatural/unusual beings. It has something worse, the reality of the bottom caste of society.The Joker is not a celebration film, not a happy ending or a fairytale. It's in the title itself, one big 'joke' and only one individual truly understands this... That individual is in the title itself."
3806,"I thought it was an amazing film. The biggest problem I noticed when I first saw the trailer is the joker is an artist and not clown.But the film really does stress on how someone can really switch in there mental state.Joaquin Phoenix preformed amazingly throughout the whole film and it really was a masterpiece. Not just with Joaquin, but with everyone who had any involvement in making the movie happen."
3807,"Joaquin Phoenix with a Jake Gyllenhaal Nightcrawler-esqe performance. The way he's able to make you feel uncomfortable and anxious with just his facial expression and mannerisms was incredible. The uncontrollable laughter was painful (in a good way) to watch.
I saw it opening day but waited to do a review until I got to see it again; and boy was it worth a second viewing. All the little details about Arthur's neighbor/girlfriend was right in front of us the whole time.
I do however, feel for Jared Leto. He's going to be remembered as the ""d a m a g e d"" Joker in between Heath Ledger and Joaquin Phoenix.
Great movie and totally deserving of all the praise it's getting.Also, I love the way Joker says ""Mur-RAY""."
3808,"Joker starts off as a slow movie following the character Arthur, who is a mentally ill man who faces many problems throughout his life, however this movie which was slow for about 15 minutes of the movie soon takes a turn and introduces a roller coaster of emotions, which can make the audience feel both uncomfortable and intrigued. This movie also makes the audience ponder on the joker's actions, should you sympathise with what he does, or should you feel horrified. Joker also introduces these emotions with Joaquin Phoenixes Oscar worthy performance. Acting as a clinically insane man broken down by society would be difficult to play, however I believe that Joaquin Phoenix did an incredible job playing the Joker and I don't think it could have been done any better, same said with the story. Now I'm not going to spoil the story but I do have to say the story is completely different and adds a whole lot of surprises compared to the trailers. But don't let this stop you from seeing the Joker. The story is better than the trailers as it is a lot more interesting and gripping. That being said Joker does have its small problem, the music and sound. Don't get me wrong the soundtrack is great, but the original composed soundtrack feels out of place at times and takes a little while for the audience to really understand the emotion that that sound gives, however this is only on a few scenes so it isn't that big of a problem. Joker is definitely a different take on the criminal mastermind that we are normally used to, and it's an extremely good version of the joker and one which may have an impact on different comic book characters in the superhero movie genre. Overall Joker is a 95% out of 100%, it is a masterpiece and the jokes are on you if you don't go out and watch this movie or watch it on its disc or digital release."
3809,"As i IMDB Member For Almost 8 years This is my second review After Interstaler,
After all these Years I really never felt Like wow I have to review this ,But, ""JOKER "" =Joaquin Phoenix, Changed everything, I left the Cinema Speechless couldn't speak for almost 1hour , Joaquin Sir , you have Toped My Best acting i ever seen from the one and only Al Pacino in scent Of Women ,Thank you For this masterpiece Joaquin and the Director Todd Philips,And the rest crew members , one more point for the who made that wonderful soundtrack music !!BRAVO!!
If You are Really A true cinema Lover You should Watch This ."
3810,"Joaquin was amazing and I found this take on how this mentally ill man becomes the villain and the voice of a whole movement to be very interesting and innovative. But the end spoiled it a bit for me.
I would've loved to go out and think: wow, so this makes sense. A villain made by society because of negligence...
But when I saw the end I (and probably lots of you too) thougt: oh, maybe it's just a mentally ill person making that story up or imagining he's the joker. I'm not even sure if we are really in the DC universe or if this is supposed to be a story of a mentally ill person in our world who read too much comics.
I get that the point of the ending was to get the viewers to have their own theories and discuss them, but I found it unnecessary for this movie.
I think it would've been enough to make this movie a really new and different take on the Joker origin story and just let it be that!But again, I think it was a great movie and that dancing scene on the steps was hypnotizing. Could watch it over and over again!"
3811,"I admit I'm a Batman addict and I think you need to have a leaning towards the genre in order to under stand this production. Earthy, dark, gritty, deep and intense. This film is a superb representation of Gotham pre Batman.The acting surely deserves an Oscar, simply stunning portrayal by Joaquin. The little touches with a small nod towards Bruce clearly paves the way for a sequel. I just can't wait!!"
3812,"Phoenix should rightly get an oscar nomination for his portrayal of the joker.This film did not have enough 'story' from the fictional world of the joker and batman and villainy in Gotham city.Instead it focused on a disturbingly realistic and harrowing portrayal of mental illness.In films we like are badies to be bad, and be evil, and to be fictional. We go to the movies to escape real life.Instead Phoenix's vivid portrayal of mental illness and the films focusing so heavily on it. Made it too disturbing and horrifically life like to be enjoyable.Phoenix has showed his amazing talent as an actor the films mistake was in exposing the audience too much too it."
3813,"I have never liked joaquin. but this movie was the best i have seen in as long as i can remember. i thought i would sound like a shill till i read the other reviews. i guess everyone knows this movie is as good as it gets. what else can i add, except, there were times in the movie when he danced. you just have to see it."
3814,For me it was everything! Every second is a masterpiece. Well done
3815,Joker and Hong Kong. Do you know? Hahahaha.I love Joker
3816,I thought this movie was great! Joaquin Phoenix did an amazing job playing the Joker. He nailed the part!The storyline was great and I loved how they merged the end of the movie into the Batman storyline.
3817,"When I first heard news about them making this film, I was immediately hooked and became excited to see what they will do with the character's story. Joker is easily one of the most popular and intriguing characters in entertainment. Yet he is not a character that can be so easily defined, which can be seen in the comics. Joker has been in the world of comics since 1940 and he has captured our attention. His story has been told time and time again having no one specific origin story, which makes it a challenge for filmmakers to tell the origin story of such an infamous character. In the case of this film, it's best not to treat this story as a strict, clear cut origin story but rather it's one of multiple possible origins. As Joker once famously put it in Alan Moore's Batman: The Killing Joke, ""If I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!"". Todd Phillip's Joker takes the story of the Clown Prince of Crime to new heights and gives a take on a classic character unlike anything we've seen before. It is something new and different, unlike any traditional comic book film made in the last decade.As I mentioned a moment ago that this film is not like your traditional/standard comic book film. In this day and age where we are dominated by Marvel's blockbuster cinematic universe and DC's attempted efforts, it's easy to make the assumption that just about any film related to comics will be another traditional comic book film. That is simply not the case for Joker as it is something infinitely more. Joker is a much darker and grittier take on his story, but in the form of a deep character study. This type of story allows audience members to become deeply involved and invested in the character's psyche and you as the audience member must take in as much information as possible in order understand the character and story. The film exceeds in that area greatly by taking us into a dark and cruel universe and see a man who has lost his way and more importantly- how the character is this way. Beyond the great character study aspect of the film, there are other several elements that make this film complete. Those other elements are consistent of the acting /performances, direction, writing, cinematography, music and production design.Perhaps the biggest and most outstanding part about this film is Joaquin Phoenix's brilliantly terrifying performance as Joker. Phoenix brought such a neat and in depth look that allowed him to fully embody this character. Compared to previous versions of Joker, Phoenix's portrayal felt very personal and I believe that is largely due to this film's deep focus into the psyche of the character. Phoenix created two insightful perspectives, one for each persona of the character. One persona being Arthur Fleck(the man beaten down by society- before the madness began) and the other persona being Joker(the true, real Arthur Fleck- the end result of society's beating). One question I know people might be thinking of or have already thought of... was Joaquin Phoenix's performance better than the late Heath Ledger's? To be honest, I still hold Ledger's performance as the top one of all the other actors who have taken the opportunity to play this character. As for Phoenix's placement among the other actors, I would admit that Phoenix came pretty close but Heath Ledger's Joker still remains the best of them all.The directing and writing of this film go hand in hand, especially since there was some concerns of Todd Phillips taking the helm. For the most part Todd Phillips is known for comedies such as the Hangover Trilogy, War Dogs and Due Date. so when Phillips decided to make the transition from comedies to dramas, he managed to make the transition very well. Phillips handles the material greatly, exposing what talents he has for turning a comic book character's story into a dark and gritty examination of a damaged individual's mind. In part of the Phillip's direction, the writing aspect is something to take notice of. Rather than do a direct/traditional comic book adaptation, Todd Phillips and Scott Silver take a well known character with many different origin stories and create a completely original feeling story. Beyond being inspired by the comics, writers took the opportunity to put in some real life influences into the world in which the story takes place in. Mental illness, problematic social interaction, violence in society and more- all culminate together to make this film feel real. This type of realistic feel/quality has definitely made some people feel unnerved or even scared, which I don't blame anyone for feeling that way. Some have went on to complain that it will inspire violence, but I believe myself and many others find the film to do the exact opposite. I find the real intention of the film is for audiences to think how much society itself plays a major role in how we can create social monsters as well as understand society's intricate problems in order for us to fix them. It serves as a cautionary tale for all of us to take note of.Another important aspect that made this film so outstanding was it's beautiful cinematography. There were some truly gorgeous and brilliantly chilling shots captured by cinematographer Lawrence Sher. A nice consistency in the overall dark and grungy tone seen from the first shot to the very last one- nicely composed shots, flowing movements, and great shot variety throughout. They also put in a lot of detail towards the production design which includes but not limited to set production(value), lighting, costumes, makeup, props and more. The last big point I want to focus on pertains to the music/score. This aspect to me payed a large tribute in what made the film feel so unnerving and tense at times. Hildur Guðnadóttir created a series of musical pieces that evoke the vast and darkened emotions, which reflects both the character and the world. Every time I hear ""Defeated Clown"", I feel both amazed and terrified by its beautiful somber melody.Overall I found Todd Phillips's Joker to be another film that pushed boundaries and shifted things around for comic book related films. A really well-made and well-told film that will certainly not be forgotten anytime soon. A film that we all know deep down is fictional, but it does have a great many real world influences and lessons for us to learn.
Overall Star Rating: 9.1/10"
3818,"While part of me is annoyed that a gritty, socially-concerned drama like this only made over a billion dollars because of its superhero connections (seriously, without the Batman connection, I doubt at least 3/4 of the audience would have bothered to show up), I was still impressed with JOKER. It's stylish and atmospheric, both bleakly comedic and heartbreaking. Joaquin Phoenix does outstanding work representing his character's plummet into bitterness and insanity-- I cannot wait to watch the movie again, just to catch more nuances in his performance."
3819,I was very impressed with how the Joker evolved. It's dark and shockingly brutal.
3820,Best movie I've seen since Split. Phoenix more than deserves an Oscar for this performance. He was beyond fantastic. SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!! You won't be disappointed.
3821,A true work of art. Heath Leadger is proud of You Joaquin. The only Joker i admire after Heath Leadger. The DC finally gave us a man worthy of Calling JOKER. The psychological storyline and thr Oscar-Worthy performance of the main actor are brilliant.
3822,"Watched three times in a week. What a genius movie! The laughing, the dancing! A text book masterpiece in every category! Agree with the other viewer, how can this movie even exists?!"
3823,"This movie is definitely a masterpiece. It is a must watch and Joaquin Phoenix deserves the Oscar for his emotional, thought provoking and brilliant performance."
3824,"I'm sure there are some flaws in it somewhere, but I couldn't find any.
As long as you are not looking for a traditional Batman/Joker origin story and are OK with some gritty realism in your ""comic book"" stories, you will NOT be disappointed. This film is nothing short of brilliant."
3825,"**BACKSTORY**
If I had to describe this movie in one word, it would simply be ""beautiful"". From the cinematography, to the acting & improvising, to the outstanding score, Joker is by far my favorite film ever made.If you knew me before this review, you'd know that I used to always choke up when asked what my favorite film was. I could not answer, and any answer I gave was not sincere in the slightest. This one however, is.**IS IT A COMIC FILM?**
I will say this; it's not really a comic book film at all, it is *loosely* based off of the character ""Joker"", so you shouldn't go into this film expecting it to be 1:1 lore, but in my opinion that plays a key in making it so good. If this movie (in my opinion,) went with a more comic-like approach, I would not have enjoyed it as much as I do and I am certain about this. Take my advice, when you watch this movie, don't go in with the mindset that you're gonna see ""Joker"" the comic villain, go in knowing this is a film about a guy who just wants to make people laugh & smile, and is challenged by the harshness of the world he lives in. With this mindset, I can guarantee you will enjoy this film much more, just keep the DC lore to a minimal.I know what you're thinking, ""Well then, why is it called Joker?""
Like I said, it's *loosely* based off of the villain, and just a creative take on his backstory. Other than that, I don't really have any great explanations for you other than I simply enjoyed the film better by looking at it from a real world stand-point.**REVIEW**
Joaquin's portrayal of Arthur Fleck was phenomenal! He reportedly lost ~52 pounds for the part, and it really shows during the film. The performance is INCREDIBLE. His uncontrollable laugh comes to mind, as in every scene it happens you can just feel the suffering Arthur is going through, there's a particular scene that I won't go into details about, but let's just say finally catches a break, and it's all ruined from his nervous laughter. These moments really show just how great Joaquin is as portraying emotion, you can feel every bit of the character's emotions through this film. Everything from his uncontrollable laughter, to his adorable kid-like nature, everything about this character seems real and genuine like he lost himself in the part.Joker would not be what it is without the collaboration of Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips. Had Phillips not given Phoenix so much freedom, I don't believe this film would have been as successful and Todd know's this, he's acknowledged it in an interview with (I forgot who) by saying something along the lines of ""You wouldn't be a great director if you had an actor like Joaquin Phoenix on and NOT allow him such freedom."" Not word-for-word, but you get the drift.When you watch this film, pay attention the colors. The colors beautifully match the feeling of every scene, with the orange and cyan blue light's it really makes for a beautiful film, you can pretty much find a great still in every single scene that is filmed.**OVERALL**
I give this movie a 10/10 and I've never felt so sure about a rating in my life. I think it is perfect, and honestly I do *not* want a sequel, this film is perfect as a one-off and I HIGHLY recommend you see it in theatre's before it is too late, this is not a film you want to miss the experience of seeing on the big screen."
3826,This is a movie you got to watch in a life time. It is a great movie that indicates comic book movie can be this good
3827,Just finished watching it and honestly what an amazing film. I really didn't know what to expect from this film but I am so glad I watched it cinematography and the acting was unbelievable I would recommend to everybody !!
3828,"This movie is just unbelievable. I saw this movie after reading through endless articles praising it. I was so hyped up for this movie that I was bothered my own hype for it would cause me to be disappointed. However, the reverse happened and I'm surprised at how much my own expectations were exceeded.Do yourselves a favor and watch it on the big screen just to give the studio a little contribution of your own. This is the kind of film that has to be encouraged. Else, all we'll get is Avengers 200 and Avatar 10."
3829,Great story and a really great ending for a continued sequel.
3830,"Joaquin Phoenix gives an outstanding performance as the joker... This film is a masterpiece of how to tell a story that will allow the viewer to watch and feel every bit of emotion, every bit of anger and feel the sadness and frustration of person trying to survive in a city that ridicules and abuses him... The casting in the movie is perfect... I really hope we get another film allowing us to see the progression of this character... Heather Ledger did a fantastic job of bringing the Joker to life but Joaquin Phoenix takes in to another level.. Best film of 2019.."
3831,"Started off a little slow, but it was all important for the development of the Joker. Loved this movie and Phoenix has definitely earned all of the praise. The ""statement"" of this movie is loud and clear and I think it needs to be heard by as many people as possible."
3832,"Joker is an excellent insight (albeit exaggerated) of society's view of mental health.
Arthur has serious mental health issues, caused or at least exacerbated, by childhood trauma and his relationship with his mother. Society isn't able to support Arthur adequately and his delusions and mental health are spiralling out of control. The movie allows us to have pity with Arthur, where it's clear that the 'system' has failed him.
Throughout the movie society ridicules him, work mates, members of the public, the general population (via Murray's TV show). His interaction with the lady and child on the bus is a startling revelation as to how, even though the member of the public is made aware of his condition, still shows no empathy or understanding and merely shuns him.Under no circumstances can we ever condone the violence, but the question Arthur poses to Murray towards the end of the movie should be a stark warning.
Ultimately, the way we treat our vulnerable members of society, our tolerance, understanding, empathy and support will determine who how society will develop. And we may well get what we deserve.This is exceptional movie and will become a classic (although won't be on each Xmas 😄)"
3833,Wow impeccable timing and acting pulled off something special.Have to recommend this film despite how it makes you feel.
3834,"Ok folks, this was a job very well done by everyone . Oscar contender in a lot of categories and , most important , a mirror held in the face of today's society . No wonder we have so many nuts with guns killing at random if we treat each other like in this film .
One more thing : the Oscar for Heath Ledger was for his portrayal of a Joker at the top of his madness . This one done brilliantly by Joaquin Phoenix it show us how he became like this . That's for the people comparing to much one with the other .
They are both a work of masterpiece in different parts of time in the life of one poor schmuck . Yeah... i fell a bit of sorry for him like i felt the same for the godfathers of Coppola ."
3835,"Joker: I actually had my hopes up...and this film exceeded my expectations.
Film as an art form is alive and well."
3836,This film is excellent film I'm excited to watch the film have a soul of acting...........................................................................................................best movie of the year................ excellent direction........... outstanding performance............................................dldkxjcjcjjcjvjvjvj j j. j i i jcick j j j icijcjcjc j. kcxkk
3837,Absolutely one of the best movies I've seen in my entire life
3838,"I went to the theaters with a lot of expectations and I want disappointed .... I was actually blown away by this work of art .This movie was beautifully recorded, acted, and scripted from the opening scene to the ending credits .this movie gave us a new version of the joker that we've never seen before .. it gave the character the backstory he deserved .. and DC gave us the Joker solo movie we deserve... it's an origins story that will make you sympathize with joker,feel pity for him,laugh with him,like him, and of course fear him. This masterpiece was almost 2 hours long packed with a load of emotions .....I cant remember a single minute where i wasn't on the edge of my seat following every movement,every scene and every detail in this performance... and what a performance it was !!!!
Joaquin Phoenix nailed this role to no end, he was brilliant ! when the casting was revealed and we knew that Phoenix was getting the role I thought ""yeah this guy could deliver "" but I never expected this level of awesomeness and genius!
This film is a must see it will be remembered for a very long time ,I think it's by far the movie of the year and i guess both Phoenix and Todd Phillips deserve an academy award for this magnificent masterpiece !!"
3839,"The scenario was magnificent, the actors were wonderfull. Nothing more to say about it.
Best ever."
3840,"No spoilers, just to say ""watch this movie""! One of the best films I've ever seen and definitely the best acting performance ever by Joaquin. A movie that stays with you, I constantly think about it. Highly recommend. My son and his friends have seen it 3 times in theaters and always discovers something new. Oscar to Joaquin without a doubt. Bloody brilliant!!!"
3841,"The creative liberty given to the director/writers has given a new blend on the way you look at the joker. You don't need to be a fan of DC and/or the joker to engulf in to this epic saga of the journey of a transformation of a character. Every moment you have sympathy with the protagonist, he outsmarts you and surprises with the next move. The cringe it creates what happens next and results in another fiasco.All the time you ask yourself what he did was wrong, but was it the right thing to do at the moment ?
The so cleverly written movie was very well crafted and Joaquin Phoenix deserves all the respect on impersonating the soul of the character, Todd Phillip from his history of making movies has totally changed, He has become joined the big boys league now.
It would be a sin here not to mention clockwork orange and how someone is forcefully made into something, although joker here was more forced by the society.
And finally, Heath Ledger, the joker from the dark Knight, this was how a psychotic mind like him will become after few years past. Saying which one was better is a bad comparison to make. But with all respects to heath ledger, Joaquin Phoenix faced the gradient of character, which gives him the lead."
3842,A view of the story of Joker as we haven't seen it before.The movie was in general a good movie if only for the deferent approach that we see if I am not mistaken for the first time!The discussion should mainly be about Joaquin Phoenix!Once more he proves he is in the all star league.10 Stars plus one for him in his acting in this movie. Even if you don't like or you do the concept of the movie and if we should think about the society or not one should see it just for the acting!
3843,Love this ! (It was crazy). Be warned Joker is psychotic! If you can handle the mental delusion of Joker this is a 10/10 horror/thriller movie
3844,I'll be able to see this movie over and over again!!
3845,"Everything about this movie is outstanding, simply outstanding. From Joaquin's brilliant performance to the lighting, the mood, the music.I never write reviews but this is right up there with the best I've ever seen."
3846,"As a person who experienced real cringe moments when an acquaintance suffering from a mental disease no longer responded to medication, I was truly touched by Joaquin's interpretation. More because myself and others unconsciously played the role of the unsupportive people that such a person required in his/her time of need even if it wasn't expressed at the moment. Actually everyone needs to be more understanding with each other. The movie paints our society as it is right now, dehumanized. It's the world that's broken and does this to people like him, and even to normal people.
I can count movies that touched me on one hand, and this is one of them, most likely because of my personal experience."
3847,"I was watching this movie in 70mm, and what can I say, it was truly an experience everyone should try. With great acting performances, cinematography, production design, music, story and all that, connects and makes this a wonderful experience."
3848,10 out of 10. IT is BRILLIANT. I want to see it again in the cinema and buy the Blu-ray's.
3849,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, the use of color and the story were seamless"
3850,"I went in not knowing what to expect. The movie is incredibly well made. From the way the almost ambient soundtrack pulsates through the whole movie, to Joaquin's breathtaking performance to the awesome cinematography and the mesmerizing ending, this simply rocks. If there's more, please let me know. This was an excellent movie in a sea of drab."
3851,"Amazing, it's worth every single penny. The directing was excellent."
3852,"This film is the reason cinema was invented, fantastic story, really fantastic vision, cinematography and direction. Amazing performances by all cast and gripping film score. Deserve its billion dollar return. Massive well done to all involved"
3853,"I was given the warning that this movie was going to be one of the most intense movies that I have ever seen. In all fairness it was intense. However, I was not as emotionally connected to it as an intense movie demands. The reason being that the story writing wasn't tight; it was just this - an unfortunate victim of life-long systematic, social bullying kills everyone who had ever wronged him. I wish the story-line probed Joker growing out of his revenge taking mode and becoming a villain in the larger context.
The movie stood tall because of its imagery and an Oscar-deserving performance by Joaquin Phoenix. One of my favorite scenes where both these come together is when he's dancing on those never ending-steps just before his appearance on the Murray's show.The most important message of the movie for me was that - being nice to people, irrespective of how ""normal"" or ""abnormal"" they appear is important. We all have our own inner-monsters, nobody has the right to mock it."
3854,"This film is dark. It is interesting realistically because it outlines poverty, mental health, lack of resources and literally depicts events that could actually happen in real life. This film is not for the weak hearted."
3855,"Joker is that movie that leaves you breathless. You can't take your eyes from the screen, don't wanna miss any scene and when it's finished you are both thrilled of what you have seen and kind of depressed of all those people around the world who are ""not being seen"". Never forget his laughter that makes you wanna cry. Piece of art."
3856,"I remembered a lot of people calling out Joaquin Phoenix for being a potential joker and he sure is.I am not going to make this review long. The script is so fitting, the actors fall perfectly in their role and the cinematography was outstanding. The movie has a masterclass build up. In the build up of the movie they let us feel remorse for Arthur, but slowly we see him turn into someone we would all despite in real life. The music choice and the whole atmosphere in the movie was a story by it self.I am giving this a 10, because they really could have screwed up this movie and I am not greedy in giving ratings.Joaquin Phoenix, you did an amazing job and I would like to thank you for being such a talented actor."
3857,"Wowww, wowwww , wowwww the hype is real ,One of the best movies i have watched in years. when DC first announced that they are making a new joker movie , I couldn't imagine someone else portraying the joker role rather than Heath , but now after watching the movie , i must say that Joaquin was good as Heath , he was epic , his voice , dance moves , and his lough , omg how did he lough like this , he made it feel so real , you could feel pain and emotions through this lough , just wow , it is an oscar performance.
Now lets talk about the movie , where can i start , first , it is the movie of the year for sure, the score , script , cinematography and ofcourse the acting was perfect , you could clearly see an amazing and well written character development . I really don't understand the negative criticism on joker, saying its too dark and it encourages violence , i mean all of the violent games people play this days , like GTA, call of duty , pubg , fortnite , and people blame the joker being a violent movie ...????
In conclusion , joker was epic , and i give it 10/10 , and it is an oscar material."
3858,"I was initially sold on on its very first trailer, where I instantly realised that Phoenix's portrayal of Joker's humble beginnings would be another exemplary performance to add to his already prestigious filmography.
Now after seeing the movie in full, my assumptions are confirmed.This was a perfect example of how villains are made. How a history of abuse, trauma and neglect has resulted in a mental illness that has left our protagonist to function as a lonely awkward outsider on the fringes of society.
Most people in such a state are but a shadow of themselves, yet for men like Arthur, having hit rock bottom and awakening to the conclusion of having nothing left to lose, they set themselves free, allowing their alter ego to come out and play. And there's nothing quite as dangerous as a sharp and calculating man who has a few screws loose; loose enough to twist that moral code that most of us keep firmly intact.Although pure perfection, for me, would have it ending 5mins earlier, as he stood on the bonnet of that cop car, amidst the rioting, practically praised as the prince of anarchy. Had the credits rolled right then, in my mind, figuratively speaking, I would have stood up and given an applause consisting of five full-blown claps (that's three claps more than I'm accustomed to giving).I'm happy that this was the movie that the wife and I chose as our date-night outing. Last time we went to the cinema together was 7 months ago and were pretty disappointed with what we watched. But not this time. This time, we praised it all the way back home."
3859,"This movie was what I was expecting when I heard phoenix would be the joker, was it violent?? yes, but what isn't!Too many people judged the film before the release date so I'm glad it performed.Did it have influence from other films?? Yes, but all film do.I highly recommend this film to those that like the DC universe for what it is ~ Not Marvel.Why I gave it a 10
*Performance on point.
*Cinematography brilliant.
*NO CGI"
3860,"Don't remember when was it last time I went out of cinema without speaking with nobody for few minutes, I didn't hear anything people were telling me , I just wanted to absorb it a little more ... wow what a beautiful movie . True modern masterpiece , brilliant acting by Phoenix, superb character development , masterful way of letting the audience identify with what's wrong with today's decadent society ..."
3861,"Incredible movie, perfect storytelling and character development.
Mesmerizing performance by Joaquin Phoenix, in my opinion it's probably the best performance by an actor in any movie, EVER!Joker is not a typical Super Hero/Super Villain movie, it is an important and intelligent story which is built in the best way possible.This movie is a MUST WATCH.
Enjoy!
U"
3862,I don't give many movies 10 /10 but could think how they would improve it. The acting was simply amazing. If there's no oscars then it's a travesty. It dark and scary. Deeply sad and tragic. Violent and bloody. Bloody brilliant is what it is!
3863,"'Joker' is the type of film that you want to rewatch immediately yet never watch again; it's as deeply disturbing as it is utterly compelling, leading to a unique experience that truly sticks with you. The pure visceral effect of it literally lasts for days, and once that wears off the narrative still lingers in your mind, something truly rare in today's age of cinema. It's an incredibly grounded character study, with one of the most complex protagonists in years. He's not a hero, but not quite a villain either. It's far more complicated than that, purely because it's simply far more realistic than that. Arthur fleck is just presented as a person, one who you aren't supposed to empathise with but rather pity. The film never forces you to feel a certain way about him either, as it just shows the events in a relatively unbiased way, which allows for different audience interpretations. The filmmaking here is fantastic, with everything from the cinematography and production design to the haunting score putting most films to shame. It still astounds me that Todd Phillips directed this as it's in a completely different league to anything he's helmed before. For all it's technical, behind-the-camera excellency though, there's no doubt that this wouldn't have been nowhere near as successful without Joaquin Phoenix's masterful performance. It has been said before, but it needs to be said again: this guy deserves the Oscar. It's far and away the best performance of the year, and is perhaps one of the best performances I've ever seen. Phoenix's mere presence here demands your attention and he completely throws himself headfirst into the role, outdoing himself in the process (a very high praise for an actor of his talents indeed). Sure, the writing is great too, but Phoenix completely sells Arthur's transformation in such a convincing way that I'm sure the performance could have overcame bad writing had it needed to. Thankfully though, Phoenix is matched by the film surrounding him, which just solidifies how great the whole thing is. Like I said, it's a very disturbing, even scary, watch that is completely absorbing from the opening frame. It's not fun, but it isn't supposed to be. It knows what it wants to be, establishes this very early on, and rolls with it, completely sticking the landing. It's an incredibly accomplished work and if DC stick to this route from now on, they'll soon become the leading company in comic book adaptations. 9/10"
3864,"At the moment I could not remember other recent movies that convey a message so powerfully and so painfully. A complex but sharp and visceral message, brought first and foremost by the impressive Joaquin Phoenix performance and by the merciless script. The choice of musical themes and of a eighties-looking Gotham highlight instead of shading the ties to our contemporaneity. And there is more, even political and personal, for the attentive viewer."
3865,"De Niro did it first but I ain't mad!
Amazing film, great acting but I felt like I was looking more into the soul of Phoenix not the character- either way I didn't mind."
3866,"It's definitely The movie of Phoenix! Perfect acting! He needs to get Oscar! I found though the movie so depressing. I mean it's Joker, you do not expect s peaceful, full of joy moments but that was quite overwhelmingly depressing."
3867,Phenomenal performance I love the DC Comics and this movie is dark and gritty even disturbing at times this movie had me glued to the screen it's that good I didn't want it to end I cant wait for the follow up and apparently the Batman will be introduced and if its has dark has the Joker it will be amazing.10 stars
3868,So deep and emotional. Related to every person's life.
3869,"A particular film because it is an author film sold as a blockbuster under 17 years old. The plans are slow, working just like the light and the angle of approach not to mention the environments and the different places. This is the story of a character coming to embrace the madness of the world to make something of coloring red. The film is particularly good for his illness and is done in a rigorous way. Nothing has the area to be left to chance .. But I do not find this film excellent. It fits like a very good anti-hero movie such as we rarely see today alongside super-hero movies breaking the box office. The success of this joker can be because it fits in a time when the forbidden becomes allowed -17Ans, but especially that compare to what can do Marvel or DC; tries a sneakier and cinematic approach. Finally it may be the only movie that shows the cinema that we could see people fan of superheroes. That says a lot about our time. Thank you"
3870,Excellent story-telling and acting. Takes the joker character to next level.
3871,"Joaquin Phoenix - amazing performance.So fitting to have DeNiro as a costar, because JP is another DeNiro in the way he inhabits and immerses himself in his role.And like others I felt this was a statement on our current political polarization.Joaquin deserves an Oscar for this performance."
3872,Completely stand alone and stand out. Not a typical sickly comic book movie.
3873,The film highlights the real damage mental instability can cause in a person. The film was so correct it almost made me feel uncomfortable.
3874,"Give Phoenix an Oscar already. The man is a delightful surprise.
In Greek we say ""actor means light"" that was exactly what this man did for his character, he put some ""light"" into his personality.
One of the best performance I have ever seen."
3875,"I really lost hope on movies this year, but Joaquin phoenix came and surprised us, he showed us the role we missed in joker since The dark Knight, I hope you give this movie a shot."
3876,"A movie not to miss - if you are looking for DC universe super hero or a super villain story, this is not the one for you. This is a persuasively conceived chilling origin story for the archetypal villain of the Batman Macrocosm.
Joker is a failed comedian, an abused person who is soulful with a broken heart, an inherently caring person who takes it out on the ones who he thinks are reasons for his state of mind. The joker fights with his inner demons in a demonic way.
Have not doubts about this - it definitely is a comic motivated movie, at the same time it is far from anything you would think that can come from these Batman comics. They say it is a Dark movie - how wrong they are - it is a movie far from dark, it is full of light, bright and clear for the people to see and know about the ones which the world does not give anything about - that is the punch line of the movie in my view - Nobody gives anything about you - this is a movie about the anything they give back that they never got. This is a movie about the vulnerable, it is a movie about the defenseless, it is movie about the ones that are bullied for their good nature and left in the lurch, it is a movie about the complex actions of the mentally challenged but not cognitively or intellectually impaired.
It is a movie that makes us think critically about the ever present neglect of the economically less endowed in our society. It is a movie where we see people rise up instigated by accusation that the clowns contribute to the crumbling economy. It is a movie about the vacuum in the ethos of people and vengeful actions that fill that space.
The plot may look shallow and unnerving at the surface, once you dip your finger, it becomes unfathomably deep in perspective. Make no mistake, this movie can make many a viewer confused about the core theme of the plot.
The character study of Joker by Todd Phillips and the words put in his mouth by Scott Silver and most importantly the impeccable portrayal by Joaquin Phoenix is exemplary, it makes one gasp for words to describe the complex simplicity with which these three merge to give us a movie that is arguably one of the best in recent times.
The plot makes us think about the human pain, the narrative revolves around the innate anxiety of the weak at the same time it stays firmly grounded on some of the simplest aspects of basic human nature one can find in anyone. Retribution is a theme here in the plot, albeit allegorical and metaphorical in acuity. There are times in the movie that takes you along inside someone who wants just to exist, it tests one to the limits of one's thoughts.
The Joker's dance and the twisting of the contours of his scrawny shape after every act of vengeance is the hall mark of the Movie, the - laugh at nothing - cant be described in words, it is the class of Phoenix's acting prowess that takes you on. The music is a class in itself, unparalleled in comparison, Hidlur Guonadottir, the Icelandic composer who composed for Chernobyl does a score that will slowly seep into your inner mind. In a male dominated world, she excels unmatched. The Cello - of special mention is the track - Looking for Answers - so profound and reflective is the resonation that it starts to reverberate deep inside you mind. We get a sequence of Chaplin's Modern Times in the movie which in itself, I think is a message.
In all, the Joker is a stirring movie that has the potential to shake the insides of your mind - The movie transcends a master work of holistic art, it is simply a chef-d'oeuvre."
3877,"Joaquin phoenix perfect, like all the jokers. The classic story is told differently. A very familiar and very different story. Everyone should watch"
3878,"I have watched this movie !!!
Nah I was there.
Todd phillips and joaquine phoenix just boomed the Theaters.
Hat's off to you Sir's"
3879,"It's a movie about an uncomfortable yet pervasive subject. And it portrays it brilliantly. Of course not every mentally ill person is going to murder people, the message is we shouldn't allow people to find that place to begin with. This will be brief, so to sum it up, Phoenix earned an Oscar WIN and this movie should make you cringe. If you don't feel comfortable watching the movie, then it did its job."
3880,"Put on a happy faceWhaaaaaat, this movie is just blowing mind! It's just perfect the evolution of the Joker and how they become what he is, how all the things conspire to go wrong in your life, and not just the character is amazingly explored, the photography, the color palette, the plot, direction, everything wonderful! I just think that the beginning was pretty slowly, but when the joker start to act it's just perfect, the violence, the madness. Joaquin Phoenix crush it all."
3881,"There's not much to say about the story and direction as it's excellent.
The setting and pace give an absolutely fitting tone to the film. I think it couldn't be done any better, keeping in mind that the protagonist is a psychotic personality with mental issues.
Joaquin couldn't depict Joker in this setting any better and I LOVED his funny, yet manic, yet tragic ""Joker Laugh"". Don't compare this Joker to Heath Ledger's one. Both are different, yet AMAZING.
I have a single complaint about the film and that's why I'm giving it 9/10.
***SPOILERS AHEAD***
When Arthur ends up in Murray's show, they should have made him to actually be able to make people laugh and THEN flip out, starting to shout menacing at society and the media and eventually shoot Murray in the head. It would be so much more climatic and intense. At least for me..."
3882,"Joker is a phenomenal symphony of film leading up to a breathtaking crescendo.Joaquin Phoenix absolutely outdoes himself. I didn't see him in ""Her"" or ""The Master"", but knew he was special after ""Gladiator"" and ""Walk The Line"" - and his 2010 year-long performance-art piece ""I'm Still Here"" cemented him as a modern acting great. He was just as spellbinding with this interpretation of the most famous comic book villain of all time. Arguably his best work to date.But an actor can't be great without great material. And what (surprisingly) Todd Phillips has done with Joker is nothing short of genius. Not only has Phillips achieved what so few comedy film-makers do by crossing over into the provocative dramatic genre, he has produced a true masterpiece of movie material.Not for the faint hearted. It is disturbing at times. A result Phillips and his team set out to achieve, citing that violence has become too socially accepted in our media. We shrug it off and accept it as part of our entertainment, but with Joker he has made what violence is: Disturbing. Deeply uncomfortable. Painful. He makes the audience feel. An outcome very few mainstream film-makers achieve these days.The film is aptly titled. It is about absolutely no-one else other than its subject. Every character is simply crafted to present the film's focus: Joker. A deeply injured member of society who succumbs to his pain.Masterful film-making in a world drowning in a sea of meaningless media. Todd Phillips selected the best of the best to paint his picture. The strangely haunting score (which fit perfectly into Phillips' world), the perfectly presented cinematography, the costume and set design, the acting, the editing (sound and film!), all masterfully mixed into one of the pieces of the year.While it's unlikely Joker will walk away with Best Picture, don't be surprised if it gets a nomination. Plus a host of other category noms.It's not for everyone. But for this sociological ponderer, it was almost perfect."
3883,"What a performance by Joaquin!!! He was incredible and I loved this movie. I *am* a little confused by his mum's back story .. some gaps there.. How did she adopt if she was single (in the time this is set doesn't seem likely) where did Arthur go when she was hospitalised how did she get him back... and of course who ARE his real parents. I love that they gave this ""villian"" such a full origin story and well deserved moments of glory in starting an uprising against the wealthy. Hero &villain all in one"
3884,"This is a brilliant piece of film making. We all know that feeling when you are watching a movie and are totally transfixed to the screen and the situation, and the performance.
There are certain Movie critics in the UK who their editors should haul into their office and say "" What going on. You have given a bad review to a movie that is a smash hit , with many people saying it's a masterpiece."""
3885,"One of the best films I've watched in the last decade or so.
Performances are stellar!
Photography is superb!
The social messages the film promotes are phenomenal!
The soundtrack is so brilliant and fitting!
Do yourself a favor and go watch this film now!"
3886,"A raw depiction of a world locked inn social injustice, beautifully wrapped in a super-villain adaption. A must see."
3887,Absolute masterpiece. This film has some strong words to stay about society that everybody can learn from. Will forsure be in the best picture race.
3888,This movie was great! I love joaqin as an joker he really captuerd his essance really hoping for a follow up!
3889,A god tier performance from Joaquin Phoenix gives us a new look at the Joker.
3890,"I must say that I was very sceptic at first that I was actually going to like this movie, the reason being I was not very much of a Phoenix fun. BUT I was absolutely flabbergasted! His acting, his posture, his movements, his facial expressions - he nailed it, and he really deserves this rating 10. Beautiful shots as well largely contribute to a general feeling, ""Oh, boy, the best two hours of my life.""
The message: look around, 'jokers' are everywhere around us....unfortunately, it's we who make them us) who they are, it's their(our) own families who create jokers, it's the whole society, and the way they treat them from the moment they are born,who makes these Jokers, waiting their moment to explode. He is an antihero, misfortune permeates his whole life, but you simply cannot but sympathize with him...as you sow, so you shall reap."
3891,This film is crazy and beautiful make you think about mental health and how it can affect someone so much it changes there life
3892,"I'd been resisting seeing this film for weeks watching others and admittedly not really enjoying any of them. Finally there was nothing else of interest to watch so off we went.
The opening scene of laughter triggered a painfully visceral sense of discomfort. Like being hit with a 2X4 I was awake and focused. Like many others I did not expect this and I did not expect this from Todd Phillips so my bad on both counts. Powerful, moving and brilliant in many respects this seemed like a curtain going up to reveal a whole new form of film making. I couldn't help think of Dostoevsky's ""The Idiot"" and how it could be re-imagined so that today's audiences would flock to it. Using veils such as ""the Joker"" might just be the vehicle to make it work.
I'm also bemused at peoples comparisons to Heath Ledgers Joker. While the connection seems obvious, I'd suggest Ledger and Phoenix's joker should be judged independently as standalone works of creative brilliance.
Strangely I'm suddenly not interested in watching other comic book stories after seeing the Joker be they DC or Marvel.
If you like myself had/have any preconceived ideas, set them aside and see The Joker."
3893,"It is pretty much what I expected: a decent movie but not a masterpiece by any means.SPOILER FREE PART -The joker is a character study movie about the origins of the character, so of course the movie is entirely centered by him in almost every scene. Joaquin Phoenix I think did a pretty good job considering he plays such a huge role and I can't think of a moment where his acting was off, it all felt very convincing. I like the fact that his laugh was an unconditional mental illness thing and you can really tell that despite the smile he's very pained. You can definitely relate to him at times and feel his sadness, his frustrations, it's all portrayed very well. So hats off to Phoenix, he was one of the best parts of the movie. Aside from maybe two or three characters (and Joker), the remainder cast was very one dimensional and are a bit underdeveloped in a sense, and that's fine I guess considering how much screentime joker gets versus any other character.In terms of story it's serviceable, it's got its fair share of ""hiccups"" but thankfully not many at the last scenes. It's on the third act where things matter the most for this type of story and in the end that act was incredibly satisfying. I won't mention the details yet, but I'd say what you expect is what you get at the end and it'll leave you very pleased, so look forward to that.There's something to be said about this movie not having any sense of cleverness or wit, though, as I felt the message was very hammered in, quite literally shouting at your face at times, and there were plenty moments I thought were unnecessary or could use a grain of subtlety. Something less shoehorned that would've make it all the better but instead you're fed information that you already chewed, and fed so in such a gratuitously obvious way that made me go and think to myself,""do they think we're that dense?"". Also since this takes part in Gotham and the DC universe, expect some scenes that you can barely call ""easter-eggs"" of you-know-who, something that felt very forced and REALLY could've been toned down a bit.SPOILER PART -My biggest gripe with the story was with the female love interest character, a neighbor of the main character. I liked the idea that he fantasized (or hallucinated) her there by his side and the fact that she might've represented a person he needed most at his time of need, like during his big comedy gig or at his mom's hospital. Whenever she showed up I was always a little skeptical of it, not entirely fitting the pieces together until a bit before the moment of big reveal. By then I feel like mostly anyone would've figured that out especially when he goes to her apartment and she expresses clear discomfort to his presence, and yet they HAD to include flashback scenes of all the times she wasn't really there, making it painfully obvious by showing a shot of him with her, shot of him not with her, shot of him with her, shot of him not with her.Speaking of, any of the scenes with Bruce were painfully forced and didn't need to be there at all. It could've very much been an easter egg that this was set in that particular moment in his life, but they had to add so many shots of it. Shot of Joker and young Bruce at the mansion, shot of the Wayne family leaving the cinema. At that point everyone would've known, anyone in the audience knows Batman's backstory after all, but it keeps going. Shot of the Wayne family heading to a dark alleyway. Shot of Protester going the same alleyway and shooting Thomas Wayne. Dramatic shot of young Bruce looking at the dead bodies of his parents. It was just... lame, it's not exciting at all, it's just lame.The movie also starts with a scene of him dressed up as a clown... holding a sign that says ""everything must go""... and then being beaten by a bunch of kids for no apparent reason. It led me to believe this movie was going to be an egregious experience with just how corny it is. You can make the argument that it's purposely corny but regardless of whether it is or it isn't that scene was one of my least favorite and perhaps something about it could've been re-written.The final act like I said was very satisfying, having Joker yell at this man who's an ""icon"" of the big screen, for things he's very much justifiable for being mad about was very cathartic. I wouldn't say that his actions were justified but it didn't matter, he's a villain after all, and I enjoyed every second of it. It was very tense, it was very gripping, I loved it.There are other moments that bothered me a bit, the murder of the three men that immediately led to a protest and a news headline that said nothing but ""KILL THE RICH."" How the Joker entered from this large protest to this fancy building and the music immediately shifts to this stereotypical violin music whose frequencies could probably be translated to ""I AM VERY RICH."" Again, the beginning scene with him as a clown with that sign and being bullied was so corny, etc., etc.But in the end I'm still very happy with it. I would come back and watch it again especially for that last act. I thought Joaquin Phoenix's acting that was very convincing, other characters like Murray by Robert De Niro were also pretty entertaining. It wasn't exactly as good as I expected it to be but it was still pretty good none the less. Solid 7/10."
3894,"I saw the movie last night, it's just one of the best movies i have ever see! And i have seen a lot. Instead of reading these reviews, get a ticket and check out for your self this masterpiece!"
3895,"Amazing as expected! They better give Joaquin Phoenix his Oscar that he deserves, he is the best actor out there!"
3896,"Joaquin Phoenix, like every review states, is brilliant. From the macro to the micro- every movement, every gesture he makes as The Joker is perfection. By the end of the film, I could not ignore what I was watching was a clear reflection of what our society is on the verge of right now. Sure, it's extremely exaggerated, but it's hard to miss the parallels between the current political leaders of many nations and The Joker. He is a horrifically mentally ill psychopath who becomes the hero of hoards of misguided people. The Joker could definitely shoot anyone he chooses on 5th Avenue and not only get away with it, but be worshiped for it.In the end, it isn't The Joker who is scary at all. It's the CULTure of blind-followers who suddenly woke up to to prop up a madman, and none of them even realize he's absolutely out of his mind. Sound familiar?"
3897,"This film slowly gets you gripped - Joaquin Phoenix must be a dead cert for an Oscar !
Was not sure what to expect but slowly the film absorbs you and mesmerising you with the performances.
Quite gruesome at times - Great performance by Robert De Niro.
But it's Joaquin Phoenix who is simply outstanding - The dance scene to the music of Gary Gltter is just pure magic.
Left the cinema physically drained not felt like this after a film for a long time.
Best picture for Oscar in my opinion
Simply breathtaking !"
3898,"What a magnificent film is this!
Particularly compared to the cliche crowd-pleasing films. And even more so compared to the typical super hero movies.
I walked into the cinema with limited expectations, thinking this might just be another crowd-pleasing, CG enhanced, rehash of another super hero story.
Nope! Not at all! The story is fresh, and blunt, and nuanced, and relevant. The story has all these amazing qualities that are not normally present for films in the super hero genre.
Joaquin Phoenix is magnificent in it, absolutely, without a doubt. I also particularly appreciate that the director has chosen such a particular story line for the film, positioned the film with a particular direction, and allowed Phoenix to embody the role to this magnificent depth.
The film showed so much promise, that I felt there was still potential to allow even more depth and more grounding, which is why I'm giving it 9, rather than a 10. But, it's an excellent film, and Phoenix could not have done a more perfect job!"
3899,"...in every second you see and hear(!) the movie. I created this account just for writing this review. If this is not getting at least the Oscar for best sound mixing/editing, score, film editing, cinematography, director, leading role and picture, I'm out of watching movies. To make it short: This is art!"
3900,From the very beginning till the end. Everything is top.
3901,That the score has gone below a 9 is an insult. Joker is witout a doubt one of the top 3 movies of all time.
3902,"What happens when sickness finds itself in a world without physicians?
Joker is a film that asks this question in three images: the individual, how he's treated, and money, in the city. From the outset, Arthur Fleck is presented as a mentally ill individual whose therapist doesn't really listen to him. This is the film's first theme, what are the sciences of the mind supposed to carry out? If there are two kinds of mentally ill subjects: those born sick, and those sickened by our hand, clearly Arthur Fleck is an example of the latter. For those who are born ill, there is admittedly little that can be done. Surely it's a task suited for a scientist. But those corrupted by us, by our idea of education or lack thereof, are creditors to our debt. Precisely in this conundrum lies the heart of the problem in Joker. Can the sick cure the sick? Unlikely. Can the ignorant cure the sick? Still less. The film begs the question, what is psychology and psychiatry?
A science that purports to cure the mind, no less. There was once an art that aspired to this end, the ancient Greeks did their best to perfect it; albeit they didn't call their subject the ""mind"" but the ""soul"". They felt in their bones that to cure the mind is to cure its education, and to cure education is to cure politics, and vice-versa. Keenly aware that the individual depends on the city and the city on the individual, they identified Politics - the art of creating and applying the best laws - as the true means to a healthy city, and Justice (or duty, or ethics) - the art of paying all of one's debts - as the true means to a healthy individual. If we were to ask if the many can be effective at turning unhygienic minds or behaviors into healthy minds and behaviors, we might as well ask if the many can be effective philosophers.
Does Arthur Fleck, then, deserve our sympathy? Not our full sympathy, mainly because in his sorry state he commits matricide. But why did he do this? Anyone watching the film up to that point would agree that he loved his mother dearly. As a famous Genevan philosopher would say: ""Everything is good as it leaves the hands of the Author of things, everything degenerates in the hands of man."" Arthur committed this crime because he couldn't reconcile two things he knew to be true: that he was good, and that people had treated him quite badly. Deep down, he knew he was good. He knew he was warm, caring, and decent. His upbringing, a house of horrors thanks to his mother's abusive partner, which he apparently erased from memory, corrupted him. Even if Penny Fleck was lying about Thomas Wayne being Arthur's father, the fact remains that Arthur - a victim - killed in his madness she who was a victim along with him. It's an image not meant to be right, it's meant to be a mirror. What can't be expected from the Joker, or any incurable like him, is healthy behavior, as he himself writes in his journal. How could he be expected to understand what sane people barely do? That the solution to the problem is not violence but adequate understanding, speech, and legitimate means.
Then there is the possibility that Penny was telling the truth about Thomas Wayne; that he did make her sign a non-disclosure agreement; that his power and money swept her case under the rug. In order to understand the film's imagery on money and power, perhaps the best question to start off with is the following. Why did Penny believe Thomas Wayne was the hero of the city? Was he an eminent speaker? Evidently not. It's because what the city values most, what it holds in highest esteem is money. Therefore, a rich man must be city's sage. Trampled and traumatized by this barbarity, it's no surprise that Penny and the rest of the city would conceive of the hero not as he who cultivates reason but he who is rich. The brutality of the city's values shows itself in Arthur's condition - incongruence between what he felt and what he expressed. He was desperate to express himself but was too maimed and mutilated to do so, hence the dancing. The one moment in the film in which he laughs at the laughable, his mother tells him it's not funny. But it's the climax of the film that contains the desperate expression of this idea, he reproaches people for believing that whatever they think is right is what's right. His aesthetic is indeed classic. He doesn't understand why people would think that the truth can be whatever they want it to be. What Arthur would have said if he were healthy is that money unhinged engenders incongruence. When excellence and virtue aren't held in the highest esteem, when they do not inform aesthetics, money will determine values and aesthetic. If any of this seems exaggerated, remember that since 2010 money is considered speech in the United States.
The New York Times, the premier newspaper of the city Gotham is based on, published their star critic's review of the film. In it, A.O. Scott writes: ""To be worth arguing about, a movie must first of all be interesting: it must have, if not a coherent point of view, at least a worked-out, thought-provoking set of themes, some kind of imaginative contact with the world as we know it. Joker, an empty, foggy exercise in second-hand style and second-rate philosophizing, has none of that."" I would like to know, what does Mr. Scott know about philosophy? It's not a mean question; rather, one that must be asked because it's an important subject, and important subjects must be treated with utmost care; in some cases, life-long dedication. After all, in order to know what a second-rate version of something is, acquaintance with its first-rate version is required.
That Arthur may be undeserving of our sympathy does not mean Joker is not one of the finest films of our time. It is. It's polarizing effect, how it is so misunderstood, only lends credence to its message. The reason we don't understand Joker, or at least don't know what to do with it, is the very same reason why the Joker was born, the same reason this character is an image of what's wrong in the modern city. Ignorance cannot cure ignorance, and nobody can cure a city that doesn't want to be cured."
3903,"First of all the most attractive thing in this film is the Acting.. such a brilliant acting by Joaquin Phoenix.
The next best thing is the story. Really, this film is just like a biopic of Joker but the story is really awesome.
Next thing is its Screenplay. Such a beautiful presentation.
I really liked this movie. According me this is one of the best movie from DC universe."
3904,"From the beginning to the end, Joker will take you through a journey on how a person can be taken to the brink of insanity. Oscar worthy performance for Joaquin Phoenix, great score, perfect cinematography. Definitely will be part of my collection of great movies you can watch again and again."
3905,The actor is really good performing the joker but the story is a little off .
3906,"Joker"" is a 2019 film directed by Todd Phillips.
It is nothing but a message in favor of suffering people, forgotten and marginalized by the rest of society.
Today many people are just a mass of suppressants, selfish, cruel and exploiters towards the weakest needy. The reason why an individual behaves in a certain way does not matter. Only what others have seen count, I learned from third parties without making sure or investigating why he did it.
I hope the world changes.
May everyone realize that we are human beings who tend to do good but unfortunately we should move away from suppressors or those who represent antisocials. I hope everyone can realize how much we can do our best for ourselves and for the welfare of others. And that before judging a sick person, let everyone look inside their soul."
3907,"This is probably the most disturbing movie I've ever watched. Our point of view in this movie , shows us how society behaves , in the most extreme way.
Joker is no perfect , but so are the people who treat him the way they do. Such a great movie , this is going to last forever."
3908,"The film itself is not remarkable . having said that i am not a super hero movies fan in fact the only one i saw was the dark knight because of obviously Heath Ledger , but this movie was a bit slow based to a point that bores you and again Joaquin comes and grebes you with his amazing acting skills and the way he shifts his face and his voice is just so mesmerizing . although i think he had a huge responsibility taking the role after the late one but he was fantastic in it that i allowed my self not the compare the two . i said to my brother when we were getting out of the cinema that the first made you despise the joker and the later made you feel for him and amazingly justify what he did"
3909,Everything that comes to mind about the film was phenomenal. The cinematography was my favorite part; and felt like the world was closing in on Juaquin Phoenix without feeling too shut in. Several scenes including buildings whose walls extended to the skies that surrounded and closed in on the Joker set the perfect tone throughout. A few directions they took during the film made you question their direction; but by the end of the movie those uncertainties made the film more memorable and eerily satisfying. The performance of Phoenix and the cinematography would absolutely cause me to give this a rewatch in the future.
3910,"After seeing Joker, it kept me up late into the night. It's certainly an unsettling film. It differentiates itself from the rest of the villain- centric comic book films, like Suicide Squad or Venom, by not providing any counter force to the bad guy. In Venom and Suicide Squad those who usually would be the villains are faced off against someone who is a bigger villain and by the end of the film they're almost become the heroes. In Joker however, there are no heroes. The tone is somber throughout the film and there are practically no elements to invoke any positive feelings.Joker's real name here is Arthur Fleck and he's played superbly by Joaquin Phoenix. He brings his own flavor into the role and his performance is very physical. Not only did he lose weight for the role, but his movement, like his dancing, which there is surprisingly lot in Joker, is captivating. Joker is a standalone film from the rest of the DC Universe films and it tells the story, although borrowing cues from other famous movies, of how Arthur becomes the Joker. Whether intentional or not (although I doubt that due to Robert DeNiro's character) to me Joker resembles mostly Martin Scorsese's King of Comedy, taken only further to the extreme.Like Rupert Pupkin in King of Comedy, Arthur Fleck in Joker is delusional and socially clumsy outsider who wants to be a famous comedian. He's not a edgy master criminal here. Arthur also admires a late-night host, played by Robert DeNiro. Like Pupkin, Arthur believes his destined to be on the stage, only that he hasn't had his deserved big break yet. Only problem is that Arthur doesn't seem to understand other people or what people generally find funny. Or maybe it's his lack of talent. In Joker, much emphasize is put on the fact that Arthur suffers from mental illness like his mother, whom he cares for. Arthur suffers from a condition which makes him laugh involuntarily. This makes it even more difficult for him to connect with anyone as he may laugh in very inappropriate situations.A lot has been said about the violence and the depiction of a mentally ill person in Joker. It is indeed a violent film but compared to the likes of its role models such as Taxi Driver, it's nothing new under the sun. Maybe when compared to other comic book -based films, its violence and bleak atmosphere might seem like something new. However, as an actual social commentary Joker and its world feels too simplified. It leans its juxtaposition on the old poor vs the rich elite environment. It would be easy to say that the film is a warning of what neglected care for the mentally ill and the increasing wealth cap would cause, but to me it's just an environment where the film takes place. Sure, there are riots, mentally ill, rich and poor people in the real world too. But does it say anything meaningful of it? I don't think so. The idea that the films version of Gotham is an accurate depiction of today's society and where violence and murder are acceptable and admirable solutions to hardships in life is just too cynical and not all the way thought interpretation. Rather, the whole movie is about Arthur and his desire and inability to connect with the world, which in the end comes to pass in ironically twisted way.Joker is by no means a subtle movie. It constantly reminds the viewer of the bleak Gotham City in which Arthur lives and of the state of Artur's mental wellbeing. The world around Arthur is bleak and sometimes cruel. Everything bad that happens to Arthur seems to happen without his fault. All he wants to do is to bring laughter and joy into this world. He displays a sort of child- like innocence, which makes it easy to side with him. It's very manipulative, but admittedly effective. But once things start to take a turn for the worse when Arthur shoots three Wayne Investment employees after being assaulted by them in the subway, the sympathy I felt turned into pity. It's this stark turn that the film takes that makes it captivating. This contradiction also applies to the film's soundtrack, where its original tracks are very melancholic compared to some other old classics which are heard. As Arthur dances in a shady restroom after his first murders I realized that I do not understand him. What Arthur does in the film is no way excusable. He may have tried to defend himself on the subway by firing his gun, but then he starts to hunt down the other two. This isn't a story of Arthur discovering his true self or becoming what he was meant to be by taking on the name Joker, but rather it's about Arthur losing his way. This is a Joker I don't see going head to head with the Dark Knight. In fact, I don't see any future for Arthur.Joker isn't as dangerous film as it's claimed to be. Sure, it's intense and violent, and it's easy to draw some slim parallels between its world and the real world, but they are too vague and general that they do not contribute to anything. I also do not accept the idea that the film incites people to violence. In the film Arthur gains following through his acts of killing, but it speaks to the tragedy that he couldn't gain attention by bringing laughter and joy to the world, but instead through acts of violence and becoming uncivil himself.Joker from time to time goes out of its way to remind the viewer that it takes place in the Batman universe. Some familiar names drop by here and there, but I still don't see, nor do I care to see a sequel where Arthur goes up against the Caped Crusader. The ending attempts to leave you guessing whether anything you saw on the screen was real or not, but it doesn't really matter. Although I'm leaning towards the former. That's much I want Joker to be its own self-contained film in this era of comic book films where a movie is more concerned about building towards a sequel rather trying to tell a proper story."
3911,"I've been seeing this a lot lately with Hollywood movies this year. They are highly anticipated movies, with the biggest stars, and the coolest storylines, but they are a complete disappointment the first time you watch it. You start to wonder why the world is so worked up over this movie. And you feel cheated.But the funny thing happens a few days later, when you find yourself back at the theater to watch it again. Why, you don't know. But then it grows on you. And you notice something that takes your breathe away. And you realize why you love cinema in the first place.The Joker did that to me. It was a very strange experience into possibly the most deranged mind ever put on the screen. Whereas most criminals or lunatics in film act in a ""mad"" way, Phoenix's portrayal of Joker is someone who is without question mad from the beginning. He may have at first been acting mad, to get some sort of sympathy from people, but it appears that he not only ran with it, but extended that madness as far as he could take it. To sum it up, a guy like this shouldn't legally be allowed in public.Joker is a story of Arthur Fleck. Where the reality begins and the fantasy starts, the audience has no idea. But the general story is that Fleck gets fired from his job as a clown and kills some ""bully"" Wall Street guys on the train home, which leads to the entire city rioting about the ""rich versus poor"" debate. Arthur soon admits he is the one who started the riots and killed the men, and becomes the hero of the chaos.It's a really creepy film. It makes you want to take a shower after, and get a real life job.Go see it. It's a pretty amazing film.7 stars"
3912,"As of writing this there are 317,711 IMDB user votes, of which 9,654 are below 6/10.That's 3% of people that hated this film... for every 100 people, 3 people are C U N T S.Sounds about right in this day and age.10/10 great movie. Loved it. Will see it again, forget the dopes!"
3913,"In short, this is a decent drama about mental illness that, for some unfathomable reason, plays with the DC universe and the Joker character, although it shouldn't have. This Joker has little to nothing to do with all the previous incarnations we've seen so far, and the whole story kind of falls to pieces once you look away from the main character and consider the bigger picture.Also, as a side note: please stop it with the continuous (although more often than not unwarranted) reboots of entire universes/franchises and ""re-geneses"" of characters... I can understand the need to remarket a ""product"" to make it appealing again to new audiences, tastes and fads, and make more money out of it, but this is becoming ridiculous... (3 totally different Jokers in 10 years...)6.5/7 out of 10 (as a drama/crime story revolving around mental illness)"
3914,Yes it is indeed a great movie with an excellent performance by Phoenix. The script is well written so that the evolutionary path from a good guy to the bad guy is very convincing. Consequently you cannot help yourself but to sympathize with the villain.The only less convincing part is the studio scene after he admits a murder. If a guy dressed in a clown tells me he shot three people I as a talk show host would either not believe him or - if I believed him - immediately call for security and not continue talking with him. But appart from that small detail - a must watch movie.
3915,"Instead of watching him acting crazy, I saw a crazy guy in the movie. Can't shake off his performance from my mind even a few hours after walking out of the cinema....Joaquin Phoenix is going to win the Oscar!"
3916,"When one views this film for the first time, they'll be amazed at the film elements that make it up: cinematography, sound (especially the intelligent usage of music), Mise en scene. An area in which this film is almost perfect in is the performance of the lead Joaquin Phoenix- a performance that almost makes you forget the flaws in the narrative itself. Simply put, the social issues that Joker tries to tackle are tedious and superfluous. But I must praise this film for how it structures its narrative, because when you're viewing it in the moment, you never realise its flaws. But overtime, you will understand the holes that Joker pokes in it's story. A film that will likely be remembered not for it's narrative, but for the man who plays Arthur Fleck."
3917,"Definitely one of my favorite movies of all time. Joaquin is such a great actor I forgot at times that it was all acting and I empathized so much with his character. I got so into this movie and story that 2 hours flew, it had my attention the whole time. 90% of the scenes are pure masterpieces, when it comes to photography and writing, music is mesmerizing, fantastic. In the last couple of years i basically gave up on movies, mostly everything new was to some extent bad to me. I'm so glad that this movie was made and that i watched it, i will most definitely watch it again as soon as possible. The way they developed a character, the way that they included mental illnesses, society problems etc... i love it to say at least. This is in the first place psychological movie and then everything else, so know what to expect."
3918,"If you liked watchmen, you would love this.
Meaningful."
3919,Phoenix is superb. The film is awesome. There're not many films I would pay to go back and see but this is one. I despise superhero films with a passion...this is NOT one. It's in a class of its own.
3920,"""Joker"" is good. Joaquín does an excellent job as lifelong punching bag, Arthur Fleck. He lives with his unwell mother, caring for her and working as a clown for hire. He dreams of being a stand up comedian, working with his hero, Murray Franklin (played by Robert de Niro). But life has other plans. A childhood of abuse and neglect has caused Arthur some serious mental and social issues. But is it his ill health or the ill health of society that will be change him into the clown prince?""joker"" played well with ambiguity throughout its runtime. Besides the obvious laugh at inopportune moments, Arthur's mental state, heritage and fate are all cataclysmically mixed up in truth and lie. Where the joke begins and ends depends on the viewer. Even in its final moments, red footprints contrasting the dizzying peace of the blissful scene, its hard to know what has happened just moments before. Todd ""the hangover"" Phillips keeps a tight hold on Arthur's story throughout in his direction. The beautiful colour palettes and wondrous gaze of a camera lingering on moments of extreme violence is captivating, to be sure.However, Phillips' style over substance can onyy take him so far and where the film flops is in its decision to dig through the dirt of joker's origin story. Far too streamlined, the film seems to be more interested in ticking boxes on its way to a conclusion, rather than doing anything new. Perhaps his accidental rise to figurehead of a generation disillusioned by disparate wealth is a realistic approach instead of ""falls into toxic vat, comes back as criminal mastermind"" but none of the charm of the established Joker is present here. Hes just a sad sack with mental health problems. Even a turning point at the beginning of the final act in which he states hes ""not wrong, this is who I've always been"" feels untrue. Joker is a maniac and genius. I wish there had been more hints at his troubled but wonderfully corrupt mind throughout, instead of a final rant that gets cut short.Phillips aimed high, and the cast certainly pulled their weight, but the story, for such an enigmatic, charismatic villain of lore just does not do the source material justice."
3921,"Best joker I've ever seen. Simply the masterpiece.
the actor Joaquin is whorthy an oscar."
3922,Phoenix deserves an Oscar!!! ... his acting was outstanding!!
3923,"I understand the reasons for this movie sitting as a center for controversy, but for it's purpose of putting you in the shoes of a broken sociopath, you should expect nothing less than to feel uncomfortable. And it made me feel uncomfortable, in a way I wouldn't have dared to resist. I knew that experiencing his emotions would not only come with feelings of defeat and brokenness, but also the waking terror of a supervillain. It was perfect as an introduction for such a dark and derranged character, and shouldn't be seen as any less; Joker, as Pheonix or Ledger, will never be underestimated again with the new insight provided to his personal life."
3924,Excellent movie I enjoyed every bit of it. The acting was phenomenal. Go see this you won't be disappointed.
3925,"Brilliant, simply brilliant. Pheonix is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise stale year of acting. The movie is slow paced, working on the progression into madness by a man who has been subjected to negative experience after negative experience with a climax that is both satisfying yet questions both the audiences empathy/sympathy towards the joker 10/10"
3926,"It's a shame now adays that the so called know it all critics cant just watch a movie without injecting their own political spin on their opinion. A 59 metacritic for this while knives out started as 100 on tomatoes goes to show there is an agenda, and not a genuine critique.That being said, Joker is a phenomenal movie. It's a dreary journey through the mind of an iconic character and for the first time we get to watch every thread if his humanity get pulled away until he finally becomes who he really is, and to some extent, who we all are. The tone of this movie is consistent and his transformation is paces perfectly and believable. DC needed a movie like this to do this character justice in a way that did by look like it was drawn by Kane.Todd Phillip's nailed every aspect...from the music and timing of when and what played, the creepy and sullen atmosphere, the feeling of hopelessness till the final act...its hard at times to not root for the Joker even though you know what he becomes.I cannot recommend this movie enough. Critics have shown themselves and biased lemmings. Pay no attention to them. They are the very thing Joker is trying to stamp out."
3927,I loved every second. The movie becomes one of my all time favorite. I couldnt decide is it the director todd phillips or joaquin phoenix perfected the movie. Just a masterpiece i would call it mona lisa of cinema
3928,"This movie is a masterpiece. The performance is superb, so dark and so humorous.
Such a twisted mind from the abuse being abandoned as a child, being adopted, the lies he was told sets up the character. He's a therapist dream and a nightmare at the same. The movie was also such a social statement, people looking for someone a here if you may to release their anger and it did with Joaquin's performance. Their Hero the Joker"
3929,"Unlike any other R rated movie I've seen. The violence is so unsettling, shocking, realistic, shot and edited so well, and with the addition of that score, it really makes you uncomfortable as if you were seeing a real life footage. Demands your attention from start to finish, no second is wasted. And yeah Joaquin is gonna win an Oscar"
3930,"It was so perfect, the acting, directing, everything was perfect
The scene on the stairs it was absolutely amazing
The final scene when he was above the police car OMG!!
Absolutely beautiful"
3931,"Joker is a origin story of the infamous villian of DC universe. Its a mixture of violence and emotions. After watching this movie i have became a fan of director Todd Phillips (its the same guy who directed the comical triology The Hangover). His idea of presenting the story was fabulous. He knows how to intrigue audience with the story of the film. I have read many review of ths flim saying that the first half is slow but trust me i didn't feel that the first half was slow. First half shows the struggling mental state of Arthur Fleck aka Joker played by Joaquin Phoenix and second half shows his transformation to JOKER.
About Joaquin Phoenix he just showed us a new version of Joker as the character was played by a lot of great actors like Jack Nicholson and my favourite Heath Ledger. Can't imagine how much pressure would be on Mr. Phoenix to play joker but he did a fantastic job👏. BGM also adds more feels to this movie.
Conclusion : its a violent movie so very R rated but a must watch. A person need not have comic book knowledge to watch this brilliant peice of art as the movie has very less references to other universe. Everyone can watch this movie."
3932,"I was one of those people who were really sceptical about Joaquin Phoenix(because I never watched his movies before) and his looks as Joker. But after seeing the movie Isaw how wrong I was and especially after the scene when criminals put unconscious Joker on a police car, it really reminded me of Arkham Citys ending. All in all excellent, unsettling, horrifying movie, it even tackles some social questions that should be more discussed in movies, I would really recommend it to everyone."
3933,This Man deserves an Oscar soundtracks also the best that can ve.
3934,"Phoenix is brilliant, the whole feeling of the movie is just great, dark, and gritty. Just as it should be. But it's not a 10 for me, because I think it lacks in the scripting of the supporting characters; some feel really forced, just to give Fleck his stepstones. This contrast to his detailed portrait irritated me quite a lot.
But nevertheless, it's a must-see."
3935,"This is the kind of film that won't seize to creep up and haunt you for days or perhaps even weeks after you've first seen it... It definitely brought out the ""philosopher"" in me. I found myself asking the universe all kinds of questions about human behaviour..
What makes a man crack under pressure?
What drives a man to lose his sanity and commit vicious crimes?
Is society at all to blame?
If so, what's it's contribution?The laws of physics state that most substances known to man either have a boiling or melting point. All substances, once subjected to certain pressures or temperatures, either melt, freeze, liquidize, sublimate or simply decompose.A man's mind, psyche or sanity is actually no different in that manner.This is a film about a man's inner struggle to cope with his unfortunate and miserable life and the tragic chain of events which inevitably lead him to experience an emotional meltdown.Arthur Fleck, ""Joker"", is a ""monster"" created solely by society. He's victimized throughout his entire childhood and adult life by everybody surrounding him, including his own mother.Arthur suffers from a serious mental condition due to severe a physical head injury and mental trauma that was inflicted upon him during his early childhood, causing him to uncontrollably burst out into laughter whilst under mental duress.With this mental condition in mind, Arthur works as an underpaid clown on the verge of poverty, living with and caring for his elderly mother, alienated and outcasted by society and his peers at work, neglected by social services due to budget cutbacks, deprived of his daily prescribed medications, continuously humiliated, assaulted, beaten and battered by cruel people of Gotham City, left lying and bleeding on the ground in alleyways and subways like an injured animal, defamed and ridiculed on national television and dissuaded by his own mother.Life and reality as Arthur knows it have become much too overwhelming for him to deal with. He's like a ""ticking time bomb"" ready to explode at any given moment. The writing is on the wall. He eventually cracks - totally freaks out, losing complete control of himself and goes off on a killing spree.Though Arthur's actions are strongly condemned and CAN NEVER BE justified, it's quite difficult not to feel any empathy whatsoever towards him. Indeed, Todd Phillipps, the film's director, succeeded by intentionally instilling that thought in his viewers which continues to linger in their minds long after the movie is over...In my opinion, Joaquin Phoenix delivers the greatest performance of his acting career and well deserves an Oscar Academy Award for it. ""Joker"" is a true masterpiece of cinematography.My suggestion is.. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a big favor and go!!"
3936,"Such a breath of fresh air after 6 stuffy avengers movies with a bunch of grumpy faced captain america. finally a happy super hero movie. never felt like i related more to a character more in my life. Jaquin Phoenix, always considered the man brilliant. now hes a legend."
3937,"In the last 30-45 minutes pheonix's performance is awesome.Oscar is waiting for you phoenix.
And director played great work in the end by providing the most emotional scene in *DC* (i.e.,Thomas and Martha's death while Bruce is watching) which can stop a person ,who is changing in psychopath by imaging himself as joker (while watching this movie).
And question- *Is there a chance that we can see joker(Joaquin phoenix) in Batman 2021,like in post credits or something?*"
3938,"Best dark thriller suspense movie you will get. This movie is a masterpiece. Phoenix is a true master the art of transforming himself into this character. Definitely a top contender for Oscar.
Bravo!"
3939,"I cannot believe what a great actor Joaquin Phoenix is. From the evil emperor in Gladiator, an odd detective, a guy that falls in love with an operating system and now Arthur Fleck, aka the Joker. Only few actors reach the same height, but none would've played this role so well, not even Heath Ledger. Ledger's performance was legendary, but it takes another skill set to play an origin story.
I cannot help but feel empathy for poor Arthur, who is trying to live by the rules which a society that spits on him have enforced upon him. He actually seeks help, but the system fails him.  I still felt myself rooting for Arthur, I could certainly understand his motivation.
This might be the best film of this decade. I really hope Phoenix reprises this role in a later film. The score, cinematography, acting are all at least 9,5/10. Extremely recommended!"
3940,This is an absolute must watch film for all DC fans
3941,"I heard a lot of people complaining about the fact that this Joker got nothing to do with Batman's Joker that we all know and love. Well, you're missing many points here!1-This movie is supposed to be a non-canon one, meaning it's more of else world story than it's a continuity.
2-The movie is made to tell the story of how society can drive a man into madness and they nailed it.
3-Up till this very moment, The Joker never had an origin story. In the comics you gonna have the vet accident, the failing comedian, the three jokers, the lazuras pit joker, etc. So why all the madness about a story that suggest a different background and taking a page from the comics as well while they do it resulting in the most believable and humane story ever!
4-The acting was great, the movie was meh! Seriously guys you're missing it all over again, if you think the acting is solid then the movie is solid cause this is a one man show, it tells the story from Arthur's perspective.Pay a good second watch to the movie and enjoy a masterpiece that we'll have to wait a while till we learn how to praise it."
3942,"For me I call tell, this movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my entire life in term of acting, sound effects, story,..... despite of having very dark depressing moments in this movie, you still sense the feeling of greatness after finish watching the movie.
First time ever to watch a realistic comic movie which made him a one of a kind.
The problem is this movie might encourage some evil things in our real world to whose see themselves in this movie in a way or another, the fact that the moments and situations you experienced in the joker might happened to you through your life, how many times you got a depressing situations where someone enjoys making fun of you or mocking your life, character, origin, religion, skin color. Ideology or even just bullying you in school. Let's think about that. Hurting someone's feeling is funny it can destroys everything"
3943,"This is as unique of a film as you'll ever see. I've never been in an awe of an acting performance as I am of Joaquin... this is a masterful performance and an absolute masterpiece of a film. The critics who gave it bad reviews need to go back and rewatch this film...no idea what some of these critics were thinking. Wildly entertaining, powerful and captivating."
3944,"To say Joaquin Phoenix's performance in this film is incredible is an gross understatement. His portrayal of Arthur Fleck a/k/a Joker is fearless, gut wrenching and astounding. I would say without question one of the greatest acting performances I've ever seen.The film is a testament to what creativity and raw talent can offer as new and previously undone at a time where so much of what we see is regurgitated dreck.Rather then give a synopsis of the film as most reviewers have I will just say that ""Joker"" is everything it is hyped up to be. The film starts out a bit slow but the payoff is brilliant and worth the price of admission.Go see this film if you want to be entertained with a phenomenal story, tremendous direction and one of the greatest performances by a lead actor you will ever see! It's that good!"
3945,"I left the theater speechless. This is a perfect movie, I dare to say this is one of the best films of the decade. This is not another empty superhero movie, this is art and elegance.It MUST win an Oscar, at least for Joaquin Phoenix. Otherwise, I'll never believe im those awards again."
3946,"Fantastic movie, Joaquin is the Joker to the tee. It's an emotional ride that makes you feel sorry for him and relate to people with metal illnesses etc.I salute the Director/writers for this and Joaquin should walk out with all the Oscars.I would love them to bring him into the next Batman movie!"
3947,"Seriously.
Just go see it.
If you wanna feel something.
Just go see it.
If you feel like there's no more great movies.
Just go see it.If you thought dark night was dark.
Just go see it.Seriously.
Just go see it."
3948,"My goodness me, he is such a brilliant actor. This film had me gripped from beginning to end. Clearly a man with huge mental health issues, a really complex character. The laugh.. what can I say, go see you won't be disappointed."
3949,The only risk for society is that you don't go and watch the Joker
3950,"Joker is a movie that demands to be seen more than once. It is gruesome, strange, shocking, and amazing. Joaquin Phoenix is amazing as Arthur Fleck/ the joker, and he definitely deserves an Oscar for this performance. Robert De Niro has a great performance, although he has very little screen time. The visuals in this movie are one of the best parts. Every shot looks like a beautifully crafted photo. The score is also amazing (I'm not going to spoil anything, but there is one part that genuinely gave me goosebumps because of the score). The soundtrack is okay, and while it is fine, it feels a little manipulative at one point. The script is... okay. The dialogue is fine, but it feels like what is happening and the sequence of events is only okay, and feels overtly obvious at parts (you'll see what I mean)."
3951,"Joker will go down as a classic. Doesn't feel like a comic movie at all which is great. A few iconic scenes in this film, brilliantly done. The final 20 minutes is well worth the wait. Joaquin Phoenix is incredible. 10/10"
3952,"It is very rare that a film can have a long lasting affect on you, well this is that rare occurrence! I have seen this twice now and it has had a long lasting affect.The film depicts the struggle of a man who's suffered child hood trauma, mental health issues and isolation, this is what Society chooses to ignore not just relevant in Gotham but today's modern society.Jaoquins performance blew me away and surely will win an Oscar. He made the audience feel each seen and the tension and emotion was palpable. The excellent music composer helps to add a further layer of suspense alongside the cinematography which was dark and dull to match the mood.Not only do I recommend as this will be etched into cinematic greatness but I feel it's a great thought provoking movie.In my opinion he bettered heaths joker performance but it's definitely alongside it. The ending in which the bravado of the joker comes out, the mood changes to one of happiness when he feels noticed and accepted by society."
3953,That is all I could start with Joaquin is a wonderful joker and should stay the joker in any future movies that would have to star a joker hands down he's now my number 1 favorite joker I'm sorry and R.I.P always Heath ledger is my second my third is now Jared leto and so on I was upset when I first found out about them making the joker movie without jared leto and Margot Robbie they should make one with them two again they did were wonderful together but this blows all the other ones OUT OF THE WATER!!! Joaquin bravo and what a awesome job you did stan lee would have been proud I hope it had a small amount of violence which my husband loved but made me sick thats just not my style but I still give it two thumbs up and and million praises i want to make sure everyone watches this damn good film fantastic job everyone who was involved 🤡
3954,Buzz created by joker before the release is extraordinary. From trailer it's obvious that Joaquin phoenix did a Oscar worthy performance. And in trailers they haven't given away much. I was unsure whether it will reach my expectations. But this film crosses my expectations. Nothing extravagant or mind blowing. But the way the director told the simple story combined with extra ordinary acting and cinematography is simply superb. Go watch it in cinemas if you haven't watched already.... :)
3955,"For those that are experiencing severe ennui in the age of conveyor-belt blockbuster monstrosities, Joker is a breath of fresh air. Not only does it totally subvert expectations in it's own genre (the film is extremely small scale and barely relies on any superhero/comic book tropes) but it manages to be an excellent film noir/ character study/ hilarious dark comedy in it's own right.Joker has all the hallmarks of the film's it's emulating, but through the lens of a comic book antihero origin story and with Todd Phillip's direction brilliantly balancing callousness and tenderness, it becomes unlike anything you've seen before. Of course, it harkens back to the films of Martin Scorsese in a way that borders on problematic. Plot wise, Joker feels like an odd fusion of The King of Comedy (pathetic loner aspires to be stand up comedian and ultimately takes on his talk show host hero to achieve fame) and Taxi Driver (sociopathic, mentally ill man lives alone in an atrophied society that ultimately leads him to commit freeing acts of violence), but ultimately it overcomes it's inspirations to become it's own film.All in all, I think this is definitely worth a watch. I wish Hollywood would make more films like this."
3956,"But that doesn't mean it's not a good movie. I went in knowing it wasn't about Batman and anything D.C. but I didn't think it was this deep and dark.Phoenix better get some awards for this movie. He truly portrayed a man with serious mental illness and the effort he took to lose that weight definitely enhanced his role.It's a drama. It's not exciting and suspenseful. Again, if you're expecting bullet proof bats or good vs. evil, you got the wrong idea. Great movie though."
3957,"What is there to say about this movie that hasn't already been said? Joker is a meticulous, expertly crafted piece of art, in terms of writing, direction, cinematography, and especially performance. Every element of this film is a solid piece of the framework and each lends their strengths to each other in a way that hasn't been seen in a comic book movie before.From Pheonix's heart-wrenching, mesmerizing, and terrifying performance, to the tension building, tragic score, to the harsh depth of field that leaves the viewer in a dream-land, as if everything in the world is an illusion. There isn't a single element of Joker that isn't filled with passion and careful consideration. A week after seeing it and I've done nothing but think about each element more and more - it's a story that begs for repeat viewings, filled to the brim with detail, leaving space for theorizing and conspiring, the perfect way to do a Joker origin movie:""If I'm going to have a past, I'd rather it be multiple choice""The only slight downfalls of this near masterpiece is that in some parts it can feel a little repetitive, and it does heavily borrow from Scorcese films such as Taxi Driver & King of Comedy, but ultimately these are minor nitpicks in an unforgettable, unsettling, and thought-provoking narrative that will continue to be discussed and theorised for years.Filled with quotables, memorable moments, shocking moments, shocking moments with hints of Joker comedy, this is definitely the perfect Joker origin story, as well as an important message/warning to society regarding the 1%."
3958,"An intense buildup of a mentally broken character, slowly mutating, from the environment that surrounds him and from himself, into the world's famous Joker. This movie is not for everyone, its a carefully crafted piece of art both shocking and slow to unveil, which many may not like. However, these two parts really make the movie. The slowness gives you an appreciation for the impeccable and subtle characterization by Joaquin and connects you in a better way to the pain and suffering of Arthur, the character. Its shocking nature allows for a constant back and forth between sympathizing with his struggles and repulsing his actions, while at the same time, understanding the stance he ultimately finds himself in. Everything pieced together with great music, sound, ambient, and acting. Special congratulations to Joaquin Phoenix who steals the show, as it should be. He created a very intriguing character that while connected with the Joker persona, doesn't resemble any of the character's previous interpretations, therefore making this his unique and personal take."
3959,"The character grows beautifully and the acting skills were perfection, I know you probably seen some reviews criticising the violence but this movie shows that when you don't recognise mental health problems and on top you get bullied on a daily basis then it can only lead to two things.. one you end up dead through suicide or you become suicidal and others end up dead.
It's a masterpiece that you cannot miss"
3960,A triumph for cinema. Todd Phillips has created an exceptional film.
3961,Perfect representation of mental health spiralling
3962,"Every portrayal of the Joker is unique and this one is no exception. This 122 minute dive into the mental state of one of, if not THE most iconic DC villain is spectacular to say the least. Arthur Fleck is a down on his luck clown for hire, living with his mother in Gotham, but as Joker said himself in The Killing Joke, it only takes one BAD day to bring someone down to his level of insanity, and this is our ticket to see what it was.Is there violence?
Is it disturbing?
If you're asking these questions you don't know Joker. Yes, and this is par for the course.Is this meant to justify Joker's actions?
No, it's meant to show you how we got to where he is now.Is this supposed to make us sympathize with him?
Do that at your own peril, Harley did that and look what happened to her."
3963,"It's been 12 hours since I saw Joker at my local cinema and my head is still spinning.
I didn't get much sleep and I'm still trying to process what happened.
It was nothing short of a feast for the senses and I just wanted more.Make no mistake - this is cinematic brilliance at its highest level.
A masterpiece.
Hauntingly beautiful, magnificent, mesmerizing.
Stunning.
Chilling.
I honestly don't think I blinked during the two hours in fear of missing something.The onscreen world immediately captures you and pulls you in to an 80's Gotham City.
The thunderous Dolby Atmos soundtrack is beautiful, chilling and at times downright terrifying.If you are expecting a non-stop gore fest then you will be bitterly disappointed.
There are a handful of shootings.
What you will experience is a classic film of unprecedented genius, both artistically and technically.I must admit I went into the theatre with a bias towards Joaquin Phoenix.
Everyone has read the stories of his whacky antics and frequent meltdowns.
I'd seen his on set rant on talk show Jimmy Kimmel a few weeks back and thought him to be just another pretentious actor.
All is forgiven.
His performance in this film is truly breathtaking.Joker is not just another DC superhero film, it's a journey into the mind of a twisted psychopath who needed help but didn't get it.
For some reason, actors who have previously played this character (Nicholson, Ledger, Leto, Romero, etc.) have all turned in both sterling and mesmerizing performances.
But it's Phoenix who now wears the crown as The Clown Prince Of Crime.
Here is my rather modest prediction come Oscar season.Best picture.
Best screenplay.
Best director.
Best cinematography.
Best actor in a leading role.
Best musical score.
Best sound editing.What I'm trying to say is this is undoubtably the best piece of modern cinema I have ever seen.P.S. For those uneasy about Gary Glitter coining in the royalties for his track in the film, his catalogue was bought out years ago by a UK based publishing company so he will not be receiving a dime for the tracks inclusion."
3964,One of the best movies from DC after a long time. Really enjoyed it a lot
3965,"Outstanding, chilling and haunting movie.
Joaquin Phoenix with an Oscar winning performance. The Joker has its heated moments of sheer excellence constantly leaving you on the edge of your seat. This film will leave your head scrambled, thinking of lots of what ifs. This is why the movie is so good; Making you decide its ending. A masterpiece."
3966,"Joker needs an Oscar, absolutely brilliant movie!!"
3967,"Joaquin Phoenix is amazing, the way the movie is made is wow, everything about it it's strange and it keeps you to your seat. Thank you for the show, gents. I've witnessed the best movie of the year."
3968,"JOKER is a classy, demented spotlight on an over saturated character that has the story telling ability of a gritty 90's thriller with the Oscar award winning polish of a Scorsese bio picture. It made you connect with the human inside the monster and then made you hate yourself for doing so.5🍻"
3969,"Just like millions around the world, I was on my toes for the Joker to come out and indulge us with some extraordinary performance. Fact of the matter, we witnessed a little more than we signed up for. Joaquin phoenix delivered a new standard for acting, embracing a complex dramatic ascension of the Joker character throughout the movie, shedding focus on the horrendous truth of the society we live in. The tragedy was so intense I couldn't hold my tears in some scenes, but as the Joker said ""I used to think my life was a tragedy, but now I realize it's a comedy""."
3970,"Thoughts of Travis Bickle came into my head on viewing this movie. The dissension into violence and detachment from society oozed into the dark corners of this movie.This is a movie of today. The lack of social services for Arthur's Mother Penny has come back to haunt the city of Gotham. There are few movie out there that you can say you'd love to see again and pick up on all the little ""breadcrumb "" left for us to follow. I'm buzzing writing this review because those of us who saw the movie will be speaking of it in days/weeks to come and those of us who haven't will just have to read so much about it. Please go out and see this movie it make us think of what society neglect will come back to us in spades. ""Joker"" is a social commentary of our lack of treatment of the mentally ill. ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest and ""Taxi Driver "" have a new roommate."
3971,"Joker is unlike any previous DC film, with Todd Phillips forming a more political and psychological take on one of cinema's favourite villains. Joaquin Phoenix, who appeared in the Sisters Brother earlier this year, plays Arthur Fleck, a failed comedian working as a clown in Gotham City, where tensions increase day by day. Fleck wears two masks: one is his clown make-up, and one is his 'happy face', which, along with his uncontrollable manic laughter, hides the reality of his dark and deteriorating mental state. Phoenix proves the perfect choice of actor, and arguably suits this style of Joker better than any previous actors would have. This is because the Joker in this film is not so much a villain as he is a victim - very different (but not superior) to the character played by the late Heath Ledger. The way Joaquin is able to contort his face and body, as well as displaying multiple contrasting emotions at one, means his character is deeply complex and utterly disturbing. Not a huge fan of DC and action movies in general, I was originally apprehensive about seeing Joker, but it completely defied my expectations. Instead, the events are frighteningly believable, and the film is really a delve into mental illness, exposing faults in Americas' support systems for society's most vulnerable. However, for those expecting the usual explosive action of previous DC films, this one may prove a disappointment. For most though, it has been received as a cinematic work of art. Despite having been blown away by other films this year, this is definitely the best thing I've watched in a long time, and it will prove a shock if Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar for best actor. It's something I'd recommend everyone watch as it's a very accurate depiction of mental illness, and though it left me feeling rather uncomfortable, its message is a powerful and important one, especially in our current time."
3972,"All I can say is that I never felt so much sympathy for a villain like the Joker in this movie because beside all the evil which awakes more and more in him he is a victim in the end. His life started under the worst circumstances but the final burning mark is given by a ruthless, exploiting society where your social background determines the rest of your life.Acting is superb. Joaquin Phoenix found his destiny in this role.After watching this movie I saw an imaginary line in the end credits ""This movie is dedicated to all the lost and tortured souls out there"". I feel like there is a part of this villain within me. I finally managed to control my inner demons so I could escape a dark future. Arthur Fleck failed in a sad but not surprising way."
3973,"I didn't expect too much from this movie! How wrong I was! What an awesome acting! And I think it's the best Joker, with all respect for Heath Ledger! Joaquin deserves Oscar for this role!"
3974,"One of the best movies I have watched in a long long time. Reflecting todays world, full of selfishness. Joaquin is amazing! Oscar is waiting for this movie!"
3975,"I've never felt compelled enough to write a review about a movie before but this film has made me feel the need to do so.The setting for this film was just perfect and I was engrossed from minute one. Phoenix portrayal of the ""Joker"" was just sublime, he deserves every last bit of credit for bringing this character to life once again on the big screen.Having said that I feel that it's not all about Phoenix but the supporting cast all have such a big part to play in the development of The jokers character.I think it is an Oscar worthy film with Oscar worthy performances. The picture, the score, the acting are all beyond amazing!"
3976,What a movie.....the joker he deserves the Oscar for the great acting...
3977,"This movie is a story of mentally ill person being pushed out of society, abused by people around him and broken by people he idolize.
This isn't a some fictional story filled with CGI, and to some this isn't even a fictional story. There are lots of people who are treated just like Joker. They suffer in silence, their existence is treated as nuisance, their calls for help are called ""toxic"" or ""privileged"". Society so happily mistreat people, but then act in shock and horror when those people break.
Joker is a movie about pain and irony of the world. It shows how society treat those who are different and how it repays those who have dreams. This movie forces abusers to see the life of their victims, it shows the consequences of careless evil. That is why abusers and generally evil people can't stand this movie - because it shows them who the true villain is. Joker isn't the villain of this movie. He does lots of horrid things, the character should rot in jail for his actions, but shouldn't the people who made him suffer the same fate? Joker is a product of torture, so he lashes out against his torturers. Nothing more.By the way, it also have great comedic moments, but as Joker says himself: ""Humor is subjective""."
3978,"The movie was exceptional. It covered all 3 things a good film should. It was surprising, kept the viewer thinking and guessing, and had a sensational main character. The Joker, even though a major villain and a mentally ill criminal, was somehow relatable. Fantastic piece of work!"
3979,"Movie of the year.
Joaquin Phoenix performance was amazing and he definitely deserve the oscar."
3980,I can watch this movie million of times without getting bored.
3981,"Mind-blowing masterpiece! What a performance... Pure art in movie theatre. I'm speachless!!! I'll definitely go and watch again. Brilliantly performed!
We all have been alone at some point of time in life, think about those who've been nobody forever.
Brilliant - one word.
MASTERPIECE 🤡"
3982,What a good movie my second best movie of DC movies my first one is the dark knight
3983,Anyone likes batman anymore.. Joker destroyed all the ideas about him and his acts
3984,"An amazing movie, amazing story. All thanks to the incredible actors, the magnificent crews and the marvelous director!"
3985,"Three words: believe the hype
Brilliantly and beautifully told, absolute haunting masterpiece."
3986,After long time I saw a performance which actually hit your mind directly and tells you what is the feeling of a person if society doesn't recognize him.
3987,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Joker. I liked how it truly showed Arthur Fleck going more and more insane throughout the film. A good example would be him imagining that his next door neighbor is his girlfriend, only to find out later in the film that it was all in his head. Joaquin Phoenix was also amazing in this film and he completely owned the role of the joker.The only criticism that I have with this film is that it feels like a newly done Taxi Driver and The King Of Comedy crossover. I believe that director of The Hangover, Todd Phillips really enjoys that era of Scorsese. Fair enough, Taxi Driver is an amazing movie and it inspires me. That doesnt mean I am going to make a movie that is almost a copy of Taxi Driver, with only some sequences and characters changed.Although I have this gripe with the movie, I still really enjoyed it and I thought the sets, cinematography and Joaquin Phoenix were amazing in this. I would recommend seeing this."
3988,"Yes. Just saying film is a masterpiece is an understatement and Joaquin & Todd deserves better. The Dark Knight was a masterpiece, but Joker not only beat my expectations, it gives me real hope that going forward we can have real movies"
3989,"Joker is a different type of movie, finally something original. The actor was superb.
I believe the movie should be called Arthur, but Joker simply sells more."
3990,"This take on the joker is fresh and new. Taking a man rittled with mental illnesses and putting him into a broken Gotham City. This takes the joker to a different level... Slowly taking Arthur Fleck and driving him more and more insane, until the city, ""gets what it deserves""Joaquin Phoenix is extraordinary... You believe he has these real conditions and you feel so bad for him in the stressful situations that he is put into due to his pathological laughing disorder.While watching the film it was hard to watch in a good way. You didn't want to look away as Arthur was slowly driven insane from getting treated like trash and finding his mother lied to him his whole life.People who enjoy Batman's nemesis ""the joker"" character from the comics will also enjoy this movie. They tie in Bruce Wayne into this without going over the top with it. People who like just plain out good movies that don't feel like they are plastered with superheroes everywhere will also enjoy this movie.Recommend seeing this."
3991,"I guess thats about it, the title of my review. Thats why I understand when people google *is Joker movie disturbing?* . Tod Philips managed to make us feel like the other guy, a mentally ill guy who was thrown into the society. Felt that all the time up to the end when all became Joker and all understood whats it like to feel like the other guy."
3992,I just watched the movie and it was amazing.The actor performance of Phoenix is so gripping and real its insane.You see the pictures and you think you can feel his pain.Its so gritty. Feels a lot like Nolans Batman Trilogy.Sure the movie was not 100 percent perfect but the performance of phoenix...There is no other way then just to give 10/10.He was that good!Just go in and enjoy this movie.
3993,"Give Joaquin Phoenix the Oscar right now. His bravura performance as the titular character in JOKER is one for the ages. He is on the screen in every scene of this film and captivates and repulses you at the same time. This performance raises this film to another level.The question is - what level was this film at, and where does this performance raise it to?Set in Gotham City right around the time of the murder of Bruce Wayne's parents, JOKER tells the origin story of...well...a character that calls himself JOKER. This sad sack, with the name of Arthur Fleck, is a part-time clown (standing outside of store closings with a spinning sign or going to Children's Hospital). We watch his origins as he rises (or perhaps...falls?) to the anarchic symbol that is JOKER. And that's the interesting thing about this film. You are watching the fall of a man and the rise of a symbol - does Fleck find comfort or madness in this journey - or, perhaps, maybe he finds comfort in madness?Embodying this broken spirit that keeps getting up despite whatever beatings (sometimes physical, sometimes mental, always with the potential to finally break him) is the unique talent that is Joaquin Phoenix. You can tell from his portrayal of Arthur that there is something just ""off"" with him and you continually wait for the breaking point that will drive him down the road of JOKER. But it is not only his acting that is on display here, it the manipulation and movements of his body that is amazing and outstanding. Much like a professional dancer, Phoenix/Fleck waltzes through this film like there is a musical score that only he can hear - and that is both fascinating and disturbing at the same time. There is a fine line that needs to be trod here, for if you don't, this character and performance can easily be one of total madness (a.k.a. Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance in the SHINING) but Phoenix balances sanity/insanity very well and you are waiting for the final blow that will send him, inevitably, over the edge. It's like watching a ticking time bomb that you cannot see the clock counting down to zero - but count down to zero you are sure it will do.Exchanging blows with Phoenix for about 1/3 of this film is Robert DeNiro as talk show host Murray Franklin (think a meaner version of Johnny Carson). DeNiro is VERY good in this role and it is good to see that he still can ""bring it"" as a serious actor when he wants to. Unfortunately, DeNiro's character isn't really in the first 2/3 of this film and that's too bad. Phoenix' Arthur Fleck is a force to be reckoned with and he really could have used another character just as strong to play against.Unfortunately, Writer/Director Todd Phillips (THE HANGOVER films) doesn't really give Phoenix anyone strong to play against for the first 2/3 of this film though Frances Conroy (overbearing mother), Zazie Beetz (potential love interest) and Brett Cullen (billionaire Thomas Wayne, father of Bruce) come and go in all too brief appearances that never really are on screen long enough to stand their ground (though Conroy comes close). This makes the first part of this film very on-sided, dreary, depressing and dark. I get that Director/Writer Phillips was going for the ""Decaying of Gotham"" theme as seen through the eyes of Fleck, but it became a slog after awhile. I wanted to yell at the screen at about the 1 hour mark ""All right, I get it!""Now...to give Phillips credit, he creates an interesting version of this world that we all know well (through the Dark Knight and various other DC Universe films), so I give him points for originality. And...he really NAILS the ending (the last 1/3 of the film - the part WITH DeNiro). I thought it was effective and potent and left it's mark.Which brings me back to my opening thought. Phoenix raises this film up with his performance - the question is ""from where to where"". I'd have to say (because of the slowness of the first 2/3 of this film) that Phoenix fearless performance raises this dark and dreary film from a ""C"" to a ""B"". So with that in mind, I give JOKER...Letter Grade: B7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
3994,"Liberal media can cry about todd philips all they want but to let that get in the way of properly critiquing this masterpiece is just a joke.
This is a must see for anyone slightly interested in fantastic acting delving into the darkness of the human condition. To judge this movie and not see it based on a liberal critic with a left wing agenda is the biggest joke of all."
3995,"I loved every second of this film, and I really hope we get to see Joaquin return as Arthur Fleck 🙌"
3996,"It was absolutely a masterclass. Best movie of the year and a must deserve an oscar. Joaquin Phoenix has done full justice to the character Joker, sometimes I thought Heath Ledger himself was there."
3997,"Joaquin Phoenix
Great acting
Great cinematography
Great music
Perfection exists"
3998,"Oscar level performance by Joaquin Phoenix , the portrayal of joker is so go just go and watch it i dont wanna spoil this gem for you guys"
3999,"One of the best movies ive seen in a while
Juaqin carried this movie literally on his back"
4000,"JOKER is a dark, depressing, moody, violent masterpiece. The film rest upon the shoulders of Joaquin Phoenix and he pulls it off brilliantly! The entire cast is awesome especially De Niro and Zazie Beetz.It's hard to believe the guy who directed The Hangover trilogy and Road Trip is the same guy who directed this punch in the gut brilliant flawless slow burn gritty glorious film.There is no Batman to battle or evil supervillain to play off of. This is the story of one man's journey into darkness and that is why Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is easily the best Joker that has ever graced the big screen in my opinion.Will Phoenix win the oscar? Probably not. I can't see that spineless (Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences) politically correct tool of an organization giving out any major awards to a film this good.Joker is the best movie I've watched in the past 10 years. The flick gets 10 out of 10 severed thumbs.If you didn't already know the story centers around Arthur Fleck a mentally troubled comedian as he embarks on a downward spiral of social revolution and bloody crime. It is his story, it is the world as he sees it."
4001,"One of the best tragedy, loved the acting of Phoenix!"
4002,"This movie was so good, his performance was outstanding. It shows a lot of situations that are relevant in this world today and I won't spoil it for those who read this, but I really think he deserves to win an Oscar for this one, it is the best movie I've seen in a long time."
4003,I went 3 times :D so beatiful film crazy and emotion...
4004,"Woooow! This is Movie Nice & Best Cinema...
Joackin Best Actor In Year 2019"
4005,La performance de Joaquin Phoenix est hallucinante. Direction l'Oscar !!
4006,Outstanding performance by Joaquin phoenix ... Thnx Phillips for giving this wonderful movie ..
4007,"This movie is a must see. It creates an intricate web using the mental illness of Joaquin Phoenix's Joker, to twist you into a story and lock you in a world where you feel sorry for someone most Batman fans have despised their entire lives. The acting and score create a brilliant emphasis on suspense and draws you into the movie to feel the struggle of the Joker as you begin to understand how he came to be.I believe this movie should be eye opening to everyone on how mental illness is treated within society. It does portray violence to an extreme, but it also points out the obvious holes within our society surrounding mental illness. To quote from the movie, ""The worst part about having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you DON'T.""Joaquin Phoenix does over shadow the remaining actors in this movie. His performance does not allow for space for anyone else to shine in their roles, and it shows in how they acted.End of it all, this movie is deserved of the praise it has received"
4008,The Joker movie starts with really slow pacing and shows in the beginning how Arthur becomes the Joker. When he really goes crazy and murders some people the pacing gets higher and the Joker has arrived. One of the best scenes for me was when he talks about the society and shooting Frank Murray and how the city is going to chaos.
4009,"The Joker movie started with really slow with pacing. In the beginning It shows how he evolves and will turn into the Joker. When it goes with fast pace the movie will turn out to be really busy and weird, but I dig it."
4010,"This is a must watch multiple times!! The best acting performances, directing and story writing."
4011,"Deeply disturbing and real. JOAQUIN deserves the Oscar. But will the politically correct Oscar's panel award him the honor?
Stay Tuned on the next episode of Dragon Ball Z....."
4012,"Regardless of anything we should all start with the huge performance of Joaquin Phoenix !! That performance was beyond great , i loved the movie so much , it touches you , it will make you remember every time you hurt someone or someone hurt you , you will just remember it while watching the movie , it gives us a lesson that is really important ! Just be nice to each other people ... loved it , 10/10"
4013,"The best DC movie since MOS in 2013, this move really shows how unique D.C. Is to its style."
4014,A MASTERPIECE!! Best movie in the last years! I love how the Joker story was approached!!
4015,Its not about joker its about arther flk ther is no joker only in last 15 minute in the move you can see Arther transforming to joker
4016,"This film was close to perfect. The character arch was phenomenal and Joaquin's performance was excellent throughout the film, with his odd ticks and the way he used his body to show emotion that the character couldn't articulate. You could see his journey to becoming the Joker so clearly and everything made sense and clicked the moment you were shown it on screen. One after another you started to see the peices build until the Joker was complete. This unique story of following a troubled man's decent into one of the most famous villain of all time is well worth a watch.Congrats to everyone involved in this masterpiece."
4017,"This movie had wonderful storytelling, beautiful camera work, amazing direction, great acting, phenomenal product. It shows us the reality up close and personal. People who are leaving negative reviews are mostly incapable to make a masterpiece like this and/or are Marvel fanboys. Don't get me wrong I like Marvel too but when it comes to the joker or Batman we put aside our differences. Great watch, money worth."
4018,"This movie was a bit different from what I had expected yo see, in that, for a movie about a joker there are very few jokes, and very little humor. It is still very worth seeing, though. It does address the very real and pressing issue of income inequality, and the feelings of isolation and futility that many people feel today. These are really the most moving scenes of the movie, and the ones that really cast Arthur in the role of the every man we can all relate to. The way that he becomes an icon to all of his ""clown"" admirers, especially toward the end of the movie, was the most uplifting part of the movie. The fact that there is a scene that is very similair to the one shown in the original 1989 Batman film makes this film both a Batman and Joker origin story. The back ground music, cinematography, screenplay, and nost of all the acting by Mr Phoenix, and Mr. DeNiro a must see for all adult fans of the batman super hero genre."
4019,"This is a must see if you love drama and psychological thrillers. I can't even find the words to describe it. I don't usually feel strongly about movies but this one just struck a cord with me. The hype is real. If Joaquin Pheonix doesn't win ALL the awards for this movie.... you know the game is rigged. ABSOLUTELY STUNNING. The film doesn't encourage violence, it encourages the exact opposite; human kindness. Something so simple could have changed the entire course of Arthur Fleck's life. Don't believe what the negative liberal media has to say about this. Watch and see for yourself that Joker is an absolute MASTERPIECE."
4020,"Going into this Movie, I honestly just couldn't wait. Obviously for the fact the the Joker is my Favorite comic book Villain, but also knowing Phoenix, the most underrated actor in Hollywood, would play the Clown Prince of Crime.My excitement after watching the movie became shocked, my expectations were excited...Phoenix did it, he entered the Ledger Conversation.The movie focuses on Arthur(Joker) on all aspects of the movie. It details on how a person, who has just had enough of being a laughing stock from society, mentally disturbed, creates his own persona.The powerful Scenes this movie has, from The first kills, Joker touching Young Bruce Wayne's(Batman) face, other killings, and finally, becoming the agent of Chaos, and it's all from the Masterful Phoenix.Well done Joaquin, Heath would be Smiling and Laughing from the Craft."
4021,"Words can't describe how great this film is. It is one of those films you have to watch for yourself and is a breath of fresh air from your usual summer blockbuster superhero and action movies. There are a lot of deep, underlying themes and messages in this movie, and might require multiple viewings to fully understand this kind of film which plays a lot like a psychological drama/thriller. Please go and watch this if you haven't already. You won't be disappointed!"
4022,It's fair to say that was one of the best acting perfomances of the history. A unique experience is provided for movie lovers. Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar. No. The Oscar needs Joaquin Phoenix after this movie!
4023,"Joaquin Phoenix's performance alone deserves the 9 rating. Everything this movie has to say is incredible, whether or not it's in a good or bad connotation is left to the viewer, but incredible nonetheless. Even if watched just for the Joker origin story, it still delivers amazingly from an entire production."
4024,"SUCK IT MARVEL, better than Endgame ( CHUPA MARVEL)"
4025,Outstanding movie with a haunting performance and best character development ever seen.
4026,"This movie is an absolute masterpiece. It left me wondering about everything happening in my life, it makes you think about things.While some people say it 'emphasises on violence' and how it can 'activate people to become violent' , I believe that this movie is doing the opposite: showing that we have to respect everybody in society. The joker wouldn't have existed if there was nobody who rejected him.It's a beautiful message. Just go and watch it. For me it's the best movie I've ever seen"
4027,"This movie is literally a beauty. Made well. Every shot is like art. Very fine attention to detail. Hard to pick anything bad with this film. And I've left out the best part, the acting. Joaquin does a fantastic job. You aren't seeing him, you are seeing Arthur fleck. He portrays a man with a mental illness so well it's scary. This is the best dc film since the dark knight and I really hope folks give it a chance. The violence is very earned and so is the subtle quiet moments. Never gets boring or slow. Pacing is excellent. Please see this film"
4028,"This is not your average super-villain movie. I also get why people don't like it. People don't want to sympathize with a deranged killer suffering from mental illness, but if it made you uncomfortable than the movie did its job wonderfully. Phoenix delivered in my opinion an oscar winning performance. I hope there is a sequel!"
4029,"I attended a late night showing last night and let me just say, you could here a pen drop in the theater when the credits rolled. (In a good way)
So many people right now are trying to find some political message in this, there isn't one. It's an intense character study about a troubled individual. Don't be afraid of the news, go watch for yourself."
4030,This movie is a masterpiece!!! I do not have words to describe Phoenix's acting! He deserves 1000 oscars for this.
4031,It definitely was. Haven't seen a film this good in cinema ever. Great to see such a character build.
4032,"You won't actually be putting on a happy face while watching Joker, what you'll be doing instead is witness the greatest film of the year and the Oscar-worthy performance of Joaquin Phoenix. His performance is extraordinary, every single time you hear him laugh, you know something is wrong and you start to feel uncomfortable, add all that to his facial expressions and acting skills and you've got yourself a perfect performance that will be talked about for years to come. What this movie does to its viewers is fantastic, you're on the edge of your seat through all of its runtime which is about 2 hours. Joker is full of shocking scenes and so many surprises and it utilizes its R-rating very well. As we know this movie talks about mental illness and what it does to people and how it affects them specially when those people get abused or be made fun of, and Joker portrays this so perfectly that you even tend to sympathize with the main character, not that he is a good guy, he's not, he's the Joker after all, but by the way of how they portrayed this, you will be able to relate to this character and understand what he's going through so that by the time his story comes full circle and you see his character evolve to the clown prince of crime we all love to hate and hate to love, you'll be very satisfied and upset at the same time by how he becomes the Joker and it's all in a good way. Joker has quite the Easter eggs and references to other movies like the King of Comedy and Taxi Driver as the director Todd Phillips said that those two movies inspired him to do Joker, so you'll definitely feel some elements of those movies in here too. Talking about this movie without spoiling it is so difficult, but all i'll say is this: Joker is a drama masterpiece and it's not like any other comic book movie that's been made before, this is an original story that is based on the character ""Joker"" from DC comics but with a new and a deep origin story that is basically a character study that'll leave you wondering and thinking about how devastating it is by the time the credits start rolling.Verdict: Joker is one of those movies that after viewing, you will need to sit down and try to take it all in because it dives deep into what mental illness is and how it can affect people and how society can be a part of that transformation."
4033,"I was smiling when I finished this movie. Wow, it's been long time I never watch very complex development character in the movie. No CGI bull*** to throw around, no unnecessary explosions, it's just human story. It touched my heart. Joaquin Phoenix gave tour de force performance. Bravo!!"
4034,"This is one of the best movies I ever seen. I would never have guessed Todd Philips would be able to pull off something like this. The pace is perfect for a movie who aims to introduce a new character into the universe. And what a character, so different from Nolan's Joker but so perfect and original. Joaquin Phoenix delivers an outstanding performance, probably his best."
4035,I wanna watching this movie all day I love this comics joker so evils I like it
4036,"One of the best performance i ever saw!
The Greatest JoKer of all time.
Well done Joaquin well done."
4037,"Acting, Directing, cinematography, Action and comedy etc those film had everything perfect I found the jokes funny because I am the joker watch it enjoy"
4038,"Absolute masterpiece of a film, best piece of acting ever by Jaoquin Phoenix who is sensational, I want to watch that film over and over again"
4039,"It is an awesome movie indeed. Orchestra, fotography, cinematography, Joaquin Phoenix did his best role performance ever. He is in it, and you will be consumed by this movie. Deserves every oscar! Movie of the year!"
4040,"Best movie I have ever seen!! I can't get my eyes off the screen for the entire movie. It's hitting your heart in every direction possible. Go see it, don't miss it!"
4041,What most people don't understand is that a social problem is dealt with here is wonderful how this is filmed and how the joker is played this is more like class! I looked at it with full praise. I have never left a comment in the years that I am a member and active here but this was worth it.
4042,"From the beginning to the very end i was hooked, u almost feel his pain behind every laugh, and probably would end up cheering for him if i was in gotham city .. amazing performance by phoenix, very well done"
4043,"A great view and realistic approach of the creation of the joker. I was one who didnt think anyone could be the joker after Heath, but Pheonix did an amazing job!"
4044,"I was skeptical at first about this movie when I first heard that they were going to be producing a solo Joker film. But after viewing the trailer numerous times, I realized this could be one of those hit or miss films. This film for me was a hit, everything from the acting to the cinematography. It is truly a cinematic masterpiece, and is a fine representation of why the film industry in America is known as the best. Joaquin Phoenix did a phenomenal job as the joker. Truly a gut wrenching performance, which could be argued by many as a Oscar worthy performance. Truly this film is one of the greatest films produced in 2019."
4045,Best freaking Joker ever Heath Ledger did a great acting in dark night but this is something beyond I am sure you who haven watched it yet must thinking it would be a dry movie with good acting but its an aewsto carry on for 2 hours but the way omg its a must watch Jack Phonics
4046,"This movie gave me all sorts of feelings, unbelievably good written! , acting , sound effects , story everything was sooo good. For everyone: you have to see it."
4047,This film Was epic fromnStart to finish. Everyone nerds to watch this. Don't listen to what any of the fake news reports day or the reviewers say.
4048,"10/10 Joaquin Phoenix is outstanding best portrayal of the joker I've seen, I never thought heath ledger's portrayal would be beat but I was proved wrong by a mile. Dark thrilling edge of your seat type movie, take a bow Joaquin"
4049,Great prequel to the Batman universe - putting the spotlight on the bad guy
4050,"A masterpiece. Mr Phoenix what a performance . A man pushing down by the society. Stand for himself a last and defend the negative people around him. I must say very realistic,also I feel sorry about that neighbor girl . I was hoping a least this went well,but that's was only his imagination. Such a shame... great escape from reality"
4051,"I saw this film twice in two days and I loved it. I was gripped and at the edge of my seat all the way through. Joaquin played a brilliant part, he mastered the true essence of what the Joker should be. People complaining that it is too dark and depressing, it's meant to be! Seeing the truth behind the mental illness and the treatment from the government showed the effects the system can have on someone. Highly recommend seeing this film"
4052,"This film looks likes and is ...cinema. I really didn't think they that any more. it's probably due to the setting in a grim but intensely real Gotham City, which has never been more like a truly unattractive new york (without the landmarks of course).Joachim Phoenix is understated but mesmerising. Fundamentally vulnerable for much of the movie, his becoming is slow but inexorable. He won't be become quite the Joker you're used to, but be assured he will become the Joker, one with a great deal more depth than we've had before.In a sense that's part of why the film's met with some mixed critical responses. Some of the critical voices have been quite vocal in condemning not the film so much as the 'wrong message' they feel it conveys. While the film certainly doesn't glamorise the violence in the Joker, since it explains it from the inside, it does make us sympathise fundamentally with the character, a rare feat given that he is portrayed as an abused, socially awkward, mentally ill loner, the kind who society mainly hears about when like in the Joker they decide to do something to be remembered by. The fear being articulated in other words is that the film with it's portrayal of a cathartic explosion of violence by the socially rejected will inspired others to follow.People sometimes are inspired by films to act out, in good ways and bad, but fears like that seem misplaced & betray one of the worst aspects of modern movie-making, namely, that much of it seems to involve very conscious efforts at social control. Angry loners have been doing angry loner things for a long time and an actual study into why human explosions do happen, the discovery of what it's like to be on the other side of the glass so to speak, probably isn't going to make things much better or worse, except insofar as understanding people and what makes them tick, what makes them angry or sad etc is generally something which makes the world better rather than worse.Moreover the issues also touches on one of the reasons the movie works: because so much of our entertainment & media is made with a conscious awareness of what kind of effect it's supposed to have, what sort of message we, in other words, are supposed to get, we are increasingly left with what often feels like synthetic experiences, involving synthetic feelings, where we are supposed to feel angry or happy, agree or disagree etc on cue. The Joker avoids this kind of socially responsible paint by numbers cinema and for that reason, almost bizarrely given that it's a Batman origin movie within a comic book superhero genre, it feels real, fundamentally authentic.Whether the film makes the world a better or worse place remains to be seen, but ultimately, movies are only supposed to make the world a better place because they are works of art or vision or something approaching that. Having said that many great works of cinema really have been politically or socially subversive & there probably is something of that in this film too. Not only do we have a controversial hero/anti-hero but we also have his identification with the little guy (literally in one scene) within the context of the depiction of social anger & mass uprising against the rich, that more than a little seems to evoke the barely covered by the news mass protests in france for instance, not to mention populist feeling articulated against out of touch 'elites' within the wider international political system.The depiction in places of quasi-revolutionary violence, which in the context of the Batman universe, we have always previously been led to believe was a case of simple thuggery & criminality, does a great deal to turn our perception of things upside down. In this sense the film really is a departure from what we are familiar with. With the humanization of the Joker comes by implication something like a destabilization of the essential goodness of his opponents, if not Batman himself - who as yet doesn't quite exist - then of the plutocrat class Batman represents, which here is ingeniously symbolized by the somewhat ambivalent, but certainly not sympathetic figure of Bruce Wayne's old man.In many ways this sets up potential for good things to come. We already know Bruce Wayne's anger and now we have discovered the source of the Joker's too. Whether Phoenix's Joker will ever meet an adult batman remains to be seen. It probably won't happen, but it would certainly be something to behold"
4053,This movie has created a brand new take on an often reworked character and it does it almost FLAWLESSLY. It managed to make you sympathize and understand the sheer madness that lies at the Joker's foundation. This movie is two hours of pure emotion and you will leave the theater a different person. Please don't believe ANYTHING the critical reviews say such as relating to this movies graphic nature or dark themes. Because honestly if you're an adult and you're seriously too sensitive to handle these elements then save the bad reviews because you're only detouring others who might understand and enjoy the film.
4054,"Absolutely brilliant performance from Joaquin Phoenix. Everything was just perfect. Perfect portrayal of a lunatic supervillain. In a world where we hail the heroes, this movie has given us the chance to see the darker side of an Anti Hero. It also gives a vivid description of the inequal social structure in the present time. If this movie does not win the Oscar then the award itself will lose its value."
4055,"Once an American writer Phillip K. Dick said, 'it is sometimes an appropriate response to reality to go insane.' What would be the nature of that grim reality which compels one towards insanity? It is nothing but our misjudgment of actual situation which makes us to believe that world needs sympathy more than empathy. Living in a credulous state of mind in which we assume that we have fulfilled our responsibility by sympathizing one with some genuine problem without understanding the psychological trauma of that very individual actually creates suffocation in which violence makes lots of sense.In today world of cinema, no film explains this situation better than Todd Phillips' ""Joker"" which in my opinion the most important movie of the decade. Todd Phillips who is better known for his films like ""Road Trip"" and ""The Hangover"" has not only directed but also written the ""Joker"" along with Scott Silver. Even though ""Joker"" is a known DC character but the kind of treatment Todd Phillips has given to this film is nothing but jaw dropping. Realism and dark narrative in comic based films were started with Christopher Nolan's ""Batman Begins"" but Todd Phillips dark tale of ""Joker"" twitches issues like mental health and depleting level of societal sensitivity which give ""Joker"" an exclusive status in cinematic history reserved only for all time classic films like ""Citizen Kane"" and ""The Godfather"". With his writing and directing ""Joker"" Todd Phillips has alleviated the standard of comic based films to the level which has been a dream of every filmmaker of all the genres.There are many actors who have played the role of Joker previously but what Joaquin Phoenix has done with it is work of a genius and makes us believe that there is always a step by step method to the madness. If Joaquin Phoenix does not win the Best Actor trophy in next year's Oscar on his performance in ""Joker"" then one will ask what kind of perfection in acting Academy is looking for? Robert De Niro as Murray Franklin the host of late night TV show is satisfactory but he has completely been overshadowed by Joaquin Phoenix which is understandable because this film solely belongs to Phoenix. Cinematography by Lawrence Sher is a major contributor in creating such a cinematic atmosphere which gives audience same feeling of suffocating grief whenever character of Joaquin Phoenix appears on screen.On the whole, Todd Phillips' classic re-creation of ""Joker"" is a kind of film which will remain a focal point of many film critics from several angles, who have already started a positive controversy by identifying heavy influence on it from Martin Scorsese's films like ""Taxi Driver"" and ""King of Comedy"" but the fact remains ""Joker"" has its own standalone individuality. Few critics have also warned about the level of violence shown in ""Joker"" but they should know that scattered pieces of our insanity sometime require focus, and violence provides it. Violence in any form and situation cannot be justified but in some grey areas of insensitive societies it does find its justification and audience's applaud in penultimate stages of the film proves it vividly."
4056,"Amazing actor performance, camera shots, soundtrack, realistic and dark!
Film of the year for me without a doubt."
4057,"Best film ever highly recommend emotional captivating breathtaking
About time DC made a decent movie i cried about 2 minutes in😭😭."
4058,It's simply a ART from Joaquin performance to the plot to the cinematography.
4059,"Joker Review, No spoilers
My rating for Joker: 9.5 !
LOVED the movie!!! Had me thinking the whole time. Had its aha moments, moments of sadness and laughter. I am almost positive that we ALL laughed out loud at the same scenes...especially that one scene in the apartment near the end of the movie. Bringing up the 2 father figures and an ill mother really helped develop Arthur along with the tragedies that happened in his life.
His condition was believable based off of his excellent performance and animated laugh. Loved that Zazie Beetz was in this movie. Adored her character. Appreciated how a Joker movie was not all about Batman or Bruce Wayne. I couldn't have done the ending any better because the implication was perfect and they didn't have to spell it out for us. I'm convinced that Todd Phillips, the main producer, is an absolute genius. After watching this emotional rollercoaster, this movie deserves AT LEAST an Golden Globe nomination, if not a victory.
My only criticism is on some of the camera shots, although I understand how hard it is to make sure the main subject of the shots are always in the limelight. For instance, the train and bank scene . Also, depending on what kind of a movie watcher you are, you may not enjoy the layout of the music. For me, it was enjoyable.Do you think this joker movie will tie into Robert Pattinson's Batman movie?"
4060,"The character development shown is so good, you actually feel for Arthur (Joker). Phoenix has done a terrific job at portraying a mentally ill Arthur on his descent to madness. Todd Phillips has done a truly remarkable job at storywriting (with Scott Silver) and directing. A must watch. Joaquin's acting is undoubtedly Oscar worthy.Also, big big credits to the background musician. Perfectly complements every scene in the movie."
4061,"Showing the quirks of the human nature (certainly not talking about Joker here). When we see someone different, someone vulnerable, someone we can bully easily as humans we tend to jump on the opportunity of letting them know very well that they're misfits, they don't belong with us, they make us uncomfortable. We push these already broken souls to a level of madness where they retaliate in the way they were treated their whole lives, the place they never wanted to venture to...
And when they become what we pushed them into becoming, we condemn them... what hypocrites WE are ...."
4062,"The Movie takes you through a journey where you see this iconic character develop and transform right in front of your eyes.
The cinematography, music, colors, editing and above all the superb acting of Joaquin. Just go in wanting to enjoy your time."
4063,"DC's Joker 2019, a stunning acting act. It has a deep and beautiful movie. The tension of the acting is very strong and the plot is very good. For the first time in history, it is scored for the sake of good looks."
4064,"Heart Joaquin Phoenix. Heart New York. This is what happens when film is elevated from movie, to cinema, to art! Every element of this film, editing, writing, directing, cinematography, music, sets, make up, characters, performance is the the best of its craft."
4065,"Intelligent, tragic, realistic (in a it-could-feasibly-happen way), superb music, and beautifully acted with great cinematography. Just great."
4066,"I rarely give a perfect note but this movie deserves 100%. An origin story like you have never seen before. It seems so real that it could easily happen in the real world.
It points a finger to real life problems like desinstitutinalisation and the lack of help and follow up for people who suffer from psychiatric problems.
Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely incredible. He is not playing the Joker... he IS the Joker. His performance deserves an Academy Award. He is a method actor who transforms his body and his soul for his roles.
The cinematography (Lawrence Sher) is breathtaking. He is able to create a very heavy and dark ambiance that keeps us hooked. It's visually stunning. As the transformation of Arthur into the Joker advances, the camera makes the character seem bigger and just with that we can feel the confidence that he develops.
Todd Phillips has written, produced and directed was is, in my opinion, a work of art. The movie is heavy and difficult to watch at times. There are some very graphic and violent scenes but they are all necessary to the character development. I very rarely feel a deep internal unease as I watch a movie but I did as I watched how sad and tragic Arthur's life was.
The fact that they are able to make the watchers feel compassion for a psychopath is not an easy task.
The character development makes sense for once.
This is not a comic book movie. It's a character study.
Wow."
4067,"In a time where super hero movies dominate the circuit, it is so refreshing to get to see the other side i.e. the ""villains"" perspective. This was done so beautifully that i actually felt sorry for the Joker. Jared Leto's performance for me was horrible. JP has really come to the fore, i even got chills, from when he laughed profusely to his whole body structure. Really impressed with this movie and the story line. A must watch. Heath Ledger would be proud :). Bwahahahahahaha"
4068,Best movie ever made since Taxi Driver on individual struggles.
4069,This movie doesn't need my review because this is beyond the limit of my imagination and the best for 2019.
4070,Very nice movie and the acting is outstanding. Oscar winning on acting
4071,"One of the best aspects about DC's iconic Clown Prince of Crime, The Joker, is the ambiguity of his origins. Alan Moore's phenomenal graphic novel The Killing Joke (1988) provides us with one of the many possible origins for the character, but even Moore's renowned interpretation isn't considered to be the definitive backstory. Making his debut in Batman #1 in 1940, The Joker remains one of the most recognisable villains in the history of comics. Each appearance of The Joker, from The Dark Knight Returns (1986) to The Killing Joke, to Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on a Series Earth (1989) to Batman R.I.P (2008), and many, many more, stands as a uniquely different portrayal of the character, while still maintaining the core essence of his psychotic persona. Todd Philips' stand-alone origin story Joker is no exception. Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) is a party clown pursuing a career (unsuccessfully) as a stand up comedian in Gotham City. He lives in a rundown apartment with his mother, Penny (Frances Conroy), and suffers from a condition which causes him to laugh uncontrollably in inappropriate situations. Disregarded by society, Arthur slowly spirals into a life of crime, paving the way for the creation of his maniacal alter-ego, Joker.When it was announced Warner Bros. Pictures were developing a stand-alone Joker film, I was one of the many sceptics who claimed (with absolute confidence) that such an idea was unnecessary. Heath Ledger delivered an outstanding performance as The Joker in The Dark Knight (2008), and his portrayal has been long regarded as the highwater mark for those daring enough to adopt the role. Jared Leto's odd, over-the-top portrayal of the Clown Prince of Crime wasn't embraced by neither fans nor critics in 2016's terrible Suicide Squad, which led many to believe the Joker role had become untouchable since Ledger's critically acclaimed portrayal. However, in Joker, Joaquin Phoenix delivers an Oscar worthy performance as the titular character. Phoenix embodies the role perfectly; his performance doesn't mimic Ledgers (and rightfully steers clear of all Leto's shortcomings), and instead crafts a whole new take on the character while still maintaining the core essence of what makes The Joker so renowned. Phoenix brings a damaged realness to the role and embraces the sinister undercurrents of Fleck's mentally disturbed psyche. At times, he's downright unnerving. On occasion, I was reminded of Matt Dillon's performance as Jack in Lars von Trier's serial killer epic The House That Jack Built (2018). Both Arthur and Jack are mentally disturbed loners who harbour sinister urges, but what distinguishes Arthur Fleck from Trier's Jack (who, by all accounts, is a killer who isn't fumbling for validation in his crimes) is how he finds justification for enacting his own immoral sense of justice onto a society that has wrongfully disregarded him. It is important to note that you aren't coerced into rooting for Arthur as he descends further into madness. By no means is Joker portrayed as an antihero; you sympathise with him when the film begins, but this sympathy is short-lived once Fleck ultimately falls victim to his own heinous choices. From his maniacal laugh to his off-kilter, deranged mannerisms, Phoenix delivers a masterclass performance that would certainly make Ledger proud.Make no mistake, Joker is not what you've come to expect from the modern day comic book film. Philips and Silver have crafted a script that is grounded in reality and, at its core, it is a focused, psychological character study that trades in CGI spectacle (something that largely dominates comic book blockbusters these days) for mean-spirited, gritty nihilism. It's brilliantly constructed and certainly benefits from repeat viewings, as there is much of the film that is left open to interpretation. Hildur Guðnadóttir provides the film with a terrific score; it's brooding and eerily atmospheric, and stands as one of the best film scores of recent memory. It is a film dripping with atmosphere and tension that gradually elevates towards a finale that embraces the anarchy that Joker is known for. Joker has certainly garnered its fair share of controversy on the road towards its highly anticipated release, largely due to its violence and perceived influence it may inflict on audiences. While the film certainly has its violent moments, the violence never once overshadows the central narrative, nor is it as violent as the detractors would have you believe. What Joker ultimately serves as is a cautionary tale, while shining a light on how corruption can manifest within society.Joker is everything one could want from a Joker origin story. Dark, tense and fiercely gripping, it stands as one of the all time great Joker stories with a career best performance from Phoenix at the heart of it all. Destined to become a celebrated classic, Joker is this years must see film."
4072,"Absolutely stunning.
One of the best dc movies ever"
4073,"Good actor good film
This movie will be legends."
4074,"Such a beautiful work done by Todd Phillips. This is nothing like previous DC comic movies/stories, a complete new story of the character Joker. And Joaquin Phoenix is the perfect guy to play this role."
4075,"This is a treat for DC fans Inauguration of crime prince clown story, one of the greatest of all comic movies ever made, without any VFX and super hero drama. This movie is class apart."
4076,"Joker is not a movie of pretense. It is about the truth.I think most people who disliked this movie disliked it because they were expecting some fairy tale, like they always do. But that's not the reality, is it? It hardly ever is. This movie portrays how much society can break you from within. This movie shows the struggle of a common man. It doesn't need any universe to follow, because it is a masterpiece on it's own.I went in to see a movie about this DC villain, but what did I get? I got exposed to the truth. It was certainly clever how the writers mixed a fictional character with someone who's living in this world and gave us something we kept thinking about hours after we came back from the theater.And Joaquin Phoenix's performance as Joker was as moving as the script. It was dark, it was bone-chilling and most importantly, it was brave. To portray a character like that, it takes guts. And he did justice.In all, it was worth it. Making this film was worth it. Received by many as a cold-hearted comedy, well you have it. That's life."
4077,"Truly a masterpiece. Beautiful cinematography, script, plot and acting. The feeling one gets after viewing this films remains with them. I shall be watching it at least one hundred more times."
4078,"Undeniably mesemerizing, dark, twisted and an overwhelmingly instense portrayal of an iconic comical villan and his disturbing view of the society, anxiety and nihilism leading to self destruction. Joaquin Phoenix is the defining origin of the Joker! Simply breathtaking."
4079,"If you imagine it is a good film it is better, much better. One of the best films of the last years.
It's amazing how among so much garbage a film like this can appear in these days.
Although Joaquin Phoenix is a safe bet (10 as an actor) the movie is simply much than his great interpretation."
4080,"This is the Best DC comics based movie, the Joker is supreme, but I still prefer the Joker of Batman the Dark Knight (Heath Ledger)"
4081,"I could be one day describing all the mixed feelings this movie left on me, one of the greatest movie of all times"
4082,"This is the best adaptation of the joker since dark knight , if joaquin pheonix doesn't win an oscar this year something's wrong , the acting , the music score , the cinematography , i mean what a goddamn masterpiece , you have to watch this !!!"
4083,Raw and beautiful. A masterpiece of audiovisual art.
4084,"Brilliant movie and the most realistic character portrayal I've witnessed in a long time.
JP is The Joker....get well soon JP!"
4085,"Although the storyline is not so impressive, the performance of Phoenix is extraordinary. A must watch movie."
4086,Film of the year. Excellent execution of the most twisted comic book character of all time. It almost makes you want to side with the Joker. Go watch it.
4087,"Uniqueness of this production, when compared with Batman comic books, games and other movies, is undeniable. Joker's identity and his plans are very much the opposite of a mystery in here. This shift in perspective may just be what ""Joker"" needed to be the best movie based on a character from DC.For some reason, Joker is always taken very seriously by actors playing his role. Jack Nicolson's and Heath Ledger's Jokers were definitely phenomenal yet mostly acted by voice and facial expressions. It's fair to say that Joaquin Phoenix raised the bar by an order of magnitude. In his version of the Joker, voice acting and facial expressions are just minor parts of a bigger picture. His Joker moves like Joker. His Joker laughs and dances like Joker. It's very apparent how his Joker thinks, and he thinks like the Joker. He just feels like him. The level of immersion is unprecedented.Artistically, ""Joker"" is just beautiful. Music is perfect, Gotham feels enchanting but depressing, character costumes are very appealing. Whole experience is hypnotic, almost like in a comic book.Besides a true Joker and good Gotham, the movie contains some less important themes which aren't bad but may be distracting. It felt like they put two rather irrelevant scenes featuring young Bruce Wayne just for the sake of using the franchise. I also think that yet another version of Batman origins scene is the last thing a DC fan would like to see. All easily forgivable as everyone leaves their yaw on cinema floor anyway."
4088,"This movie tops the limits of what you can feel in a super hero movie like no other. No plain black and white characters no good vs evil. Just emotions and feelings. With some of the best scenes portraying the cinema industry like, joker dance, joker running and joker puts a bloody smile on his face. I definitely will have issues watching support hero's movies that will cover all the struggles and emotional drama in favor of punchlines and tension reliefs."
4089,1 word- wow. Watch this masterpiece without spoilers and you will just be amazed
4090,Taking on a completely new perspective on the greatest villian of all time
4091,"No cgi just realistic life. Just saw it in the cinema on SundayThey say there's no money to be made anymore with serious, gritty dramas.
They say that. But not this
But then they haven't seen Joker, the origin story of Batman's arch-enemy, co-written and directed by Todd Phillips
This is hidden masterpiece
Arthur Fleck is an oddball in a cruel, intolerant world that doesn't have time to care for vulnerable people.There is not a career adviser on the planet who would have pushed him in that direction.
He's a chap who wants to put a smile on people's faces, and so he becomes a clown-for-hire during the day and an amateur stand-up comic at nightHe lives in a Gotham City that's gone to the dogs:no sun uncollected garbage bags pile up like stinking black skyscrapers, welfare budgets have been slashed, and mass civil unrest is one small trigger-point away In realism for flash point of seismic portions and with the keys to power and copycats on the lose

This gives a mega boast in grittness creepiness the joker has connections issues falling between the cracks of austerity in Gotham his grubbness in his makeup as his art of choice giving his deception like Inspiring his vendetta for life life and he is failing at everything because he hasn't a talent that descends to madness as mother's stories bring vengeance her love and his for her in is a downside there run down building and many fantasies of his neighbours and with hatred for the elite. his laughing illness that is creppy uncontrolled leads to situations that causes his bleakness in human society that in ""to cleanse, purge in away spirals into unimaginable events
So when lives are taken it makes the city tense looking to a void for some cult to follow he becomes their clown Prince his cult action of arising from hellish tormentall over a character no human soul just feeding rich people's lies of being family and mistrust of and using his
His only pleasure comes from watching Murray Franklin's chat show, on to which he dreams of being invited one day. Robert De Niro plays the legendary TV host,
Phoenix plays Arthur's tragic descent in a way which seemingly encourages our empathy but makes sure he never really gets it: so on the package this is the health warning we know he's not a character to whom you'd dont want to get too close. He will give you smile of approval his death sentence
, who plays a role in setting Joker down the path that turns him into the sociopathic clown
So the joker is up for 11 Oscar including best actor and best picture. He is deserves best actor for his portrayed of demented soulJoachim grips the hellish torment of a tormented soul and gives a classic portrayal of angst his character dillusions delve deep into the void and this film is taxi driver
Instead you have Joaquin Phoenix uses his weird charisma giving Daniel Day-Lewis esque performance of such intensity and weirdness, it will either have the Academy clowning the prizes in for realism
There is a maniacal emptiness behind his eyes which is a bit creepy.
The sun never shines in this Gotham City.Class war simmers while the media crank up the tension with inflammatory headlines and irresponsible TV shows that give airtime to the wrong people for the wrong reasons. The elite live in a pampered bubble without a care in the world, wilfully ignorant of the hardships other folk suffer. It might be set in the early 1980s, but it is clearly a parable about the here and now.
mythology, but has now been bolstered in Joker by an unflinching deep dive into his origins. Pulling back the curtain on the Joker was a risk, but it's one that pays off hugely here as Phoenix's portrayal of the character, who has been played many ways by many actors to varying degrees of success, is unique and if anything, more terrifying, as this story is so grounded in a quasi-reality and the most real-worldly Gotham we've seen. If you haven't got a phobia of clowns you will after this creepy but stunning movie of the year.Joker is infamous classic one for the ages. 10/10"
4092,"Never was there a more pertinent film for a time when society is beginning to fragment and people are becoming disenfranchised from family, core human values and love. Joker is not a 'Batman' type movie of the super hero genre; no, its much more important than that. Joker is not make believe; it's real. It's happening all around us and all over the world. Yet what is happening simultaneously, are the incredible webs of lies and deceit that are spun to delude and keep the truth down.Joachim Phoenix delivers an incredible performance that is central to the film's success. Bet he won't win an Oscar though because the liberal elite will find this film a tad hard to swallow. Liberal feedback is that the film is too violent however the trailers before this film started were 'acceptable' violence of endless garbage gratuitous films for the brain dead. Joker is a symbol of all those people in the world who are not cared for, loved or cherished - firstly by their nearest and dearest and then by society itself. When these people begin to disintegrate, we walk straight past them; be they addicts, homeless, refugees, mentally ill and the suchlike. Social media has only ingrained humanity's ability to isolate and take advantage of people's weaknesses or to downright use people to make money and so the 'super elite' are born. The super elite are the version (rats are everywhere in Gotham) who prey on the filth all around them. As we see Joker begin his downward spiral in to severe mental illness we can only lament that this illness permeates every part of media and politics and drug companies and crime of modern society. Joker leaves one question unanswered - where do we got from here?"
4093,The sequence of events in the movie was amazing.. we lived every moment with Arthur (Joaquin Phoenix)
4094,I don't usually leave reviews for films but I thought this film was incredible. I've never left a cinema theatre where I was unable to pin point my emotional state before. The film makes you generally question society and how you fit into the world we have all built.. Incredibly tense!
4095,"Amazing movie everything was perfect sound track, acting, story line ect....Myself being a huge fan of the Batman/Joker character this really hit me, the joker in this movie just reminds me on how the Joker should be from the comics.I think a lot of people won't like it (young viewer) as everyone is too sensitive and peoole will be affected by the story line but please remember this is old school no special affects just great movie director and an amazing actor!"
4096,The script - the acting - the music - the build up - the suspense - the vision... all 10/10. Watched it a few days ago and still in awe.
4097,"UGH, my heart will always hold a special place for Heath Ledger as Joker but this is next level good. It shows a completely different perspective of the Joker than any other movie has ever done. It captures how mentally unstable he really is and what made him become ""The Joker"" which was the coolest part. There is a reason why it's rated R though, very dark and some scenes left feeling me feeling uneasy."
4098,"Joaquin Phoenix is amazing, one of the best films i've ever seen in my entire life."
4099,An absolutely stunning performance by Joaquin Phoenix. Also the direction of the movie was exceptional.
4100,"Joker is one movie I can watch more than 10 times...I love the way Joaquin Phoenix perfected as the Joker.
This movie is Pitch Perfect In all Departments..so pls watch it as it's a Must Watch for all."
4101,"Wow. wow. wow.
it just impacts you in a weird but good way."
4102,"I can't understand how tf can someone hate this movie.
Music was perfect
Acting was perfect
cinematography was perfect
In short everything was perfect"
4103,"I watch the movie I normally watch once more and it sounds like torture.
but this movie is like therapy ...
If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get the Oscar, remove the Oscar! ..."
4104,"Joker from beginning to end keeps you enthralled, not only through the eyes of Arthur Fleck but Gotham city as its slowly crippling before our eyes. Joker has such ambiguity towards a lot of its subjects and scenes that there is no concrete answer to a lot of what happens in the film which is amazing because it leaves you asking questions and starting a conversation and debate with other movie goers, I dont want to give too much away other than to simply watch the movie."
4105,"First of all when there were news going on that a movie is going to be made for joker I didn't wanted that to happen coz i felt nobody could replace what heath had did! But after watching trailer, posters and finally the movie I was amazed and felt that even heath wouldn't have pulled of this prequel joker role better than Joaquin ❤. This man deserves an oscar for his acting. The story is simple and almost in all the scenes we will have to face joker alone but I never felt it was boring coz of this man's acting.The movie makes you really really uncomfortable and that's exactly what this movie needs it's audience to feel. I felt like someone is pushing something down my throat . And the movie also had very less or in fact no cg works and was so realistic that I got connected to it very very easily. The movie very barely had any jokes though joker laughs most of the time in the movie . Robert de Niro also did his role to perfect. The movie had a very great screenplay and great bgm which kept me engaged throughout. Atlast after coming out felt happy for watching such a film and at the same felt bad for on what It dealt with.
P. S. This movie has some scenes of Batman✌and completes the cycle too"
4106,"Among the most anticipated movies in 2019, two have clowns as main characters. One is the adaptation of a novel about the return of a monster clown. The other is of course the backstory to the birth of Batman's arch nemesis: The Joker.The latest cinematic iteration involving the Clown Prince of Crime easily gets 9/10 in my book. I was helplessly hooked from the start, even if it's dragging like an extended bad trip to a wrong rabbit hole. I have my resentment towards this movie, though. How would I not: I had to watch the movie twice in two days, just so that I could assure myself the movie is a mere product of art, not a real footage of one's miserable life that brings all my pities and makes it all so relatable.Joaquin Phoenix as Joker is flawless and perfect. The pain and angst presented through his lines, interjections, mimical expressions and physical movements are all so real. His portrayal of a character who constantly struggle with a ""condition"" amidst the depression and disillusionment in his entire life is of utmost brilliance. It's hard to imagine any other actors in the business currently who coukd take the role to such a devastating effect, not even the Oscar nominated Jared Leto :-DThis year's Joker is last year's Freddy Mercury. Both provide a great template for the lead actors to explore and exploit an already well known figure (a source of other actors' envy), though Joker is certainly more multi-dimensional as a character. Since Heath Ledger's portrayal, we are used to see a Joker who's not always tidy and well dressed.Joaquin Phoenix helped create a sequential environment where the titular character is finally at his most insane state of mind, unlike Heath Ledger who brought up a maniacal/chaotic personification from the outset. It effectively provides the real and sensible feelings as we can witness Arthur Fleck's transformation from a helpless loser into someone that resorts to chaos and violence to ease his pains. No previous movies with similarly dark and disturbing nuances, such as ""Pi"" or ""Requiem for a Dream"", or even any of David Lynch' offerings in his most depressed mode, had left me THAT bothered and yet impressed all the same.""Joker"" is not a mere character study: it's a psychological outreach programme served fresh from Hollywood's darkest alleys. If Joaquin doesn't get the Oscar, I'm suing the Academy."
4107,"Wowsers! Believe the hype, it is that good! Weak Batman undercurrent for those who dismiss comic book themed movies this one tells you more about society than one of the best on screen villains of all time.For a two hour movie to flyby leaving you wanting more, it has my vote."
4108,"Since I've heard about the rumors about a Joker origin movie being made up to the point where I've heard that Todd Phillips film Joker has won The Golden Lion Award at TIFF and in doing so it has become the first comic book/superhero movie that won the big award at TIFF,I knew that,as a huge fan of the character, I had to see Joker in theater.
By the way Joaquin Phoenix portrayal of The Joker is beyond breathtaking and without him,this film wouldn't have won The Golden Lion at TIFF and it wouldn't have been received by both critics and fans of the characters as a masterpiece/amazing movie.
For me,Heath Ledger will be my favorite live action version of the comic book character but Phoenix really adds a big plus to the comic book character history and personality as well as making us feeling sorry for The Clown Prince of Crime and not to sympathize or to condone what Arthur Fleck/Joker does to people like Murray Franklin and Thomas Wayne but to understand why he does it and unlike Arthur/Joker,both of them don't give a damn about the people like him ,the people who are poor and have serious medical problems.
I really loved all the scenes from Todd Phillips movie and if I would have to pick 4 favorite scenes from the movie than those would be:the subway scene where Arthur Fleck kills those 3 guys who worked for Thomas Wayne because they bullied Arthur,the stairway dance scene,the hole talk show scene where Arthur kills Murray and the final scene where Arthur is in Arkham Asylum and starts laughing and after a few seconds we see a flashback with the youg Bruce Wayne being alone in a dark alley and in front of him are his parents who are dead and after that a woman who is in there with Arthur and it's his psychologist ask Arthur to tell her the joke that Arthur laughed and Arthur says "" You wouldn't understant it"".
That final scene is verry similar to the end from Alan Moore comic book Batman The Killing Joke where Joker starts telling Batman a joke that only the two of them would understant it.
I really loved Joaquin Phoenix in this movie and he should really win The Best Actor Award at the Oscar Ceremony.
The same thing goes for Todd Phillips as well,he should win at least one of these 3 Oscar Awards(Best Picture,Best Director,Best Original Screenplay) and Hildur Guðnadóttir should win the Oscar for Best Original Score because without her,both Joker and Chernobyl wouldn't have been complete.
Honestly,I don't know if Joker will have a sequel or not,Todd Phillips has said that this movie is a standalone DC film and that right now he doesn't have in mind a sequel for the film but if Joaquin Phoenix would want to do a sequel with him and if Warner Bros will ask him if he can do a sequel,than he might do it.
I personally prefer for Joker to not have a sequel because it might ruin the well received love/praise for this film.
Overall,Todd Phillips movie Joker is not just a great character study film but it is the 2nd if not the best DC movie ever and none of this would have been possible without Joaquin Phoenix performance as The Joker."
4109,"Knock knock
.
Who's this?

Masterpiece.

First of all the Soundtracks/Music awesome.

One will find boring or waste but its up to you because everyone have a different taste.
I'll give 9 stars.

4110,"Joaquin was able to play the role with unprecedented success.History will remember this great performance, we congratulate him in advance for his Oscar 2019."
4111,"A masterpiece . I have no other words to say...The visuals are impressive , the story is very interesting , the performances are great , the social message is timeless."
4112,"The movie is not of very complicated nuances where to be called brilliant it should be thought upon much, a simple, straightforward story telling of a man in his real world with everything pitch perfect, don't listen to critics, watch it yourself, of course it's dark, but it's true to the core and brilliant."
4113,"Joker is a character study, it is how a society can create a villain and later ridicule them for turning into one.It starts with long shots of the protagonist laughing uncontrollably while his shrink watches on with an insensitive gaze. His constant restless legs and his laugh invoked by a medical condition along with his attempts to control it delivers an allegory to his hard attempts to not give in to the madness that is building up inside him. The idea of how death could bring more meaning than life scribbled in his book also gives another glimpse of how tired is he fighting every day with the piling up dirt. As much as the protagonist tries to do good, his actions are discouraged consistently: whether its the occupational stress and politics, public in general on the sidewalk or the bus.
His lonely walks across the neighborhood especially the long stretch of stairs that he goes up towards his building shows the efforts he puts to stay the good man his mamma always wanted.He becomes the sponge to the society's bullying crowd, until the scene where in his utter desperation of losing the job under an unfair situation he shoots few folks in the train. This does confuse and petrify him when he is out in the station but as he closes the door and comes in touch with his inner self, his feet naturally begin to move to match the tune of evil calling out to him for so long. And comes a dance, the dance of liberation, the dance of feeling himself, so truly.The madness inside, keeps reaching out to the surface as the shrink prescribed pills are stopped as well. His delusions start going out of control. The more he kills, the better he feels and when he finally lets himself fall into the madness, we can see him going down the stairs wearing the suit all decked up for a talk show with a rejuvenated confidence and energy.
Towards the final scenes, Joker licks his own blood and draws a smile on his face, seemingly enjoying the taste of his blood and also being acknowledged newly hailed king of anarchy. Or did he? The film is viewed through the unreliable eyes of Joker, who may have imagined the entire resurrection while being in Arkham Asylum, but it is all left open to the audience to interpret and let the imaginations run wild.The film is a metamorphosis of the character from the crouched-bound by the world of unfairness and appearances to the man who lets his monster free, a monster that was born and grew on the backfires of the society.The film carries a daunting background score created mostly on a cello and other string based instruments. Understandably, music is directed by Hildur Guðnadóttir (Chernobyl) who herself is a cello player. It is a refreshing shift from the arresting music of Hans Zimmer we are accustomed to in the The Dark Knight universe.The scenes are artistic and well shot. There are many scenes with flickering lights, symbolizing the disturbance in the psyche of the protagonist. Gotham is presented as a city where the rich-poor gap is widening, there is an underground revolution in the making with chaotic graffiti all over the subway and city walls. The frustrated poor and the underprivileged exploited by the rich, protests and search for a face and a leader for their movement. With garbage lying scattered, the disorganization of the city is very visible.Joaquin has been flawless and brilliant in his portrayal of Joker. The fluid dance, his wide-stepped run or the trademark laugh, all stay with you long after the film is over.Joker is not just a comic film made to entertain, it is a thesis on the society how the lack of a simple virtue of sympathy can spiral anybody out of control. It's everyone's story who have wanted to scream and let their monsters out. It is very easily my favorite of the year and would likely stay so when the year ends. As our very own Thanos (Josh Brolin) puts it, ""Joker is simply lifting the rug and looking underneath it. Nothing more, Nothing less."""
4114,Joaquin Phoenix's performance was par excellence in the movie. He owned the screen for all of 2 hours and 2 minutes. Simply quintessential. In my head I have already given him an Oscar for the movie.
4115,"What are you going here, if you haven't watch the movie yet. First watch the movie then give your views, because this movie is only made to watch in theatres. This is the far most the Best movie of 2019 or you can say the entire comic movie industry. Joaquin Phoenix is all we want as a joker in every DC movie. Todd Philips has a great vision to create and know how a anti hero movie can also be so great. This is not just a anti hero movie it's the movie where we need to more educated. Hats off and. respect."
4116,"This movie brought all the darkness and the sadness from the Joker's head to the screen. The movie is perfectly picturing the life from the Joker's psychological situation. It wasn't sad in a funny way, it was funny in a sad way.This movie is one of the best ever."
4117,"Joker is bold, bizarre, and extremely uncomfortable to watch. Depicting madness and misery of this grandeur is no easy task, and though audiences are split, I found it mesmerizing. I've seen the film two times in the cinema now, and it left me feeling both uneasy and amazed both times. A rare piece of cinema, in other words. Also, big thumbs up for Phoenix being a certified legend, an Oscar is gonna come his way, I'm sure.10/10 - Joker is absolutely nuts, go see it"
4118,"My second Joker review.
With 2,946 user reviews already published within days of the release of Joker, almost all 10 star raves calling it a Masterpiece, best film ever made, a great comic book film, and highly influenced by Scorcese, I feel compelled to respond to this avalanche of hyperbolic enthusiasm with a followup to my own earlier review. That relatively sober review was one of the first published immediately after the world premiere of Joker in Venice a little over a month ago. And I was duly impressed.
As stated then I cannot disagree with any of the raves about Joaquin Phoenix's incredible performance and will be amazed if he does not walk off with the Best Actor Oscar in February. However, while the last section of Joker is brilliant and masterfully directed, the picture as a whole, powerful as it is, is no masterpiece. It drags in places and could be tightened up here and there for better effect. These potholes are smoothed over by Phoenix's hypnotic performance as he is in just about every single scene and constantly rivets attention. It is his picture all the way, while director Todd Phillips seems to be along just for the ride. One of the best movies of this year, definitely, but ""of all time""? -- Come on, give us a break.
Calling this a ""Comic book film"" or a ""superhero film"" is utterly ridiculous.
It is a solid straightforward psychological character study only obliquely connected with the comic book Batman. As for connection with Scorcese's Taxi Driver, again ridiculous. Arthur Fleck has much more in common with Norman Bates of Psycho (including a problematic mother) than with Travis Bickle of Taxi Driver. In any case it is pointless to attempt to derive this unique stand alone study from similar sources. All films have some similarities to other films and this one is what it is. Period.
In an interview Joaquin Phoenix mentioned that he modeled his fantastic dance moves in Joker on Ray Bolger's Scarecrow in The Wizard of Oz. Does that mean these films are connected? -- Joker and Wizard of Oz! Well, why not?
Phoenix deserves every award in sight and the movie itself will be a strong contender for Best film of the year. But super masterpiece it is not. At least, not quite. And it may even be aced out at the finish line in Hollywood.by the likes of Q. Tarantino's ""Once upon a time in Hollywood"".
I am, however, pleased to see that so many viewers respond to this film so positively in spite of all kinds of negative hullabaloo by slithery moralists around the edges. Fellini would have loved it.

4119,"After reading a NYT article about this movie winning the weekend box office, I pondered how crazy it must be to live in a place where going to the cinema requires a calculation on whether you might get shot. Perhaps the hysteria whipped up prior to this film opening makes more sense in a violent society like that stateside, as after seeing it, I don't think it glorified Arthur Fleck, nor did I see it being inspirational to a pathetic incel who feels the need to shoot up a church or a nightclub or a school. It wasn't particularly violent at all, and was much better than I had expected. I really enjoyed the movie a lot, and have found myself thinking about it the next day. Yes, it's basically a comic book movie (with a good segue to the eventual Batman story), and I do agree with Scorsese's recent comment that superhero movies are like theme parks. That's generally why I enjoy those kind of movies, though, as an escape from the awfulness of the world. But sometimes a comic book origin story can actually be about something more, and I agree with Michael Moore that ""this movie is not about Trump. It's about the America that gave us Trump - the America which feels no need to help the outcast, the destitute. The America where the filthy rich just get richer and filthier"". I don't think the movie was necessarily sympathetic to the course of action the character took, but it does help you to see the consequences of a society that's been poisoned by the lack of compassion for the less fortunate and a massive amount of inequality. Joaquin Phoenix has never been one of my favorite actors, but he was excellent here. I'm impressed that director of ""The Hangover"" could craft such a compelling story, and I also think there was something to Todd Phillips' furious reaction against the far-left for their indictment of his movie without ever having seen it. Wherever you fall on the political spectrum, you'll take what you will from any piece of art, and I think this is well worth seeing to form your own opinion. At the very least, it's an enjoyable and well crafted movie. The references and callbacks to some classic 70s movies like ""Taxi Driver"" were well done, too."
4120,"No this does not tie in with previous DC films. No it does not follow any previous joker origins. It is what you've probably already read, a thorough, gritty and harsh character study on an ill outcast of society. It is superbly paced and felt so real to watch and the message behind it is clear, the director and Pheonix delivered what they intended and it isnt pretty. So people need to stop getting mad over the fact theres no cgi fight scenes and the fact it gives us such a deep dive into a persons mind, however messed up, and actually appreciate what theyve done with the character and that they managed to pull off such a meaningful film. 10/10 or ur as delusional as Joker"
4121,"The main reason and the main issue of the film is really simple, when you push a man too far by every his surrounding, Phoenix made a huge improvement to the role and he dealt with mental illness very professionally, and that's something it was really well done, although the final act of the movie was truly breathtaking, for me Phoenix gave a performance of a life time and he souls really get the recognition that he deserves"
4122,"Awesome movie, realistic, great acting. Great performance, played an unbelievable joker. Followed the story line and can't wait for the next chapter"
4123,"Joker is a character study about an insane person. It's not a comic book movie, it's not trying to be. Todd Phillips, who directed the Hangover movies, rose to the occasion here and made a solid origin story about the Joker. However, it's Joaquin Phoenix who makes it memorable and great.The script has flaws, the biggest one being the lack of subtlety in the first half of the movie. I know it's not supposed to be subtle, but the way things constantly go wrong for Arthur - he gets beat up, he loses his job, he gets humiliated - is handled so clumsily.There are a couple of shocking moments. There's a reason this gets compared to Taxi Driver. It's a little clunky at first, but things come together wonderfully in the last act. It's nice to see a movie from the villain's perspective for a change. Things are looking up for DC."
4124,Se acabó la espera!!! A real master piece of cinematography. Joaquin Phoenix will be nominated for the academy awards.
4125,Great character development. Kinda twisted and dark but worth the hype. A must see.
4126,I absolutely loved it. Perfect blend of violencenand action. Manages never to go over the top and actually makes you feel sorry for Arthur at certain points. That is of course until later on in the movie you're reminded about who he really is and you end up absolutely hating him. Definitely a film worth checking out and will be getting on Blu-ray the day it releases
4127,Joaquin Phoenix portrays the Joker excellently. The tone of the movie is fantastic and follows the character well. 10/10
4128,One of those movies where it's you find yourself uncomfortable while watching but completely captivated by it at the same time. I'm a huge DC fan but this transcends superhero flicks and delivers something far beyond that of a comic book adaptation. See this movie!!!
4129,"This movie is truly one of a kind. Joaquin Phoenix does a great job of portraying the complexity of the Joker's inner struggle of understanding who he is while he is simultaneously gaining a clearer understanding of where he fits in society. You can't help but feel empathy as you learn of the Joker's past, even if you completely sided with Bruce Wayne/Batman in The Dark Knight. This will be one to see more than once to really capture all of the subtle nuances that make this movie great."
4130,"First, not for kids! This movie was very rare and dark. It touches you in ways that feel real. With what's going on in the world with real people with real problems, it brings that awareness of people that do have mental diseases. It's unnerving and uncomfortable at times. But that is true acting and story telling. I felt chills, I felt my heart drop at certain points of the movie. Some scenes are genuinely terrifying and it's not a horror movie. Performance worth of at least an Oscar nomination. So glad the emphasis was solely on the Joker and not so much Batman or Bruce Wayne at that. Well done!"
4131,Phoenix definitely deserves an award for this one. Incredible performance.
4132,Best movie I have seen in a very long time- Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal-
4133,"Finally, DC got back into the right track. After so many big budget failures, and simultaneously being knocked down by many Marvels Studios' masterpieces, Shazam! was a spark of hope . but now Joker is a proof that DC is back as strong as the time which was ended by Dark Knight. Joker shows that story is first, acting is second and then is special effects. Todd Philips presented his talent in writing and directing. Joaquin Phoenix portrays another joker, which is the same level as jack Nicolson's and Heath ledger's. when movies was ended I visualized Todd and Joaquin with Oscars in their hands."
4134,It's ridiculous that critics would base a rating on a political message because in reality this is one of the most well acted movies I've ever seen and Phoenix gives Ledger a run for his money. If Phoenix doesn't win an Oscar for this it's because America couldn't handle it.
4135,"I knew this movie would be great since they chose Joaquin Phoenix, I even didn't watch the trailer. However, still it blow my mind. Fall in love with it and Joaquin at first scene. I wish if I can forget it and rewatch it again and again. Thanks to everyone for making such a movie."
4136,"If there is any one movie that could help rebuild DC's image in the eyes of so many enthralled with the MCU after so many DC disappointments, this is it. Seize it DC. Don't lose this possibly wonderful start to a possibly mesmerizing series!!"
4137,"This is not just a great movie is a tremendous one!Phoenix is Joker.Phoenix is Oscar.The character development, back story and reason for being went way and above my expectations. I'd deliberately avoided all reviews and trailers ahead of visiting the cinema and boy I'm glad I did.It's been many years since I've attended a Sunday evening late showing in a cinema with a barely an empty seat, and each seat left entertained! The crowd when leaving were buzzing, something a kin to leaving a mega rock concert. That surely illustrates how good this is as an experience.Super Rats...haha, wonderful.Todd Phillips has made one of the films of this millennium,...and that's not an over statement. This maybe Joker but this film paints a connection closer between graphic novel and modern day society with its Inception-esque divides and dying lack of humanity and empathy.The Joker is made by and reinvents society. A CLASSIC!!! Thank you Mr Phillips and Mr Phoenix (and all involved)."
4138,"This is by far my favorite movie I have seen. I rarely go to the theater, but I saw this movie on opening day with a friend, as well as the day after with some different friends. Without giving away spoilers, this movie is atmospherically a psychological horror movie with no jumpscares. Even causal movie fans will leave the theater unable to stop thinking about it.It's sad we don't get many movies like these. I will definitely watch it a third time when it comes out digitally. Don't watch it if you didn't enjoy Taxi Driver, or The Machinist. It is also not for children or people who are sensitive to certain topics."
4139,"If you are going to watch it thinking that it will be an action movie
Well it is not
This movie is so deep
And that explains why a lot of people didn't get it
You can do some readings before watch it
Read about Anarchism
And is good and bad are objective or subjective
And culture and counterculture
Also I recommend a book
by George Orwell -animal farm-
So yah you really need to know stuff to get it"
4140,"It's not often a movie makes an impact on me. In fact it's close to rare. 
""Joker"" is a unique masterpiece in so many ways. I am absolutely blown away by the acting, music, cinematography, script, makeup, and the whole feel this movie has. It's dark, sad and very realistic. It does a great job at showing the viewer, a story of a troubled mind, and answers the question ""What if the joker lived in our world. How would he have gotten there. What could push a person so far out, and hate society so much"".
The scary thing is, you can really relate to his journey.
Wonderful job everyone on the team of this movie.
And kudos to DC Comics for daring to make this movie.
Thank you."
4141,"One of the best movies of recent times, a movie which should not be left without a statuette for both its magnificent protagonist and for an impeccable direction of Todd Phillips. That ambiguous atmosphere was maintained throughout the movie due to having the point of view of the prince of crime. Masterpiece."
4142,"It's more like a drama that depicts evil bureaucracy in our society. Seems a little overhyped, but it's a good movie. It shows are different and how bad the lives of certain people are, and that we're to self-obsessed to take notice or/and care. Story of a man with a tragic life really. That's what this movie is in a nutshell. You don't need to think of so much more than that."
4143,"I could feel his sorrow and sadness behind his compulsory laughter . He only wanted to spread smiles and joy to the kids.
Joker movie touched its audience in a way no other movie could."
4144,"Joaquin Phoenix absolutely nailed it. Excellent acting, directing, and an amazing atmosphere in this movie. My only complaint is I wish we could have seen more of his time as the Joker once he's introduced on television. I would of liked to have seen more schemes or something else after his transformation. Regardless the final act of this film is haunting and magnificent.I'll give this a 9.1/10."
4145,"I have been telling this my whole life. Mental abuse and mental injuries are far worse than physical. Even the smallest ones! They almost never heal.I don't understand why so many people still ignore power of the mind, soul, however you want to call it.Great job every single person involved in this creation! Great F... job!"
4146,What the title says. Go watch the movie now! It's truly phenomenal without a doubt.
4147,"Joker is making lots of headlines. Here's my take. Joker is a peer to A Clockwork Orange and Taxi Driver vs. a superhero movie. Joker is a very dark character piece on how a damaged loner is alienated beyond his breaking point. This is a very disturbing and excellent film. Joaquin Phoenix will be a Best Actor nominee for certain. The movie is drenched with important issues- mental illness, income disparity, healthcare, and how a society responds when these needs are not met. Joker is about the death of empathy. Jokers are created, they don't fall out of a comic book or become evil because they played too much Grand Theft Auto. I've read about folks walking out of this movie. I hope that those folks simply miscalculated, thinking they were going to see Iron Man or Captain America. The alternative reason is choosing not to see the seeds of dystopia all around us"
4148,One of the few movies that comes around that you will remember forever. An absolute masterclass. Phoenix has brought to life some brilliant characters and I've been a fan but the way he built and portrayed this character is on another level. Daniel Day Lewis is one of the all time great method actors and deserved triple Oscar winner but Phoenix for me takes this crown. Two of the best hours ever. If he does not get an Oscar for this film (and Todd Phillips for Directing) - how can the Oscars ever be considered credible.
4149,"You can feel how Arthur little by little, without medication and with it he gives in to madness and comes to embrace her after so much suffering. A renegade, a nobody, who is mistreated by a battered society. It has this thin thread of comedy and what it is not and what it means for society, and she has that laugh that sees her as an evil, but it is her salvation from how miserable life is in Gotham or what she can be now Although maybe it's an inciting movie, it's not an awkward movie, it's not a twisted story, it's a voice, it's necessary (in many ways), it makes you feel ... it's art and it's brutal."
4150,"Not everyone can catch its deeper meaning. It's not for everyone. Please, don't expect like The Dark Knight. That movie was all about what Joker can do, and this one is all about how he became Joker. I loved the movie and still can not understand why some people hate it. Just ignore them, it's worth watching. I wouldn't be surprised if Joaquin Phoenix gets nominated for Best Performance by an Actor (in a Leading Role) and win it as well. He deserves it."
4151,"Ok..so I never write reviews. Ever. Especially on IMDB where they kind of force you for a certain length, spoilers alert, and so on.Anyways..if you're looking for an action movie, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU. This is a piece of art. This is the best film in 2019. Or the best film I've seen in years. The acting, directing, cinematography, editing (colorist!!!), the score, the script, EVERYTHING is perfect.Joaquin Phoenix & Todd Phillips are brilliant; each of them in their own way and role. Let the Oscars come their way!!! Amazing team and film. I've seen it 2 days back, I'm still haunted by it."
4152,"As a big Batman fan, the idea of making an origin movie about his greatest foe without the hero can be easily dismissed, let alone from a man who has directed some divisive films. Mental illness is also a thorny societal issue slowly being recognized and governments everywhere are tackling. It comes to no surprise that an adaption about Joker's origin will cause controversy, possibly stirring wannabe lunatics into action, and because we see the character as evil incarnate, bereft of humanity. Seeing the film however, the truth couldn't be more different. Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix deliver a tragic and haunting portrayal of Joker's descent into madness, liberally borrowing from classics such as Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy and taking its cue from acclaimed graphic novels such as Batman: The Killing Joke and Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, while retaining core aspects of the character without glorifying his actions into a hero. Joker is without a shadow of a doubt the most unique comic book movie ever.Arthur Fleck, played by Joaquin Phoenix, is a lonely single man who lives together with his mother. Working as a party clown, he dreams of becoming a popular television comedian in the vein of his idol Murray Franklin, played by Robert De Niro. Consecutive misfortunes and tragedy, however, spiral his already broken life toward anarchy not because of a single character that prevents his personal growth, but society's ill and self-serving agenda. Phoenix is widely considered among the greatest living actors with acclaimed performances in Gladiator, Her and The Master, to name a few. Heath Ledger casts a huge shadow on the role, winning a posthumous Academy Award. Phoenix's Joker is an instant classic alongside Travis Bickle, Ledger's Joker, Alex DeLarge and other cinematic greats. The physical transformation to portray an impoverished man is immersive, drawing the viewer to Arthur on a visceral level. Few actors are willing to undergo drastic body changes from film to film, one of them being Christian Bale, the Batman of Christopher Nolan's trilogy. Before killing Randall, Arthur was doing body contortions similar to Pennywise the Clown in It, unaided by digital effects, all done by sheer physicality. The film is littered with imagery of Arthur's condition. Aside from the physicality, the laugh and mannerisms depict psychopathic narcissistic tendencies that is staple of the character for decades. Phoenix is truly terrifying at times. The best part about Arthur's characterization is how it retained the essence of Joker from the comics. Joker, in the modern age, is an unreliable narrator with multiple origins. Many scenes are actually make-believe imaginations of Arthur, such as the relationship with his neighbor Sophie and being interviewed live as an audience in Murray's talk show. In fact, the film as a whole is ambiguous, leaving open for interpretation if any of the events occurred at all in reality. What makes Joker a timeless character is ambiguity. The writing and acting perfectly captures that characterization.Joker is by a wide margin Todd Phillip's magnum opus. The direction is simply stunning. The cinematography and production design evoke a 70s or early 80s vibe visually. From the dirty streets and references to popular culture in those decades, the audience is drawn to that world while putting a modern spin about today's views on mental illness. At times, the score sounds like one composed by Hans Zimmer, but it is not. Hildur Guðnadóttir pays homage to the Nolan trilogy with her score, but in a unique way solely for Joker's world. Coupled with Phoenix's acting, the score can be heart-pounding or heart-stopping. Something jarring about the music are placements of songs that would have been better replaced by the score alone. Overall, they do not negatively affect much the film as a whole. Depicting Joker's ambiguity and unreliable narrator would not be possible without masterful editing. The film is perfectly paced that builds to a rousing and violent conclusion. There are moments of levity, such as Gary failing to open the door because of his short stature, but the biggest moments come when Arthur begins murdering people out of revenge. Without proper pacing, the film would just have been another ""excessive"" show of violence without drama.On a thematic level, the social commentary feels a bit lacking. For a film reviewed by a significant portion of the critics as excessively violent, Joker is a bit safe and tame. Surely, many other films have exceeded Joker's violence. The film is about class struggle as it is about mental illness. Gotham is a boiling pot of inequality, where the poor are relegated to shabby apartments and the rich in spacious mansions. This is exemplified by Thomas Wayne, who promises that his business acumen can elevate the city's economy as mayor. Thomas Wayne comes off very condescending and detach from the actual living conditions of his fellow citizens, although an argument could be made that is because of Arthur's view on him, not necessarily Thomas Wayne's true personality. Murray Franklin, played by Robert De Niro, is also another rich person with selfish agenda when during his talk show a video of Arthur doing stand-up comedy was played to the ridicule of his audience. Arthur is not motivated by high-minded ideals, but by revenge, thus distorting how we perceive some of the characters are. While the film excellently constructs Gotham's divided class structure, the social commentary is lacking because the supporting characters are weak and are there simply for Arthur to despise after contributing to his eventual downfall. Unlike its inspiration, Taxi Driver, which has outstanding supporting characters such as Iris, Betsy and Sport where the themes are given weight, Joker has none, although they are played decently by their actors, especially Robert De Niro. Murray's exchange with Arthur during the finale is spectacular. De Niro, a screen legend himself, holds his own against another legend at his best.Do not miss Joker in theaters!9/10"
4153,"Brilliant, provocative, deeply disturbing and truly an amazing piece of cinema. A stunning directorial work and a showcase for the inestimable talent of Phoenix. It is a must-see event for adult audiences. Bravo."
4154,"Simply flawless. Give me more joker! Would watch again. Yes, it is slow. Nothing really happens into the very end but it was all worth it for the climax. Great acting. Great story. Came out the screening feeling very happy"
4155,The movie was a great and ithink this movie will go to a many win and the hero as joker he shoud to win the oscar
4156,"JOKER is a psychological study of the character, Not your regular comic book Movie. The movie forces audience to think deeply about issues regarding morality, mental health, bullying, the rich and the society as a whole. The main focus of the movie is the mind of Arthur and how it fragments apart under the many inhumane but impactful acts of the society which when pile up brings out the Joker in Arthur. What makes this hit the core of masses, is its relatability. He's a relatable kind of villain, bullied and sad. It also depicts how mental health issues are ignored by the corporates and the suffering people become even more isolated. Joaquin Phoenix has done a phenomenal job, even just looking at his laugh in which he has masterfully depicted the hidden sorrow behind the character, makes you realize that the man has worked hours and hours just to make this perfect. Cinematography was beautiful and the soundtrack suited the storyline perfectly. Even if the movie had no relation to the Batman universe at all, it would still have worked just as great. In the end, although you can't justify the acts of Arthur, but you definitely understand them."
4157,Joaquin Phoenix act and Todd Phillips combo make suxh a great film its make you feel like there are many jokers out there and its make you feel sad for nice people treated so badly oit there
4158,"First thing come to our mind while hearing joker is heath from DK.
But this one may slightly change your priority.
Its difficult to see a new actors as joker.
But this one is totally next level."
4159,This movie was emotionally gripping and Phoenix's portrayal of joker was nothing short of outstanding.
4160,"This film was phenomenal. Engaging through out the film, not a dull moment . Has you feeling empathetic for Arthur , aka Joker, from beginning to end. It was a tad bit dark but I like how it shows the story of how he came to be. How mental illness is a big impact on your life. Joaquin truly did an exceptional job!!"
4161,"Unpopular opinion, but I think Phoenix leap frogged Ledger. This was his best performance. I'm scared the role took a toll on him mentally due to how excellently he portrayed joker. Great plot, great choice of actors and incredible sound track."
4162,"Ledger give a high standard for DC's most maniac villain, respect for him..but sorry now Joaquin give more!! His deep 'tragedy laugh' make more iconic scene in the one of best movie of this year!! PERFECT CAST AND DESERVE AN OSCAR FOR PHOENIX!! AWESOME MOVIE!! 9/10."
4163,Worth every penny and I would recommend this movie to every DC fan. Joaquin Phoenix lead us on a journey of an innocent man turning in to the Villain Batman truly deserves. Great Acting. Should definitely be nominated for Oscars and also win it
4164,"I'd say, this film is not a 10, however, it is very well made. More than just a film, i think it's a HUGE political commentary. Humanizes a villain, makes us understand ""bad"" people are just folks who hadn't the opportunities many of us have. People who are immersed in the abuse cycle, very probably is going to perpetrate it in adulthood. It is a very important message.I think it is necessary this was made. Today's times need more empathy, even if a nihilistic movie is needed for us to understand. If sad news have us in a perpetual state of numbness, maybe this will move emotions for a few people.I don't remember the last time I felt so sad, with darkness filled in my heart while watching a film. I love the fact it doesn't romanticize the violence, it is presented as tragic, and a part of a vicious cycle as I previously mentioned. I love the humanization. I love the state's part in the violence, the people's part in violence. We are an ecosystem, and we need to begin understanding it.It's deeply moving, with a few layers of commentary. The Joker per se it is not very interesting, and I'm not particularly a fan of this kind of characters, with nothing to say more than it has been already said, however, this is an exception. We have the genesis, the understanding of ""why"" the joker was made in the first place.The fact we can apply this circumstances to any criminal it's mesmerizing. It's an outcast, a sad person, a lonely person, an abused person, a poor person. When people have this kind of environment, what the hell were you expecting?"
4165,The movie turned out to be as great as expected. Mind blowing acting by Joaquin Phoenix. Oscar deserving acting.
4166,"This movie will keep you thinking for days after watching. Dark, gritty, disturbing and heart wrenching. It definitely sends a message that people need to hear about our society now. Phoenix deserves an Oscar for this performance. Just go see it.."
4167,"I was impressed when he, laughing in the same time you can see how he want to cry In the same time you see how he want to revenge from all, he must win oscar for this filme ,great filme thanks"
4168,"The controversy surrounding this film definitely lured me into the theater last night to watch it. I have to say it is a dark and gritty movie. I can understand the fears of this film inciting violence but that is not a reason to not see it. Joaquin Phoenix is Oscar worthy for his performance and I am totally blown away by this movie. I live outside of Annapolis, MD where a mass shooting took place not even 2 years ago and this movie is relevant to our social climate now more than ever. I think NOT seeing this movie is doing more damage than seeing it. It may be just my opinion but I do expect to see an Oscar nod or two."
4169,"I loved it so far this is my favorite movie this year, Joaquin must win the Oscar for best actor he was born to do it .. The sequence of events was perfectly done, the direction.. Great job congratulations to Joaquin Phoenix"
4170,You should watch this movie it's one of my favorite movies now
4171,This film captures what it can be lack for some people to live in the shadow of society and how that can make them feel. Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant definitely Oscar worthy. It borrows heavily from the king of comedy and taxi driver but applies it well to a comic book villains origin story
4172,"Joaquin absolutely nailed this performance, this is the best acting I've seen in a while (if he doesn't get an Oscar I don't know who will). The movie has a very simple premise, but is executed very well. Every scene looks like a painting and there are not many lines, but every one of them is powerful. Go watch it if you haven't!"
4173,This is the best movie this year and possibly for the whole decade
4174,"For cinema holics who wanna a 70s drama and Scorsese's films , it perfect"
4175,"The society created the joker; the joker created batman.If you are in Hong Kong, you will find this movie even more inspiring! Joker is the reflection of this hypocrite cold blooded society. I like both Phoenix version and health version joker, and this one is more realistic. What makes a person anti-social? To become sociopath? It's the society itself."
4176,"Joker is one the best movie of the year, and the best R rated fictional movie after Logan. I just watched it last night and it lived up to my expectations. I didn't disappointed or dissatisfied at all. Many critics said that this movie is so dark, bloody, violent, disturbing, inappropriate, and teasing the reality of the world we living in. But besides all that, it's just a fictional movie, and duh... It's an R rated, what did you expect. Todd Phillips has truly done a great job. Joker is the best R rated movie of the year, period."
4177,In short just give it every award that ever existed
4178,The supervillain of the batman the Joker there is some nice connection to the batman I absolutely enjoyed the movie and acting this actor phoenix that was the amazing part of the movie I have seen his movie first and I am his fan now brilliant performance.
4179,"Wonderful acting. Joaquin Phoenix is unmatchable, perfect and rare."
4180,We can easily understand how Pure Evil are born.Well planned & well played movie.
4181,"The movie Joker is by far a resounding success and for good reason. I wouldn't say it's a masterpiece of any sorts like most fans are, but it's such a well done film overall and it works really well. I loved every aspect of this story and how it led to Arthur becoming the Joker. Again, wouldn't say it's the masterpiece everyone else is claiming it to be, but it is certainly an amazing film to watch."
4182,"Perfect villain for batman, love this movie, great acting, great story"
4183,"I saw the hype. I saw the negative spin the media tried to portray the movie in. I saw the reports of the eight minute standing ovation at the screenings. I saw the review bomb attempts the Rotten Tomatoes professional critics were giving Joker. And I went and watched the movie myself. Joaquin Phoenix has created a man who had his entire life and beliefs fall apart in a week, and learn that even those closest to him never really knew him, or lied to him, or were responsible for the pain he was going through his entire life. The worst part was, they did not even care or notice what had been done to him. His story, this take on Joker, this is what creates a supervillain, a man so broken by society that his last resort is to laugh at the futility and sadness and rage that has been forced upon him."
4184,"Wow. There are few words that can describe how good this movie is. Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix deserve my standing ovation. They created such an unique movie, that's at the same time fantastic and terrifying."
4185,"I am beyond words. This movie is phenomenal. It is a masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix definitely is my favorite live action Joker. Yes more than Heath and Jack (although i really HATE comparing them). This is not your typical comic book movie. It is a character study about a man who becomes the Joker. About what it took to drive him this far. The film is dark, disturbing and masterful work of art. Its one of the most beautiful movie i've ever seen. This movie deserves an Oscar. Not just beat actor, but best score, best cinema photography, best film and of course, best director, which definitely goes to the man Todd Philips. If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get an oscar i'll riot. Believe the hype and screw the haters. Its truly beautiful. But dont just take my word for it, take all of the other 100's of positive reviews that say the same thing. I seriously wish there was a higher number than 10. This is like a 101/10. Just check it out. You won't regret it. Don't forget to smile and put on a happy face."
4186,It's a masterpiece! The director Todd Philips was right about saying that Marvel cannot make a movie like this. He reminded us what cinema is. I still couldn't find any negative things about this.
4187,"Heath Ledger's Joker was total chaos. Very smart, spontaneous and stupendously brave.
But Joaquin Phoenix's joker is a man oppressed by the heartless, careless society and broken financial system. He's born in poverty that has deprived him of his social rights.
Joaquin Phoenix has out done himself and justified the extremely high acting bar set by Heath Ledger.
Finally someone's on par with Heath Ledger and his Joker."
4188,"Even without Batman knowledge this movie is 9/10 easily. With the Easter egg knowledge it's an all timer. You root for Joker, you're terrified of Joker, and then you love him again. Joaquin's personality changes minute to minute, consequently there doesn't even need to be another character in the movie because he gives you so many with his various takes on the greatest villain ever. When you leave the theater the character follows you home."
4189,"Let's not forget who mr. j is, he is first and foremost a super villain. And super villains need to have an awesome backstory. This is exactly what the movie aced.The great thing about this movie is that it doesn't CGI itself to death (ahem marvel), that's to say this is a very grounded film, and if not for the title and subject matter this could stand as a great drama/thriller."
4190,"I don't want to overhype and ruin it for others, but this is honestly the best acting performance I've ever seen. It's not action packed like other movies about Batman or Joker, but it's still disturbing, terrifying, anxiety provoking and depressing. And that is all because Joaquin Phoenix GETS IT DONE! Go see this movie!"
4191,"The most disturbing and brilliant acting I have ever seen. Oscar winning performance!!! FYI This film is NOT light hearted or funny it cuts deep, it's disturbing and completely different- Instead of a DC action, witty, charming villain, he's ordinary with serious mental health issues."
4192,"I wont spoil it. I will say its dark and dramatic. You see a new side of him. In some ways youll kinda sympathize with the joker. IMO Phoenix makes the best version of all time. However, everyone has there on preference. So it depends on you."
4193,Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic in this film!! Oscar worthy!!!
4194,"Outstanding, phenomenal, just perfect.
I have waited for a Joker movie for years. And this did not disappoint. Todd Phillips did incredible with the movie but Joaquin Phoenix is the true star. His acting is out of this world and mesmerized me in every scene. The story telling is beautiful and maintained your attention from beginning to end. This is my favorite movie of 2019. I am honestly highly satisfied at the portrayal of Joker, the acting, and the movie itself. Phenomenal."
4195,"Amazing and thought provoking movie with a remarkable performance from Joaquin Phoenix, I was completely transfixed at certain points.
The absolute tragedy and spiral to the depths of despair of the main character were portrayed brilliantly leaving me overwhelmed with sadness and even empathy despite knowing I 'should' despise him.
The movie is beautifully shot, with a brilliant soundtrack - a real feast for the eyes and ears.
The De Niro casting was inspired, with many nods to Taxi Driver and King of Comedy.
The issues for me were around lack of development and depth of the supporting characters and plot from a fairly weak screenplay for the first hour or so.
It seemed the directors goal was often about setting up set pieces for Pheonix's (amazing) performance but that came at the expense of the overall breadth and depth of the narrative.
Definitely worth seeing, I left feeling astonished and impressed at what I had witnessed but ultimately slightly less than fulfilled."
4196,It goes without saying that Phoenix's performance was exceptional but the story itself was a little flat at times in my opinion. Nevertheless I was super anxious and tense throughout the movie and I really hope he wins best actor as he totally became the Joker.
4197,Must see 10/10. One of the best films in a long time.
4198,Don't believe the hype it's not enough. Don't expect anything as this masterpiece breaks all your expectations! This is a movie which at times makes you sick and at times shows you glimpse of the world through the Joker's eyes! One of the best DC films and after 10 years Clown takes the Crown back and sits on the throne again!!MUST WATCH FOR EVERY MOVIE LOVER!
4199,"Incredible story with an incredible performance from Phoenix. It was such a complex character to portray and I can't imagine anybody else being able to do it. I was curious to see how he would approach the character and how the troubled soul would become 'The Joker'Todd Phillips has somehow tied the story in perfectly with Bruce Wayne and his parents, whilst using the platform as a homage to other films from this era (1979?), like King of Comedy and Taxi Driver. It's both familiar and utterly unique.It's a scary portrayal of how a mentally troubled loner who is wronged by society can find comfort and their smile through dark means."
4200,This film pieces together everything you need to understand the joker and how he came to be.
4201,I can't stop thinking about this movie. What a great time!!!
4202,A movie should win oscar in every category. One of the best movie i have ever seen in decades...
4203,I am speechless this film is incredible and joaquin Phoenix preformed so good I even still think about it until this moment what an actor l loved every thin in the film the soundtracks the great acting and directing well done
4204,Oh my God I can't imagine how beautiful of this week how perfect this movie is the best movie Ever.
4205,Simply outstanding. The greatest peace of acting I've ever seen!
4206,One of the best movies I have seen in years. I love that it is a grown up version of DC and not cartoonish like so many others have been. Fingers crossed that there is a sequel that stays true to this approach.
4207,"The Joker has many origin stories, in comics, in movies or even series.
What this movie essentially does, is amplifies the best qualities that Joker offers.
It is a raw, sickening, intriguing and unsettling movie that understands what Joker is supposed to be, unpredictable, chaotic, the ebb which flows.I have so many good things to say, and literally no negativity towards this movie.
Amazing visuals, spectacular actor who portrays Joker, good music, stylish and memorable scenes.As a fan, this is everything i ever wanted. If this is your first Joker movie,
expect to be shocked, repulsed, disgusted, intrigued.
This is what Joker is, this is what joker has always been and should always be.A solid 10/10, i can't believe we live in a world where movies from DC can be this good."
4208,This is my first review ever. I have seen the movie last night and I can say it's the best movie I have seen in ages and I have seen lots of movies! I really don't understand the bad reviews!! (hence the reason I am writing one) It's a great movie with amazing cinematography and great performances from both actors de Niro and Phoenix. It's a must see! I will go to watch it again!
4209,"I can resiliently say that Joker is a movie the world needed. Most critics get carried away by political, personal and sometimes illicit influences as they review it. In this way it presents a disturbed view of masterful works. Joker touches delicate subjects in a way that is rarely seen in today's theaters. If the world can't handle a profound work like, then it means the world needs to change. And change the way we view complex social issues, which we prefer to isolate it from debate because of the high diversity of opinion. Very well built and set, Joker brings big holes that society has, and are covered."
4210,"Joaquin Phoenix has acted beautifully and mesmerising. How a sequence of bad events can make an already unstable person to full blown psychosis. The way Joaquin laughed, smiled, cried and even those intense glare he gave spoke so much emotion. It was truly magnificent seeing an actor showing the characters emotion through their eyes.
The state of how Arthur became The Joker is very well depicted.🔥🔥
This movie wasn't slow, it wasn't boring, it was building. From the opening scene to the very end.🔥🔥👏👏. Joker - For my whole life, I didn't know if I even really existed. But I do, and people are starting to notice.😎🔥
Phoenix deserve a Oscar 👏"
4211,"My review is incomplete as there is so much to discuss but i am speechless.. This is by far one of the most ""well done"" movie based on the life of a mentally ill person. You are very much instilled in the shoe of a person who has mental illness and has to face the modern day society who expect him to behave.. as if he doesn't !! For me this move is 1 step beyond another master piece called ""Memento (2000)"" which was also based on a mentally ill character. But Joker is an extensively Dark movie for a main-stream Cinema specially when he is dancing he is sending a layered message to the audience. Most of the times this movie gives you the feel of an Art Movie (more than just an action flick or superhero flick). The dark and disturbing part of this movie is sheer work of Art that too performed with utter brilliance. And last but not least, Phoenix is by far the best and most Realistic Joker ever.. for me he did a PERFECT job of not only Joker but also a mentally ill person.. Perfect expression, laughter and dialogue delivery .. In the End Please NOTE: that when i said 'mentally ill' i meant a person Not Fit for modern day hypocrite Society : )"
4212,One of the best movies I ever seen. Felt real cause a great storyline and actors
4213,"This film is a work of art. It revolutionises the way stories should be told. The message conveyed by the movie very strong, but doesn't apply in modern society. Its not a superhero movie. If you categorise it as a superhero movie its one of the best ever made. If you categorise it as a drama its one of the best ever made. It's one of the best in every genre including comedy. If you can't go to theatre, pirate it. That's what the joker wants."
4214,Outstanding presently facts of joker about his lifecycle from good to bad transition!
4215,"Don't go into this movie thinking that it's going to carry the same tone as the dark knight. This movie goes much further than that, and brings an even more realistic approach to the character and this world. The comic book ""feel"" is completely absent from the film and that, I think, is what makes this movie so unique. A cautionary tale telling society to GET. IT'S. ACT. TOGETHER."
4216,"Joaquin Phoenix has done the unthinkable, and has created a character within himself which is both terrifying and twisted. A truly amazing performance as the clown.Take a bow, Joaquin"
4217,"One more masterpiece for the DC movies. Joaquin Phoenix deserves for sure his oscar and Todd Philips did an amazing job not only as a director but also as a writer. I fully recommend this movie to all the fans of the dark knight and to those who love character development and interesting dialogues and quotes and generally movies that keep you thinking hard for weeks. So it is important to remember that this Joker is a different version of the character and so you should not hope for another 2008-Joker. Moreover, it is not a Nolan movie and so its main theme and focus are different from the Dark Knight since Joker is a drama-thriller movie. And this is the reason why it is such an unique film-masterpiece. Finally, it is one of the most interesting movies I have ever watched."
4218,Best DC movie I've ever seen. Hopefully they stick to this R rated dark path
4219,"Superb! Joaquin Phoenix's performance is Oscar-worthy. If you like comics and the trend of comic book movies, do not miss it and judge for yourself."
4220,Didn't feel like comic book adaption but like film about Arthur whose in deep trouble with his illness and diffiucult life and world around him.
4221,"Great study of one twisted character. Best performance of great Joaquin.
Go see it for yourself"
4222,"The best film of the year!
Great acting, I love getting the Jokers perception and backstory. Not just as a caricature but an actual person.
Recommend 👍"
4223,A clown boy performing great as a boy clown! If I wore socks to the cinema they'd have been blown off
4224,"It's not a tragedy, it's a sad yet thrilling comedy."
4225,"I've always believed in Joaquin Phoenix's talent and he only needed two movies to prove that but in this, he completely transfigured into Joker. Todd Phillips and Scott Silver we're forever in your debt."
4226,"There is a danger to this film.An origin story, sure. But a warning about how society, friends and family can slowly wear away at a person - and how there's no time taken by anyone to understand anyone who is struggling, is different, who's 'failing'.Like driving and parenting, those who are poor at these things, seldom realise just how bad they are. With social responsibility and awareness, people are just the same. Everyone thinks they're good. Posted that suicide awareness meme? Tick. I'm a solid human being. Then post a video of that weirdo on the bus.The film has divided many. I suspect that those who've not enjoyed it are those with little empathy or those lucky enough not to have an ignored struggle to cope with. Certainly not adrift from society, or failing to 'achieve' (urgh). It's quite likely the film's closing line was a predictor of those reactions. I was the only one laughing at this and a few other moments.Phoenix cuts through his character's psyche here more than Joker does any victim. He breathes and cries loneliness. There are several moments which openly show his struggle to join in with a world he doesn't fit into. He waltzes through these and more, pulling you on-side and deeper and deeper. And I felt it. Very much.And that's where it could be dangerous. A potential call to arms.But above all, it's a remarkably engrossing piece, linking as much with King Of Comedy as with the Batman story. Drawing the links between the two worlds into focus too, and forcing us to question our ignorance and to challenge known truths.Phoenix will win Best Actor for this. Rightly so."
4227,"Oscar deserving performance. Great story telling, great score, great screenplay, full of suspense and goosebumps."
4228,"The best performance i have ever seen by an actor,period..I really felt concerned that Phoenix really lost it and went insane..His expressions his laugh his reactions everything that he does makes you forget that he is acting and that he really suffers from some disease ..Despite this absolute oscar winning masterpiece of a performance though,there is also a very strong plot that builds slowly step by step helped by the really beautifully dark cinematography that makes it even more appealing .The second star of this film after Phoenix,for me at least, is the soundtrack..It bounds his creepy performance,its dark cinematography and its terrific plot in the most disturbing way,making the film so powerfully depressing that it gets to you..I leave the violence thing for the end,because many things have been heard and written.We're talking about Joker and DARK DC in an R-rated movie,what did they expect ? Flowers and sunshine ? There are movies out there that are even more violent but in the end,none of them is as violent as the real world that we live in."
4229,"We need a sequel of this phenominal origin story of the darkest villian ever.
Hats off to Todd's direction and the performance by Joaquin is breathtaking. This is best acting directing combo I have seen in recent years.
The cinematography is so beautiful that's I got completely hooked.
And making it R-Rated did the complete justice to this movie. We wouldn't grasp the darkness of Joker's character if it wouldn't be an R-Rated.
Some might argue that it's depressing. That's because the acting and the story is so amazing.
I was shocked that the movie is about a villain and I was feared that without a hero. It won't have to show but the character development of Arthur to Joker is really an amazing journey.
Besides, some scenes are so intense that you won't move your eyes from the screen.
The music was also wonderful and dark ofcourse.
Joker is spoussed to be the most dark, psychopathic, terrified, and weirdest villain. And Joaquin's Joker went beyond from all these villainous characteristics.
I truly hope that WB must think about making a spin-off series of Joker."
4230,"Perfection at it's finest
this will be recorded in history"
4231,"So excellent!!! I can't believe that Joaquin's character was so amazing. So real. I really thought that Joaquin was a crazy guy.
Oscar pls comeeee"
4232,"In this adaptation of Joker, one of the greatest villain of all time in history, Joaquin Phoenix delivers a magnificent and unforgettable performances as a madman driven into insanity.There has been multiple portrayals of the Joker, and all of them has done the character justice, however, Joaquin Phoenix's Joker has beaten all that had come before him. I used to think that it will be near impossible to surpass Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight, but this one did. Seeing the commitment Phoenix has for this character really moved me and I believe, after many nominations, this will be where he will finally receive the Oscar.As for the story, it was good but I think it could be better. I was hoping for it to be darker and grittier. The story was depressing, but I wanted it to be even more depressing, so much that it was intolerable. Still, director Todd Phillips has done a great job for a drama film and I hope to see more of this genre from him in the future. The tone and color of the film is also wonderful, and the cinematography is exceptional.All in all, the film is fantastic and the performance from Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely phenomenal. A must-watch!"
4233,"One of the best performances seen in recent cinema, Joaquin Phoenix has done an amazing job. Brilliant movie."
4234,"I went to the premier in my hometown, I've always gone to movie's premiers, and there is always clapping by the people at the end of the film, this wasn't the case. After the movie finished, everyone remained in their places, speechless, did not know what to do, what to say. I had the same reaction. This movies is impactful, deep, strong, and obviously has an Oscar-winning acting by Joaquin Phoenix. Days after seeing the movie, I'm still thinking about the movie."
4235,"Excellent casting, wonderful directing. A lot of thought has clearly gone into every scene. Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal. Music works well. All in all, a very good piece, yet not your average comic book adaptation.To those saying there's too much Joaquin in it: this is a character study and much of what we see is through Arthur's eyes.
To those commenting on Joaquin overdoing it: he plays a mentally unstable character, yet manages to portray every feeling in a believable way.
To those complaining there is too much drama, too little Joker specific mayhem: this is the becoming of.
To those saying it's depressing: yes, living with a mental illness is depressing. And no, society does't do much to help. (Do you never see impaired people being ridiculed in real life?)
To those commenting on how Gotham is dark: why was there a need for Batman, remind me?For the critics: get over yourselves."
4236,"I was expecting so much from this film but it surpassed that expectation
phoenix goes so much further with and deeper into the character
dont believe the hype - its so much better than all the praise thats been heaped upon the film
10 STARS"
4237,"This film shows the human side of the Joker, the mental illness, not being acepted by the society and being humiliated. He is raised with traditional values and has deep connections with his mother who inspired him to make people laugh as his life mission.
Is the Joker the misfit or the society we are living in has lost its ways, looking down to care of older people and focusing on seeing only the deviations from the standard way of behaving, standard way of talking and standard way of dressing and looking like.
In the beginning the Joker thought his life is a tragedy, in the end he understood it is a comedy."
4238,"A phenomenal film focusing on a man and his spiral through life and society and what that does to him. Inspired in part by 'The Killing Joke' with the focus around 'one bad day can drive anyone mad' we get to watch the amazing Phoenix spiral from unstable into pure madness. Throughout this process you will empathise and despise this character, yet be at the edge of your seat through every moment and corner on this spiral.An academy award winning performance without a doubt with many deeper concepts that critics and audiences will uncover over time after many viewings.A film and performance that will be studied for years to comes"
4239,"I was considered late for Joker. Has been two days since premiere, spoilers are everywhere and I dodged them like bullets on the battlefield. Stayed in the 9.4 before on the IMDb, not a single thing I dare to read or hear about Joker. I did not wish to ruin my moments with a masterpiece. But I still kept my expectation steady, not to mess up like before.
But, this is truly a masterpiece! Crazy and insane. I was awed for the entire movie. The movie itself is a spectacular solo performance of Joaquin Phoenix. Robert De Niro did support well, but the entire spotlight was Joaquin's. I bet next year Oscar will be his. Who can beat this kind of insanity?
The music score gave a great boost to the movie, it was dark and intense, sent chills down to the spine. The director, also scriptwriter, Todd Philips, another brilliant factor that perfecting this gem. Succesfully delivered how sick and rotten of the Gotham's humanity. Beautiful pictures and cinematography. No scene was wasted.
Spoiler alert : My favourite scene was when Joker standing on the car, using his blood, drew a smile on his face. If you feel me too.
People tend to compare Marvel and DC. For this Joker, nothing comparable actually. It is a different thing. Can't even consider this as a superhero movie. It is a psychological thriller.
Is it merely hype?
No, it is Art (hur).
Me : 10/10"
4240,"From start to finish, amazing! Very captivating as it tells a unique take of a reboot. This is the movie of 2019! Wow, just wow!"
4241,"After falling out of love with the Marvel & DC universes and now pretty much giving up on all super hero movies altogether, I was apathetic when the ads for Joker first appeared in my local cinema. I looked at my 16 year old son, who loves watching movies too, and we both shared the same thought: ""yeah whatever""....But as the trailer rolled, it started to look interesting. Then I checked facebook, and friends who had seen the trailer too were talking excitedly. Someone said ""in Marvel they take a human and give him superpowers, here we have the opposite, a man who has everything taken away from him"" and that really resonated with me.This is one of the most important movies of our time, starring one of the most important actors of our time, the incredible Joaquin Phoenix, who has blazed a trail of cinematic excellence for many years and who's career, I think, culminates to huge climax here in this film.It's dark, dark, dark. So damn gritty and real the camera work gives us this filthy downtrodden vision of Gotham and city on the brink of self destruction. No one flys or has a special suit there are no superpowers, or laser beams, there is just a man being spat out by the system, which is run by the rich for the rich and is becoming increasingly greedy and selfish. Included in this system is the Wayne family, who despite whatever their intentions actually are, are presented here as little more than white over privileged rich people who live in a huge gated house with private security. Yeah whatever Bruce but did you ever really spend time in the ghetto?This is the commentary and Joker is trying, he's really trying to absorb the hate and the crap and the downright hardship that life is throwing at him, but he lacks the presence of mind to do it quite literally, struggles with an insane urge to laugh all the time even when things are absolutely not funny and of course the rest is history.I hope this doesn't spoil it for you, go and watch it, that's 2 hours of your life you will want to repeat."
4242,I have never seen this kind of movie. Absolutely stunning movie. I had goosebumps on my arm for last minute of scene. Just worried that actor might have mentally pain after this movie.
4243,This joker is dark excellent cinematography good plot phoenix's act is phenomenal men give this men Oscar
4244,"I tend not to get hyped about movies anymore, but after reading the reviews here I kinda was. And I wasn't disappointed, the acting, the writing, the messages, all are amazing."
4245,"Movie of the year! Actor of the year!
Thank you for the best Joker character portrayal I've ever seen."
4246,"That's it....brilliant film..acting off the scale..the taxi driver of our generation, Oscar worthy performance...menacingly beautiful."
4247,If you like freakish humour you will love this film the great acting and well planned out scenes creates a sick but funny dark humour.
4248,"I refused to watch Suicide Squad as I thought Heath Ledger had nailed the Joker. I'm back to square one now, it's going to take an amazing trailer for me to entertain watching another Joker movie."
4249,"If watching this film was a game of chess, you'd be playing against an opponent who won the game before it even started. No matter how you defend your king, your opponent outmaneuvers you and penetrates your emotional defenses every step of the way. Other directors should take notes because this is character study drama at its finest.While some will say it moved too slowly, I personally feel it was paced perfectly given the content; a slow-bleeding, 'death by a thousand cuts' delivery, which gradually ramps up over the course of the entire film. The juxtaposition of humor and despair had my emotions on a tilt-a-whirl throughout, and was accompanied by a soundtrack that complemented the themes very well.I highly recommend watching this one at least once, but steel yourself because it packs quite a punch."
4250,"Let me just say that no, the praise everyone has heard about this before it released was not the usual overhyping of a movie from critics at festivals, it was 100% deserved, I completely understand why it got an 8 minute standing ovation at Venice and yes, I did clap when this movie ended, and so did the packed audience at the theatre I went to.I mean, can you blame me? From the minute ""Joker"" starts you are glued to the screen, I literally did not avert my gaze for a second. Joaquin Phoenix gives probably the best performance of his life (and that's saying something) and definitely deserves an Oscar nomination.The story, even though a tad predictable, is amazingly written, full of great moments, both funny and dramatic and really shows
us why Arthur Fleck decides to turn into the homicidal maniac that is the Joker.Overall this is probably my favourite comic-book movie of all time, if not just my favourite movie of all time, the way Todd Philips directed his feature is astonishing, I mean this movie looks sooooo good and I, for one, cannot wait to see what he does in the future.A+"
4251,I was very skeptical about the film going in. But Phoenix won me over. It was a commanding performance and an up close look at mental health. Thank you Mr Phoenix for living up to Heath Ledgers legacy.
4252,"Everything was on point. I was not surprised by Phoenix's performance, because he is always terrific. I was in love with the way cinematography was put there. You just can see scenes that are so unique and art that you'd want the movie to stop there. Joker is the best movie I have seen in 2019 so far and an Oscar worthy nominee."
4253,"Yep! I will need to see this at least once again to fully understand how great it was. I don't think I have seen such deep dive into insanity since a good while. As the story slowly unfolds a very unsettling sensation took hold of me because I ashamedly realised I sympathise with Arthur Fleck and his actions. The cinematography is purely superb and finally I have seen a new colour palette that wasn't repeated a thousand times. There were so many potentially iconic scenes that will become memes and film history, that on its own makes this movie worthy of appraisal. I'd love to see how Joaquin Phoenix went inside the head of the Joker, because he definitely studied symptoms of insanity in depth. So many great things been already said about this film, I won't repeat those. The last 20 minutes of the film is freaking intense and when the Joker finally let all his will to pretend to be sane go, you will witness an unparalleled transformation that's not going to be forgotten or topped by anyone in our lifetime. There were so many moments in Fleck's life when he could have been helped or stopped, but society just didn't care for him. Hunted, bullied, despised, ridiculed and ultimately lied to by everyone including his closest relatives...no wonder he became the Joker. I am so happy this movie could happen in this time and age of ultra sensitivity and its reception is so overwhelming. In the diarrhoea of degenerate Disney flicks here we have a movie that will make people think and talk about it for hours on end. And finally f..k the Oscar for Best Movie, this movie already won the most significant award in Venice where real cinematic art is awarded not the best money making scheme. Joaquin Phoenix deserves the Oscar for Best Actor of 2019. Nothing I have seen this year touches his performance...not a thing! Oh, the soundtrack. How could I not mention the heart wrenching score by the Icelandic cello artist and composer Hildur Gudnadottir?! Anyone remembers the subway scene and then the following impromptu dance in the toilet with that amazing score in the background? That's called perfection!👍🏻"
4254,"It's outstanding performance from Joaquin,this movie make feel the pain it's just amazing performance and after all this year Joaquin will win Oscar"
4255,This is probably the best joker adaptation we will ever get and Joaquin Phoenix does a terrific job of playing this character he knocks it's out of the park.
4256,Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely superb in this film. I'm not exaggerating when I say this; it's the best acting I have ever seen. He adopts the character like I have never seen before.The film is very dark and twisted and extremely clever. Quite a hard watch at times. The laughing is harrowing!
4257,"Stunning acting by phoenix. He really is legend. Story, acting cast every thing is just perfect. will go and watch again and again."
4258,"'Joker' is all about a man being pushed down all the way until he finally snaps. And mind you, by 'Snap' I do not mean - 'to give up'. When a man snaps, he is oblivious to all boundaries of morality and righteousness - which brings us to the very transition of Arthur Fleck to 'The Joker'. This movie describes why 'The Joker' was created in the first place. It is not a typical DC movie in which there is a certain motive that has to be fulfilled by the protagonist or the antagonist concerned and this is why I believe, it stands out. Overly critical viewers might be a tad disappointed regarding the plot of the movie because - simply put, this movie has no plot. It is definitely not an origin story since the director has taken a completely new take on the character. We don't see Arthur Fleck drowning in a tank of boiling chemicals only to emerge as a completely psychotic individual whose sole objective is to watch the world burn.Rather we see a man being thrown into an utterly bullish society devoid of any empathyThe man is bullied to such an extent that he doesn't even consider his life to be a tragedy anymore. And as Arthur puts it plainly - ""All my life I didn't even know I existed, but now I do and people are starting to notice""The moment he snaps he finally realises that his life was a comedy - a joke. A killing one. Not one, being killed.'Joker' is a beautiful movie. Not because it attempts to discover a completely new aspect of the world's most iconic villain of all time but because it successfully justifies ""The Joker's"" perspective in front of the audience to the point at which the audience is compelled to cheer for everything the joker does. The movie brainwashes its audience who were already finicky about it.
A man being pushed down to such an extent that all he has to lose - is nothingAnd boy has Joaquin Phoenix delivered an absolute masterpiece. He is a brilliant actor and has justified it over and over again with his movies. But, just like Heath Ledger, he was born to play 'The Joker' and I am glad his decision hasn't taken a toll on his mental health. ""The Joker"" is a character who thrives in pandemonium. He is a sergeant of mayhem and to do justice to his character is an improbable task for any actor. But Phoenix is not an ordinary actor. If you have seen, 'You Were Never Really Here' you would probably understand why Joaquin was cast as the Joker. He somehow understands what a 'broken man' means - primarily because he himself had struggled immensely for the vast majority of his life. He has carried Heath Ledger's legacy forward and we deserved it. We have waited for over a decade for it.
It would be criminally unjust to assert that Joaquin betters Heath as ""The Joker"" because both of them had different roles albeit the same character, but entirely separate storylines to follow. Heath Ledger's Joker was all about watching the world burn but Nolan's movie provided no specific backdrop to his character. All we knew was - he had a drunk and abusive father. Joaquin's Joker also wants to watch the world burn but his movie justifies his stance. The latter one succeeds in connecting with the audience while the former, leaves the audience speechless with his persona and his meticulous acts of complete madness all the while providing match up for his greatest nemesis - The Batman.
We don't see the intelligence or the brilliantly thought out plans of ""The Joker"" in this movie. The movie is more of a character study which is glorified by its actors. Joaquin Phoenix wins the Oscar for the Best Actor's Award for the ""Joker"". Yes you read it first here. The movie conveys a message. Probably an important one but the way it has been carried out is wrong because of course - ""The Joker"" is a villain. You know, the bad guy who does bad stuff like mass murdering and carrying out bomb blasts. But then again, Joaquin Phoenix's excellence makes you oblivious to all of that. I am a massive ""Joker"" fan, I'll tell you that and I wanted Arthur to snap as quickly as possible and boom! Become the Joker and do the badass stuff. But believe me, Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal is so strong and unreal that the audience is bound to connect with his character. It is as if you root for him to not snap. You feel uncomfortable when his colleagues bully him and you feel equally betrayed when he discovers the truth about his delusional mum. I still remember this one time, when the audience in the Hall cheered and hooted for ""The Joker"" when he went up to the talk show host and shot him dead. Such was the strength of Joaquin's performance that it compelled the audience to cheer for the worst sin a man could carry out.
""Joker"" is a masterpiece. You have read it hundreds of times and you read it again here. You go to the theatre expecting nothing because you probably know it has nothing to do with the DCEU, but when you come out, you somehow develop a soft spot for the most infamous comic book villain of all time. And all of this is credited to Joaquin Phoenix's performance.Starting from the iconic ""Joker"" laugh to an evident insanity in his eyes, everything good about his performance is a major plus for this movie. He carries the movie all along and he is present with his mesmerizing persona in each and every frame of it. The audience loves ""The Joker"". The more you give him to them, the better the movie becomes. That's how you win the critics -> Warner Bros."
4259,"Its just amazing.
And yeah it's not for children and marvel"
4260,"It's obvious I would say this movie is amazing, it gave me some feels this and that, but guys, pls don't let this movie diminish it's rating to 8, of all the movies that came out from 2010 to 2019, at least one should be 9/10, Endgame tried, almost succeeded, now let's leave Joker 9/10 pls"
4261,"Now I get the hype. There are two sides to this movie. Firstly, this feels like more than a film. It's an indictment of our ineffectiveness in addressing the mental illness in our society today. The dark places so many people are falling into with no lifeline to get out.
The other side is the incredible achievement of art. Rare is it today that Hollywood has flushed out the why and how of a character that we are placed right in the passenger seat of this speeding out of control vehicle of a film with no way to hit the brakes, and we don't want to. A front row seat to the building of madness and it's beautiful. The locations and production design are only topped by the cinematography. From the shot of a badly beaten Arthur to him emerging from a dark hall into the light of Day is breathtaking all the way to the end. A fantastic achievement that deserves all the accolades I'm sure it will garner."
4262,You need to give a 10 for this movie because of the performance of Joaquin Phoenix.
4263,"Incredible story, amazing film, and well written definitely a top contender for an oscar. To the people that think it glorifies violence, please for the love of god just go see the film and come to a decision yourself. You won't be disappointed."
4264,"It's a great film, very powerful. Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips should both get Oscars. End of story."
4265,"It's my first ever review so it ll be very short. In one line all i can say is ""MUST WATCH""A brilliant new take on the Crown price of Crime. The movie is dark, gritty and makes you very uncomfortable whilst questioning our understanding of morals about black, white and grey. Joaqin Phoenix just blew it out of the park. On par with Ledger's performance. Must watch !!"
4266,Critics can go suck jokers di*k cuz its the best film in 2019
4267,"Heavy! It is one of those pieces that come around every so often and makes you take a deep look @ yourself. This is not a wild and fun version of the character. This is an introspective take into mental illness and how we as a people choose to relate to it. You will leave this movie ashamed or proud of how you relate to others. Fantastic acting. Fantastic setting. Emotional to say the least. Is Phoenix's rendition of #TheJoker superior to Heath's, it's not inferior. #movies #moviecritic"
4268,Pure magic it's the best movie to depict a descend into madness
4269,"This is the best DC movie since the dark knight (part 2) and you can consider it prequel to batman begins
Great performance from phenix to joker character development from a regular mentally unstable person to the most famous criminal in the world which is completely different story from what ledger gave us as you can consider joker movie is the answer of the question: how could any human be the joker ?
And the very first moment of this human as the joker then you watch ledger present the joker in his prime after mastering criminal methods and have his followers
Joker along side batman begins and the dark knight gave us a great saga and if DC want more glory thy can make one or two more movie to complete what could happen in the future of the dark knight between batman and joker to make historical saga can compete with infinity saga and Star Wars"
4270,"This is more like mystic river, primal fear, higher learning or crash than a typical superhero movie. The acting was great. Maybe Oscar worthy. The movie kept me glued to my seat. It is too unnerving. I can't decide whether to pity or despise the Joker. He's crazy, but most people in Gotham are no saints.
I'm glad I did not take my 14 year old daughter to watch it, though. It's PG15, but it must have been just shy of getting an R.
Why the 8 instead of a10? Because I try to avoid movies this strong and stressing. I feel I was tricked into watching it. It's a great movie of the kind I'd almost rather not have watched."
4271,"Joker is amazing, film is unique and creative, music is wonderful and the story is a poetic masterpiece, Joaquin Phoenix Is surely going to take a oscar to his home"
4272,"Saw it this Afternoon, was really good film to see but however tho, I won't recommend parents taking their children to see it! Joaquin Phoenix getting praised on his performance as Arthur Fleck/ Joker! You should check this film out, don't you forget it!"
4273,"This movie is amazing in every way. Joaquin Phoenix really nailed the role as the crazy, psychotic Joker. He was the perfect actor for this role and without him the movie would not be the same. The story is very good and well-written, and a lot of people seem to agree with me. Everyone should definitely take the chance to go watch it while it's still in theaters. Don't listen to the bad reviews, most of them expected this movie to just be another superhero vs villain movie where the Joker is just a boring old villain with a clown's face. No, this is not one of those films. This is a much darker, more original villain movie that focuses on the problems in our society. So, go watch the movie in theatres while you still can!"
4274,"Go see it. Best movie ever. Brilliant acting, chemistry, character development, direction, sound, etc. Dark and gritty. No other movie is like this. See it, then see it again."
4275,"The greatest movie in this year. I think joaquin phoenix deserve the oscar.
Don't miss the movie"
4276,Joaquin pheonix has done it again. The cinematography was really amazing. Soundtrack was soothing. One of the best movies I've seen since a long time.
4277,"Amazing you must whatch the movie
10/10 i really m wont a battman and joket movie"
4278,"Masterpiece ..Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips gave us a gift... Unpredictable storyline and really deep Joaquin teach u what is really acting means.
The movie went beyond my expectations, so many emotions went through me those couple of hours.
Joker is dark and you will fall in love with the villain as you should..soundtracks,❤frank Sinatra❤, acting, directing and screenplay piece of art.
His laugh, his movements and his slow transformation from Arthur Fleck to Joker..Anybody who's watching this film has to appreciate how Phoenix committed himself to this role, he deserves every acting award possible ,Oscars winner definitely"
4279,"I really like this movie, this amazing, this not a convencional comic movie, the movie only take a comic book character, one of the best villain, and write a drama history, arthur fleck that think his life is not relevant and trasforn his madness in a simbol of villaness for gotham city poor people"
4280,Well what can I say that hasn't been said already! I just got back from seeing it and I have to say nearly the whole film I was on the edge of my seat! It's so tense! The performances are all amazing and joaquin phoenix portrayal of the Joker was astonishing! I can't praise it enough! Don't go into this film thinking it will be like a normal comic book film cause it wont! This is an adults Comic book (infant i wouldn't even think of it as a comic book adaptation) This is a Joker I've waited to see for a very long time! GO AND SEE JOKER NOW!!
4281,"This movie was beyond sensational. Had all the makings to make it feel like a completely standalone film, you find yourself forgetting it's apart of the Gotham Universe.The plot progression didn't tire for a single moment, and unlike many films where there's a scene that could have been left out, not a second of this film felt unnecessary.The cinematography took my breath away at times, and the score was moving to say the absolute least.Outstanding acting, Joaquin created a brand new joker to fall in love, incomparable to previous Jokers - not necessarily better or worse, just incomparable. He has created a Joker we have never seen before."
4282,"Joker is not only Oscar worthy for Joaquin Pheonix's stunning performance but also the well written and directed story that is brought to the big screen. I thought all the hype was ridiculous and the movie was overrated but after watching it, I consider it to be one of the best films of all time. A film has never gripped me with such an emotional experience by maintaining the perspective of the disturbed Arthur Fleck from start to finish."
4283,What a Masterpiece !!! Joaquin Pheonix showed the side of Joker we have never witnessed. A unique take on the Joker passing thru all the madness and what a Performance. Too Damn Good.
4284,"A great, raw pic describing the origins of the Joker. Although, the homage is greater to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' than to any Batman movie.A visceral exploration of mental illness and a deep character study facilitated by an emotional and convincing performance by Phoenix.Overall, very much enjoyed the original take, aided by cohesive storytelling and fantastic performances. Only detracting factor was homage sometimes swayed into plagiarism with remarkable similarities to Taxi Driver. While the film felt like a win for original storytelling it may also have been another victim to Hollywood's plague of remakes and sequels masked by a thin vineer of apparent uniqueness .Worthwhile watch in 2019!"
4285,"Amidst all the controversy and thoughtless comments from its director that threaten to overshadow the film itself, Joker is a brutally pointed and thrilling film that seeks to deviate from the comic book mold, all the while staying religiously true to its trademark qualities.though it is, in parts, ladened with the overbearing need to fulfill the requirements for an inevitable franchise (see: some of the thomas wayne arc), Joker is an intriguing character study that actually scratches the thematic surface so-to-speak, glossing its plot over with a depth that many comic book films struggle for.and at its core is the clown himself! if Heath Ledger's Joker was a portrait of a psychopath standing out in a society that was conceptually good, then Joaquin Phoenix's take on the role is a victim borne of the very perversion that he seeks to revenge. Phoenix is chilling and nuanced, capping his performance off with an odd innocence that is terrifyingly memorable.much of the criticism garnered by the film is well-deserved, as its thought-provoking message begins to get lost in the violence in the third act. it is, after all, a super hero flick. but the quick need to dismiss the film is wholly unwarranted. Arthur Fleck doesn't even become Joker until the final half-hour of the film - for the majority of its runtime, he is a broken man living in a society that's failed him.its overall commentary is poignant and rich, maybe even a little too on the nose, and it begins to get needlessly gruesome as Todd Phillips (his direction being the weakest aspect of the film by the way) strives to drive home his point. whether it serves as a source of empathy for mass murderers or not is a matter of subjectivity, though i agree that the violent end-all approach it takes cripples its overall effect. nevertheless, Joker is a solid film that shows that comic book films can have meaning."
4286,"As I was leaving the Theater I had a multitude of thoughts, a slew of emotions, and a grinning smile across my face. Joaquin Phoenix did a fantastic job, expressing many complex emotions through a broken character, a character you begin to feel sorry for as people make fun of him, beat him down, and disregard him as a person.It's oddly relatable, yet terrifying as the movie goes on. Arthur Fleck carries the screen with this aura of a broken man that thinks like a child yet looks like an adult. You can't take take your eyes off the screen seeing this awkward outcast being beaten down, it's an evil pressure that builds over time.You actually wish for him to succeed even when he resorts to violent murder upon the people who make fun of him, while throughout the film Arthur brutally kills five people, which one of them consists of a brutally terrifying stabbing upon one of his ex-coworkers, and another of him snuffing his own mother with a pillow.Concerning the depressing nature of this movie, and the political uproar it has caused. I think, It's all needed, it belongs, and it does justice. So much so, that it doesn't feel like a DC Movie, and weirdly enough I think that helps it? I can't exactly pin-point why, but many people say this film could've been it's own thing but I just don't think it would've been as good as it was, on that note I can't explain why this combo works so well but I guess the more people who talk about it, the more praise it will get!Concerning the soundtrack of this movie, it's MESMERIZING! It's creepy, and I love the way it builds suspense when you don't know what will happen next. Hildur Gudnadottir really did our ears justice, even the songs scattered through the movie were perfectly presented, I personally enjoyed ""White Room"" by Cream a lot when he was in the back of that squad car watching the riots around him, just to finally see Arthur looking happy at all of the chaos he influenced. Truly did put a smile on my face.Concerning the look of this movie, it's beautifully sweet in a gritty dirty way. To Arthur's makeup, to the clown masks people wore. The colors really pop and I love the way they shot this movie, great camera work and not a boring part of this 2 hour film. Really well paced.On the note of it being compared to Taxi Driver, I couldn't agree more. I had the same thought when I left the theater, and I personally think the Joker had more of an excuse to do the violent things he did, even if it was wrong. In Taxi Driver I felt like the main character just wanted to kill someone just to have his life known, or have purpose.In Joker's defense, his life is miserable and everyone around him including the people on television make fun of him. All of his physiological problems, mixed with his uncontrollable painful sounding laugh is sad. He decides to kill himself on Live Television as his finale, to end his miserable purposeless existence in a cruel hating world... And finally when he thinks he'll get a break, the plan changes as his final joke was messed up and ridiculed to be not funny.Even though he was a sad clown, he truly made me laugh when he was finished, That's Life."
4287,"Stunning movie!Let's give Joaquin a huge applaude, he delivered one of the hardest roles in history a mesmerizing and amazing performance, this is something that we will remember for years! Heath ledger would be proud. Much darker version than I'd expected, the movie definitely reached my expectations, with the realistic, dark and gore joker. They finished the loose ends and made us realize how ""joker"" was made, all of the physicality and emotional depth that triggered Arthur Fleck's inner joker was stunning and pure. A role to remember!!"
4288,"Amazing film. Joaquin Phoenix' performance was second to none. Gritty, sometimes hard to watch but beautiful. The best film I've seen in years."
4289,"JOKER is the best film of the year. Best experience of my life, this stunning movie demands a multiple viewing, you don't know what's real and what's not. JOKER is an experience inside JOKER mind and you feel like you in it. Joaquin Phoenix is going to win the best leading actor, and the cinematography and the music score are awesome they will be nominated or win oscars for their hard work, I seeing from now, this is going to win the best picture not only gets nominated but win. JOKER is a must see."
4290,"#Joker is Perhaps the movie of the century. Joaquin Phoenix is beyond a legend. Every second of this period drama is exhilarating. His emotions , his demeanour , His body type - everything was executed to perfection.Heath ledger would be proud of his replacement.Todd Phillips - the writer and director has made an absolute masterpiece.The film itself is essentially a prequal to the Dark Knight or to be specific the very birth of Batman.His depiction of the classic villain touches upon more than what meets the eye - dealing with societal pressures , mob mentality and
Class disparity all in a very late 60's early 70's era.This movie has the defining scene of Thomas Wayne and his wife being killed in a riot in the dark alley all in front of young Bruce.
This put a lot of the back story into context for future confontrations if and when Batman learns all this.Warner Bro's has created an anti hero blockbuster to bring them right back into contention against the recent Marvel onslaught.Ps : Robert DeNiro's cameos quite fun. Trust me wait for the end.*Spoiler Alert*"
4291,This movie is one of the best DC movies ever created a must watch Heath Ledger would be proud of such an amazing performance by Phoenix.
4292,"Todd Phillips provides us with the masterful child of ""Taxi Driver"" and ""The King of Comedy"". The inspirations from both are clear throughout, but Joker manages to make a name for itself. Hildur Guðnadóttir's phenomenal score provided a symphony for Arthur's crude yet hypnotic dancing and inspired emotion and darkness when you least expected it. The powerhouse of the movie was the lead actor. Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Arthur Fleck's descent into udder madness is astonishing. His weight loss, the sunken cheeks, and the greased hair, not to mention the laugh creates this persona of a deranged loner. Any time Joaquin would laugh due to his condition, there was an atmosphere change in the theatre. Everyone felt the power, the fear, and the anger behind it and it was truly captivating. The way he twists and turns his body in his never ceasing attempts to be liked or normal leaves you uneasy. You finally see the beauty in his madness as he dances down his very own stairway to heaven to the sound of ""Rock and Roll Part 2"". Amidst his aggressive, celebratory, and almost jubilant thrusting he's ushered into his rebirth into anarchy. De Niro was a phenomenal counterpart to Phoenix, and was part of the homage to the previous Scorsese movies. De Niro was subtle, while also providing a believable and comical idol. The final showdown between the two while expected, leaves you shocked by De Niro's alarming death. However, the movie comes to true fruition near the end. As Joker stands on top of the wrecked police car and turns his blood into the smile whilst the crowd cheers and riots. In this scene where Arthur stands in victory and everything has come together you can't help but cheer for him. This movie has reimagined the Joker into an iconic antihero, and it will be interesting to see where it goes from here."
4293,"You know a movie is great when the majority of the ratings are 1 or 10 stars. Obviously based off the 9.2 it's got a lot more 10's than 1's and there's a good reason for that.Those who gave this one star are either one of two things:1. Marvel cultists who will bash anything DC ever does.
2. People that went to this movie expecting it to be the usual cookie cutter superhero movie that is watered down in order to pander to both children and men...Anyways... You will either hate or love this movie. I don't believe there is an in between. It is provocative, vile, dark, and occasionally hard to watch, but aren't all the greatest movies?These are all elements of the world around us and we cannot just pretend like they don't exist, or blame movies for causing it.If you have a villain who is an insane, manic clown, then showing what led to that is not going to be pretty. It can't be.If you want sunshine and rainbows go watch Marvel on the Disney Channel.The character development in Joker was amazing, showing us how a comedian turned into a psycho-killer clown. Todd Phillips killed it, and Joaquin Phoenix gave one of his greatest performances ever.If you are reading this review and you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend you do; just go into it with an open mind, and realize that this is not your average superhero movie. This is a beautifully dark standalone film showing the transformation of Arthur Fleck, comedian, into Arthur Fleck, psychopath."
4294,"This movie made me create an account to review it.
I've watched it twice in the cinema in 12 hours.
Here's the thing, I studied sociopathy for a few months after seeing it up close in a close person. Joaquin Phoenix didn't just deliver what may be the best performance an actor ever gifted the world (perhaps tied with Branston Cranston's Walter White in Breaking Bad).
But he behaves exactly like a sociopath does, with an origin story that perfectly maps that of many sociopaths - which I won't spoil you with.
He should get one Oscar for best actor, and one for accuracy and realism.
This is not just a movie, it a scientific achievement and it will be used by psychologists and psychiatrists for Aeons to come.
This movie is currently rated 9.2 despite Marvel fans voting it 1 star just to make Endgame higher.
Do the math and you'll see, that means that Joker is right now the highest rated movie in history. Anyone who criticizes Joaquin's perfomance is simply a fortunate person, who never actually met a sociopath and can't understand what they're seeing.
This movie will still be remembered a century from now."
4295,"The first half leaves you wondering how this meek, empty shell of a man could ever become the sinister Joker. Then he flips the switch...slowly. I knew as soon as he started dancing down those stairs. I said to myself he really pulled it off. The weird quirks he develops before you are so unnerving, and gritty it makes you feel uncomfortable watching it. It was almost too realistic. But he did something special here. Epic movie"
4296,Jaquin pheonix should win an Oscar for hos portrayl as Arthur Fleck cause he is outsanding and in a kinda horrifying way.This movie is either a movie you think is boring our you be affected by the tragic and complex story and i was the second option.I haven't really melt it yet cause it affect me a lot but I guess that's what make it such a good movie.
4297,I was rather shocked when watching joker when I say shocked I mean it was excellent. I felt like it wasn't a stereotypical DC film which I loves as they did it different. For me this is one of the best movies that DC has made. The character portrayed in the film is outstanding it is very psychological with the emotions of the characters and we end up feeling attached to the character. I felt very sorry for him and then we end up routing for him. It was well executed and I would give it a perfect 10 . But all in all i can't complain as I loved it.
4298,"Firstly Joker is the best cult movie I've seen in recent years. Joaquin Phoenix really lived the role. especially in the second half of the film we see the real joker. In the first half we see arthur. in fact, in the first half, arthur is a personality that shows the kindness, sacrifice and innocence that most of us want in real life. But joker in the second half is a person who shows that innocence and sacrifice do not actually mean anything to people. people's approach to us affects us. arthur has also transform Joker in a corrupt system. Did he deserve it? no. but the people of gotham deserved it.I can't forget the movies. a really great movie. 10/10."
4299,This movie is the best of the year! You really need to see beacause every thing is perfect!
4300,"Absolutely phenomenal. Pay no mind to journos and pseudo-intellectual critics who name the movie mediocre.
They're doing it because it actually talks about the problem with social alienation and mental health in our society, yet they're shills for big business interest groups that want the public hooked on consumer culture and nothing more.
And they wonder why mass shootings happen. Wouldn't be surprised to see Joker being disqualified for any awards."
4301,"Masterpiece movie, one of the best movies ever
Joaquin phoenix is brilliant actor"
4302,"The first trailer of joker has piqued my interest in the movie. Easily one of the best trailer ever.The movie absolutely satisfied all expectations i had with it. The acting, direction and the writing were exceedingly good. The background score played an intricate part in the story telling.This is surely going to win a couple of Oscars. If you're undecided about watching it;go ahead if you don't mind story telling that focuses on the darkness. If you're expecting the usual cgi ridden fight sequences with cheesy humor and dialouges, then this movie is not for you."
4303,"Redefining the core of how a movie should be made , Extremely Horrifying yet Realistic that Redefined Heath Ledger's ""When The Chips are Down , These Civilised people Will Eat each other"" . A new take a new story but the core creation of JOKER is same , You'd want to Leave the theatre wanting to be like a ""Fleck"" rather than being a ""Wayne"" . The only movie that'll make you fall in love with a ""Criminal"" and ""Street Justice"" ."
4304,"This absolute MASTERPIECE is the best comic movie of all the time , one of the best movies ever , JOAQUIN to be one of the top 10 actors ever , if you didn't see the MASTERPIECE yet stop reading right NOW go and live the dream ,
One more thing HEATH LEDGER salutes JOAQUIN."
4305,"I've never written a review before. This movie deserves praise. It's not an action packed movie like fast & furious. It's not some villain who's causing a good guy hassle but is good at that. This is a complex movie with layers that get unveiled very slowly.I usually don't like slow burners but with Joaquin Pheonix in this movie, I was gripped. His acting can give you goosebumps. The cinematography is absolutely on point with the theme. The sound is really done well and creates some real hair raising moments.What I like most of this movie is the uncertainty. There comes a point when you feel like you know where the movie is heading and you're just proved wrong. You don't know what the he's going to do next.To further talk about the paragraph above I genuinely thought that he was going to kill himself on the show towards the end of the movie. I had doubts on whether this would happen until he teases one of the guys before he lets him go. At this point I was disappointed because I believed he would kill himself.I like the fact that they show you some some things that you see are not real and it brings about a question of whether anything else could not be real.Overall , this movie is really good. Joaquin Pheonix's perfomance is brilliant and at times unreal. This is one of the movies that will have to be rewatched.I give this a solid 10/10."
4306,The darkness of joker was brought to light!! Absolutely brilliantly written and perfectly executed
4307,"I experienced this movie last night. And I say ""experienced"" because this movie completely engulfs you. It sucks you in if you allow it. Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal is absolutely amazing. I have never seen a performance like this from another actor. Closes would be Adrien Brody in the Pianist. The movie twist and turns into a beautiful piece of artwork. I truly hope that we see Joaquin Phoenix as the joker again and I hope we dont have to wait two years to do so.I plan on seeing this movie again, soon."
4308,"Amazing! It stays true to cannon while not feeling like a comic book movie. Its dark and tragic. amazingly well acted. great visuals, its just a sad, dark movie that's an origin story of the joker.I'd love to see a 2nd movie with Joaquin Phoenix as the joker."
4309,"I don't usually make comment but this is a must see movie. Everything is so up to the point , the acting, the music, the songs and the background. It relates so much of the world that we are living in. It's really sad that some people are very arrogant to believe that everyone is living in a wonderful world, only because they are too precious to go on streets to find out the truth"
4310,"I saw Joker last night and man it was intense, interesting, very well done, and nice to see a different perspective of Gothem City through the eyes of how Arthur became Joker.
I watched a couple of reviews on youtube before going in to the theater and the one thing I took from the reviews was how this film represents how someone can eqaily snap in an instant and become emotionally and mentally unstable to turn to their life into commiting crime because no one would listen and that you feel like no one cares. And the only way to get back at the world is to commit crime so that people would notice and pay attention.
I would definitely by this on Blu ray. It was nice to have more of Joker and to also see how we get introduced to the Wayne family in a dark way. I was really happy that they made this rated how so we can see how Arthur lost control and how we got to see him from chapter 1 all the way to the end.
I would Higley recommend you guys go see it or at least wait till it comes out on digital and dvd and Blu ray and watch it for yourself. I never once looked at my watch or anything and kept my eyes on the screen to understand how a mentally ill person can just loose it."
4311,"Joker is the first comic book character made real and he's much more terrifying in this film than any previous incarnation of the super villain. Even if this movie were not about a DC character, it would stand alone as a brilliant portrayal of madness both of a man and the world he inhabits."
4312,"Joker is an absolute masterpiece that I believe will never be forgotten. Joaquin Phoenix did an astoundingly amazing performance. Even though there is no main conflict or plot in the movie, the character study and the character development is truly horrifying and disturbing. The cinematography is also something that will be worth the watch, the colour palette definitely sets the tone for the mood of the film. Overall, this masterpiece is disturbing, horrifying and definitely worth the watch. Every single scene in this movie is perfect and I'm not even exagerating."
4313,"What an amazing movie. I love how this movie is different from any other comic book movie. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is incredible, he definitely deserves an Oscar for this role. The cinemarography in this movie is also perfect. I love Todd Phillips' directing, this definitely his best movie to date. Personally, 'Joker' is one of the best movie of the year (if it's not the best) and probably a top 3 comic book movie of all time, i really hope this movie win an oscar."
4314,"I can see why this wouldn't be for everyone, but I absolutely loves it."
4315,"There is a reason why this masterpiece is being panned by the crony capitalist critics. It challenges their all too comfortable fake construction of reality and it does so in such an effective way, that it almost automatically elicits a dishonest, knee-jerk defensive reaction from them, frightened to the bone that their gaslighting charade might get uncovered. It is not Joker that is delusional, it is they that sell delusions in order to maintain the status quo.But, eventually, and they know it, you get what you deserve. That sentence and that sentiment is what so scares them, because this movie cuts too close to the bone, and like all great, game-changing art, it is just a bit too true.When Joker, who is a true hero here, helps a character, equally mistreated by the powers that be, go free, he points that he was the only one that treated him well. This is a call for kindness that is essence of the movie, but it is barely noticed by those who, like the villain of the movie, Thomas Wayne, think we are all despicable clowns. So they lie and pool wool over our eyes, as they only can, misconstrue and make false scares, so that the point of the movie that is most damaging for them would not get across.All these are marks of a great movie. In Europe, it was instantly recognized - and rewarded, for the subversive potential it has. In North America, it scared the hell out of conformists, and the reaction was, for many, an almost reflexive rejection. Which means it hit, it hit hard, quite uncomfortably so. And if anything the hypo crites hate so much, it is the movie that exposes them, and, even more so, exposes the paper tiger of the blood sucking system they depend on for what it is."
4316,"Can't even believe the basic and stupid bad critics to this masterpiece. You know nothing about acting, directing and post production work if you don't like this movie. From the beginning to the end it's a delicious journey into this perturbed mind and how every act is introduced is incredible surprising. I think the people don't like it is because they were looking for big explosions, stupid CGI and poor acting as they are used to in MCU movies. Oscar will say the truth ;)"
4317,"Very well directed... No comparison with Ledger, but Joaquin Phoenix has done it brilliant!! The story becomes more intense and dark towards the end leaving you awestruck for sometime!!
A good psycho movie rather than a CGI movie!! Already started imagining Heath Ledger in this movie!!"
4318,"Absolutely was shook by this movie & enraptured by the world conveyed onscreen. Beyon the performance, this movie is important. I believe that whole heartedly. This movie was Beautifully sad, relevant, and an overall disturbing & cerebral movie. This movie is about the causes of alienation, not the symptoms. Can honestly say I don't think I've ever been so fully convinced by a performace like jaoquins. I just hope ppl can look past Heath ledgers & judge this on its own."
4319,"Too many movies out there of unhinged characters that are way more problematic to blame this one for the state of violence in America. In fact, it matches the tone def blame Gotham has in the movie for the first act, anger at a vigilante clown, and not the state of society and lack of social services that got them there. Excellent cast, wonderful performance, and shame on all the people who vilified it for personal gain. While it might not be for everyone, especially those not interested in delving into the origins of a mad killer character, there are even more gruesome origin stories out there, this one doesn't deserve all this solo negative attention."
4320,"This is the greatest depiction of a comic book charachter in a movie of all time. Phoenix inhabits this man outcast by society and destined to be the greatest villain Gotham has ever known, and puts his all into it. His performance of a man who's been persecuted his whole life for his mental conditions was immaculate. He brings this charachter to life like no one ever has (Ledger included). Another aspect that can't be swept under the rug is how Impressive of a directing job Phillips did. The fact that he is able to move from directing some of the most renound comedies of all time, to crafting this intense character piece is a credit to his unbelievable skill. The Joker has always been depicted as existing in a world outside of ours, but in this dark drama it's accuratley shown what it would be like if this villain actually existed in the real world. An aspect of this film that's likely not going to get as much attention as it should from general audiences is the score. It's brilliant, and elevates this movie to a whole other level. Don't even hesitate if thinking about watching this movie, do yourself a favor and immerse yourself in this expertly conceived world."
4321,"No spoilers. Like all origin stories it spends way too much time in character development. It also telegraphed it punches. Its is worth seeing just to watch Joaquin Phoenix's performance. It just that the movie did not seem to get the Joker character himself. Their simply was no sense of menace from the Joker, even toward the end of the movie. violence yes, but no menace. Yes I know some people will say the Joker is suppose to use his brain, not his brawn, but if so they did not even show that. Joaquin Phoenix's performance was amazing, but it simply did not convey ""The Joker"" like Heath Ledger, or even Jack Nicholson. IMHO even Jared Leto did a better job. The movie was as indicated above is very American Psycho, in tone, and delivery, including the message, if it was trying to portray a message, which I doubt, because that would have indicated a plot outside of decent into madness. FYI a group of teens left the movie about half way through, it obviously was not what they expected."
4322,"Move over Heath ledger there's a new kid in town!!
Macabre and low-fi gold. With out a doubt the best origin story ever told.
Absolute brilliant performance by Joaquin Phoenix.
Sad redemption that will blow your mind!!!"
4323,Just got done seeing it and wow. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
4324,"This movie is stunning. The music, the cinematography, the acting! Mr. Phoenix outdoes himself in this film. He brings humanity to this character. In the beginning, I feel very sorry for him. I wish I could reach into the screen and let him know its okay. But the further he dives into madness, the more powerful he feels. The happier he seems. JOKER is a movie I cannot express into words. JOKER is a movie you must see for yourself."
4325,"A watch the movie one hour ago. This is Joaquin Phoenix masterpiece. His role as main actor is exceptional. Not sure where the movie ends and where Joaquin acting starts. Amazing movie, hope he wins the Oscar. He truly deserves it."
4326,"The most perfect movie since Braveheart. Everything about the movie was captivating, riveting, and stunning. I don't know Phoenix but I'm proud of him and I feel like every actor out there better watch out. He's going home with every single award."
4327,"I have NEVER seen a movie that made me feel the way this one did. No joke. It's viseral, it's raw, it's deep, it's incredibly heart wrenching and the acting was exquisite. I felt a heaviness in my chest like I've never felt before; and I could legitimately feel the pain and downward spiral into insanity with the character.*Note- this movie is not for everyone. It is NOT a traditional villain/vigilante movie. It's a 2 and a half hour long character study on one of the most infamous DC villains. Don't go into it thinking you've read it from a comic, because you haven't. One of the best versions of a Joker origin ever. Period."
4328,This film is a masterpiece. I struggle to even categorize this work as it feels like you are watching actual people rather than characters.
4329,"Now we're all figure out, that is Heath Ledger was continuing what Joaquin Phoenix will start in the future!PUT A HAPPY FACE :)"
4330,"THANK YOU JOAQUIN, I WILL NEVER FORGET THIS MASTERPIECE!!!"
4331,Coming in as a huge DC fan. This movie hit every right corner!! Joaquin delivered on so many levels and I hope he stays the joker for a long time!! Joaquin did stuff better than Heath ledger. Overall perfect joker movie 100/10
4332,"It is agreat movie , I hope Joaquin Phoenix will win the best actor oscar he deserves it for his amazing performance"
4333,"Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is absolutely great as a man society ignores and when people pay attention to him, they beat the living hell out of him! Arthur is a frustrated wanna be clown-comedian who has a neurological disorder that makes him laugh like crazy. I think the laughs cover the tears he cries. He is on 7 different meds and has to care for his bipolar mother, Penny (Frances Conway). I quote a little from ""Cellophane Man"" song from ""Chicago""- people walk by Arthur and look right through him like he isn't there. In a way, I thought of John C. Reilly putting on white pancake in ""Chicago"" when Arthur was putting his pancake on. Amos Hart and Arthu Fleck are ignored and mistreated by people and you can see their pain.
All of Arthur's frustrations come to a head when he and a woman are bullied by 3 drunk morons who work for Thomas Wayne, a wealthy man Penny worked for 30 years ago. These fools beat up Arthur on the subway and make fun of the clown costume he wears after he entertains sick kids at the hospital. Arthur shoots them with a gun he accidentally dropped at the hospital. Thomas Wayne is disturbed by the killings and wants to be mayor and clean up Gotham. Penny writes to him constantly about her and Arthur's living situation and writing about Arthur being Thomas's son. If so, the Joker and future Batman aka young Bruce Wayne are brothers.
Unfortunately for Arthur, Thomas tells him he is not his father and Penny was mentally ill and adopted Arthur as a little boy. Her boyfriend abused little Arthur. Arthur smothers his hospitalized mother with a pillow and that is when Arthur dies and he becomes the Joker.
In the middle of all this carnage, Arthur is invited to be on his idol Murray Franklin's (Robert Deniro) talk show only to be humiliated by the man. Murray shows his audience Arthur bombing out at a comedy show on a recording. Murray thinks the young man with the clown makeup will entertain everyone, but Arthur reveals what he did on the subway. He shoots Murray and takes off. There is anarchy on the streets of Gotham and the protesters in clown masks see the Joker as their leader.
This exciting, rather gory movie is really about the Joker with the creation of Batman as an afterthought. Joaquin really stretched his acting ability to the limit and his performance overwhelmed me to the point I wanted to smoke a cigarette to calm down! I called down without smoking but it takes a great actor to overwhelm people with a oerformance!"
4334,"Raw, brutal, real, amazing, love this movie with every fiber of my being."
4335,Just go watch it... Theres really no need to review anything. Its up to viewers on what they formulate about the flim...
4336,"In an uncharacteristic masterstroke, Todd Philips (director of Road Trip, The Hangover Trilogy and War Dogs) presents a unique take on the Joker by infusing the real-world tragedies of familial breakdown, abuse, neglect and mental illness into his story arc with sociopolitical unrest and social incivility as a backdrop. In doing so, Joaquin Phoenix's immersive performance gives heart and horror to the underlying nihilistic impulse to ""watch the world burn"" that was missing in the more intellectual ""concept personified"" interpretation by Christopher Nolan and Heath Ledger.While its a sad, violent plunge into psychotic madness may hit home too hard for some viewers, Todd Philips' Joker is a refreshing for its fresh approach that abandons its franchise trappings or Hollywood studio conventions to do something bold and socially relevant despite the gross misinterpretation of critics who think their socially-aware politicos."
4337,Movies like joker haven't existed since taxi driver. A breath of fresh air during an era where we are suffocated with explosions and cgi.
4338,"Seldom do you come across a movie that's so immersive. Joker is about oppression and ridicule of a man by an entire system and unapologetically attempts to be a reflection of the world around us. Joaquin's portrayel as a man with a deeply disturbing childhood days and constantly fighting turbulent weather leads to a build up that almost leads you to diagnose the disturbed mind with a magnifying glass. Unending backstabs and an unstable mind's weight lead a marginalised Arthur, aka joker to creep into the centre stage and become a dark symbol of a chaotic revolution. The sequencing of scenes are buttery, natural and episodes, where his condition makes him laugh in despair and agony magically do the job of passing the pain on to you, and to the person next to you as well. What struck me the most is the sincerity with which a comic character was portrayed without the Shakespearean sentences that often come with a character of this stature. Also, subtle moments like Bruce Wayne and the joker crossing paths are imaginations worth a million colours. Super heroes aside, here is a movie that meticulously digs deep to study the rise of a homegrown devil. As the curtain draws on the joker, he almost makes you want to handshake him and wanting to separate the character from his crimes. It's a movie not for everyone, cause some understandably, wouldn't get the joke."
4339,"Please give him an Oscar he is a true artist I laughed, cried with him"
4340,Joaquin proves once more that he is can outstand any expectation. His acting is epic and the character is monumental. Such a privelege to see him on the screen.
4341,"First: stop wondering if Phoenix' interpretation is better than Ledger's. Both show different profiles from the same character: whereas Ledger showed masterfully a psychotic villain, Phoenix shows (also masterfully) a person, a victim who smoothly is turning into a villain. This is the typical case of horses for courses.Second: Yes, this movie is far better than suicide squad... and I frankly find it better than the DC franchise (except from Nolan´s trilogy). I would say that this is an excellent counterpart of BATMAN BEGINS... the ""Joker Begins"" here. And a very good one!!Third: Definitively the film must pay off for Phoenix and at least give him an Oscar nomination. His interpretation is human, crude and ruthless to the bones. Phoenix succeeds at making us feel compassion, fear and hate for his character all at the same time.I rate it with an 8 because it is very good but not perfect. I felt that Todd Phillips could have given us more ""hangover"" moments across the film to enhance this contrast between comedy and tragedy that the Joker is all about. You will see that there a couple of moments like that, but you will also see that may be Todd could have given more.Go, watch it and enjoy it!!"
4342,I think this movie is the answer to why every nerd enjoyed and read comics to everyone who ever did not understand. Darkness personified...!
4343,I hope this is appreciated in its time not 20 years later as a cult classic
4344,"Joker is bold, unapologetic, raw, bleak, violent, riveting, psychotic. It's everything it promises to be and much more. This is Joaquin's movie, man delivers a performance that will make the best ones squirm, the command on his body and the screen? 10/10It makes you feel for the character and kinda think his actions are justified, but then you question your own morals. The best ones do..This movie is definitely not for everyone, especially if you want a feel good high-five flick go watch one that begins with a red rectangle box.Joker will be discussed for ages to come, cannot believe they pulled it off in a comic book movie of all genres, that too with the Hangover guy making it!Must watch with a crowd."
4345,"Joacquin Phoenix just made his BEST FRIEND, Heath Ledger smile from Heaven in the name of JOKER!Every move he made, every laugh, every dialogue. Just PERFECT. The story-building is very detail, I feel like I can relate to Arthur's feelings. When I saw the movie, I had this mixed-feelings where I can't even express what I feel.This just pure ART. A masterpiece.I can't even!!"
4346,"I'm so emotional when i saw this movie!!!
Almost related with real life and about the actor, i love his expression !scene by scene that's so detail how he smile, how he talk...Really, this's so amazing !!!"
4347,"This movie shows the life before joker, which shows us how the character develops and becoming the joker. It also connects batman's appearance in the next years. Really good film"
4348,"This is the one that deserves to beat The Shawshank Redemption and with all due respect, I would give Joaquin's performance the best Joker title, he is really deep and dark and thats exactly what we want to see from an actor in this type of a character, simply an OSCAR Worthy Performance. Plus, this picture is so clean and it feels like you're watching a movie from hollywood's golden age, really thank you Todd Phillips."
4349,"This movie should be watched without prejudice and other cultural biases as ""critics"" often do.I viewed in on pre-premier and was really happy that it meeted all my expectations. It has a slow flow while packing heavy load of context for each scene. The more I seen the less my DC comic knowledge was involved in story and more real-life it seemed. The last bits that crumbled Jokers hopes in society was shattering for me to. I expected for him to embrace evil from first scenes knowing how cruel Joker is in comics, but Phoenix painfully suffered for more than I could think and he was fighting until last minutes. For me this is the film of the year, it is too deep for it's own good."
4350,"Just unbelievable Masterpiece Movie, Acting was Amazing, will get definitely Oscar."
4351,"Brilliant acting, great story and damn on point.....
'Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?'"
4352,"The best movie of the year
Every one needs to watch it"
4353,"I went in with low expectations since the main appeal of the Joker is that he doesn't have a definite background story. As for Joaquín's acting skills, I wasn't that skeptical since he's definitely known for some amazing performances. But I truly wasn't expecting it to be on par with Heath Ledger's performance! You thought The Dark Knight was dark? Go see Joker and you will definitely be stunned. The cinematography was gorgeous, the soundtracks even more amazing... A few scenes will stay with me (or haunt me) forever. Joker is so good that it can be viewed as a must-see ""preview"" of the Dark Knight. I'm not sure the Oscar's will do this movie justice. Winning the Golden Lion Award said enough about this masterpiece."
4354,"Its insanely insanely great movie! very depressing and dark , and just insanely greattttttt! gonna watch it again soon for d second time!"
4355,"Joaquin Phoenix has done a brilliant job in the movie and you get carried away with this character, his philosophy so much so that you think he is right everytime. That's when you have impressed as an actor. Was truly lucky to catch this one in the theatres."
4356,"Joaquin Phoenix's performance gives chills, no words can describe his talent.Direction is another pleasure! didn't expect this from Todd PhilipsMusic!!! oh god!Can't say and think of anything, you MUST SEE THIS!"
4357,"This movie has everything that your heart desires. Great background score, great camera angle and an amazing storyline. I can't find words to describe the performance by Joaquin Phoenix so I won't even try but that man has set the standards SO high that even he won't be able to cross them. All in all, it's the best I've ever seen and it's a shame that critics are doing what they do and bring down talented people with their horrible writing."
4358,"Very emotional drama! When Arthur laugh because he's been hurt, it's tears me down. But sadly, the audience of my local theater is so stupid, they laugh.The last few minutes is so epic."
4359,I enjoyed the movie a lot more than I imagined. Joaquin is a genius. He deserves the oscar
4360,"'Joker' is not a comic book movie about the origin of a supervillain. Instead, it is a character study of a broken man who finally decides to embrace his insanity, that just so happens to be produced by a recognisable brand. And oh man, how I wish more mainstream films were like this.Joaquin Phoenix delivers a career-defining powerhouse performance as the lead that also arguably redefines the Joker. Whereas the character has previously been portrayed as a criminal mastermind that poses an unstoppable foil to Batman, or in Jared Leto's case, just a joke, Phoenix achieves something I previously thought unfathomable; he makes the character sympathetic.
This Joker, or more precisely, Arthur Fleck, is just an ordinary individual you could easily encounter in the street, who's constantly laughing from the pain of his mere existence. This guy can't catch a break, as he is continuously pushed around and mentally tormented by the world around him, and I could not help but feel pity and remorse for the guy. Even the most subtle nuances Phoenix imposes, such as his changing tone of voice or the way he walks makes his portrayal feel all the more real. When Fleck finally snaps back at the world, I didn't necessarily barrack for him, as his actions are violent and gruesome. However, I was deeply fascinated by how Fleck finally accepts himself as a sociopathic maniac and seeks his own personal justice through the persona of the Joker.
The rest of the supporting cast does a serviceable job, especially Robert De Niro, who hasn't given a performance this lively in years. But Phoenix is the main attraction, and rightfully so. To make the comparison to Heath Ledger's Joker and argue who's better would be pointless. This is a very different portrayal, and I believe the best of both worlds should be embraced.Apart from my ravings about Phoenix, I was very impressed with Todd Phillips' direction, especially considering his previous filmography comprises of sex comedies. Without going too far into spoiler territory, I found the way Phillips chose to tell this story pleasantly surprising. It takes a similar route to something like 'Fight Club' or 'American Psycho', wherein you're unsure whether all the events unfolding on-screen are actually happening in reality or merely the character's imagination. I believe it could be an entirely plausible origin for the Joker in the comics.
Under Phillips' guidance, the majority of the stylistic features are efficiently executed. The muted colour palette and handheld cinematography compliment the film's gritty, realistic tone very well. Hildur Guðnadóttir's score, which is mainly comprised of cellos and other stringed instruments, is hauntingly beautiful. It subtly underscores the Joker's deeper delving into crime and insanity until it crescendos into an anxiety-inducing orchestra when full-on chaos unfolds.My only issue with the film is despite its aims to be a standalone character study, it still dares to shoehorn in tributes and references to the comics. This is only done to a minor extent but it just felt jarring because it did not contribute to the story being told whatsoever.Although I had optimistic hopes for this film, I was still blown away by it. Overall, it was just nice to see a comic book movie that isn't part of a greater cinematic universe that has to set up multiple sequels. Despite all the controversy and criticism swirling around the film's release, I have no doubt over time it will be considered one of the great films of this decade. It is not the perfect comic book movie, but it is rather, the most personal comic book movie I've ever seen."
4361,Juaqine Phoenix's acting was legendary and the story telling was amazing everything in this movie was great that's why I give it 10-10
4362,"Before I start this review, I just want to say that I am not very well versed in comic book law or canon, so I will not be reviewing the accuracy of the Jokers origin story in relation to the comics. Now on with the review...This film is sensational! Everything about this film is brilliant, I can hardly find any fault in it! Joaquin Phoenix is magnificent and is deserving of an Oscar nomination in the very least, and from what I've seen of films this year he should probably win the Oscar at this moment, he is mesmeric every time he is on screen, which is the majority of this film, you cant take your eyes off him. Obviously his performance is going to get compared to Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker and that for me is not unwarranted, I'm not saying it's as good as one of the best performances ever in cinema, but the fact you are able to draw a comparison between the two tells how good Joaquin Phoenix is. The way the character is portrayed and written is very powerful, it's written in such a way that in the beginning you feel sympathy for this character and you almost side with him, meaning when it comes to the end of the film you almost feel personally responsible for the monster he's become.This movie is very dark and goes to some extremely dark places and really makes you think about our world and our society and for a comic book movie to do that is something special and very refreshing. On to the only fault I could find with this movie and its not even a fault about the film, and that is I cannot believe this film is a 15, for me watching this film the use of violence is very powerful very gory and frequent enough in my eyes to warrant an 18 rating, and that's not to say if your 15 you're not mature enough to watch it, I'm purely comparing it to other 18 rated films and in my eyes it should be an 18.The score, soundtrack, and cinematography on display in this film is masterful, some of the shots you see are works of art and there's a sequence towards the end of the film that tracks the titular character through Gotham which is particularly beautiful. The score is fantastic, and it does something similar to Into the Spider-verse, whereby it uses the same score throughout, but the score slowly swells and swells to a crescendo at the end of the film which really puts you back into your seat. The soundtrack accompanies the score and the film beautifully and changes with the character's descent into madness.All in all, believe the hype for this film, you will not be disappointed it truly is a masterpiece and an exceptional piece of film making, which will surely stand the test of time, go and watch this film as soon as you can!10/10"
4363,"Joaquin Phoenix offers his own version of DC Comics' laughing psychopath in the upcoming Warner Bros. Joker movie. It's out Oct. 4, but it's already gotten rave reviews from critics and film festival audiences. In September, Joker took home the Golden Lion top prize at the Venice Film Festival. That's no surprise since a week earlier, it got an eight-minute standing ovation from festival audience members who watched an early screening.""As the mentally ill and socially ignored Arthur, Phoenix burns a hole in the screen,"" our CNET reviewer Rich Trenholm writes. ""From the opening moment when he cracks his mouth into an unnerving fake smile, the three-time Oscar nominee commands your attention."""
4364,"A chef d'oeuvre of the genre, Todd Phillips kills it by directing the most compelling and gripping Joker in recent years.
A showpiece showcasing Joaquin Phoenix as a master of his craft delivering more than an award worthy performance and giving the audience a version of The Joker we didn't know we wanted until now. From the unique cinematography and the tone , down to the haunting score this movie packs an unconventional origin story you shouldn't miss."
4365,"I was fortunate enough to watch this movie on 2 October on an IMAX. And boy.... the movie surely lived up to its hype and humongous expectations. If Heath Ledger was menacing and mesmerizing as Joker in The Dark Knight, Joaquin Pheonix is that unstoppable force that gives us the Joker that we all truly deserved. You will feel his pain , his sorrows , his dreams , his anger... you will become .. the Joker. The movie got a standing ovation at the end. In fact, I got so much into the character, that I could correctly guess what the Joker's reaction would be , in couple of crucial scenes. This is what Tod Phillips and Joaquin Pheonix have achieved. Finally, this movie does not glorify violence and anarchy, it just shows what happens when you push certain people beyond certain boundaries."
4366,"I did not know what to expect from this film but what I walked away with was an appreciation of the master of his craft that is Joaquin Phoenix. His gradual metamorphosis into a man disconnected and disassociated with society and its norms is quite simply brilliant. No other actor could have performed this role so well. He is mesmerising. The story is riveting and confronting. The city of Gotham, covered in rubbish and rats is a powerful metaphor for the decay of society and its civility. It is represented as cruel, cold, and degenerating into chaos. There is no reprieve, no hero to save the day. We are exposed to our real selves otherwise hidden by the mask worn by Arthur Fleck. The script, cinematography and score are sublime but Phoenix is the star of this film and must win an Oscar for this role. There is no performance in recent times that compares to it."
4367,"It is surely not your typical superhero movie. It is fresh, from perspective and storyline. When i walked out the cinema i saw people saying this movie is not as good as they expected. But for me it is a great movie, sure it's no fun and a bit dark. So i think this movie is not suitable for all people. Joaquin Pheonix sure is the man!"
4368,"This movie is great from the start to the finish.
Phoeinix's Joker is amazing. He managed to successfully portray a psychopath that was treated like garbage from the society in the best way. The story is pretty much incredible. The photography is beautiful. This movie has everything a perfect movie must have. Definitely an Oscar winning performance from Phoenix and surely many other nominations such as best cinematography etc. must be added."
4369,Oscar is coming baby
4370,"The movie is all about an iconic comic book character but the story telling has made it an masterpiece. An one of kind movie which doesn't make you feel like an ordinary comic book movie but as a study of a mind slowly spiralling into madness untill he becomes insanity itself.
At the end you just fall in love with Joaquin phoenix's Joker. Todd Phillips has really started something which will be phenomenonal in the future..... trust me it's just a start🃏🤡🤡🃏"
4371,"Tragic? Yes. That's the first word that came to my mind after leaving the theater watching this movie. This movie gonna show you how tragic his life from beginning to end. How he tried to be good but it eventually became bad, how he tried to maintain his sane mind despite knowing that he doesn't. You gonna feel his struggle, his pain, everything he's going through in the entire movie. And you can understand why he did that despite knowing what he's doing is wrong. For me, this is Joaquin best performances. Is it deserve an Oscar? Absolutely, dude stole the show. well not stole, I mean, he IS the show. 10/10"
4372,"Here's my review of Joker , or Taxidriver 2 if I'm being honest . So "" Joker "" is directed by Todd Philips , who's best known for directing the hangover trilogy , due date and war dogs. I thought he was an oddball choice when it was first announced but I get why . The movie stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck , a guy who is constantly tormented by society , and he was great ! .... As Arthur Fleck , but as the joker ? Well that's for you to decide . For me personally I thought he was good , definitely better than Leto's , but in b/w Ledger and Nicholson. The character of joker has has had many origins over his comic book and media appearances . From ' Gotham's ' Jerome valeska ' to Jack Napier , to the mobster from mask of the Phantasm. But the most popular ones are him falling into a pit of acid and the other one about him being a failed stand up comedian which then leads to the acid fall according to ' The killing Joke' by Alan Moore. This movie takes the failed stand up comedian thing from that , drops the acid thing and then sets up it's story , Which I thought was a really nod cause Joker's mainstream origin is now as familiar as Batman's origin. They also set up Batman's origin indirectly to the Joker's which I thought was personally brilliant . This movie justifies Joker's maniacal forced laugh as a medical condition and at one point brings in the question of whether it's legit or if he's faking it . Unlike other iterations the joker is more sane than other people , like from this scene at a comedy club where he's the only guy laughing at the good jokes and everyone else is laughing at the inappropriate ones , so he writes that fact down. This movie borrows a lot of themes from fight club such as the whole "" only when you lose everything are you free to do anything "" and many more. It's also very similar to Nightcrawler in terms of being an underdog story and in making us root for the underdog even though he's a cold blooded merciless. Which is funny because Nightcrawler was a modern take on Taxidriver and this movie is like 80% Taxidriver with the whole experimenting with your gun without a shirt on , the one liners , the philosophical talks , the gun on your temple gesture and lots more . The movie even has frickin Robert De Niro as a late night show host if you want more proof , which is ironic since De Niro plays a failed comedian who gets insulted by a show host in ' the king of comedy ' directed by scorcesse who also directed Taxidriver . God ! My head hurts. Yeah , so I did some googling and it turns out scorcesse helped out with the script . So it all makes sense now . I also liked how Joaquin Phoenix was able to go back and forth between his actual laugh and his medical condition laugh which is similar yet you can spot the difference from how the latter is soulless. That's some brilliant stuff there. I also liked how Phoenix was able make us hope he doesn't get beat up by people in a public train to hoping he doesn't kill that guy. The only gripes I had with this movie was that the soundtrack wasn't powerful enough when it needed to be and that in the third act in a TV studio set , Phoenix was overdoing it. In the end ' Joker ' isn't the best origin for the character , it's a movie which uses the characters label to gain hype for a Taxidriver spinoff which is amazing ! All that stuff I said about the movie being close to Taxidriver is not a critique. Because this movie is brilliant . So it's a great attempt to dive into the psyche of an anarchist and make you wonder .... Chaos is just order yet undeciphered."
4373,This look good and intrstin
4374,"No plot, no message, no point.A miserable excuse for a movie."
4375,"Boring, trash movie. The last 15 minutes was satisfactory. The movie dragged on and on. Tbh, I'm fed up of all these overhyped movies, adastra, starters 2019 the list goes on...."
4376,Terribly boring waste of time! Have had more enjoyable times watching paint age.
4377,Laughing and dancing is 80% of the movie. Did not care at all about anything that happened in this movie. Amazingly bad.
4378,"I didn't see this movie in theaters, ended up renting it. I figured it'd be the type of movie that was more psychological than anything but ended up being dull. Joaquin Phoenix is a good actor but his acting in this one gets pretty repetitive and annoying after a while instead of impressive. Especially since his character acted the same on medication and off.
It's definitely a somewhat interesting take on Joker's backstory but just doesn't follow through. He gets fired from being a clown, finds out he was adopted so he starts killing people including his own mother while in the hospital from a stroke. Which leads me to another point, the movie is kind of sick. You have people starting protests and riots, not much explanation as to why but they start dressing like clowns just because of Joker killing 3 Wall Street younger men on a train. This movie is not a horror or thriller type of movie, more like just a random and ridiculous one. He also takes out Robert De Niro because he made fun of his stand up comedy.
Most seem to like this movie because of the acting and the dark tone which is fine. Although if you don't enjoy movies that are slow paced, have very little plot and are hyped because it was different than ""the usual popular movies"" then this movie probably isn't for you. Also one other thing.. Joker looks like he's in his 40s and Bruce Wayne is probably like 8-10 so does Batman fight him when he's a senior?"
4379,"I don't understand how this movie got 8,6 rating...
Of course Joaquin Phoenix plays his role extremely well but the movie it's a fraud...
Scenario and plot it's something different from real Joker's storyline...
Extremely overated for me..."
4380,"Boring boring and boring. First time I saw the joker half naked i couldn't think of anything else but the Machinist. Out of line with the whole Batman saga, and the hypocrisy to say you are sorry for a very deranged sick psychopath.
The trend of making good what is bad and the other way around is the real problem of society , not the way we treat abused people."
4381,"Just a pale story of a super depressed guy who gets bullied by almost everyone. Doesn't seem to have that kind of intelligence or smartness to check BATMAN'S intelligence.
No suspension or anything."
4382,"2 hours of movie with about 10 minutes of interest. The Joker is a study in how to take a beloved icon and turn him into a pathetic loser that no one cares about. This Joker isn't a clown prince of crime, he's a failed clown who is terrible at his job, terrible at life and needs to be medicated to prevent delusions of competency. Sure there is a subtext of how society is fails those who need mental help, but that theme is buried under the 'eat the rich' theme where the man trying to help pull the city out of a rut is demonized.
Frankly this movie is little more than an exercise in 'woe is me'-ism and not worth the time needed to watch it."
4383,"This movie is a shame to the joker character. That character that is supposed to be consumed by an idea beyond the grasp of normal people is depicted as a weak pathetic man who is so petty that all he wants is attention from anyone, just anyone, and that would solve his problems.Part of his problems are due to his low self-esteem, which I don't know why he blames people for it. I mean you work as a clown and you demand respect, that's pathetic.The character is just weak and all it needs is a girl who gives him attention and a decent job, that will solve all his problems, which is the problem with his character. If these were the problems of THE joker, then he's just a nobody who doesn't qualify to be the head of the city gangs
This movie dragged the good name of the joker through the mud"
4384,"19 years ago, Joaqin Phoenix was robbed of his Oscar but this time it'll be almost impossible to top this performance this year in movies.Phoenix dazzles as this sort of distressed, twisted character that has everything in life going against him. Gotham truly is a cruel city and you end the movie questioning whose side you're on.The links to to Wayne family in this picture also grow the folklore around the Joker-Batman dynamic and you get a greater sense as to why their stories are so intertwined. Really classy touch.Going into this, I felt this 2hour + movie would drag but each and every scene meshes well together, the 1st act makes you grow attached to Arthur as he battles against these demons in his life and the middle & final acts pay your patience with a bunch of twists & turns that you didn't see coming.Worth every second, tightly written script and I can't wait for what DC has in store for us moving forward with these stand alone features. 10/10"
4385,"Depressing mess. I should have known when the art snobs gave it a standing ovation that it was going to be awful. Just sad and self-absorbed. Phoenix has always been a strange one with his ""rap career"" and past performances. His last movie BEFORE THEY KNOW was just abysmal. This is that with a little more depression."
4386,"This may be the worst movie I've ever seen. Its not the politics that bothered me. It was just very difficult to watch. Too dark, too gross, too close to the horror genre. While Phoenix is a great actor, I don't like what he did with the character."
4387,"Joker in his first appearance, wore a red helmet, cape, and went by RedHood...never happens in this sad excuse for a Joker movie. Originally robbed a chemical plant and jumped into a vat of chemicals to escape Batman, which made him into the Joker we all know...none of this is in the movie.
If this was a stand alone movie having it's own character it would have been amazing...but it steals a well known name to do absolutely no justice to the character."
4388,"Although Joaquin Phoenix did an incredible job, this backstory trip into the pathos of the Joker could have been achieved equally as well with a few lines in another movie. It's incredibly predictable. I am one who doesn't mind a slow brewing movie as long as there's a point to it, which this movie achieved in its first slow closeup. Every one after that was like, ""here, you want some more slow? How about an extra serving of maudlin? Would you like some whine with that?"""
4389,Joaquin Phoenix acting was brilliant but the movie is disturbing. A slow movie
4390,"So they stole King of Comedy and Taxi Driver, put it on a comic book character, made a self indulgent snooze fest, and get oscars for it. Only redeeming qualities are the score and the performances. It does what is sets out to achieve, but not without stealing form Scorsese."
4391,"Meh, it was ok-ish...at best.I was expecting much more from this movie, didn't liked it so much."
4392,"The attempt at being a riveting drama with an anti-hero as a leading character felt not only forced, but also out of place considering the roots of its character. It is like the writer/director just took the famous name and tried to make a tale of tragedy by ignoring the source material, except by just dropping in some fanservice in a sad attempt at trying to tie the movie to the DC universe. Our favorite psychotic sociopath became a generic mentally ill outcast, whose life is so, so against him that wherever he turned he was vilified. His family life is in shatters, his job is soul-crushing, his ""friends"" backstab him, his psychologist does not care about him, the system is failing him, women think he is a creep and yet somehow he accidentally becomes responsible for a revolution that leads to the murder of the Wayne family. Like, really? I know the director is trying to make him relatable and the movie as ""realistic"" as possible but with that premise it sure asks for a humongous amount of suspension of disbelief. Not to mention the movie is so self-serious The Dark Knight would be jealous. I think this movie is the most pompous movie ever since The Dark Knight, like oh God, throw in some bleak humor or at least show you're self-conscious about how much egostroking is going on.I know mentally ill people have a hard time in the U.S. - which this movie is supposedly trying to touch upon - but the movie really just scratches the surface without ever really going in depth with it. Also everything feels forced and phoned in, from the directing, writing, acting and exectution. And no, I do not feel the ""punchline"" at the end where Joker is laughing and saying ""you wouldn't get it"" will save the pretentiousness of the movie. It was just a cringeworthy attempt at trying to tie it into the Batverse as lazily as possible. Like, we already get from the title that this is Batman's nemesis and it is taking place in it. No need to shove in a lazy fanservice to phone it in. And no, this is not an intelligent movie nor is it that good of a drama. If I really want to watch a movie about a man losing his real self to an alter-ego I would much rather watch Bronson. At least that one is entertaining and has some moments of unintentional hilarity. But this, this is trying too hard to be realistic and artsy at the same time yet asking for a lot of suspension of disbelief that I just can not get into the hype and get immersed. I would consider this a sub-par drama at best. 4/10"
4393,"I had to give at least one star for Phoenix's performance (it's great even if it...is a little heavy handed?) but the whole of this movie is sadly not worth the ELEVEN!!!! Oscar nominations it got. It may not be fair to compare Phoenix's Joker with Heath Ledger's now-iconic one, so I think it's more important to focus on the movie itself.The Joker is a lazy film that spends most of its runtime trying to make the audience understand why a man would become the classically unhinged and maniacal DC villain (while taking a note from Nolan's book and creating this movie in a world that seems pretty much detached from the rest of the DC cinematic universe.)That sounds great! The premise itself has tons of potential to be compelling and disturbing. Instead, we are given a series of scenes in which Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) is either degraded by his coworkers and strangers or getting kindly rejected by women (there is a reason why people have referred to this as an ""Incel movie""...). We also learn he has had a troubled childhood. At no point in this movie is there a moment I feel genuine empathy for the Joker. I say this because ""humanizing the famous JOKER"" seems to be the the overarching goal of the film, to the very end where our Joker leads chaotic riots through the streets after murdering Robert Di Nero on live television.Ultimately, I think one of the least-necessary movies in 2019 is one focused on empathizing with a troubled white adult man who was mistreated by society and rejected by women until he snapped and killed everyone...If you think this is a too simplistic reception of this movie and Todd Phillips's Joker depiction, ask yourself.l: what value does this movie bring? What conversation is it trying to have? What themes is it contending with? When we boil things down, Arthur Fleck is a straight white dude who had a very crappy, psychologically traumatic life. And then he killed a person. Then several more. He may have even killed that very nice neighbor of his (Zazie Beetz! Deserved better!) and her son, though it is never explicitly shown.What, then, is the message of this movie? I am skeptical of any depiction of a character like Arthur Fleck that is more interested in displaying a few instances of him being mistreated by people rather than interrogating him and the society that made him."
4394,The movie is all about finding yourself within and connecting to the present world. Sounds familiar but in a very dark way.
4395,"Don't watch this is you are expecting classic joker, and the odd cameo of a Gotham villain or dark knight.
This is a story about a mans mental health breakdown. The acting is brilliant, it's funny when it's probably not meant to be, and it's very very disturbing.
A solid dramatic film, and nothing to do with superheros."
4396,Full movie is full of twist & suspenseful.ehehuuv hejsifud hdjeuhbeheheh.djieidh
4397,"This is a stand-alone movie that only has a superficial connection to the Batman franchise. An almost complete reimagination of the Joker character. Once one accepts that, it is very enjoyable. Phoenix absolutely owns the screen from start to finish. It is pointless to compare his performance to Ledger's or Nicholson's, just like it would be pointless to compare Bale to Keaton or to Adam West. It did bother me a bit that this Joker wasn't highly intelligent like previous ones, but that's fine. And so is the very negative portrayal of Thomas Wayne. This movie is all about trying to understand what drives some people crazy, and I can't think of any movie that does a better job at that. In addition, the cinematography is excellent and so is the score. This is not for everyone. My guess is that people who have been lucky enough to have lived sheltered lives will not get this. Also, people who are obsessed with Batman will probably hate it. And of course if you are averse to graphic violence, this is not going to be your cup of tea, but such is life."
4398,The movie keeps one's attention at almost every scene. Such great acting. I even tried some of Joker's moves in front of a mirror. Love this movie! So real!
4399,"What a great direction to take the Joker character to.
Dark, brooding, visually spectacular and that's just Joaquin Phoenix!!Something that stands apart from this genre that should (and has been) celebrated.Top Film."
4400,"Low expectations and subverted expectations play a big part in this film's success, although not the biggest part. The levels of expectation on a DC 'universe' film is now pretty low - to the point that someone with film OCD like myself has not bothered to even dip a toe in recent years; likewise what one expects from a superhero genre origin story is not something like this. The sense of pleasant surprise certainly helped the success of the film, but it is not the main thing.The main reason is the central performance of Phoenix. He is totally committed to selling his character throughout, and even in the weakest moments of narrative, you believe his character in terms of its roots, development, and actions. It is not a film that would normally be associated with awards, but it would be a significant failure were he not to be recognized for how much he delivered and how much he made the film. A secondary reason the film works is its cinematic heritage in the films of Scorsese in so much as it falls between Taxi Driver and King of Comedy. This is not accidental, and the casting deserve a lot of credit of getting actors of the quality of Phoenix and de Niro (although the latter does more as a reference than an actor). With these elements working well, the film produces an engaging origin story that feels responsible but yet fitting the character. I could have done with it stopping just a few seconds earlier than it did, because I'm not sure that the ""maybe it was all imagined"" bit at the end was a good idea.Otherwise, it is enjoyably dark and deliberate, and is driven by Phoenix, even if the film is not as brilliant as some would have you believe."
4401,"Hey Gaye's It's BELIEVABLE. There could be multiple JOKERs living in our society that could shake those around them in much bitter way than the film shows making people uncomforting people. Consider this a wake up call, a message, but first a film. A PERFECT film.. I like it"
4402,"After almost a year of hearing, 'you've got to see this film', I realise I'm late to the Joker's party but, I finally sat down to watch this today and was struck from the outset by miraculous storytelling akin to that which I experienced as a child and went on to elicit the compulsion in me to work in a creative field as an adult.It is rare, especially now, in a movie world that seems to have lost it's original creativity, to be lucky enough to witness a piece of art (because that's what this is to this viewer) that embodies so many enviable qualities. From cool, dark, poetic and unexpected; to eloquent and balletic with a beautiful melancholy weaving through a sometimes genuinely funny, frightening and beautifully shot film.I found I could not take my eyes off him. He's compelling, and worrying, but with such a sweetness about him.Q: Can a murderer be sweet?
A: Yes he can.It has a 'once upon a time' fairytale feel that I found I couldn't fault, and now know it will be a film that will demand rewatching.No doubt, with every viewing, you'll see and hear something you didn't see or hear before.It's the film equivalent of a great album that you'd only ever listened to on vinyl and then you hear it, digitally, and with a great pair of headphones, and experience it on a whole other level.It's a beautiful film that made this viewer lean in and one which reminded me of silent movies, and the classics, and graphic novels all rolled into one chilling gem.I love the possibility that The Joker and Bruce Wayne are half-brothers. That's an unexpected and quite intriguing twist right there.If there was ever a 'bad guy' to root for, well: this is that bad guy."
4403,"With sections of New York and New Jersey standing in for Gotham City this movie depicts the origin story of The Joker. Joaquin Phoenix is Arthur Fleck, still living in a small apartment with his mother, working menial jobs he can get with the ambition to be a successful stand up comic. But life often deals us hard knocks for no reason at all and Arthur, with his own mental illness driving him, has increasing difficulty handling them. It all comes to a head when on the subway, dressed in his clown suit after a job, when he gets accosted by three Wall Street types.The thing about the actor Phoenix, he always puts himself out there totally, he always has. He is just perfect here, his demeanor, his body language, his facial expressions, even the awkward way he runs. He deserves his Best Actor Oscar.This is set at the time when Bruce Wayne was a young boy, the time that he witnessed his parents being killed in the alley after a theater performance. There is a brief encounter at the gates of the Wayne home, of the eventual Batman and the eventual Joker.I really didn't think I'd like this movie but it really is a fine one, even though fiction of course it shows how mental illness greatly influences the trajectory of one's life. It was also fun to see Robert De Niro as late night show host Murray Franklin, patterned after the old Johnny Carson show, even with a trumpeter as the band leader.I watched it at home on BluRay from my public library, my wife skipped. The disc has a number of worthwhile ""extras."""
4404,A filme where the villain can transmit sympathy. It's not exaggerated and can shock you only the acting.
4405,"Absolutely phenomenal. Oscar worthy performance from Mr. Phoenix. A movie live up to the name ""The Clown Prince of Crime"
4406,"Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime"
4407,"I can't get over how impressive Joaquin Phoenix is in this movie. It's a chilling, visually outstanding film with a supreme level of tension throughout. Phoenix blows you away with his transformation from innocent, ignored and overlooked loner to confident and violent villain.Amazing!"
4408,"Joaquin Pheonix did an amazing portrayel of the most iconic character Joker.Awesome concept and story..some scene are disturbing only 18+ should watch this.
One of the best dark movie from DC after a long time..must watch"
4409,"Like most people, I'm Joker'd out. Especially after seeing a bonafide cameo trash job from Jared Leto in Suicide Squad. I was dragged to see this by a friend when it came out. So glad I went. Phoenix got what he deserved for this performance: an Oscar. He's that good. Todd Phillips really surprised me directing this. He's a good comedy director(Hangover, Oldschool, etc), but I didn't know he had the ability to make you feel sorrow and pity this way. Sweet score too. There are always gonna be haters. Rolling Stone trashed Led Zepplin back in the day. I've heard detractors call this movie a rip off of other films like The Last King of Comedy. But everything borrows from something else before it at this point. The real key is whether anyone else is doing it that way now. That answer is a resounding No. Phoenix makes Ledger's demonic take on The Joker look like a one-dimensional excerpt from an episode of Glee by comparison. But the best part of this film for me is that it shines a light on what life is really like for so many people in society today. It exposes the bull**** that makes some people uncomfortable acknowledging. That's noble and worth watching."
4410,"Well,giving into the buzz I did go to check out what the hype was about and was actually not ""AMAZED"" to my peers' astonishment. According to me this movie let me down, the sole reason being my inexplicable(a tad too much) expectation of being swept off my feet with the movie content. But this movie definitely deserves acclaim for the wonderful cinematography and obviously for the ONE AND ONLY THE 'JOKER',JOAQUIN PHOENIX.
Mind blowing performance of Phoenix was perhaps the only good thing that will always echo in my mind. The portrayal of the fact that the society was the murderer and not him didn't strike the right chords in my heart. The society is and will always be unjust to someone or the other, but that cannot be the driving force for someone to steer towards the criminal mindset. Hence I couldn't empathize with the psycho-delusional character of the 'JOKER',which was being hailed to by some. The extreme darkness and psycho murderer traits were beautifully enacted but it failed to enthrall me.
The film JOKER is a pure masterpiece in terms of both drama and content, but did not live up to my expectations."
4411,"I have no problem saying that acting of Joaqin Phoenix Phoenix was absolutley brilliant. But it needs mo make a movie and the rest of it its just not there. Action is boring trying to make a hero out of intellectual challenged man, its painful to watch how they try to build a movie on expense of Mr. Phoenix alone."
4412,Fantastic performance by Joaquin Pheonix! He carries the movie throughout the duration and really is believable as this character. I felt the story could have been a little more fleshed out and the duration could have been a little longer making it a true epic. By the ending of the film it feels like it is left at a halfway point and leaves me wanting more! Solid 8/10 from me.
4413,Joaquin Phoenix a masterful performance and showing the most human side of a villain
4414,"One man show, definitely Oscar level acting, but not much story"
4415,"A terrible life may be inspiring, but it's more likely to be a total loss."
4416,"This movie provides so much depth into the backstory of the Joker character and a disturbed mind, and how much of that is just true madness or an actual character. Superbly acted and finally a well deserved Oscar win for Phoenix."
4417,"Let's give Joaquin Phoenix a huge applaud, he delivered one of the hardest roles in history, such a mesmerizing and amazing performance, this is something that we will remember for years! Heath ledger would be proud. Much darker version than I'd expected, the movie definitely reached my expectations, with the realistic, dark and gore joker. They finished the loose ends and made us realize how ""joker"" was made, all of the physicality and emotional depth that triggered Arthur Fleck's inner joker was stunning and pure, the movie also had one of the best character development in movie history, this is such a role to remember!!"
4418,"I expected more from him at how much advertising was done.
a good movie, not great but good"
4419,"I'm glad I missed the hype train for this. Just got around to seeing it, and It was nice to see it without the crazy headlines.
The Oscars got it right. Phoenix was great, similar to Ledger in the Dark Knight he was the best part in a decent movie.
There was some thoughtful messages about mental health, and as someone who's had anger management problems, some of the story elements rang true. It actually started a conversation with my partner after the movie, and I said I was lucky to get the help I needed, thankfully there were no cutbacks to the service!
But for someone who desperately needs help and can't get it, the world is bleak. And that's what this movie tries to portray.This movie won't turn you into a crazed g*n man. It doesn't promote violence. But what it does do is explores our relationship with 'civil' society, and what happens when we stop caring about people, and naturally violence is born of this.Very relevant to what's going on in the real world I'm sorry to say.Good movie. Not sure I need to see it again anytime soon."
4420,"Phoenix is great and deserved the Oscar. But the story is kind of generic, unstable person gets revenge on people who he feels have wronged him. If it wasn't for the title of the film and a few mentions of the Wayne's family, this film wouldn't have made near as much money and know one would be talking about it."
4421,"The movie is good, and the acting is great. However, this story has been retold before. More than once. It just so happens that this time, it is a super villains origin... and those who watch it now, will probably never have watched or seen the original. This is both good and bad... new people who would never watch the original get to enjoy it as well in a new suit (Though not as good), but the old fans get to see Jokers real origin ruined because DC never manages to properly stick to their original stories and have to retell then in slightly different ways 100 times like Batman."
4422,"From Joaquin's incredible performance to the amazing and smart story-telling, this movie is a masterpiece.You know people who judged Joaquin's role and said they preferred seeing Heath Ledger as Joker are wrong.
Don't get me wrong Heath was an iconic Joker character he deserves all fans, but some critics didn't really get this movie's main idea.I say both of them did an amazing job acting as Joker.
Heath Ledger as the famous comic book Joker , enjoyed by kids and teens.
And Joaquin as the psycho mental ill Joker, who was affected by people around him and how they treated him.I think what the script and director wanted to focus on was not only Joker character, but actually what comes out of any mentally unstable person who has been bullied in his life like that.This is an awesome movie with an emotional message for us all.
And it's definitely a must-see!"
4423,I loved this film and the characters with the main character. One of the best film I saw in Oscar for 2020 after so many years since Joker of Batman. i will rate this film at 9 for a great connection shown in the film with the present society using powers and all comes down by one man and all supports we see at the end.
4424,"After Heath Ledger's Joker performance I skeptical of any film starring the ""The Clown Prince of Crime"". but this film was a completely different take on the Joker.Not necessarily an origin story of the villain that we all know, but the breaking and evolution of the man who inspired the crime rebellion of the batman's Gotham. Joaquin Phoenix was brilliant in his portrayal, this psychological crime-thriller was haunting and dark. Capturing what seems to be the last glimmer of light in the city of Gotham though the eyes of mentally ill, comedian hopeful Arthur fleck."
4425,"A socially isolated man killing people mercilessly and you justify the same?
It may be the easiest way to depict the film but Joker is not really a film, it is an experience. A few of the critics depicted the film as dangerous to the society, some even tagged it as leftist, a few of them started comparing Phoenix with Heath Ledger. Well, a self-pitied man dancing in his own rhythm after killing innocents or creating a riot cannot be justified. But wait... all we are talking about is a movie. And a movie is like a canvas and that canvas belonged to the director. Here I see Joker as a perfect painting by Todd Philips.
You may feel disgusted with the very idea of the film but as a film Joker stands out. If I ever been asked to define a 'complete movie', Joker would definitely be in the top ten of them.
I was born in a small town and grew up reading Indrajal Comics. My superheroes were more or less unidimensional like Phantom, Mandrake, Flash Gordon. The first introduction to Marvel was in the early 90s through Spiderman. My introduction to DC and Marvel was made much later in my life and took me a few years to realize the layers of a character like Joker. What I like most about the film is that you need not be an expert in DC Comics to feel the film. Joker has gone way beyond DC and the film is a perfect metamorphosis of a character from the comic book to a larger than life antihero.
Joaquin Phoenix has played a mentally disturbed man even in the past (To Die For). The character he played in Gladiator was also not of a stable man. I was extremely disturbed by Phoenix's depiction of the fictionalized version of Roman Emperor Commodus in Gladiator. But if that was disturbing, what he did as Joker is phenomenally disturbing, utterly unnerving and needless to say a brilliant performance. I think the history of cinema will remember Joaquin for playing Joker. As a performance, this is truly masterclass.
There are few films which remain with you for a while. There are few films that are difficult to forget and there are few films which you want to forget but difficult to get rid of. Joker is such a film. Todd Phillips has made a masterpiece.
Don't miss this experience
If I ever make a film, I will try to make a film as perfect as Joker. And that is the reason for which I could never make a film. I hate myself for recommending strongly to go and watch Joker."
4426,"I have been a film aficionado since as long as I can remember and there is a very select few films I consider to be a masterpiece. On that list is Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and De Palma's Carrie. I have now added Todd Phillip's Joker.
Joaquin Pheonix is incredible and deserves every bit of the Oscar. You forget Pheonix is even in this film because you are so lost in his character. The score is magnificent, that was actually my first thought after watching this film, I thought it would be a crime if Joker didn't win the Oscar for best score.
The way the story ties into the world of Gotham and Batman is extra bonus. You must not forget the setting this movie takes place. Your brain wants to say it's New York City, but it's not. It's Gotham."
4427,"This movie is nothing more than a masterpiece. But the fact that it ONLY has a 8.5 RT score tells us that this is alla BS.
Just bought it on 4K and it's AMAZING.
The movie makes some GREAT comments on our society."
4428,"This movie was superbly well done. The acting was brilliant, and the emotional and physical depth was moving. Brings up important issues such as mental health."
4429,In starting the story builds up very slow but in the end it was a masterpiece :)
4430,"For a film with such incredible hype I was split. One, because while sometimes films with such hype or even build-up can be great they can lead the viewer to think they are much more ordinary than the reviews had told them. Second, I did want to see this film because I did think Joaquin Phoenix was a good actor.My wife saw this in the theatre with a friend of ours and loved it, so she watched it for the second time, after perhaps a month with me this time. Early on in the film I could feel that this was going to be in the least a very good film and enjoyed how it had a completely different feel from other comic book-movies that are being made. Also like a total 360 degree flip to the classic SUPERMAN films of the 80s or original BATMAN series. Sometimes putting a new flavour on something known or loved can be a bad idea. Not here though.Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck who is totally depressed. He has a number of mental illnesses, but one is that his dealing with stress is to laugh with hilarity. It is about him, his mental illnesses and his rise to become Joker. He is the most unstable version of the Joker I have seen.While I thought there were some holes in the film and at times plausibility is sort of thrown out the window even though it is extremely grounded for a comic book-movie. But, that is okay because of Phoenix's performance. I think he is exceptional in the role and he did win an Oscar for it. Through his performance and the script we are looking at the mental illnesses as well as the wonderful performance. Not in the case of say Jack Nicholson (who I think does not get enough credit anymore for his performance, but that is what happens after Heath Ledger and Joaquin Phoenix's performances) who shows a wonderful performance of someone who has mental illnesses, but not really looking at the mental illnesses.The other thing I loved about this film was the casting of Robert DeNiro. For a lover of films and one who loves classic films as much as current films (okay...probably more) the addition of DeNiro when dealing with the subject matter of mental illness and him being late night show host Murray Franklin stirs up in my mind Martin Scorsese's THE KING OF COMEDY and TAXI DRIVER. Which is kind of like playing with a loaded gun in my opinion, but here co-writer/directer Todd Phillips does a great job in the handling of that character and DeNiro's performance.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is and should be mentioned in the same breath as fantastic actors before him like DeNiro, Nicholson, Anthony Perkins and Anthony Hopkins who played characters with severe mental illnesses.I would recommend this to anyone who has an interest in that subject matter before I would recommend it to anyone who loves comics or the BATMAN comics (who really only plays a minor role in this one). This one isn't for kiddies though due to the subject matter, violence and language."
4431,"This film is a repressed, ferocious and tragic film, which is mainly about Arthur, a hero who plays clown for a living. He is a person who lives at the bottom of the society. Arthur in the process of playing clown, there have been a lot of tragic experiences, when he painted his own ugly makeup, sometimes makeup and tears. I was very impressed by the opening of the film. Arthur Flake danced in the public toilet. To restrain your emotions in this way. During the Oscars season, Jackie Phoenix explained why the impromptu dance was created and the source of inspiration for the dance.In the chaotic Gotham clown film, Arthur Flake, the protagonist, pushed his emotions to the most exciting part with the occurrence of one thing, a turning point when Arthur met three men on the subway and was flirting with a girl when his laughter broke out and he began to laugh crazily. After that, the three men began to beat Arthur. Arthur, this is no longer can not help but the heart of the madness. Arthur killed the white-collar workers of Wayne Group with a gun. he fled to a remote public toilet to calm down his emotions, and then Arthur danced.
Arthur suffered from a disease called laughter, that is, he could not help laughing out of control under unconsciously circumstances. Arthur saw a child on the bus. He was very happy to start teasing the children. But when the child's mother saw Arthur, she refused to let the children play with him. Arthur suddenly laughed. Arthur suddenly laughed. At this time, everyone on the bus looked at him. Arthur quickly took out a business card that wrote that he had a wild smile and showed it to the child's mother, but the mother was still a look of disdain.Finally, all these things put together to make his mood burst, he began to crazy, we can imagine that a person at the bottom of society-Dan burst, which would be a destructive force. I think the emotional expression of the whole film is very depressed, from every detail situation can feel a kind of darkness and depression. It's as if we ourselves have some negative emotions piled up in our hearts every day, and we will vent them to a certain extent, just like the clown's expression of this emotion."
4432,"This movie checks all the boxes, not only checks, but aces expectations. Great character development, awesome plot. This is amazing beyond expectation, as i had doubts going into the movie about this being a over-rated garbage people promote, but i was left wanting more."
4433,"I went into this movie expecting a DC film about The Joker. What I wasn't expecting, was a movie that took itself way way too seriously. The psychological disorder that Arthur suffers from is laughable (no pun intended). The people that thought this spoke to the mentally Ill are the same people that thought Black Panther was revolutionary. This movie does not depict what actual Depression is like.Now for the stuff I really enjoyed about this movie. I do not believe this was a good role for Joaquin Phoenix (The voice is just not Joker), but I believe he gave a terrific performance nonetheless. It was obvious from the get go that this was his movie. The acting and the dialogue were 10/10.But the bad outweighs the good. First of all, I could not stand the musical score they went with. There was absolutely no variety to it and it honestly hurt to listen to. We also did not get to see many other performances in this movie and it was a waste of De Niro and Beetz. I also think that glorifying of murder and chaos was far too abundant. This film made all of the heroes the bad guys. Thomas Wayne, Alfred Pennyworth, and the local population were just scumbags in this film.Overall, I was mostly disappointed but Phoenix got me through this flick. Probably will not see again."
4434,"I didn't expect much from this movie, but oh wow! Amazing movie and unbelievable role play! Definitely in my Top 10!"
4435,"Movie contains many actions of social injustice and unfairness. Despite my dislike of most leftist arguments as being weak and lazy, I agree that movie is mostly about people in despair who can't take care of themselves and are threw out like garbage.
Joakin Phoenix and Robert De Niro play are outstanding.
The movie is very uncomfortable as it should be."
4436,"This Joker movie was amazing compared to all other DC Stories of the joker. It's 100% real. There's not falling into chemicals or any of that nonsense. It's all mental disability and shows him as a regular guy becoming the joker. Why, how, and when. Joaquin Phoenix did an excellent job and I would love to see him in future movies as the ""Joker""."
4437,"It is not a superhero film at all, but a crime film with ordinary low-level citizens as the protagonist. It is also probably the most profound analysis of human nature in all DC movies these years. The film has an excellent atmosphere for Gotham City. Dark and wet roads, garbage-filled streets, and a riotous atmosphere... This environment, coupled with a tragic life and a bad day, are enough to drive an honest poor into the abyss. Every step is so believable."
4438,"It's made me laugh, cry, and made me feel scared. Background music design and the way of acting, i love this movie."
4439,"Truly the best take on the Jokers decent into madness at its core, Phoenix took it to another level by losing weight and writing a journal his method was the best and he deserves the oscar for it"
4440,"In Gotham City, mentally troubled comedian Arthur Fleck is disregarded and mistreated by society. People like rich people do politics so the town goes for rich people by rich people. And they don't do protruding things because they don't want other people to think themselves are crazy. But Arthur does what he thinks is right or true. Actually I didn't know if they are crazy or he is crazy. They might be crazy. They just don't think it because they are majority.
At the end of this movie, he was rampaging in the hospital. So the whole of the story in this movie might be his dream..."
4441,"""I just hope my death is worth more than my life."""
4442,"Actors cast are great. Everybody on his place. Especially main character, you feel his pain through a blue screen. Also I want to say thanks for operators and producer works. But what about a story? The story is pretty simple and sometimes very boring, you will wait more then half of the movie to really interesting changing of something in it. And is the movie worth candles? Yes it is."
4443,"Joaquin Phoenix makes a perfect Joker, maybe the best I have ever seen, the soundtrack is so good, good music in the perfect moments, makeup so good.
The only thing missing from this film is a better screenplay, I think it could be so much better, they could explore so many areas rather than a non catharsis film, like American Psycho, but in this case I think it didn't work well with the character"
4444,"He may be just an ordinary mental patient, and none of this has happened, but it is just a joke that a mental patient has come up with in the background of society, it is real enough, sad enough, and funny enough. I hope life can be kind to us."
4445,Phoenix makes a Good Joker. I say Good because the Film in itself could of been better. The Story and Plot could of done more to pull you in with interest. All and all good and entertaining
4446,"It's not a super British movie at all. It's a crime movie with ordinary low-level citizens as the main characters. It's probably the most profound one among all the movies of Marvel DC in recent years. The film creates an excellent atmosphere for Gotham City, with dark and humid roads, garbage filled streets, and a sense of impending violence. Such an environment, coupled with a tragic life experience and a bad day, is enough to force an honest poor man into the abyss, turning a little bit from rational goodness to numbness and madness, and every step of transformation is authentic. Jackun Phoenix's bony appearance is heartbreaking. There is no doubt that the movie's King level performance, ""no clown after Heath Ledger"" can be taken back."
4447,"From the outside to the inside is a human tragedy, on the clown's development, the original is terminally ill gao tan dragged into the abyss, the last carnival seems to have no end, with the current trend of sweeping the world, the reference to the reality is more worth pondering. There is no normal dialogue mechanism. The classes just talk to each other and then curse each other. If it's just the gap between the rich and the poor, that's fine, but it's an ideological split. In Martin's the king of comedy, Robert DE niro had to kidnap talk-show star jerry to get his chance on stage, saying I'd rather be king of the night than dull of the night. More than 30 years ago, Martin saw things through, so in a world where class barriers are so thick, tensions are already simmering. But where does this movement end? At the end, the clown said there was a joke that you didn't understand. Is the world waiting for batman to come to the rescue?"
4448,"The cinematography was impressive, it made you feel like you were immersed in the film. The soundtrack fit well and guided the audience's emotions where they needed to go. The film did a wonderful job of stirring emotion and tention throughout the film. The transitions were well thought out and made the movie flow naturally. The film felt drawn out focusing on the drama, but it was easy to follow, and the emotion made the longer quiet parts more interesting. It did not fit into the stereotype of the usual DC universe. To me that means viewers need to into this film with an open mind.With three previous nominations, Joaquin Pheonix took home an Oscar for his performance as Arthur Fleck. You could say the casting for this movie was very well thought out. With well-known names such as Robert De Niro, it's no wonder the actors in this film were well received. Joaquin Pheonix also did extensive research on mental health and psychology to understand his character and get the Joker's laugh just right. You can see the work he put in as you watch Arthur Fleck try to do everyday things.The Joker 2019 was nominated for many Oscars including best picture, best director, best cinematography, best film editing, and more. It only took home two of the eleven it was nominated for, best actor and best original music score. Which is easy to see, given the amazing performance by Joaquin Pheonix. I really think his study of the role and mental illnesses that Joker suffers from made it what it is. He really gave his all and you could not see Joaquin Pheonix anywhere in the Jokers face.The Joker film made many achievements with its release. They had a budget of $62.5 million to create this film and they grossed over $1 billion, making it the first R-rated film to do so. It was the sixth highest grossing film of 2019 and the 31st highest grossing film of all time. You could say it was worth the budget. I do see how this movie draws people in, it's a combination or Joker fans, Joaquin Pheonix fans, and people who were interested in the mental health standpoint of the movie. I could see how so many different walks off life were attracted to the box office release.""If there is one clear message in Joker, it's that society needs to do more to support its poor and those in need of psychological and medical care. Arthur tries to hold down a job and take his medicine to make himself better and hold his worst impulses at bay."" says Forbes. Which is probably my biggest problem with the movie. The world doesn't owe you anything, whether you have a disability or not; you are responsible for your own actions. Going to therapy is supposed to teach you to ""make yourself better and hold your worst impulses at bay"". There are obliviously conditions that make a person do things that are out of their control though they are still responsible for the things they have done. Especially when the thing you've done is taking another person's life.Heath Ledger vs. Joaquin Phoenix, a disclaimer is necessary before we compare the two characters as their films are extremely different and in turn the feel of the movie. Though I do think it fair to compare specifically Heath Ledgers Joker because of the similarities in psychotic mannerisms and actions. In terms of how scary they are I'd have to give it to Heath Ledger. This may be because Joaquin Pheonix played a much younger version of the character, but he only kills the people who wronged him vs. Heath Ledger's Joker would scare me if I saw him walking down the street. Heath's victims have a wider range than Joaquin's, Heath is also more developed and has a clear intent and to me that makes him scarier. I also think that Heath Ledger's Joker, even though he didn't have as much screen time, captivated the audience. Joaquin's Joker is interesting, and he deserves every award he's one for this role. Heath's Joker just drew you in every time he was on the screen and made the role legendary even though he had less screen time than Batman. For these reason's Heath Ledger takes the cake in my opinion.In conclusion, the movie itself was amazing. We can appreciate Joaquin Phoenix's' interpretation of the role and the way he gave Joker an origin we've never seen before. I think where the film got lost was the message of the movie. There didn't feel like there was any point to it at the end of the day. You walk out of the theater feeling like you're in a black hole of sadness. Would I ever see it again? No. Would I tell people to never go see this movie? Again no. I would warn my friends of the content, so they are aware then leave the choice up to them. I think my biggest issue is with the makers of the movie, for taking viewers on such a dark journey with no real meaning behind it. Then being so defensive when people asked them to issue trigger warnings. It seems they were trying to get any reaction they could for this movie, whether it be good or bad. You're left at a sort of middle ground where the movie was good, but I never want to see it again."
4449,The acting in this movie was great but it's not the Joker story it's just a story of mental health issues I know that people find it amazing but for me it's just a good Movie but not the DC joker I know
4450,Never thought I'd get to see a film where Robert DeNiro gets SHOT & KILLED! Woo hoo!
4451,I thought it was a good film and I'm looking forward to joker 2 if there's going to be a second one
4452,"The best part of this movie was Joaquin's talent as a performer. He was truly at his best. He was believable and, while I don't actually relate to his character, I felt his pain when people hurt him. Incredible acting which alone deserved a 10.Unfortunately, I wasn't as impressed by certain aspects of the storyline. I don't mind a fresh look at a character's history, but not if it means that what I already know about them and their world is so different that it's hard to reconcile them. In the end, I could blur details and accept the plot, but it doesn't feel the same as if it just fit and made sense and was perfect. Hey, I'm OCD. Details are never minor for me.This movie made me sad for a reason other than a broken man shattering though. My respect for Bruce's parents and his father's legacy are injured by this fresh look at their past. If Thomas Wayne wanted to help fix Gotham, he should have considered ways to help reduce poverty which is something that would have improved crime. Instead, he pointed fingers at the poor and, when he assumed he was being retaliated against for it, he decided to run for mayor. I'm sorry, but why? To put himself in a position of direct power over them? Wayne was already a very wealthy, influential person in Gotham. What was he going to do to help the city that he couldn't already do without a political position? Hurt poor people even more and cause society to devolve even faster? So is he that ignorant or just another rich person? He's not the kind of father I could be proud of. I feel even sadder for Bruce than before."
4453,I'm not sure how I feel on the movie. I do like dark and twisted movies but what got me was the laughing that the joker did through the movie.
4454,"After a certain point it becomes callous. On the same reflexion but reality based Cuck does a better job. Because for all the hype, don't forget Joker is just DC comics character."
4455,"Holy crap! THIS is Joaquin Phoenix at his best! That said, and with all certainty, he deserved an oscar for his portrayal of Commodus in Gladiator AND lets not forget his portrayal as John Cash in Walk the Line but he was overlooked on both counts. Why? Is he not cute enough, is he a little off color for the members of the ""prestigious"" (cough) academy? Does he not kiss enough critic/Hollywood royalty butt? What is it? And for the record, I'm female who does not read about him or care who he's dating, nor do I care about the Batman series or comic books. I pretty much went into it blind other than hearing it was a good movie but THIS, this is beyond the limits of great acting and he deserves a best actor award. He blew it out of the park and no one and I mean no one could have done a better job. He is an elite actor in a class of a handful of others who completely transform themselves. If he gets passed over once again, I will never watch another academy awards show (not that I really do) nor will I put credence to their choices because it will confirm, it's just another paid-to-join boys club. The fact alone that the critics call it a ""dangerous"" movie is comical to say the least. We must have seen a different film or I'm just not being paid to post my review. *wink*This is a dark movie and IMO and simply put, it's a character study to the nines. It's not an action, over-the-top violent thriller/horror, or comedy. It's an intense journey into madness with all the components clearly at play. Driven by parental and societal violence/abuse a man loses his reasoning to make good decisions and spirals out of control while falling prey to emotional (or not), violent tendencies. All empathy, social conformity, and moral behavior cease to exist and in the end he finds a plethora of individuals who rush to his aid and who praise his new misanthropic nature.Ah yes, our Joker is finding his way and I loved this film and I believe I do, not only because it was well made on all fronts but because Phoenix, was brilliant!To all those who think his character is stupid. This is the beginning of his reign of terror, he is evolving into this new-found madness. He ""was"" a good man so this goes against his habitual grain so to speak. It's all about knowing what's happening to him. Some of you clearly don't understand what this movie is about and all I can say to that is, so sad for you."
4456,"As usual in a case where people leap to extremes, the truth is somewhere in the middle. Joker may make some people who feel marginalized feel more seen and more powerful, and they may act out in response. There are some ugly, self-serving messages in the movie, which is incongruously bent on creating sympathy for Batman's worst enemy and one of DC Comics' most notoriously callous mass murderers and atrocity architects. But love it or hate it, the film does spin up a tempting fantasy of persecution and relief, of embracing nihilism as a means of complete escape from a terrible world"
4457,"It is such a pity that this masterpiece cannot be enjoyed in China Mainland. However, I manage to watch this movie in the winter holiday of 2020.Many people appreciate this film of Todd Philips while others doubt the value of it. From my point of view, the Joker is just an ordinary member of the society who is suddenly forced to face his own alter ego, influenced by all the pains from the strangers to relatives and eventually turns into anger and crazy behaviors.To some extent, we are all jokers. For example, nearly all of us did experience constant unhappiness temporarily and get mad in some ways, and of course that kind of mad didn't necessarily mean crimes, but the hiden self, or the alter ego released and exploded."
4458,"The backdrop to what has previously been a bleek and empty landscape of Gotham has never felt more real. A city of its people, Gotham corrodes into an environment that is complimentary to the makeup of its mad clown, as it is the perfect foil for its eventual caped crusader. Hildur Guonadottir--who developed as eerie a score in the Chernobyl miniseries-- develops a score as beautiful as it is haunting. Phoenix not only holds his own among other greats to down the white paint, but stands apart in his rendition of a Joker who had never been more crisply defined. His is the most compelling of origin stories, one that provides us with not only the ""how,"" but the ""why"" behind the Joker's madness. Compelling and thought-provoking. A sign that the comic book genre can offer more beyond it's colorful source material."
4459,"Glad to see the other side of Gotham, but... with story being told I have a lot more questions (won't bore you with them) Just glad someone has trumped Heath Ledger's performance, he sounded like Al Franken dubbed his voice. Would like to see a sequel to answer some of the storylines, but I'm afraid it will be like who shot Hoffa going on and on and on. Phoenix killed it in this role, felt uneasy at times watching him and that is a good thing. Would rate it higher but all the hype didn't live up for me."
4460,"Joaquin was absolutely amazing and completely believable but I'm still struggling to understand wtf point they were trying to make.
Like is this about the ills of society from the perspective of an abused, mentally ill man or was it sending the message that if you are an abused, mentally ill man that the answer is to kill everyone ?
I dunno. I'm by no means a closed minded person who takes issue with violence in film but it's the subtext I have an issue with.
I have it a 5/10 because Joaquin was a solid 10, the film was a 1 so I split the difference."
4461,"Joker is in truth a great movie, I love how DC have gone from trying to create this really gritty cinematic universe in order to catch up with Marvel Studios, to making their own films.Besides Thanos (to some extent) Joker is probably the only villlian I've ever routed for. We see how society can break down a man and what it can potentially lead to. The movie takes inspiration from the comic ""The Killing Joke"" we can see elements from it really jump out on screen.The story is so well executed, we see Arthur Fleck as a clown trying to make a living, we see how he falls in love (or so he thinks) we see how he kills for the first time and in a way discover himself. We see how people agree with him and appose the corruption that Gotham and society face.The laughing condition that Arthur has is very good, when you step back and look it from a different view we see that he mostly only laughs when he's uncomfortable and it comes out really high. Whenever Arthur feels like he doesn't fit in his comes out with the high laugh and when he feels comfortable he dances, I find that in a way very interesting.The score is brilliant, that small theme Joker has is just pure brilliance, it makes you so uncomfortable and it just makes you question what's about to happen.I especially love the twists and makes you question if anything you saw was actually real.
For people who haven't seen it: ""you wouldn't get it""The cinematography is brilliant, the cinematographer really knows how to make people feel uncomfortable.I gave this a 5 star, I feel like it's for the most part brilliant. I especially love the scenes that try and tell us this is real but we find out it isn't."
4462,"Good acting.
And I see MJ in the actor when he dances on the stairs."
4463,"I was really late to the game on this one and kept seeing shots of this film and spoilers every which way I looked. After finally seeing it, I can say I don't believe it should be as much of a cultural phenomenon as it is.The production value and acting are superb. This is a unique character that is relatable in the most uncomfortable ways. This movie poses very important questions and forces you to choose sides, putting you in between a rock and a hard place and that is it's value. I do believe it will be one that is rewatched and shown to further generations, however I think many people are lying and just being sheep when they say they absolutely love it and it's one of their favorite films. Ironically that's the whole idea behind the film, are you just another one of the flock, do you stand out, is your voice worth hearing? I know mine is unpopular opinion but I think it's worth hearing so don't be afraid to speak out and say you don't think this is the best of the best.I give it a 7 because it's great but at times I lost interest, maybe it's because the character doesn't resonate as well with me as it does others but becoming uninterested in a film is a major red flag for me and being that this is ""The best of 2019!"" as many say, I expected more.Maybe if I'd seen it in October I would've felt differently but that's my analysis, thanks for coming and remember, that's life."
4464,"I guess I am just burned out on supposed ""cautionary tales"" featuring anarchy, mayhem and dystopia. This movie has excellent production values and awesome acting, but WHAT A DOWNER! It was nice, however, to see senile bozo De Niro in such an appropriate role."
4465,"If you are looking for Phoenix astonishing performance, you won't be disappointed; but Todd Phillips? Beware Christopher Nolan! And Bradley Cooper as a producer? That's why this movie is basically a masterpiece in every possible way...This is why you go the movies; this is the main reason to make a movie: to create a cinematographic memory that will last forever...BRAVO!!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏"
4466,"Rarely does a film exceed the hype like Joker!it always puts me off when I see rave reviews from critics about a film and really wasn't expecting this film to be as good as it turned out.The acting by Joaquin Phoenix is a masterful performance, detailing every nuance of the Arthur character.It sucks you right in to his world and keeps you there for the whole two hours or so - which went by so quickly.If you are a fan of quality film this is certainly one to watch."
4467,"I now think I could've actually seen it while it was playing in cinemas. It was really a somber, dark and disturbing drama film that only got better with every passing second. Joaquin Phoenix has delivered a really outstanding performance, and now I really believe it, having seen it myself! Also, kudos to Todd Phillips for not only directing it brilliantly but also for keeping it less than 2 hours and focusing on just the important parts.Joker is not a superhero film despite being set in the same universe as Batman. It's a very, very dark film that is just hard to ""enjoy"". It's entertaining and captivating, but not in the way you might think. There are no ""wow"" moments in it, and all I could feel was sad at times for Arthur before he became the Joker.Joker is definitely not for you if you're easily turned off by some graphic gore or afraid of disturbing characters. If Todd intended to show us the human beneath the psychopath, I'd say he won, at least for more than half of the movie's duration. Joker has got a strong performance from Phoenix, intense conversations and also some really gorgeous visuals. This film is like a comic book that turns out to be a pretty good character study."
4468,"I was really looking forward to this movie because of all the hype but sadly I was disappointed. It was pretty average, predictable abs slow. Worth a watch but very overrated."
4469,"The story did bring up awareness of mental illness. Acting of Phoenix is phenomenal. Look at the poster first impression is a horror, and indeed it's a horror deep down of human dark side with tragic story behind. Mix of all the elements did have chance to win Oscar."
4470,"This movie is at it's best a great insight on how people can be total jerks to other people and how it can affect the ones they act that way towards. It can send some people off the deep end of the world, to to the fact that you nevermind know who, what, when, how, or why the one being bullied, picked on, or shamed by other people in society. I as a parent recommend this movie and I recommend you show it to your children so they can see what can happen to people that are being bullied, or picked on even though this is just one example of what can happen in real life because you never know what effect your actions or words have on others."
4471,"There are moments in ""Joker"" when the central character, Arthur ""Happy"" Fleck, reflects on how miserable he is. He acknowledges that ""all I have are negative thoughts,"" and he consistently recognizes how the outside world is cruel, insensitive, and decaying from within, due the loss of a moral compass.Is the bleak depiction of Gotham City, the world that Joker helps to destroy through anarchy, may lie one of the reasons why ""Joker"" earned over $1 billion in box office receipts: audiences have a direct, visceral reaction to the film's ugly environment. A central image in the film is the ""super rats"" that have infested Gotham City. The rats are enabled by another metaphor in the heaps of garbage that litter the streets. It is hard not to see a parallel with the current state of Los Angeles and San Francisco.One of the most fascinating characters in the film is Thomas Wayne, the man who Arthur believes at one point was his long-lost father. Arthur sought out Mr. Wayne, hoping for a little compassion. For his efforts, Arthur received only more abuse and the knowledge that his mother was a pathological liar and had horribly abused him after she adopted him. Still, the film turns on the insensitive treatment of Arthur by Mr. Wayne, who thinks of him as nothing more than one of the blue collar workers he calls ""clowns."" In 2016, a former politician referred to the same crowd as ""deplorables.""Another interesting character is the late-night television host and Arthur's idol, Murray Franklin. But any bond of trust between the two characters is destroyed when Franklin mocks Arthur's stand-up routine at Pogo's and invites him on the show to humiliate him even more. The film's best scene was Arthur's appearance on one of Franklin's programs. In the bonus track of the DVD, ""Joker's"" director, Todd Phillips, described how actor Joaquin Phoenix gave him a myriad number of different takes for Arthur's dynamic entrance on Franklin's show.A shortcoming of Phoenix's performance was his interpretation of Arthur's laugh. The primary character trait of Arthur is the laugh, which works in counterpoint to his melancholy. But the laugh sounded like the actor's laugh, as opposed to coming out of the character's soul. The ""laughing fits"" should have been much more painful and disturbing for both Arthur and the characters around him.While the musical score of ""Joker"" has received acclaim, the thundering, epic sounds and the protracted musical interludes added to the mood, but slowed down the pacing of the film. Phillips' direction was at its best in the excellent locations and the gritty style that recalled the underbelly of New York captured in ""The French Connection."" Both films are compelling works of cinema. But ""The French Connection"" is the one that will stand the test of time."
4472,"The Stream: Takes unbelievably long to get moving and then supremely predictable.The Big Screen: Joaquin delivers an uneven performance but worth watching.The Final Bill: Joker is an overhyped film that will create some conversations about mental health issues in society.-S2S: Movie ReviewKnock, knock. Who's there? Stream to Big Screen. Stream to Big Screen, who? Stream to Big Screen the best site for movie reviews on the internet! Corny? I think not. Welcome back everyone! This week we were able to view the highly anticipated movie, Joker, starring Joaquin Phoenix. Joker is a standalone origin film of many people's favorite DC Comics villain. The movie is set in the worst of times in Gotham where violence is rampant, civil unrest is prevalent, and the rodent population is no joke. This movie follows Phoenix as the main character, Arthur Fleck. Arthur is a young man longing to fit in and aspiring to be a comedian but is dealing with a bevvy of issues, primarily mental illness. The film leads us through Arthur's path to becoming the titular Joker.While this movie is titled Joker, the theme/takeaway from this movie is no joke. Ultimately, this movie hits way too close to home for American society presently. The bullied, belittled, forgotten person in society deals with mental illness without an appropriate support system, and he has access to a gun. This storyline has become an all too familiar in mainstream media today. For this reason, Joker is a very good conversation piece. But didn't we come to see a movie based on a comic book? This isn't what I wanted! Well, this is important to know. DON'T go into this movie expecting a comic book like story or a connection to the comics, other than the name.With that said, Warner Bros. couldn't have found a better or more experienced lead actor than Phoenix. Phoenix definitely has practice acting like a power seeking maniac begging to be remembered. I'm looking at you Commodus! From the beginning to the end, Phoenix takes us through every single range of emotion Arthur experiences. It truly is quite impressive. Phoenix's acting and the movie provide a great feeling of anxiety, not necessarily suspense, throughout. Unfortunately, the director either held Phoenix back or chose to feature too many early movie boring set up scenes. When Phoenix acts his craziest, the movie is epic but there is just far too little of it to get over the boring parts. In a way, I felt deceived by the intense commercials and trailers. We've been waiting for nearly a year to see this movie. Yes, the movie provides a few intense moments but far too few. And, far too little of Zazie Beetz! Honestly, they could've interchanged her with any actress to do the same thing. Nevertheless, her presence was still welcomed.And then when I wasn't bored, I was predicting exactly what was supposed to be a surprise or twist in the movie. I'm not sure if it was the scene selection or a purposeful directorial decision, but at times the same scenes just didn't make sense when I was watching them. Eventually, my suspicions were confirmed and I just said ,""duh!""All of that said, Joker delivers in some aspects (I didn't even mention the great score in the movie) but ultimately will let you down. Joaquin does a good job as the Joker, but he's never going to be regarded like a Heath Ledger once the dust settles. Try to check this movie out at a matinee time, if your a big Joker/DC fan. Everyone else, you may be disappointed in a matinee price but for a reasonable price it's worth it or an early streaming rental"
4473,Amazing!!! Toadd Phillips did a great job at making the film Joker the lighting skills in the film are very artistic the camera movements are marvelouse and the acting of Joaquin Phoneix is astonishing he nailed a one of a kind Joker that we havent seen since Heath Ledger. Now im not saying that Joaquin did a better Joker then Heath but he did like Heath creat his own unique character. I recomand to film students to not only watch that film but to also to study it you can learn alot from that film.
4474,"Great movie about a guy with a mental ilness, who also happens to work as a clown, spiral downwards and be consumed by his condition. However this is NOT the Joker! The Joker is an evil genius. This guy demonstrates none of the genius traits which would allow him to be running any movement/criminal organisation. Unless there's some unrealistic character change any sequel showing this will be completely fake. The Joker in this is just crazy. It was good though but quite rightly left everything open to interpretation as to what actually happened and what didn't."
4475,"Cinematography, camera work, scenery, acting, music... all perfect! You can pause this movie at any random point and the frame you get will look like a piece of art. You can start to play this movie from any random point and it will be a fantastic scene. Movie's flow, pacing, atmosphere that created... all great. With that being said, story of the movie is not that deep as people likes to believe. I think people wants to believe that because movie is great, but story is really not that deep at all. Character development is not great either, it's like people will call any villian making story a good character development. It's funny that I felt more sympathetic towards Thomas Wayne and Murray despite seeing all that Joker had to go through. It's simply because I know neither Murray or Wayne are on the wrong side in this story.
So yeah, it's a great movie and a cinematographic masterpiece maybe but this movie in general is not a masterpiece and it's overhyped."
4476,"All though the movie brought me an atom of clarity but it's not the kind of movie I would watch twice, I was bored shirtless during the first 1hr of the movie but the last 30min was interesting, it had a very slow build up.To be sincere, if this movie wasn't called The Joker or imaging we didn't know the joker at all... It would have been like a regular everyday movie.... You people should not be blinded, regardless of anything.
Thank you."
4477,"A great movie that keeps popping into your mind days/weeks later. Thought provoking and powerful and top class acting. It's representation of mental illness, trauma and how society shapes a person was hard hitting and powerful. I cant wait to watch this movie again"
4478,"The question kept me confused is, why would a shooting crime cause the revolution in this city? And, why Joker became the God of the citizens. I think it didn't make sense."
4479,"The movie tells the story of a court jester.It does refer to Wayne and tells that Joker was his other boy.With only one or two violent scenes you ' ll enjoy yourselves,if yu re lucky enough to get tickets."
4480,"For those People they like more action(the movies of his opponent batman have more action , its not very good movie.
but for those they like dramas and Deep meaning, messages and how life is its very good.
Shows that
1) bad abuse in child age, could be the reason for depress and psycholog ical problems.
2)That the society Stop very important aid funds to save money
3)And that in despair, and economic inequality promotes chaos, violence and revolution, and the People create and support evil idols like Hitler and joker"
4481,"Was it well made? Yes was it well acted? Exceptionally Did I enjoy it? Hell no.It was dark and depressing. I watch movies to escape. I watch movies to be entertained. I watch movies to laugh, cry and feel good. This left me with money of that. I felt sick. Uneasy.Amd yes you will have the wannabes writing their critical reviews suggesting it's about social commentary and mental health issues .... it's a super hero/villain movie!I don't watch horror movies for the same reason I didn't like this movie. As I said at the outset, it was well made and exceptionally acted but it wasnt entertaining in the slightest. It was horrific to watch. It was like witnessing someone having a breakdown ... and what's entertaining about that?!!!"
4482,"A Dark, humour and disturbing journey of Arthur fleck. Everyscene was like a filament in a bulb. OMG! That smile makes me crazy, I can't even recognise the spot where he used to smile. That laugh is as contagious as anything can get!""JOKER""......this journey never looked unreal though, unlike that of a hulk or a spider man....as this journey was quite human, logical and beautifully graphed and captured(of course) !!!!! IF HEATH HAS GIVEN HIS LIFE FOR THE JOKER THEN I WOULD SAY PHOENIX HAS GIVEN A LIFE TO THE JOKER !!"
4483,"When i first heard about ""Joker"", i was excited. I thought using a very popular character to depict descent into madness is a pretty good idea. When i heard Todd Philips was gonna direct it, i was a bit sceptical. He never made this kind of movie. But from the movies i've seen of him, he is a competent director. He didn't disappoint. ""Joker"" is his finest work. I hope he gets good offers in the future. ""Joker"" is a competently helmed, beautifully made movie. Which is one of it's strengths. Though it's not flawless.Before talking about the flaws. I have to give due applause to Joaquin Phoenix. He did one of those transformative works, showing his acting prowess, in such a royal way...this will be something that will be talked about in coming times. He gorgeously put on the screen - his characters vulnerabilities, his anguish and his need to do something to spark life in his life. Joaquin's Joker is a ride to behold.But...i don't think the script properly holds up his performance. By no means it's a bad script, it's superior than most. But here's the thing, this movie is dealing with some sharp subjects. I felt like it failed to uphold them properly. It did partially though. I saw two things in this movie. Arthur's journey towards chaos and the city he is in, that city's impoverished people's journey with him. When it came to Arthur, the movie did a pretty good job. It made a proper case for him to become someone like Joker. The things he went through, the revelations he found out about him, the conditions he already had ...yeah, i can see that throwing someone over the edge. There are one or two things i felt like could've been emphasised more. But nothing is flawless. So, good job movie, on that front. But as for the city's journey with him...i felt like the movie didn't properly illustrate that. The movie needed to make a strong case for the city's madness, as much as it had to do for Arthur's. The approach they took, it just didn't do it for me. I would say ""V for Vendetta"" made better case for this type of unrest. There were also a couple of weird, kinda shoehorned in scene that disrupted the flow of the movie for me. I felt like the movie kinda dropped the ball in the last scenes, after Arthur got on television, those scenes were weak and didn't give the movie a strong finish.So, i would watch this for Joker himself and Joaquin, but as for the larger case the movie alluded to, i thought it was murky. But this movie is still important, it's very different in the comic book adaptation movie crowd. If this encourages producers and directors to take more risks, i am all for it."
4484,"I watched the movie two times in a cinema and every time i see more than 20 person leave the hall in the last 20 minutes of the movie!, there's no interesting story, it's just disgusting and freak story when joker kill his mother and also killed too much persons for nothing, i don't know i don't know how to explain, but i expected a stronger movie for joker as person as hero as new movie millions of people around the world were waiting for it!.
In general it's good but very good or beautiful and we can't compare it with a legendary movies, maybe we can compare it with top 100 movies, maybe i say maybe! :)"
4485,"This is a really well done movie with great acting that brings an iconic character to life better than any movie ever has been done before. My only gripe with the movie is that despite reminding you throughout that this is a comic book movie and character by plugging in people and places from the source material, in the end it never makes me fully believe that this could ever be a formidable evil genius to the main superhero he will one day face down. Perhaps if he had done something extraordinarily devastating at the end that required a glimpse of the genius to come. As it stands now, I can't see him ever escaping the nuthouse and needing someone to wipe his ass while he is there. Still a solid 9 if you disregard where this character is supposed to go in the future"
4486,"From the start to finish this is a sad story, frankly it makes the murder of Thomas and Martha Wayne a funny little joke. With each and every psychological blow to Arthur Fleck a bit of himself gets chipped away like the outer layer of a lotus; so that we can find what's left of him inside that too in such a beautiful way. You can miss a heartbeat but not this flick."
4487,The perfect character sketch. Schocking yet intruiging. An unfortunate series of circumstances allowing his mania to manifest. This is one of those movies where I'll watch an equal length in fan theory clips.
4488,"After watch this movie, i think very hard ""did i hurt them"""
4489,"Scorsese's this is not.
Similarities may arise, but this is it's own machination.The pace, development, and growth/maturity/gestation of the main character is brilliant.
While critisising aspects of our society, its focus is on our past and possible future mistakes.
All while weaving this story of a unhinged man falling down a hole and losing all he had/thought he had.
Brilliant in its pacing.
Great for families used to violence....aka adult families.
But take enough for the person who doesnt like gore or over the top slasher gimmicks.Do you smile in adversity?
Do you smile when things go wrong?
Do you smile, just to smile?
Do you smile......to mask?Watch it!"
4490,"Let's say it this way: Joker persona is irrelevant, it's more like a subproduct of a man gone mad. But you already knew that. Could be a common John Doe (in this case Arthur) without any comic universe related. Honestly, DC universe here is almost inexistent, aside from some Wayne family moments. But again, you already knew that. If you saw Taxi Driver, you will leave the cinema feeling with a solid dejavu that you've seen it before and done better. If you haven't seen Taxi Driver (or King of Comedy) then you should see it immediatly. Joaquin Phoenix IS the movie for all its painfful 2 hrs until it snaps to Joker. A quite impressive performance from J.Phoenix perhaps one of his best work. Turning into Joker is just...well.. you won't forget Heath Ledger let's be honest, but you will admire this new clown. It's more of a thriller and moral/social defying story that anything else. And that's ok.Just don't expect anything. If you like superhero/vilain movies, there are no suuperheros, no awesome CGI or explosions or guys wearing tight pants. If you're a DC comic fan, go with an open-mind and don't judge it for not being ""Killing Joke"", ya know, THE story this movie should be all about and hold the title franchise. If you're a DCU movie fan, you may now breath in relief, as DC name earns one more count for ""Quality / Realism VS CGI"", that Nolan feel. However, it's a different approach.The story overall is hard to comment on, really. I saw ""King of Comedy"" by DeNiro, so that's the main plot for the Joker movie. Period. The similarities are remarkable and i'm sure they meant it. As the main character slowly goes angry and judges society? Yeah, that's Taxi Driver 101. It is what it is.It'll will cause hype and the majority of people actually will love it. Every millenial that didn't have the chance to follow Scorcese/DeNiro work before."
4491,"I love films like ""a beautiful mind"" and ""shutter Island"" because it portrays mental illness in such a way that you actually learn about the suffering that mental illness creates.
Joker is another one of these movies, and for me Joker went to the top.
Drama at it's absolute finest."
4492,"I have notice a lot of people try to draw comprising which (in my view) are completely missed.
This is not a typical DC/superhero type movie. It has nothing to do with Heath Ledger. Would he be proud? Probably. He was brilliant in his own way; however he stared in a DC movie and was your typical Joker (having said that he executed it brilliantly).Now, this movie is different - it is a case study of mental illness. Very deep and heavy going, nonetheless accurate and beautiful in a way. It may as well be considered a movie on its own, without any connections with Gotham, the Joker character, the comic books etc etc. If anything - Taxi Driver (1976) and the King of Comedy (1982) are closer to it than any of the Batman or other DC shows you have seen in the past.Joaquin Phoenix is the best actor of his generation. By far and undoubtedly.
What he did in this film is remarkable. I left the cinema absolutely speechless and moved at the same time.
It is a masterpiece!"
4493,But by far not the cineastic gem that I have expected. The story is way to formulaic to impress and its twists are therefore not very surprising. But Phoenix acting is really worth to watch it. that is it.
4494,"Unnerving , Strange and deeply depressing. Yet the vision that unfolds in front of your eyes is one that will leave its mark on you in more ways than you'd care to allow for. Whether you like it or not is inconsequential. It's an experience for the ages... it touches ever so subtlety and honestly on one of the biggest issues currently facing modern day society; mental health! Should we or shouldn't we? do we step in? but how can we? He's strange, she's wallowing, they creep me out, ... this is a film as important as it is dangerous because our protagonist finds his voice and value through violence . Did we create the monster? Was it you or was it me? was it the society that breeds the rejected through carelessness approval and reverence of the shallowly beautiful and the selfishly powerful. It's the questions that this masterpiece of filmmaking poses and even dares to raise. The world is fractured and shown through the eyes of Gotham's allegory of the downtrodden and forgotten that litter the streets while the privileged determine ""what's best"" for them. Only one that can rise from the gutter amongst them all can truly understand ... only he who dares to push back in the most harshest way can deliver the feast that could satiate the starving masses.
Joaquin Phoenix delivers something that has only been seen, in what now seems in small doses when looking back, an all guns blazing performance and dishes up a sad and disturbing character that you can't draw your eyes away from. Peering in as he delves into the depths of despair as though he must have had some sort of experience of hidden trauma in his life that could only be defined as horrific. He deserves every accolade there is under this hot sun that has continually shunned its rays away from such a desolate and pathetic character, a character that has the paradoxical ability to lead through his madness.
I'll say it clear, along with the rest of the wanna be critics in this vast industry of movie appreciation... Joker is a film that has the ability to leave its mark on you for a very long time, it's simply a masterpiece, a timely reminder that the forgotten will be remembered for good or for bad and that minds tampered with can bite back and bite back with a vengeance! Like it or not is inconsequential, watch it you must! To better understand the mind of the person that causes the atrocious crimes we see in the nightly news, whether you like it or not, it drives , it is dangerous, whether the movie makers like it or not It walks the tight rope of contempt and sympathy, even dare I say glorification, it could inspire and become the modern day ""Catcher in the rye"" its just that powerful. It leaves and impacts whether you like it or not! It doesn't leave you indifferent , it can't. And if it does , you got distracted and the joke is on you as you may be in danger of having forgotten a dangerous mind that may be closer than you'd like to think! Put on a smile on your face and go out and get disturbed... this is why we watch movies!"
4495,"In recent years, superhero movies have filled the theaters. This film is unlike any of them. Gritty and realistic it's label as dangerous by the media is well-deserved. This is not because of excessive violence but rather, it is because Arthur Fleck is such a relatable and sympathetic character for so many people.He's not a full-blown psychotic nor is he a calculated psychopath. He is a generally polite, lonely and isolated guy who is in that in between. He's healthy enough to work a job but not healthy enough to thrive or excel. His head is just barely above water, so to speak. His unraveling throughout the movie has less to do with a worsening illness like schizophrenia and more to do with the realistic actions of the society around him.By brilliantly using an accurate depiction of society's actions as a mechanism for his development, it creates a story that rings true. It also creates a deeply sympathetic and almost justified character. Unlike Heath Ledger's agent of chaos Joker, this Joker is fighting against a society that has genuinely failed and mistreated him (and so many others, as the ending shows).All in all, I would say this movie was a masterpiece. It explained a realistic and interesting backstory for a character who is really part of the fabric of American culture. It also highlighted a very overlooked segment of society and looked at real issues that they are facing."
4496,If you ever want the question answered on where the joker came from then this movie with answer it. Phoenix was perfect for the role and was spot on in ever way. I left the cinema feeling that it fitted in with all the other Batman movies ( not the one with jack Nicolson). I would have given it 10 /10 not for the death of Thomas Wayne. That just didn't sit right with me.If you are a Batman fan. You have to see this movie.
4497,"Every day we see acts of extreme violence but rarely we reflect on the origin of such acts and study the characters behind them. Joker is a spot on character study which focuses on Arthur's life and his transformation into Joker. Director Todd Philips takes the chaotic and unorganized mind of Joker and make the entire narration equally unorganized and unreliable.
Todd Phillips carefully walks the line between tragedy and comedy and impeccable acting of Joaquin Phoenix makes sure that each emotion is captured in a single scene. The transformation into Joker was very well acted through an improvised dance scene in the bathroom (and many after) which reflects freedom and confidence Arthur was feeling after the acts of killing the vicious Wall Street men. This shows how well soundtrack, acting and directing are integrated throughout the movie. Especial kudos to the cinematography which emphasizes the loneliness and darkness Arthur was feeling throughout the movie.
Arthur draws depression & loneliness of Travis Bickle from ""Taxi Driver"", anger & frustration of Howard Beale from ""Network"" (all the characters based on 1970s America). Movie truly reflects a sick society in which a broken and mentally ill character was abused in childhood and later was regularly marginalized by society because of his mental illness.
With so much bad happening around the world it is easy to get mad as hell. Media and people are still talking about negative effects acts of violence shown in the movie but I rarely find anyone talking about lack of attention towards mental illness across the world and how a weak mind if put into situations like these can turn out to be a menace to the society. Because of the sheer performance by Joaquin and a huge risk taken by Todd this movie deserves Oscar nomination at the least and a rating of 8/10."
4498,"I have seen so many negative reviews of this film. Seems like they are so butt hurt. It's the woke culture that's hates this. This is an amazing film, from the beginning to the end. The character development is outstanding. As a peace of art it is quality. As a super hero movie, it is amazing. Everyone who hates this film needs to find a safe place and write in their mood journal lol"
4499,"This is, in my opinion, the greatest movie ever made. Everything about this movie is my new favourite thing from a movie. The story, the score, the cinematography and Joaquin.... holy crap Joaquin Phoenix. He's always been one of my favourite actors by now he's my favourite. This is easily the best acting I've seen in a film. All the supporting cast are amazing as well. This will for sure win oscars, and if Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win then they will have screwed him over again."
4500,"So many aspects of this film were just superb. The score, the constant feeling of depression in Gotham, the subtle introduction of the Wayne family, the very real mental breakdown of Arthur, the reasons why and the sadness that went with that, the final thirty minutes which I thought were very well done.The only negative (and it is a very tiny negative) was they could have maybe had the occasional flashback into Arthur's childhood (him being chained to the radiator etc) which would have added to the tension in the build up to killing his adoptive mother.More than anything else though Phoenix is simply brilliant. You know what he is going to turn into, you know he has deep rooted issues that will turn him into a psychopathic killer, rapist and armed robber to name but a few but you simply cannot help but feel for him. It reminded me somewhat of Revenge of the Sith in the sense. Phoenix displayed so many different emotions and skills throughout this movie that you could argue this is a career defining performance.This movie is depressing and full of sadness yet simply outstanding."
4501,"Joker takes an uncompromisingly bleak look into a warped mind that is gradually undone by reckless decisions and societal let down. Exploring the concept of ""one bad day"" that is reminiscent of Alan Moore's seminal The Killing Joke graphic novel, writer-director Todd Phillips holds nothing back in his gritty and pulpy adaptation of a well-known DC-comics character. For the first time and perhaps not the last, the Joker character is given a deeply thorough characterization that makes him both repulsive and endearing/sympathetic often in the same scene. It cannot be overstated the sheer method-acting work that lead Joaquin Phoenix invests into the role as his commitment is boundless.Thanks to some very adept direction, cinematography and scripting, Phoenix is given a proper sandbox to let loose and chew scenery and, by movie's end, you truly feel for him in all his unhinged madness. Phoenix effectively mines emotional shades of the Joker that previous live action actors weren't able to accomplish. His portrayal isn't of the anarchic terrorist bend that the late Heath Ledger exhibited nor is he the campy, mustache-twirler of Jack Nicholson or César Romero. Phoenix gifts us with a truly relatable depiction that is totally in sync with our uncertain times.On the production front, Philips takes a welcome stylistic page out of vintage Martin Scorsese's playbook as he emulates the qualities of his canon while not being a direct carbon-copy. As is expected, the Gotham City of Philip's world looks, feels and behaves like the turbulent New York City of the 1970s and 1980s as his attention to detail is astonishing and unnerving. Altogether, ""Joker"" succeeds as a commentary on stigma with mental illness as well as what it means to be a misunderstood citizen of a society that has lost its way and just how many people fall through the cracks without getting the requisite care and consideration that we all deserve. It's a necessary watch and one that will leave you contemplating long after the credits roll."
4502,"Well, I was writing a really long review, and I have put a lot of effort into it, but I accidentally fliped my phone screen and it just got deleted. Anyway, I really enjoyed the movie, regular joker was way better than a sexy joker in suicide squad. Also the movie starts off pretty slow, but trust me, it's worth the wait to find out the secrets of Joker. Long story short, Joker (2019) is a great movie and I highly recommend it to everyone with steel nerves, It's not for everyone because it's very depressing"
4503,"It´s ok if they wanted to give this movie an Scorsese´s Taxi-Driver vibe, but was too obvious at times...
At the same time, I think the Joker deserved a better Origin story...but I hate Origin stories with some characters as Marvel´s Wolverine or DC´s Joker,so...I never liked the classic comic-book The Killing Joke for the same reason, so maybe I´m not the most objective.
The 7 points I give this movie are because Phoenix, he is the dude who looks more like the Joker I ever seen, if he wasn't in this movie, it would have been less points.."
4504,"First review.I have not seen this kind of character development since Breaking Bad. It's breathtaking - interesting, disgusting, flamboyant, heartbreaking, motivating?; And a ton of other adjectives come I to mind. The story belongs to Arthur Fleck, the portrayal is one of the most iconic experiences, since... Well, ever?No spoilers from me, just - for the sake of loving movies (no need to be a true die hard superhero fan) watch ""Joker""Saw the movie and hour ago, and still fighting of the cobwebs."
4505,I never tough or even know how they do review on imdb until i wanted deeply to put my review on this movie i created imdb account just to put my review and never ever had the motivation to do it on all the other masterpiece i ve seen this isnt a movie this was something that manipulate all our pshycology it s been two days that i ve watched this movie and i still watching it in my head i even think to go watch it again what i never did before it s a movie that should be watched two to five times until we get it right
4506,"So many people want this movie to do bad but the truth is, this film is the best we've probably had in the last 10 years! Don't like joker? don't watch it but stop complaining about nonsense!"
4507,"Released AFTER rave reviews, with much fanfare and a deceptive buildup (the trailers only showed Joker as a victim) Joker is many things. A good piece of art and storytelling, a depressing cautionary tale, a moral sewer that is also entertaining, a dark harbinger of things to come as more ... We also have a cynical directors effort where he stole several previous films ideas (Taxi Driver, Falling Down, others)....In Joker we witness the downward spiral of the highly symbolically named Arthur Fleck. An abused child who as an adult absurdly attempts to be a professional clown and stand up comic, despite the obvious fact that he is decidedly the opposite of funny. Gradually, Arthur's world unravels and he crosses the line into pure madness and mayhem. It is clear that the viewer is suppose to be sympathetic towards Arthur but the big question is, should we ? At what point should stop blaming society and give the individual responsibility for his actions ? Normal people should feel some sort of revulsion towards Arthur/Joker as the film progressed, but unfortunately many people uncritically root for him to the finish.
The ending is confusing. I think the director got cold feet and added the ambiguity in order to avoid an even rougher ending that was certain to inspire real life violence, which I would be surprised if it does not anyway. The director punted.
Joachuin Phoenix's performance/ interpretation of the anti-hero Joker is outstanding- this is actually the best part of the film. The main flaw in this tragedy is how the story near the end actually violated English literature 101 dictum of ""show, don't tell"" This is why I give it a 7.5
Joker's politics can be viewed from both a left and right perspective but what is almost never mentioned is how the movie indicts single motherhood for being the toxic societal ill that it is...Watch this movie and know that there untold thousands of real life Arthur Fleck's out there...you have been warned."
4508,"Normally acting filmed
The story its great.............."
4509,"Not your typical superhero genre movie. This movie could have cut out the Batman/DC connection and it would not change the movie at all. Then again, if it didn't have the Batman/DC connection, would anyone have seen this movie? Probably not. Yes it's violent but honestly, what does anyone expect?"
4510,"I see all these reviews suggesting Arthur Fleck is an incel but I haven't yet seen a single review justifying that categorisation of the character. Yes, he is single, white and like most single people doesn't want to be that. The missing part is he doesn't show any signs of misogyny nor racism. Furthermore, despite the fact that at least 4 mass murders committed in North America by men who either ""self-identified as incels or who had mentioned incel-related names and writings in their private writings or Internet postings"", Arthur Fleck's participation in the movement against the elites is by and large accidental as he did not kill the three ""Wall Street"" guys to make a political statement but it was rather an act of personal nature. That is not to say that he doesn't ride the wave that he unwillingly created by the end of the film but the original intention to incite mass violence was not there, nor any other negative connotations associated with the incel subculture. I fully agree that the film is a brilliant deconstruction of prevalent social and political narratives and whatever you think the true narrative is, you will be proven wrong in the next segment of the movie. Astonishing acting and score. A masterpiece."
4511,Outstanding performance by joaquin pheonix. Can be watched innfinite times
4512,"I went in to this movie with high hopes. I'm not an avid reader within the comic/graphic novel series of DC/Batman/Joker historically, but I've seen all of the previous films, the animated series, and had more than a handful of discussions with friends in the past related to those topics. Coming out of this movie with a friend our collective reaction was largely ""what did I just watch?"". To be fair, Joaquin Phoenix had one of the best dramatic performances I've ever seen. Nearly unequalled in how phenomenal he was. However, in the larger scheme of things this portrayal did not seem like the Joker & his story I've witnessed at any point in my almost 30 years of watching the battle between the Dark Knight and his maniacal & scheming foe.This comes across as an every man who has had a horrible life in pretty much every way imaginable. At multiple points during the film it was near impossible to not feel genuinely sorry for what Arthur Fleck was experiencing. In the end, the feeling both myself and my friend had was that of sorrow, empathy, and confusion.Unlike Ledger's Joker from The Dark Knight who is masterful in manipulating situations, people, and timing to his whim, Phoenix's joker is a simple man who merely exists while society laughs at him and tears him down bit by bit. While this may be an origin story, I fail to see how any element of this character could conceivably integrate to the Batman world, or the DC world at large. Bruce Wayne would very easily out maneuver Arther Fleck without much too much effort. If the intent is to make Fleck/Joker into a wild card who is nothing but unpredictable, that could be believable, but barely so.Granted, some could reasonably argue that the trait was present but never shown during this movie. I don't see it that way. If this is the telling of where he came from, what life events turned him into who he is, then the element of being strategic should have been shown now because that's not something that someone just suddenly develops. Even the ability for this character to understand how to make a simple bomb would be too challenging for his aptitude to be able to achieve.In the end this portrayal of Joker to me was far too close to the portrayal of a person on Making A Murderer, as opposed to the real life version of a comic book character. In my almost 40 years of life and several thousand movies watched, I've never had a cinematic experience like Joker. However, I've never seen a movie where my feeling of deliberately choosing to never see it again is as strong as it is with Joker. I've seen plenty of really bad movies which I would not want to watch again. But this Joker, I would go out of my way to deliberately avoid. Moreover, I would not recommend someone go see it."
4513,"I was excited about seeing this movie. And this movie exceeded my expectations. I did have my concerns. One of them being the very existence of the film. If you told me 5 years ago that joker would get his own solo movie without batman in it I wouldn't believe you. Another concern was that the reason Joker the best superhero villains, comic book villains, and just one of the best villains ever is you DON'T know his backstory or why he's crazy, so making an origin story about may imply that the studio doesn't understand the point of the character. And don't tell me that Jack Nicholson was a good Joker and he had a backstory. Because yes he was a good Joker but Tim Burton just made stuff up for the movie, it worked for 1989 but half the stuff in that movie isn't from the comics. And I'm not saying it's a bad movie because of that. Anyway that discussion is for another time. My final concern before seeing the film was, that all the other supervillain esc movies that came out before Joker were all bad and made the villains into heroes and save the world from blowing up, and it's a dumb blockbuster. For example: Venom and Suicide Squad. In Suicide Squad they end up saving the day and becoming the F list Avengers. Same thing with Venom except it's only one guy.While Joker makes you feel sympathy for the character and explain why he's insane you're not pro Joker by the end of it, you don't support him when he kills someone. This film does not portray him as hero, which I respect. This film is also exceptional at the bare essentials for a film. It has good writing, editing, direction, acting, tone, makeup, costume design, cinematography, plot and it had something to say. Joaquin Phoenix is the heart and soul of this movie and without him this film wouldn't have been nearly as good. I can't imagine someone else playing Joker in Phoenix's position. Another thing I should mention is this movie was so good it made me lookup interviews. The only other film I can think of where I looked up interviews recently was Thor: Ragnarok and I guess Stranger Things 3. I'm trying not to spoil all that much, but I can't not talk about the spoilers so if you haven't seen the movie yet then don't scroll down.SPOILERS
The twist that Arthur Fleck's (Joker's) mom said that Thomas Wayne was his son but it was later revealed that she was dilosinal was interesting. It was a little unnecessary but I thought it was clever. There is also political commentary on the lower class and higher classes of society and how they play into mental health. How they feel or don't feel about mental health. And near the end of the film you see Bruce Wayne and his parents run out the theater and one of Joker's followers has a gun and follows them to an alleyway.... I think you know the rest of the story. Now I want to talk about the steps by Arthur's apartment. Every time we see Arthur walk up those steps something bad happened before hand. We always see him walk up the steps carrying something using a fair amount of force. And at the end when he becomes The Joker, he is armed with this new confidence that he is never seen having before the film. And this time he's walking down the steps smiling and dancing, (the scene from the trailer) he found happiness. Throughout the film you see Arthur struggle constantly, so when you see him walking down the steps without a care in the world, in a strange way, you feel good for him. Another thing that happens around the second act of the film is Arthur gets invited to go on The Murray Franklin Show. Arthur has watched Murray for years and looks up to him because Arthur wants to be a comedian. And obviously Arthur is not mentally stable. So when he goes to this stand up show and watches other people do stand up, he's laughing at the wrong parts and has a weird sense of humor. (Nice touch guys.) Off screen Arthur gets invited to do stand up there and he didn't do good at all. In fact, he was so bad Murray Franklin made fun of him on the show. So when Arthur gets invited to go on Murray's show he practices how he's gonna come on and he also practices killing himself on the show. When he enters onstage however he doesn't enter how he practiced. When he was practicing he assumes the audience would like to hear a joke the joke being him killing himself. When the audience actually wants him to tell a joke he doesn't kill himself, instead he gives a monologue about previous events and kills Murray (Robert De Niro.) And in the end his followers are surrounding him and he feels loved and happy after all this time and you don't know what to think. I like Joaquin's subtleties in terms of his mental condition. Like he moves his leg aggressively and fast. He also has a condition were he has uncontrollable laughter and when he is laughing he adds this cough to it as if he's in pain. Back to the whole stairs idea, Arthur also has these very slow, disturbing dance scenes and when he has that confidence, as I mentioned before, he's going all over the place and doing crazy dance moves. And the best part about all this symbolism is you can take whatever you want out of it. Personally I think this is how far someone will go just to be loved. It's a comment on; politics, political corruption, mental health, depression, crime, neglection, and stuff like Chicago in the 1930s-50s, New York and Detroit now.Overall, Joker is a clever and well-made character study and you should definitely check it out if you can. Look forward to my reviews of Gemini Man and the first 3 Scream movies!"
4514,Cast and crew deserve all the awards. Nice to go and see a movie and be treated like a cinema loving adult.Also nice to see an origin story from the villains point of view for a change.
4515,"Watched it on Imax!
From the first minute, you start loving Arthur as he gets bullied, poor sad clown.The transformation of Arthur Fleck into the Joker is slow and powerful, with sentences that always reminds you of his humanity, from a difficult childhood to and awkward adulthood, laughing his way, invisible and tormented.Soon the man becomes the Joker, embracing what the world has decided to make out of him, to finally act and feel his existence, being part of this world.The whole movie is a dance, like the two poetic scenes, the dance as clown for the children, and later as a Joker for the world!There is much more in the movie.Watch!"
4516,"His eyes really showed how deep the scar he has. I don't really enjoy the story thought, but i get to learn something from this movie"
4517,"Brilliantly directed by Tom Phillips which really brings out the emotional point of someone having a bad day to push you over the edge of madness.
A true 80s and 90s film experience which is not really groundbreaking like the 90s movies but they don't make movies like this anymore.
Truly amazing performance by Joaquin phoenix and also the 2nd best joker according to me."
4518,"Why? I know that's the real question here: Why give Joker only five stars when the majority have rated Joker an 8? Well, I'll write why. As a huge Joker fan, I was quite blown away by this movie but that's because I did not know what I was expecting to see. Many fans were irked to hear that someone would dare suggest an origin story for The Joker. The Joker himself has always preferred his existence to be multiple choice. However, Jack Napier did have an origin story and he became The Joker.So what's my problem with this movie specifically? The acting, don't get me wrong, is impressive and mesmerizing and Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar for his stellar performance. Knowing The Oscars though, I doubt he will win one. Heath Ledger had to die in order for him to receive his and fans still argue that Heath Ledger IS The Joker. Me, I agree to a certain extent. Heath's portrayal was of a more laid back Joker in my opinion. But to me, The Joker has always been a man who is well-dressed and just loves to laugh. Arthur Fleck, however is not well-dressed and the only reason he laughs is because he has a condition that forces him to burst out giggles at some of the most inopportune moments. It's a medical condition he has and he even carries a card to explain why he's laughing. And, yes, it's a real condition: pseudobulbar affect is what it is called. Of course, that means that the uncontrollable laughter could also be uncontrollable crying which the movie doesn't explore, but at least the film did some research.But besides the film's research on Arthur's condition. it might have been nice if the research had gone further in depth. I'm not arguing that I wanted Batman to grace the screen. However, that would have been nice. Maybe not sparkly Edward, but still nice. What we did get however was a very elaborate story of how Arthur Fleck could have become The Joker. But to me, Arthur was never going to be The Joker but he may have been the inspiration for the real Clown Prince of Crime. Why do I write this? I write this because Arthur Fleck is too weak to grace the famous purple suit The Joker is notorious of wearing.I know the cast and crew are quite satisfied with the film they made and good on them, but this movie was A) too dark and B) did not portray The Joker in a positive light. It was as if we fueled Walter White the idea of Heisenberg and he just collapsed from sudden shock.Bad reference? Well, let's end with this then: I did not want The Joker to be seen in a positive light nor a negative light. I wanted to feel sorry for him and understand WHY he did what he did to become who he is now known as. What I got from Arthur was that he was a tragic hero from start to finish and he may have been inside Arkham Asylum the whole time.With Writes,-Andy Ruffett"
4519,It's worthy to spend 2h:03 min from your life to watch this outstanding movie .. JOKER thank you man !! 😍😍😍
4520,"Spoiler
The movie is depressing through out where the Joker never seems to revel in the chaos. The Batman scenes didn't need to be there intriguing but it gives a false image of the man who was beloved by everyone in the city except the elites Thomas Wayne. The dancing and the laughter is great but his voice is too childish a far cry from Matt Hamil in the animated series. The Joker got a huge following for no reason shooting 3 wall street guys in a crime infested gotham. He wasn't charismatic or charming yet chaos broke out on the streets because he shot a tv show host???? I personally don't need to sympathise with the Joker whether he was forced or driven to madness i wanted to see it and after a full transformation i wanted him to go to Arkham assylum plot an escape and possible turn a pshycologist into Harley Quinn. I wanted an intellgent evil madman but recived a pitiful mentally unstable sad clown. The Joker recieves a 7 because the acting was brilliant the akwardness was real and certain qoutes won't be forgotten like. ""For my whole life i never really knew if i existed"","
4521,"Joker is not the comic book movie to flip the genre on it's head; purely because, besides the name and aesthetics of The Joker, Joker is not at all about the renowned DC Villain. Whilst it's merits are plentiful, it also has many downfalls. I found myself bored half way through and it only picks up about half an hour before the end. If you're a fan of Scorsese then you'll love this homage to Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, but if you're a Joker diehard then you may find yourself disappointed. Nevertheless, by the end I found myself somewhat satisfied and definitely entertained by that incredible final act so watch it if you want but I would advise against going if you're emotionally fragile or venerable; it gets dark."
4522,"""Joker"" has managed to stir up a whirlwind of controversy, centring partly around the level of violence included but also on the use of ""that song"" on the soundtrack. But putting aside that flurry of commentary, what of the film itself?Man, this is a dark film! It's as much of an anti-superhero film as this year's ""Brightburn"". The Batman legacy has addressed the mental state of the protagonists before (both that of the hero and the villains). Here we have a real study of how a mentally unstable no-hoper can be pushed over the edge by bigotry, carelessness and government cut-backs.Indeed, there is something alarmingly prescient about the movie's plot line, watching this as we (in the UK) are in the month of possible (or as Boris Johnson would say, definite) Brexit madness!After reviewing ""Judy"" I wouldn't be the least surprised if I'd just seen the Best Actress award bagged (by Renée Zellweger). Now, with ""Joker"", surely Joachim Phoenix might bag his first (and well overdue in my book) Oscar. Although nominated before (for ""Gladiator"", ""Walk the Line"" and ""The Master"") he's never won. Here Phoenix's physical transformation into Arthur Fleck is SIMPLY EXTRAORDINARY. And the way he captures the (medically) induced fits of helpless laughter, ending in a sort of choking fit, is brilliant and replicated to a 'T' on multiple occasions.I loved ""You Were Never Really Here"", primarily due to Phoenix's pitch-perfect performance. And ""Joker"" reminded me very much of Lynne Ramsey's film: a disturbed loner, looking after his elderly mother; with violence meted out to wrong-doers. Joe is almost the yin to Arthur Fleck's yang: Joe is an invisible man who is very much present; Arthur is a very visible man who thinks he is invisible. There's even comment by Fleck towards the end of the film that sometimes he thinks he's 'not really there at all'! (A deliberate 'in' joke in reference to that film?)After some pretty poor ""pension grabs"" in recent years, culminating in the appalling career- nadir of ""Dirty Grandpa"" in 2016, Robert De Niro comes good with a fine performance as the idolised but thoughtless and cruel talk-show host Murray Franklin. It's very much a supporting role, but delivered with great aplomb.Also great again is ""Deadpool 2""'s Zazie Beetz (a great trivia answer for an actor with three 'z's' in the name). This angle of the story is deviously clever, and Zazie handles the various twists and turns brilliantly.Movie violence needs to be taken in context to both the film's story and to the movie's certificate. For those expecting a light and fluffy ""Avengers"" style of movie, they might be shocked by what they see. True that the film definitely pushes the boundaries of what I think is acceptable in a UK15-certificate film. ... I suspect there were HEATED discussions at the BBFC after this screening! The violence though seems comparable to some other 15's I've seen: a DIY-store drill scene in ""The Equalizer"" comes to mind.A particularly brutal scene is reminiscent of a climactic scene in ""Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood"", such that Quentin Tarantino might have just cause to appeal his 'UK18' certificate.You might argue about the level of violence that SHOULD be shown in a 15 certificate film. But I think the violence portrayed - given this is in the known context an origin story for a psychopathic killer - is appropriate. I personally found the Heath Ledger's Joker's ""pencil trick"" scene in ""The Dark Knight"" more disturbing, given it was a 12 certificate.I have less sympathy for the inclusion of ""Rock and Roll Part 2"" on the soundtrack. Where ""Hangover"" director Todd Phillips does recover some of this respect is in the quality of the script (co-written with Scott Silver) and the direction. It's misdirection without mis-direction! Some of the twists in the plot (no spoilers here!) I did not see coming, and certain aspects of the story (again no spoilers!) are left brilliantly (and chillingly) vague.Sure, it borrows heavily in story-line and mood from Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"". And I was also reminded of 1993's Joel Schumacher flick ""Falling Down"" where Michael Douglas is an ordinary man pushed to the edge and beyond by a series of life's trials. But if you want to criticise a film for ""not being 100% original"" then let's start at the top of the 2019 IMDB listings and keep going! I've also seen comment from some that criticises the somewhat clunky overlay of the Batman back-story into the script. I also understand that view but I didn't personally share it.Elsewhere I would not be surprised if the movie gets garlanded with technical Oscar nominations aplenty come January. The cinematography, by Phillips-regular Lawrence Sher, is exquisite in setting the grimy 70's tone. (I loved the retro Warner Brothers logo too). And both video and sound editing is top-notch. Not forgetting a sonorous cello-heavy soundtrack that perfectly suits the mood. Want to put a bet on which film might top the ""number of Oscar nominations"" list? This might not be a bad choice.Final thoughts: Dark and brooding, with a slow-burn start, this is a proper drama that might make action superhero fans fidgety. But I simply loved it, and would love to carve out the time to give it a re-watch. The Phoenix performance is extraordinary. Will this make my Top 10 of the year? Fingers to head, and pull the trigger.... it's a no-brainer."
4523,"Was a beautiful experience. Feeling disturbed and personally attacked in a different way, how literally every scene is a piece of art, how Gotham city is related to Cairo somehow, and how actually cruel the world we live in is. Heath Ledger is so proud that I could almost see him in the last scenes. Totally deserves the hustle and never overrated."
4524,"This movie will ruin your childhood. Almost (wink)
Poke your Moral, Bend your Truth.

4525,"I saw Joker last night at the Studio Movie Grill in Marietta, GA. There were two police officers on hand, but it was a very calm and peaceful evening. The theater was completely full and there were a lot of people who clapped and even cried during the movie. However, not once did I ever fear for my safety or my life. Never once did I feel or sense there was going to be anarchy, chaos, or a riot after the movie. IT WAS JUST A MOVIE. Just like any other action movie with guns, violence, and killing in it (F&F, John Wick, etc., etc.). All in all, I thought 2019's Joker was a great movie. It was a very human movie. It show's a man who's been broken down, beaten, lied to, and mistreated his whole life. A man who feels isolated, alone, unwanted, and unloved in a system and society completely against him. Because of the way the film is portrayed and because of the incredible talent of Joaquin Phoenix, you can empathize and sympathize with his character. You feel sorry for him and all of the incredibly unjust bs he goes through. You may even find yourself wishing you could help him. Because of that, you can understand his descent into madness and the reason behind all of his characters' actions (not that they were wholly just or correct by any means). It gave depth and insight into the Joker's and Batman's (Bruce Wayne's) relationship and their history as a prequel movie. The ONLY things I can think of why certain groups of people might be against this movie are: 1) They don't like DC Comics or Batman. 2) They don't like Joaquin Phoenix as an actor. 3) They're afraid that the movie will empower self-righteous people who are fed-up with a corrupt government into taking action and causing Anarchy (like in the movie). 4) They think that grown adults don't have any common sense and/or general reasoning skills, can't distinguish between reality and fiction, and cannot control their own thoughts and actions."
4526,"Joaquin Phoenix + no CGI + superb character development = A Masterpiece...
This movie is too good! Cinematic greatness!Yes, Heath Ledger did an amazing job with his portrayal of The Joker...
Phoenix completely re-invented the character in such a realistic manner...
Method acting, that's easily on par with many of the greatest actors in history!
Wow!!"
4527,"Joaquin Phoenix is the true joker
Iam in love with this .. the only movie that could control my feelings .. i was so happy when ke kills and so angry whith those who beat him .. this movie is an incredible movie indeed"
4528,"This movie deserves the wolrd! I cannot even express how much i enjoyed watching it! I am so ready to give it a second go and watch it again, in order to analyze all the details that I've missed! This movie sheds light upon mental illness, especially how childhood abuse influences your adult life and how society can actually turn you into a monster. It shows the involution of Arthur and how his tragic life develops and transforms into a comedy, driving him into complete madness. The movie shows the differences between the poor and the rich and shows the struggles of the real world. This movie is real, it is a psychological action drama that shows us how raw humanity is and what the consequences of untreated mental illness can lead to. This does not at all provoke anyone to start being violent or dress up as clowns and riot the streets. This makes the viewer analyze his own life, analyze his own moral values and realize for themselves what is right, what is wrong, what is good, what is evil.
Joaquin Phoenix brought justice for the Joker, as I haven't seen such a good Joker since Heath Ledger's outstanding performance. Joaquin Phoenix, an actor that definitely deserves an Oscar, perfectly portrayed an unstable Arthur and a crazy Joker, that, in the end, were combined and became only one. His movements, facial expressions, tonality of voice, were sublime and brought mystery, darkness and truth to us all.
In the end, you won't know anymore what is real and what is not, as the enigmatic ending plays with your mind and leaves you with numerous unanswered questions."
4529,"11 years ago I watched The Dark Knight and enthralled by the fact that how a person can act as so naive.. How a person does not suffer any qualms of conscience for the horrible things he has done... How a person sees the cruel and brutal things as a joke... 11 years later I got the answer... Absolute ingenious direction and screenplay... Scorcseseian touches makes it more cinematic... 80's flavours and retro vibes takes us right into the dark alleys of Gotham and the 70's depression... This movie proves that the personality/origin of a character is greatly affected by childhood abuse. Todd Phillips has done quite a nice depiction of it. The highly unsettling tones and real life situation makes one really uncomfortable at times... Sometimes we see ourselves in the big shoes of the clown prince of Crime. The great toxicity, graphic novel easter eggs, really dark background, brutal violence makes it an R-rated without showing any sexually explicit materials.
Last but not the least is the character acting of Joaquin Phoenix. The 4 sets of laughs consisting of Pretentious Laugh , Sarcastic Laugh , Happy laughs and the most unnerving laughs from emotional outbursts originated from his mother's abuse in the childhood gives him a complex personality and adds new depths. Oscar-worthy portrayal by Joaquin Phoenix.... Kudos!!!"
4530,"Since the official announcement of The Joker 2019, starring Joaquin Phoenix, Hollywood critics led a fierce campaign against the film, before it appeared in public, and before they watched the show. The reasons for this initial refusal were based on some of the scenes shown in the film's official announcements.
The principle of the campaign was that the film presented the idea of violence through a character who had a historical presence in the world of comics, the Joker, around which more than five films have been made since they came out in the pages of comic books. The campaign not only stopped with critics, but also extended to politicians who warned about the film and its negative impact on viewers, even the U.S. military leadership issued a directive to its members, noting that there were threats of possible shootings or mass interceptions after the film.
American power was filled with fear, but on the other hand, this authoritarian fear, offset by psychological comfort in the popular street in other parts of the world, was a strong public yearning for a rebellious figure against the authorities.
After watching the film, I was very pleased, not only for Phoenix's brilliant and fun performance, but also because I understood why politicians and critics who worked under the loyalty of political authorities, feared such a film.
Cinema watchers in general and DC fans, who invented the Joker character, know exactly the history of this character cinematically without knowing the reality from which it was created, In other words, the Joker always practiced anarchist behaviour without a date to explain to us what he was doing, for example, with The Joker, Jack Nicholson, we know the reasons for sabotage and destruction, it's personal revenge after he is chemically mutilated, but we still don't know his history, and with Heath Ledger, we were with a troubled personality with a deep philosophy about life, indifferent to his death, and also not knowing what made him like that, but with Joaquin Phoenix, he gave us a profound explanation of the reasons for the creation of this character, The Joker is a natural human being with an ambition to make people happy, but poverty, homelessness, ignorance, corruption and The triviality of political discourse, led him to become the Joker who will rebel against all the false laws of the civilized world.
In the old version of the Joker, evil was the goal, and the character made it and moved it, but with Joaquin Phoenix, the Joker was part of a social system that rejected political and economic law. A sense of helplessness and frustration, he and others have generated a certain amount of rejection that will turn him into a joker who fights power in his own way.
The dialogues and symbols used in the film, illustrate the laws that affect the capitalist society at its core, such as the closure of health insurance institutions, the harsh working conditions that lead a person to starve, acceptance of the harshest actions in order to continue life, ridicule of the individual dream, and social bullying of by the media, and those with influence and prestige over marginal human beings.
In the latest version of The Joker, it is what made politicians, critics, and even the military leadership, to campaign to distort the film before it was shown, the fear of a similar situation like the one that happened earlier with a film in V for Vendetta, best known for its ""Ideas Don't Die"", and Continued to this day. but the biggest problem for the authority was not the composition of the character persecuted by the higher society, but in describe it as originally not evil, and what the situation of rejection and rebellion to the formula of the absolute right of man to be at a better standard of life.
In the old Joker, evil prevailed, and no authority objected to it, although visual violence was higher than the last version. Joker Phoenix is not evil, nor is there violence compared to any American commercial film of horror or violence in which murder is the basis of the show, such as John Wick ""Keanu Reeves"", who dies in one film about 400 people, Political and military power and critics do not object to such violence, because it does not carry any rebel message, it is murder for entertainment, systematic violence without affecting the form of higher society, but Joker Phoenix threatens the depth of political structure and mechanisms of its triviality and contempt for the weak human being.
This film is simply a real stain on the meaning of the authorities and economic powers, a profound analysis of the industrial community, marginal individuals, and the patients who live in it. A film that tells everyone that evil is nothing but a natural reaction to political practices that despise man, it is an explicit call to destroy false civilization and to overthrow every power that bully's the marginal human being."
4531,"It's the pictorial representation of how a society makes a serial killer out of a mentally ill person. It shows how some people look at the disabled. Not all of it is exact and after all it's a movie... About the people talking about it affecting mindsets of the audience and leaving a negative impact, it all depends on the interpretation of the viewer. It is really violent and bold. But I never ever think that it will affect people in a bad way. So we should really enjoy it as a film, there have been films that are more violent and they should've not even released...
About the crew, Phoenix is wonderful, scary and really really unpredictable. Todd Phillips has done a great job. Great supporting cast."
4532,"I have watched this movie 4 times so far at the theatres. The importance of the message in this film when it comes to mental illness, neglect, and abuse of those who just want happiness and equal-treatment is absolutely paramount and incredibly true to every day life in this struggling world. The performances (all of them, but especially Joaquin's) are perfect all the way through...but the scene that takes place on the Murray late show is the single best scene in cinema history, in my opinion.Rating: Perfection/10"
4533,"This film deserves every award available. Joaquin for best actor because he is absolutely brilliant. People throw that around, I know, but he really is. The writing/directing/cinematography/music all of it. It's never slow, nothing is ""filler"", everything has purpose, and it cooks along, building and building. I walked out of the theater and wanted to go right back in and watch it again.
Joker is in a class of it's own even outside of the superhero genre. This film would completely stand on it's own with the story it tells (change a couple of names). As a part of the Batman legacy it adds a richness and depth to the overall story of Batman, even though specific to this character. It will fit seamlessly for someone who purchases this for their collection.No, it is not a movie for young children. Neither was The Godfather. Some stories are not meant for children, that doesn't mean adults shouldn't see a grown-up explanation with Joker that you actually have to think about. Heaven forbid we have a movie that makes us think about anything. Kids will see enough of Joker in Batman movies.It's not a shallow 'waste a couple hours'. This is a thinking person's cinematic triumph. There is a severity in here that the Batman story deserves, and that this character really does benefit from. This is the Joker movie that needed to be made. When I say severity it's not the violence, there are many violent movies/Tv shows. The severity is in the relationships, the character development, how do we process the things the film forces us to think about and feel. Things are not black and white.As far as violence I've seen worse on TV shows. The Walking Dead, Vikings, Game of Thrones, and more. The violence in Joker is not there without reason, it serves a purpose to the story. I can bring up videos on the internet of things that have shown up on the news. There is nothing wilder in Joker than what you see on tv without the pixels (I'm trying to leave out spoilers). Some of the media regarding this, and reaction (whomever it was that walked out) is ridiculous and overblown. It is R rated. The news should be R rated. So just consider this a documentary and get over it or don't watch.I congratulate the writers/director and Joaquin Phoenix. Anyone who worked on this project too. Bravo and thank you, really.PS
I so admire Heath Ledger's portrayal. I thought nothing would ever touch that. Well don't even try to compare is what I would say now. Heath's film has a different purpose and is in a different time in Joker's life. I don't think they can be compared but they are both powerful. They are complementary rather than competitive. Put Heath's Joker completely out of your head for this. I don't think it's even fair to compare the two now. I'm also pretty sure if Heath Ledger were still alive he would be ecstatic over Joaquin's performance."
4534,First of all its a very intense movie. You can hardly take so much in one sitting.They want you to behave normally while having a mental condition you cant. As long as you pretend to be kind in a ruthless society no one gives a damn. The moment you bring your crazy stuff outside they take you as role models.This movie has a talent of brining out the most intense scenes and yet make you laugh. It has all the elements in it. IT IS TOO MUCH TO TAKE IN ONE SITTING.Its the best movie ever!!!!
4535,"Is it a good movie?Yes, I love it! But this movie is not for all.but is it a masterpiece?I don't think it is, because it borrows some of the elements from other films and it really is noticeable.Does it provoke violence?nah, the message of the film doesn't push you to idolize/romanticize the Joker but merely understand his actions on why he did it.Does it live through its hype? I was expecting to be this kind of a movie , yeah I think it is, maybe?Does it affect this society? Umm no. The whole controversy about incel violence is funny, I think the media is overreacting. But it tackles some real world issues like mental health and that I think it is should be ponder upon.Is it disturbing? For me I wasn't disturbed but for other viewers it maybe. But I've seen more disturbing films than this.Likes and dislikes? I really like the visuals on this film, the cinematography and especially the Color Grading. I like the
pacing of this movie, the movie takes it time in developing the protagonist on becoming The Joker. Joaquin Phoenix acting capability is phenomenal, totally an Oscar worthy performance.
Some shoehorn scene that every batman movie used it kinda feels like ""they just put that scene there for fan service or whatnot"" and it doesn't work in my opinion.Thoughts? Joker is something more like an artsy film rather than a subjective film. It borrows some elements from Martin Scorsese's films like ""Taxi driver"", ""King of comedy"". Also parts from Alan Moore's ""The Killing Joke"".Is he better than heath ledger's joker?
Both gave phenomenal performance, but I kinda like joaquin's perfomance it is more realistic.Overall I enjoyed watching it. But this movie isn't your typical comic book movie, it is grounded to the core and it is much a darker side of an elseworld joker origin story. If you are going to watch this film don't expect it to be fun. Joaquin Phoenix best Actor! Wohooo!"
4536,"It is needlessly to list all the reasons this makes Such unbelievable movie. It is simply perfect in every way. It has a filing of a real movie, unseen in decades. It is real art form, not just something to kill your time, or it is just a good movie. It is beyond that. Simply monumental piece of art, that will be studied hopefully in the future. I hope we will see new era of quality cinema, but this is so good , dont think anyone will match this in next years."
4537,"Masterpiece from beginning to end. From the cinematography to the acting.. It's extremely relatable and filled with necessary lessons and messages. The exploration of mental illness forces viewers to have a deeper understanding for not only Arthur Fleck/Joker, but people in OUR society. Joaquin's performance was impeccable as always. This movie was so mesmerizing and had me on an emotional rollercoaster. I didn't want it to end! Definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Can't wait to see it again and again!"
4538,"The movie takes you on a journey to the inside door's of our society seen from the eyes of one of it's victim.
Even if you are not a fan of the joker, the movie captivates you by showing how little you think of the world you live in and how proud you are at the end when you finnnaly change the ""the world"" you thought it was your home, even if you didn't respected the rules."
4539,"8/10 - this slow-build of a drama features excellent performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Zazie Beetz, although I'm not sure I would want to see it again"
4540,"A vast, outstanding but sometimes slow character development followed by 20-25 minutes of the pure 'Joker' we know and hate to love. Villains and their backstories are not particularly exhibited at the silver screen however this private look into the backstory of Arthur Fleck and the social chaos that seamlessly brews to a boiling point just as Fleck has reached his offers a great and alternate view on how villains become just that. No super plan to take over the world, no strategy, just the fortune that anarchy needs a face, JOKER is that face. A good watch that gives you plenty to talk about in the office or the bar with your fellow movie buffs."
4541,"WOW! Where do I even begin? Not for such a long time has a film had such a profound affect on me. I can honestly say that ""Joker"" (2019) is perhaps the best film I have ever seen. The commentary on class, politics and mental health has never been more relevant than it is today. The film is an incredible character study in to the psyche and origins of one of comic books' greatest ever villains. The cinematography is absolutely stunning and the accompanying score and soundtrack absolutely perfect. I literally couldn't look away from the screen from beginning to end and Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal in the role, and every bit of his performance is Oscar worthy as we watch mental health and unfortunate circumstances propel Arthur Fleck in to the downward spiral that makes him become The Joker. The script is full of powerful moments that director Todd Phillips brings to life perfectly. This is definitely Joker's movie but it also ties in to the Batman mythology perfectly. Robert De Niro and Frances Conroy also offer a great turn in supporting roles. Is the movie as hyper-violent has critics make out. No. Is it a gritty, realistic, and uncomfortable reflection of society? Absolutely.
I can't wait to watch this again. Perfect movie. 10/10."
4542,"Honestly, I didn't even want to go see this film. I had no interest in it whatsoever. I've never been a huge fan of the leading man, I wasn't thrilled about seeing any new film since the last three I walked out on. I walked out on Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Ad Astra, and Spider-Man: Far from Home, the first two bored the heck out of me. JOKER, on the other hand, was intense.....I-N-T-E-N-S-E!!! Joaquin Phoenix played his role of a lifetime to perfection. Possibly the most impressive acting I've seen by anyone, in any film, ever! There is NO WAY that he isn't going to get the Best Leading Man award at the next Oscar show, no way."
4543,"Had been looking forward to this on release but had to wait a week so my son could come with me. Did not want him to miss a possible cinematic masterpiece, and boy was he not let down.
The camera work, script, music, settings, etc etc etc....and most of all Phoenix were breathtaking. You could not leave the screen for a second and certain parts just made the hairs on your neck rise.looeath was majestic in TDK, and in his own right, he owned the Joker crown, but Phoenix grabs it and wears it for him with passion and grace. Watching his foot slide on the floor and the arms flay that way deserves the ocsar asap.
I cant go on enough about Joker. All i know is that you NEED to see it.
Im going again....possibly a third time.
Hahahahahahahahahaha......"
4544,"Joker. What a fantastic movie definitely one of the best movies I've seen this year a Masterpiece of a performance a fantastic story and a great take on this character.The performance is incredible if Joaquin Phoenix dosent win an Oscar for his performance in this movie it will be a crime against movies he deserves it.The story is incredible and seeing this guy just get beat down by society and slowly turn mad is both shocking and compelling to watch.
The last couple of mintues of the movie is just pure Joker and one of my favourite moments in film.I love the twists and film really plays on this all being made up and all in Jokers head it's genius the way they do it.
The scene where they reveal everything that happened with is girlfriend in the film was all in his head was really well handled.Now it is a bit of a slow film in my opinion but it's all to felsh out the great story. I also like the idea of Jokers laugh being condition.The film also makes you question if what the Joker is doing is right you know it's wrong but you also feel for him and want him to have his moment just brilliantly handled.Verdict 9.9/10 what a fantastic film but slow but the story and performance is amazing and definitely one of the best films I've seen this year. And by far the best performance of the year by Joaquin Phoenix."
4545,"This is brilliant, but disturbing film-making.
Joaquin Phoenix gives an amazing performance as a man being beaten into madness, rather than heading there under his own steam. As such, the film treads a delicate line between feeling pity for Arthur Fleck (Joker), being repulsed and disturbed by him and rooting for him to succeed in his twisted ambitions.
When watching this film, pay attention to Fleck's body language. Observe how, in the comedy club, he doesn't laugh when every else does, and laughs when no-one else does. It is this subtle attention to detail which raises the level of this film.
If this wasn't a ""superhero"" based movie, it would be guaranteed awards. But coming from comic book source material, I suspect that it will be largely ignored come awards season.
Go and see this movie. It is definitely getting crazier out there!"

Release date October 4th, 2019
Audience REACTIONS at its North American PREMIERE:
😄😄😄😄😄 (5 laughs)
😱 (1 shock)
🏆 (strong Oscar potential)Joker (Todd Phillips) provides a divergent take on perhaps the world's most famous fictional villain. Incredibly adept at world building, the film portrays the spirit of the character and the society that failed him through the imagery of the dark city, Gotham. The director described the film as a ""slow burn"", and it was indeed a very slow burn. One should go into the film expecting something very different than the superhero movies we already know the Joker from. Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal provides a humanizing origin for the villain. While the viewer knows the character ultimately becomes a villain, it is easy to forget that, seeing instead a troubled man in a broken society; someone who just needed some compassion and kindness. Raising questions about the failings of our own society, it calls for introspection. Joker can first appear bland, but the more one considers it, the more deeply it is felt."
4547,"This is an epic movie with an amazing performance from Phoenix. I was able to really feel his pain and illness. If you a person who likes comicbooks, then you must watch this movie. If you have never read any comicbook in your life, you will really enjoy this movie as well."
4548,"Joker (2019)
Directed by Todd Phillips
Starring: Joaquin Phoenix, Zazie Beets, and Robert De Niro.
5/5I saw this film when it came out in theaters, feels kinda late after all these people saw it at the film festivals. I'm just gonna write this review now. This film was what I came in expecting. A gritty, gory (not that gory tbh) Martin Scorsese style movie (clearly to the likes of classics such as The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver), featuring Joaquin Phoenix as the second best on screen Joker - Heath Ledger is undefeated in my book. Joaquin definitely deserves an Oscar. The film was 2 hours, but my god, what a rollercoaster, it flew FAST! Similar to the Dark Knight trilogy, this was NOT a typical superhero/villain film. In fact it was anything but. You could look at this film and remove any Batman/Wayne/Joker details and it still feels like an intense movie focusing on a deeply depressed man. Wow. Just wow. I was speechless after watching it."
4549,"I was in need for a movie like this and I didn't even know.
The theme is so pertinent and important and to all the people who fear this movie is going to incite violence, I think it's the other way. It teaches us we need to be more empathetic and pay more attention to the person next to us and how we, as a system, fail continuously to protect people.
Everything is perfect since Phoenix's performance (Ledger must be so proud) to the superb job of Todd Phillips, where every detail is thought and well-placed.
I highly recommend you to watch the movie but, most importantly, to think about it."
4550,Story and acting was perfect. johain used all his skills to the end.
4551,"Oh my....and for years Heath Ledgers version of Joker was my favourite, up until now, I thought Joaquin Phoenix version was as equally if not just about marginally better, a very worthy Oscar winning performance, he was outstandingly brilliant from start to finish, and the story filled in a lot of early story arc for the batman movies, I hope the director Todd Phillips and Joaquin get to continue this story and bring Batman into the fold that would be epic"
4552,Is there a way to rate 1000000000000000000/10? The movie explains the backstory so well but it doesn't bore you. When I saw it in theaters I was shocked at how well Joaquin Phoenix played the role because everything seemed so real. I loved Heath Ledger but I think Joaquin Phoenix comes first because of the PERFECT fitting role!!!
4553,"This film messes with your emotions. There are scenes where you are not sure if you should laugh or feel sad (kind of how Fry from Futurama was conflicted with fear and joy when sentenced to death by snu-snu). There are moments that make you laugh (if you like dark humor like me). The comedy is similar to Joan Cornella's morbid comedic illustrations.
Joaquin Phoenix's acting makes the character believable. His unique laughter sounds a bit painful and sad. When the situation goes south, the actor does a great job of performing the fight or flight behavior. Joaquin has an interesting and kind of silly way of running that fits the clown character appropriately (because he is a clown, it makes sense to me). The character is not a simple, black and white personality, instead he is a complex multi-layered individual that makes him entertaining to observe.
The movie is realistic/grounded. Corrupt behavior is created and not born and there is tons of research to back this up. The Joker was not born with a corrupt mind. The film does a great job showing how the environment molded his corrupt behavior. Thomas Wayne's portrayal is believable because someone in his position of wealth and power would behave the way he does (although there are a few wealthy people out there that are cool).
The film has high quality violence (laugh out loud). This movie makes the violence feel shocking and serious. Other movies have too much violence that it starts to feel cheap and not a big deal (these films are still fun to watch though).
This is one of the reasons why I love video games like The Last of Us or movies like Coco because they put plenty of effort in all of the departments (story, character development, believable acting, and an effective atmosphere). It is a memorable experience, it has substance, and it made me feel like this **** matters. Movie of the year for me."
4554,"I thought this movie was true cinema; the story of a man on the brink of collapse and how he indulged in his true self really captivated me; and all of these people saying the movie condones violence aggravates me totally. The movie gives a voice to the world of mental health, and while the true character is a villain and justice serves him, the movie does well to allow sympathy from the audience to take place and see where his actions and thoughts are coming from. Philips and Phoenix should be highly praised for their artistic views on the character and the story, along with the rest of the crew for making a truly beautiful film. Hildur Guðnadóttir's soundtrack also gave a somber but beautiful addition to this film!"
4555,"First things first, I am not a phycologist. But, I like so many in the aftermath of seeing this movie found myself discussing the threads of human nature first, the sinews of the film second.Every scene, every frame of this reminded me of a Gregory Crewdson photograph, every object picked with purpose, every room structured to affect emotion. I found it spectacular, ruthless, unforgiving and painful it might not even have been a movie it might have been interpretive dance. But constantly you can't help but ponder on the very nature of being human and how far could you be pushed; how far could you fall.Personally, I don't see this as the glorification of violence as some others might. I grant you it does traverse a very thin line at points, and this is massive credit to Joaquin Phoenix' portrayal of Arthur. I think maybe the reason so many people are finding it uncomfortable is that it actually cuts to close the bone, it unwaveringly shines a spotlight on how we are capable of mob mentality and how quickly and how far, when things go wrong, we as 'decent' human beings could go.I don't see the character of Arthur as simply he thrives on the violent acts, he doesn't, he thrives on finally being excepted and finding a place to belong. This Arthur within this DC Universe is a fragile one, at a crossroads within himself. This film documents what it takes to push him to become the Joker. The backdrop of social upheaval is the fuel needed to take him that extra distance and finally be accepted for who he has become.This is also about Gotham, a fictional place, conjured in the times around post World War economic boom in America, and based on a New York style with Chicago mobster mentality, all elements that play into the fat-cat nature of Gotham, the rich get richer the poor stay poor. Sadly, an idiom that we struggle with back in the real world. The really incredible thing this film does, is we know this character, we know how it ends up, he's Batman's nemesis, he's a fictional bad-guy, yet Todd Phillips and team show us a version of this character and his story such as it is, that we didn't know possible, where we are gestured to sympathise and understand how he became a 'monster'. In real human terms.Joker is an incredible piece of cinema and I think my opinion of it is open to change as I ponder the nature of being human more."
4556,"I created an imdb account only to give this movie a 10/10 because I really disagree with the negative critics. A brilliant, dark, disturbing and moving masterpiece of a movie that makes you think and question your definitions of good and bad. Unlike the opinion of the critics, the fact that the movie uses the character of the joker to connect a comic personality to the complex development of mental illness and to hold a mirror in front of the problems of today's society is exactly what makes this movie so brilliant to me.
And then there is the outstanding and brilliant acting performance by Joaquin Phoenix. It feels like he put 200% of himself into this role and he portrays the highly complex levels of mental illness and the character development of Arthur Fleck slowly becoming the Joker in an outstanding way. Brilliant performance that truly felt like art, this is what real acting should be like. Hands down deserves to win the Oscar for this!
Go and watch the movie! Unless you want to see a Joker action flick ;-)"
4557,"Powerful. Thought provoking. Desperately sad. Wonderfully acted.... you know you've seen something special when, whilst walking back to the car, tears start streaming down your cheeks. You turn to your daughter and she's doing the same..."
4558,"Joaquin Phoenix gives one hell of a performance as Arthur. From every movement to every line, he has carefully crafted a character who evokes empathy and uncomfortableness at the same time. I came out of the movie theater in awe of his unforgettable performance. This film has put art back into a story that is typically executed through a blockbuster film. Bravo to everyone who made this possible, you should be very proud of what you've produced. It was truly amazing!"
4559,"Joker is the character sketch of Arthur Fleck, a young man aspiring to be a stand up comedian but suffering from multiple psychological and physical disorders. One of his serious shortcomings is that when he is nervous, he laughs uncontrollably, thus giving those around him the impression of ridicule and impunity. His strange mannerisms add to the complexity leading to Arthur becoming the cynosure of social ostracism and wholesome rejection, including physical excesses. He lives with his mother Penny, a debilitated woman also with mental issues. Arthur's life is one of an almost invisible and reclusive existence, something that's not acceptable to him. The social repulsion takes its final toll when the psychologist treats him with utter contempt and cuts off his medication. The situation sends him spiralling down into a psychological spin resulting in a social revolt and unbridled violent crimes that he has no remorse for.That's the birth of Joker for you which will connect with The Dark Knight and Bruce Wayne. Joker is an extremely volatile and complex character for whom your heart may cry out for sympathy in a moment and almost simultaneously look for a social rationale for his return to socially acceptable behaviour. Joaquin Phoenix has gotten under the skin of the character, yearning for sympathy, yet loathsome and abhorrent. Such maniacal is his demonstration of the nadir of his existence that the glorification of which has perhaps no comparison in modern times. Joker justifies the need of a vigilante for the return of control over Gotham, reeling from riotous behaviour of the less fortunate. The intensity of the character, physical nuances, volatility and subterfuge related histrionics of Joaquin Phoenix are in a class seldom witnessed in cinema - he pretty much is the prelude to Heath Ledger's Joker, almost seamlessly justifying the character. This rendition does deserve the standing ovation it got and is worth its weight in gold. Take a bow director Todd Phillips!"
4560,The fact that this movie represents the left and leftist media perfectly is enough for you to see this masterpiece
4561,"Is that kind of movie where your mind is challenged. Fenomanenal performance, Oscar-worthy of Joaquin Phoenix. Great work from the director and the writer and great story to tell right now."
4562,"It is a masterpiece reminiscent of Taxi Driver. Great sound, great photography. Recommend to watch it in a movie theater with a decent surround system.PS: Watch out for the large rats in the backround in night scenes."
4563,"After I left the movie theater, I was trying to ellaborate a thought about the movie and I finally realized, after a while, that I had so many thoughts about it that I couldn't even choose what to think about and that is the true power of a masterpiece movie!About Todd Phillips... Have mercy, how is it possible passing from a triology of comedy to a very psychological, terrifying, dark and twisted kind of movie? The fact that Todd Phillips embraced the project with open arms, asking for script reviews and trying to define a production model identical as we saw in King of Comedy or Taxi Driver from Martin Scorsese is gratifying! Todd Phillips is a master not just because he did what he did, but because he picked the most loved villain in comic history and he broked all the rules about following the origins story. Instead, he created an alternative character, explored his origins and placed it on a broken society that can actually be seen as the true villain of this story!.Joaquin Phoenix ( and I never get tired out saying this ) is an excellent, genius and a phenomenon actor. After minus fifty-two pound of weight, discouvering is body afterwards ( related to his movements on the movie ) and still play a character like this... It's is something we can not just say ""Eh, good job"", because good job are two killer words, what we need to say is ""You were epic, you did what you did and now... you are a legend!"" Brand new body movements, a brand new laughing is introduced, a great interpretation of the character... what can I say more? He is a legend! He introduced to us a poor man that lived with his mother in a cheap apartement, having a mental disorder that made him laugh in a very uncontrollaby way, full of pain when everything he wanted was...bring joy to the world and put on a happy face, turning Arthur Fleck into a very psychological, terrifying and dark man, known as...Joker!Congrats to everybody that made this film possible!"
4564,As the title said it was good.It was written and directed in a Martin scorcese manner.Its like they wrote the movie than added the joker in it.Movie was never predictable I thought he was going to kill himself on the show and I never thought his relationship with his neighbor wasn't real.On the other hand I see reviews saying how relatable this movie is.No it's not you edgelord.
4565,The story of joker everyone wanted beautifully written the chain of events leading to rise of the joker a must watch
4566,"I'm not a Batman or any other superhero movie fan. I went to this movie solely to see Joaquim Phoenix's performance. Holy cow! It was spectacular! I also really enjoyed the camera work and the soundtrack choices and timing. All in all, I thought it was great moviemaking. And be warned, the last portion of the movie has some hardcore violence."
4567,"It's a movie full of drama and suspense which managed to keep me interested until the end. The evolution of Joaquin Phoenix is the one that really shines, being able to transmit plenty of emotion through every single act, making you ""feel"" what he feels and relate to his suffering and his condition. The filming direction was very good, the acting was great across the board while the finale was also impressive, despite the last part being somewhat predictable.The not so good parts are regarding the story which although well presented and put together, it becomes quite predictable after the first half (especially for somebody who knows this universe), thus losing some impact and suspense which it had plenty in the first part, or at least until ""Joker"" gets a bit of taste of power.Overall, it's a very good movie with noteworthy acting and a good plot (especially if you don't know anything about Joker). It can become boring at times and even obvious but the overall experience is good, but nothing extraordinary."
4568,Great origin story.... Was well worth the watch.... References or easter eggs throughout was good... And finally a film that portrays behind the joker and not just batman's villain we all now and heard the same story over again... Great stand alone film...think people expected the same thing as usual you see in dc or marvel films and follow up to what we all now... But it's not... Expands beyond that... And really need to appreciate it for psychological and emotional issues that is what becomes apparent of how and why arthur becomes the joker...
4569,"New York, during the latter half of the nineteen seventies and tipping into the nineteen eighties was financially bankrupt; an explosion of destitution, crime, immorality and insanity. This feature, within ""Joker"", has its parallels within the realm of a New York city that we see here set against an old crumbling fictitious Gotham City, ruined, too, by bankruptcy, crime, immorality and madness. This, unfortunately, is the home of one Arthur Fleck. A man that leaves very little mark on his surroundings and all those he meets. He's a man who supports both himself and his aging, dependent mother through work as a party clown; putting on a happy face. His councillor and many medications say otherwise.He's a man stoical in his ways. He's a man who travels by bus. He's a man who, still, lives with his mother. Arthur Fleck is a proletariat of a nondescript nature. Arthur Fleck is a victim. Arthur Fleck is both lonely and insane.Born of frustration, this alienated soul has befallen prey to cruel indifference from a society that leaves only a pinprick of light at the end of this very long, dark tunnel but at the same time, this very same soul, leaves an indelible speck of growing self-pity and grudge bearing resentment toward oneself and for those who reject, pour disdain and derision to those who grasp for the light. Only darkness pursues within the mind of one Arthur Fleck.The world of Arthur Fleck is perpetuated by an eerie soundtrack throughout this film set against the grating, monotone effect of Ms. Hildur Ingveldar Guðnadóttir's (b.1982) haunting violoncello as too Arthur Fleck's own lifebuoy of classic and contemporary tunes to render or pacify his state of mind. This leading composition of soundtracks' and inner signature tune conjoins beautifully with the visual production of the films landscape. Here we see, hear and feel for this poor, lost soul. It is here, in a Gotham that is unforgiving we see the final phase of this man's inner sanctum finally crumbling around him; his cognitive dissonance hits hard. Extremely hard. Reawakening as all that he sees, hears and feels.This premise, in part, though very slight, but recognisable, has a parallel to Paddy Chayefsky's (1923-1981) disillusioned, but also reawakened, character ""Howard Beale"" played by Peter Finch (1916-1977) in the 1976 film ""Network"", Arthur Fleck, too, is ""...I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore..."".This too can coincide with the films reference to Charlie Chaplin's (1889-1977) 1936 feature ""Modern Times"" by comparing Arthur Fleck to the feckless and bumbling character known as ""A Factory worker"". No matter how hard he tries, all is in vain.This context of this feature may run alongside the ""The Joker"" universe, the universe that is D.C. proper, but this portrayal runs wider here to a degree that ""The Joker"" as an individual, an arch nemesis of good and more central to the Gotham elite and to be judged by the company that he keeps is unique and separate within his individual universe. Here Arthur Fleck, now ""Joker"", is a sum of its parts, here he is more than representative. He is everyone. He is symbolic of a society that understands and empathises and experiences' his woes; they too are ""...as mad as hell...and not going to take it anymore..."".With the assistance of Messrs Phillips, Silver and Mr. Phoenix alike this character study, and social introspective, of a downward spiral into self-destructiveness is, once more, more than a sum of its parts; It is beautifully shot, the colours and texture that run across the screen, the defining musical personas, the personalities within these back alleys and mean streets, its sociological perspective more than blends atmosphere and tone it catapults the whole hypothesis into a stark and extremely bold cautionary tale of the delicate line of how culture, of how civilisation can seemingly implode but that the last joke just well may be on us all."
4570,"People always loved Joker. Everybody loves watching this character. And DC, always needed this character. In movie, or universe, or comics. Joker always attracted people's interest. Heath Ledger, Jared Leto, Jack Nicholson. Bad or not, we've always waited excitedly to watch Joker. But, why did Joker become like this? What's his story? We never learned. This movie was a need. (Not talking about comics, just the movies).The reason people like this movie so much is that they learn the detailed story of the character they have been watching on the big screen for years. This is about right time.DC always wanted to include Joker in the game. Dark Knight, DCEU, every Batman story. DCEU's poor course led them to different paths. They need money, new universe, new path. This is not just a movie, a beginning of a kind of DC. This movie can create a new universe for DC. This is about right character.Joker needs right actor. For me, Leto was the wrong choice. I never tought about there will be better Joker. Phoenix suprised me. Acting really good, and congrats to Todd Philips. Everybody needed this movie man. You did it great.Anyone who doesn't like this movie says 'Why did it take so long to turn into Joker?'. It never happened. Joker always a part of him. He never knew his identity. Because he never had any. He found out that his mother adopted him. Penny denied it. When he questioned whether it was true that Thomas Wayne was his father, he discovered that he was living under a false identity when he came across hospital records. So he named himself; The Joker."
4571,How can I describe joker it's a terrific film an a warm welcome for dc fans. It depicts joker in a different light showing him as more vulnerable an less of a threat. It shines a light in mental health an how it can deteriorate dramatically without help. All in a great film with some little teaser for future films. Can't wait too see where dc go from here.
4572,"Acting was simply outstanding, Joaquin did an amazing job!!! Though the story didn't necessarily go anywhere, the performance made up for it!"
4573,"Joker is more than anything else a movie about loss, betrayal, loneliness and the strong humans need and desire to be loved and accepted. Joaquin portraits brilliantly a men who suffers from mental illness & depression as well as rejection & Isolation. Joker is not at all an action movie partly not even entertaining in the classic sense. There's no Happy End but more a reflection of our (current) society in almost every part of the world. If u are different u are out, if u think differently...out, look different ...out, etc. Perhaps it was long overdue to bring to the big screen and to a wider audience an exaggerated anti-hero who is vulnerable and lost. And aren't we all this at least occasionally?"
4574,"The SET DESIGN!!!! I am in love with the set and costumes. The script was awful, but it was a great take on Joker. Joaquin Phoenix was the PERFECT casting choice for Arthur and made me connect with Joker even more than I already did."
4575,"I really dont know what to say about this movie, it was a masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix absolutely deserves an oscar, every single scene was perfect, his laugh was CRAZY, the fact that he lost 52 pounds (23 kilograms) for this role is just unbelievable. The music tells you what Arthur is feeling inside of him, he's mad, he's angry, he's bored, he's depressed, he's sad, he wants to kill everyone, it just gives you chills, hats off to Hildur Guðnadóttir. The movie isn't just about a guy who turns into THE JOKER because of society, No, it tells you the truth of the world that we live in nowadays and the truth of our society. The movie is so dark exactly like it should be and exactly like we all wanted it to be. The script is perfect and written in a very smart way. The thing that i didnt like about the movie is that we didnt see Robert De Niro and Zazie Beetz that much, and makes sense cause the movie is about ARTHUR FLICK but i really wanted more of Robert De Niro, also the movie didnt show us the relationship and the romance side between Arthur Flick and Sophie Dumond they just talked in the elevator and he was imaging stuff in his head like he kissed her and they went out together and thats it. Makeup was amazing and accurate, really loved it. Also really loved the ending that was unexpected (when you see the trailer) but then when you watch the movie you know that he is going to kill Murray (Robert De Niro) because he had the gun with him and then we were all sitting on the edge of our seats, and we were all nervous about it and then when he shot him it was just so shocking. The movie is so deep and the ending is still unknown, at the end when Aurther was laughing and told the psychiatrist ""i just thought of something funny, ""but you wouldnt get it"" then a flashback to Bruce Wayne on the crime alley with his parents dead in the ground and I found it wierd why would Arthur find this funny? There are many questions on this movie and that's what makes it a great movie. Hats off to all the cast and crew and to Todd Philips for giving us that masterpiece."
4576,"In my humble opinion, Joker is one of the best movies of 2019 and of the decade. This psychological thriller has clearly shown the transformation Arthur Fleck has gone through. All he wanted was to get accepted into the society, but the lack of this acceptance has gradually taken its toll on him and on his transformation into the Joker, what a journey he's been through. Superb and award-winning performance by Joaquin Phoenix coupled by amazing work on directing, cinematography and soundtrack. A must see!"
4577,Joaquin Phoenix performs a brilliant role as Arthur Fleck and even better one as The Joker!
4578,"A brilliant movie and a tour de force performance by Joaquin Pheonix. A movie that tackles important issues like: mental illness, loneliness, bullying and neglection from society.We get to witness a Arthur's descent into madness, and ultimately becoming one of the greatest villians of all time.A masterpiece of a movie."
4579,A work of art depicting a psychological study of the downward spiral of the human mind into self-indulgence and self-pity maximizing the ego through omnipotent alter-ego fantasies blaming society and beloved ones of oneself's uselessness to achieve goals and dreams masquerading this fragil futility onto psychological instabity and sickness.
4580,"Check your optimism at the door, there is none here. The Joker parks itself at the corner of hopelessness and despair with no end to it in sight. Whatever seems positive will eventually be seen for a desperate illusion of reality. This is not the stereotypical and all too predictable super hero movie where there is a good guy and a bad guy who fight each other and eventually the good guy comes out on top in the end. It is not the stereotypical American film either, there is nothing optimistic about the movie nor is it realistic either, it's very pessimistic.The movie is about a working clown's tragic life who works at a bad job and is afflicted with mental issues. At the same time he has to take care of his old lobotomized fragile mother in a run down apartment. He eventually has turn of luck that leads his already depressing life into something grim and dark. The Joker descends into a violent mad man as the movie progresses. But he is just not a mad man but a popular mad man that is considered iconic to many.There is a tragic social/political world where all of this takes place. The entire atmosphere of Joker's life seems to provide this gritty merciless world where graffiti is on the walls of buildings and buses, the have nots are 'clowns,' and where there are snooty elites that perfume their noses while looking down on them. The working people end up identifying with the Joker's actions as a sign of anti-elitism. These people may view the Joker as an anti-elitist but his actions are far less refined and sophisticated, a bit nihilistic in fact. The Joker does things simply because he can, not out of vengeance.Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is stands on its' own merits. His portrayal of a disturbed Joker was believable and tragic. We see a man who is relatively unhappy turn into a far more darker character. The Joker is still within the realm of Alan Moore's Joker from the ""Killing Joke."" The Joker is nihilistic, violent, and has very little reason to do what he is doing. He is violent, simply because he can be. There is nothing more to it.Todd Phillips' directing is great. The music, the camera angles, the editing, and the necessary quiet subtleties of a movie that are often ignored were excellently done. There are hints of Scorsese films like Taxi Driver and the King of Comedy which added some flavor to the film. The only part that felt weak was the plot.I found myself at the end of the Joker asking what's the point of it all. I don't think the Joker knows neither does the viewer. His reasoning is simply because he felt like it. For me, this weakened the plot considering the Joker went through great lengths in order to unleash his madness.I didn't understand how was I supposed to feel at the end, it was just emptiness, I suppose that was the aim. Great film."
4581,"Joaquin Poenix's performance is out of this world. Great to see his interaction with Robert De Niro too.
If you're going to see one movie this year, this is it!"
4582,"In our methodical way of living, where we follow 'set norms' of living and endorse people who follow them as normal, there is no 'acceptance' of people who are different. Because different for us is 'abnormal'. Their existense is not realised. Then such people are propelled to protect themselves from the hostility of the so called 'normal'.
Joker is an intense story about a different man who has a disorder and a history of child abuse and torture. He is a victim of dejection and ignorance which makes him feel he is non existent. He is not heard by people and doesnt get the remedy to his predicament. He believes that he is born to spread joy and happiness but for all he is just a joker. He gets the recognotion and popularity after he ends up reciprocating a physical and emotional abuse through few murders. But then he ends up in a mental asylum.
Everyone is different but many of us wear a masquerade of societal masque to get accepted in the social group. We should be accepting and not judgemental about whom to accept!VERDICT: A fabulous film elaborating the deplorable behaviour of society towards a man in need of help resulting in a catastrophe.
Jaoquin Phoenix has marvellously played the role . A flawless and applaudable film."
4583,"He needs to win an Oscar for this movie. I'm watching the movie again tomorrow. The first time I watched there was so much going on that I was so overwhelmed with everything in an amazing way. I can't miss this opportunity, I have to see this movie on the big screen again and again. I wanted to see the movie when the trailer came on just because I was curious and when the movie came out at some point I stop myself from seeing it because there was so much bandwagon of people talking about the movie. I don't regret seeing this movie I will never. One of the best movies in 2019 if not the best one. Stan Loona and BTS"
4584,"This movie is a fantastic film that gives a psychological analysis of how the Joker came about. It's not accurate to compare Ledger's Joker to Pheonix's given the different time periods and plotlines. Each cringe worthy, shocking moments, and grimaces are what this movie is about and gives an in depth revelation about who the Joker is as a person and his role as an iconic villain."
4585,"When Phoenix is on top of his game, he can truly embody a character. And that is definitely the case here. The level of haunting and disturbing is off the chart. I am going to be thinking about this one for awhile."
4586,"Joker is getting plenty of attention nowadays, and with this character driven feature directed by Todd Phillips from The Hangover movies, you would not expect such a change of quality of film making to be happening.Loosely based on The Killing Joke from 1988, Arthur Fleck is a failed stand-up comedian with disturbing mental health issues, which is worsened as society trashes upon him and makes him feel like being non-existent.Living with his mother in Gotham City, he attempts to make people feel happy by bringing them joy and laughter, but class-ism, bullying, mental healthcare and the tense political uprisings outside eventually bring out his alter ego as The Joker.This slow-burn moving story can be considered as kino, as the premise is relevant to what is happening today in the world in terms of protests, inequality, abstract obstructions, violence and despair.Joaquin Phoenix brings an incredible performance with an iconic laugh that may or may not be consciously intended, as sometimes it is considered as a medical handicap, and sometimes as part of his clown act.In the climax however, it doesn't matter, as he embraces his new state of being, presenting himself towards the city through the media in a live talk show in a memorable speech and a finisher that has to be seen to be believed.Joker is a transcending beautiful wreck of filming, depicting a bleak setting with horrific outcomes, as bloody deaths will occur, but through that, as well as his delusions of fame and love, not to mention feeling betrayed, he at first ascends the stairs, and then spirals them into downfall, with full joy and madness. And the bliss is supreme.At first, he considered life to be a tragedy. But then, he realized it's all a comedy."
4587,"Such a strong and emotional movie!
Joaquin Phoenix gave a Mind-blowing Performance!
Everything was marvellous especially this combination of laughing with wet eyes was an impressive achievement!
Feelings, emotions and global messages!
It's a ""must"" for 2019 Movies..One of the best!"
4588,"Calling this a masterpiece is an understatementIn the end we are all beasts .. no matter how much we call ourselves civilised.. we always in need of feeding that beast..
Joker shows us that.... When we prey on the weakest of the society and when the weakest finally retaliates.. they just wants to watch the society burn.. because the have seen the other side of what civilised people do to them...A wise man once said, ""Strength is the only constant in the world, everything else is a delusion for the weak"". But when the delusion goes away stands a creature with a clear view and the weak retaliates...This movie clearly portrays that story through arthur fleck.. you cant relate to the man ever but his story there's some truth to that in every one of our lives..If you see someone's hurting on the inside help to get on the feet ..
All it takes is a bad day..Joaquin phoenix produced an art
Todd Philips mate you did it10/10 from me"
4589,"Oppression is the only feeling after u seeing this. What makes a devil an actual devil? --the Environment we are living in. An appearance of a malicious fragment is definitely out of the reasons of the inexcusable egoism, selfishness and hostility in the nature of human beings. Joker was not only a victim, but also a winner who lit the fuse of maleficence-the outbursts in silence in horrors. Everyone who suffers the pain is paying for their ignorance. Finally, The question will always be: What makes the Saints more saintly? The Evil, here, the Joker!"
4590,"Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time. this is far froma typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/ drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen."
4591,"This is exactly the way I pictured Joker to be. Joaquin Phoenix certainly deserves an Oscar. If you still skeptical about watching the movie, please believe the hype as it's everything you've imagined and more."
4592,I made an account on imdb just to give this movie a 10 star rating. its top class.
4593,"Much has been written about how this movie draws upon 1970s-80s genre predecessors, so I'll spare mention of the obvious ones. What I saw draws heavily on ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" (1947), right down to Phoenix's use of Danny Kaye's hand movements, except he forces them through the twisted bodily machinery of a madman.
The plot is mostly standard pathos: loss of the social safety net, uncertain parentage, social awkwardness, untreated mental illness, extreme physical bullying.
What makes it work for me is how each 'life' within Arthur's head is an unresolved dream brought on by the loss of access to 'medications': magnetic boyfriend? creepy stalker? failed entertainer? multiple murderer? overnight media sensation? dutiful son? matricidal maniac? socio-political cult sensation? It doesn't matter that any one of those fantasies is resolved, because Arthur is ultimately happy right where he was all along: in the asylum. The plot device of the 'case file' makes this clear.
How will fit Batman into this universe, where the villain isn't one and isn't a cartoon bent on corrupting or intoxicating minds, because he doesn't have to? We shall see."
4594,"The movie just touched me as it represent the actual condition of many people and the reality. This where a mentally ill man is treated without the proper care, so... the outcome was more than obvious!"
4595,"JOKER is an absolute triumph of modern-day cinema. A depressing, exciting, horrifying, morbid, sad and multilayered masterpiece featuring one of the most riveting und heart-wrenching performances by an actor you're ever going to have the pleasure (and honour!) of witnessing on the big screen. Another (and perhaps the very best!) career-defining role by Joaquin Phoenix whose unquestionable talent is only rivaled by his 100% dedication to the craft of being one of the very best in what he does. And what he does in this film could only be described as a deep dive into the depths of one troubled soul and its tense relationship with a violent and uncaring world. Like Arthur's own reality. A reality that could chew and then spit you out like a tasteless fly. It clearly suggests to us that everyone's sanity has his/her limits, so when we pass beyond them and stop pretending that everything's "" ""eventually going to be alright"", breaking the conventional artificial rules becomes the new norm. When everyone denies you love and legitimate care, you hit them back with as much hatred and anger as possible. If we are to live in a jungle, then one should start playing by its crude ancient rules. Or at least that's what the Joker wants us to think, because after all - he's telling us the story... from HIS perspective, right? But does that change the fact that his world, his dark and filthy Gotham City seems so awfully familiar???Todd Phillips' Arthur Fleck/Joker... You will like him. You will sympathize with him. You will cry for him. You will be scared of him. You will hate him. But most importantly - you will... understand him. And that may just as well be one of the most cathartic moments in your life as a moviegoer... and nevertheless as a member of a SOCIETY that unfortunately is still way too effective in creating monsters that no one can control. Monsters that we refuse to take the responsibility for and who may one day force us (in the worst case scenario) to pay the bitter price for our negligence.A DEFINITE MUST-SEE!!! This film is an event and Joaquin's performance is one for the ages. It will definitely go down in history as one worthy of being mentioned in the same sentence with the likes of Brando's Don Vito Corleone, Daniel Day-Lewis' Daniel Plainview, Jack Nicholson's McMurphy and Heath Ledger's own version of that iconic character in every single ""All-Time Greatest Character Portrayals"" list you can get your hands on. Arthur's character arc is absolutely not the only ace that this film has up its sleeve: the mesmerizing soundtrack by Hildur Guðnadóttir, the captivating visual storytelling achieved though Lawrence Sher's masterful cinematographic approach, the unexpected re-imagining of Thomas Wayne - there're so many more things to love and contemplate about after seeing that amazing masterpiece. You can be sure of it ;)12 out 10 stars :)"
4596,"Have you ever felt that movies of present era are too tasteless? Doesn't appeal to the emotion of an individual? Cannot portray a moral value without cringe? Actors involved do acting which is unrelatable? Then Joker is the movie for you.For me, the Joker is a love letter , a magnumopus art which appeals to the heart of people. It's like the director was in my mind the whole time and gave me exactly what I wanted.The acting is above oscar level. If Phoenix doesn't get an oscar for this then maybe oscars doesn't deserve him. His laugh,his pain,his helplessness is soo real I wonder how can any human act like this! I cried twice while I was in hall just because I couldn't see how selfish we humans are and how certain people have worst day of their lives just because we can't share few kind words them.The reason why it so special is because it doesn't have the same hero,heroine hero wins everything is good ending. Here the actual story is shown. There is no hero but only villains which prey on the innocent. Call me cynical but I was glad Arthur killed those people and brought chaos. I am literally tired of people thinking that there is a happy ending in real world for people who are suffering. There is no happy ending and there is no guy who cares about you.Dialogues like "" What is with you people?"", ""Why is everyone so rude?"", ""Don't call my mother that."", ""I don't want to make you feel awkward."", are soo real it makes you think that many people are living a lonely depressing life just because we can't share few kind words but would rather supress such people to impress our friends who are equally messed up.Joker is the best movie I have ever seen in all my life and I doubt if any other movie will ever surpass it.I know that it doesn't have any CGI fights, superhero,happy ending for society, beautiful heroine or comedy. But what it does have is realistic acting, acknowledging moral values without element of forcing it upon us , the reality of society rather than 'everything is allright' and THIS IS HOW A MOVIE SHOULD BE.What I am trying to say is, if you have a heart then you can't help but agree with the joker."
4597,"Watching a man, eaten up by mental disorder and other, mostly brutal daily problems, becoming the Joker really was uncomparabely well acted by everyone and especially by Mr. Joaquin Phoenix. When he dances, almost levetating down the stairs you really see that he is free as a bird. That almost had me in tears. To me, it was a wonderful and beautiful story. When it was only two days out in Germany, I already watched it two times. My new favourite film, period.
And never forget: ""That's life""."
4598,"This movie has the perfect blend of dark humor, thrill, suspense, and purity. The entire storyline was constructed so beautifully I could not find myself to be distracted at all during the movie. (Granted I received some negative criticisms from my boss that I was not responding to his emails:)Joker is a character study on Arthur Fleck, a misjudged outcast in Gotham City who struggles to find his place. Joaquin Phoenix beautifully takes on the role of Joker and portrays the character with the right amount of emotion.Joker has a lot of symbolism and might be confusing to some people. Director Todd Philips has put in a lot of dream sequences that play out in Arthur's mind and a lot of real-life sequences. This can be hard to discern sometimes. However, this enables us to see into the mind of Arthur Fleck and understand as to why he believes in some things that we may find unsettling.Hands-down, the best part of the entire movie was the Murray Franklin show scene. Joker delivers an awesome quote which goes like this: ""What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that treats him like trash? YOU GET WHAT YOU DESERVE!!!!"" He then proceeds to shoot Murray in the head, proving that the people who abuse the powers of being rich because of a distinct boundary between the poorer class and the richer class will always fail in the end.The ending scene was beautiful. When the psychiatrist asks Arthur, ""What's so funny?"". Arthur replies, ""You wouldn't get it"". We then cut to Bruce Wayne standing in the dark alley in front of his parents' dead corpses. And then we cut back to Arthur Fleck skipping down the asylum's white hallway leaving behind bloody footprints before being chased down by a security guard. This signifies that Arthur has just murdered the psychiatrist and just doesn't care about life anymore. The final joke is the mirror image that Arthur realizes is between him and Bruce Wayne. Both have now lost their parents and both have now become outcasts in society."
4599,"There have been many Joker's, Mark Hammil, Heath Ledger, Jared Leto, Jack Nicholson and many more who have all thrown their hat in the ring and tried their hand at portraying the greatest villain in comic history, many were good but none come close to Joaquin Phoenix performance of the classic villain. However, before I get too far ahead of myself I should address the fact there may be a couple spoilers in this review so be warned (I'll do my best to keep them to a minimum).First of all, going back to what I previously stated, Phoenix's portrayal of the Joker is nothing but perfection. He truly personifies a villain created by society's greatest failures and shortcomings. However, where his depiction truly shines is the stark contrast between this Joker and almost every other Joker. None have ever come close to this level of pure emotion in the character, even seemingly small things like his physical appearance; the rugged hair, the protruding spine, the inhumanly white skin, all this adds to the effect of pure psychological terror.Slightly straying away from Phoenix, I'd like to focus on the character of Joker in this movie (To reiterate-possible spoilers ahead). As I previously subjected, this Joker is extremely different to any other Joker we've seen before, mainly down to the raw emotions we see from him, of which we've never really seen the likes of. This movie delves deep into his relationship with the waynes, his mother and the rest of Gotham as a whole, he was a man trying to be normal who was utterly betrayed by society.Further continuing my point about Gotham, I'd like to commend the production team for making sure every set was as accurate to what Gotham would look like as they could make it, it really drives home how awful Gotham truly is. From the start we see how much of a wreck Gotham is and how dysfunctional of a society it is. There have been very few pieces of media that relates to this level of 'awfulness', from the top of my head, i'd probably name the Arkham games or maybe the telltale series but neither came close to showing how bad of a situation that Gotham was in, riots on the streets, litter spewed everywhere and poverty run amuck. Prime conditions for festering hatred and birthing psychopaths.There are so few flaws with this film, you could count them with a single hand. However I feel like many may be disappointed by the ending, it's a little anticlimactic but still leaves an interesting possibility to be theorised.But now I think I'll stop myself anymore said and the film would be well and truly spoiled for you, so in conclusion: Go watch this film! It deserves all the praise it gets and more and I hope this is an outlet for us to see more films where we look from the 'bad guy' perspective and delve into their inner thoughts and feelings.Keep being awesome, peace out."
4600,"""Best comic book movie to date"" If you go in expecting this movie to be another flashy, over the top feel good movie then you will be disappointed, and completely miss the point of the film altogether. He is a character from the comics, and that's where the ties end.There's been lots of comparisons/rankings between all of the Jokers that have appeared on screen, ie Ledger and Nicholson, which is a slap in the face to all actors involved. Each actor does an impeccable job with the character in their own right, but Joaquin Phoenix had the task of doing something that hadn't been fully done on screen yet: he had to become the Joker. We catch a glimpse of Jack Napier in Batman becoming Joker, but that was chemically induced, and he was greed and revenge driven. This Joker is the result of a lifetime of abuse and disappointment and neglect. I had always wondered what could have happened to him that would cause him to be so crazy. The fact that it took 40 years for him to snap and not before is incredible. This results in the completely insane and destructive Joker that we have all come to expect to see.I was expecting a blood bath from the little bit of headlines that I accidentally paid attention to, and that was not the case at all. There is violence, but it's appropriately used, and not so completely over the top that it over shadows the rest of the movie. Critics are just playing along with the over sensitive nature of the world as of late, don't pay any attention to them, or you will miss out on an amazing movie."
4601,"I actually think this film will be like other jokers films, but no. This is a master piece. It really surprise me. I dont wanna spoil anything of it, so go to the cinema and see it. Dont forget to smile"
4602,"An incredible film, and in my opinion a seminal work of our generation. For those who'd like that statement justified with a deeper review, (but no spoilers) read please on for my ramblings.Beautifully shot with allot of low light and shallow depth of field cinematography, its classic intimate film making that you can't help but love. The Oscar worthy directing of Todd Phillips is phenomenal and although his back catalogue claims some of my favourite films you'd never guess that this was from the same director of Old School and The Hangover. The style of film making contradicts the current trend for bleached and over sanitised film making born from the generation Netflix. If you've seen and adored The Kings Speech or the newest series of Top Boy this is gonna tickle your filmic fancy.The performance by Joaquin Phoenixa is as intense as you'd expect it to be from him, and for an anyone that remembers Gladiator and has seen his mockumentary 'I'm Still Here' you'll recognise the character traits and the intensity of his delivery as essentially being part of his real-world personality. The music and scene construction is spellbinding almost to the point of being shocking, and for me as someone who struggles with the willing suspension of disbelief the level of submersion is as palpable as it is wonderful, you live in this film through the Jokers eyes.I'm not going to comment on the socio-political insights as their inclusion is subjective and I don't believe its meant to be a comment on the state of the world, although there's certainly allot to read in to. What is worth a thought is the affect that cutting public services can have on the most vulnerable people in our society, particularly those who've suffered abuse or poor mental health. Unlike the opinion of some American authorities i don't think it'll inspire violence or public disorder but you will love it and you will always remember watching it in the cinema."
4603,"Pure cinematic dose , the body language say it all , different than usual joker , u can enjoy minute of the movie without any boring moment ."
4604,"Every shoot is an art, really beautiful and the scoring too, make this film more perfect. And then the performance of Phoenix is really good. Such a masterpiece"
4605,I'm fan of every Joker movie and this one is the best one. why don't they make a series based on Joker character?
4606,"The joker is not one of a kind film, but it is a remarkable one, the writers did a fantastic job creating a story behind the joker motivation, and J. Phoenix plays a brilliant role as the joker.
Since this has no spoilers, it's all I can tell."
4607,"This is a prodigious movie that, in essence, shows us how deeply troubled minds and psychopaths emerge out of families and societies that are more interested in looking to the sky, so to speak, than to the fellow that is next to them. J. Phoenix makes a wonderfull role, truly amazing and full of subtleties. An amazing job as well from Todd Phillips that will get all the Oscars. No wrong lines or scenes in this movie except perhaps the last ones that make the conection to the batman history. One doesn't need to know batman at all to fully enjoy this awsome movie that stands for itself among the glories of the american movies."
4608,Maybe check out 'You were never really here' (2017] which is another great character study of a disturbed man seeking redemption by Joaquin Phoenix.
4609,"Was expecting super heroes, but it turned out to be a sad story of a character who could have been anyone, we all have a past, but our face is the door."
4610,It's been a while since a movie left me in such awe. Breathtaking performance by Joaquin and a storyline that explains how his character actually came to be. Not to mention the vivid cinematogtaphy and music. Strip down your expectations of the previous Joker perfomances and enjoy the ride.
4611,"Actually I am writing a review about this movie to explain how its meaning is brilliant and deep. It is not just another sequel of Batman and joker conflict it's about the origin of Joker and anything like him! About how a society can create beasts and territories by unequal distribution of wealth, bad health insurance services and unresponsive behaviors towards people with certain conditions. Any one of us can be a ""joker"" because we are vulnerable and not immune . Not everyone can endure that kind of abuse and tolerate it so it's crucial to treat such problems within the society if we really need to avoid terrorism and crime. Furthermore, the concept of the movie is not original and has been discussed before in previous movies like ""taxi driver "" for instance;however, it would be unfair to ignore the extraordinary blot and the exceptional performance by Phoenix which is beyond comparison to any other performance at least this year and it would be unjust to give the Oscar of best actor to anyone else. The music played a tremendous role in delivering the message of the movie as well. Finally, good job for the director who managed all these elements together to bring to us such a cinematic masterpiece. Worth watching by every cinema lovers."
4612,"I had concerns it had the potential to be slow and/or ultra violent, however this movie is neither. It's a masterpiece in character study filled with this beautifully ironic comedy - the kind of comedy that occurs when you are trying so hard and life just smacks you in the face in the worst of ways. It's so much more than just the ""making of a killer"", but more so the perfect storm of mental illness and a failing mental health system, combined with a series of traumatic events, father issues, failure of professional success (thusly the fear that he will always be a failure), and the trials of near daily bullying, simply as a result of being eccentric.There is violence, but I've witnessed 80/90's action movies that make this pale in comparison.You will be glued to the screen.. not a single person got up to go to the restroom or get a refill....well, this maybe an exaggeration as I was so focused on the movie that it was as if I was transported to a time when movies were legit.Please see this movie."
4613,"This is the first time I have ever taken the time to review a film on IMDB. Joker is an absolute masterpiece. I believe it will be disected and discussed for decades to come.""
Having seen joker 3 times now, I have finally concluded that it is one of the best films ever made. All aspects of the film (cinematography, score, acting, script, etc.) have excelled way more than I have ever seen in any film before.I love that I can interpret the movie entirely different than someone else. I love the attention to detail. I love the insane deep intracacies of Arthur's mind.There is so much to talk about, either within the mivie or yourself"
4614,I simply do not know how to begin reviewing this masterpiece. It is indeed a cinematic artwork. Not to speak about Phoenix' performance which was simply thrilling and magnetic. I was worried because of the hype of it but this work does justice to every expectation I ever had and even managed to exceed them. I cannot wait to watch it again.
4615,"The move of The year is perfect,phoenix is incredibile"
4616,"I dont give 10 often in here, really good film get a 9 - but when i leave the theater with my mouth open, full of feelings and and this .. you know it .. ""What just happend there"" feeling. I give a 10 readily and happily, only regretting there is no 11 in IMDB.But your Mindset must be open, expect not a hero movie. Expect the unexpected, Prepare to love the unlovable, laugh when you feel lilke crying, win with the looser, its just simply amacing."
4617,"So i am looking always on imdb when i go to the cinema. I really was hyped on this film cause it have that outstandig raiting.
And thats the Problem - i was expecting a damn good movie. So for me its not an avatar or a inception- but still a good Film, alltrough the raiting is little to high"
4618,"First... MAN is this a hard film to watch. It's just so, so brutal. And TWO HOURS...!I guess, to me, the most important thing is that it makes certain invisible things, visible. And that's the job of good storytelling in general and film in particular. I found myself reflecting on the Coens' ""Fargo"" film, and the invisible moral threads that establish the grandpa as an unwitting kingpin of a network of evil.And this film cleverly addresses ""victim"" culture (very timely!) by 1) dealing with the fact that such claims have an ""invisible"" component, then 2) burrowing in by knocking the supports out from under facile claims of victimhood.And that's all I'll say about that. Aside from a handful of really-not-that-important editing, directoral, and scenario decisions I found to be less-than-elegant, this is actually a pretty important film.Check it out."
4619,"After the movie I had that feeling I missed, the feeling of ... Oh .... I just saw that. The last time I had such a feeling was like 6 years ago... this masterpiece reminds us how great movies are. Beautiful masterpiece... 10/10 and an easy oscar for joaquin."
4620,"I loved it!!!Storyline: A backstory for The Joker has never been done on the big screen before and I can honestly say I was skeptical about it because his story would have to be complex and nearly impossible to tell especially if you don't have an actor who's capable of portraying the complexity of the character, but I was pleasantly surprised with every aspect of this film from the original storyline that gives him a different story from his initial backstory in the comics and his return story when he was reborn in the first Robin. This story incorporates all of the issues of today and today's society that have always existed but is being told during the time of the 70s/80s. It's also very modern and foretelling of a future that everyone should expect if things continue on the current path. The dismissal of mental health being a reality that is usually ignored and handled by overmedicating is a huge issue that's addressed. The crippling economy and the separation of the wealth classes and how it affects us all is also covered. Abuse of almost every form is discussed and the effects of it are clearly seen. His outcome was predictable considering the tragedy of his life.Thomas Wayne was everything I thought the real Thomas Wayne would've been. He's a hero to his young son because he didn't live long enough for Bruce to see who he really was and become corrupted morally by him, but Thomas is an entitled, privileged monster who judges the common man far too harshly and refuses to see that he's a part of the problem.Cast: Joaquin Phoenix is one of the most underrated actors and even though I've always thought that he is one of the few actors who actually becomes the character he's playing, I can also admit that I didn't think he had what it takes to not only play the role of the Joker, but also be the best version of the Joker outside of the animated version voiced by Mark Hamill.No one can play the crazy mother better than Frances Conroy.Overall I gave it a 10. It was a breath of fresh air to see something honest come out of Hollywood. DC comics are dark. All of the movies should be rated R for the most part to capture the true nature of the story of the characters. Hopefully this movie means DC movies are being reborn and retold with more authenticity and accuracy that compliments their darker nature.It's a must see."
4621,"A dark, terrifying, brilliant, deeply disturbing and unforgettable movie with gorgeous visuals. The cinematography is bold and the performance from Joaquin Phoenix is truly captivating as Joker. I feel like Joaquin should get an Oscar nomination out of this, if not the win. The psychological journey of Arthur Fleck is interesting -especially for Criminology students- as Fleck's descent into madness and self-discovery as a villain is aggressive in its unpleasantness. The ""Hangover"" director Todd Phillips won the challenge of making ""Joker"" and it works not only because it's completely different to the average comic book movie, but also because it's an impeccably acted and directed drama. nikisreviews.gr"
4622,"It's been a while since a real and good movie was released. The last 2-3 years were a succession of 'so so' movies with no depth, PC ones and of course $200 millions budget Avengers and others garbage fest(the 1st iron man and avengers were decent).
Joker is a real movie, entertaining, making you think, and of course creating a wide range of emotions: disgust, fear, empathy, angriness, joy, sadness... I doubt that Phillips voluntarily implanted all these concepts but rather try to describe a story that is real in a sense and so it is relatable.
I saw some critics and I don't get them. Do they know what movies are about ? They just take shortcut, have no clue about societal issues and how assassins and dictators rise. Most of them focus on how the movie tries to make you empathic with psychopaths; it does not and the 4th murder confirms this. It just tells us that society makes us good or bad and than humans are complex and fragile. So ignore these joker of a critic."
4623,"What a heart breaking life he has lived, from mental illness to child abuse, it shattered me. I cried for him. I also love villains and horror/gore so seeing him become Joker so fast, gave me goosebumps. Amazing film, I sure hope for a sequel!"
4624,The movie is so authentic! Wasnt the movie i expected. But the deep Look in to the caracter made this Film so phenomenal! Jaquin Phoenix have to get the Oscar for this role.
4625,"From the beginning of the movie, i felt so attached with the character. I could see, it was portraying a lot of people's lives. I would see the violent part as it is, we should address it as reality rather than some fake looking acting. The movie is already 18+. So, talking about the violence doesn't make sense.One of the best pictures of this decade which a lot of people would empathize."
4626,I've been waiting for this film since it was 1st announced and I'm happy to say that it surpasses all of my expectations. Had to watch it twice to fully process everything. Joaquin Phoenixs' performance was just incredible. I didn't think he could come close to Heath Ledgers performance. Not saying he surpasses Ledgers performance or anything. But this interpretation of the clown prince of crime is an absolute joy to watch as you get to actually see how bad of a day he had to fully lose his mind. Expertly directed by Philips....a must watch.
4627,"The title of my review sounds negative, but the stars will show otherwise.
This movie is a stand-alone film, and this joker will not be making an appearance in any other film, it's just simply an origin story. Aside from The Killing Joke, very little is said of the joker's origins in the comic world, so this movie was able to take the stand up comedian + mental breakdown (albeit, a slow one is this case) and begin to show how the joker became The Joker.
Best thing about this character? He's always been vague, so in all the renditions of the Joker they're all specific to the person portraying them. Where all The Batman's watch other Batmen and try to play as closely to that as you can, all the actors that play the Joker BECOME the Joker, making them each so unique. It really is what began the idea that the Joker isnt always the same person, but an idea and a figure that keeps inspiring new ones.
***Back to my review of the actual movie***
Don't go in expecting Nicholson or Ledger (but just be glad it isn't Leto's version), but it's beautifully done. It's not straight out of that comics because they wanted it too feel real, and it did just that. Why do you think people are becoming worried of the negative impacts it may have on some viewers? Because mental health is a real thing, and where the Joker May be an extreme consequence of that, it's still an issue that becomes more prevalent everyday. It blurs the lines on whether Joker is a hero or a villain because it's an ORIGIN story. He spends the movie trying to figure out who he is, and it's at the end that he shows it, and that portrayal is spot on. Joker spends his days reminding Batman of how similar they are, and that similarity really resonates with you in this film.
I'm just going to stop now because surely nobody will read my review all the way through after all the rabbit trailing thing I did."
4628,"Todd Phillips ...directed the 3 Hangover movies and other mainly light movies...Joker is his first 'dark' movie...and he did it masterfully.
He wasnt shy from relying on the brilliant work of Joaquin ...the OST composer...and the cinematographer (who also mainly worked on comedies)...and together they made a movie that is truly a masterpiece in the sense of focusing on the 'unit', where every thing is kept simple.
A minimalistic movie where the clutter is removed, and one is forced to reflect inward and grasp the common pains and horrors that we have as people in our relentless modern society...bringing to life a character that resembles every isolated audience member in their own life story, where the weakness every one feels in their own life has a place in the movie and helps paint a darker picture than the one already presented minimalistically on the screen... creating a horror movie highlighting our personal fears of giving in to our madness and completely failing as social units of our societies. That is why I do not consider it a psychological horror movie where the person breaks down, but rather a sociological one where the institutes of society make sure the break down occurs, and break down themseleves in return."
4629,"I went to the Joker expecting for it to be a decent movie nothing great, but truthfully it was an outstanding movie. Joaquin plays him so incredibly well it's just really a work of art. I would 10/10 recommend seeing this movie if you at all like a violent thriller."
4630,"'Joker' character needed a face and Phoenix gave a perfect one it deserved, heath must be feeling very proud. And I'm currently 1 just for heath."
4631,Outstanding movie with a haunting performance and best character development ever seen
4632,Outstanding movie with a haunting performance and best character development ever seen
4633,I absolutely love this movie I can relate with the joker so much it's crazy I don't think this movie encourages violence I think it encourages everybody to be a bit little bit nicer to everyone in this world cuz when you treat people like crap sometimes they can't take it anymore and take drastic actions but yeah love this movie I didn't think it was possible to beat Heath Ledger's Joker but Joaquin Phoenix has done that he is now my new favorite Joker such a beautiful movie
4634,"This is turning out to be a great year...first ""Once Upon A Time"" now this. Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely perfect. Perfectly playing a tortured soul that has had a rough time with life. Millennial politics aside this was just a fantastic movie. The soundtrack was spot on as well."
4635,"In the early 1980s Gotham City has deteriorated into an incendiary cesspool of crime and apathy where the rich and powerful have cast aside lower-class residents like Arthur Fleck, a party clown who's been disregarded his entire life. In spite of this he aspires to make it as a stand-up comedian, but his troubled history and mental erosion have begun to strip away what remains of his sanity. If you're looking to bring a well-known comic book character to the big screen in a way that's never been done before then look no further: this relentlessly dark and morbid story from Todd Phillips (yes, same one from The Hangover) is a psychologically twisted and unnerving character study of a frightening individual's downward spiral and just how far he'll go to make a name for himself. Intense, riveting, allegorical but equally audacious, chaotic and off-putting with a sluggish first half, how much actual enjoyment is derived from watching it is in the eye of the beholder, but there's no denying the work of Phoenix (with shades of Christian Bale) who dominates the screen with his unflinching portrait of the damaged protagonist...not for the faint of heart. **½"
4636,"I was really looking forward to Joker, mainly because Joaquin Phoenix was starring and really knows how to play a demented character. He played it better than I can adequately describe...and dare I say better than Ledger's Joker IMO. The only part of the movie that I feel didn't adequately gel with the character was the shooting of the talk show host played by DeNiro. There was almost an anit-hero sentiment for Joker and how outside forces built the monster, until the on-air shooting. I mean if he already had a following built from the Subway shootings, to me the on-air killing was incongruent with the character as I thought it was stupid. To me, any talk show host would have cut the show well before anyone was shot. That piece could have been better represented to keep with the other two hours of the movie. Anyway, I give it 9/10 stars because of the on-air shooting."
4637,"1) story: trivial and boring. The fact that it has ""joker"" inside it is to attract more Batman fans which all will stay disappointed. It could be the story of any clown in any city. And I do think there are better movies with ""crazy"" people than this2) message: the message passing ain't anything so super wow. There are people suffering every day everywhere and they are the majority. The fact that he got ""heroed"" says nothing really. Throughout history revolutions happened by believing and heroing a person who usually killed rich, got imprisoned, tortured etc.3) acting: for Oscar. An extremely difficult role, it was flawless4) directing; on spot but not perfect5) music: nah the repeatable sounds and the dark terrorizing style of old-Polanski-movies effects don't really make it, possible they will annoy the average audience6) is this a joker from the classic batman comics ? No it's not. If you are a Batman fan, there are few things here for you and I do suggest not to watch it.7) is this for the average educated person without much connection to deep meanings and art? No. Half of the audience were disappointed or without feeling the messages of the movie.I also do not understand how this is a masterpiece overall. A masterpiece of an actor yes but far from overallIn brief it worths to watch it and admire the acting, it worths also because it can give you another perspective and view of the world. But the story will bore you, the directing will bother you at some point and the effect/music will annoy you in most parts.Not for best picture Oscar, for sure for best acting"
4638,"Joker answers a question any Batman fan will inevitably ask:We have Bruce Wayne's history in Batman Begins (which was excellent) but what about his nemesis, the Joker? Here you have it, folks. And it pulls no punches in explaining how a deranged sociopathic serial killer comes to be.Joker has a few laugh out loud moments, but for the most part it's a very dark, tragic tale of odds that are almost impossible to overcome and the inevitable consequences of isolation, loneliness, abuse... The very worst our world has to offer.Joker won't rake in the big bucks at the box office. Rather, 50 years from now it will be talked about as the most culturally important film of this decade."
4639,"This film brings its own atmosphere to the viewer as you are taken on a dark but mildly hilarious journey of the famous arch nemesis of Batman. Phillips achieves this with NO CGI AT ALL! Which is a relief in comparison to the MCU films and other DC properties which have solely relied on this. Phoenix also lives up to his name of restricting a character which Leto destroyed in Suicide Squad and getting the audience to support Arthur's Fleck's descent into a life of madness, murder and violence on the streets of Gotham city. The last 20 minutes are a bit on the nose, but still satisfying to watch as the same. This movie single handidly puts the rest of the DCEU in the shade, and is well worth the watch!"
4640,"Amazing movie, actor, soundtrack and final.
The evolution of Arthur is deep and disturbing, but at the end, when he decide to rise, the movie just become so epic."
4641,"Todd Phillip's Joker, a standalone film within the DC Universe, is a tragic and haunting cinematic masterpiece. A deeply unsettling film that belongs to the bygone era of the 70's and 80's. A type of film that Hollywood has since neglected in favour of producing big blockbuster franchises.Joker is not a film that everyone will enjoy and it was not produced for that purpose. Some will be put off by the dark bleak tone and the subject matter under discussion. While others will dislike the film for being extremely unconventional, especially for a character born within a superhero universe.Joker is a complex art house film that is essentially a psychologically driven character study of Arthur Fleck (also eventually known as Joker). It provides an insight into the brutal reality of social isolation, societal fragmentation and mental illness at a time when society lacks basic elements of empathy and humanity for its inhabitants.It is inspired and influenced by late 70's and early 80's art house films like Taxi Driver, King of Comedy, Mean Streets, Network and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.In order for it to be widely accessible it has been dressed up in the garb of a mainstream Hollywood film. Yet, make no mistake, Joker is a piece of cinematic art that we have been deprived of for decades. A type of film that has been missing for a generation due to Hollywood's obsession with maintaining the status quo.Without spoiling the film, Joaquin Phoenix plays the titular character Joker, who turns in one of the most astonishing performances ever captured on film. He presents us with a portrayal of a failed stand-up comedian named Arthur Fleck in Gotham City during the early 80's, who from the very first moment he is depicted on screen is shown struggling with mental illness. Over the next 2 hours, through no fault of his own, we are provided with a brutally powerful depiction of his apparent descent into madness.The film challenges and forces its audience to face themes they will find extremely uncomfortable. As a society we have made a habit of brushing our problems under the carpet. Joker not only lifts that rug, but it pulls it right from under our feet by showing us the brutal horror of what it means to be broken by society in every way imaginable.It is a film that is essentially about our ability to deal with trauma, our need for compassion and our capacity for destruction borne from the way we are treated by society. It is a story that should resonate with us on a personal level, about our position in society and how we deal with our own fragility and vulnerabilities. This includes our need to be accepted by others around us.The beauty of art house cinema is that it can be interpreted in a number of ways. However, several commentators have attempted to weaponise the film as a piece of political propaganda by interpreting it through the prism of the far right, Brexit, the Me-Too movement and Donald Trump. Sorry to disappoint those who choose to do so, but the film is not about any of those issues. This is something the protagonist makes very clear throughout the film.Rather, it points the camera inwards and presents us with a glimpse of our own insecurities. It highlights a personal and uncomfortable truth that no matter what we choose to identify as we are solitary human beings born on a planet which does not care whether we live or die, because the show must go on.Ever since we were children we have always been taught that if we live decent lives, are good to others then good will be done to us. But as adults, despite how uncomfortable it may be for many to admit, we have come to the painful realisation that in the societies we inhabit this is untrue.For many like Arthur, living in such an immoral and depraved world has led to perverse life changing experiences being inflicted upon them in their childhood that have carried on into adulthood through the manifestation of serious mental illnesses.Some social commentators have expressed how the film mocks mental health issues. It does nothing of the sort. Rather it shines a light on the burden placed on those who suffer from these serious conditions and the indifference in which they are treated by society. Arthur sums it up perfectly in the film when he says ""the worst part about having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don't"".Despite what critics and some who want to use the film as a political tool have said about the visceral and raw violence depicted on screen, Joker is not a film about violence. Rather, it is about our need as a society to be empathetic. One act of kindness could be everything to someone suffering in isolation. The violence we see on screen is essentially a metaphorical response to the brutal feelings of isolation that exist when one is inflicted with serious mental illness. Being trapped by your own mind with no escape can lead many people suffering from mental illness to commit acts of violence on themselves, even in a non literal sense, especially in the way they perceive themselves.If anyone's take away from the film is to highlight the violence we briefly see on screen, then they have failed to understand that the film is screaming at us that violence is not the answer to our problems. In fact, more abuse and violence is inflicted upon Arthur than anyone else in the film and it is through this affliction that we begin to see the world around him for what it truly is.Ever since the film was lauded with the Golden Lion award for best film at the Venice Film Festival it has been met with controversy. Some have claimed that Joker leaves the viewer with a morally ambiguous message that will encourage incels, a trait recognised in Arthur, to commit murder.This is a predictable scaremongering media violence trope we have heard for decades about films by politicians and societal leaders to cover up their own failings that have led to the immoral and depraved society we inhabit today.Those reading this review may have been put off watching the Joker due to the subject matters under discussion, but this is why it is imperative that each and every one of us watches this film. By seeing the true depths of how our society can unintentionally or intentionally push ordinary people to the edge of insanity, maybe it will force us to reflect on our own expressions of compassion and empathy."
4642,"In short this film is absolutely incredible. Everything from the cinematography to the score is perfect. Phoenix is a revelation and is a definite Oscar contender. I saw this film 3 days ago and I am still thinking About it, never before has a film stayed with me so much. I can't wait to see it again."
4643,"Alright, so this is my first review but I felt like I had to talk about it. I'm 14 years old and went to see this with my friend. Now, I consider myself quite mature for my age in terms of movies, so I knew that this wasn't gonna be the usual comic book movie but goddamn was this a pleasant surprise. Firstly, the acting in this movie is incredible, especially Joaquin Phoenix. The cinematography is also great and the music is phenomenal. I've read some criticism around the movie surrounding the fact that it borrows stuff from Taxi Driver and King of comedy. I can't comment on king of comedy as I have not seen it yet, but I have seen Taxi Driver so I can comment on that. I can see the influence, but I don't think it borrows that much from it. The basic plot setup is the same, but the execution is so different so I wouldn't compare the two. All in all, I can't recommend this movie enough.10/10 would forget the snacks I brought with me again"
4644,"Let me start by saying that Joaquin Phoenix played this role PERFECTLY. It felt like I was watching a real person slowly descend into an abyss of heartbreaking insanity, not a fictional character. He deserves an oscar, hands down. This film is a unique work of cinematic art, but just know that it is disturbing and violent. It's rated R for a reason. This film is unique because it makes you question every little aspect and detail. What's real and what is a fantasy in the mind of Arthur Fleck? This is not an action packed DC movie full of superheroes and epic battles. It's a character film. This is how the Joker came to be. As an audience, we are watching his sanity slowly melt away right before our eyes. It's heartbreaking. This film is also incredibly realistic. Mental health is NOT a pretty little thing that some parts of the media sugar coat it to be. It is a pure struggle that nobody would want to live with and that's important to take notice of. As said before, this is a violent and disturbing film. It makes you think. Nobody in my theatre applauded when this film ended and when I left the theatre, I couldn't stop thinking about what on Earth I just watched. I'm still thinking about it. Todd Phillips did a phenomenal job as director and Joaquin Phoenix put on such a real and heartbreaking performance. The soundtrack also deserves endless recognition and praise. This film will shake you to your core."
4645,The movie is about origin of the joker character presenting how and why he is wat he is later.. Here I give great credit for jaquin phenix for his great role. But did the story evolve..? This is where the story fails..the movie fails to convince the audience that joker is bad yes because people are treating him bad.. Yes the system can corrupt many of us but to what extent.. So there is a missing link I didn't understand if more than half of the movie the joker is being fucked up by everyone ND he is very mentally sick.. But sudenlly the movie twist so fast to the opposite twisted serial killer that enjoys killing people for getting even..being a serial killer with no morals ND enjoying it has nothing to do with your past.. Hitler was originally a painter.. For me a movie like falling down for Michael Douglas was much much original.i felt very close resemble she between both movies. ND very solid than this one..heath ledger and Jack nickelson will always remain the most original jokers ever..
4646,"I really love JP. I really wanted to enjoy this movie but..
Unfortunately, with all the mass PR and fake reviews here, it's hard to get a clear image of how good this movie is.Well, it's watchable and Phoenix's acting is pretty good but def not close to his Gladiator acting level. Also, the script/story is too shallow and all over the place.Wish it was better:/"
4647,"Joaquin Phoenix finally has done his masterpiece and is by far the Oscar favorite.But that is not the whole story of the movie. It is a mirror for our current society, where people only blame the terror attacker, without looking behind the stories of them! Nobody turns mad for no reason! In the Western world it is mostly bullying, in poorer countries suppression by other nations. Nobody cares for communities anymore. That's why we sympathize with he mad joker and it is amazing, that his story has finally been told to the fullest. Who can blame him for finally get a cheer in his life even when it meant, that he had to kill his bullies?!10/10"
4648,"Well, what can I say? I'm a big fan of batman series and especially of the joker so I was looking forward to see the movie. It was pure art, by far the best movie I've ever seen. Phinix's acting was breathtaking. I hope we'll have the chance to see more masterpieces like this one from DC."
4649,"I ve just watched. im so angry to the crowd who made my expectations huge. Phoenix is good but he is not the problem. i am okay to eleminate the criminal part of the joker for this movie but where is is the mastermind part? Writtten character doesnt feel like an origin for joker..At least after dropping the meds, he should be a little different as head/intellegenge. He is Just a deppressing loser-ish clown cuz of his life who is boring . And suddenly he got lucky. Movie itself feels that way too. it s not the joker but it got lucky..."
4650,"Let's just say Joaquin Phoenix has done a remarkable job as playing the Joker, where he really does make The Joker as disturbing as he is always meant to be. We first start off seeing Arthur Fleck (The Joker) working as a clown for this company that sends people dressed up as clowns to different places in the city to entertain customers. We learn from the start that Arthur has schizophrenia he was placed on a psychiatric mental hospital temporarily in the past, where now he is out trying to fit into society on seven different medications while seeing a councillor in the meantime to try and get better to feel something positive in his life. You feel sorry for his character through his descent into madness as you learn all the hardships that he has been through, like been beaten as a child to still being taken the mick out of and beaten while being disregarded as an adult, which makes me think he wants society, but society does not want him to exist with his horrible condition. You will find yourself on an emotional journey in this film really does bring The Joker into a humane light while also being Psychotic with the reasons behind that. He also reverts to like a mind palace when he is unsure or someone is being horrible to him, which it can be either thinking that he is somewhere or with a particular person when his not or his uncontrollable laughter that calms him down as it is kind on his go to defence mechanism with his schizophrenia to try to make himself feel calmer. When we see him dancing down the stairs it gives him a humane happy side showing that he is still a human not just a mad killing monster that we always have perceived him to be, therefore he really does need help when people just ignore him and cast him off as kind of a waste of space in society. Arthur does not know how to react to everyday situations is a struggle for him, so killing someone in defence to him if they have really wronged or mocked him is fair game, even though we feel anger inside in our everyday lives that can be relatable we know how to make sense of our feelings knowing right from wrong with certain levels, which Arthur with his condition he cannot really comprehend. Even though these rich guys are horrible people and are very mean to him, which we can see Arthur has a point to the fact that if someone like them been killed people would be out for blood, compared to if someone like him had been killed they would just be passed by and ignored like street rubbish, therefore something needs to be changed. Arthur as The Joker he is trying to invoke a movement against people who think less of him and are mean to him even though the way he is going about it is the completely wrong way to go about it. We see people are being killed on the streets as a result of his killings to force change, where a peaceful campaign could have been more a lot effective in the long run instead of just madness and chaos. Overall, I would give this film a ten out of ten I defiantly recommend you watching it really does play with your mind it is a psychological thriller that can be scary to have you on the edge of your seat, therefore well done to the phenomenal acting along with the cinematography that really sets the scene for the film. Just to bear in mind that this is a stand alone film based on DC Characters, so some of the plot of how it fits in does not make sense, however that is how it is meant to be portrayed to give the shocking reality that raises awareness about these issues as they are real life people with these mental problems that they should be helped not ignored by so many people."
4651,Perfect movie ...movie of Oscar for sure.
4652,"I'm giving it a 10 to increase its overall, but I think the film is a 9!!! It's near perfect, only reason I'm deducting a point is because it should have been longer with Joaquin phoenix in the clown make up at the end."
4653,"This is a breathtaking movie to say the least. The plot, the cinematography and GOD the acting! I hate superhero movies and was reluctant to watch this movie because I thought the hype simply couldn't be real. Well, it is very much so real. This is the best movie of not only 2019 but possibly the entire decade. It is sure to leave an impact on me forever. It's beautifully daunting and you NEED to see it."
4654,"I just came out of the theater and I was shocked I really didn't expect it to be this good after all of the dispointements we felt after almost every DC movie.
But this was different it was a masterpiece and I'm not just talking about joakean phoenix s' perfect performanece of this crazy character .
I'm talking about every thing in this movie was just so amazing (sorry I was kinda of over reacting ) but believe me this movie is the only movie that i can really say is perfect (in my opinion) from the soundtrack to the cinemathography to the characters development it makes you really understand the joker s' character from the joker himself 's point of vue"
4655,"""Joker"" is one of the best movie I've seen this year. But, lets get this out the way: it's not a comic book movie. In fact this is so far removed from anything 'Batman' related that it could have been called ""Clown"", and it would have still been the success it is. Setting this movie in fictional Gotham (which is just Ney York), having it orbit the DC universe, does nothing for this movie. In fact I hope Joaquin's quiet madman never turns into any of the other Joker personas we've seen, no not even Heath Ledger's. Joaquin's Joker is a soft spoken, confused and downtrodden man, not some maniac with a grudge against society, and the movie perfectly portrays social upheaval and the affect it can have on people already walking the line between clarity and chaos.I really don't want to see this guy fight Batman. I think this version of the Joker is too based in reality, which is a good thing, and Joaquin does masterwork here, forcing you to connect with him and his struggles. The movie also has a heavy dose of ambiguity, and some nice twists that you won't see coming. Still, it's not an action movie. In fact, this is a modern day 'Taxi Driver', which is why things like gadgets and fake gun pranks would seem totally out of place.Don't let skepticism over fake reviews stop you from seeing this great movie."
4656,"Do you think that was the type of comedy that Todd Phillips makes in his all movies ? ..i mean if you think about it this is a comedy movie ..says joker .
comedy is subjective right ..all of Todd Phillips known movies was sarcastic comedy ... 3 sequels of hangover.. due date...
sarcasm is the realest darkest type of comedy ..what you do is taking your moments and make fun of it ..and that what was the movie about any way
what i have seen in joker was something i never seen before..its brilliant that line Todd said on an interview *to make a joker in the 80's you Push him into a chemical basin ..but to make a joker now you put him with a society *
its sad how we all look thees days and i think that line was the Inspiration that made him make an origin story movie.the movie talks about Arthur fleck a mentally-troubled comedian who 's disregarded and mistreated by society. He then embarks on a downward spiral of revolution and bloody crime. This path brings him face-to-face with his alter-ego: ""The Joker"".lest start with Joaquin Phoenix ...where is he ? ..seriously..has any one seen him in that movie ...all i saw was joker ..the way he walks ..the way he talks ..his Physicality..his laugh..every thing ..the man Literally carried the movie on his shoulders....just give him an Oscar already.the soundtrack was so good..Hildur Guðnadóttir made such a great work on that movie some songs you feel like it was made to Serve joker s storyThe story .. I do not know how to say this, but the film did not know how to emerge from the mantle of superheroes movies .. By the way this is not a disadvantage .. confining the film in that category made some gaps hidden..
Yes, there were minor gaps in the story , but it was not so obvious.cinematography was stunning ... every cadre was like a painting
Lawrence sher literally spoke to us in Jokers language through cadres ...at last i think of joker as a once every 20 years movie ...great movie ...go see it before you die ."
4657,"This movie was way overhyped. I knew nothing was going to happened at movie theaters, yet I was bored and went to go check this movie out since the media said not to. I'm fifty percent sure, it could have been a publicity stunt from the studios to draw more interest in a movie, which was not as violent as Sylvester Stallone's Rambo: Last Blood or the John Wick movies. I don't get white guys'' fascination with murdering psychopaths or the necessity of making a movie about a fictional white guy comic book villain who thinks it's fun to murder people. Yet, they were excited about this movie. I'll admit it was a good story, a good character analysis of the making of a serial killer, and Joaquin Phoenix committed the heck to this role (one of his best performances) and deserves Oscar recognition, but I found nothing extra about it. It represents how the media likes to paint white supremacist males as the victims or in a sympathetic light. Who cares about their victims who names get lost or forgotten in the story, let's make their white supremacist male the victim, the hero, and if the victim is the wrong color or socioeconomic status, let's paint them as the villain responsible for their own demise. Villains, fictional or real, get documentaries or myriads of movies made about them as the media loves to analyze the psyche of these characters almost as if it's a fetish.There is even one scene which stood out to me about the black female neighbor who he fantasized he had a whole relationship with in his mind, and the audience doesn't realize it wasn't real until she finds him in her apartment unexpected sitting on her sofa. She tells him he's in the wrong apartment and fearfully begs him to leave. The audience is left wondering whether he killed
her or not. I wondered if this scene was an inside joke about what happened last year when a Dallas police officer Amber Guyger killed a black man named Botham Jean in his apartment and said her reason was she was in the wrong apartment and thought it was her own apartment. She was recently sentenced to ten years in prison, but since the star witness another black man named Joshua Brown was murdered in a funny style at his apartment complex too, it's uncertain whether she will serve time. The scene which stood out the most to me was the one with the fat guy and the midget. This is also one of those rare moments in the twilight of his career do we get to see Robert Deniro actually act instead of phoning in a performance for a paycheck. He was the second best actor in this movie. I didn't get all the horrible dance scenes and tai chi scenes after he murdered someone. Yet, it made it into the trailer. But it was great movie which shows how Gotham made Joker and the Batman and why their fates will always be intertwined until one kills the other. It's a dance which will never end and that's the greatest joke of them all.So it's a good movie. Go watch it when you have the most energy. I had to drink a coke not to fall asleep and the couple next to me fell asleep and snored very loudly during the second half of the movie. Great analysis of a white supremacist male, great Joker story, great writing, wonderful cast, and great cinematography. So if you're into movies about serial killers and analysis about the minds of psychopaths, you'll enjoy. If you're not into that or Batman, then you are going to ask yourself, ""What in the world did I just watch?"""
4658,"Well, it is usually very hard to say anything after something so disturbing as this movie, but ""Joker"" was thought-provoking, intense and extremely powerful, it was something unseen for the last 10 years. Comedy, tragedy, imaginary love story, pain, violence, conflicts - it looked so real and this usually makes one movie a masterpiece. I mean, Arthur was a man having lots of conflicts and involved in different contexts with different characters. He was simultaneously the villain and the hero, most of his actions were absolutely horrible, but they actually made sense in these contexts. His final confrontation against Murray was one of the best scenes I have ever experienced - his style, his movement, the way he talked...amazing. He could never win this fight against society, but let's face it: he is the one who makes sense and not Batman. Everybody wants to be the hero, defeat the bad guy, win the girl at the end and live happily ever after, but that's not always the case and it is definitely sad.""Joker"" is the movie DC really needed - after I wasted my time with movies like ""Batman vs Superman"" and ""Justice League"" I really expected something different from them and they finally delivered a quality product. DC comics have 3 A-list characters: Batman, Superman and the Joker and people expect top movies with these guys. Aquaman, Wonder Woman and the Flash are there for the entertainment and they don't deliver high ratings or fans. Amazing choice to do this movie and great job by both Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix. They really managed to match the quality of ""Avengers: Endgame"" and also outshine ""Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood"" in the run for the Oscars. I am really looking forward to see Christian Bale and ""Ford v Ferrari"", but right now Joaquin Phoenix is a big contender for ""Best Actor in a Leading Role""."
4659,"After watching the new Todd Phillip's movie ""Joker"", I think that this is a great movie about society and its aftermath, but as a film about the iconic DC comic book antagonist, it is rather empty because this is no joker pre-history, but rather an arbitrary director's way of attracting viewers to the cinema thanks to its intriguing title. Therefore, it should be viewed as a social drama, not a comic book screening.For those who want to know how this hero came about, I suggest you read ""The Killing Joke"" or at least watch a cartoon showing the birth of Joker.P.S. I hope Joaquin Phoenix gets an Oscar."
4660,"... (Now that's a bad joke on many levels).When I first saw the trailer I did not think it looked like a big movie...not just not a Blockblusting Superhero Movie but not a big movie in any sense.So my expectations were muted going into the theatre and unfortunately I wasn't surprised. (Sometimes I can be surprised. I thought the trailer for 'Shazam' was juvenile and distinctly un-appealing but turned out suprisingly good despite the silliness...better than the overhyped Spiderman Homecoming).There are allusions of depth to this movie but it is all illusion. I cannot say I really connected with any of the characters except perhaps the Arkham asylum clerk and Rober DeNiro, and the latter only in his last scene. So if you don't connect, you don't care what they do or what happens with them. There were moments with Arthur Fleck but the movie's delusions of its own grandiosity and prodigious pomposity, particularly at the end, just distanced the characters and action further away from the viewer.The potentially exciting plots twists as regards Joker's origins were somewhat signaled but again they fell flat like a cardboard 'Going Out Of Business' sign. Also the revelation regarding his 'girlfriend' again flat as a pancake. I think even I could have found a directorial take on these two revelations that would be more exciting.Issues again with the Arthur Fleck character in the studio scene...it almost seems like a different character at times but I must have missed the character development that got him there...Unless it was the 'dancing' which for me didn't work on any level just ...boring.So I was dis-connected alot of the time from the movie... the director, star, music seemed slightly going in different directions.Also problematic is use of the two in-famous New York crimes that are so un-subtly recast & re-enacted but without any strong moral message.Also...a movie called 'Joker' should have at least a few great jokes? Actually there is one of my favourite jokes in the movie (that was from Bob Monkhouse's legendary joke book...did they steal it or was it even older?) that I heard 35 years ago about a desired career and they absolutely flatlined it...no comedic and very little dramatic impact. DeNiro had the best jokes in his last scene and I only laughed at Arthur Fleck when he laughed inappropriately in the comedic club audience.Also on a sidenote...very inappropriate use of Gary Glitter's music (It is a great track but you cannot support these type of people)A old football commentator always said the team is responsible for the performance but the manager is resonsible for the results. So average to good performances from the actors but definitely a middling result from the director."
4661,"The story is so plausible that sometimes it hurts to know that yes, that would happen and yes, that man would be in a lot of pain. That takes me to the acting. The secondary characters do exactly what they should do, they raise the main character up in the spotlight and maaaan, does Phoenix deliver. He is grotesque, yes, horrible, yes, but soo humane, you really get to see his point of view and at the end..you kinda are glad that through all this bullshit he actually gets to be happy. Some sort of happiness and that makes you see soo clear why the joker never gets killed in so many battles. You get to see the hero behind the villain.This movie couldn't be better, no movie could do this better."
4662,"This movie is a bad joke, for the first time we see the world in Joker's pont of view, you shouldn't belive in everything that is shown, just take whatever you like.
He is not a poor little and weak guy the whole movie, and the bad treatment that society provides him is not an excuse, he kills for fun, we all get that when Arthur kills... Nah, ain't gonna spoil hahahahah"
4663,"This is one of the few movies where I went in with high expectations and wasn't left dissapointment. The hype is real. The slow build up of tension, in depth character development, interesting shots and Joaquim's brilliant acting made for an amazing film. Heath ledgers joker was always going to be a hard act to follow and this movie goes toe to toe. I loved every minute of it."
4664,"As a person who has watched almost all Hollywood, Bollywood, Japanese and Iranian movies
My opinion on this film is not superficial. So you can read my opinion carefully
I go through all the previous jokes and jokes.
Well, we're with the Joker side
In a very detailed and detailed way, Arthur is trying to cope with the heartless community that thinks everyone is a threat.
A society prone to inappropriate parenting, harsh self-hatred to strangers, and a lack of intimate communication with different strata of government.
In this kind of community that we have already witnessed in different countries
The creation of the joker will be quite natural
In fact, this is what we do:
We force, maltreat, humiliate, and label others
And if they react to jail, or send them to the sanatorium,
let's move on
Arthur in the moments before killing his mother
Feeling a mixture of hatred and complete failure of personality
Here is the joker born, the joker who is all of us, the equation is like this in my view of the joker
Joker = us
Unfortunately, this is happening every moment in the world
Something that will and will be the symbol of that joker
Next thing I would like to discuss is that: 1: Joker killings are not like gang killings or terrorism
2: The joker does not shoot his head in the middle of a victim's pleas
3: The Joker does not work with several hundred people
And most importantly: The Joker has a personal feeling about his victims
Because of money?
For the sake of family?
Is it because of politicians?
He just wants to prove if I did
You deal with Arthur from the poor to the rich, as in the film, the behavior of these two groups is similar to Arthur's.
And now I'll prove
Let me briefly refer to the Batman movie
Joker (Heath Ledger) tries to make people wise
Like Batman wearing pants to prove that everyone can be a joker just a spark.
This!
Let's go back to the modern Joker Arthur!
Well I'd like to suggest you if you've encountered a Joker in your life
The real joker will not steal from you or take away your gold watch
So before you die, where in your life did you unknowingly break the personality of a person who now has a Joker!
Anyway, I'll say one thing about the Joker: I'm sorry, for all the beautiful lies that were designed to keep society standing on the knees of innocent people.
In the end, instead of concluding, I want to convey to you the message of the Joker's personality
Hope it will be useful
Joker message:
You go out of your house in the morning with great clothes and say goodbye to your neighbors.
But you would give a poor person who's going to have your bag dropped off in the subway with a stylish robbery and slander."
4665,"The Joker. Purchased those tickets expecting the return of Batman's most famous villain? Laughing whilst killing cops? Robbing banks? Burning down hospitals? Well prepare for quite a dissatisfying 120 minutes because this time, Joaquin Phoenix is not playing as the Joker we know, he's playing as someone much more than a maniac and representing something much more than lunacy.Joaquin Phoenix's superb acting and taunting yet victorious music by Hildur Gudnadottir go hand - in - hand and alas produces an almost disturbing and, at the same time, wonderful piece of art. But what enthralled me more is the film's embedded symbolism.Do try to decipher the meanings behind the film and not just merely watching it because by then, what is in our sight takes us away from what is not. How one decipher those meanings may differ, meanings are subjective, but do take notice on the common ground that we can all agree on. For the first time - or for the first time that we realise - the crazy mad clown killer represents the unfortunate, the underrepresented, the disabled, the labelled-as-unhinged...the people. Throughout the first half of the film, Joker is seen as an invalid that no one cares of. Then there is the Wayne who proclaims to be the cure for Gotham, the cure for the madness that people like him (the upper classes) have created, a satire to those who now rule, but never govern. Now watch as the clown that everyone laughs at becomes the person they have always needed, but never knew. In the end, the society's shadow rises as the symbol and the centre of a revolution, an upbringing of the left behind. For once, people realise that maybe they are no different from that clown, the clown that has had enough of the lies, ignorance, and the fake promises of the ruling classes that Wayne represents.One -- I hope -- can realise that this is no ordinary DC film, this is a story of a joke that is our society and a clown who has become weary of laughing."
4666,"I used to doubt this film gonna be so GOOD. Sorry Marvel fans,i gotta say that i actually prefer this rather than Endgame. DON'T watch this if you have mental issues."
4667,"In the name of God
As someone who's watched and watched almost every Hollywood, Bollywood, and Korean movie
I think jokes are people's mirrors
He's not a stranger, the view that Joker is a murderer is true; that he is crazy, too.
But since we are the mirror, we are at the heart of this incident.
They were us, ordinary people who needed spark (Joker)
Each of us is a killer and a joker who just needs a spark to get out"
4668,"This is an instant classic. The best movie I can remember seeing at the cinema, and I think it rightly takes its place in the top ranks of IMDb.Joaquin Phoenix offers a masterclass in performance, I have never seen anything like it.
The story is so well paced, every step along the way and each character development make perfect sense, and in the end come together to create a 100% believable anti-hero.Nowhere along the story did I doubt the realism of the story unfolding, nothing was ""a stretch"". It all fell into place intuitively, and seeing the Joker literally being created from the society he is in was a blast, and it was depressing, and it was stunning.Adding this level of realism and groundedness to a character we previously knew only in a different light really hit home for me.
It ties in perfectly into the Batman saga as well, creating a perfectly realistic bridge between the Batman stories we know and our world.Along with the stellar acting, the score, directing, cinematography, camera, costume design, EVERYTHING is on such a high level, I will not be surprised to see some Oscar nominations coming this way.Much more than simply a good 'comic movie' this was just a great film in every way.
'JOKER' is a very special picture, something that comes along only every so often, and that truly impacts you during and after viewing it.Now if you'll excuse me, I'll have to get a ticket for my second viewing. 10/10"
4669,"To start, the whole ""this movie is dangerous"",
I get why people say that but they are just really exaggerating.Second of all,
Most of you know that this movie is really inspired by Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy.
That's one of the problems I have with this movie.
Don't get me wrong. I still think it's amazing it's just that, if this movie went a little bit different than Taxi Driver's story, it could have been a bit different.
But still, it's just a minor problem.Another problem I had with it is that it went a bit faster than I expected...
Just in a few scenes...
For example, after he killed those three people that beat him he ran out of the train station and into a dark toilet.
I get why he was dancing but, it was a bit weird to see him going from killing three people immediately to that.
I kinda got out of the...experience...?
I don't know how to put it into words...
In that moment I felt...like I was watching a movie...in a theater...
But, Joaquin Phoenix did a really good job and the performance was just absolutely terrifyingly good.The thing with Thomas and Bruce Wayne was kinda...unnecessary?
But not really...it was a nice addition to the plot and I didn't really mind it (and it's also a joker movie so it makes even more sense).
But if it wasn't there I think this movie would have been almost the same.Overall...
Amazing
I give this movie a 9/10"
4670,"100/100
This film is just simply a masterpiece! If I could think of any words that are higher than a masterpiece then I would say it. Critics no longer know what a good movie is."
4671,"As for the Joaquin Phoenix better joker, i disagree. Heath Ledgers Joker was far superior, the raw edge and calculated genius of the joker acted out by brilliantly down to the way he moves and spoke. Joaquin Phoenix joker seems like an ordinary mad man which could be you or could be me, and we havent seen enough of his joker we see and attach to Arthur Fleck not the Joker. An enjoyable 2 hours as the gothom descends into chaos. The main play here is clearly mental illness which lately every man and his dog seem to have, thus making the movie relatable. The connection to the joker comes in the form of his day dreams (which we all do but will have you question if your mad to) which Arthur Fleck soon realises he is an evil. I think the link to Thomas Wayne didnt need to be there, as when we think the bigger batman world it is all a little close."
4672,"Good. yes, bit only good.
Jhoaquin espectacular, it's true."
4673,Within 15 minutes I already had tears in my eyes. My heart was with the Joker from the beginning to the very end of this movie. Never before have I been so moved by such a seemingly evil character.Joaquin's performance is nothing other than a master piece. Flawless.What this movie teaches us about mental health and the failing system we all live in is incredibly eye opening.I can't wait to see this again and again.
4674,"If you don't take this movie out of context, it is exactly what it should be. If you know the Joker and his story, this would be a perfect explanation of why he does what he does. Falling in acid just didn't make sense, this does! It's not bad to feel empathy for the guy, we all do, and that's what makes the movie so great. It makes you actually feel empathy for a lunatic, that's the whole point! And for the sad people who rate this movie poorly, they're just catching themselves feeling empathy for a killer, and they can't handle the truth. And as most people who can't handle the truth, they start blaming others, the movie in this case, instead of their own, not understanding the movie. Also, I recommend you to watch The Dark Knight, Batman (1989) and some other joker clips on YouTube before Joker, to fully understand this joker and where he came from. It's sad a lot of people just ruin this movie because they know nothing about the Batman series and the Joker."
4675,"No CGI, No crappy humor, just raw human emotions portrayed in a manner that you can't look away and you can't stare at him for long, if you do he'll get you..
In a world oversaturated of ""funny"" comic book movies, the only serious one is about a clown
Marvel created an alien warlord villain with super powers by giving him an infinity gauntlet
DC made a human villain by just throwing him into the society taking away everything he had... funny how it works..!!
Apparently the best super villain ever in this CGI dominated world is a skinny clown with no powers and being beaten by everyone.. that's dark, that's deep ..DC.. you have my attention!!
A masterpiece and Phoenix has owned the movie completely. I have no frikking right to rate one such movie!
Do you still wanna know how he got those (O)scars?"
4676,"Joaquin Phoenix puts forward one of the best acting performances of our generation. I still watch the Dark Knight to this day for Heath Ledger's incredible performance. While it is certainly unfair to compare one's rendition to the other, I never thought I would see the Joker brought to life in as dynamic of a way as Ledger's Joker, but Phoenix certainly did so.
The movie is deeply disturbing and is an emotional roller-coaster. Without revealing spoilers, the movie is about a severely mentally ill man who is becoming more and more psychotic as society pushes him away and into madness.
The ending. I can't even put it into words. All I will say is this: when Phoenix goes full ""Joker"" at the end, I had goosebumps on my arms for minutes. When you watch the movie, you will know the exact moment I'm talking about.
For me, this was one of those movies that will be talked about for years to come."
4677,"Review Joker (2019)
This is a much of feelings, this movie is incredible, raw, and necessary to the society who we live today, this movie is better than hype, photography, Phoenix, is fenomenal, and he deserve a nomination in the Oscar, I don't like so much to compare movies, but I'm sorry, this movie is the best of the year, go to the cinema, don't afraid, because ever moment in this movie is a punch in your stomach, If you like the joker character, You love this movie, because Arthur fleack is insane, crazy mind, and you have compassion for him, but in the same time you understood what he did is wrong, that's is the duality, and the movie is very influenced by movie of Scorsese, How taxi driver, king of Comedy, and doses of ultra violence, clockwork orange, or the Phoenix movies too, you never really here, it's a social critic of your society, Gotham is a dirty, corrupt, don't have health, safety, the government don't give it your own citizens, the citizens don't have job, this is a movie to think, a lot, rethink ""polemical themes"", who is the better government, people who have mental issues, deserve treatment, and stop the bullying your the fake news, don't matter, who is your political position, see the people, have empathy for them, when a society is sick, the retreat is a problem candidate, Joker so is a movie adaptation of the comics, have similarities with Dark knight, by Frank Miller comics, and the killing Joke, By Alan Moore, I think now is the best adaptation of a movie adaptation of a comic book, Phoenix honors Heath Ledger, this movie is euphoric, phenomenal, and deserve your time, go to the cinema, and watch this movie!!!
This movie is hard to digest, heavy, and don't let kids watch this movie, is a adult movie, one study of human Psyche, you imerge in the mind of joker, this movie will be a classic over de years"
4678,"This was a well written, well acted and well directed movie. Joaquim should definitely win an Oscar for this performance.He was dark....very dark
He lost a lot of weight for this movie as well.I might go back!!!"
4679,I knew this film was not your average comic film. I think it really does well delivering a political message and portraying mental illness in the film. Joaquin's performance was amazing. I believe the people in the theater with me expected this joker to be like the terrible Jared Leto one. Don't go to this movie expecting a ameature joker. This is a mature joker.
4680,"The movie had a amazing acting by joaquin phoenix, great diercting and cinematography but it took alot of things from taxi driver and the king of comedy and this was the biggest issue in the movie. The second issue that the movie focused on the physiological part of arthur flick we didn't see a real joker except at the last 15 minutes of the movie so the movie is so great and one of the best movies of 2019 but it's still not a masterpiece"
4681,With only one movie and one character DC brings a wonderful story with meaning to the fans. This is definitely the movie of the year. I support Martin Scorcese.
4682,"I still can't move on, I guess Arthur was right. Always put a happy smile on your face. But at the end of the day, that's life. Your life might be a comedy, but still it revolves negative things that might trigger you as a person, and as a human being. I got mixed reaction with the story, and how the movie end up. But still, Joaquin Phoenix is really top of my favorite actors from before up to now. Joker sets the bar. It was really dark and a deep movie. Everytime Joker laugh because of his illness mixing with his emotion that was sad, just hit me so hard. The kid scene with his mom, train scene with those three guys and the stairs where Arthur Fleck was dancing, really just phenomenal. Indeed, it has a political vibe wherein it provides hints of reality and gruesome acts. I still believe on movies that provide entertainment and this movie is definitely one of it. I'm happy and sad that I get to watch this on my Birthday. Joker is an Art and a dark reality of one's emotion."
4683,"As it has soaked in more, and I keep not being able not to think about it..I think the Joker is a masterpiece.As far as any of the negative reviews--This has happened before, and not just with movies. People hated on Moby Dick when it was first published. But decades later the consensus was that it was a masterpiece. Expectations based on Herman Mellville's previous adventure stories had a lot to do with that... And I think people who have expressed distaste for it as being excessive (and I wrestled with that while watching)--well, look at A Clockwork Orange. Taxi Driver. The Deer Hunter. All with shocking stuff. Deliverance. Scar Face.Pfft, and this movie was better than Taxi Driver and The Deer Hunter. And at least as good as the others, in my opinion. Probably ties with Clockwork, for me, but I haven't seen that since I was 17 (now 52)--but I have read the book since then twice, so that's where I'm probably making the comparison.If I don't see it in theaters again I may have to buy Joker when it is released on disc. There's so much there. And I think for a ""character study"" where we never leave arthur's side, that's quite an accomplishment. And as one reviewer wrote: this didn't even have to be in the DC universe, it's so believable, relevant, its own stand-alone story.Also, some seemed not to like it as a commentary on society, on how some evil people are formed, on the effects upon the downtrodden and dispossessed. To that I say PSHAW. The effective hammer-blow of an illustration or an allegory is sometimes needfully created by hyperbole. THIS Joker origin-story is as disturbing and as powerful as it is because of the recurring real-world stories it reflects back to us in its horror-house colors. The mass-murderers that have been among us and are still among us don't need this movie for inspiration. But the film's insights into the ramifications of wealth-driven elitism, of cruelty, and of apathy--those insights don't excuse violent rage--but I think they do legitimately spotlight some fuel sources for the fire."
4684,"I saw this film with high expectations and I was not disappointed. I was transfixed. Joker is a beautiful work of art that everyone should see and judge for themselves.
I'm convinced that the bad reviews are either politically motivated or the critics did not see the movie. There's nothing about this movie that incites incell violence or promotes alt-right nonsense.
It's just a good movie. Go see it."
4685,"JOKER ReviewThe BeginningJoker, voted as the most anticipated movie of 2019, theorised to grab all the oscars and walk away with flawless scorings of 10/10 and 100%. While the acting in this movie deserved all the anticipation and hype, that can't be said about the rest of the work on this movie. This is the first movie Todd Phillips has done that is very serious, doing titles such as the hangover trilogy which are mostly comedy. While he did a creditable job with his other films his should maybe stick to what is suitable for his style of writing.The GoodJoker is a good movie, to call it bad would be a massive disrespect to Joaquin Phoenix, Lawrence Sher (cinematography) and Todd Phillips (in his directing). Before I explain why this take on Joker was so good, I would like to just say that I will not compare Joaquin Phoenix to Heath Ledger as they are two VERY different takes and should not be compared. Well why did this take on Joker work? Joker has always been a character that has fought with ""The Good Guy"" while he takes the role of ""The Bad Guy"".This take had Joker fighting himself and society, which on paper sounds like it would be an edgy, wanna be dark movie idea. But, it really works. The idea of him fighting with both his own mental state and the people that don't understand that he is mentally ill, which is increasingly impacted by the fact that the mental health care within gotham city is shut down. The best example I can think of that shows the excellent structure of that section of the movie is the episodes with the girl.Joker (Arthur Fleck) later in the movie comes back from a train ride and walks into a lady's apartment in his building and they ""make out"". She then goes on a date with him, later goes to a comedy show with him and then sits with him while he watches his mother in hospital. Again later Joker comes home and goes into her apartment and sits on the couch. The woman comes out of her kids room and sees him. She gets freaked out and says ""hey what are you doing here, this isn't your apartment."" and joker looks confused.The camera zooms in of his face and then a flashback sequence occurs in which it shows the scenes where he was with the girl, turns out she was never there and it was his mind that placed her there with him. That part of the movie was done so well as it subverts all expectations of lovey dovey lady helps the criminal and falls in love with him. Nothing can best psychological themes when done right, it really showed the strong suit of some of the writing.Joaquin does a terrific job with his body language as whenever he wants to exaggerate something his controls his facial expression to express exactly what he wants the audience to feel, mainly using his eyes and extremely skinny torso to portray his messed mental state. Many scenes had Joker dancing without his shirt, you can see bruises and you can see his rib cage right against his skin.Now the directing and cinematography is very well done, all camera placements match the emotion that is in the scene. Colours are used to show emotion perfectly with shades of blue and grey and red used with sadness, discomfort and anger.
The BadNow due to this movie not being written by little kids i'm going to be brutally honest. The one simple rule for the most part in movies is SHOW DON'T TELL. They decided that the best way to follow that rule was to not. Bad call. 20 minutes in they do something that pisses me off so much. So, this movie was about Mental Health issues and how they aren't treated properly and it addresses a lot about mental health.The way to not do this is exactly what the movie did. 20 minutes in, Joker is writing some jokes down in a book. He writes a joke about Mental Health and they decide the best option is to zoom in and focus on the words ""mental health"" that is a clear example of telling not showing, major mistake that should have been so obvious not to do. The writing in this movie is at points very good and then it weakens down, this weakens the good as the flow is ruined.The writers (Todd Phillips and Scott Silver) have tried to put a bunch of stories together which did not work, for example there are a few too many meaningless scenes in which Joker is dancing, I understand this is supposed to be a way to show his mental state and extreme lack of weight but it takes away from the ending scene in which Joker dances on the hood of a police car in front of thousands of people wearing clown masks which would have been incredibly powerful if it did not overuse the dancing thing.The speed of the movie is very wonky, there will be intense fast action which then slows down completely to a very slow dancing scene. That isn't the best way to change the pace as it didn't make as much sense, which could be argued that its an example of his mental state but it really doesn't fit in with the other episodes he has. All in all the writing is strong in parts but doesn't hold up when the rest isn't executed well. I don't know if the two writers kept swapping the page when writing it but it seems very zig zag.The UglyThis movie was very good looking with its cinematography and didn't have any mistakes or bad camera placements. The only thing I can think of that made a certain scene ugly was (MASSIVE SPOILER IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FIRST WARNING) - A goon kills Bruce Wayne's parents and the stereotypical pearls dropping to the ground shot that was part slo mo but part normal pace and it felt very out of place.
The VerdictJoker was a good attempt at making a psychological, personal conflict, drama. There are some unforgettable scenes in this movie and to be truthful I enjoyed the movie, it's just the weak writing and overuse of slow shots that make this movie not as good as all the advertising hyped up. Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar for his performance and deserves all the credit he is getting. Joker was perfectly acted, directed and produced, but weak writing is the very structure a movie is based on.7/10Golden Revolver Award
(award for a movie that does its own style and nails it.) Do note this award is not for the writing at all, this is strictly for Joaquin's acting, The Cinematography and Todd's directing."
4686,"The movie tries to be different, more darker compared to all comics ones. I didn't see a deeper message, I didn't feel at the edge of my seat and I didn't see a WTF plot twist. It's an okay to decent and I am truly suprised by the rating making it a Masterpiece by IMDB standarts. The Joker in the movie is portrayed as really troubled person, in fact so much that its imposible someone like him to walk free in Society. I get its Fiction and some things you have to just ""accept"" but still there are limits and if you are trying to sell a serious idea, you should stick to them. Arthur is completely unlikable, crazy and scarily awkward from every possible angle and somehow he is let to entertain children in a hospital?! They try to sell the idea that Society has pushed him to become who he is but that would have worked a lot better if he was a rather 50-50 normal person with problems. That way while struggling to find his path you could sympatize with him and when cops come to his house and see him, you won't start asking the question why are they such a bad detectives when its obvious that something is not right with that fella. The ending is strange or I didn't get the idea with the love interest. I mean the girl they choose is a solid 9/10 and it was obvious that she is way out of his league and that all of it was in his head.
IMO the creators just wanted to make a complicated movie that would shock the audience but it didn't came organic ... like the Matrix for example. I just read about the director talking about the finale and he was way over with his deeper suggestions about plot holes."
4687,"(The title of the movie is ""Joker"". You know what this movie is about. This review contains very very minor spoilers, but you most likely know them already, because you read the title of the movie.)This movie is pretty worshipped at the moment, and a lot of people are saying it is a masterpiece. I am not sure if it is or not, in my opinion it is definitely not a clear yes at least - which means the same as a no at the moment.So this movie is esssentially a backstory of the Joker. (Duh) And it does this in actually quite a believable, and even ""realistic"" way.This movie is quite uncomfortable, the most uncomfortable bits come from finding out details about the main characters private life, how he is as a person. Because people like this kind of exist in real life (but things are dramatized in the movie). And the movie uses this as a way to tell, as i said earlier, a believable Joker backstory.However, sad to say, as it is a movie with some quite uncomfortable parts, those can also in a way be translated as ""boring"". I am not saying the movie is boring, it is just that those scenes are basically just designed for Joaquin pheonix to display his acting talent and how he is the character, and how the character is ""real"". And dont get me wrong, he is great. But these scenes only serves that purpose. But in a sense they are also necessary for the backstory to work, so basically the movie MUST have these of what are essentially ""boring"" parts. Which is a dilemma, i guess.The best parts of this movie are easily the parts when you see the TRUE Joker, those glimpses of the comic book villain. And Joaquin pheonix looks..... AWESOME in those scenes. But they are few...Looking forward to a sequel, or a future movie with Joaquin playing the Joker!!!"
4688,"THE BEST MOVIE EVER, NOTHING ELSE TO SAY........................"
4689,"This movie is really beyond expectations, imagination and way too far to be understood by some critics. Whoever called it masterpiece, it was low, raise the bar a little higher cause this is universal perfection. Never ever thought i'd see a Joker like this, presented as in the movie, to think, feel, be in his shoes before i thought what a madman would be. That cool guy who kills and laughs, dances, goes instant insane, was a very kind person, with problems. And doesn't end here, in the beginning i was sceptic, thought it was a scam when i first saw his laugh(some critics and i thought it was fake) but, that was wrong, there were tiny bits of parts where he changed, and it felt, victorious, bad, crazy, funny and hell, it felt Joker!
The movie gave you all the feels and moments you need and in opposition to those feels. He fired a gun, fell and turned up the volume on tv, that was the first signs of it's clumsy side and trying to repair what was done, god i was the only one who laughed my ass of in cinema. Then slowly (critics, please, just shove your phd's right up you cause this move you wouldn't get if you don't have a very high EQ and IQ), slowly as i said, that laugh started to get the shape, that perfect shape i always thought it would be. Won't spoil the whole actions in order, do it yourselves, as each dc fan would imagine it, but it was completed in the final with a spectacular oscar."
4690,"""Joker"" does not play around. This is not the typical comic book movie. Batman doesn't swing through a window, the Joker doesn't trap Batman in a funhouse. In this movie the Joker is the clear star, portrayed brilliantly disturbed by Joaquin Phoenix. Forget the critics, the media, or headlines saying that Joker is too violent. It's perfectly justified in its actions, giving the viewer a thrill ride through the character that is, ""Joker."""
4691,Phoenix does a incredible job as the joker in a realistic depiction of the character in a story that keeps you in the edge of your seat until the fantastic climax
4692,Joaquin Phoenix deserves the Oscar. Heath would definitely be proud.
4693,This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I didn't want it to end. I forgot to eat my popcorn it was so intriguing. Perfect story line. Mr. Phoenix gives one of the most amazing performances ever shot on camera. This is going to be a classic. Bravo Joaquin. Bravo.
4694,"The plot and the character development is amazing
The psychological part of the movie makes it different it touches depression instead of happiness(comedy), fear(horror/thriller) or adrenaline rush (action)....it touches different kind of emotions however as long as it elicit emotions that enough makes it a great movie, however however i hope that the main character was someone more fit for the role."
4695,"This movie has a very great performance by joaquin phoenix he did a different and special edition of joker character he had avery special laugh, too. He had a very loudly laugh but he had weak and hurting in himself this was remarkable it makes you fell the pain that he is feeling and he had a great transformation from the the normal physiological patient to high level of physiological problems that make him the joker and made him kill three people, kill his mother and robert de niro character and the movie had a great cinematography and directing, too and the movie had very good plot twists that blowing your mind like that the joker is a half brother to bruce wayne the movie took this plot twist and made a plot twist from a plot twist that the joker's mother is a physiological patient, too and she was lieing about the half brother then we have the great plot twist that all of the movie is just from the imagination of Arthur flick but the movie had a lot of things from Martin scorsese's movies like taxi driver and the king of comedy and that was the biggest issue in the movie. The movie also focused on the physiological part of arthur flick and not the joker we didn't see a real joker with a people improving him except the last 15 minutes of the movie so for me the movie is a great but not a masterpiece."
4696,What a great movie what a legend actor is just a masterpiece that's it.
4697,"If that not a masterpiece, i don't know what is. Acting, editing, directing, script - all are absolutely perfect! I really think it should win every awards there is out there. It kind of film that should be studying in every film school. Bravo! Outstanding! 100+"
4698,"Best film in my life! I like this movie very much, you can't guess what happens in few minutes!"
4699,"Saw it today, al I can say is wow.
Jaquin Phoenix just performed like one of the best actors ever. In my opinion he even did it better than Heath Ledger.....
its an unfargatable experience, just wow"
4700,"I can not understand how people do not like this movie,everything is great,good story,good soundtrack,good shots and cinemathography what more do you want ?loved it!"
4701,The best film I've ever scene in a while! Talks about sensitive topics in an incredible way. Congratulations
4702,"If heath ledger (rip) has given his life for the role of the joker, Then Joaquin Phoenix has given a life to the joker. This movie smacked me in the face with the title of ""you haven't seen a perfect movie in years, so here is one"""
4703,This film realy is about a rivelution from week people on powerful controler
4704,"The movie was quite awesome, the whole movie was about Arthur and how he transformed in to joker they showed it very clear in this movie and Joaquin Phoenix killed the performance as a joker"
4705,"I don't have words to explain this master piece but this is surely one of the best movies released this decade.Todd Phillips did a great job the cinematography ,story ,acting ,direction everything was so good.One thing that i liked the most was some of its scenes were unpredictable like when he shot Murray ,killed his mom ,all those scenes with that girl were just in his mind. Phenix acting surely deserves an oscar ,he did a great job."
4706,"This is the best film I've watched in the past 5/6 years. The character development, the story, the cinematography - the entire film is a masterpiece. Phoenix's acting is possible the best in cinema history... and I'm not over exaggerating. Hopefully he's not looked over for awards just because it's a 'comic book movie'.If you haven't already, go watch the movie."
4707,"Phoenix performance was UNBELIEVABLE OUTSTANDING WINNING OSCAR.
Although at the end of the movie most of the people are depressed because of it lol.
I wasn't I was stunt and surprised.
If DC UNIVERS make the new batman bettar than Christian Bale they will beat marvile studios easily."
4708,I don't usually write reviews but this movie deserves one. A truely outstanding movie with loads of intense emotions. The acting is fantastic and the soundtrack is so thrilling. It must win an OSCAR!
4709,"Arthur Fleck in Joker is as much a victim of Society as his unfortunate victims. Working at a clown agency with a medical condition that makes him laugh uncontrollably, it's not a funny business for him. He asks for more mental health help, more pills, more than the seven he already takes a day, but Social Services are cut and his pills and therapy part of it. He is abused and attacked at work and is it any wonder he finally snaps. Having a gun should be illegal anywhere. But this is comic book Gotham and these things happen. Todd Phillips directs Joaquin Phoenix as a Joker we can initially sympathise with, while we watch his rage build, and his descent into the Gotham madness begin.Arthur lives in a crummy apartment with his Mum played by Frances Conroy. He is her gentle carer and watches his mother Penny Fleck as she keeps writing to her ex-boss Thomas Wayne for help. Played by Brett Cullen he isn't listening. And the mood in the street is getting darker with a garbage strike and giant rats scuttling round town. But the mood is light in the Fleck household because they enjoy watching Murray Franklin's nightly talk show together. And in Arthur's head Murray played by Robert De Niro is waiting for him as a guest. For Arthur is a would be stand-up comedian, although Penny drily asks whether you need to be funny to do that. She's a wag, but she has a deep dark family secret buried in Arkham Asylum, one that will see Gotham burn. It's a Shakespearean tragedy.But Arthur does his comedy homework and learns his trade by watching other comics. Jotting down what makes people laugh. He even meets a girl down the hall and invites her to his first stand-up show. Zazie Beetz's Sophie is not as embarrassed as we are. Make 'em laugh isn't something that Arthur can do, except for his own maniacal laughter the place is silent. But someone is filming.So Arthur still keeps up his day job, the sad thing is his clown makes kids in a hospital laugh, until a gun drops out of his outfit. Well that's a scream, and of course he's fired. And so is the gun. Mayoral hopeful Thomas Wayne pitches the 'clowns' against the rich, after three of his staff are killed. Causing mass demonstrations in Gotham. We're all clowns now. The cinematography by Lawrence Sher and production design by Mark Friedberg is fantastic, a retro 70's Gotham City, (check the WB logo), and like the pre-gentrification of 80's NYC I remember.Joaquin Phoenix was incredible, he lost 52lbs to play the poor pathetic Arthur. Each sinewy movement of his starved body taut when he practises his quiet tai chi, or maniacal ballet, and all the while straining against the pressure cooker building inside his head.When the police finally track Arthur down, his mother is home alone when they call, and after suffering a stroke is rushed to hospital, where Arthur and Sophie sit with her. They watch as Murray Franklin shows the film of Arthur's stand-up comedy routine that night. It might not have made the punters laugh, but overnight it makes him a tv star. Finally Arthur gets his chance at prime time tv. But how to play it? He needs to practise. It's funny and sad as he copies the guests on the programme. Creating his entrance. We will him to succeed. Could this be Arthur's shot at being the next King of Comedy. Because Arthur does now feel he exists. The poor and wretched of Gotham all exist now. But was he ever really there? Was Sophie ever really there?And for his much longed for tv appearance and his opener. Should he thank his mother first?, she nicknamed him Happy after all, telling him to spread joy and happiness in his miserable life. Should he thank his fellow clowns for their help, because Glenn Fleshler's Randall gave him the gun that helped get him here. They'll all get their turn. But Leigh Gill's Gary is too small to even open the door. Maybe he doesn't deserve any thanks.And maybe after all he'll not even go on as himself, he'll go on as Joker. With amazing hair, make-up and costume created by Mark Bridges, and he'll just tell the truth. And see if they laugh. But you can be sure his act will blow Murray Franklin away.Outstanding work by Todd Philips in an amazing film. As an origins story we are given the bare bones on which the future of Gotham hangs. And DC is definitely in a dark place with this tragic comic who dances a Catch Me If You Can finale."
4710,"OSCAR is calling You Man. Wow wow and wow ... Face expression were out of this world. script , presentation, Direction, Music, Acting, story connection amazing, fantastic, mind blowing"
4711,"The best acting I've ever seen in my life, well done Joaquin Phoenix. No, it doesn't deserve Oscar. Instead, the Oscar deserves Joker."
4712,One of the most cinematography movie that I recently viewed. Really incredible scenes created full of colors and emotion. Entirely story is turn over and over. Nice work.
4713,"It can be only giving to this masterpiece of moviemaking.
__Greetz from 🇩🇪"
4714,"If you haven't watched yet, just watch it immediately"
4715,"Honestly i went to watch this movie for the second time.
I feel the director todd n the actor phoenix have successful to deliver another masterpiece for its viewer.
Besides the violence in the movie, they did make the viewer feel pity about the hard life that joker be in his life and think that what he had done wasn't entirely his fault.
Yet this is the 2019 best movies ever been made.
Congratss."
4716,Go out and see this movie. Phenomenal acting and a beautiful character study creating a truly disturbing portrait of the Joker.
4717,"The basic difference in the movie-making styles of Hollywood and Bollywood is that while Bollywood is adept in making an inspiring tale like that of Anand Kumar to a comical, nonsense trash like Super 30, Hollywood makes a once in a generation movie from a DC comic book character and adds a gem like Joker in its treasure trove. The movie right from the word go grips you, gets into you, grows within you, questions your own sanity and does not leave you hours or days after the end credits have rolled. Backed by a tight screenplay, this latest offering from the director Tim Roth of the Hangover fame, this movie has a chilling undertone in each and every frame. Joker follows the basic theorems of movie-making. There are no unnecessary complications or ostensibly layered outlook, which makes this an edge of the seat thriller. The background score, especially in the transformation scenes, is scintillating. Many people have touted it as a tribute to the Scorsese style of film making. But to be true, barring the Departed, Scorsese never played it so simple in any of his movies. Joker in every sense is a path breaker. It won't be an overstatement to say that Roth has actually outshined another maverick filmmaker of this generation, the great Christopher Nolan in portraying the character of Joker, even though his movie on the same character has different premises.A commentary on this great tale will be incomplete without talking about its protagonist Joaquin Phoenix as Joker. Legend says that he actually lived in the skin of this character for the last couple of years. His devotion, his sacrifice, his understanding of the character-everything is reflected in every single moment of this movie. This is something you don't believe can exist. He is so normal in portraying an insane, abnormal, complex character like Joker that you start believing as if it's happening for real. The pain the society inflicted on him, the fear of failure, and the depression of being a loser in life and finally liberating the inner pathos through his vendetta and seeking pleasure in bringing anarchy in the society- every emotion has been made visceral by the ace actor. If he does not get the Oscar for this, I think millions of movie lovers like me will lose faith in the credibility of the Academy Awards. Like Vivien Leigh of Gone With the Wind, Humphrey Bogart of Casablanca, Jack Nicholson of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Meryl Streep of Kramer Vs Kramer or Natalie Portman of Black Swan, Joaquin Phoenix will be remembered for the decades to come for his iconic portrayal of this iconoclastic character.
P.S- Phoenix makes Joker so real, you may start loving the negative shades. The real movie starts after this movie ends on the silver screen. Get ready to face the Joker in you."
4718,One of the best movies and performances from an actor I've ever seen. OSCAR WINNER FOR SURE!
4719,"Joker WOW What a Movie with a fantastic story. I didn't expect it to be as good. Joker exposes the Wayne legacy and is our new Hero, Never seen it from his side of the story.I understand where he comes from and the struggles with life. Rich class heartless and the government system is dead. Very intense. This deserves an Oscar and Mr Phoenix you are a Legend. Amazing acting."
4720,"I just came from the theater and I had to review, immediately! Juaquin MUST get an Oscar for this. This movie is literally, CRAZY!"
4721,"Chilling from start to finish, movie almost embodies the joker himself. Absolutely manic and shocking. Loved it"
4722,"Just saw Joker (2019) and I thought it was very interesting and engaging.Unlike most DC comic movies where the stories are mostly action-oriented, the story for this film is set out to show the tragic backstory of how struggling stand-up comedian, Arthur Fleck, became the Joker that everyone knows and loves to hate, thanks to his psychological damage and horrible upbringing. So this film is more of a psychological thriller than an action movie.This is one of those rare moments where the Joker was actually given a name for his alter ego, Arthur Fleck. Another instance was back in the 1989 Tim Burton Batman Movie, where he was called Jack Napier as his alter ego.Throughout the course of the film, we slowly start to see how Arthur's psychological trauma takes a horrible toll on his mental health, due to how he was constantly shunned by society, how he retaliated against society and how it affected the entire city of Gotham and how it affected those who loved him the most.Plus, aside from Joaquin Phoenix, the only other notable star I could recognise in this movie was Robert DeNiro, which I never knew was in it prior to watching the film.The costume and make up of the Joker was what caught my attention, as a combination of his maroon and orange suit and having long green hair reminded me of a mix between both Jack Nicholson and the late Heath Ledger's portrayal. Which I thought was a nice touch.The action may have been few and far between at times, but it was only just the beginning for the Joker. Will there be a sequel for this movie? Only time will tell. It's early days yet to bank on one, but it wouldn't surprise me anyway since DC comics movies get sequels and spin-offs all the time.Overall, I give it a 9/10 for its strong story telling, detailed backstory about the psychological trauma Joker himself, a strong leading roll with great costume and make up calling back to Heath Ledger and Jack Nicholson, a good use of a well-known guest star, which is Robert DeNiro and a realistic depiction of Gotham City and being faithful to the comics as always."
4723,"I will start by saying thank u! Everything about this movie was just a pure masterpiece, from the fantastic music to the beautiful cinematography to the mesmerising Pheonix performance, everything was just perfect, and every crew member deserves a big thank u!
This movie looks and the life of one mentally ill Arthur Fleck. I have never seen a movie with such a perfect character development, when u look at Arthur at the beginning and the the Joker in the ending, they are 2 different people, Arthur Fleck is dead and the Joker is born.Joaquin Phoenix brought the best of the Joker , from the unpredictability , the no regard for human life, and the villainous acts that brought the beginning of the clown prince of crime that makes him this deadly lethal villain, who we all know, we can be sure that Hamill , Ledger , Nicholson and Romero are proud of Joaquin.
This movie is 100% oscar worthy, and if Joaquin isn't winning it's a disgrace for the film industry.
Joker will be on my mind for a lot of time, there is a great message and like he said in the ending""what do u get when u cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash? You get what you desrves"".
Thank U for every brilliant moment. I hope The jester of genocide is just starting."
4724,"""I just hope my death makes more sense than my life,"" the tormented Joker, Arthur Fleck confesses in his old journal. This psychological thriller, directed by Todd Phillips is based on the popular DC Comics characters, stars Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker. The origin of Joker dates back to 1981, the film follows Arthur Fleck, a failed stand-up comedian who turns to a life of crime and commotion in Gotham City.This movie got eight minutes standing ovation at Venice International Film Festival at the Premier of the movie, where it won a Golden Lion.In very few mainstream movies, you fall in love with the negative character. This movie is one such and more so because it shows in great length, why the character turns dark; why he chooses the path he had chosen. Dark is a very carefully crafted word defined by movie makers and use it depending on what kind of audience they want to reach out to. The brutality in this movie is meant to shock you and it does the job immaculately.Arthur Fleck is a regular guy who is a clown by day and a stand-up comedian at night. But nobody laughs at his comic stuffs other than himself. He has a condition that causes him to laugh at inappropriate times.In most of the joker movies, character is usually presented with bleached skins and hairs, warped mouth. This adaptation has nothing such rather the city he lives in is the inexorable silo.Arthur sinks in the apathy of the fellow citizens to him. He is a victim of brutality and torment of fellow citizens of the city. The people around him are so wretched; they would queue to beat him up. Ignored in public, he would like to make people smile around him, whether by taking a gun to a children's hospital or by pestering his gorgeous black neighbour. On the other side, he is psychologically sick and socially ignored guy who would snap his mouth to an unsettling fake smile, or a sudden flip of eyes to look at the camera which would shake you. You would close your eyes in shock and dismay.His improved self-confidence after the first attack shows in his elegant dance on the street. He finally fights back after the third attack and shoots the three bankers who attacked him inside the train. He admits, ""I killed those guys, because they were awful"".After the subway shooting, an eyewitness draws an outline image of Arthur Fleck and there begins a movement. The subjugated people of Gotham rise up against the rich. Fleck became a cult star much to his amazement. The city is inundated by rebels in clown makeup and masks.His mom, a poor woman writes letter to Thomas Wayne a business tycoon to help her out in their livelihood and somehow Arthur reads one of those letters, learns something very upsetting. He approaches Wayne from where he had to return shamed as usual. Completely flustered, he kills his mother.His comedy show same night goes badly, as he laughs hysterically and finds difficulty delivering jokes. Talk show host Murray (Robert De Nero) mocks him by showing those clips on his show. He is invited to appear on Murray's show due to unanticipated popularity of that clip. Before the show goes live, Arthur requests Murray to introduce him as Joker with reference to his previous mockery. He walks in to a rousing welcome from the audience but begins telling gloomy jokes and admits of killing those three men in train, and rants about how society discards the oppressed and how he was mocked by Murray. Thereafter, he kills Murray live on television and is detained as riots break out all across Gotham. One of the rioters corners Thomas Wayne, kills him and his wife but leaves alone his son. Rioters also free Arthur Fleck from the police van and he dances to the cheers of the crowd and paints a smile on his face with his own blood when the movie draws to a close.Arthur Fleck's character isn't actually amusing as the name says, but it's gauche, the kind of fidgety, people shy away from in public because of his inconsistent behaviour. It's easy for the viewers to empathize with the character, his craving to be accepted. When he says he feels unseen or invisible, you can clearly realize why. He's the kind of person people would love to overlook out of apathy or uneasiness.Joker is deliberately made dreadful, visually, and psychologically. The movie is grimmer and more distressing than other marvel movies. It gives the audience a power to believe from being powerlessness to powerful. It shows him dancing wildly in public, weeping alone by him when he is oppressed. It shows his sufferings, but at the end it has been shown what he went through was necessary to bring him the power and recognition that he deserved."
4725,"It's one of those huge, over wrought films chock full of great acting, sets, costumes, camera work, lighting. The whole nine yards carried by a murderous man discentigrating before our very eyes, brilliantly played by Phoenix.
Not for the faint hearted. Every second is nerve wracking.
All in the backdrop of New York City which has never looked so actively dingy. It is a world where there is no solace.
Robert DeNiro nailed his role as Johnny Carson style late night host.
Others in secondary characters carried their roles with clear, strong presences.
A must see if you are fascinated by the psychology of a human mind as it whirls & flies apart."
4726,"You should not listen to what anyone says, this movie is a mastepiece. Even now 5 hours after i watched the movie, i still get chills from all the moments in the film. The film does an excellent job at potraying arthurs life and his demise leading him to become the joker. This is not really a comic book movie, it is more a crime movie with certain elements of the batman lore that ties in (good) unexpected ways into the film. Now yes, this does have violence and some disturbing scenes but it is a R-rated film about the joker, if it did not, then the movie would be failure. Everyone reading this should watch the joker and you will even hours after seeing it, feel a shiver down your spine, I guarantee it."
4727,Actor are versatil. Love the music and plot twist. Scary but you will warch it
4728,Best of all. Best of all films baby. Sjjakskaçalalçaçzdksklsçxmdlsçxme
4729,"The movie was great firstly Joaquin Phoenix acting was an Oscar worthy , and we finally see Joker origin in the big screen and Joaquin killed it , the Color consistency was beautiful the music was great , and the evolution of Joker character was amazing, it was funny , dark , entertaining, basically movie of the year."
4730,"Ever since its debut at the Venice Film Festival, ""Joker"" has been considered a modern masterpiece by many people who watched it. Many were calling it a mixture of ""Taxi Driver"" and ""The King of Comedy,"" which are both movies created by filmmaker Martin Scorsese. They were also giving a lot of praise to its lead, Joaquin Phoenix, saying it's possibly one of the most unsettling performances given by an actor in years. With all of these thoughts in mind entering the theater, I had some high hopes. I walked out with my expectations not met but surpassed.This movie is marvelous. When it comes to films and the way they tell stories, this is everything a film lover could hope for. Phoenix is mesmerizing in the role of Arthur Fleck, a very troubled man who is struggling to make sense of his life that eventually leads him to a path of crime. Though his character is awkward in his social interactions and time spent by himself, you can't help but feel sorry for this man who's just being beaten down by society every day. There is an Oscar buzz going around for his performance and it's totally warranted. Phoenix consumes the screen whenever he's on it, which is luckily the entire movieSince this film was based on the legendary comic book villain a lot of people were hoping for the moment Arthur Fleck transforms into the Joker to be a great feeling, but it wasn't a change the audience wants to root for. The filmmakers wisely made the decision to make the character not necessarily likable but understandable. One can understand why the Joker makes the decisions he does but the film doesn't glorify his decisions. When one watches his character arch throughout the movie, there is a sense of dread because you don't really want him to break mentally. This decision, however, makes this an excellent character study and cautionary tale.The other great aspect of the film is its pacing. This is definitely a slow-burning movie but it's never boring. Watching Arthur Fleck from where he was in the beginning to where he ends up is a complete 180 transformation.Throughout the movie, one can tell this man is just like a ticking time bomb, and when the boom explodes, no one will be safe.Todd Phillips, the director, also deserves a lot of praise. This is an amazingly shot and told story. This is by far his best film to date and that was my biggest concern going in. If the Joker was going to get his own feature film, it needed to be a very character-driven movie. The fact that Phillips' most character-driven film prior to this was ""The Hangover"" movies raised huge concerns. Not to disrespect that film, but it's not a high art film. However, Phillips has proven himself to be a director with amazing talent, and I can't wait to see his next project.Another amazing aspect is the cinematography. The color pallets and framing of this film really gets one into the tone of this depiction of Gotham City. Though this film has a dirty and cold exterior, it does have a solid heart at its core.As far as negatives go, I have only minor nitpicks. If anyone has seen the film ""Taxi Driver,"" they will know that a lot of ""Joker"" takes inspiration from that - at times a little too much. Sure, all stories borrow from other stories, and it's not to say that this movie isn't its own thing, but one can easily see that ""Joker"" has a kind of blueprint layout of that movie. There is also a song choice toward the beginning of the third act that I felt was a little cheesy. It was kind of a bigger moment in his transformation and it took me out of the moment a little.Other than that, this is a solid film with a relevant message in today's day and age. It can make one think of the thoughts going on in individuals one sits next to in class, walks past on the street, or sees eating in a restaurant. Who knows, all it takes is one bad day."
4731,"This film is a step in the right direction after the climax of the MCU, it's time for DC to create a new breed of comic book film as there's an infinite amount of possibilities with these charcters besides 12 rated action films with charming characters but overall dull stories that are just stepping stones for a big team up flick. This film manages to perfectly blend comic book material with plenty of subtle call backs that fans of the batman comics can catch. But doesn't rely entirely on it as its clear Todd Philips and Phoniex had there own story to tell and because of that what we are left with is a brilliant character analysis drama which has you hooked from start to finish. Besides perhaps a bit of a slow start, Joker was a ride from start to finish that made me leave the theater wanting to see it again as soon as possible. Support this film at all costs unless you want DC to make more films like Suicide Squad."
4732,It's the perfect. revealing all the current social problem of rich and poor and also all the expressions that they used at the film was very easy to recognize but also was not very simple matters. this film made me to think a lot and very attractive
4733,"JOKER !!!! 2019 CINEMATIC RELEASEDC COMICSI BELIEVE THAT JACQUIN PHOENIX IS NOW THE REAL JOKER. HEATH LEDGER WAS AMAZING HOWEVER JACQUIN IS PHENOMENAL AND LEGENDARY.This film activates so much in your mind, about how this world is neglecting mental health and how they expect everyone to behave the same. Sometimes you cannot sitdown and explain things to people because people simply dont understand.
This film potrays that the constent meetings the constent talks that are useless and uncessary. He as an actor and his character makes you realize so much things and so much truth, because it happens in reality. If someone rich dies the world cries but if someone with an illness such as mentality dies in an alley way, the world does not care at all.This film is dark, powerful, and so disturbing. Jacquin Phoenix is going to win the oscar for this and if he does not then he is robbed. You will be transended into a different world in this film.Must see a piece of masterful art of work in film making. The Score is amazing too and the cinematography is unimaginably beautiful.JOKER SAID WILL MY DEATH MAKE MORE SENSE THAN MY LIFE.10/10"
4734,This movie is amazing an instant masterpiece a movie that surpasses the genre of comics
4735,"This movie is the best take on multiple social problems and the way the movie presents it is very astonishing. Phoenix is the best part of the movie, he gave his 200% in this movie. This shows us a new form of Joker, a character that is broken from inside. The reality that everyone faces nowadays."
4736,"Just... wow! Absolutely BRILLIANT performance by Joaquin Pheonix. Hands down, incredible acting. This really was a standout movie and cinematic experience. Do yourself a favour and go see this mastweliexe."
4737,"This movie kinda reminded me of fight club
The movie had a great meaning how to make yourself happy by imagining , imagining of having friends and women ."
4738,"This movie kinda reminded me about fight club
It is about how to make your self happy , imagination of having friends ,"
4739,"Is Joachim Phoenix portrait of the Joker by far the best and Oscar worthy portrait of an iconic comic figure in film history? It definitely is. Just because of this, this film is worth watching.But is Joker because of that also the best DC Film ever produced? Simply no. It does of course come close to the most iconic ""The Dark Knight"", but there are just too many small plot holes and to many ""slow"" moments in this film to make it to the top.Don't get me wrong. This movie is great. But there would be less point in watching it again, because it's just not that much entertaining for watching a second time."
4740,"This is my first review on IMDb, and that's because I really wanted my first review to be written about a very special movie. I felt this was the one.This kind of approach to one of the most notorious comics character is so welldone that I question myself why there isn't more of this.Arthur Fleck made me feel a lot of emotions while watching his ordinary life, which is so unfair it hurts, and that has a lot to do with Joaquin Phoenix Oscar-worthy performance.There were a lot of scenes that made me quite disturbed, but for me, the most heartbreaking scene is the one when Arthur is on the bus and is told to stop bothering the kid in front of him. His reaction is so believeble, so perfect that shows how good actor Phoenix really is.This movie deserves, without a doubt, the praise that is receiving.
Whoever you are that is reading this, go see it, please. It's amazing."
4741,"Joaquin Phoenix's descent into the abyss of being 'The Joker' is the most compelling single achievement of an actor of this young century - and 'Yes', I'm rating it higher than Heath Ledgers 'thought-to-be' immortal performance.You ask 'Why?'Because I'm certain that this movie will change this society's perspective on mental illness (it kinda already has), disorders and the state of this f'd up society in general. For too long the bottom half was forcefed with plastic TV, irrevelant news to keep them tranquilized and under the lid of our 'so-shiny-perfect-life' where the amount of IG-followers decides over your importance to society.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is a MILESTONE of method acting, a bloodchilling hard-to-watch experience of pain and suffering, an indefinite ride through the pain of a single human being looking for the most human thing there is - love.
'Joker' is a sure award-lock in every meaningful competition this year (Actor, Film, Director, Score, Camera, Screenplay, Script) and Phillips propelled himself into 'take-all-our-money-and-do-what-you-want'-territory from now on.See it before it catches you, I'll definitely see it at least once more because 'All I Have Are Negative Thoughts'.MASTERPIECE!"
4742,"THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE
Joaquin Phoenix's acting's is impeccable for many reasons and it's is a dark gritty way to show the origin story of Batman's Arch Nemesis.
Oscar Worthy Film 100%"
4743,This is some of the best acting I've seen in a long time. It takes a lot for me to concentrate through a whole movie and this had me gripped from start to finish. A background story with so much depth and a big and important focus on mental health and nurture
4744,"I usually write reviews on amazing movie experiences or if my perception of the movie is the opposite of the so called critics.This time is both!I don't think I need to point out anything for Joaquin's performance, Oscar worthy, brilliant, at the same level as Heath, even though the comparison is really inglorious, since this is a standalone movieNow for the movie itself, above all, I believe it conveys a really strong message which most of us would like to ignore, which is the suffering and complications with intense mental disorders.
I am not an American national, but I've been there several times, and I strongly believe that not only, there is still a heavy stereotype for this individuals, but also, given the current social/economic reality, not enough has been done for those who carry this traumas.And while the movie explores this, it doesn't compromise the infamous villain story, it actually brings a wider perspective on his motives and behavior, and how he reached the downward spiral we all witnessed in the Dark KnightI am also not a fan of a specific component of the story line, which they used to cause more impact, I won't spoil it, let's just say they could have used any other character to convey the exact same message.Aside from that, overall it's an intense, dark, bold movie, which contrary to critics mention of bringing nothing new, it actually does.
No it's not a ripoff of Taxi Driver, inspired? Maybe, but if you indeed compare it, I actually believe Joker provides even more in depth to the psychology of the character as well as way more context.It's not subtil, and it doesn't need to be"
4745,"It is good, no doubt. It have great acting yeah. Oh and music was awesome. But what was the point really? I.e. of Joker running left and right in the last scene.
Oh I have no doubt that director would say that it was metaphor for something, like a Joker running wild or getting free in his violence or some other BS. I do not buy it.
And what was with the bullies kicking him when he was on the ground? Why? And doing this 2 times? ""Kick him harder!"" What the heck?
What was it with the Thomas Wayne punching Arthur in the nose? Why? I can't understand nor relate to that. Imagine quite a good guy, a father, businessman trying to be mayor to help people of the city. Why would you punch anybody in this situation? If not self defense every other scenario would be bad for you. Even if you would like to think of the PR after. And you do not make a fortune if you are stupid. I think more realistic would to say something 'you are crazy do not go near my family again' and walk out, right?
For me it was just to depict wealthy and powerful as evil just because they are wealthy and powerful, does not matter if they are evil or not. After all if Arthur mother was really delusional and he was not Wayne son then it means that real victims were Wayne family. Think about it. They employed mentally ill women, she adopted some child then deluded herself to have a child with her employer and when Wayne fired her, make her sign some papers most probably give her good amount of money to convince her not to running around saying that she have his child. I think it is pretty good trade for someone that troubled. After all some other guy beat her up and her adopted son chained to the heater... And after 30 years this child finds you in a toilet convinced that his is your child after terrifying you real child. 'Not this crazy women again' - though Wayne probably. And after that this crazy Joker-Clown revolution kills you and you wife and you son becomes orphan for a few bucks and pearl necklace because this 'not really your child' feels bad with his life after living with crazy mother and here abusive boyfriend. Can't say this is fair.
I am not living in USA but does 'wall street guys' do really ride trains and throws french fries on people? I can't say but seems highly unlikely.
Kinda whole picture seems to show rich people as bad because they have money.
Thinking about it, Joker was in center of this revolution of normal, working class people against wealthy and powerful ones... and we have Joker as a communist, modern Robin Hood type of character? Mentally ill, disfigured Robin Hood I might add. And Robin Hood who does not really care or want to be that and finally threat it is as a joke. I would threat it that also, because essentially this is stupid.
This Joker dance well... I kinda understand his delusion of hearing music. It is kinda Jokery. But at the same time it was kinda lame especially in the scene on the street after crash. Well angry mob is angry. What they want? Chaos probably. If Arthur with his mental illness thought that stupid, lame dance was good idea in his derange mind - to him probably it was. But not for angry mob - to them violently killing one of the policeman from crashed cop car probably would be more what they expect. And what you would expect from Joker really. True to be told I think that whole Joker/Clown revolution was kinda unrealistic. I don't believe it. One mad man do not start that kind of thing entirely by accident without any involvement.
Bruce character was really, really unnecessary IMO it like they would put him there just to show that it is really Gotham: 'oh look here! it is Batman! wink! wink!' But he does not do or say ANYTHING. Does it makes sense? No. You can argue that he was in shock when some thug killed his parents but this would makes more sense for him to shake his mather saying 'wake up mum' or something. But he was just standing there like statue. When Arthur put fingers in his mouth he also did not say or do anything. Really do you know 10 year old like that? It would be funny for him or he would not allow Arthur to do that because it is disgusting... or really something. I was like 'For god sake DO SOMETHING! ANYTHING!'. But no. It was like movie creators were aware that it is Joker movie not Batman movie so you cannot shift your emotion from Joker to sad lonely little boy so they make him a stone statue. Just in case.It was kinda funny though. Arthur joke was funny because it was that much lame that it was funny.I think it is good movie.
But in the same time I did not like it."
4746,"This film was an absolute masterpiece. The overall tone for the film dark and stayed like that throughout. It touches on very sensitive subjects in a way that makes it very real. Now wow the cinematography was so clever so beautiful and the soundtrack/score was absolutely fantastic, one of the best films I've ever seen in my life. I've never walked out of the cinema in absolute awe of a film.The fact that you wake up the next day still thinking about it and doing research on it just shows how much a film can leave an impact. This film finally brings life back to the cinema"
4747,"I was expecting a lousy remake as most of them have been over the past few years. I went into the movie theater cynical and skeptical but came out blown away. Outstanding performance, very detailed and well thought of scenery, etc.
You could not find a more unenthusiastic person to go watch this movie and it has completely won me over."
4748,"Flawless performances, music, camerawork and script. Just full ten from me. Plot was simple, it focuses on the Arthur. Hes life and mental state. Everything else is just static around him, meaningless. If you pay close attention, you can see how surrounding world changes with Arthur's own life. True masterpiece."
4749,"Amazing cinematic experience was Joker. A fresh mind, unknown to the comic books/movies would love this as well as big fans of the dc series. Everything from the score/soundtrack, cinematography, script and stand out alone method performance from Joaquin Phoenix is just insanely good. Love leaving a movie wanting to go straight back to see it. Todd Phillips changed the perspective of his work from comedy's like Hangover, Road Trip etc and released this beautiful picture, a true love of cinema and story telling was put into creating this film. Check it out, was a blast to watch!!!"
4750,"This is my first review and I apologize for its length. I will not reveal any spoilers and it is simply my opinion. I have broken it into two reviews, a quick review and an in-depth review for those who are interested.Quick Review: 8/10The performance by Joaquin Phoenix is something that will be talked about for some time and the movie itself will continue to spark debate. The cinematography is gritty and real and easily evokes Martin Scorsese's New York City of films. While the amount of violence is relatively tame compared to, say a Saw movie, it is very gritty and real, a la Taxi Driver. Superficially, the plot is quite simple: a man gets continually beat down by people and society until one day he hits back, but below that, it is a character study. Todd Phillips stepped out of his usual comfort zone of comedies and has given us a comic book drama. Some people believe that this movie should not have been made and it should be banned, but I disagree. Other than the obvious Freedom of Speech right, I actually applaud the filmmakers for making this movie, not because I agree with the message or because I loved the movie. I believe that it took strength to make this movie. It was obvious from early on in the filmmaking process that this movie would generate buzz and controversy (good or bad), and the filmmakers held their ground and made the movie they wanted. Let me also be clear that this movie is meant for mature audiences only. Don't let the fact that this is based on a comic book character mean that younger audience members should see it. This movie is R-rated for very good reason and parents and/or guardians should be cautioned when it comes to younger audiences.In-depth Review:I don't consider myself a connoisseur when it comes to movies, but I do hold myself above the average moviegoer. I am not a critic and I usually don't write reviews, however, this movie has left me with a feeling I've never experienced before. Let me first say that I am in awe of Joaquin Phoenix. I was very uncertain of how he could portray this character and if I even wanted to see a new Joker; I am of the opinion that Heath Ledger's portrayal of the iconic villain is the best among the movies, followed by Jack Nicholson's classic take. Phoenix is almost unrecognizable, both physically and in makeup, compared to his other famous roles like Gladiator, Her and Walk The Line to name a few.I came out of this movie with an unsettling feeling, something I've never had, not even from the scariest horror movies. Is Phoenix's transformation something to behold? Yes, without a doubt. I truly believe he is one of the greatest actors of our time and even courageous, this movie has been surrounded by controversy and whether you agree with this movie being made or not, it took courage from all who made this to stand by the finished product and see it through to the end.So why was I unsettled by this movie? Did I dislike it? Did I love it? Do I sympathize with the character? I did not dislike the movie, but I can't say I loved it either. When I talk about love for a movie, I mean it is a movie that I would see again and again and everything about it was beyond expectations. I can't say that I will see this movie again and again, in fact I don't really see the need to watch it another time. However, I am very glad I did see it my not seeing it again is not to say I didn't like it. I know there is much controversy about sympathizing with the Joker and that if you do, then you're not a good person, it's not right to be sympathetic to a maniacal killer like Joker. Let me first say that I sympathize with Arthur Fleck, not Joker. Arthur is not a bad guy, he is a man who has a traumatic history and is unable to get adequate help from a flawed system. That, coupled with his economic class and being surrounded by a society of unrest makes me sympathize for him. It is these circumstances that end up creating the villain of the title's namesake.Watching Arthur's descent is difficult and disheartening. It is not one instance that turns this man into the Joker, but the combination of them all. I know there are some who will take offense to what I'm about to say, but I can understand how Arthur becomes Joker. That being said, I understand that there are many people who have endured similar, if not more, circumstances and events, and have never gone on to harm or kill anyone, but this movie is not about those who haven't. Like I said previously, I don't sympathize with Joker, I sympathize with Arthur.Todd Phillips did an amazing job in bringing his vision of the origin of Joker to life. Phoenix embodies the character and gives a performance that will be talked about for years to come. Love it or hate it, this movie will be talked about for its content and it's parallels with our society today.If you are looking to find a movie about redemption and hope, you will not find it in Joker. If you are looking for a comic book movie, you will not find it in Joker. What you will find is a movie with excellent performances from the cast, beautiful and gritty cinematography, a bleak and, at times, unpleasant score that perfectly matches the tone of Gotham City."
4751,"I have been following the movie industry in a pretty long time now and this was worth it all.
It was the ending that got me. How the joker was laughing at a ""joke"", and could not say it out loud because the person infront of him would'nt get it. This opens up to the mystery of the joker, as we do not know for certain what his origin story is, and maybe this movie is just one of the jokers many self-made origin stories.
10/10 - would watch again."
4752,"'We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off'This dialogue from the movie FIGHT CLUB justifies JOKER movie and what i realized is a good childhood is so important for a person to cheer n be happy when he is in his/her 20s and 30s that's the age where we have to do a lot of hard work in our lives and become successful, but sometimes somethings go wrong and it makes you unhappy and depressed so at that moment you think of your childhood memories and if they make you happy then it will definitely give you the hope and you get up again n again but if it haunts you it's the real disaster and then you start doubting yourself which leads to depression and then everything seems so awful that you turn into a person who doesn't care about the society and start doing things without restricting yourself from the small line of right and wrong, you don't care about the consequences, now whether it is right or wrong that's debatable, but JOKER movie tells each n every person that 'see you always wanted to react in this way when someone was cruel with you but you never did' so that's so relatable about this film to each n every person in this world... Joker is everywhere ❤ because everyone is pissed off...#toddphillips1 - great director 👏🏻❤ #bigfan
#joaquinphoenix - great actor ❤ #bowdown"
4753,"The best Joker ever, because now he is a real man with all his life experience ,dark and bright sides 🤡 In love not just with Joker,but with the whole movie. U know sometimes there's no antagonist or protagonist for u , but the Movie itself with all those brilliant details. Cinematic Art, masterpiece ! Had no idea what I was going to watch before husband's invitation...no trailer,no info....Just went and enjoyed and probably not going to read critics. Because I got what I s looking for , So if there is any bighead snob willing to show off his or her excellency Movie taste and super duper pfffs...No , not this time, actually not interested in ... 😏 Double-faced , dishonest, hypocrite liars or typical babyhead marvel/comics lovers re gonna find it boringly gloomy ( Probably )"
4754,"This movie was absolutely phenomenal. Not a comic book movie whatsoever, more like a psychological thriller. Joaquin Phoenix did an AMAZING job and the twist ending was wicked. I hope to see something else come out of this!! Bad ass movie!"
4755,"With all the goofy, CIA-Project-Mockingbird Media surrounding this, PR firms starting fights in the blogosphere, oligarchs in silicon valley (and so DOD) raking in the ad revenue- with all the hype- 'The Joker' is really just a cartoonish character study, and really more of an homage to a certain type of character- a meditation on absurdity and chaos, than it is some 'brilliant psychological' work. The hype surrounding it sort of shot themselves in the foot, considering the violence, agitation, and chaos was coming more from their assumptions, anodyne analyses of the film, than from the film itself. The American people, and others around the world, are just sick and tired of being dismissed, and any characters who can animate this in an accurate way are bound to get attention- they strike a chord, and they should. And for those of you who think this was some brilliant piece of psychology- see the films of Bergman, Cassavetes, Haneke, Dreyer- those are some of the true masters of psychology in film. Not to play down Todd Phillips effort here- he did as good a job as someone could probably do w this material, and it was cool that they had no problem admitting it's homage to films like Taxi Driver and Fight Club. The truth is, until Frank Miller came around, the Joker really wasn't this interesting- people kind of built him this way, especially after the death of Heath Ledger cemented the role's legacy. A much better, more controversial DC character- and better comic in my opinion- has yet to see the screen- Transmetropolitan. Today's environment, with the indictment of Assange, mysterious death and labyrinthine past of Jeffrey Epstein- as Whitney Webb has chronicled on Mintpress News- this cynical, yet noirish technocracy- that is the world of Transmetropolitan. And the hero, or anti-hero, Spider Jerusalem, is what this new Joker wishes he could be. DC- get the best script of Transmetropolitan to Todd Phillips, pronto! You've got territory here that Marvel is clearly scared to explore- the territory of the counterculture."
4756,"Just incredible Joaquin has made me fall in love with the joker! From the laugh to the absolute murderous person he becomes, through other people and the way society treats fellow human beings! Its relevant, its today...and I've always loved the guy...joker or no joker! The dedication, the passion, the cinema photography, hes always been on another level...but my God does this film make you feel and think, with masses of emotion! Hes just a fabulous human being! The stranger the better in my book!"
4757,"This movie is one of the best and most meaningful movies of 2019. It is excellently crafted, with a powerful ending that gives you goosebumps. Truly a film to be seen."
4758,"I loved how dark this movie was, it was enjoyable from start to finish. Joaquin Phoenix did an excellent job!"
4759,"This is cinema, forget what the Oscars have to say. I won't even get into the comparing game between Joaquin Phoenixs's take on the Joker vs Heath Ledger's. This film is living proof that a comic book character and story can dive deep into the psychological aspects of the human mind, all while telling the story of how the human psyche can deteriorate due to unfortunate accounts and circumstances. The cinematography has excellent composition. The acting is out of this world.
The music is haunting, gloomy, and dark. I've never thought that comic book (adaptation) films are just for entertainment. I'm a firm believer that with good storytelling you can make any comic book character interesting, relatable, and serious. I also couldn't help but to get a nerd-gasm when the little kid said his name was Bruce, and his parents' murder at the end of the film. This is a must watch."
4760,"Whether you are a fan of the joker or not, Joaquin certainly draws you in. His raw emotion and intensity in his acting grabs your attention immediately and you can't help but emphasise with him as the joker and feel his heart felt story.
A lot of people will try to compare him to Heath but both actors were absolutely amazing as the Joker. I thoroughly enjoyed this dark tale and look forward to more."
4761,Joaquin Phoenix was born for this role. He's a legend. Music was great too. I have not seen a movie like this for years. I'm really impressed.
4762,"I would it another time for only the final part when he killed Murray.it's not like any another joker movie as it shows the origins of the joker and how Arthur became joker even if it is not related to comics but still fantastic and full of plot twists.
Enjoyed it much."
4763,The joker is a test of the mind and a pure emotion turner.....an absaloute brilliant movie deserves 10/10
4764,"If you are a kid waiting's to watch a graphic superhero movie so don't watch the movie.
It's an amazing movie for everything
Movie of the year"
4765,"From the moment the teaser feast our eyes you would never be mistaken to feel this movie could be almost pretentious. It couldn't be further from the truth. This hands down is a masterpiece. It's dark, mysterious and disturbing. It's brilliant and its down to the performance of one man..Joaquin Phoenix.It's unusual that a film that deals with the darkness of mental health issues makes you walk out with your mind blown, wanting more. This is because Phoenix takes you with him, deep in his conscience, you want to feel empathy, you cheer him.This is not a normal DC superhero film. It's more anti-hero. There are no spoilers here, go out and enjoy and witness potentially what Oscar material is all about."
4766,It's such a good execution. That it's just insane.That's how good it is
4767,"Gotham is a decaying and depressing city with Arthur trying to be a ray of sunshine in the darkness (he works as a clown for an entertainment company), but he is repeatedly mistreated and largely ignored by society, making him become increasingly aggressive even towards those he loves. He eventually becomes an icon of rebellion as he starts to become more and more relentless, eventually craving his newfound attention and fully embracing it. Many thought the character of this iconic villain was tainted by Jared Leto's performance in Suicide Squad, but this fully compensated it, Heath Ledger sure as hell would be glad about this. This film proves that sometimes it's lengthy character development that makes a better film than frequent action sequences and CGI. So by all means, believe me when I say that the hype is deserved, it's well worth your time ;)."
4768,"There's no chance I can sum this movie up fully here. All I can say is that in over 30 years of moviegoing the experience of watching this was so different than what has come before. It actually makes you think, its utterly disturbing but incredibly compelling. Phoenix is sensational but unflashy in a way I never felt a performance could be. See it break it down into its parts and then try and reconstruct it. Amazed and confused at the same time but my god what an experience."
4769,#joker movie is very awesome and amazing jockain aka joker is versatile actor paisa vasool movie and not bully for other people
4770,"I am just coming back from the cinema, so I'd like to express my opinion while still emotionally affected. That was a great introduction of Joker and amazing actor play by Joaquin Phoenix. At the end of the movie I felt like all Gotham pieces just got conneted. Great job."
4771,"Wow. I need to go back and see this again. And Again. I struggle to remember an acting performance this riveting. Once is not so often, we stumble upon masterstrokes in acting performanceTom Hanks in Forrest Gump; Russel Crowe in A Beautiful Mind; Denzel Washington in Hurricane; Meryl Streep in The Iron Lady; J. K Simmons in Whiplash; Robert Downey Jr in Tropic Thunder. I need to add Joaquim Phoenix in the Joker to this.
What he achieved here is telling what pop culture has asked for decades: how the Joker came to be. He did this so well, we may look at the character in a totally different light.
All other actors should start working on material for the 2021 Oscar best actor award. 2020's award's already taken."
4772,"""Disqualified as a human beings. I had now ceased utterly to be a human beings.""
'No Longer Human,' Osamu Dazai."
4773,"I did not have high expectations for this film, the trailer did not convince me at all. I just wanted to give it a try. I mean all movies based on villains from comic books have been pretty much trash, and also superhero movies have been using the same old formula without taking new directions. However, this film can be watched by people that don't find interesting the genre. The performance of Joaquin Phoenix in portraying a person with mental illness and how a sick society that does not care for an average person can lead a person to commit crimes is outstanding. Highly recommended."
4774,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie but thought, I need to see what the buzz around this controversial film is.To put it simply - I'm not sure the film is for the faint of heart. It is two hours of deep, soul destroying pain. You watch a man become destroyed mentally and physically. It can be hard to watch at times but that's what drew me in even more. The depiction of mental health may not be portrayed 100% accurately but JP does a damn good job of acting it. Even after the first few scenes I found myself rooting for this 'bad guy'. By the end I was questioning why I was backing a violent mob and a crazy clown but hey, it gives new light on films like The Dark Knight which I now need to watch again."
4775,"The Clown Prince of crime has returned to the big screen in his very first, ground-breaking, solo movie! JOKER! Though anticipation is through the roof for this movie, can Joaquin Phoenix deliver us an uncanny performance enough to beat Heath Ledgers Joker of the Dark Knight Trilogy or equal him? All we know is, we need to review this film before we start laughing our heads off!Plot
In a time before the Batman. Gotham City has become a corrupt, lawless hell on Earth. Our story follows Arthur Fleck, a failed stand-up comedian suffering from a mental illness that effects his emotional state. As Arthur's life continues to take a turn for the worse, he slowly descends into insanity which eventually leads him into becoming Gotham City's most feared criminal of all time. The Joker.Likes
The Joker is portrayed as a dark, classic, psychological style thriller with themes inspired by a 1970's society. It blends the superhero genre and elements of classic crime films and noir style storytelling. And the cinematography and camerawork is impressive and captivating within its themes.The plot is simple and extraordinarily well written. Even from the first act of the film you are left at the edge of your seat in awe as the story occurs which in a way is portrayed so differently, that it makes it very unpredictable to know what happens next. And in this day and age of Superhero films, different is better.
Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker is the best thing about this movie and even his performance itself makes it clear why this film exists. His take on the Joker is original and fresh without any inspiration from Joker actor previous. Not only does Phoenix Joker give us a fully developed, fleshed out look into his origins, but also defines the ruthless nature and injustice that made him what he is today. Just seeing how his previous life in Gotham has been tragic for him every day and learning of the trauma he had as a child makes you feel pity for him having suffered so endlessly from bullying and rejection. Making you think just how small your issues really are in comparison to himself. I even have to admit that Phoenix portrays the character so well that he even makes the Joker sound like a real-life person.
Which is clearly enough to rival even Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight. And it's also safe to say that he is 100 times better than Jared Leto's dull and crappy portrayal of the Joker from Suicide Squad. Unlike him, Joaquin Phoenix portrays the Joker accurately to his Personality and his appearance.
Also loved some of the nods that this film throws around in the story. Such as The Jokers past taking some inspiration from Alan Moores The Killing Joke. And also having Bruce Wayne and his parents feature as a plot point in the movie (And not forgetting his parent's deaths which would result in his transformation into Batman). Even if Todd didn't read that many comics during production. He certainly didn't forget the most important references within the lore.Dislikes
Now, for some reason the Joker has been causing recent controversy in the media for its glorified violence and allusion that it would inspire people to become Mass Shooters. Well... The Joker only shoots 4 people in this movie (three even in self-defence) and kills the other 4 unarmed so how is all that bad compared to character body counts in other movies? But since this controversy is obviously pointless to list here, I'll just go with my own non-political criticisms.
Now there are aspects of the Jokers story that does leave more questions than answers. Like, whatever happened to the romantic sub-plot between Arthur and his estranged girlfriend (Zazie Beets)? At first they were going somewhere with it then all of a sudden the plot just disappears halfway through the movie and she is never mentioned or seen again.
Why did Arthur kill one of his former co-workers for? Sure he may have been a jerk to him but he did have respect for him and wanted to help out.
Spoiler Warning!: Since Arthur is already Identified as the subway killer earlier in the movie by the police, shouldn't that mean Jokers identity is pretty much exposed since he killed Robert De Niro live on TV and started riots? But I feel the plot just ignores it saying ""Nah, he's too much of a loser for the city to even know him."" Still realistically in a world of Television, Forensic scientists and detectives, his identity would be as good as revealed soon after.
Lastly, it didn't really portray the definition of Mental Illness that well like I hoped it would. Like, Arthur strives to do his best in life with what he gets, but he seems to treat his growing mental collapse as if it is incurable. That is wrong. People can in-fact fight back against it and some have even managed to find the right help so as to be able to control it and perhaps even cure it. But that seems to be the exact opposite of what this film's moral indicates. I'm autistic and I have lots of problems. But the last thing I would want is to kill innocent people just because I didn't put enough effort in restraint. But I guess Arthur Fleck is just as human as everyone else I suppose.Verdict?
Just when you thought Deadpool was the undisputed R-Rated Superhero film of all time. The Joker may have just knocked the Merc with the Mouth off of his Perch. Though it can't help being controversial to many with its violence and subliminal message, Joker offers every Batman fan a chance to experience the clown prince of crimes story first hand in the most imaginative way possible. Offering an original twist with thrilling moments of suspense, drama and dark comedy that the Joker himself has become well known for. Right or Wrong, The Joker is a crazy good time that might even have the Oscars turning their heads this year.
I give Joker an 8/10."
4776,"'For my whole life, I didn't know if I even really existed. But I do and people are starting to notice' - Joker
Joker is what we truly aspire to be but never really become. Joker embraced who he was and let his true dark instincts take over his once frail identity, arthur. Rise of Joker was inevitable as circumstances and fate demanded the negative force into existence. Arthur was really non existent in society until joker was born.
Im fascinated with themes such as anarchism, anti establishment, class differences and poverty. Another movie with a somewhat similar theme is V for Vendetta. Some scenes in this movie, the way it's shot has similarities with taxi driver, black swan and prisoners. I've now watched it thrice every consequtive day. Every frame is captivating, every scene is transforming, inspirational and thought provoking. And this can only occur if the creator and cast devote themselves to a deep character study of the protagonist. Issues such as mental illness, bullying and abuse are central to the films story without which there won't be any character development and as a result, no joker. I felt emotions so strong that words fail to describe how I feel. This movie was an immensely immersive and hypnotizing cinematic masterpiece, an experience that I will never forget. Engraved in my soul forver ! 'its beautiful' Jokes says while being taken in a police van to prison. Because after causing riots and anarchy across Gotham, joker realises causing chaos is such a wonderful feeling because that's the only world joker knows. Chaos, disorder and violence. And that's perfectly in harmony with joker as that's definitive of joker traits. No wonder he is agent of chaos. God of chaos !"
4777,"Great movie, exceptional joker performance and dont understand how some people dont appreciate this great masterpiece."
4778,"First time ive ever reviewed a movie and this is deserving of my first, Joker was gritty, dark, intense and i absolutely loved it! His life was in fact a tragedy that in the end he saw as a comedy and that itself is heartbreaking to me, and as he got knocked further down by the world and people and events happening around him and descended more and more into madness it was quite sad to see him become Joker which i thought was powerful , but  his acting was incredible, the standard was ridiculous it even made me emotional marvelling at how insanely good he was on screen. Joaquin will win best actor at the 2020 Oscars, as nothing comes close to me in years. Todd Phillips shot a beautiful movie to look at, sleazy and grounded in realism so fair play to a guy no one beforehand believed he could pull this off with the announcement he was directing. And to top it off the score was beautiful and menacing. 9/10 for the film 10/10 for Joaquins performance, cant wait to see it again, And please no sequel it isnt needed atall!"
4779,"This is the film every aspiring actor and director who have had a hard life full of struggle and depression dream of creating. It's a film you only dream of being apart of to show the full range of emotions possible, and to expose the truths of how dark the world is to kind gentle people. It pisses me off I couldn't have been the star of this perfect film to fully let loose all the pain I have buried inside as an aspiring actor, and be cemented in cinema history. Bravo Todd Philips for creating the perfect film!"
4780,"After paying 600pkr (£3.30) for a ticket I went into it thinking 9/10 IMDB pffft yeah right, like I've watched so many good films it's gotta be absolutely amazing for it to be added to that list because I just didn't know how they would pull it off and that aswell with no like build up such as a batman film before, not in the DCEU or anything else it was just a stand alone movieThen whilst watching it, it was so unpredictable that I was just constantly thinking wtf why am I enjoying this so much then I realised his acting (and the score omffgggg) just takes you on a rollercoaster that by the end of it your on his side and cheering him on like he's the heroThere where 1 or 2 bits I didn't like but overall one of the best movies I've seenIn my opinion"
4781,"At first I had some doubts about this movie fulfilling high expectations that were put around it, but after I saw it all distrust that I had before transformed into joy and amazement. It shows perfectly well how can society's mistreated individuals destroy the system that poisoned their being. A picture that displays so exceptionally the story that drives it, really does deserve your attention."
4782,"6 out of 5.What are you expecting? Mark Hamill's Joker? Heath Ledger maybe? Jared Leto before he went to a punk rock bar or maybe Jack Nicholson and Tim Burton? Let me offer you one word advice. Go in without expectations. The movie is far more darker than Tim Burton can imagine and more mentally disturbed than Ledger's protrayal.In this movie there is no dramatic music pounding in the background. There is no superhero. Honestly, you can drop the entire Joker/Batman thing and still have a movie that is truly a masterpiece. What there is, is a great and unnerving story powered by Joaquin Phoenix's flawless performance. He commanded every scene with the skill unmatched by anyone I have seen in a long time.Do yourself a favor. Drop your expectations. Forget about Batman. Go to the movies and watch this in the dark. Oh yeah, hit the bathroom before you go in. You won't want to get up for any reason."
4783,"Truly captivating, however the Critics and Media still want to make this movie/character look terrible to push their own agendas. Meanwhile there is a real lesson behind it. Society is twisted and wants to make those who aren't in their mindset look crazy or ""weird"". 10/10 movie. Went to see it a second time"
4784,"A Dark, raw Joker origins movie,with an extraordinary acting from Joaquim Phoenix, worthy of all the oscars in the world..."
4785,"One of the best. Would it compete with top rank of ""imdb top 250 of all time""?
And also, the soundtrack is top notch too!"
4786,"This dark movie sets the bar for DC very high. It is a hard movie to describe without spoiling but I will try my best.One of the main things this movie achieves is tone. The tone perfectly shows our main characters struggles and challenges which led him to madness. It goes from funny and unnerving to sad and sympathetic while still keeping a coherent story. It doesn't dwell on scenes to long and it shows the audience just the right amount to keep them engaged. The acting was good throughout The Whole film and it felt like real people talking and not actors.One of the main problems I had with it was a sorta day dream sequence. It felt out of place and they could have presented the same information in a more interesting and creative way. It wasn't that big of a problem, I just thought is was a missed opportunity.All in all, great film."
4787,"My second review in IMDB. I went to watch this film for a second time and I'm considering a third. I have never, and I mean, NEVER, wanted to go back and watch a movie again and again. As other commenters - I admit that I also understand why the movie causes division. I understand the political views, I understand that many shooting victim relatives are worried this could somehow spark an individual with the desire to shoot, to really do it, I understand the movie TALKS openly about mental illness. I am so sorry to all victims. But you should understand that this movie is not MEANT to empathize Arthur through allowing yourself to justify his actions. He is a broken man, he was abused to the point he lost his way. People get all kinds of bullying and a lot of people survive though it, yet a lot of them don't. They either end it or they turn into the darker side - a coping mechanisms, sick mechanism. But this IS the human. It is complex, it is an endless encyclopedia and I think it is of a great importance to show this. Maybe the word you're searching for is heartbreaking. We see a man who could have survived through the bullying, but instead he gave himself to the demons, because of constant social suppression merged with the mental illness he already had. It is how it is. Should we ignore it? Should we slam it just because it's political, or because it's showing guns, or because it touches the topic of mental illness, or anything else that sparks controversy? No... Yes, these topics are complex, it's not news, it is the hardest things to talk about, but I think it's bold and brave to make this film and I appreciate the whole cast and crew for making it. This film shows all of it, all raw from the human soul. And what makes it good is, as our screenwriting lecturer in our film course explains, we show a complex character, which does bad things, but we understand why he/she does them. We are not MEANT to sympathise, empathize, but UNDERSTAND why they did what they did.I am sorry for those who find it dark or too involved in these topics. But I think it's extremely important for this movie to be here, to teach about things they don't tell us in school, but also to provoke yourself, to see what you should never turn into. This movie is NOT urging people to become criminals. No, no, no, no, no. It's supposed to make you sick, it's supposed to make you want to leave the room, because you don't want to ever end up in this situation. Because we understand how horrible all of this is. Unfortunately, not all people will understand this movie. And this is where all the negativity comes from. As I said, I understand the so many relatives, friends, acquaintances of people who have died in similar scenarios, I understand why they are worried. We don't know who is watching this movie, we don't know what is going through their head. And unfortunately, it may cause a spark in them. But if this movie is not out, we never see it. We never understand. We never are aware, we don't have the proper knowledge of it. Because me knowing more about mental illness teaches me how to protect, how to react, how to preserve. It teaches me to treat people right, to be there for them, to NEVER do them wrong. And trust me, one person is not a lot, but it is something and it could save a soul.It is a difficult film, but it was shown flawlessly."
4788,"Wow. Believe it or not, it was even better the second time i saw it, because i knew the story and could look for things. I thought I would be able to better understand what is 'real', and what is not the second time, however the writing is so brilliant that you just do not know. We have not seen many movies like this over the past 20 years, and this will be iconic for a long time. Possibly the movie of the generation. I cannot support this film enough. It should win pretty much every major oscar award, including score of all things. Simply wow."
4789,"What a movie, Joaquin Phoenix is perfect, pictures are truly amazing and the atmosphere is terrifying. The best movie I've seen since years."
4790,"UnbelieveableThe film stars as Aurther Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is shaping his face as if he is smiling but he is not he is crying inside. He is crying for help. He is crying for respect which he never got. In very second scene of the movie, Aurther Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) was laughing, and looking at him a smile was about to break on my lips too, but that laugh of Aurther started getting weird, and before I could laugh I was in absolute shock. The look on my face was just amazement. And I was slowly clapping my hands for Phoenix. This actor managed to impress everyone just within two scenes of the film, and this is some seriously incredible achievement.The film is set with 1981s backdrop, Aurther Fleck a guy who lives in this fictional Gotham City. A man who is nothing more than a joke to those around him. Such a man that fifteen sixteen-year-old children pass by beating and humiliating. And he is not completely normal. He is suffering from many mental problems. And that is what film shows that how situations turn an innocent character into a brutal murderer.Setting the film in 1981s period was a very smart move by Todd Phillips. This Gotham City looks gorgeous and scary place to live at the same time. Thanks to Lawrence Sher's mind blowing work behind the camera. Film's colour palette is absolutely beautiful. Dark feeling of film is to tell you that Gotham City is full of crime, it is lawless, there's no justice for anyone but the rich. I salute Todd Phillips for having the balls for making something like this.This film deserves a lot of respect and appreciation not ""the film is too dark"". Joker is criticized that it can promote violence. It is said that the violence is glorified in the film. , the film is neither promoting violence nor glorifying it. In fact, this is something the film is totally not about. The movie is about how people with mental problems like Arthur reach to the point of becoming ""Joker"".""madness is like gravity all it takes is a little push.""I can't believe that people are hating this film because it is violent and brutal and dark and all that. What you were expecting? that he'd kill people by telling bad jokes or what? this is absolutely nonsense. People are familiar with this character. Joker was a mass murderer. It had to be brutal and dark to do full justice to this character since he's getting his solo movie.I humbly request to those bashing this film because of its subject, that it doesn't dipict the mental illness properly, please don't. Don't do this. Todd Phillips has made a great film that deserves every bit of respect and appreciation."
4791,Well that was grim. Joaquin Phoenix has to be a shoo in for the Oscar. A riveting totally believable depiction of someone suffering mental illness. A great soundtrack and cinematography. As far removed from Todd Phillips previous work as it possibly could. The last hour is absolutely gripping but be prepared for no laughs. You wouldn't want to be in bad form going to see this. There's nods to King of Comedy and the Batman story but in reality this is very accurate depiction of how people with mental health issues are treated and it's not a pretty picture. Not the best movie I've ever seen but Phoenix's performance is up there with the best.
4792,"Not a movie type I like. It's give way too much negative energy that I can't take it but it's had a special magic that will lure you to see this wonderful act again. can feel pain,helpless, sadness in his laughter that bring u chill in every part of your bones.It's send a powerful message that Everyone can become a joker if the environment betray and don't accept them. the world will be a better place if we shown some love and patience
to those have trouble expressing themself.
I totally love this movie."
4793,"Been hyping Joker for the past 5 months (since the teaser trailer dropped) and it really lived up the expectation. If not, it felt better than any expectations out there.When I watched the teaser, I know this movie will be that kind of movie that gets stuck in your head until you're no longer breathing air. It's solid, beautiful, disturbing, funny, and extremely memorable.I love every second of it.It's a no surprise that Joaquin Phoenix outdo himself (again) in this role. He has caught every essence of Arthur Fleck and executed it as uniquely possible.Todd Phillips's direction was light but beyond meaningful. He helped Phoenix perfected his storytelling and it matched every main aspects of filmography; music, cinematography, editing, script, and of course acting.The score from Hildur Gudnadottir was also an excellent match for the whole film. It's haunting, intimate, personal, daring, and unsettling. Her music really molded the film's soul from the very first scene. Just beautiful.Watched it (so far) for three times. And I was in heavenly experience for three times. Go. Watch. It.Wrote my first watch review on my blog fadhilasupriana.blogspot.com go check it out!"
4794,"First of all, I saw it for the second time yesterday just to be sure about my thoughts and yes I was much more brutal about something in the movie but I feel a bit different now.Excellent cinematography, great sceneography and splendid acting by Joaquin Phoenix YET I found some element missing. Let me first make it clear. I don't really know about DC world and the stories and for this case Batman. I chose to see this movie as a completely different world than Joker from DC. So here we have a man who is having psychological problems and goes crazy after what happened to him lately. Don't get me wrong. Movie is great overall but there is this problem I'll write about and it makes the movie ''not enough'' I'd say. Some people complain about how different this joker than the other joker(like its not like a comic thing) and it seems like similar compositions with ''Taxi Driver'' or ''King Of Comedy'' make some people ''oh its so same so its bad...''.  However, these or other things that most people are talking about are not my point breakers at all.So what are the problems?The problem is lack of incidents for Joker to become Joker and plot it self. For those who don't know much about technical side of the screenwriting, your protagonist should be likeable or at least able to make the audience feel empathy for him/her. Even we feel connected to bad characters sometimes. Please note that, I am not supporting the idea of everything should be done by some strict rules in cinema like I gave the example of character building but apparently it is not so successfully done in this movie. I am getting the point. Obviously joker went through something even before the movie starts and we get to see him suffer after the movie starts. He gets beaten a couple of times, tries to be a comedian and fails and discovers that he is adopted and his favorite tv show man makes fun of him for his sickness ect. In that sense, the question here is: Did we feel for joker? The answer is maybe yes but believe me it was not enough. At least not enough to become a symbol for the city and start a riot. I mean camo'n... He kills three rich men, and police suspects someone dressed like a clown. So this triggers poor people to rebel with clown masks? I know there is an unemployment problem and they are going through an election, people are ready to explode already but it just still does not persuade me. The very first thing triggers his becoming Joker process happens in the beginning in the train. Especially the last scene where they save joker from the police car. Joker did't feel powerful enough to make lots of people save him and put him in a leader chair. No, he did not! I just pity him for what happened to him and thats all. There must be something bigger than that.The movie doesn't give enough reason in terms of making audience feel enough for the protagonist to change so that we actually can believe he may lead something but this did not happen. Also, 8 stars is for what i said in the beginning. Everything other than that done so well that nearly makes me forget the fact that i mentioned about. I just wish the plot was a little more intense for joker.All in all, still, it was enjoyable to watch thanks to great visual storytelling. Great job by Todd Phillips and his cinematographer Lawrence Sher. They did comedy before and i really was amazed how they pulled that drama off. I liked some details like the part where the rich people watch Modern Times and enjoy it which is really critically done. You see, film is overall great but plot could've done better for joker's change in my opinion. Also what the hell is wrong with people saying ''It was the best movie ever''. This movie is a true piece of art but for god's sake don't make it overrated.So good with some crucial missings"
4795,"I thought that the movie was shot really well, the colours and the digital look really made it gritty and it fits the story it's telling. There are some aspects of the story that I liked but there is a lot of things untouched, and a lot of just dumb stuff.Phoenix really deserves an Oscar Nomination at the very least, but for me the whole character of the Joker is still better in the Dark Knight than this. Phoenix fits for this one. Ledger was fitting for that one.Directing-wise there was a lot of creative shots and sequences but overall it didn't blow me away, but the score was so unsettling and well used that I was pleasantly surprised.The sound editing was also really slick too.Every other main performance was good too.It's really well paced.
But some parts are really predictable and a lot of things have no shock value at all.My biggest issues are the story and the overall themes and messages of the movie.I don't wanna go in-depth with the plot because I could do it all night long, but the themes and messages are either really sick, or just non-existant. I guess nihilism and mental illnes both play an important part but I can't find any actual human thing other than those.Maybe a bit about popularity and meaning of people and money.but....
SPOILER
The whole thing with the Wayne Family, especially the end scene was soo forced. It really didn't have to be there and it made me think about the businessmen rather than the actual characters."
4796,"Like all great movies, I need a few hours after the first viewing to absorb, and reflect. I'm talking about Joker. This is spoiler free, don't worry.It's a rare thing to go into a film that lives up the the hype. Well, this one surpasses it. The story itself, we've seen kind of before, a person who's just been pushed too far, but here it's different, it's not a guy breaking bad, it's the story of a man who from the outset is disturbed to his very core, a man already gone over the edge, he's literally fallen so far, he's landed where he fell off.His descent into further madness is portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix is not borderline genius, it's more than genius, every minute he's on screen, there is minor changes in his character that has to be surpassed from the previous minute. I have to wonder what his sanity is like after wrapping up. From the contortions of his emaciated body, to the expressions of absolute mental torture during his maniacal laughter. He is glorious, and I have never seen any actor give a performance like this. You know you should be appalled by his actions, but you cannot help but feel sorry for such a tortured character. Forget about the Oscar, he should get every conceivable award this year for this performance.This leads me to Director Todd Phillips, he does a masterful job in tying everything together, but I can't go into that too much as it will lead to spoilers. The mood of a frustrated and explosive Gotham City is depressing as the mood of the world we live in now.The soundtrack is great, some fantastic tracks from the time period as well as some really very haunting tunes from the same artist who worked on Chernobyl, The Handmaids Tale and The Reverend, ok I had to check IMDB but if your a fan of those shows and movie, you'll know what I mean, Hildur Guðnadóttir is her name and it's now on my phone, and I'm listening as I type.Everything about this movie is perfect and a real joy for a fan of the Bat, and yes there is tons of connections. Check out Bruce's treehouse, a wonderful blink and you'll miss homage to the 60's Batman tv show. a rare hyped movie that will have a cult following forever. 
11/10"
4797,"It's amazing how the film sequence goes so well, the great director's work makes you put into joker's life and how he sees the society and the world. This couldn't be possible without Phoenix's performance, its an amazing job than I haven't seen in a while. This movie can makes you feel sad at the end because you can understand a little part of how this kind of psychiatric persons may feel, and how the society ignore them. I've never had that feeling like that."
4798,"Now, I must say even hearing about the film and seeing the trailer, I actually wasn't looking forward to this film .. it was only till my friends had seen it and came back raving with so much hype I had to go see what all the fuss was about.And let me tell you it was worth ALL THE HYPE! Truly one of the best films of the year if not THE best, I was gripped throughout, literally the movie has every element of your emotions, it's a crazy whirlwind and thanks to the acting it really makes some parts feel real. You will leave that cinema dissecting every part of the film, your brain won't stop thinking about it for days.Joaquin was truly magnificent and cannot be faulted, the best acting I've seen in a while. This movie is definitely worth a watch even if you don't fancy it from the trailer. See it for yourself. Be focused and enjoy this crazy wonderful film.The best Joker yet. Give it all the Oscars!"
4799,"When I heard about the fears about the possibility of violence at the opening of this movie, I thought ""there's no way it's actually as much as a wet dream as people think it is."" Welp, it is.Arthur has no redeeming qualities. Taking care of your mom and weirdly bathing her does not a relatable character make. His ""descent in to madness"" is shallow because he was there the whole time - his psychosis/hallucinations were not new given that he had already been institutionalized before the events of the movie. Arthur's pain is used to justify his atrocities and with no redeeming qualities it is kind of gross at how many people see him as a ""relatable"" character.Turns out the guy who thinks PC culture is ruining comedy still thinks it's funny to make fun of little people. Shocking.If you want better depictions of mental illness then watch Netflix's Maniac or Amazon's Undone."
4800,"The unique perspective causes you to feel quite empathetic for a character capable of great evil.
Minus one star because the clown makeup was applied a little too heavily in the final scenes of the movie, obfuscating the actors face. I found some of the amazing facial expression from earlier in the film was lost."
4801,I think it was the best movie i have seen in 2019 till now. Best performances from actors and a script with smooth speed so you can feel everything inside the movie. It's not like other comic books with super powers and there is no strange special effect in the movie. In my opinion it was the purest Joker character I have ever seen my whole life and from now on we can respect Jokers because they were in severe pain and in the movie you can feel the pain with each of your cells. Some people say it is a violent movie but it is a necessary part of movies that use exaggeration to learn us something and not leading us to violence but lead us to reason. I was satisfied with the movie and all of its items.
4802,"Firstly I want to say that this was a masterpiece all round. The cast, crew and director have made such an incredible movie.Secondly if you're going to watch this movie because it's the Joker a villain of Batman and you think that they will end up fighting then it's not for you. Joker is more of a phscological thriller than a superhero movie. In this film you have to play close attention so you can grasp the concept. I think a bit of Joker knowledge will help you understand what you have just watched.Thirdly I believe that the point of the movie is to make us question every last little bit and try an figure out what it is we have just watched. Was it all a dream? Was half real and half fake? The questions go on.I personally believe that in this movie it all plays out the way we see apart from the ending. We know that Arthur fantasies and creates his own story so I believe after he kills Murray he is taken away, Gotham is on the brink of chaos and he sees this and revels in it. But he doesn't get rescued, Arthur invents this part. The truth is he's arrested and taken away to Arkham Asylum (Or the movies version of Arkham) I could be wrong but the hair dye doesn't look like the type that would be in your hair a while it only looked like the ones that go after a few washes. So when he arrives at Arkham they will wash him and take away his make up, I think to take away his power of being Joker.When he tells his psychiatrist that she wouldnt get the joke that he was laughing at. I believe the joke was referencing the choas that would follow what he has done and then he kills her so everyone fears him more.This is all my take and you can take what you want. I will also be interested in what you have to say about the movie.."

Read many reviews about this classic! Each review focused on acting, cinematography, music, direction, the beauty of art and all that shit which are normally spoken by those who doesn't care a bit about them! .
.
When a novel , a movie, music concert or be it anything. when it carries that magic within, it will flow like a water everywhere irrespective of boundaries.. thats the only moment and one magical moment in every artist's life, when his NOVEL is accepted and praised not his writing skills. Ofcourse his skill counts! But for an artist when you only appreciate technical accepts and ignore the content of it, that merely feels like a meaningless appreciation to get his attention or public's attention! .
.
This JOKER carried that magic within and it is flowing everywhere irrespective of boundaries.
.
.
Arthur requests to introduce himself as #joker not because he liked to be called as #joker, because he was rejected and insulted publically by calling him as #joker!! Because he stood for TRUTH! He stood for what is RIGHT!! .
.
If you look around and watch sensitivity you will find billions of JOKERS who were unable to realise how big JOKERS they were before calling someone a JOKER!! .

4804,"Today an entire theatre was silenced. Well mostly, I mean commenting is unavoidable in a hall. But yeah. At one point my jaw was literally hanging open for a fairly long period. I was entirely aware of it but was compelled to keep it open, because I couldn't shut it willingly.That's not an everyday experience, especially being desensitized by the constant consumption of media. And as a Joker fan I thought I knew him, that I'd seen it all. That his mind was as familiar as a well read book. I don't mean he's predictable, after all the Joker is well known for upsetting expectations. Rather, certain actions fit the Joker psychologically. So when he pulls one of his characteristic moves you're like, ah yes, a classic Joker. But the Joker had to, well, pull a Joker on us all. Because I saw none of that coming. There were these moments where I'd stare at the screen saying to myself, did I see what I just saw? What did I just see?At the end of the movie I was left feeling simultaneously discombobulated and yet Sublime. I can't explain it, what it is or why it is, but I feel amazed at seeing something amazing. Usually I'm articulate enough to come up with some reason as to why something made me feel a certain way. In this case I've got nothing. I think I need to see the film again just to figure out my exact opinions. Or maybe I won't have an exact opinion. Maybe that is the point of the movie, that not everything can be labeled neatly. That sometimes you can only enjoy the chaos.Rarely there are these gems of comic book movies that transcend the norms. That offer a unique and transcendental experience. Logan and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse are one of those few and Joker has joined their ranks. Congrats to DC.Update: I totally recommend watching this movie alongside Inception. I feel like these films speak to each other."
4805,"One of the best movies I have ever seen. We'll be remembering joker for this movie now, and not for the dark knight"
4806,"I don't think this is the actual origin story of the Joker, but nonetheless I liked the movie. I am not a critic but if I have to summarize this movie, I would just call it ""One person's Descent to Madness"". Even if the protagonist(antagonist) wasn't Joker and was just a random John Doe, it would still be a good movie to watch. But this movie is not meant for everyone, and I wholeheartedly understand that. Some of the part may be cliched and similar to some other movies, but I still enjoyed watching this movie."
4807,"Joker is a different take on a character done many times before. The whole movie is quite different than I remember the character being in any other comic book or movie, and you have to go with it. Joaquin Phoenix is incredible as the afflicted Arthur Fleck. And watching him transform into the Joker character is very cool to watch. But, I feel the movie didn't go quite far enough into that next character. I thought surely it was going to end with his character being the Heath Ledger character at the beginning of The Dark Knight. It didn't quite make it there. Another movie? Probably... The movie was quite good, although it did drag in a few spots. It's a dark, slow-burning drama that does finally get to a boiling point. You just have to be patient and wait for it.If Phoenix doesn't get an Oscar nomination, I will be very surprised. Is he as remarkable or rememberable as Heath Ledger? Not quite. And you have to compare apples to apples. The two are portraying the same exact character in the same exact way. Yes, Heath did it better. But not a lot better. Ledger also had a more developed character to work with. Phoenix's character is just getting started at the end of the movie. Can't wait for the next one."
4808,"The directing, score, cinematography, and acting was phenomenal in this movie, while I don't think it's the best movie ever made it definitely deserves its praise as it will go down as a classic."
4809,"I' am not going to do a review, please take my advice and enjoy the movie."
4810,"The whole movie you feel feelings, is a movie that you connect from the beginning. Before watching the movie, I read many headlines that read ""A movie that incites hate."" However, the real reason is a reflection of the burlesque society of which many of us have taken part."
4811,I went into this film with expectations for what I wanted to see from Joker and I was NOT disappointed! Joaquin Phoenix took my breath away with his portrayal of Joker. I was absolutely riveted watching his descent into darkness. Heath Ledger would be proud to see how Joaquin Phoenix hit the bar that was set with Ledger's performance and made this character his own.
4812,"Good movie, it is a dramatic take on the joker and by no means an action flick. It's an almost indie, Sundance-type character study really, so watch it with that expectation and focus. It gives some nods to Batman and that world, but really isn't about Gotham or the dark knight. It really is an immature archcriminal/Joker (IMO) in his earlier days. It shows his sadness and vulnerability more than his anger and badass swagger (though it does that toward the end). It made me want to binge Batman Begins then The Dark Knight immediately!The first half of this movie is about a really mentally ill and out of touch human (vs super-villain); he is so awkward and sad. I do wish they made him a little more relatable, he was already so emotionally (and neurologically, I think) messed up throughout the movie that it was hard to identify with him for the most part. I did, being someone who has had depression, identify with the intense loneliness, sadness and detachment Pheonix did a spectacular job (as always!) portraying. However, I think found it hard to digest his odd combo of schizoid and autistic traits. Overall I really enjoyed the film and will and must watch it at least once more, now with the mindset of it being a dramatic film. It's a dramatic film about a deranged man who snaps and adopts an alter-ego, in an understandable way."
4813,"Walking into this film I didn't know much about the story or the actor, I had hear great things about Joaquin Phoenix and his movies but I had never experienced it. I was told countless times there would be incredible amounts of violence and when I walked in he barely killed or hurt anyone. Although you only see five deaths six are implied, but the most damage was to himself and the psychological doing the world had done to him. I had felt a deep sorrow for Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) because it shows society failing as a unit. The was no one helped him, he felt alone and trapped, doctors were failing, his mother was crazy, and no one bothered to care. Joker had started a revolution without saying a word. As a viewer we are told not to feel remorse or sympathy for any villain because it is their choosing this was not the case, no wonder a man went insane. The way Joaquin Phoenix presented himself was incredible 10/10. The story line really showed the darkness of the world and the crazy 10/10. This movies was incredible I recommend it to anyone and everyone. A good movie for me gives me a connection and I felt this throughout the entire film."
4814,"I was very overhyped when i went to the cinema and this film did not dissapoint. Acting = De Niro and Joaquin were mezmerizing. Screenplay and cinematography = Nothing bad to say there was even nods to the comics and The Dark Knight if you look closely. Soundtrack = Excellent.
Heard a lot of backlash for the violence of the movie, these news outlets ever seen John Wick jesus christ the violence was very tame compared to that.
I did not see a white man losing his mind just for the fun of it i just saw a very positive man whose life fell completely apart in a week causing him to snap. Great study about what happens when the government dosen't care about their mentally ill citizens.
Everything was good i loved it but not the absolute masterpiece that a lot of people think it is but still a damn good movie. I give a 10 to absolute masterpieces like goodfellas or the godfather and this movie was a tiny bit under those so i give a damn strong 9."
4815,"Joker Review:Joker takes place in Gotham City, where mentally-troubled comedian Arthur Fleck embarks on a downward-spiral of social revolution and bloody crime. This path brings him face-to-face with his alter-ego. Who wasn't excited for this? I mean the only thing I was most nervous for was the comparison to The Dark Knight. I love that film and I just wanted something not copying Heath Ledger. These are two different films so it's hard to compare and I won't. The one thing I can say is Joker is amazing and so is The Dark Knight. The mixture of a great storyline and riveting performance by Joaquin Phoenix is what makes this film memorable for me at least. Along with great cinematography and a haunting score. The main thing I'd love to talk about is Joaquin Phoenix. Give that man an Oscar! Every time he was on the screen I couldn't look away. He puts his own new style to the character which I love. For example his laugh. He's not copying the classic laugh that everyone knows. There's a new way of incorporating it in where it feels more real and painful to watch, but in a good way. It's definitely the darkest version of the character that we've seen on screen and that's great. It's raw and real. I could feel for him the entire film, which is hard when the main character is a villain. The approach and descent into chaos we see really aids in our attitudes towards him. Some people, if they really don't like dark material at all, may have trouble with it. Like I said the story is dark but it's a good drama. I don't want to consider it a thriller because it feels too real to me. The one thing I think the story needed was a little bit less inspiration from some films like Taxi Driver. It's a good story but it really paralleled to other stories. I just wanted a little bit more originality, not saying it's not entirely though. One of my favorite stories within it was the relationship with Zazie Beetz's character and Joaquin Phoenix. I felt like it was unnecessary and then a twist happens which I just absolutely loved. I don't know why but it just made me love Arthur so much more. The story is accompanied with a haunting score by Hildur Guðnadóttir, who just won an Emmy for another great score for Chernobyl. It wasn't out there and more subtle which made scenes more unnerving sometimes. It slowly would build and be there. This may sound strange and many don't pay attention to this but I really loved the sound design for this. It was one of the main things I noticed throughout and as the story got more chaotic and scenes broke out into disarray it sounded brilliant to me. I can't explain it. One thing with the chaos is that it just reminder me so much of Darren Aronofsky's mother!. It's a very strange film with lots to say and an unpopular opinion: I think mother! is a perfect film. Anyway those whole scenes are anxiety enduring which is good. The cinematography by Lawrence Sher captures everything so well. I could see both the score and cinematography getting nominations the next Academy Awards. I really don't want to spoil anything and leave you to watch it for yourself. I think this is a brilliant film and will someday become a classic.My Grade: A-"
4816,"LOVE the theme of this movie - mental illness, with a side of ""kill the rich."" The violence might be a little hard for some to watch, but it's only a few scenes and the violence is pretty brief.Seriously, just give Juaquin ALL THE AWARDS - what an amazing performance. Interesting that the critics are 50/50 on this and the actual audience is loving it."
4817,"As a frequent movie goer and fellow performer I would just like to say first off I am thoroughly impressed. The entirety of this film was extremely depressing. Any sliver of happiness that Arthur gets, seems to just get extracted viciously out of his life. You watch his slow decent into madness and you're clenching onto your seat to see what he might do next; whether that is killing ruthlessly, or creating fake relationships in his twisted mind. Joaquin Phoenix depicts the perfect battle between good and evil with his constant struggle between happiness and sadness. In the end I was honestly routing for the joker because of the pain manifested through his whole life. This movie made me laugh, cry, and made me see things differently about society. Everyone is a little mad. 10/10"
4818,"Walking into this film I didn't know much about the story or the actor, I had hear great things about Joaquin Phoenix and his movies but I had never experienced it. I was told countless times there would be incredible amounts of violence and when I walked in he barely killed or hurt anyone. Although you only see five deaths six are implied, but the most damage was to himself and the psychological doing the world had done to him. I had felt a deep sorrow for Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) because it shows society failing as a unit. The was no one helped him, he felt alone and trapped, doctors were failing, his mother was crazy, and no one bothered to care. Joker had started a revolution without saying a word. As a viewer we are told not to feel remorse or sympathy for any villain because it is their choosing this was not the case, no wonder a man went insane. The way Joaquin Phoenix presented himself was incredible 10/10. The story line really showed the darkness of the world and the crazy 10/10. This movies was incredible I recommend it to anyone and everyone. A good movie for me gives me a connection and I felt this throughout the entire film."
4819,"Despite all the bad press the left leaning political left gave this movie ( I used to lean left( now neutral)... This movie was simply stunning! Joaquin Phoenix puts blood and sweat into this role. The director crafts the movie like a piece of fine art. Despite the triumph of Endgame earlier in the year, in comparison,Endgame seemed like a wonderful day at a themepark whereas Joker was deeply impactful, thought-provoking and stunningly masterful.If the paid media isn't careful by reviewing entertainment according to poltical leanings instead of reviewing movies at thier own merit ,they will render themselves irrelevant. This movie put a stamp as memorable as Heath Ledgers take, of Batman's arch nemesis."
4820,"As one of the better known comic book character villains, this film makes for an interesting alternate of an origin story compared to the multitudes of others about the Joker. Phoenix commits to the role playing a realistic mentally ill/traumatized socially isolated character. Inevitably the conclusion is known from the start, ergo becoming the Joker, but the journey was interesting nevertheless."
4821,"Just saw it after reading mixed reviews. I will say that this was an outstanding back story, set in a real life type scenario. Not a very comic book feel, but still seemed to hold truths with the Batman storyline. I'm no Batman expert, but I say the performance was just how it was supposed to be and this movie provided some very cool scenes with an interesting music score. Great ""How he came to be""
It's good and worth the money to see in the theater."
4822,"We could be looking at a second best actor award for a Joker actor.
It's not really an enjoyable movie to watch, certainly not fun, but it's very emotional and very well done. The acting, directing, and writing was excellent."
4823,"Really a masterpiece especially if you look at it beyond the surface level. It is beautifully disturbing and violent, and Joaquin put on a spectacular performance in this version of Joker. Definitely will be winning awards."
4824,"There are parts of this movie that are actually uncomfortable to watch and it's unflinching reality is what makes it so special. It is the performance of Pheonix's career and the highest achievement by Phillips to date. It also happens to be my personal favourite thing done with the Batman mythos since Ledger's Joker. I hope Warner Bros. has the balls to keep allowing Phillips to continue making movies in this universe. Of course, the ending does complicate things."
4825,This movie is probably the best movie i have ever seen. everything was perfect. a solid 10. had to creator an account just to give this movie a 10
4826,Possibly the best movie I've seen. A perfect representation of how you'd imagine a character such as the joker to be imagined on the big screen. Also deals with a lot of real world issues and leaves you thinking of how things are. I've seen this movie in theatres two times in theatres and was left with the same feelings both times. Joaquin Phoenix did a truly magnificent job.
4827,"Far from a superhero flick,the name of the Joker managed to bring again to the cinema theaters all kinds of people,showing the effect good cinema can have as a collective experience.Good cinema appeals to everyone,not only cinephiles and Phillip's Joker is the proof.A film with no effects,no thriller elements,of not more than one character,with no car chases,no superhero costumes manages to be just mesmerising for a mere 2 hours.That is mainly due to Joaquin Phoenix.Cinematography is beautiful just as the direction,but the film lives through Phoenix who is haunting.A film that maybe shows that we as an audience might had been getting it wrong all along just as the studios might had miscalculated what we really like in the first place.Just like references as Taxi Driver were creating havoc upon their release,maybe the Joker will bring again the cinema to a new golden era,giving blockbusters a new different meaning.As for the social commentary,I will not comment on the nonsense.I will just say that what the film is accused for couldn't be further from the truth.There is a message.That's that we should think again of all the times we turned our back to people in need,all the times we laughed at them and all the times we didnt give a helping hand when they were so desperately trying to reach out.Maybe Joker can make us better,only for a while.I'm just stunned."
4828,"Echoes of Hitchcock Keystone Cops, Fritz Lang, Chaplin.......
Joker is about the real world right now in Western societies.
It's a very pessimistic view but isn't the present world very pessimistic?
We have global warming climate change promising extinction point-of-no-return within ten years. We have nuclear holocaust more possible than ever before.
We have the collapse of antibiotics.
We have the Technological Revolution disruption upon us.
We have democracy itself disappearing everywhere, especially in the USA.
We have real life Jokers as US president, UK Prime Minister, and other dictators throughout Europe and the world. China will become the major power on the planet very soon and that spells the end of democracy. But no people likes or wants democracy anyway, so what's the problem? No one remembers the past. History is dead. President Mitterrand said in his last speech to Europe before he died trying to remind the world that ""Nationalism causes war!"" But the world has totally forgotten and abandoned that idea because we have pure Nationalism in the USA and Europe with the UK leading with Brexit.
Nationalism causes War.
Brexit is pure Nationalism because every single reason for voting Leave is Nationalism.
Therefore, Brexit causes war!
What do these existential threats have to do with a silly film called ""Joker""?
Well, just about everything. The frustration of Arthur results in Psychosis and violence. USA gun laws and the NRA play a central core part in Joker. He performs every bad guy Joker act with a ""Saturday Night Special"", a 38 hand gun. That gun escalates the violence. He's a nihilist at the point of the gun. The music specifically weaves itself into the film/ Joker actually mouths the words of the soundtrack music at one point which is shocking. This is an extremely realistic film almost documentary-style. The reality of the environment is a main character in much the same way as the fog is the main character in Bleak House by Charles Dickens. Joachim Phoenix is as good as any Best Actor award. The editing also shines. The director is a master as are the writers. The supporting cast are wonderful and great, all award-winners! The cinematography is close to perfect and the styling is spot on with careful attention to detail. There is little to fault with this film other than the subject matter, which is the real world which is very much at fault! Joker is a classic masterpiece and takes its place in cinema and world history. It's up there with Citizen Kane. It's as destructive as hundreds of millions of Hiroshima/Nagasaki atom bombs. Trump is as bad as the Joker only Trump doesn't have the compassion and empathy that the Joker has. Joker will inspire psychologists and psychiatrists to study it. Politicians should study it but won't because they, like the business person are triadic personalities (Narcissist/Psychopath?Machiavellian). Fear and Greed is the business person's Credo. The supreme God of sapiens is money and the corruption of Western democracy and liberalism is complete. One can think too much and too deeply about the issues that Joker touches upon. In spite of this dark film it is magical because it is immensely entertaining. Work that one out...."
4829,"I got to see this movie mid-day with my girl and we were curious how Joaquin Phoenix would deliver such a pivotal role, and he didnt disappoint. The director won our vote hands downs, best movie of the year."
4830,"This is more of a psychological movie than a comic book movie, it's so deep it may bore you. This movie does not romanticize violence or killing but rather, it reminds us why we should always be kind and have empathy to other people. Why we should never be the reason a good person would resort to violence and madness.Rating: 10/10 ✨You should see how Joaquin Phoenix transform from Arthur to being the Joker to becoming a symbol."
4831,"So good in so many different ways!! This movie tells us about someone who can't fit in, it's a critic to society who can't accept the ones that are different, this is a very important subject on the 21st century! But let's talk about the important part in here: Phoenix's performance! MEMORABLE that's all I can say, if this guy doesn't win as Oscar for this one, I don't know who will! Such an incredible and different movie should and probably will have a huge recognition! Thanks Todd Phillips for this huge MASTERPIECE!"
4832,This film is a wonderful gripping intense experience and you just have to see it I can't do it justice.
4833,It was very well written and dives deep into the psychological aspect of how a killer is formed in the real world. It is very harrowing as well and made me feel some sympathy for the Joker as well. The movie also speaks to the awful realities of society and how they can change a person. Joaquin Phoenix did a great job playing this role and captured the character very well.
4834,"A movie of a lifetime!
Great in every aspect.
This is the kind of art we don't normally dare to enjoy.
Joaquin Phoenix shows us a society toxic enough to bring a clown all the way up to a King of chaos.
Its a movie about lack of love, empathy, humanism, and understanding.
Its a trip to the other side of madness."
4835,Easily one of (if not) the best movie of the decade !
4836,"In the past, almost every movie taught us to support character who was kind and who everybody loved. The other one who killed people and made something bad, oh, screw him, he should be punished, no one cared about evil character. But wait, don't we remember that life doesn't work this way? There is no sharp line between dark and bright side, there is no absolutely bad and absolutely good in people. And that 'kind guy' is the worst one is someone's story.Joaquin's joker is the brilliant example of it. Despite from other jokers, this one is real. He lives in every person who is permanent victim of society, bulling and indifference. This joker shows us the blindness of ours. Yes we support the cowards like Thomas wayne and don't think maybe how many lives we have ruined with our rudeness and injustice.Everyone who joker killed deserved it.The only reason of my 9 is the last scene. It has no meaning, movie should end with making a bloody smile on face. The glory of Joker and the Defeat of blind, stupid, arrogant and indifferent bustards.What about Joaquin, he makes me wordless!!!"
4837,"For those that aren't aware ... this is not a big comic book action film CGI fest... enjoy the story you are being told, the emotions are there.
As a stand alone film, it's brilliant, for those that want references to you know who, it's has slim pickings and that's how it should be, this story is not about him. I did want a little more madness in regards to Joker kicking off but I think that's because of the hype the fainthearted have created. I've read people feeling uncomfortable and it's so violent. I think there's two moments of violence, that were acted out very well. You get pulled in, waiting to see where the story will take you.
It's a very good portrayal as origin for the Joker, great acting and story line. You can end up with a number of interpretations to this movie. If you already know background and interpretations of Jokers origin, be it comics, animated, big screen previous, you will enjoy this for sure."
4838,"Brilliant movie, Joaquin Phoenix did and outstanding job in his leading role and should be nominated for best actor for it."
4839,"Haven't watched a movie since The Jungle Book. Which I enjoyed because it's a great story. Today I watched Joker. This is a true movie without the fantastic unbelievable BS hero stuff. There's no heroes here. Just a egoistic society void of god and angels. Virtue is at a bargain price if it exists at all. One leaves this movie wanting to deny three times that they belong to this species. The performance is worth twice the admission. It may be another 5 years before the next movie I go out to see, but I sure make it the good ones."
4840,What a performance👏🏻 I've enjoyed every single second of it!
4841,The best back story for you will ever see for Joker. Full of deep scenes and thoughts
4842,"Todd Philips, (director best known for the saga ""Hangover in Las Vegas"") seems to want to return to its origins, when his first opera, (""Hated"", 1994 work based on the ill-fated outsider GG Allin) dazzled half the world.After almost 20 years bursting lockers with works of doubtful taste, Todd Philips decided it was time to recover and reinvent the myth once again: Joker.The basic problem is that after the amazing interpretation and subsequent death of Heath Ledger, the icon was transformed into myth and myths are impossible to ""reinvent"" unless you have a brilliant script and find an actor insane and magnetic enough to pick up the witness at Ledger: Joaquin Phoenix.Phoenix has achieved what seemed impossible: to make us forget, for a second, the great Heath Ledger to imbue his own dose of madness ... The most bitter fans of the bat will love the interpretation of Phoenix by the amazing and realistic interpretation of an ""entity ""plunged into the most absolute devastation, channeler of chaos, anger and evil that happens to our world. His genesis, his smile give us back the cognitive dissonance between the real and the impossible: a set of mirrors that point directly to the viewer as the maker of the king of chaos, and it is in that same Bertoltbrechtian game, where we become partners of the vehement viscerality of an interpretation and drama that implode and give birth to chaos in the form of Joker.Throughout the history of cinema there have been dazzling interpretations; What Phoenix has achieved will blind us in a breath of heartbreaking darkness without knowing very well whether to laugh or cry.Work of instant worship."
4843,What a performance. What a movie.Absolutely mind blowing. 10/10. And I am not a comic book/Batman fan at all. I just love Phoenix. This is one of the best films he has ever done.
4844,"ONE OF THE GREATEST FILMS OF ALL TIME!
ONE OF THE GREATEST ACTING PERFORMANCES OF ALL TIME!
THIS FILM SIMPLY CANNOT BE MISSED"
4845,"I don't really review movies much but ... after leaving the theater on this one, there is just a really heavy cloud on my head. This movie is a 9.3/10.I can't recall any time seeing a movie and result in an actual headache. With those being said, this movie is good. It's tragic. It's dark. And it's quite unpredictable.Not everyone is gonna like this type of movie. It's a slow-burn. A deep character study where how a man being put in a tragic life and constantly being pushed to his limit. Yeah sure, it's just a comic-book character but hey, this movie is really beautifully and carefully crafted.There are so many Joker moments in the movie. Joaquin Phoenix is just truly a star of my time. He went for it.I can't really think of a scene where Joaquin isn't in it.All in all, it is just a masterpiece."
4846,"Those who didn't vote it 10/10
I hope you go to hell"
4847,It's brilliant 10 out of 10 must watch best movie in a long time ture story telling.
4848,"I have no words, It's just been a while since I watched such a quality movie."
4849,There's a reason why this is 9 out of 10 on here.. it's a real masterpiece. Loved it!
4850,"Pure art. Makes you question your morality, life view, and everything that art needs to shake in your soul. I'm amazed. Speechless."
4851,"Joaquin Phoenix delivers a perfect representation of the clown prince of crime in this absolutely phenomenal film. Todd Phillips did an excellent job in the writing and direction of the film and the sound track is also one of the best I've seen for a long time. This is by far my favourite movie of all time and I do think it will age well despite the controversy over its depictions of violence which help demonstrate the capabilities of such a twisted character. I would certainly suggest this film even if you are not a comic movie fan since this really departs from the flashy antics we are used to and narrows in on the nitty, gritty details of such an infamous character, giving us a realistic, in depth study on a mentally ill person."
4852,"What a great movie ""Joker"" is..It reminds me of ""Taxi Driver"" in a way and guess who the co-star is? ""Robert De Niro""...And I'm sure all the President Trump fans will love Joker's appearance on Robert's talk show and what happens to Robert De Niro...This was a very enjoyable 2 hours taking place in Gotham City exploring the psychological breakdown of a man who has a hidden past and who was bullied and finally gets revenge on the corporate snobs that run the city...I would not be surprised if it takes the Oscar for Best Movie either!!!Must see Movie of the year!!!"
4853,I couldn't take my eyes off Joker. A virtuoso performance from Joaquin Phoenix.
4854,What can i say! Just Brilliant! Go and see it!!! We just came out of the premier in zurich and we are speachless...
4855,"Without giving anything away if this doesn't win at least 2 Oscars (Best actor, Best cinematography) I'll be surprised. The perfomances and sets are totally engrossing as you join Arthur Fleck on his descent into discovery of who he is and also how he influences certain events in the DC universe. I'd love to watch it again tomorrow it was that good, and I haven't felt that way about a film since Blade Runner & BR 2049."
4856,Just coming back from cinema. I have been so impressed by this movie.
4857,"This movie is one of the greatest movies ever made. Everything about the movie is fantastic. The acting, the plot, the twists, the music, you name it... But the most important thing, the ending, is something Spectacular!In the final scene when Arthur is speaking with his psychiatrist he is in a mental asylum and his hair and beard are GREY, a sign of this being about 15-30 years later. When speaking with his psychiatrist, Arthur suddenly starts to laugh, but only this time, his laugh is very different from the laugh throughout the movie. This laugh seems a lot more ""genuine"". Arthur is having a flashback to the time when he was free. Then the psychiatrist asks him, what is so funny? Arthur then gets a new flashback, this time, of Bruce Wayne standing beside his dead parents during the riot caused by the joker. Then Arthur says ""You wouln't get the joke"". Since Arthur now has grey hair, this is some years later. During these, lets say, 20 years, Bruce Wayne has become Batman and got his revenge on the joker, who was the reason for his parents' death. Arthur finds this funny because of the irony. Arthur starting a riot, leading to the death of Bruce's parents, Bruce coming back, 20 years later, and locking Arthur inside the asylum. Arthur doesn't only find this funny, he also gets very angry and upset, which is why he kills his psychiatrist in the end. He is angry that his actions fired back at him and caused him to be locked up in a mental asylum for the rest of his life.The joke all along, and the reason for Arthur calling his life ""a comedy"", is that HE CREATED the BATMAN.Thank you."
4858,Movie and performance of the year. No need to say anymore. Sit back and relax and try and smile 😀
4859,Absolutely great performance. Phoenix owns this role. The character development is amazing.
4860,Saddistic sinister dark performance of Phoenix is simply disturbingly arousingly brilliant & executed with a nail perfectly straight into the minds of the audiences.
4861,"It's dark, gritty, intense and utterly beautiful.
Never seen a cinema like this in a recent time, Joaquin Phoenix is just turned the comic Joker into reality, just giving him the Oscar wouldn't be enough to justify his tremendous acting.
It's a life time experience, how beautifully it's been crafted. I can't stop talking about this and can't come out what I've just experienced.
One of my best movie of all time, still need some time regain consciousness, Flawless acting and constant goosebumps.Ohhh man ❤ #GodofActing #Joker #DC"
4862,This movie blew me away. I walking in with massive expectations and walked out feeling they had all been destroyed. This movie is brilliant go and see it and digest it's beauty!
4863,Movie is awesome as it develops character of Joker and downward spiral because of society.
4864,"Even though I knew about this film I never got that excited about it beforehand. That being said, I did end up seeing this at the opening weekend so maybe still a but of a fanboy!What can I say more than, at the end of the film I wanted to clap and shout about what an amazing film it was. Oscar worthy Joaquin, DeNeiro popping up in any film is a bonus. Cinematic gold, no CGI, no epic settings, no cast of millions...just an amazing story well told and acted!If you only see one film this year, than see this one."
4865,"If I were to use one word to describe this film, it would be uncomfortable. This is great, since it's clear this is exactly what this film feels like it's trying to do. That said, the soundtrack was great, and fit the tone really well, all performances hit the bar for me. That said, it's still not a perfect film. For one, I think the film should have ended in the streets during the scene on the police car instead of in the prison, leaving the impression that the joker os free. Also, if the makeup of the joker could change over time to look more and more like Heath Ledger. I guess this kinda happened when he spread the blood across his cheeks, but this could have had a lot more weight to it if his makeup changed over time with the character. Overall, highly recommended."
4866,"Phoenix does justice to the Joker with his every bit of emotion, movement, and delivery of dialogues - hands down an amazing performance. Arthur's journey will engross the viewer, pushing them to encounter a devastating mix of emotions."
4867,"These last dialogues from the film predicted what many critics and viewers will be faced with. Upon reading several reviews and listening to the constroversy surrounding this movie, I was somewhat skeptical that may be this movie just pushed the right hot buttons ideologically/politically, and that would be it, nothing more. But not only Joker mirrored the real life themes of mental health, poverty and elitism, but also managed to be a solid origin movie of a comic book villain. This movie neither inspires violence or glorifies incel like behavior as media is falsely suggesting, it puts the main character in the spot light from the beginning on how mentally unstable and unsettling his behavior is. I don't think this movie even sympathize with the joker to even make his rationals (if there are any) or actions justifiable, but instead it only presents a bleak picture of society where such people are ticking timebomb, and without the help they need, they are destined to have a similar (but not as theatrical as Joker's) fate. This movie is sometimes disturbing in it's plot points, and Jeaquin Phoenix's performance is crazy good and very unsettling, even in the society that is represented, but to say either this is a movie about a sane actor in an insane world or a sane character in an insane world would be injustice. This movie is about the insanity coming it terms with it, and realizing the world is just as insane. The Joke is truly on us, and only reason we are laughing because we are in constant pain just like the Joker."
4868,"Joaquin Phoenix, point pertama langsung ke aktornya, ini seperti maha karya, saya bahkan tidak merasa rugi mengeluarkan uang untuk film ini, bahkan ini sudah murah untuk kelas pemeran sepertinya.Kedua saya sangat waw melihat aktingnya memerankan Arthur Fleck yang sangat keren, penjiwaan yang sangat kena, emosional dan juga akting yang sangat profesional.Close up acting, raut wajah, mata, gerak tubuh semuanya di mainkan dengan sangat profesional dan sangat sempurna.Saya beri 9 dari 10, dan bintang 1 nya adalah perannya sebagai Joker.
Saya rasa dia belum all out memerankan Joker, timeline-nya sebagai Joker saat dia dengan make up Joker masih kurang menurut saya. Saya ingin melihatnya lagi sebagai Joker.SPOILER
Biarpun saya merasa kurang dengan perannya, tapi Scene yang paling saya suka adalah saat dia berbicara dengan Murray itu sangat menunjukannya bagaiman Joker dengan Mental Disorder yang terkontrol.Thanks."
4869,"Just loved it. I haven't seen anything like this before. Amazing set, great acting and the best and scary portrayal of the joker. 👍"
4870,"I could write down a testament, but why?
What a movie and a performance, so long it has been without exit a session feeling like this.
It's harsh, raw, hard and not easy on you...
At the end you think to yourself, how in hell a movie with not that much action could keep my heart beating loudly in so many moments.
What a masterpiece, respect!
Joaquim Phoenix, you are a Legend!"
4871,Just amazing piece of Cinema. Brilliant from start to finish. Haven't seen character building like this in a long long time. Well done Todd Phillips & Joaquin Phoenix
4872,"Fantastic! amazing! phenomenal! and ...
joaquin phoenix shining in this movie , a perfect gotham and a perfect acting team!
and now i think to myself : who is the best?
1)joaquin phoenix
2)heath ledger"
4873,"The quality of this performance cannot be oversold. It's astonishing how good a job Phoenix did. Cinematography excellent also.
Going back to see it again in the theatre... it's THAT good."
4874,"This movie is masterpiece! It something I can enjoy couple times in my life! This is first time the joker go non violent to realistic violence! It very brutal, unsettling, very dark and one of best of Joaquin Phoenix performance as the Joker. I'm so happy that they made Joker that is great like Dark Knight But even DARKER!10/10"
4875,A really magnificent piece of art with an incredible and deep scenes and thoughts. You won't see a better scenario for Joker than this one.
4876,In a beautiful character study of a man that society has neglected. Great film. Masterful visual work in this production with an equally lovely and terrifying score that complements Joaquin Phoenix's character development. Fan theories abound. A definite must see!
4877,"Didn't go with high expectations and was literally impressed by the feelings that this movie shows. Depending on the person, some may feel depressed after this movie or some could feel for the Joker and what is happening in the world. Recommend this movie to everyone to see."
4878,This is a great opportunity for me to be able to help you with the best of best of the best and
4879,"A movie about a man suffering death by a thousand cuts.
Frankly it won't be something i will be rewatching often but that isn't the type of movie you get here. You get an amazing first watch, with an amazing story.
Joaquin Phoenix does an outstanding job."
4880,"Before I saw the movie I saw the bad reviews by self-proclaimed movie critics but i still wanted to give it a shot and I am so glad that I did. The narrative has great depth as well as the actors, especially Joaquin Phoenix. The music and sceneries fit so well that it catapults you right into the time and place. There's so much I could say about this movie but I don't wanna spoil anything.This movie has once again proven how important it is to find things out for yourself and not listen to others, especially not critics who's job is to create awareness for their publication. I truly hope Joker will continue with this cast and formula.10/10 for Joker."
4881,Was an exceptional piece that portrayed what the result of a society beating a man down to the point of no return; The clown prince of crime.
4882,"From Phoenix's brilliant performance to the story itself, this movie delivers an astonishing dark origin tale of one of the most infamous villains in comic book history. It will make you laugh, perhaps cry, feel sorry and pain, anger and accomplishment as it is one of the BEST movies in cinema history. Personally I didn't have much expectations to avoid disappointment, but this movie succeeded in catching my attention and love from beginning to end. I watched it the day it came out and I'm still amazed by how it touched me. Heath is surely proud of Phoenix's role watching from up there. Go and watch this every penny worthy movie, it's pure art."
4883,How can we start from the very beginning I was locked in hooked and eyes stuck to the screen shivers down my spine and hairs raising on my arms and legs what a sensational performance from phoenix the manor of his approach attention to detail was to the T the story line was so focused and crisp just a outstanding film with not a single error this will be added to my film collection and if heath ledger could see this he would be proud.
4884,"If you expect a movie which focusses on action than this might not be for you... if you want a very clear view on how a mentally stressed and by society totally disgarded man becomes a total psycho you should totally see this movie. When Fleck stops getting the help he clearly needs and everything he knew and ""loved"" is a total lie and killed some people in the proces he plans to makes one final plan to show the world his distress... killing himself on national television; however... when he gets interrupted by the host he choses for an other option which makes his transformation to ""Joker"" complete. The film is disturbingly showing (in a very good way imo) how the (higher) society itself is partially responsible for the creation of psychopaths like Fleck and therefore the violence that occurs is reviewed by many as too harshly while a lot of other movies that are drenched with it come away with it. The violence is not that hard but because it is placed on exactly the right places it creates the shivers that the makers wants us to get. It is a movie that should get a lot of oscars especially for Joaquin who did a more than excellent job portraying the prince of darkness."
4885,"I still haven't decided how to rate the film, I need some time to think, maybe rewatch the movie several times.However, I'm sure how to rate Joaquin Phoenix's acting: it's 10/10, exceptional performance, the best that I've seen this year."
4886,"This move is hear to stay.
Timeless movie, great in every way."
4887,"This is just amazing go watch it. The acting is the best thing in this movie, and I love the dances he does they remind me of Tobey Maguire in SpiderMan 3"
4888,"Finally, a movie which is worth writing a review for. Not a regular action movie with a villian-type of main role. It is an astonishing, stylish and very dark story of a man becoming the Joker. The environment, the music, the actors, everything just felt as a unity. Bravo!"
4889,"Don't read any reviews, all of the critics just want to be clever about this movie and then fail. This is a masterpiece. One you don't get to see too often these days. See it for yourself."
4890,"From start to finish this movie gripped me, the direction, pace, acting, production, costumes, dialogue.... done to PER-FLECK-TION!! (See what I done there)Brutal yet honest this depiction of the Joker has left me wondering ""if this was by far the best portrayal of the joker, who could possibly do better?"" - well I asked the same thing with Heath Ledger's Joker and it looks like I have my final answer. This was deep and it felt like there was an underlining message about mental health issues and our governments blind eye turning that leads to the final result.This film is worthy of an Oscar in all departments especially for Joaquin Phoenix. Please dont take my word for it, go and see this movie as soon as. I feel a renewed faith in DC IF they go along a similar path as they have with this.How have some critics played this movie down so much is beyond me!"
4891,Hands down film of the year... Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely mesmerising as the clown prince of crime.
4892,"I shall keep this brief... as a suffer of a mental illness, some of the scenes were very difficult to watch, but the acting and direction of the movie were of such high quality, it must be seen.This will be considered a modern great, and the depiction of The Joker will have shrinks coming out of every orifice.Go see it before you hear too much!"
4893,Oscar worthy in all categories. Better than dark knight.
4894,"Certainly there's an huge hype around the movie, and certainly this is not a movie for the general DC/Marvel audience.
But don't get me wrong, I bow towards the bold and risk-taking of bringing such a movie under such a notorious and well-known character.Although, I doubt if it wasn't about joker, it would been so widespread.This is the kind of movie that leaves you thinking after you watched it, or makes you discuss with your friends/online for hours. Not only about its ending and what it meant, but how toxic and indifferent humans may be to one another, the respect you have towards others, how fragile an human mind can be, and finally, the monsters we may help to create.It's a psychologic, depressive and sad movie but also an eye-opener.
And i tend to believe that was the whole point. To bring a message to the world under a very known character that you know will attract a bigger audience.Sad for those 'professional' critics who are concerned about the violent content (psychological/physical) when kids can get to any sorts of content on the internet.
This is one small part of our world, and better to have them aware than to try and hide human imperfections."
4895,"Joker will draw you into his madness and sociopathy that will make you question everything. Todd and Joaquin bring us a masterpiece of human nature and how person is shaped by events that are happening to them.Joker is a dramatic piece that will be understood by regular people and seen in grey areas and not only black and white. It's about human tortures and dramatic events that happen all around us but we pretend like everything is fine. Joker dives deep into dark teritories and pushes boundaries with extreme violence but shows us why is everything happening and how our protagonist is dealing with information given to him. Arthur Fleck is a disturbed man which is evident from beginning but as story goes you find to learn more about him and how he is only trying to find its way in the crazy world.There are multiple possibilites for someone if they pursue them, they might not be the best but Arthur chooses one that he feels most comfortable with and his sense of comedy and darkness is unique but who are we to put his hopes and dreams down. Joaquin's commitmend to role is extraordinary, he pushes boundaries with his dedication for characters place and feelings. It is absolutely magnificent to watch him present us Arthur in all his colors and shades as he is mesmerasing, deceving and twisted.Todd moving from his regular comedy type movies and going full drama, choosing Joker (DC comics based character) and putting him in real world with real people insted of fictional universe is praise worth and him developing such a intriguing story that will feel like you are watching some regular drama inspired by time and day we live in. We live in sick and hard times but we choose to fight and overcome everything but there will always be other ones that are not capable of doing it and it will make them mad. Insted seeing this movie as movie that can make people do bad things it should make them see that bad things are not acceptable and how they make things dark and chaotic. and will always end in personal destruction.Directing and writing of Joker is marvellous from every point, it may not be the smart as some movies but it is captivating and makes you wonder all the time how things are going to happen and how they might have happened. Todd may have started his new path into greater film making and it will be interesting to see what he has to offer in the upcoming years.Dark, twisted and magnificent are the best words to describe the movie. 10/10"
4896,The best movie 10000000 like master amazing actor and director and amazing music 💯💯💯💯
4897,"It's a prominent movie that describe simply how Arthre Flick turned to The Joker but in a destinctive way
It's highly recommended 💙"
4898,"If you want an origin story from the DC world, then you have to see this film. It is not an action packed adventure like batman, but a story of a man who lives in a world that is unjust, unforgiving and toxic.
The music score throughout helps the intensity of the story and Mr Phoenix's portrayal and character development really is astounding.
Will have to watch it again to get my head around the storyline some more."
4899,Amazing movie and the interpretation of Joaquin is absolutely stunning. 10/10
4900,"It's not the masterpiece like all the people saying, I was little bit disappointed because it's not upto the hype."
4901,"This is an incredible achievement. It has the much needed depth for modern day movies and is equally gripping. The origin of Joker is as poignant as the origin of Batman himself. The seemingly unsmiling Batman who wants order does need, and indeed does depend on the equally mighty force of laughter and chaos that comes to be the Joker. The descent into disorder, the hatred of the successful, etc. is all seamless. I am truly glad that this movie held on to its darker tones as it is, after all, a dark Batman and Joker story. Order and Chaos. Bring it on. I do sincerely hope that they continue with this storyline and we see more of this intense stuff. 10/10 from me. Not 9. Not 9.9 but a full 10 out of 10."
4902,One of the best films I've seen in a long long while.I will even say... probably better than Heath Ledger's Joker.Don't believe some of the negative reviews; they're just trying to grab some attention.
4903,"I do not prefer to make a comparison to previous representations of the character.
My focus is here that this time they nailed it. This is how and adaptation and interpretation of story and character should have been."
4904,"JOKER, This is why I love acting, however if you are in a bad mood stay away from this movie. The movie is deeply confusing and dark. Touching your heart confusing your mind. Outstanding performance facial expression body language by Joaquin Phoenix the music is increidable making you stick to your chair. Who of us not wanna be a joker to Oppression and injustice. Phoenix show us how to become a joker but Heath ledger show us what joker do, so it is unfair to compare between the two legends. Wanna see it again one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen."
4905,"A masterful performance by Phoenix that protrays the Joker perfectly. The movie takes us on a journey inside the head of the Joker and we see the character evolve into the Joker as played by Ledger.The cinematography and sound work so well together, this film deserves oscars!"
4906,The character development was amazing. Heath Ledger would be proud. Please let there be more movies with Joaquin playing the Joker!
4907,"This was a pure genius showing of the Joker (Arthur Fleck), in a very human light. A deep betrayal of nurture rather than nature. Someone who has been abused since childhood and this abuse carries on well in to his present life. A story of insanity by the product of a society with a twisted perspective. Joaquin Pheonix's performance was perfection and well worth a few awards. A brilliant take on the character Joker and well worth a watch."
4908,"I feel scared after seeing this movie since it's so vivid. I think it's very important for a country to make sure the right for people. If one person feel desperate, he or she may be crazy. Perfect way to present this story, it deserves high grade."
4909,Simply amazing. Joaquin Phoenix did an incredible job performing.
4910,Who ever decided to cast Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker is a genius... I haven't come out of the cinema feeling so elated from a film in absolute ages. I'm booking tickets and going again asap. The best Joker by a country mile! Now THATS what you call acting.
4911,"I never knew this type of emotion can be filmed through camera until I saw joker.cant say much about it, I am literally speechless. Just watch it to believe what they have made."
4912,"People who rate low for this movie, don't appreciate the concept of how dark the Gotham city is and what acting heavy mean. On the other hand avengers end game was so mediocre in creating visual effects from previous movie and using time machine to defeat evil ( plain stupid) and yes about the rating check out people's profile who rated low for this movie, 10 on 10 for avengers and spider man home coming. Clearly 90s and 00s kids have no taste in cinemas."
4913,Phenomenal and best movie in 2019. The acting was incredible.
4914,I have never gone to the cinema twice in one week to see the same film. Coming out after watching this I felt feelings I've never felt when seeing a film before. Everything about this movie is perfect. The acting is truly phenomenal. Phoenix has really outdone himself and gave the world a truly spectacular film.
4915,This kind movie is one of a kind. I saw it yesterday in the cinema and tomorrow i will go again for the second time.
4916,Joaquin Phoenix deserves oscar thats it. One of the great movie
4917,"""Phenomenal"" is the first word that comes to mind.It's rare to see so much talent in one movie. The style of direction pulls you right in to the dark world of Gotham city. It's psychological, it's gloomy and it's crazy, oh yeah. Without spoiling anything, some events in the movie are sure to hit you hard.The music is just perfect and makes the whole film smooth and much more effective. However, the best part of the movie is the actors. Every single character in the movie is portrayed so well, you'll need to remind yourself several times that you're watching a film. You'll find yourself doing a self sanity-check after watching the movie!Ultimately, there's Joaquin Phoenix. One thing I can tell you is that he deserves all the hype and more. The acting is at the next level. In my entire life, I've never felt so painful hearing someone laugh. The laughter, the dance, makeup, behavior and the personality, you will know no better ""Joker"". Joaquin DEFINES what this film meant to be.Anything less than 10/10 will be an insult to this masterpiece. If you don't carry a hatred towards psychological movies, definitely go check it out :)"
4918,"This movie is nothing about hero..
Its about an innocent man becoming a psychopath!
And they delivered it most convincing way!
From start to finish.. You will feel what's really going on!
Kudos to the Director,cinematographer, music composer, script writer and the one who pulled of the Marvellous Acting........JOAQUIN PHOENIX!!
Hope there is a sequel following what happens after that!!"
4919,"Brilliant movie with very intriguing plot twists. The first 20 minutes were enough to judge Joaquin Phoenix who did a phenomenal job as the Joker. His body transformation, looks, laugh, dance moves all summed up to make a massive combo which took the movie to a whole new level of excellence . Overall it was a masterpiece.
Ledger would be proud!"
4920,"Deep, dark and convoluted. There aren't many film out there that can capture a character's mental state as gracefully it did"
4921,"No superheroes, no flying people, no aliens! Just a poor human with its mind, soul and body. That can be any of us, that can happen in any of the cities, that can be anyone's life. People from the shadow got their 5 minutes in this movie for all of us to see how World can be dark and miserable place. That happen when people forget to be humans and to care for each other in the first place.
This is Psycho of the 21st century."
4922,"Great performance, fantastic character-intensive movie, uncomfortable and worthy of an 8.5. A shaving below awe inspiring."
4923,There have been many movies of DC but none of them put upto the mark. Recent movies were kinda flop but this movie was a great comeback. Overall i liked this movie.
4924,"Joker is a truly sensational dive into the back story of the Joker. A twisted look into his dark descent on the road to becoming the Joker. The character development is sublime with Pheonix playing an absolutely incredible version of the joker, matching his twisted insanity with scarily accurate acting. This is the back story the Joker really needed, away from all the CGI rubbish, and in with deep and dark story telling that keeps you on the edge of your seat! I also love the way a young Bruce Wayne was introduced, leading to the excitement of a potential sequel or appearance in the next Batman movie. The ending was also very very good and depicts how he became a legend amongst Gothams darkest."
4925,"JOKER was an engaging, fascinating and intense diversion from the bravado of current 'super hero' movies from DC. A gritty, character driven piece of up close and personal filming centred around one character and his transformation into the cult villain. The Joker was very much in the 'real' world as he struggles with issues around mental health, social care budgets and the cult of celebrity. There were many poignant moments as the Joker tries to find his voice in an indifferent society.It was also a comment on the power of television and how one person can rise to represent an underlying tide of discontent in society. The music was powerful, filling the scenes with additional pressure as the character teeters on the edge of sanity and building 'Taxi Driver' like to an explosive end. The timeline was a little wayward but felt there was enough of a nod to the other Batman films to tie it in to the DC Universe. A feast on many levels."
4926,"Can't stop myself from talking about this one......#no_spoilersDark as hell, Joker takes u through the disturbing journey of Arthur Fleck, from being a clown & a wanna be stand- up comedian (with only one joke in his hand.....his life) to become THE ""JOKER""......this journey never looked unreal though, unlike that of a hulk or a spider man....as this journey was quite human, logical and beautifully graphed and captured(of course) !!!Heath Ledger from the 'Dark Knight' was my personal favourite joker till date & Joaquin Phoenix took the legacy of Heath to another level altogether.....that laugh, that dance, that sprint, that walk....uff....can't get over that !!!Talking about the other aspects of the movie....the background music was the soul of the movie, if not the psyche and the madness of joker itself,,,,,the cinematography, the supporting cast, the direction...everything thing was right on money , the movie very smartly dealt with the then situation of America (the Gotham city),,,,,the unemployment, the raising power in the hands of the rich....all it took was a stand and a voice (be it good or bad) against the established power to become the 'HERO'...which further became the reason of the rise in murders & crime in the city !!!In his small appearance, the legend Robert De Niro was exceptionally awesome, something that u would expect from him everytime u see him on the screen.....that small conversation at the end btwn joker and De Niro was cinematic beauty and looked damn organic....an absolute treat to watch !!!Don't know about the oscars, but it was once in the lifetime performance by Joaquin Phoenix....and would remain in my heart for years & in my brain for days to come,,,may be.....The best portrayal of a psycho character that i have seen...was that of Christian Bale in 'American Psycho'.....Phoenix was right up there too if not above, not only the craziness, disturbance and madness but also the physical transformation was quite commendable.!! IF HEATH HAS GIVEN HIS LIFE FOR THE JOKER THEN I WOULD SAY PHOENIX HAS GIVEN A LIFE TO THE JOKER !!My one of the favourite lines from the movie was...joker saying to himself,,,""I used to think that my life is a TRAGEDY but now i realise that it is nothing but COMEDY""....so, u can imagine how disturbing a movie could be with it's theme being 'TRAGEDY=COMEDY'...but it was not that disturbing for me as i am used to of or aware of the ongoing social-political structure of our country !!!It has got those 'Dark Knight' (arguably one of the finest superhero movie ever made) vibes...i had an emotional ride, watching small Bruce Wane (Nolan's batman) meeting Joker, getting to know the pre batman story of the Gotham city and the back story or the building-up of the 'Joker the villain' of dark night.....IT WAS QUITE NOSTALGIC FOR ME IN THAT WAY !!!If i would have maximum of 5 stars to give to this movie, i would have simply divided it by zero (0).....i write about movies all the time but this one has that 'something' that forced me to type and share my views with u guys instead of writing it in my diary.....on that note i would like to finish this review with one line....""THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE IN LAST SEVERAL YEARS THAT I SAW....& U CAN'T CAN'T CAN'T MISS IT"" !!!#JOKER_2019❤❤'ALL IT TAKES IS ONE BAD DAY'-JOKER😉😛😂"
4927,"...but not the one we need right now.Taking a page out of Nolan's iconic The Dark Knight just because of how apt it fits this Joker film. The film rattles you to your core and it's scarier than some of the latest big horror films simply because of the sheer relatability of it all.Yes, this film could very well be the prologue (quite loosely put) to the Dark Knight trilogy and yes, Joaquin Phoenix has paid a sensational homage to Heath Ledger's forever legendary role as the Joker, deftly pushing the viewers to empathize with him throughout his depressing origin story.However, we don't need another film about the Joker just less than a decade after families lost their loved ones to an actual mass murderer who gunned them down after being inspired by the Joker himself, the perp himself still able to enjoy living the rest of his life behind bars.
We just don't need a film humanizing serial killers and mass murderers. Not at a time when the US mass gun shootings are still a persistent and contentious issue."
4928,"Best movie released this year and one of the best comic book movie ever made challenged only by The Dark Knight. Absolutely amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix.He has portrayed the character so brilliantly,somehow evoking our sympathy for a psychotic homicidal clown. Todd Philips and Phoenix somehow makes us feel sad of the Joker but also makes us scared of him. The movie has an uncomfortable feel to it with amazing cinematography and a beautiful score. Every time the score starts to play you know somethings about to happen but you don't know what. The ending is amazing and somehow makes you feel satisfied but also uncomfortable that you feel that way. The movie portrays a grim but realistic world and how far a person like Arthur Fleck can be hurt before he starts to fight back.Amazing plot, amazing acting,amazing directing job and overall an amazing movie.10/10 with a cherry on top"
4929,Absolutely incredible. Joaquin phoenix and Todd Philips really outdid themselves. One of best movies out there
4930,"A rumor says that this is not joker but the owlman ( who has the ability to control people's mind) from earth 3(a reversed universe) who in comics is also the brother of batman and jokester wants to destroy him, cos the universe is reversed. the story is The story of jokester who owlman narrate to the doctor at the hospital before he kills her.. What do you think?"
4931,"A film that will live for the ages as it shows great drama, fantastic soundtrack and unbelievable acting.An Experience you shouldn't miss."
4932,"I created an account just to review this. I saw it twice in the space of 3 days. This move is truly a masterpiece, in every way - the acting, story, cinematography, music, everything comes together in a more than the sum of its parts kind of way. There's a little bit of magic here, I don't think anyone can purposely create something this good, they can try, but only sometimes does it all come together like this.The second viewing was just as good as the first. The tension was the same, it was just as disturbing, and the time still flew by just as quickly. And as someone who grew up on a steady diet of batman and joker comics, this is a perfect version of the Joker's origin, and I loved how it tied in batman's origin too, that was an inspired way to link them together.The ambiguities and layers in the film were clearer on second viewing, and even keep coming days later... besides all of the ones I've seen discussed such as weather TW is his father, or which other scenes may not have happened... we also don't actually know if Arthur already had a history of violence, nor do we know if or how much the medication is what was making him so docile and timid. His journal has much more dark stuff in than we see. He is actually quite belligerent and disconnected even in the beginning of the movie. Etc. There is a LOT going on in this movie.I could gush on for hours. It is a work of art."
4933,"Please don't listen to the people and some critics who says they the movie is promoting violence. This is an entirely wrong opinion (if you have more than one brain cell). E.g. apart from that in the Time Magazine I also found out that it also includes whitewashing, too much borrowing from Scorcese and, OMG, 'not the best acting'! All is completely untrue which the user's rating prooves. Behind quite a low metacritic score I only see that a lot of elite media regards the movie as 'not politically correct' and they are totally forgetting that so is our world that we live in. So please enjoy one of the strongest and most beautiful pieces of art in years!"
4934,Don't miss this if you are still breathing!! Beautiful direction and acting.. holding a theatre full of crowd for the entirety of this film with an amazing performance by Jacqueline Phoenix and a haunting background score.. just go watch it no matter what type of movie lover you are!!
4935,Joaquin phoenix's masterclass saved the movie otherwise the film wouldnt have lasted this long in the theatres. Despite having a slow start the movie focuses on Joker's brilliant character building but what they lacked was a better ending or a better twist.
4936,The best MOVIE I've seen in years🔥🔥I'll see it again
4937,"It has took a 100 years for cinema to be where it is now and if Joker is any insight into this era of film, it's looking good. Firstly, Joaquin's chilling and haunting portrayal of a man trying to live his life while being broken at every chance in his life and every person possible is brilliant. The exploration of mental health not only by the writer but by the leads superb slowly dying eyes, his shallow and piercing laugh and his physicality being broken down into a skeletal structure laced with skin. This performance is amazing and as you walk out of that cinema room you will sit down and think ""That is what the movies are made for."" Although seen from teared filled eyes, the performance by all the cast and especially Phoenix and De Niro's performance as Arthur and Murray are some of the best in history with haunting and chilling moments that make you question who the good guy here is.
I love superhero films and i have very high standards when film making is experimenting with these established characters but my words are lost to the element of fulfilment i am at. The FLAWLESS script packs a punch with turns of emotion and surprise every second and it is a great way to use your time on this Earth and sit back and SMILE!. I wrote this 30 minuets after seeing this film and i am still overwhelmed but i can only leave you on 3 points:Leave this film as a solo outing and we can all be happy...You will never get another chance to see this in cinema so GO NOW!!Bring On The Clowns!DC have had a rough outing lately but this film has improved and adjusted what i fought was good cinema and i feel if you enjoy the art of film making, this film is a must see. 10/10."
4938,"After the movie everyone in my cinema (Hong Kong) couldn't stand up for a while, that is how strong and heavy this movie is"
4939,"Quality is a word that could fit wonderfully next to this movies' title. Incredible acting, very nicely constructed scenes and a really innovative point of view for a hero movie. That's art.PS: Joaquin deserves the Oscar."
4940,"This movie is an absolute masterpiece. Joker present us with mixed feelings for the character, pain, fear, love, maniac and utterly beautiful inner darkness. Joaquin diserves an Oscar."
4941,"Joaquin Phoenix once again proved to be one of the most versatile actors of our age. He for sure will carry home many awards this year and rightfully so, because it would be a crime not to recognize his astonishing performance portraying such complex characters.
The movie is intense and touches a lot of important topics: battle with mental illnesses, the war between the rich and the poor, injustice, lack of empathy, etc. When life is so bad that the villain becomes the hero and a leader of a movement. A very tragic, thought provoking story that leaves you with many questions about the world we live in."
4942,"Although Arthur Fleck had a sick sense of humor that was often times off putting, yet the biggest joke of all related to the film is the media and metacritic coverage. Shock journalism has done a massive disservice to Joaquin Phoenix, Todd Phillips and the rest of the crew that created this wonderful film about a man that just could not get a break, and eventually broke himself.
Very reminiscent of the Taxi Driver, but much more a product of current times, Joker has a dark message to share about the instability and cruelty of our modern society while at the same time serving as a great character study and origin story for this infamous villain."
4943,Pls make like movies really good no words to say thank I 👍🏽
4944,"Probably the best acting performance ever. And I don't say that lightly.
I don't remember the last time I watched a film and delved so deeply into the mind of the main character. It's scary, depressing at times.. but a shockingly real mirror on western society. From the smallest details in scenes, the viewer can abstract and pull real life experiences.
It takes the viewer so deep inside the mind of an indivudual who is confused on his reality vs consensus reality. We are taken on a journey of realisations, discovery of past trauma and floor shattering, life changing discoveries that even makes the viewer question their reality, their past and their capacity to fall into a confused state of mind. Once Patrick's floor of reality is taken from below him, he doesn't know how to react, his worldview is flipped and he is thrown into a freefall of madness. You as the viewer go there with him and the acting performance is so brilliant, you really feel all his anxieties and confusion of reality transferred onto you.A depressing film, I left the cinema is desperate need of positive thoughts.
However.. as one of the most important films of the decade I believe this film should be inspected and thought deeply about the problems in our society."
4945,"The movie is well written well directed and extremely well performed. Not sure of its worth oscars or not but it sure deserves your attention and will be retained in memory for years to come.DC rocks, you just need good writers.."
4946,Such an amazing character study. great cinematography. the score is eerie yet beautiful and phoenix performance is Oscar worthy
4947,Realistic portrayal of someone with mental illness. Brilliant performance by Joaquin Phoenix. Not a popcorn flick but a must watch for Joker fans.
4948,"Woww. It's awesome. Very moving. It's not a mcu movie just 2 action,2 funny scenes
There is a lot of emotion, character, society problem, art, creativity in acting and direction,. Everyone should see this. I don't know why many people are spreading hate and negativity in this. Mainly dumb rt critics I mean marvel fan boyieesssss who became rt critica"
4949,"Great film, if uncomfortable to watch in parts. This is not a comic book film. It's a character study of a severely mentally ill person, Arthur Flek, who seems to be living under a permanently dark cloud as life dumps on him from every angle even when he's trying to act positively. His mother had always told him to put on a happy face and bring joy and laughter to the world. Even to the extent of calling him Happy. He also has a condition where he uncontrollably breaks into laughter. However inside he is all negative thoughts and this is tearing him apart, even his therapist won't listen.An amazing performance from Pheonix that deserves an Oscar in my mind. He's a very different Joker to Ledger however. Ledgers joker was highly intelligent and anarchic with a dose of insanity. This Joker is insane to the membrane and almost stumbles into the role of the instigator of anarchy and destruction.Many critics have severely dropped the ball on this one. The film won an award at the Venice film festival but on IMDB while viewers reviews stand at 9/10 which is about right on my reckoning, the critics stand at 5.8, only certain critics have given it the credit it deserves.I think many critics have wondered about the influence of the film. Amongst a plethora of films with large amounts of casual violence, one critic even asked the question about ""is the violence justified"" in this film. The violence in Joker is relatively limited compared to many modern films but when it comes its hard hitting and the psychotic nature of it is in no way glamourising violence. Another said the ""social commentary is garbage"". Really?The film sketches out the development of the character that gives the reasons for why he turns out to be a killer. However please do not confuse reasons set out through a careful and consistent character development with justification of the killing. This is not the same thing - being afraid to come up with reasons because it may be confused as justification can result in rather insipid films. Another person could experience the same and never turn out to be a killer. Its when you put a person with psychopathic tendencies through this mill with virtually useless mental health support and give him the means and motivation for violence then the result is tending on the inevitable.Incidentally, there is a very interesting documentary I saw about psychopaths where the narrator takes the ""psychopath test"" and finds out that he has many traits common to a psychopath and realises that it explains some of the aspects of this personality but the reason why he his a normal functioning and valuable citizen is because he had a good loving upbringing and supportive family.Flek lives in a city that itself is falling apart, the garbage isn't being collected and even super rats are roaming the streets. Even then there appear to be many that are living in wealth and even mocking the poor. Seriously what do you think may be likely to happen? Anyone heard of the French revolution (although no it actually nowhere as bad as that!)? If your someone who wants to keep this aspect of our reality ""under the lid"" and out of sight maybe you wont like this film. Otherwise go and enjoy!"
4950,"I was blown away by the acting skills of Joaquin Phoenix. As the movie moves forward you start to emerge in the movie, more and more every second. The movie tries to get you really interested in the tragedy of Arthur Fleck likes it's smoothly going up like a roller coaster but when it hits, it hits like a car crash you are completely devastated by shocks and thrills that are delivered by the movie. I never thought that anyone would be able to portray the character of Joker as finely did by Heath Ledger but Man o Man this is just a complete another level. The movie has dark humor, it is tragic but it makes your ideology struggle for if what Arthur did was right or wrong. If you haven't watched this movie you are missing a milestone of acting set by Joaquin Phoenix. This movie is another level of awesome at another level of darkness. If you thought Joker was twisted you will come to know in this movie that people are more twisted. Truly a masterpiece."
4951,"Simple as that. Joker is a masterpiece. As a character driven origin film, this is the quintessential DC movie.As a film, Joker is incredible to behold. It almost feels like an honour watching some of the best cinematography and directing of this year come alive right before your eyes. Each shot is like a painting perfectly making use of the 80's athsetic.Joaquin Phoenix puts in a career best performance, equalling and some times surpassing Ledgers take in 'The Dark Knight'. The supporting cast around him is fantastic too from De Niro as the Gotham talk show host to Zeze Beetz as Arthurs Flecks love interest and neighbor.Joker is one of the best films of 2019 and extremely important now more than ever with its realistic take on how mental illness affects us and the people around us. I cant say enough how this film is A MASTERPIECE!"
4952,"I'm literally home lying down trying to digest what I just saw. This movie was a masterpiece. It definitely requires more than one viewing to truly appreciate and understand the masterful work. This was my first viewing so I'll hold off on throwing out any ratings etc, but let me tell you this: it was a journey! It was honestly the little things that I was able to notice that really convinced me of Joaquin's performance. And his ability to just throw that laugh out there off and on cue was insane. This movie is truly something special!
Phoenix did an excellent job capturing the essence of the character in his performance.
I actually understood the protagonist, his inner battles, his journey. It was Genius, pure genius. It was in my opinion hauntingly excellent, and executed with great precision.
They basically just made this portrayal more realistic. Although it wasn't comic accurate (which it wasn't meant to be), I was happy to see Joker go off and be his true maniacal self. In other words, that R rating did wonders for his character. Much like Logan!
My only issue with it is the fact that they made this masterful piece to just be a one off. Why can't they make a cinematic universe built like this? Just like the MCU."
4953,"I normally would cringe at the thought of giving any film a 10 rating, no movie is perfect and I guess this isn't either, but for me I suppose this gets pushed from a 9 to a 10 just for being the type of film that Hollywood just doesn't make anymore.This movie takes one of comic's most famous mad clowns and takes you with him on the soul destroying journey of how he became Joker. Don't listen to the online loonies, this movie won't make you attack anyone, it will however make you think about mental illness and the people who suffer in silence. As well as the general, but basic, concept of kindness to others.On this journey, though you often vehemently disagree with joker's actions, you're nonetheless compelled to understand those choices. Phoenix and Phillips don't just deserve Oscars for this, what they've created essentially amounts to a treatise on the more tragic side of the human condition"
4954,"Sat in the theater without any context , story started building with the perfect background score , you don't even wanna relate the acting of previous joker to this one , they were defined as sociopaths, but this one , you watch him see become one , and no Not a sociopath but a pyscopath. A damned unlucky human under the radar of life , JOKER has every thing a good movie should have , and this one's great !"
4955,"A good movie for me is almost entirely weighted in its ability to stir emotions. Boy was I moved. It is the masterpiece that everyone speaks of. This Joker is very relatable, while his experiences and his reactions are more extreme than for most of us, when you see how environment shapes him it makes his character very real.Character development is amazing. Music score is epic! Acting is fantastic. Every angle is perfection. This is quite possibly the best movie of all time. I find all the people hilarious who share the same sentiments and rate it a 9."
4956,"Joaquin Pheonix gave a career best performance but Screenplay and story took away that Masterpiece crown from this film. It's Excellent but not Masterpiece. I love the way he act but it is difficult to understand in 1st Time. You need to watch this movie at least 2-3 to understand everything. 1st Half was boring but last 25 minutes were Magnificent
Acting - 5/5
Direction - 4/5
BGM - 4/5
Screenplay - 3/5
Story - 3/5"
4957,"This was absolutely jaw dropping. If JP doesn't get best actor for this then the Oscars should be permanently disregarded as an absolute farce. Unlike 99.99% of mainstream films this was intelligent, is multi layered and has bucket loads to think about.. credit should be given to Warner bros for not issuing Deadpool part 26 and taking a chance on something extremely dark and very challenging for a mainstream audience. If anyone likes this, check out a documentary called Hail Satan? , which has a similar theme of examining 'otherness'. The best mainstream film of the decade for me."
4958,"Acting and tone on point. The film is dark, desperate. The occasional flare of hope is always shattered to pieces in a way that - at the end - makes the viewer sympathize with all the violence.
However, key scenes, to me at least, always felt somewhat predictable. But even having a good idea of what's gonna happen, will not make this movie any less shocking."
4959,"First and foremost i loath todays marvel and DC movies for being so over the top and for being cheesier that an Olympic size swimming pool filled with Cèso. Okay i will admit i liked guardians of the galaxy and avengers end game but that is it. But i can go see a million movies like this one if they had the same feel and performance as Joker did. It was so gritty and realistic i felt apart of that world, the cinematography was so good it was like fine art. And speaking of fine art Joaquin Phoenix needs to win an Oscar for his magnificent and believable performance i was awestruck threw out the entirety of the film at this man commitment to his his art. He has risen out of the fire and has become the joker. I have no other joker now he is the joker. Yes heath and jack are still great jokers but neither of them to it to level of Phoenix diving deep into the man himself. The director is also a genius the plot was relevant and impactful, the twist and turns were cleverly hidden, he was true yet unique the the joker universe. I have heard some critics say it had no message or meaning if this is true then why are we still taking about this movie days later and not just asking if you have seen it but really having deep conversations about it? I find myself still contemplating the film and will go watch it a 4th time this week cause I am not yet satisfied my quench has not yet been satisfied i need more. Go watch this film and forget about the sjw critics and media the are destroying their own art"
4960,"I've watched the dubbed version because of my schedule but I can't wait to watch the subbed version. Even if the film was not on their original version I could feel Joaquin's act by his action and facial expression I was deeply focused on the screen on the whole movie. I felt sorry for Arthur, even knowing that he is not right. I think this movie is amazing to show how Joker became Joker. I can wait to watch this movie again."
4961,Speechless.
4962,"Yes, Todd Phillips said that this Joker has nothing to do with the Joker from Batman.
This is just a delusion from mentally ill person in Arkham State Hospital. Everything started when psychotherapist said Arthur that they won't meet again, and when Arthur stated that he won't be able to get the medication.
When Arthur stopped taking medications, everything started. From murders, Sophia, Murrey, Thomas Wayne, everything went to hell after that. At the end of the movie, psychotherapist is smiling at him. If he did everything he did, she won't be smiling.I expected character development close to Walter White. Mentally ill loser (Walter was physically ill) starting to snap because of injustice and torture. When he is Arthur Fleck, he looks normal from the outside, but he isn't from the inside. When he is under make up, he gets self-confidence, because he is someone else at that moment. After years of self pity and injustice, a moment happens when he feels someone's fear of him. And more he brings his own justice, he gets more confidence. And as movie goes, he became lost in his own view of justice. He started from someone like Walter White and became Heisenberg. More he feels it, more he likes it. He became what he is, because he believe justice is what he think he is, not what society tell him.Joker could be the hero of the poor, Robin Hood who steal happiness from rich people, not only money. Batman is rich, he is the opposite to Joker. That's way Joker has so many people with him. It could become a movement, like Anonymous in modern times.I always hated superhero movies, because it never had depth in villains minds. Why do they do what they do?! Give them a reason. People did terrible things in the past because of political or religion view of life, twisted view of justice. Give him a reason to believe he is right. It could be revolutionary in super hero movies. Create villains that people could understand they nature."
4963,"This is what I was expecting. Not a lot of people would appreciate Joker but in of its glory Joker talks about how cruel society has become in this day and age. Mental Illness is a serious concern and we as a society need to tackle it headon. Issues like Child Abuse, Mental Illness, Murder and Criminal Prejudice are the core of this movie. Anyone who goes in expecting a comic book movie is mistaken. You can't compare Joker to any other CBM it's a depiction of the character in real life. It's one of those rare stories where the villain wins and we see it from his perspective."
4964,"I dont understand the hate. I was very excited for this movie, then I read some reviews saying that it isnt actually good. But why? I saw one review where s/he literally wrote that s/he wanted to see a villain killing for no reason. Is that how a story works? If someone is a psycho. There has to be some reason and proper explanation about what he is doing or why he is doing. Killing people without any reason doesnt bring any character arc to the character. I think Phoenix nailed it as the Joker. His acting was perfect. If we talk about Cinematography, then its pretty notched up. The violence and action in this movie isnt high like any other superhero movie. But I think thats what make this movie more realistic and relatable to the real world. I am a die hard marvel fan, and I loved this movie. Music score is top notched, you would have heard it in the teaser trailer. His laughs really shows someone with suffering nd pain. The best thing I observe about this movie is that its well placed. The scenes have been deleted and cut in a proper manner, to give the exact runtime that a plot like this should have. It just didnt feel stretched. I lob"
4965,"A ride that makes us feel connected. A journey that leaves a beautiful flavor of acting for long time. I should Thank Todd Phillips for imagining in a sensible way for portraying a perfect character. There are several edge of the seat moments and several jump out of shock moments. On the whole movie makes us to a roller coster of emotions played by just one MAN. I went with an open mind and came back with a heavy heart. I didnt see what's coming. Yes, Joaquin deserves an Oscar and it's a gunshot decision. Really tough to make an expression in a convincing manner that is either a laugh or condition or just sad or cry. HANDS DOWN J."
4966,"Before I touch upon the content of the movie , I have to say the vibe it creates is like a Taxi Driver of the modern age with super villain in the making overtones ; which is funny because Deniro is in the joker , I wonder if the director did this purposefully ?Anyways , this movie was an amalgamation of emotions stirred up for a person I didn't think I ever cared for , aside from being a badass in a previous portrayal by Heath. Let's put this to rest right now ; Joaquin's Joker was so real to the point that I connected on a more personal level (than previous jokers including heaths) and I can see authenticity in this joker being THE joker that eventually faces off with Bats - even in this ""depressing"" formative period of his .... despite being exposed to an action packed super intelligent Heath Joker years before this .The feeling of powerlessness and a world against you is really what gets you down through your first 40 minutes or so in the movie but it's not a depressingly down feeling it's more of a contemplatively-down feeling for Arthur's condition and his situation in life . Essentially , it's hard to NOT feel for Arthur as opposed to what previous movies would conjure up in us for the joker - which always painted him as a one sided villain as opposed to the complex more than human Joker we see in this film.Overall the scenes were shot so well I felt like I was watching an old movie, which also helped complete the feeling of taxi driver (also that revolver Joker gets seems like a snubbed version of it), but also gave the setting of the film a perfect alibi - this WAS INDEED the time before Batman ; and we can tell from the scenery , the outfits and the props ... very well done. I feel although there's no promise of a sequel , the director and cast HAS to deliver a sequel - as the roller coaster ride of this journey has just begun and they really pulled the tempo of the film off correctly as to really entice us to be hungry for more screen time of Arthur In his very earliest joker years .If I could , I would see this made into a tv series as it seems so realistic with the way it displayed this joker , and the action was spread out enough to create suspense and many other emotions . If this was done I would expect them to cast Joaquin , due to his great performance , or at least someone that can emulate his exact performance and demeanor - as this was a performance I didn't expect to ""attract"" me so much as it did .Great film , 10/10 for me - if it weren't for the critics mindlessly bashing this title I wouldn't have written this review , but I feel like this is something we need to speak up about because everyone seeing this film either really likes it or LOVES it - BESIDES the critics ... hmmm I wonder why ? Maybe it has something to do with the AGENDA of those that wish to push a specific NARRATIVE for their platform? Look that's fine and all but please be a bit more transparent with your bias if you choose to run a review website .Compare the critics to the user reviews , how many of each one and you will see who the liars are and who is telling the truth about the movie . Everythings an ""opinion"" they will say after slanging dirt in an untruthful review ... ok that's fine but don't go bashing something that was shot , edited , directed , and written WELL and try to pretend like it's just some unbiased opinion, we can see through that !I, like thousands of others , went into the film UNBIASED and loved it , do the same and you will too ; go in there thinking the movie will have your incel neighbor boy kill you , you will leave there confused just to go on your critic profile on meta critic and bash for no reason and that will guarantee you have a bad time under the guise of social semantics ."
4967,"In the years behind, Disney and Warner were dominanting the best fiction characters of the world to make money. But we got to see the real potential of dc stories with batman trilogies and now with JOKER! This movie is a stand alone original story based on what batman comics are saying. We need more movies like this."
4968,"A great character study and origin of the infamous homicidal Clown Prince of Crime.Philip's tone and color scheme of the movie. The use of practical effects and real environments within Arthur's world made you feel apart of a time and a place, in Gotham, you have not seen before.This is by far one of Phoenixs best performances. His slow burn descent into madness kept your eyes focused on the evolution of Arthur becoming Joker. He takes an interesting approach to this Joker, that is immensely entertaining from beginning to end.It is the most unique and definitive origin of the Joker we have ever seen on screen.Long story short it was a great movie."
4969,"If you didn't like this movie, it wasn't for you. If you did like this movie, you almost definitely loved it. It seems more people fall into the latter category.As director Todd Phillips said on stage before the TIFF screening, ""It's a slow burn, but it's worth it"". Indeed it is!I could go into the plot but no one wants to hear that before seeing a movie. I will say this much, it will give you chills and goose bumps when it's moment arrives.Watch this movie. There's a better than 50% chance you'll love it."
4970,"DC is back and better. Gritty, dark, depressing! Omg I can't say enough, I didn't believe the hype because people typically are stupid but after seeing people bash the movie for being too dark, I knew it was my kind of movie. I could feel the anguish and laughed when I wasn't supposed to. Joaquin has always been a phenomenal actor but he truly shone in this movie, yes give the man his Oscar! I need more of these movies ASAP."
4971,Definitely going back to watch again! the best movie i have seen so far this year and Joaquin Phoenix´s performance would make Heath Ledger proud.
4972,"First review I've ever felt compelled to write for a film...This film definitely lived up to the hype surrounding it and more!
After seeing Phoenix had been cast for the role, I was extremely excited as I've been a huge fan of his acting since his portrayal of Johnny Cash in Walk The Line. Never the less, I, like so many others was slightly sceptical that he may not live up to Heath Ledger's Joker but wanted to reserve judgement until seeing the film.
How wrong I was to have any scepticism. Phoenix's performance is for me the best acting I have ever seen in any film. Ever! I could not take my eyes off him on the screen in the cinema.
The film itself was much darker than I was expecting which I found really refreshing - tacking the issues surrounding personality disorders and mental health and how society can drive an individual to madness. Such a fantastic origin story that could simply be a stand alone film and still work without any links to the comic books.
I saw the film 4 days ago and don't think I've ever left a cinema feeling so utterly blown away by a film in my life. I have not stopped thinking about the film since and cannot wait to watch this masterpiece of film making and acting masterclass again.
Jaoquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips should win every award going when awards season arrive.
And I agree with other comments about Ledgers and Phoenix's portrayals not being comparable. But for me Phoenix's has just slightly edged it 🤡"
4973,"Best DC movie I ever seen.This movie has no stunts, but it is even more shocking."
4974,"First of all, from the bad reviews I've read, it seems they all went into the cinema with expectations. Being open minded about a movie has never been more necessary. This movie is not enjoyable. This movie is horrible. This movie makes you feel like crap. All in the most amazing way possible.Go watch it! Now!"
4975,Outstanding and an amazing. Would definitely recommend that you see it.
4976,"The movie is amazing, acting is superb, no childish action or CGI superhero nonsense. It's pure acting and pure cinema. Joaquin Phoenix should get an Oscar for this.Everyone is comparing it to Heath Ledger's Joker, I don't think it's comparable. I mean it's the same character but that is all, it ends there, this is much deeper and much more serious, we should compare it to Taxi Driver with Robert De Niro who also plays here (was that intentional?). Joker is a 150 years old character, he's the Underground Man and the he was created by Dostoevsky. Watch it."
4977,"Overwhelming, Mesmerizing, Disturbing and Beautiful. This is not your typical comic book movie adaptation crap, it is a tragedy. It is the tragedy of Arthur Fleck, his rebirth as Joker, a transformation of someone troubled to a psychopath let loose. Phoenix is surely getting a nomination for his phenomenal performance it is just as if he doesn't simply act but becomes the Joker. A feast for eyes and EARS. Check Hildur Guðnadóttir, her score is amazing for this movie."
4978,"I wanna start by saying that I was a skeptic of this movie but it delivered 10fold and then some. I swore not to get caught up in the hysteria that is Batman's greatest foe but it's well earned and only furthers the mystique that is the Clowned Prince.Addressing the fake news originally reported by Vicki Vale about people walking out of the movie. If you happened to be amongst those weak souls; you deserve every bit of Batman vs Superman and probably list Val Kilmer as your fav Batman😒If you complained at the political undertones I can only conclude you've never seen a DC show. There were some but I saw it more as: art imitating life. Say all this to say: Joker was the blockbuster that DC so desperately needed; Joaquin deserves a standing ovation. It may be an origin story for the Joker but it ultimately serves as a origin story for Batman! Not all too sure where they from here but I'm along for the ride.Lastly be kind to the local weirdo, we all have internal struggles that the world will forever be oblivious of, instead lend a helping hand. Who knows that weirdo may just kill you last?!"
4979,"Joaquin reis nailed it. It was unbelievable, and I would laugh at it if someone said to me that you would cry in this film."
4980,"Mr. Phoenix's performance is outstanding.
A movie with a deep message!
Hopefully he will be nominates for Oscar!
Regards,
C."
4981,"This is not a Superhero Movie - Be Warned. Joker from the first clip to last will draw you in and make you believe you are there.The fitting lunch line 'You get what you deserve' sums up Arthur's descent into the violent persona of The Joker concluding with murder, mayhem and madness.Joaquin Phoenix should be a slam dunk to win the Oscar and Robert DeNiro is superb as the Johnny Carson of Gotham. Todd Phillips has grounded this movie into a believable tale of abuse and revenge."
4982,"I watched this 3 days after release and had seen some of the best reviews of any film in history.I was hesitant to get behind the hype due to the DC universe being arguably one of the worst in cinema history (well, ever since Bale left the Batman role). But rest assured, this is in no way connected the Batfleck, Suicide Sqaud failures.Phoenix was never an actor on my radar, wasn't one I really paid attention too. But this performance was outstanding. I suffer from mental health issues, and granted, his are far worse than mine, I related to the secluded personality he portrayed.I implore you, watch this film. Love this film and remember it for all time. Joaquin is walking straight to an academy award for this."
4983,"'What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner, with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash? You get what you deserve!'The above quote is from Todd Phillips' brash new smash hit movie; 'Joker', which is based on DC's famous comic book villain. Never before has this infamous DC character which remains one of the most well-known comic book characters, had its own origin movie. Critics and fans alike have showered praise on Joaquin Phoenix, who has given a ground breaking performance which adds humanity to a character whose villainous exploits are well known, but the character itself remains an anomaly. Yet the film has also received some criticism, not because of Phoenix's performance or Todd Phillip's direction, but on the movie being too 'dark', and supposedly glorifying violence. This criticism is quite surprising, as neither the violence in the movie is more excessive than seen in recent years, and in terms of being 'dark', then once again it matches at the very least movies like, 'Mother!'; and 'The Killing of a Sacred Deer'. So what is the real reason for the supposed walk outs from showings of the film, and those 'offended' viewers who have had to resort to using social media outlets to vent their disgust? The answer lies within all of us, and how society as a whole views people with mental illness. 'Joker' is a movie that attempts to achieve something rare in cinema, and that is to bring realism to a comic book story, by raising important questions about modern day society. The film dares to be more than a fun filled, CGI injected comic book adaptation, and this is why some fans seem unsettled. Surely if watching grown men in costumes, is what you love, then you have had your fair share of the 'Avengers' saving the world, battling against outer-galactic enemies. However with 'Joker' we have the portrayal of a man who has suffered for most of his life, at the hands of his carers, professionals, colleagues, and most others who have crossed his path. Arthur Fleck, a la 'Joker', is a man who has been diagnosed with mental illness, and is struggling to lead a normal life, yet fails to receive the support he clearly requires. Arthur whose plight is ignored, becomes a victim of abuse at the hands of people who fail to understand him. Eventually something snaps, and the results are tragic. People who have criticised the film, have claimed that Arthur/Joker's actions may be used as inspiration by similarly disadvantaged people to perpetrate violence against society. Yet these short sighted individuals fail to understand the potent message behind the lead up to Arthur's transformation. However I am sure if the movie had shown that the acts of violence was committed by a foreigner, with a religious motive, than it would have been easily accepted. The fact that the film shows how society can drive a mentally ill white male to commit 'terrorist' acts have stirred some uncomfortable feelings about how we view mental illness, and even the stereo type of people perceived to be dangerous in our society. Or perhaps this movie does not fit the agenda we wish to consider at the moment. The discussion of mental illness, and its effects, have not yet been passed down from the government, because they still haven't finished with trying to force LGBT down our throats. Being part of that rainbow movement is fashionable at the moment, yet being a mentally ill loner has not yet reached the priority list of the policy makers.I would advise that people accept what the film is trying to show, even if the climax is difficult to watch, or even more difficult to accept. We need to reflect upon how many people are suffering from mental illness, and how it effects them and their families. I have always felt that it is movies that are inspired by reality, and not the other way around. Joker is a bleak yet bold statement about the injustices of a society that preys on the weak, and maybe that's what we don't like."
4984,Excellent performance accompanied by stellar storytelling.
4985,Really good movie and btw people are so pathetic and miserable. Just read all the low rating comments lmao
4986,"Below is the transcript from my video review on my YouTube channel, Slice of Pai. Please subscribe, would mean the world to me and I'm trying to change it :)The Joker. I'm not joking when I say this could be the first time that two different actors could win an Oscar for playing the same character.Now the Joker is one of the most iconic villains of all time, but do not walk into this expecting it to be a typical comicbook movie with blockbuster action.First and foremost it is a character study of the Joker, of one man's descent into madness, but the terrifying part was just how real it all felt. Arthur Fleck, A Fleck, Affleck? is a really sympathetic character at the beginning of the movie and you really feel for him when you see how mistreated he gets just for being different and misunderstood. Things just keep going from bad to worse for him over the course of the movie until he finally snaps when he gets pushed to the edge.And when he hit Rock Bottom, he rose from the ashes like a Joaquin Phoenix.
Because at the end of the day, this is his movie and he carried it with ease. He has clearly been psychologically scarred, his laugh is something like a tic from a neurological condition and he does have something of an Oedipal complex as well. You can see the Joker's physical and mental transformation when he embraces his madness in all its perverse glory.Speaking of physical transformations, his method acting reminded me of Christian Bale's. His emaciated physique was a bit like the Machinest, and parts of the movie also reminded me of American Psycho and had me questioning what was real and what wasn't.As the whole movie is shot from Joker's perspective, it brings some very interesting twists to the Joker and Batman lore. I'll delve into that more in a spoiler section at the end of this video.The film is also a character study of society as a whole, and although it is set in the fictional city of Gotham in 1982, it's still social commentary for today. Too many people tear down others to feel good about themselves, too many people want to see other people fail, too many people have no empathy. The movie shows the dangers of nihilism that is caused by all of the above, and it shines a light on the importance of mental health treatment.The film also brings credence to the expression ""Don't meet your heroes"", as the public personas so many celebrities have of wanting to help people are really just facades, which is something I've noticed as well.The film was excellently directed by Todd Phillipps and although it was a slow burn, that simmering really gave Joker so much nuance and complexity. The colour palette was very gritty and Gotham-esque and gave the movie a depressed ambience to reflect Arthur's.Overall I'd give joker 4.5/5 Pais, but I'm bumping it up to 5 for Joaqin Phoenix's Oscar Worthy performance.Have you seen Joker yet? What did you think about? How do you compare the Jokers? From Hamill, to Nicholson, to Ledger and now to Phoenix? Let me know in the comments below.Thanks for watching, but if you could hit that like and subscribe button I'll thank you even more. If you haven't seen the movie yet, this is where I say bye for now. But if you have, spoiler talk is coming soon."
4987,Hahahah aye it was class like wasn't even a stupid superhero movie just some mad
4988,"Truly an incredible film, acting from Pheonix some of the best I've seen, if he doesn't win an Oscar I'll be surprised. HIGHLY RECOMMEND SEEING THIS FILM!"
4989,What a performance by Joaquin Phoenix!! What a direction by Todd Phillips!! What an amazing Origin Story! The movie lived to the Hype! This is the Joker that will be remembered for years to come!
4990,"The movie shows how a neglected common man becomes a criminal for the sake of justice. His way of doing it is through the way of chaos.Though the story connects a lot of dots with the Batman story, but still some things felt as if they were molded to fit the narrative. But overall great watch, the mood, the cinematography, acting, score are all marvelous."
4991,"Heath Ledger's Joker was a monument that embodied the character in a such a way that no other actor could ever dare to accomplish. Now, 11 years later we have an equator to that epic portrayal of the character in the name of Joaquin Phoenix. Believe it when I say.... The walk, the posture, the cold stare, it's all back on the big screen. Joaquin Phoenix brings the clown prince to life in such a way that viewers will have to think twice before blinking. Coming from Director Todd Phillips, *Joker* takes you on a trip to the Humane side of the character, something that no other Joker movie has ever done. *Joker* is the best comic book movie since *The Dark Knight* and one of the finest portrayals of *one man's descent into maddness*. Academy Awards 2020 will be a war between legends. Joaquin Phoenix vs Leonardo DiCaprio and hopefully Robert DeNiro. If you haven't watched Joker yet, then get movin'"
4992,"Joker is a human origin story that dispels the mystery behind the character known only as 'The Joker', or Jack Napier in the rarely referenced comic book lore. In this adaptation, it's a downtrodden Arthur Fleck. To me, this is not a comic book movie, it feeds into what is ultimately a comic book creation, but it offers a gritty realism that makes even 'The Dark Knight' look pretty.These are the days before the Batman dons the mask to save Gotham from itself, but 'Joker' shows how the vigilante may just be settling a longstanding debt that has come back to haunt the Wayne family, it even may suggest why Batman is merciful of The Joker - you'll see just how Batman's greatest nemesis was created - and it will surprise you to great effect; even if it differs from the traditional origin story. Some critics suggest this movie hasn't much to say, but in the context of the overarching Batman story, it absolutely does.It traded the notorious chemical incident and Chelsea smile for something perhaps a little less far-fetched - 'Joker' acknowledges the Batman universe, but the focus is very much on the concept and character that embodies the infamous clown and how the mask is a representation of chaos that can easily be spread, just as a mask can be used for justice. It's the Joker's turn in the limelight, as the Waynes are pushed to near minor characters, and cast in the shadow of moral ambiguity.Did you know that although the Joker was planned to be killed off during his initial appearance, he was spared by editorial intervention? This movie fittingly gives a nod to this part of the character's past in its closing scenes.The movie also offers an explanation for The Joker's hysterical laughing; what was once a tragedy became a comedy - and the rest is history.While fresh concepts carry this movie beyond the box office, it was slow in parts, and lacked a breadth of characters and locations. There weren't many grand sweeping shots of the Gotham landscape. There also weren't many subplots or cutaways to other characters, this isolated the plot into almost entirely Phoenix, where I feel there could have been opportunities to bring in other characters and perspectives.I disliked the subplot with Sophie Dumond as it didn't add much to the story, and also felt as if Arthur's character could have been more eccentric, instead some of his scripting was jarring, perhaps deliberately so - there needed to be more one-liners to reflect the Joker's natural wit and flair, although his outright strangeness was captured quite well, if a bit excessively.This movie delivers a solid punchline, 7.6/10."
4993,"Being a big batman guy I always thought the Joker worked better without a backstory. But I also love my dark psychological movies, so this still sounded like it was going to be ace, and it is!This isn't an action movie. It's a character study/back story and it has you feeling both sorry for and being creeped out by Phonex. Who (as everyone is saying) is amazing in the movie.This is a well told, expertly made, gritty drama which grabbed my attention in a way that over the top CGI hasn't for a while now. This film is well paced, unpredictable and shocking in all the right places. DC made the right choice in getting creative and not sticking to the superhero formula here."
4994,"The movie is piece of art, for anyone who is a fan of The Killing Joke (considered as the greatest Joker story ever made), will get the intensity, the masterstroke of character building to the intense gloom to the pervasive air of melancholia throughout, much as the character himself which is a feat worthy of a great cinematic experience and a great vision by director Todd Phillip. The movie is heavily inspired by the macabre theme from The Killing Joke to A Clockwork Orange or The King of Comedy. It is not for everyone's palate, if you can take away gruesome violence and depression on screen as a work of art rather than an expression of reality, then this film works for you.
The character of Arthur Fleck aka The Joker, played to sheer brilliance by Joaquin Phoenix, from his maniacal laughter evoked as a reaction to his inner anxieties which he initially mentions as a neurological disorder but later realizes it has always been a natural part of him, to his rage while killing to his dance of joy is a treat to watch albeit uneasy for some, that is the victory of a great actor. Arthur Fleck has no method to his madness but his transformation from a person suffering from state of endogenous depression living with his deranged mother, being a victim of abuse since childhood and constant bullying to a person on vengeance in a moment of emotional breakdown leading to his killing spree and to the eventual anarchist spiral to becoming Gotham's greatest evil.
We also have Robert De Niro in small yet key role as a talk show host whose pivotal end marks the complete transformation of Arthur to The Joker.
The director feeds multiple fan theory on the Batman Joker half-brother angle, there is even a scene between Arthur and the child Bruce which may lay the foundation to their future encounters, there is also the oft repeated Batman Origin story scene of murder outside the Opera which has now been a given a new twist as to why it happened and how.
The movie is so beautifully shot from the jaded 70s feel to the retro lighting and the wonderful camera angles with a superb background score elevating intense scenes to another level.
As Joker remarks in The Killing Joke - ""it only takes one bad experience to flip any good person"". Hahahahahahhehehehehe........"
4995,"It is hard to describe the content and acting as anything other than astonishing. I felt uncomfortable, nervous and excited all at the same time through both of my current viewings, followed by a chilling buzz during the last few sequences of the film.
Phoenix's performance is nothing but perfect, I believed he was Arthur Fleck/Joker the entire way through and find it hard to look at him the same way now, all I can see is Joker. His performance was painful to watch, but in the right way. This is a character that does terrible things, but his journey and struggles are heart breaking to watch, the performance never lets off, you never feel truly comfortable.
Tod Philips did a great job of bringing an original in-depth version of the Joker to screen and I have no problem at all with it mimicking past films, it brings them all together is a justified and brilliant way.
This is now one of my favourite films ever, deserving the the praise it gets...the critics, clearly they just got offended."
4996,"Great acting
Great story
Stunning movie !!!
Love this movie"
4997,"After seeing this movie, I was totally blank! I kept asking myself ""What did I just watch?"" Acting, direction, and man...! The sound track! It's very very depressing and suits the flow of the theme. This movie is perfect adaption of the DC's most dangerous villain ~ Joker! And I must say JP should mr nominated for oscars! Best DC movie that I have ever seen! Thanks Todd Philips for this amazing gift!"
4998,"Featuring spectacular performance by Joaquin Phoenix ""Joker"" brings my best movie experience of the year.
The script is very elaborate, full of unexpected twists and the movie. The soundtrack of the film is very striking, the color palette is a spectacle and the close-ups on the protagonist only raise the level of the film.
I do not understand how critics may have rated this movie so poorly. The challenge is to get the audience to see the world through the lens of the villain and that it can do very well without redeeming Arthur's crimes and villainy.
Joker is the movie I most enjoyed watching in 2019 and also has become one of my favorite movies of all ! Grade 10 more than deserved."
4999,"Good story
Good actor
Good Director"
5000,"Joker - A supervillain created by Bill Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson
Nothing in comparison to the Actors who played joker previously (Not even Considering Jared Leto here)
This character of Arther Fleck (Mentally ill with serious depression and anxiety disorders) stands out as a Class Apart.
The transformation from a Guy that needed Therapy to a Psychotic Killer is unparalleled.
Jokers back story was never fully discussed or shown until this one.
Setting in a time wherein Bruce Wayne is still a Kid.
Arther Fleck is seem fighting a battle of his own within himself that the world/Society chooses to ignore and not care.
This is one movie in a long time that's made me sit through on the edge of the seat without diverting my attention throughout the movie.
Director Todd Philips shine through and truly Deserved that 8minuite Standing Ovation they received at the Premiere.
So much close what we can relate to and that we choose to ignore.
This films Screams right into the heart of every generation.
They must get an Oscar for this one.
Closest to a Perfect Story Telling."
5001,"Hmmm, initially I wanted to give it a nine for how Phoenix's acting really gripped me throughout the movie. But considering how it turned the movie into a one-man show I must think twice, and here it goes ...... an eight!"
5002,"Within the first few minutes you can't help but feel empathy for Arthur, it's heartbreaking to watch the world be so cruel to him and for him to not fit anywhere. The movie takes you on a journey of feeling sad then to feeling disturbed as Arthur devolves into Joker. At the beginning of the movie he states he did best in hospital care, which is where he should've stayed. This is a movie about how society turns its back on people with mental illness and disabilities, giving them no place in this world and making them feel alone and isolated, which is absolutely heartbreaking. Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant and he deserves to win an award for his performance. If you don't want to watch some of the disturbing stuff, you can cover your eyes like I did, it's pretty obvious when it's about to happen so you can look away if prefer."
5003,"Joaquin phoenix was amazing!,a fully masterpiece,the film is make us too feel sympathy about arthur fleck and angry to society at the same time,the scoring was good make us feel about arthur sufferring"
5004,Loved it!! The joker was so well portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix! This movie was perfect in every way! Amazing job putting this master piece together!!
5005,"I know that there has been a lot of hubbub about this film, where people are saying that it was misogynistic or that it's the ""incel movie"", but I have to say that if people say this after watching the movie... they clearly weren't paying attention.If this film has any message, it's that the mental health system is severely flawed and that everyday life is geared towards the rich. It's understaffed and underfunded, resulting in people who really, REALLY want to seek out help (as in the case of Arthur at the beginning of the film) going with subpar or no help at all. Not to mention that the system in place ended up cutting public funding, which is an all too bitter reflection on what happens IRL to programs such as these. Then for the news to paint the three dead Wayne Enterprises guys as practically saints and for Wayne to effectively paint all of the city's poorer citizens as stupid, jealous, and violent clowns as a result, that just hammers home that the system is more in favor of the ""have"" than the ""have nots"". With all of that, it's no surprise that the citizens of Gotham rioted. They were treated like the garbage that littered their streets. The Joker was just a catalyst that really set the smoldering unrest ablaze and I honestly think that if it wasn't him, it would have been someone else. He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time and became an icon as a result. I have to say that I really do like how the Joker said that he wasn't a political person. When it comes to public aid and how people are treated, this shouldn't be treated as only a political thing. Yes, it can be political but it's fundamentally a moral issue - it's wrong to treat people as lesser and to cut funding that would benefit the less fortunate in order to make things easier for the fortunate and their pet projects. It's made painfully clear throughout the film that if Arthur had received any true human compassion beyond the caring yet distant compassion offered by his social worker or the manipulative and deluded compassion his mother gave him (if you can even call her behaviors that), his life may have gone in a different direction. Maybe not incredibly different, but still different.Joaquin Phoenix did an excellent job as the Joker. It's kind of amazing to see how much he sunk into that role. He lost so much weight that it's really startling and helps to form a good suspension of disbelief. Hollywood uses so many of the same actors that many of them come across as ""This Person playing themselves playing X character"". I see Phoenix as one of those actors that, while recognizable, can fully lose themselves in a character and are more than just playing themselves playing someone.I was really amazed at how quickly the film went by. Some of the moments were honestly painful to watch, as it's easy enough to feel sorry for Arthur at times. He's just so sad and broken that you can't help but wish that things would go a little better. I also loved the little nods to the various comic book series that featured the Joker, such as the Dr. Sally kiss - a scene taken from The Dark Knight Returns. It's subtle without demanding that the viewer know about the comics in the way that Batman vs. Superman did of its viewers. No viewer will feel like they had to study before going into the theater. Of note, however, is that apparently the director has stated that this isn't THE Joker, but rather a person that inspired him.All in all, I think that this will be one of those films that will be studied in film classes, yet dismissed as a ""violent nasty"" by some in the same way that some critics are now. I can understand that some won't like this - no film will be universally liked, but I can't help but feel that by focusing on the violence they're really kind of missing the point of this movie."
5006,"I've been on imdb for years, this is my first review and let me say I've been waiting for this film all year!!! At first I thought it was over hyped but It's OUTSTANDING Joaquin Phoenix delivers a phenomenal ""OSCAR"" performance from beginning to end, The best DC movie since the Dark Knight. A MUST SEE! going this weekend for the 2nd time..."
5007,"Not just a movie it is an masterpiece
awesome story and great acting it is one of the greatest movie of all times ..
JOKER is not a villan he is an hero for me"
5008,"This movie is probably the best movie of the year. Joaquin Phoenix is a prodigy and his Joker is one the best interpretation in the history of cinema.
He truly deserves the Academy Award. One of the best actors of our generation"
5009,"I will keep it short.
Joaquin really pulled it off so good, to me at least as good as Heath Ledger (RIP). The movie is truly splendid by acting, plot, social message, background music etc. And RIP Ginger Baker as I heard White Room in this movie towards the end.
This is an absolute must see movie. I am sure it will hit the top list of IMDB."
5010,This film was beautifully done. Joaquin embodied the role of a cynical yet misfortunate soul that was shaped into becoming a justifiable villain.
5011,"If I started typing, I wouldn't finish until they drop Part 2
Where should i begin , the hilarious laugh, the massive emotional pain or The depth of the contained darkness of The one and Only JOKER
If i was able to rate this movie with an infinity mark , i would have did that a long time agoJust watch this movie and you will definitely see why am excited so much"
5012,the movie is absolutely amazing
5013,"Joaquin pheonix takes on another whole new outstanding, dark,terrifying take on joker in which he performed in his own version of the character. Movie was an indept character study of joker and had it's best and intense moments."
5014,"An acting masterpiece.An eerily convincing performance, in league with Jack Nicholson in the Shining and Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs.Phoenix should be the top contender to date for the Best Actor Oscar."
5015,"Well if you're the type of person that looks at the irony of life and laughs, then you'll know what i mean."
5016,"I can't even describe how I felt while walking out of the cinema. Feelings that I've not felt in a veeeeery long time after watching a movie, reappeared: Happiness, inspiration, deepness. This movie is brilliant. I couldn't believe that FINALLY they created a masterpiece among all the Hollywood that has been coming out lately. I actually was afraid, desillusioned and somewhat sure that this movie would be again just another generic movie, I didn't believe the critics neither. But I'm glad I was wrong. THIS. THIS is the kind of movies that need to be made!!!The scenes drew me in like if they were real, they potrayed everything extremely well. Crude scenes were really disturbing, no horrible soundtrack, no horrible CGI, no shallowness.
The acting was incredible too; prior watching the movie I read some other reviews from ""professional"" critics and they mentioned a lot that the acting was too overwhelming; seriously, WHAT? I think they want some more generic acting or they can't understand what a mentally I'll person actually suffers and how they act. I don't know what is wrong with them, but THIS is the acting that the world actually admires.
Joaquin did a super job and portrayed incredibly well the Arthur to Joker transformation as well as his crude problems.
I'm very grateful that finally we have a real movie.
Absolutely 10/10"
5017,"Joker was one of the most anticipated movies of the year and it certainly lived up to all the hype. Although the movie starts off slow, once the ball gets rolling it gets better and better. In a word, the movie was incredible. Joaquin Phoenix was amazing as Arthur Fleck who slowly descends into madness as he adopts his alter ego Joker.Set in Gotham City in 1981, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) works as a clown who is barely clinging onto his day job. Arthur suffers from a neurological condition that causes him to laugh at inappropriate times and is also seeing a psychologist who encourages him to keep a journal as well as prescribing him medication for his mental illness. Arthur also lives with his ailing and mentally ill mother Penny (Frances Conroy) in a downtrodden apartment. Arthur also aspires to become a stand up comedian which attracts the attention of talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) of whom Arthur idolises. After several events which contributes to Arthur's self destruction and descent into madness, Arthur adopts his alter ego Joker and blazes a trail of murder, chaos and delusional behaviour.Although Joker is set in the DC Comics universe, Joker does well as a standalone movie going back to the beginning and director Todd Phillips (The Hangover) is handed the creative reigns to do whatever he wanted with the infamous character in an alternate world that completely detaches itself from the Batman series.Joaquin Phoenix was amazing and I'm tipping that he will be netting several awards for his performance. Putting aside the previous performances of Joker in the past, Joaquin Phoenix earns himself a spot amongst elite company alongside Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, Cesar Romero and Jared Leto who have portrayed the Joker in past movies and TV shows.Robert De Niro is excellent as TV show host Murray Franklin of whom Arthur Fleck idolises. Robert De Niro's character pays homage to his character in The King of Comedy (1983).Zazie Beetz (Deadpool) does a great job as Arthur's sympathetic neighbour of whom he befriends.Frances Conroy does well as Arthur's ailing mother who is also suffering a mental illness that may have been passed onto her troubled son.Many themes the movie explores include mental illness which is a major focus point throughout the movie as well as bullying, dealing with traumatic events, abuse, neglect, and failings of the government including unemployment, rising crime rates, and the broken medical system which take place in an alternate Gotham City.Joker also paid homage to the classic movie Taxi Driver (1976) also starring Robert De Niro who played the troubled anti-hero Travis Bickle who too, descended into self destructive behaviour, similar to Arthur Fleck's Joker.Intense, violent, shockingly realistic, and a chilling performance from Joaquin Phoenix left me lost for words long after the end credits rolled as I left the cinema. Joker was an amazing film and I can safely say that it is one of the best films of 2019.9/10"
5018,"As a person who actually went to the theaters, this was an amazing spectacle. To see a somewhat normal man descend into madness was amazing. The story was so tight as well and there weren't really any loopholes. I give this a 10/10 however the very beginning of the movie was a little disappointing to me."
5019,"This will become a cult movie, the performance of Joaquin Phoenix makes you feel sad, angry, scared and confused, all in one film."
5020,Joker was just amazing. It keeps you hooked from beginning to end. You can criticize that this movie will cause violence etc or you can just see it as the masterpiece it is. It's dark and develops jokers character beautifully. Joaquin Phenoix...you are just exceptional!
5021,"So many questions after came out from the cinema, have to go back and watch it again. Great movie"
5022,"Long time no see a great movie like this these days since The Revenant.
Highly recommend going to the theatre.
What a moviee!"
5023,"Joaquin Phoenix has outdone himself.
An amazing performance with an amazing direction.
This may be the best origin story for the joker.
The hard work of Joaquin Phoenix preparing for this role has paid off"
5024,"4 days after watching this film, I still feel it's impact, I cannot get it out of my head. The most perplexing, beautifully crafted & shot film of the Decade. This film, ""Joker"" will always be remembered. Joaquin's performance, the score, everything culminates perfectly. And by the end of the film. You will question your own Morals & Sanity. 10/10"
5025,I don't know was it really deserve oscar or not . But as acting is fantastic. Direction is perfect in every detail
5026,"All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy. That's how far the world is from where I am. Just one bad day.
The way Joaquin Phoenix handles Arthur Fleck from being oppressed to a lunatic, giving that amount of detail and depth to every subtle development of the character and let it thrive throughout the movie is just phenomenal to watch. Todd Phillips's JOKER is an instant classic."
5027,Waaaawwwwooooohhhhjjjjjjjjjjjjjjll this is amazing
5028,"It has been a very long time since I've had such a reaction to a movie, I even had to set my popcorn down from about 3 minutes in. In ways I hated watching this film, purely because I found it so incredibly uncomfortable to watch. For the majority of the movie I had tears in my eyes for the sympathy that I felt for Arthur Fleck, it was a completely new approach to the Joker and I have to say I felt things that I never thought I would feel for the character. Joaquin Phoenix definitely deserves the highest of praise for this genius performance, I found him heartbreaking and was overcome with emotion throughout the movie. I don't think that anyone else could have portrayed the character in such an amazing way. An absolute work of art."
5029,I went with my wife and usually i get restless at the cinema but didn't with this masterpiece and im actually think of going again to watch it or just wait to its on download.
5030,Wow. There wasn't a second in this movie i didn't like. The acting was incredible. The way the director and Leaf Phoenix presented the Joker's journey into insanity and at the same time confidence was just incredible. I can't remember in recent times leaving a movie and thinking about it for so long afterwards. I have to see it in theatres again.
5031,"The ""Joker"" offers a very deep insight into the chaotic mind of one of the most famous comic book villains of all-time.While the cartoon & later movies portray Joker as a lunatic who just enjoys causing agony to Batman,this movie is about a very different Joker.Right from the first scene there is something off about him.We soon find that he is lonely,disturbed & pretty much rejected by society.Arthur also suffers from some mental condition and the first half makes it quiet clear that he has a very poor understanding of people.Most notably when he laughs at the ""non funny"" moments of an act while he has no idea about the ""punch line"" when the rest of the public is laughing.Arthur has had nothing good happen to him in his life.The way he thinks & the way he functions is so different from anyone else that he's called a ""freak"".His only solace in this world is his mother who lives with him and loves him dearly.Arthur in turn is a good son who takes good care of his mom.All this takes place in an angry Gotham city.The general public feels cheated & rejected by the elites of the society.The class divide has taken a violent turn and things escalate when an elite decides to run for mayor.The protests soon turn into an all-out rebellion against the ""system"".However,the way the movie is edited things are not so straightforward.The edits happen at weird times to the point that the following scene has very little connection to anything else in the previous scene.Is this just Arthur imagining stuff? Has he even become the Joker or is he locked up in an asylum living a parallel delusive life? Or is this him reminiscing about Batman's childhood? Todd Phillips manages to make a cohesive movie while leaving us with these questions.""Joker"" borrows whole-heartedly from ""Taxi Driver"" & even ""King of Comedy"".The parallels are just too obvious.However,the movie is far less violent than ""Taxi Driver""(a 4 decade old movie!) Thus,it was baffling to me that it was so hysterically lambasted by critics for ""glorifying violence"" & what not.There is no such high volume gore or bloodshed here and I doubt anyone is going to go out & start killing people after seeing ""Joker""."
5032,"My hype for the movie since is first trailer had not let me down...This movie is a game changer for DC and the movie industries...
So dark yet so commendable and magnificent..
Really gets me thinking about the purpose of life."
5033,"This is a movie which really creates and portrays Arthur's journey from being a simple man into one of the most evil characters. Joaquin Phoenix is immense in this movie, the steps he takes to become what 'He' wants but is ultimately affected (negatively) by the environment he lives in. His life is severely impacted by the many events that unfold during the course of the movie and now I have a (somewhat) profound respect for the 'Joker'. This is an amazing portrayal of how chaos exists within every human being, which at the right moment explodes!!!This movie is not centered around the number of body counts, nor explosions or plots to kill certain individuals. This is about 'Arthur' and his life and how he becomes this 'Legend' of a character.Please watch this with an open mind and solely focus on the character rather than the plot which you would wish to see."
5034,"Perfect movie ,one of the best movies in this decade ,everything in this movie does make sense; soundtracks,direction,production,lightingAll of this makes you feel the movie atmosphere and the tragedy,depression in it
Acting is just perfect,and i t feels so real ,the storytelling is amazing and gradually show you how arthur becomes joker and it totally makes sense
Worth watching more than one time.
Oscar is waiting joaquin phoneix"
5035,Now that's what acting is all about.. super duper..
5036,"Joaquin Phoenix inhabits a troubled man who is pushed from the outside at no fault of his own into a psychosis emerging from the inside. His performance ranks as a masterpiece. I don't how one could pull this off and not go crazy himself. THIS is an ADULT movie which many viewers will find too grisly and disturbing. That's fine. I have a distaste for horror and mass killing films with rare exceptions like the The Sixth Sense. I almost walked out of The Kingsman. For Joker think the outrageously funny Deadpool without humor. Joker is a popcorn movie where no one eats the popcorn and which leaves no obvious moment for a quick bathroom break (I held on til the credits). Every scene progresses Arthur from a beaten down distressed person towards the ultimate evil Batman Villain. The infrequent however shocking violence has garnered msm controversy. I see the political side more so: how a disturbed yet alluring person in a severely distressed unjust society can rise as a symbol of violent hatred and heroism against that very system. History presents many examples, Mussolini comes to mind. My tagline would be 'Sociopaths are no joke.' Creepy stuff incredibly portrayed. Know what you're getting into and don't take kids. I would support an exclusive 18A rating, And Phoenix damn well better win the Oscar...."
5037,"Perfect play from the actor, it should definitely get the Oscar this year."
5038,Very good movie
5039,"Joker is something different for the comic book genre, but in a good way. The film is fantastic in terms of story, acting, design and cinematography that make it another one of the best films in said genre that is on the same level as The Dark Knight. Joaquin Phoenix in the role of Arthur Fleck/Joker is outstanding! The supporting cast's acting are very well done. The last 20 minutes of this film is amazing and terrifying at the same time, it's just that good. Don't miss out your chance to see this film on the big screen, go see it!"
5040,"Ayyy, that's pretty good."
5041,"This is the kind of movie you won't ever forget. Joaquin Phoenix delivers an amazing and uneasy performance, this one is a must watch."
5042,"After a long while, a movie without fake feeling, without fancy special effects, a perfect music production and real play by actors. This movie will get many awards and definitely the best actor and best music"
5043,I've never enjoyed and got immersed in a movie as much as I did with the Joker. The actor deserves an Oscar and the movie deserves being watched at least twice.
5044,"Joker is both shocking and provoking while still being chillingly realistic. This is an applausing psychological/social analysis and demonstration. It feels so real, that's why it feels so horrifying. The unexpected storyline along with Joaquin's excellent acting combined is definitely worth 4.5/5. However, I recommend that you be prepared and bring a serious mindset when watching this film, because it is quite graphically disturbing in a very realistic way that it reminds me of the mass murder cases in real life. I have a headache ever since I walked out of the cinema, I must say...."
5045,"I think I just watched the movie of the year. Incredible acting, great attention to detail, and excellent cinematography. There wasn't one minute I wanted to look away. I hope JP wins the Oscar for this performance, and the rest of the cast & crew get their awards too. They must be proud of this body of work."
5046,One of the masterpeice i have seen after Taxi Driver (1976).
5047,"I'm not sure I can add anything that hasn't already been mentioned, but I was so thrilled to see Joaquin use every cell in his body to give us this twisted and broken antihero. The climactic scene was so beautiful and choreographed impeccably. Diamonds from coal. Gave me chills. Can't wait to see it again."
5048,Excellent acting and portrayal of the joker which is
5049,"The best Joker i ever see! backsound, act, cinematic, PERFECT!"
5050,"#JokerCaution: The slow burning schizophrenic emancipation of Arthur Fleck will leave you deeply disturbed, mouth agape in some scenes of pure violence, shocking you to the core.Arthur's fall into insanity is like quicksand. It will pull you along with Arthur down the rabbit's hole. You could try and walk out of the theatre but I doubt you will be able to move.For comicbook fans, Arthur Fleck eventually became the Joker, the one man who could not be moved, the one man who saw the evil in everyone. The one man who knew how to push even the White Knights into darkness, while he danced with the Devil in the pale moonlight (!) laughing away in his own terrible pain, his own deep frustrations, his own madness...This movie is about the final leap he took. The leap into sheer madness. You will become mad along with him. So compelling is this portrayal of the Joker.You could blame the apathy of a dying society for the final push. You could blame his mother. You could blame his colleagues.But in the end, Arthur doesn't blame anyone. Not even the demons in his head.By the end of it all, he learns to dance with them...You can see him do that dance in the end, without saying a word. His deep mad eyes speak it out as if he's shouting it in your face.It will shake you up. It will make you cry.Because you and I, are a part of the Society that drove Arthur to become the Joker...I have never been so disturbed by a movie. I've seen some of the most horrific movies as part of my quest for understanding cinema.This movie is a first. It brings tears to my eyes to write this. You will feel sad for Arthur's madness, twist your heart with the pain he felt.But you will also feel the sheer murderous horror that Arthur becomes. Like an Antichrist rising from the fires of our collective apathy and the death of our tired souls.P. S. To sit through this movie took all of my love for cinema. I have never been so much in awe, ever."
5051,I was skeptical about this movie because I though it would be too difficult to give justice to the character of Joker comparing it to the amazing performance of Heath Ledger. But Joaquin managed to do that remarkably.I didn't find the movie disturbing and I love every bit of it. This is by far one of the best movies I've seen.
5052,"In a world where mindless super hero films, reboots, and bad remakes dominate Hollywood, it leaves a lot to be desired. When you actually find all great let alone a good film at times it's like wining a few hundred bucks. Joker for me shows there is hope.Now, anyone that went into this film not knowing it was a dark, character study clearly didn't watch the trailers or read up on it, or they would know it's a backstory film that's going to be an obvious slow burn before the inevitable. Clearly, people just assumed it's called Joker so it's all Joker. Nope not by a long shot. Next time watch the trailers and read.The story revolves around Arthur Fleck who is a wannabe comedian and semi-professional clown. Arthur does not have much luck in life let alone much to look forward to. On a side note, he's also mentally ill but many of us are so we move along the best we can.Unfortunately for Arthur, he has a lot of bad luck in life to which he starts to crumble a bit. Later on he feels a couple of daggers that change and affect him tremendously, which results in a downward spiral resulting in The Joker or in reality Joker.The film is very dark and set around 1981 before one of its biggest influences Martin Scorsese's King of Comedy came out. It's also heavily influenced by Scorsese's Taxi Driver with shades of Clockwork Orange and even Network. It pays off.Joaquin Phoenix further proves or just put the nail in the coffin for anyone that he is the best actor currently working today in delivering an electrifying performance much worthy of an Oscar.Phillips shows he is a real filmmaker with this film and also shows he's a student of 70s cinema when anything was possible. Easily one of the best of the year, if not the best."
5053,"Phoenix and Phillips deliver a singular Joker in a positive way. They tell an origin story of how badly resolved personal and psychological issues, plus a decaying model of society along with self-pity, have turned an unbalanced man into the greatest villain of all time."
5054,"Was completely mesmerized by Phoenix's performance in this film. Absolutely astounding, he had me eating out of the palm of his hand. He boldly emoted every nuance of the central character, using a very Method technique. Physically, he obviously lost a great deal of weight. His face is all sharp angles and eyes, perfect for his many close ups. His body looks lithe, nearly skeletal, which is showcased in scenes of him bent, writhing, and dancing. The costuming makes great use of Phoenix's height and weight, clothing him in tight, tall lines and going from ragged, dreary everyday thrift shop clothing to the eventual final appearance in the Joker's familiar suited attire, in it's garish colors of blood and dirt.Phoenix speaks perhaps 15 minutes of full dialogue in this performance, but he uses his face, his entire body, to communicate to the audience every moment of his character's state of mind. The audience is captivated as he shows us, not tells us, exactly what Arthur is experiencing. His is a bleak tale of madness and woe. Arthur's alter-ego, the Joker, embodies his incarnation as 'The Lord of Chaos', spinning deeper and deeper into insanity and anarchy with the audience held captive. Until we, like Arthur, aren't sure what is real and what is fantasy anymore.I'm totally perplexed as to media reviews that are concerned that the public may be somehow compelled to violence as a result of this film. No sane person will be compelled to rise in anarchy against the rich or against the government because they see Joker. Joker states in the film by reason of explanation, that he does what he does out of DESPAIR against humanity's capabilities to be mean to one another. He just wants everyone to get along. ""Why can't you just be...NICE?!"" The story of this film, as I saw it, was the story of how one person succumbs to insanity finally, after a life of horrific abuse and abject poverty. Yes, I felt bad for the character. Do I condone the violence that the Joker perpetuates in the film because of his circumstances? No, I didn't. No reasonably sane person will either. All it will take is one nutjob stating he committed some terrible act, for this film to be wrongfully attributed to causing mayhem and be dismissed entirely wrongfully from the Oscar picks it deserves: Best Director, Best Actor, Best Sound, Best Cinematography."
5055,"I expected the sadness factor to overcome any brilliance of the movie, but brilliance won. Wheels within wheels, haven't had my mind whirl on conjectures since ""No Country for Old Men."" DeNiro was excellent and accentuated the association/influence of Taxi Driver. Phoenix was...simply was...Joker. Overall... GREAT Only ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"" tops this movie this year to my mind."
5056,"It's all in the laugh. It's such a fresh take on why joker became joker. I actually ended up sympathizing for him. All my life I was led to believe Thomas Wayne was a good man. There were soo many instances I felt he could change society, having money and power. Joker showed us the other side of the coin. And he is an illegitimate son of Thomas Wayne!! Dayum. The best part is l liked the way the uncertainty is shown, maybe he is insane, maybe there was a cover up from the Wayne's. What a performance, the music is phenomenal. Darkness embraced."
5057,"My goodness, the people that play joker always wants to one up each other. Phoenix was insanely good portraying him. From his movements, laughing, dancing, mannerisms, it was very believable. This is a guy that put everything into the role. Add the haunting music in certain scenes just make it that much more distubring. Movie was depressing, but the acting was next level."
5058,"As a full pledged Batman fan (ESPECIALLY the animated series), my favorite villian has always been the joker...
Jack N was my favorite personification because he captured the ""clowness"" part of him...
I respected Heith L acting... but, he was NOT the Joker. He was too dark, to somber... too Emo.
But THIS movie wowed me!!
I dont know the kind of reaserch he did (if any) to portray him. But Joaquin Pheonix managed to capture all the key elements of the Joker in a way that makes it real yet maintaing the clown part. I can swear I see features/aspects or scenes from the animated series but grounded to a real life scenario... what would it look like if he was real? It cant be funny funny... he is a psicopath and a killer, but he thinks its all a joke.
Those easter eggs that only I saw, like a ""its just a joke!""... ""sometimes people just dont get it"".
Plus more references made that justified obsessions...
His acting was AMAZING... you can feel his pain and desperation and why he would go crazy and hide behind his clown persona... and you pitty and fear him.
I could SO believe a Harleen Quinzel fall for Joaquin's Joker. NOT that gangster pimp ridiculous attempt.
Even if you are not a Batman fan and don't know or care about the story... you have to recognize the acting. It is a powerfull drama...
And if you are a fan, you have to recognize that he manages to ground him to a real life portrayal while maintaining the comicality of the fact that he ""is"" funny or tries & thinks he is.. a psicopathic clown."
5059,"Prior Note:Alright before starting anything here, I want to clear that, though the character is taken from the DCverse, this movie is a completely independent take on his origin, through the eyes of Writer Scott Silver and the Director, Todd Phillips.What puts a ""smile"" on faces? (The Goods of the movie)First and foremost, the acting. Phoenix has always chosen gritty, dark and complex roles, but this one? he just hit it out of the goddamn park! His portrayal of a disturbed man, trying to make the ends meet but, by getting cynical and darker with each passing moment is so sad and surreal, that the audience feels every bit of emotion he goes through. Take a bow to this legend named, Joaquin 'bad-ass' Phoenix. Best Actor Oscar, someone's gonna get you!Second is the writer's and director's vision, of how to enact this dystopian society of shrude riches, and how they malnourish the growth of unprivileged. In my opinion, Joker is not a tale of a mentally and socially disturbed man, to take out violence as the only route to gain back his lost confidence, but the tale of how broken a society can get, how capitalism seeps in each and everyone of us, and how a commoner usually feels, when betrayed and mocked, just for not being in a zone, where he/she can afford, of what the privileged ones can""They expect you to behave, as if you don't."" when Arthur writes these lines in his diary, he sums up the whole movie. Joker is almost everyone who is helpless. Be politically, economically or socially. Some one who has lost faith in this system. Someone who is tired with all the personal and public problems. Trying to find solace and distractions, but not finding recognition until he steps in a darker side.Third, is the neo-noir screenplay, an adaptation of Taxi Driver (1976) vibes to build the still-born ""Crime Prince of Gotham"", and insane references to the Wayne family. The film's narrator (Arthur Fleck) is unreliable, and that is what the character of Joker is, a living joke. A mystery.What went into the chemical boiler(The Bads of the film)The 2 problems, i have with this movie is the ambiguity in their depiction of mental health. On one side, where mental health and neurological wellness should be treated in utter lightness and calm, here's a movie, though all in right intentions, depicted violence as a 'way' to get out of your mental illness. The path-breaking changes in Arthur's visibly fragile personality took a drastic makeover, but when he went into the purgotary of committing heinous crimes. That's one question that the makers should address. Is answer to all the palpable mental conditions, is voilence?Another issue, is that the film is totally based on a personal theory of 'how it might have been', which creates a tonne of loopholes for the existing batverse. Though all of the developments were strikingly new and innovative, but people who are die-hard batverse and DC comics fans, might have some time to digest some part of the movie.Third, is how sad, gritty, dark and pale it gets. Its nothing BAD, that's how the movie progresses. In my personal vendetta, i suffered from sheer sadness and gloomy-ness for atleast 2 hours, when i went out of the theatre. Though its a good thing that the makers have established what they wanted to, but again, this movie is a hard cup of tea, and surely, not for everyone to drink.Heath Ledger V/s Joaquin Pheonix: The better Joker?Heath Ledger, the late legend, who gave Joker, his symbolical meaning, to be honest, has nothing to be compared with Phoenix's portrayal .Ledger's joker was bold, a symbol of anarchy, whereas Phoenix's was a fragile man, who just wanted a stage of his own, but it all went in a dreary way. Both of them, are different worlds, but same intention. They think themselves of a breeze to underprivileged, a naxalite ideology, with a pinch of glamour, and fan-fic! And both of them, are BRILLIANT. SHEER PROWESS!ConclusionAs the credits rolled, I just have these lines to say. Joker, with all of its problem, is a cinematic masterpiece, because to be a 'problem' was the first and foremost goal the makers wanted to achieve. When we as an audience, will go through an array of disembarment and problems with the movie, only then we can connect with, what Arthur went through before he became 'The Joker!""9 out of 10 for this cinematic brilliance!"
5060,"Joker is a R Rated psycho thriller which the world has never seen before. The movie follows the tragic events in Arthur Fleck's life which ultimately turn him into the Joker. It is a thrill ride filled with mixed emotions and is a bit too disturbing at some places. Joquain Phoenix is the heart of the movie and has delivered a splendid performance which is worthy of an Oscar. The background music has a greater part in the movie which intensifies the nature of the scenes when ever necessary. The supporting cast including Robery De Niro,Bret Cullen,Francs Conroy have provided satisfying performances adding to the beauty of the movie.Todd Phillips direction is praise worthy and the cinematography of the movie is truely mind blowing.The climax of the movie is something which cannot be defined in words and is worth goosebumps.On the whole Joker is a movie which felt to have no relation to DC comics but is brilliantly connected to one of DC's most iconic event by the climax.It is a one time experience which is not to be missed in theatres.Thank U Todd,Joquain And WB For such a wonderful experience."
5061,"Crazy can be so captivating ..Descent into chaos could be so devastatingly brutal ..This is an origin story that is deeply affecting as it delves into the depths of a psyche of one of the most complex characters from the comics universe - Arthur Fleck aka Joker.It might be natural for us - as the the viewers - to empathise with the predicament of Arthur Fleck - a lonely, failing stand-up comedian - as he is pushed down a slippery slope of insanity through repeated assault of rejections. His sorry state of existence is brought to stark relief when we learn that something as benign and banal as laughter is accessible to him only through a medical condition.However, if we dig a little deeper .. it becomes quite scary when we realise that this a neither remote nor an imperfect reflection of the times and climes that we inhabit. Director Todd Phillips might have set this movie in the early 80's. But, make no mistake... This is a movie for our times .. In fact, this is a commentary on our very own turbid times. A dire warning on the dehumanising influences that have engulfed us in the form of an irrepressible contagion of indifference towards ""the others"".We, as a society, are unapologetically harsh on those faceless forgettables and indifferent to their sensibilities. Their needs and dreams are continuously crushed under our collective disdain and an ever rising tsunami tide of our insatiable wants. Consequently, the less fortunate majority are forced to flee and dwell on the very margins of our society as we continuously push them ever more further to the edges of their very existence and quite often, even beyond. The rousing finale gives us glimpses of what could be in store if the dispossessed decide to decry and dethrone the dispensation that denies them the chance of decent existence.Joaquin Phoenix pours his heart and soul into the emaciated frame of Arthur Fleck and owns every speck of this character's crazy mind space that is a spectacularly chaotic mess. His is a phenomenal performance that captures the journey of Arthur's deep seated vulnerability, inner angst, earnest yearning for acceptance, agony in the face of repeated rejections, frustration at his failures and humiliations, sudden eruptions of bloody violence all the way into the finale of uncontrollable chaos. This is a performance that is in the realm of pure artistry and every bit award worthy. The sombre score and the dark hued framing magnify the melancholy mood that permeates the movie.A little over a decade ago, Heath Ledger had totally owned this part as a formidable adversary to the batman in The Dark Knight and elevated that movie to stratospheric heights. In the process, he earned a well deserved Oscar and left a permanent imprint on our minds. To aspire going beyond that stupendous performance and redefining Joker is an audacious endeavour - an adventure in itself. And, after watching Joker, one would concede that director Todd Phillips and his leading man have succeeded to pull off this unlikely feat - a true mission impossible in the realm of cinema - and to add to that, have done it with aplomb and gusto.If The Revenant was the physically taxing penance of Leonardo DiCaprio which brought him awards glory, Joker is Joaquin's deep meditation on exploring the rapidly unravelling universe of Arthur Fleck's messed up mind and is certain to fill his trophies chest.The beleaguered DCU and WB have another winner here that has been forged in the darkest of realms. The scenes where Arthur comes across the Waynes - both senior and junior - are loaded with intrigue, pregnant with possibilities that could herald healthy augurings for the reboot of the Batman franchise. If only they could flesh out a worthy caped crusader to take on this Joker, it would be a delectable entertainment. Amen.Joker is utterly dark and is unquestionably disturbing .. Nevertheless, it is an engrossing watch that grabs your attention with a brilliant performance and holds an unflinching mirror to all of us to reflect upon.A DARK TOUR DE FORCE ! A TRIUMPH !!"
5062,I am speechless. This movie is beyond good. So important for today's society. Joaquin Phoenix is an absolute performance genius. I cannot wait to watch this film again and again.
5063,"I'm a big fan of the DC comic universe and Joker has always been one of my favorite bad guys. This is not that Joker.This story is totally stand alone as Joker from the comics has never been given a back story.Don't expect too much action here, the movie isn't about that, it's all about Jokers decent into madness.The hype around this movie I think is just part of it's advertising as there is nothing in this movie that's ""hyper violent"" or anything that graphic really. He kills a total of 6 people in the entire movie, 4 with a gun, one stabbing/head smashing into wall and one smothering. I laughed at the ""news"" stories about people walking out of the movie being sick...I'm not sure where those stories come from. I recently saw John Wick 3 and the violence in that movie is hundreds of times what this movie is. In fact I would even call the violence in this movie pretty tame by today's standards.The star of this movie is of course Joaquin's acting. The depths he goes to play this kind of insanity is astounding. Giving the Joker the strange laughing mental illness was a great idea. Think tourettes but instead of swearing and ticks he laughs, it's really clever.During the movie I actually felt for him, he gets pushed around so much I was almost cheering when he shot the bullies on the train.It's a great story, slow, yes, but very compelling and I didn't feel bored throughout the movie.I'm not sure about the top user review on this page as he calls it the best film to bring a comic book to life - it's not based on any comic book. Also using the words disturbing and violent feels a bit much, it's not that bad...Oh and the way Joker runs is fantastic, he runs a lot in this movie and it's just funny to watch."
5064,10/10 must watch.
5065,"I'm writing this right after my first viewing, but when I say this, I absolutely mean it. This movie will blow your mind. It is like a car crash. You literally can't look away. Everything about it was done so well, from the score to the plot and everything in between. Just wow. I can definitely see why people have and will have problems with this movie, but it serves as a social commentary that shouldn't be ignored."
5066,This movie is pretty good. By comparison most movies are crap. It gives a good portrayal of someone slipping through the cracks. It is NOT as good as some reviews are saying. Phoenix was actually much more mesmerizing in You Were Never Really There.
5067,"""Joker"" takes us to a mentally ill, underprivileged person' world. We experience cruel, judgmental and selfish people in the society. I loved the message that this movie is trying to deliver: we should take care of those who are unable to take care of themselves.
It wasn't even important if Brett Cullen was actually Phoenix's father or not. He was responsible for him, either as a father, or as a powerful, influential character. We need to realize that those who are born in underprivileged families, or those who are traumatized in young ages, and are not able to cope with a ""normal"" society must be taken care of."
5068,Phoenix nails the Arthur Fleck character and all its crazy. This movie is the backstory of how Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker. Its a drama/psychological thriller NOT an action/comic-like movie. Joaquin Phoenix should get an Oscar for this performance.
5069,I loved this movie 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
5070,"This movie is not about 'how much action can we cram into one sitting', rather, it is about the slow build up of a truly twisted character. Arthur's character is the sole focal point during the entire film, allowing the audience to live through his backstory with no interruptions. The music, dancing, and crude laughter draws you into the world of Arthur, and eventually, the Joker. With that being said, the transformation into the Joker is a very intense and occasionally bloody journey; but, every step of this process has meaning behind it and nothing seemed overly done, or out of place. Some scenes are very dark, but the backstory leading up to them makes them even more impactful when witnessing them on the screen.
I wouldn't know what the correct category for this movie is, but it hits hard in the psychological department as you watch this character's mind explode out of its shell by the end."
5071,"....nothing short of amazing. Absolutely an academy award winning performance, despite anyone's opinion of the story line.....Like Marmite, you can love it or hate it, but Phoenix's acting ability deserves the HIGHEST marks"
5072,"I never thought I'd become a fan of the joker but the movie was a masterpiece. It touched on many societal issues and the story unfolded just perfectly. Phoenix's acting was brilliant. Every scene was just beautiful and even the killing was depicted in an aesthetic way. Kudos to Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix.For the mainstream critics who think this movie is somehow controversial, instead of blaming movies and video games for potential shooting, think about what really has been happening in our society that pushes people off the edge to do crazy things like that. I think you guys can learn a great lesson from the movie Joker."
5073,"This movie dramatizes the sad story of Arthur's mental anguish in which he asks people to call him Joker. He was the victim of abuse in his family, in his employment, and his intimate relationships. He was aware of personal health issues, but he was persistently trying to use his mental problems to his advantage. He was desperately trying to be funny in all kinds and circumstances which resulted in a terrible major realization in a subway accident. Joker was bound by his dreams (or delusions - depending on the viewer's perspective) and his vision of justice. The movie allows the audience to feel the hurt of Joker and horrible consequences of his actions. All artistic tools and contributions involved in this movie make this story full of anxiety and depression. This movie is a perfect companion for autumn melancholy and bad Halloween memories."
5074,"So Joker just hit theaters with a whopping amount of money being brought in for the studio during the first weekend.I don't know where to start when talking about this movie, so let's just start with the details. Joker is a movie about a psychopath in the making. It shows how a man suffering from a mental illness was transformed into the clown prince of crime that we all know now as the infamous joker. He has an uncontrollable condition of laughing at the wrong moments.The next point that I am going to make is about the reality of this movie. I believe that this movie was a call for gun violence bans, because it shows that in the wrong hands a gun can be very powerful. This was also a reality call in the sense that mental illness patients are not cared for as much as we should be caring for them, in other words say someone has physical damage everyone's gathering around them and supporting them but when someone has a mental illness they are isolated away from most people.Next up was the violence in this movie. Now the movie wasn't heavy on it but when it was there, there was a lot of blood. What made it worse was when the music playing made it feel suspenseful.After that, there was the feeling you felt when watching this movie. I am not going to lie to you this is a depressing movie, it is sad and he gets constantly beat up whether it's mentally or physically. It is sad and disheartening to see.Next is the director and actors. I believe Todd Phillips did a terrific job when directing this movie, he made it fit in with the comic book origins but still maintained a point of gun violence control. In my opinion he chose a stellar cast. Joaquin Phoenix was one of the best joker actors and, in my opinion, I thought he was one of the best actors, I thought he was at or better than Heath Ledger's portrayal of the ionic character. Another actor that was good in this was Robert De Niro when he represented a character that acted like the late night host Johnny Carson, Robert was outstanding in this movie.A movie that was like this. One of the movies that they brought in to portray this movie, Taxi Driver had the same gritty feel. Don't get me wrong both movies are really good but I believe joker was better.Finally my opinion of it. I believe anyone who just likes a good suspense movie should go watch this. It had a really good plot (not easy to follow, because joker imagines stuff), it had a massive play twists and it was just an overall good movie I would rate it a 10/10, best movie of the year. I am excited to see what the future holds for this version of the joker.Spoiler alert for the next section...My theory of what the ending meant. I believe that the joker was telling the story of the movie to the therapist at the end. He believed that he was the ""Savior"" that everyone needed, to bring laughter and joy to the world. In an allusion I believe Gotham was a Dynamite stick and joker was the fuse."
5075,Hr movie is on another level .. just marvelous aaaaaaaahhh
5076,"This film is 90% Arthur Fleck and 10% Joker. That is not a bad thing because the facts are so organic as they unfold, this becomes the Joker backstory that you never knew you needed.
I'm a huge fan of both of Tim Burton's Batman films, & who doesn't love Jack Nickolson? But this Joker gets moved to the front of all the lines, and makes Heath Ledger's J look contrived.
I was never a fan of his interpretation.
Let's not even mention the one-who-shall-not-be-named in the most recent J in Suicide Squad. Trash. Complete trash.And, if you're a fan of Villain Dances like I am, this one is EPIC. It is awkward in the most real & vulnerable way and then rises to Mick Jagger perfection at the pinnacle.
Conflict & incongruity are what makes the villain dances so mesmerizing. My benchmark has always been creepy Mr Blond from Res Dogs when he's gleefully torturing the street cop, but Sam Rockwell always steals any show with his style anytime he's fulfilling his bad guy rolls. Joaquin and his villain dance aren't so forthright, it takes a few tries and he doesn't get it right every time, that's what makes the scene on the stairs so powerful & almost orgasmic. It's a glimpse into what his complete transformation will look like once he's embraced his alter ego, fully.
There's some other fun facts? that will shake up the DC Universe if you pay attention to details.
This film will absolutely be triggering to anyone who has suffered abuse, neglect, bullying, apathy from ppl supposed to help, or just downright inhumane treatment.
Send in the Clowns."
5077,"Just got home from watching the movie and I must say it was a breathtakingly triumphant body of work. The layers within the film, the character development and the homage to ""King of Comedy"" was very clever indeed.
Joaquin was brilliant but a lot must be said for the rest of the casting. Some really good choices for sure. And surprising at that.
The only thing I felt was either remarkably purposefully dark or somehow overlooked was the choice of Gary Glitter's ""Rock & Roll Pt 2"" as one of the soundtracks. Great song and fitted perfectly with the era but it isn't without some baggage.
Besides that, i cant wait to see it again very soon. A masterpiece."
5078,"Never did I expect ""Joker"" to have the impact on me it did! I went in expecting a grandiose, dark and twisted character study with a top notch lead performance and came out richly rewarded with that and so much more. Not only does ""Joker"" provide us with a unique take on the origins of The Joker, it also provides us with an in-depth character study on mental illness and the corrupt, narcissistic and anarchic society we all live In, but some of whom struggle to see, through their rose-tinted glasses!
.
The most important message I received which really hit me hard due to my own experiences with mental health and my own somewhat troubled past is the fact that anyone one of us could of potentially been or still could be a semblance of ""The Joker,"" and Todd Phillips has, with this film, presented us with an articulate presentation on what personal trauma could possibly turn someone into the joker and what little is done to prevent such terrible things from unfolding.
.
I cannot help but think, wow, what if my life turned out like that, what if I went through all that pain and suffering, because it's real, this stuff has actually happened and is still happening all over the world. What kind of person would I of turned into? There's only so much a person can take before they snap, and once they do, could you really blame that person for breaking? Especially when the world is already broken. And when society shuns you to the side without listening, helping, supporting or caring, it's just like setting off a ticking-time-bomb, placing it in a busy crowd and then just waiting until it explodes.
.
Let's be honest, people don't want to understand or actually help, some are too scared to accept it and some are too up their own asses to even realise, and then when you finally feel brave enough to try and get medical help, they're just quick to label you with some sort of ""mental illness,"" feed you some crap about how to ""get better,"" prescribe you some meds and then send you on your way, most don't even care about knowing why you're actually feeling like this, and if they don't like what they hear or you're ""too broken,"" they're quick to lock you up without bothering to find the true source of the pain and the actual cause or causes of said issues.
.
I'm not ashamed to say, there were times during this film where tears flooded my eyes due to the pain of Arthur Fleck. It truly broke my heart seeing, nay feeling what he was going through with no help at all, in-fact, quite the opposite; every kick in the gut was quickly followed up with more kicks to the gut, it is not a light story! The screenplay is constantly real, raw and quotable, constantly asking questions that really make you think. The score is riveting and definitely a highlight of the film, every chord that was struck shook me to my core, the soundtrack is pitch-perfect and the cinematography was beautiful and atmospheric.
.
There are truly no words for Joaquins performance, I was and still am completely blown away by his physical transformation and the authenticity of his character. Every scene he's in, just the look of his tormented face and his haunted expressions has you on the edge of your seat, terrified to find out what's going to happen next. How he manages to capture the true essence of Arthur's pain in one single laugh is absolutely harrowing and his delivery of every single line is venomous and of the utmost importance! If he's not atleast nominated for an Oscar, chaos will ensue, just like it did here!
.
The supporting performances where all perfect; they helped express the intensity and severity of the storyline and Joaquin's central performance. The brutality of this film is needed and personally all of the BS circulating this film is unwarranted. You cannot blame a film for potentially influencing violence because of its brutal and dark nature when it's giving a raw depiction of our world we live in now and when one of its main objectives is to shed a little light on what society could/should do to prevent these situations from ever happening. Everyone should see this film for the multiple insightful messages it provides, Joaquin's (fingers-crossed) oscar winning performance and Todd Phillips' unflinching direction! Must See!"
5079,"I have read a lot of reviews about this film commenting on the cinematography and the music (haunting) and the outstanding direction (Phillips) and acting (Phoenix) but none has expressed how utterly heartbreaking Phoenix's portrayal of a grown man who has suffered child abuse and neglect is - it is physically painful to watch - utterly beautiful and heartbreaking. I felt as if I'd taken him home with me after the film; his all consuming embodiment of the tortured man who is Arthur Fleck attaches itself to you like a needy animal and doesn't let go for days. And then only reluctantly. How he manages this is mesmerising. The violence in the film is gratuitous but feels inevitable and 'justified' given how he has suffered. It is of course coming from a sociopath who so clearly has been created by the neglect of a mother who suffered from mental illness, herself. The violence he inflicts is the manifestation of the utter rage and emptiness he feels. Phoenix lives this onscreen. This is what is so utterly devastating, exhausting, colossal and enveloping about his embodiment of Arthur . And it is an embodiment, not a performance. It's too real to be a performance.
I totally agree with another reviewer who says that if you're not willing to develop you're own thoughts about the subject in a film as dark and vast as this - watch something else. You'll feel it physically but you're brain will try to process what you've just been through, so be prepared.
Utterly transfixed was I for the ENTIRE film. Life changing. And utter kudos to the director and lead actor who were not afraid to show us mental illness and it's heartbreaking affects (extreme though they may be, here) and it's legacy, in all it's deep, dark relentlessness."
5080,"This movie is worth all the praise.
Perfect display from Joaquim.
Certainly DC comics savior."
5081,"In the dark and crime ridden streets of Gotham, Batman may be fighting for justice, but the Joker is waging his own war. The way he sees it, the Joker considers himself the hero of his story; a world that is naturally prone to violence and chaos and he's the only one who finds the joke of it. Also unlike Batman who dresses in black to use the darkness to his advantage, the Joker is bright and colorful to not only be seen, but to be the star of his crime show. This is what makes the dynamic of these two the ultimate hero versus villain setup.Most people know Batman's story of his parents slain which makes him want to stop others from having the same tragic events, but what about the Joker? When you really think about it, the movies have not tackled the backstory of the clown prince of crime. Batman and The Dark Knight certainly gives you an idea of their psychopathic characters, but not their roots. The closest we got was The Killing Joke graphic novel, which is still a critically phrased story. With Joker, we now see if film can deliver a worthy background.In the early eighties in Gotham, a lonely man Arthur Fleck (played by Joaquin Phoenix) is trying his hardest to ""bring joy and laughter to the people of Gotham"" by working as a clown for hire and aspires to be a stand up comedian. He also suffers a neurological condition that causes him to laugh at random moments. Though he's told to ""put on a happy face"" by his mother Penny (played by Frances Conroy), the city's high crime and decay from graffiti and rats only make things worse for him. In fact, he finds that due to budget cuts, he won't be able to get any more medication to treat his problems.While dressed as a clown, he gets into an incident where three people that work for Thomas Wayne get killed, several people in Gotham see him as a symbol to go after the wealthy establishment. Since nobody knows it was Arthur, he carries on with his standup. A botched performance ends up on the TV show of Murray Franklin (played by Robert De Niro), who invites the latter to explain. As the city seems to be hitting a boiling point of anger, combined with more problems for Arthur, he starts to realize just what kind of clown he is.Joker is inspired by a lot of Martin Scorsese movies like Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy. While I don't know if it reaches the same heights, I still enjoyed Joker a lot...or as much as you can get out of this kind of story. The first half of the movie really stands on it's own about a guy whose already broken and is getting worse by a world that doesn't seem to be listening. Despite some reports, I don't think were supposed to sympathize with this guy, even though we do see everything that happens to him, and can imagine why a guy like this would end up doing the things he does.It works well thanks to Joaquin Phoenix who pulls off one of his great performances. A lot like De Niro in The King of Comedy, he starts off as a bit off, but not dangerous until he's pushed to his limit. But as I said, the movie does have him as the main character, but not one your supposed to side with. His evil deeds have merit within his mind and you understand why, especially after his scenes with his mother, other clowns, Thomas Wayne, and even De Niro.The first half before he transforms is phenomenal. The second half is where things start to slip. It's not because it isn't good, but the tone does start to shift back into comic book territory. A lot of it comes when it makes it's connections to the Wayne family that the movie didn't need. It's easy to ignore a large chunk of that as the final movie was still satisfying. If I had any other problems, it would be that there are several spots where things could have ended upon. I won't spoil it, but get ready to think that the movie is going to end only to go on another ten minutes.I'll give this eight clown noses out of ten. In terms of it's story, Joker does make for a good psychological look at the famous Batman villain."
5082,Ignore the negative reviews this film is incredible. After i left the cinema i was speechless for a full 20 minutes because of how much of a deep effect it had on me. It linked into The Dark Knight (one of my favourite films) beautifully and Waqouim Pheonix's performance was simply phenomenal and i would be suprised he does not win an oscar for his outsatnding acting. He fit the role perfectly. I would rate this film 8.8 stars out of 10 and want to see it on imdb's top rated list.
5083,"In my opinion the purpose of making this joker a film so that people's minds are open, can see it from different sides / perspectives. There is no film that justifies / teaches if the murder is true, it is not possible to teach revenge which is the right thing. So the goal here is how we treat ourselves for other people / people suffering from this disease. while Arthur was on the Murray Franklin show he said 'Thomas Wayne doesn't know that people can be wild' wild which means here are those who don't get justice and want to vent their anger. So my conclusion is that crime not only comes from people's desires but can also be caused by accidental or unwillingness of people about it but only wants to respond accordingly. that's why religion is important. And the creation of the Joker character is due to the people who created their own demons"
5084,"This is a very different/ perhaps disappointing movie for all those who seek simple-fast-action- slashing & superpowers. ( See some of the low ratings)
This movie is about real life sadness, fragility and coping with that. This is not a about the cold blooded super villain, (yet) The one who blows up buildings and burns you all. Oh and without machine guns or cgi fake stuff. But due to that the most dangerous of all.
This is a gritty psychological drama. I am hoping for an elaborate picture of this character.
This was exactly what the comic movie genre needed! A story of a kind man, whose life is ridden with sadness and bad luck. Instead of having superpowers or all the money in the world.
Its about coping, system flaws and realizing what may become of that.
Yes, we are all rooting for him now! Don't we?
I Loved Arthur and this is one of the better movies i have seen in past years. Please bring more of this.
Well done !"
5085,"Amazingly filmed, felt like I was there witnessing the main character development. Only reason no 9 or 10 is due to how disturbing the movie could be interpreted. Excellent music and a really nice portrayal of the Joker."
5086,"It is gem of cinema, Far better than any other Superhero action drama. Congratulations Todd Phillips and joaquin phoenix for this masterpiece. 😍😍😍😍😍"
5087,I have been patiently waiting for this to arrive.....I am not disappointed at all! Joaquin was simply AMAZING! You really feel for his character and I did cheer for him in the end. I loved everything about this movie. He made Joker his own but also honored all of those who have played him in the past! It would be wonderful to see Batman in this world!
5088,"Joker has established itself again with it solo badass movie.The acting of Joaquin Phoenix was stunning.It depicts the true sorrow of commeners of society during economic distress.Don't miss a chance to visit your Pscho Joker in the nearest Cinemas.
Is he a villian or a hero ?
Decide for yourself."
5089,"I dont want to say much, but after watching the movie in cinema, i still cant shake the thoughts about Joker off my mind. I even watch the trailers everyday, it's something very moving about the movie. It moved me.
I have never felt this much compassion and deep sorrow and empathy towards ANY villain in any other movies.
This movie deserves MANY WINS."
5090,The conflict the cast the story the whole thing is a maximum drama and sycho
5091,"Just got back home from seeing this a second time. I loved it even more. I say this with no exaggeration... This film is a masterpiece. Please go see it, but be prepared for some heavy material. This is a very real exploration of a psychopathic killer. It is extremely violent, and often hard to watch, but always with a purpose. Joaquin Phoenix is unbelievable. He disappears completely into this character. The evolution we see this tortured man go through would have fallen flat with a lesser actor in the role. Luckily, Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant. On the technical end, this film is beautifully shot and Todd Philips' direction is haunting. The story, while familiar, is unique and fresh. Overall, this is the best Joker movie we could have ever hoped for. It's absolutely brilliant."
5092,"Believe the hype. What I have just witnessed is one of the most beautiful, harrowing and thought provoking films ever. Phoenix gives the performance of his life (he's come a long way since his vexed Gladiator days) and there's a relatable bit of Joker in is all, which adds to the tension. Imagine Michael Douglas' Falling Down but systematically throughout a lifetime.Cannot wait to watch it again... clowns will be everywhere again this Halloween"
5093,"In a nutshell keeping it plain and simple... This Movie was phenomenal. Please go watch it, and then decide from there. I had high expectations for this movie, and it managed to go beyond expectations. Can't wait to watch again."
5094,"The film is filled with awkward, intense, cringeworthy moments where you don't know whether to laugh or be horrified - and I loved every second of it. Director Todd Phillips take on the Joker was as good as it was due to Jauquin Phoenix's incredible take on such a storied character. To me, this movie was a much more modern and ""real"" take on how Aurther Fleck became the joker. Make no mistake, this is not a polished DC style movie with CGI and crazy effects. This is a gritty, dark drama that explores a man who feels alone, as if society has forgotten about him all together. His response is something the viewer can understand and even empathize with to some degree. The focus on mental health brings a move like this home and makes it feel far more down to earth than any other super hero movie. The different perspective on Thomas Wayne, Alfred, and other key characters in the Batman story provide an interesting counter point to the perfect benevolent super hero's were used to seeing.I can't seem to understand the negative reviews for this movie as this was easily one of the better movies I've seen this year."
5095,"Joker was the film I was most looking forward to this year! To be honest after the high point of Avengers Endgame, I was kind of feeling tired of all these superhero films. Even DC's Shazam (although a fun film) still felt very safe. However, DC had one more film up their sleeves that left me intrigued. No rhyme intended! JOKER! A film starring Joaquin Phoenix as the titular clown prince of crime. I'd always liked the character of the Joker, a phydistic clown who goes around causing mayhem.To me, there had been no definitive version of the Joker. I liked pretty much every interpretation of the Joker each had their own style. From Heath Ledgers mysterious crazed terrorist. Too Cesar Romero's clumsy clown. Heck, I even like Jared Leto's portrayal. That's why I was looking forward to see what Joaquin Phoenix could bring to the table.When the first trailer was released early this year, I was very pleased too see that this film was going for a dark gritty mature tone. It was a chance for DC to develop their most beloved villain with no restrictions. The Joker is insane and having us be able to see his violent crime would impact the general audience even more than any prior incarnation.The news that this was also going to be a standalone film with no connections to the DCEU excited me even more as the film could be itself without having to connect to a larger universe. At this point my hype was through the roof and it Id had to wait a few more months until I could see it.On October 5th I sat down to watch a film that promised to be an achievement in film. So after the film came to its conclusion I was left in me seat stunned. What a masterpiece!The film is an interesting intense depressing journey into the mind of the man who was going to become the Joker. It's about a man rejected by society and his revenge against. To me it felt refreshing to have comic book fill that felt nothing like a traditional comic book film. It felt like a psychological thriller. It felt refreshing. Not entirely new though. It took a lot of inspiration from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy and it is so obvious but this isn't necessarily a bad thing as it takes the best aspects of those films and greats a film which is shocking and thought provoking. The film is shot amazingly. Every shot has a purpose and it adds to the overall tone of the movie. Joaquin Phoenix is great as Joker and Arthur Fleck. You may be wondering why I refer to the Joker and Arthur Fleck as two different characters as to me these two sides of the same person are very different. And yesI'll say it again he deserves an Oscar for his performance. Robert De Niro is also an amazing addition to the cast he plays a late night talk show host called Murray Franklin and encompasses everything about a talk show host is about. He plays quite a significant role in Arthur's story and helps him become Joker. The supporting cast is also good but don't steal the show like Phoenix which is good because it's he movie.If your going into Joker thinking this is going to be your typical superhero action film your going to be very disappointed. Also, if you want to watch a film where the Joker commits crimes and antagonises the caped crusader this isn't the film for you. The Joker isn't even in the film to the very end of the film but boy is it good when he emerges. But I digress this film is about how the man becomes the Joker not about the Joker. Yes it's misleading to call the film joker but that's the point. However Joker is a marvellous piece of cinema and deserves to be given a chance. That's why I give it the highest rating of 10/10"
5096,"There are many things that are great about Joker, not the least of which is that it would be just as good if the character wasn't the Joker but anyone else. At the same time, the film takes well-thought liberties with the characters it borrows. The eternal portrayal of Thomas Wayne as a benevolent, almost saintly billionnaire seems completely out of date, while Joker's choice of making him an obnoxious, egomaniac, out of touch capitalist is much more realistic. Similarly, toying with the idea that Arthur is the brother of Bruce Wayne seems fitting - though this whole framework is a bit cliched, so it is best that the film leaves the issue open.For me, equally important is that even though the character is portrayed in sympathetic light, there remains no doubt he is a villain. So any concerns that the film could act as an apology for mass shooters, incels or whatever else are misguided - understanding how people are driven off the edge is not the same as glorifying them. Nor did I understand the news about viewers leaving the screening because of the violence - what violence? It's hardly a gore-fest, though its few violent scenes are maybe more realistic than usual.The only part where the film fell short was the whole idea that Arthur's actions inspired violent riots all across Gotham. The idea of riots erupting in support over the murder of three people (when the public cannot even know they were scumbags) is a bit ludicrous - as is the idea that the rioting masses will rise up to cheer and follow a guy who murders a tv host live on air. If things worked like that, capitalism would have fallen long ago - and unlike other comic films (as generic a term as this has become now) Joker is in every other aspect not just realistic, but plausible.Nonetheless, this takes very little away from the enjoyment of a truly excellent movie - as great as Joaquin Phoenix is in it, he is far from the only reason to watch it."
5097,Character driven. What a performance. Going to watch it again. A real must see.
5098,Joaquin Pheonix became the joker in this 100%. He put on an amazing performance. He portrayed the effects of mental illness and the effects society can have on someone. Brilliantly done. Wish he killed more people though. Hopefully theres another one. Joaquin in NOW the joker!
5099,"What would happen if someone took a beloved villain and rewrote their entire history? Surely, at first everyone would freak, because of the caricature of the character recent adaptions have offered. This is not the case here. Joker is what happens when they take a well worn character and they actually develope them, not just give them a modern day outlook but without the respective way of thinking. Basically it is like the writer thought how would the Joker be created today, without the toxic wastes. In my opinion, Joker is a brilliant combination of comic book accuracy and innovation, giving modern means and conditions to the villain we know (if after watching the movie we can still call him that), while also staying true to what makes the character tick."
5100,"All I have to say is watch this movie and do not expect it to be like the joker your originally know or any other superhero/villain move you have seen because this one is a masterpiece in its own realm that no other movie could touch. From start to finish this movie keeps you locked in. You always felt like something crazy was about to happen, and you wont be wrong, if you love thrills mixed with grim laughter this movies is for sure for you. If you cant stand blood or dark movies and expect it to be a lovey dovey Marvel esque movie then it might not be for you. I like a lot of Marvel movies even more than DC movies, but this one has to be up their with greatest of all time hero/villain movies ever."
5101,"What caught me in the film, is that it speaks about the violence that is the foundation of our modern capitalist economy.The violence in the wealth being hold by few and the way less wealthy are treated to be less worthy.There is violence in the methods of decit and deception being practiced on large part of humanity.That violence shields safely against the humor, comedy and other forms of mass amusement or mass opinion management.That violence lies in the method of humour of making fun, of entertaining the deprivation of masses.That kind of joke by the wealthy and powerful, is violence. But an act of violence by the ordinary, can come in disguise of a joke.I find this film a very dark comedy. The protagonist transforms from a harmless, out of work comedian to a serial killer, whose actions result into a mass disobedience in the city.It is a film of our times, dark times.*But I loved it that the film is a very bloody laugh on the violence and hypocrisy in our times.*The film is still sinking into me. Watched it yesterday night in a cinema hall. And the visuals and thoughts can't stop in my head.Powerful, brilliant, I guess this film is going to be one of the great films in the 21st century."
5102,"I have never thought to rate a movie. Personally, no movie comes to mind other than this title that is really worth raving about so ceaselessly as I've done since I saw it in theaters. I'll admit that I have no previous interest in superhero/villain movies, comics, etc, and I never really got into the whole Batman thing, BUT this film has me impressed. It's a different breed, and that's what I like about it. It explores the mind of a struggling man in a troubled life, and Joaquin Phoenix plays the part phenomenally. It's believable, it portrays interesting examples of what may happen with a mental illness, and the emotion I drew from it had me squirming in my seat. Many parts were uncomfortable, yes, but that may be because I'm a sensitive person, and the movie inducing this feeling isn't necessarily a bad thing. It seeks out emotion and sympathy.
I'm no great and knowledgeable movie critic, as I stated prior, but I did enjoy Joker enough to go as far as to make an IMDb account just to rate the movie. I enjoyed it that much. I do plan on purchasing a DVD of the film as soon as possible and giving it a re-watch."
5103,"The joker says more about society than we'd want to know. A terrible, monstrous masterpiece. A must watch."
5104,"I'll let other people focus on the incredible cinematography, nuanced acting, superb writing and detailed score. It's all amazing in my vastly unqualified opinion. What I'd like to offer my thoughts on is the underlying, cultural importance of this stunning, Kafkaesque caricature of life in an often solitary bubble that we somewhat ironically refer to as civilisation. It is the story of a man stripped to nothing but the subjective will to power without restriction, à la Nietzsche's 'Thus Spoke Zarathustra'. The introjected values that tether Arthur Fleck to society are diminished when they are not reflected in the behaviour of others that continuously overlook and mistreat him on account of his illness. He is relentlessly denied autonomy, agency, self-determination and subjectivity by a cold and abusive world until his climactic metamorphosis as this nightmarish, maniacal overman. I think the violence in the film speaks to a part of the viewer that we actively suppress because of our own introjected values and conditions. We leave the cinema and go about our day accepting that we've just witnessed an exciting, moving and deeply upsetting fiction. Yet in our dissonance between the aroused exhilaration and disgust, we are forced to acknowledge the very conditions that keep us in check within our role in society. It is a kind of thought experiment which ultimately highlights a very clear truth; society has a responsibility for it's own mental health, even more so to those that we have neglected and let down to the point that they break catastrophically. The upset and outrage inspired by the film is sort of the whole point. A film or videogame can't inspire violence in the meek, passive members of society who's sensibilities and expectations tell them that what they are seeing is horrific and unsettling. That's absurd. Equally, it can't inspire disturbing behaviour in those with the capacity to go out into the world and commit such acts. That darkness was already there, and it was foreshadowed by a lifetime of trauma and neglect. No, Joker doesn't beckon the bogeyman and instruct him to wreak havoc on the world. It simply holds a mirror up to society, showing us that the bogeyman is already here. We don't like what we see in our dire reflection because we were comfortable here in our faux, utopian soft play of ignorance and dismissiveness. It comes as no surprise that the establishment are already railing against this message, because they are the most comfortable of all. Let's not forget that we live in a world where pivotal books such Robert Cormier's The Chocolate War and Stephen Chbosky's The Perks of Being a Wallflower are still routinely removed from libraries. Yet, this bosom world in which we nestle is a fiction in itself. We value society because it offers protection, but what about the times when it fails? What about the neglected and the marginalised? Those that do commit radical acts of violence have ultimately been let down by the very social contract that promises to protect them, and it is on all of us to do something about it or accept our responsibility for the consequences. Joker is more than just a very important and timely admission of our shortcomings. It is a call to action; Not for revolution or civil unrest, but for compassion."
5105,Movie was so good i will be returning to the movies to watch it again this week. LOVEDDDDDD ITTTT. love! 12/10
5106,Joker(2019) is not the conservative take on clown price of crime's origin story. The story is not related to comic book but everyone after watching this movie will forget about everyone who has played joker before joaquin pheonix. The film is dark and depicts arthur fleck's daily struggle with society while simultaneously fighting with a rare medical which corners him from society. The film portrays how a failed stand-up comedian turns criminal and what circumstances made him to do so. Joaquin pheonix is legendary in the movie his performance is on another level. He has made himself eternal as the Joker. In future when we will talk about joker we will most probably think of joaquin phenix's portrayal than any other one out there. The movie is a masterpiece and will be remebered as a cult classic for sure.
5107,"Simply the best movie since interstellar! Visuali, soundtrack, acting everything"
5108,"Managing to stay true to the comics in an origin sorry based on the joker is tricky, due to the very nature of the character and the lack of knowledge of his former life which we have to go on. Without spoiling anything, much of this movie takes place in the viewers own mind. Leaving more questions by the end than you had going in, the movie manages to pull off showing us the Jokers history, while having us question if what we are seeing is in any way real, or if it depicts the character we think we all know. There are a few nods to the batman comics, but it isn't a batman movie in any way. Really, it isn't even a joker movie. It's a movie about a fractured mind in a fractured world, and it's self imposed confirmation, slowly becoming a character we both love and loath. Creepy, disturbing, intense. Phoenix really nails this version of the character, but also manages to capture the lonely, sad life of Arthur, leading us to fully understand, and both completely misunderstand the journey he takes during the course of the film."
5109,Its a simple movie about how an ordinary guy became a true mad monster that we know his name is joker completely master piece
5110,Unbelievable film. The acting. The cinematography. The score. If Joaquin doesn't win an Oscar I quit life. Go watch it now.
5111,"Joker.( The crown prince of crime)Joker is one of the finest movie of this era.
Joaquin's character development was extraordinary and was one of the greatest actings in movie history. Joaquin is the master and joker is a masterpiece.Let me tell you a joke.
""I used to think DC was a tragedy, but now i realize marvel is a comedy.""I dont have enough stars to rate this movie."
5112,"This movie show up how joker made up batman, Greatest villain Movie."
5113,"Who else could have played it better? What Joaquin portraited was sensational. What he showed on screen was nerve rattling, act was fantastic as good as it could be for any known best performance.
Though something was pulling the whole package down, for the movie to be top notch. Joaquin put on a tragic victim scene, a person rotting/broke down by system in Gotham city, but story didn't reflect much of it. Why did he had to kill 3 people? Can't get enough empathy for his actions. The whole story theme was in trailer.
Having said this, I still want to see it many times, see the Joaquin act again. Something is still captivating about the JOKER that makes it such a great movie to watch"
5114,"That is the best movie of 2019 , Joaquin Phoenix is really amazing he is THE joker , amazing acting, amazing directing, and amazing story.
DC made a good job in this movie.
Everyone must go watch it.
Good job DC 😄"
5115,"I will start off by saying I had very high hopes for this movie, but was not expecting it to live up to the hype. Neither was I expecting Joaquin Phoenix to even get close to measuring up to Heath Ledger's Dark Knight performance. I will admit I am a huge fanboy of Ledger, so when I say that Phoenix blew me away and gave an equally amazing performance in this film and that this movie is probably the best movie made during this decade, I absolutely mean that.This movie is more than just an origin story. It's an in depth view of how someone becomes a villain and the factors that lead to it. To start off, yes, Arthur Fleck, aka the Joker, is mentally unstable and suffers a condition that forces him to laugh in situations he shouldn't laugh in. Mix this with his anxiety, he is put in positions that are extremely uncomfortable that he doesn't want to be in. It also doesn't help that his social worker doesn't listen to him and is disgruntled by the fact that the government she works for doesn't value her profession enough to keep it alive. Arthur Fleck is a good person at heart in the beginning and is trying his absolute best to be happy and make people happy. But as the movie goes on, his attempts to do everything in his power are crushed, and ultimately, he hits a breaking point, leading the Joker to become a psychotic murderer.This above mentioned point is why I think critics and the media are quick to dismiss this movie, because it does not fit the ""guns and weapons"" are the problem narrative. If you look at any tragedy that happens, what get blamed? The weapon, or ideology in 99% of the cases. The media does this because it advances an agenda that they align themselves with. Heaven forbid the people committed the crime was actually just mentally ill and just looking for validation for their actions. Or better yet, will get recognition and fame from, you guessed it, the media.Now, where does the Joker fit in to the above mentioned point? Why I loved this movie so much is that the Joker sees validation for his actions. At first, the first murder is shocking, he's scared, and honestly the first murders could be justified as self defense. But as the media portray's the support he receives, he starts to think that what he is doing is ok, and ultimately there are some people that view him as a hero. Why, because the media allowed this happen and society validated it by supporting him.Aside from this point, the movie itself is phenomenally done. This is hands down the best origin story to have been made. It's brutally honest, it's dark, it's violent, and very uncomfortable at times. Phoenix's performance is the best I've ever seen him do. He deserves the Oscar, and quite honestly this movie deserves best picture. But it probably won't win it because it doesn't 1) Say everyone that is white is a racist or 2) Have a liberal agenda. or 3) Say guns are the reason for mass shootings, 4) Say's ""Orange man bad"".Critics are out of touch, and honestly are an invalid profession. Critic is another word for ""someone who gets paid to share an opinion."" At the time of this review, the movie has a 9.0/10 rating from ~150K users, with a metascore of 58 from less than 100. Listen to the masses instead of the ""Elite"" who claim to know better than you. This movie is worth the viewing."
5116,"Despite the title, I'm not going to compare Joaquin's Joker with Heath's here. This is a different film altogether. Heath brought us a beautifully crafted fully formed joker in DK, JP however brings us Arthur Fleck in all his disturbed severely mentally ill glory. It would be like comparing a caterpillar to it's butterfly..It's much less of a comic book movie than a horror film. In fact in parts of the film I forgot I was actually watching the formation of the joker, as Joaquin pulls us so deep into Arthur's illness, it becomes impossible to relate that character to anything remotely 'comic book'.Joaquin Phoenix is exceptional in this movie and he has to be, there is no supporting cast as such for him to hide a shoddy performance, just transient characters that either serve to further provoke or highlight Arthur's illness. Todd Phillips did a marvelous job here of making all of the characters bar Arthur somewhat disposable, they exist but only as a tool for Joaquin to use to craft Arthur. Even Di Nero is a passenger here, his character just used as a catalyst for Arthur's eventual brutal full metamorphosis into Joker. With that said though he plays his role beautifully and it was wonderful to see that man back where he belongs in a piece of cinematic history. The climax of the scene between them is just a thing of absolute movie genius, crafted out by two of our times greatest actors.I'm not sure how the movie got it's 15 rating here in the UK. The violence though not continuous is disturbing in it's realism, indeed the whole film felt 'adult'. It's definitely not a 15 that I'd be letting my 13 year old son watch anytime soon. I guess it's a box office thing!In all honesty though as much as I loved this film, I don't know if I could give it a second watch. Maybe that will change over time but right now I feel it's a movie like the usual suspects or seven.. I want to hold onto the surprise of this film, because I went in expecting something entirely different to what I was presented with.Joaquin's always been a slightly underrated actor for me. He's been nominated for three academy awards, most notably of which were best actor for Walk the line and best supporting actor for Gladiator, but has won none. His portrayal of Commodus especially was deserving of an Oscar. Tell me a movie villain you've ever hated more than that? I struggle to find one personally!! He MUST get an Oscar for this performance!!"
5117,"We lack so much of true, unrestricted art nowadays because of our seemingly growing attachement to ""morallity"" that questioning the status quo is seen like a threat to society,its like a new form of the old inquisition has grown legitimately beetween us so naturally, like it has back on the medieval age, that no one seems to notice. And the funny thing is that the movie seems to be so precise in its point of view that it has provoked a response in the actual system exactly as it would in the ficcional, from the movie. The people in control really want to control what we see and know in an almolst utopian level that is hard to believe. The morallity made critics and a part of the people who watched and were not ready for the thruth contained in the movie to dabate a possible censorship of the film, as it was even legal to do so with a piece of art.
Unfortunately, the opressive force of society really gets real nasty sometimes, and even now so many people ignore it. I, as a graduate from med school, can say from my little experience in a psychiatric ward that the plot, the movie, and the character doesn't seem as nearly insane as its beeing talked about when you know and understand what gets someone ""crazy"". Its real sad to see that society believes its evolving so fiercely, when its actually dehumanizing itself to a terrorrizing level just because we refuse to see the truth that surrounds us, and then call it morrally correct. Thats why the film bothers a few people so much, its not about the glorifiyng of violence or caos, its because it shows how the system breaks a man(even though it might seem exagerated to people who haven't seen it for real) and thats why it has to be seen."
5118,"The movie just made me feel to go back to the ticket desk and ask for another ticket for the following session. It was such a great journey to Joker's life. The acting of Joaquin, photography, colors, musics were just more than enough. It actually made me respect again for acting, directing and shooting a movie. The movie was an art. The emotions were so changing from scene to scene. Congratulations!"
5119,"I truly dislike Joaquin Phoenix as an actor, but his performance in this movie deserves an academy award. I went into this movie very skeptical of it, and I was blown away. It is a very dark movie as it should be when you are talking about The Jokers origins."
5120,"This movie was not what I was expecting, I was completely blown away and left feeling gutted. I loved every minute of it."
5121,First :The movie has no Connection to any comic book or whatsoever it's a standalone movie. It's very dark and grim in its potrayal of a sick man and his turn into insanity. It's almost too realistic because of the stellar Perfomance of Joaquin and the stunning music and cinematography. it's a beautiful movie of the most loved comic book villain of all time. A must watch.
5122,"What a great movie to trully enjoy Joker's toughts, and how to send a message to the people, this will have consequences"
5123,"What a movie it was! Dark, sensational, strong acting, thrilling and what not.. if you haven't watched it yet. Then pls goo nd watch it!"
5124,Great acting Great direction. We love you Phoenix.Great story by Mr Philips
5125,Movie is brilliant and should be a part of Hollywood's classics of all time.. it's exceptionally dark.
5126,"I used to think that my this movie was a tragedy, but now I realize, it's a comedy."
5127,"""Joker"" is a daring, unsettling and masterful character study that will leave you in awe.
.
In this psychological thriller, a mentally ill failed stand-up comedian named Arthur Fleck, turns to a life of crime in Gotham City.
.
The thing I absolutely loved about ""Joker"" is the slow burn. From the opening shot, Phoenix and Phillips are able to convey a knot in your stomach and that feeling doesn't go away until long after you've seen the movie. Joaquin Phoenix is the real deal. A complete game changer in method acting, he is hypnotizing. That is the perfect word to describe the performance; hypnotizing. A true Oscar contender and it will be hard to beat his performance because it is the best of the year. Will I compare Phoenix's performance to Heath Ledger's? No. That was the past and this is the now, and Phoenix's performance is what we need now. Aside from being a brilliant stand alone film, ""Joker"" pays hommages to so many great films of its genre from the 70s and 80s. The cinematography is outstanding and the score is simply haunting. I'll also mention that you will never listen to Frank Sinatra's ""That's Life"" the same again. Bottom line: yes, you should see this movie.
."
5128,"There are dozens of origin stories and then there's JOKER. This movie may be the new standard in that department for years to come.
I purposely avoided any and all trailers and previews for Joker so that I could go into it with an open mind. This movie was nothing I expected or imagined and that's a good thing.
I walked out of the theatre wondering what I had just witnessed and after some time I realized that the only way Joker's story could be told was in the most brutal and violent way possible. No other movies or performances have shown why he is Batman's greatest and most dangerous villain. He is an unpredictable, psychotic killer and this movie finally displays that characteristic in full color. It also shows his descent into madness.
I know everyone wants to know if Phoenix had a better performance than Ledger as the Joker. First off, they are two different approaches to the character. Ledger's is a straight forward full character from the get go with no back story or explanations. We already know who the Joker is and Ledger gives us what we want. Phoenix's Joker benefits from more screen time and a deeper story. He shows us all why Joker is who he is.
Both are great performances benefiting from the environment the actors were given for the character.
I was surprised and shocked at some of the turns that the movie took and it was as unpredictable and violent experience as a movie goer which mirrored the Joker as a character perfectly."
5129,"It's a must see. So much going on, not a fast paced movie, but wow so much going on. Phoenix is awesome, no surprise."
5130,"Few problems with the pacing, and some cliche 'checklist' type scenes in the movie, and the background storyline setup could have used more attention, but otherwise really good film and killer third act. Joaquin Phoenix is perfect in this movie (well, the role was written for him) and despite a bit of muddled messages from the movie, It's definitely not one that would incite incel violence or anything of the sort. The movie is ultimately more about mental illness and socioeconomic class."
5131,"As I am writing this, Joker has a 9,0 IMDB rating from around 150 000 userratings, and a 58 metascore rating. I honestly believe that this is due to critics not wanting to be seen recommending a ""terrorism-motivating"" movie, because the audience is clearly in the right here.I gave this a clear 10/10 because it simply deserves it. The score was breathtaking and the directing was amazing, especially considering he is someone with a background in mostly adult comedy movies. The cinematography was also very good. And then, the acting. I want to go as far as saying it is the best performance I have ever seen on the big screen (though, keep in mind, I don't go to the movietheatre THAT frequently).Go see this movie. It is probably tied with Endgame on movie of the year for me."
5132,"I guess many people have misunderstood this movie and I believe only those who have been exposed to such conditions will fully understand its message. It doesn't encourage to violence or justify it, but it shows how much bullying, abusing, and living within unjust societies, can be harmful and hurtful, and shows to where it can lead. I didn't care much about the violence or darkness rather than focusing on ""soul killing"" and being ""not afraid of losing anymore"" because of all the tragedies that joker passed through, the violence and the extreme incidents are just there to make the message more powerful and enlighten the minds of people who never passed through such conditions."
5133,"This is not just a 2 hour running movie but a feeling that you will enjoy every single second watching this. Joaquin does a really great job in this.
Worth every single penny time n pain......"
5134,"An incredible movie. Most of the scenes are so cruel, it's finger lickin good. Joaquin is the star of the movie. Amazing acting and the way he walks is just like the Joker that we all know. At the beginning I thought his laugh will irritate you, but it doesn't. The laugh gets each scene a more awfull feeling, you really feel his pain and you almost explain away his kills. I have to say nice k/d, he killed like 7/8 people and didn't die.A masterpiece."
5135,That was some good role playing i will watch it again.
5136,The Joker is not a role model. But he was human. he was Arthur. And Joaquin's performance just brilliant to show us that
5137,"Joker. The Joker is quite an extraordinary Film. I was stunned when I saw it in the cinema. The sheer depth of the movie was mind-blowing and in the good way. I can see why the Americans don't favourite is for me it is simply too deep for them, there so shallow they can see the depth in the movie.
Joker is more like a European film than a dis American it's a stand-alone film ma that shows depth and perfect character development. we can see Arthur going from going from hiding himself in a shell that he calls Arthur but he unleashes what has always been hidden under Arthur in the end of the movie The Joker. I would expect Joaquin to get an Oscar for his perfect repetition of the Joker."
5138,"It's rare for a film to stay with me into the next day, but this was such a powerfully disturbing, brilliantly acted story that I was thinking about it on and off for a long time. Joker is a deeply thoughtful, visceral reflection on the sad brokenness of a life cruelly twisted by the sins of others, that leads to hatred and violence. It is a dramatic tour-de-force from Joaquin Phoenix."
5139,"This movie was amazing, super dark and gritty. Made you sympathize with him for his mental illness while also watching how such can alter someone's mind to do crazy things."
5140,"I have to admit when i saw the trailers i was not hooked, but the movie blew me away.Joaquin Phoenix simply carries the entire movie by himself, even though sometimes it has weird and uncomfortable even disturbing scenes i was mesmerized through the entire time. The acting the screenplay, the cinematography is fantastic simply to say this is how an origin story should be told.Go and watch the movie and somebody give this man an Oscar!"
5141,"It's unfortunate that a large sum of people do not consider their own thoughts but instead of a few famous critics and the word of mouth. You'd be lying to yourself if you didn't think this movie was a 10/10. The acting, the soundtrack, the story; everything was perfect. The realistic aspects had everyone on edge. The emotional bond it created was superb. Consider watching it yourself with 0 bias and give credit to the deliverance of a perfect film."
5142,"I want to be completely honest in giving my review of this film. I am a huge fan of Joaquin Phoenix, but I was not very excited about this project. I believed the DC tales of Batman and the Joker were overly exhausted to the point they were no longer entertaining. I wholeheartedly thought I would hate this film.
With that said, I was completely shocked with the depth in story telling, phenomenal acting, and brilliant dialogue delivered by this film.
This is not a superhero/ villain story. This story goes much deeper into societal norms which are troubling and in many cases disturbing, but routinely go overlooked. This story dives into the psyche of a person who has experienced physical, emotional, and mental trauma at the hands of a society that really doesn't value him as a person and thus discards him completely as a sort of joke.
The politics associated with this film are very familiar and relevant to what we see and experience in today's political climate.
Some fear that those in power may see it as a threat towards the status quo, while those who feel oppressed may see it as a call to arms.
I completely understand why media is trying to discourage people from seeing this film; it is not because it doesn't deliver, but because it really does. This is a film that makes one pause, think and acknowledge that there are situations in this world that require us to be more human. It also opens our eyes to the class systems which still exist in our societies and how change is necessary to disrupt and eradicate those unfair and unjust systems.
I recommend everyone go see this film! 👍🏼👍🏼"
5143,Best dark Movie ever watched..... Hats-off to acting and directing 👍🏻😍
5144,A great movie that gives the inception feel!! You can't tell what is real and what's not!! A masterpiece that needs to be viewed multiple times!!
5145,"I went into this movie with VERY high expectations because of all the rave reviews and controversy and I as not disappointed at all. In fact it exceeded my expectations. I've never seen a more gritty, dark and twisted movie in my life.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is probably one of the best if not THE BEST acting performances I've ever seen. He is by far the best joker so far. From the Joker's laugh, mannerisms, down to the way her runs. Joaquin perfected it all. He definitely deserves every award this coming season. Heath Ledger would be proud.Just don't watch it expecting an action packed comic movie. It's all about the joker's origin and his slow decent into insanity. It's so unsettling and uneasy I can see why some people walked out. It's a very brutal and honest look at mental illness and how society treats people with it."
5146,"The Movie takes place in a 1980's Gotham City where it's depicted as a city with wealth disparity extreme violence and lack of empathy, the movie stars Joaquin Felix playing a deranged, mentally ill and suicidal character named Arthur Fleck, who lives in poverty with his mother, and working minimum wage jobs in comedy as a party clown, as the movie progresses, life becomes even more miserable as he gets mugged, beat up, humiliated, shown no care or empathy for his mental condition, and having his medical support shut down, and with each event he's growing restless and grows closer to snapping, which he eventually does, killing 3 rich wall street brokers after getting assaulted by them, which inspires a city wide outbreak where the joker is depicted as a hero for killing the rich, which is really this movie's weakest point, as the plot and motive for the poor hating the rich is very superficial, and only works in the case of Arthur, who has a genuine but mistaken hatred for Thomas Wayne (Yes, him) for not helping his mother financially after working for him for 20 or so years, who he decides to confront, first by visiting his home which inevitably fails, and then by sneaking through a crowd of demonstrators wearing Clown masks, into a theater featuring a high end screening of a Charlie Chaplin movie of all people, attended by the wealthiest people in Gotham, including Thomas Wayne, which Arthur successfully confronts in a bathroom, and tells him that his mother was mentally ill and delusional, and reveals that Arthur was adopted, not wanting to accept the reality he had just been dealt, he heads into Gotham's mental hospital and discovers it's all really true, he decides that it's time to fully snap into the Joker persona, he starts by killing his mother, and then, Live on TV, he Shoots Murray, The late night talk show host played by Robert De Niro, who he always watched as a kid, in what could be described as the most shocking scene of murder in a movie, because of it's subtle and abrupt nature, as he's taken into police custody after the event with seemingly no resistance, he escapes by the help of the people who he inspired to riot, he stands up, and draws a smile on his face using his own blood, ""yes, he is the Joker"", is what that scene would say, if a scene could speak, the final scene is classic joker, shown escaping from Arkham Asylum after killing his therapist, with that trade mark smile.A few side notes:the movie pays some respect to comic books, and only the people who read the original stories, would appreciate some scenes, but it's really very subtle as to not leave others clueless, some of those include:-Arkahm Mental Hospital Scene: where Arthur discovers the truth about his mother.-Bruce Wayne as a child, along with young Alfred, the Wayne Family's Butler, in the scene where Arthur tries and fails to confront Thomas.-The Famous Murder of Thomas & Martha Wayne: in a dark alley as young Bruce watches, a thug shoots his parents which happened as part of the riot, which was ok at best, but could've been utilized better, however the classic snap of Martha Wayne's pearl necklace, was quite the homage to comic books.-Arkham Asylum for the criminally insane: the culminating scene of the movie, Showing Joker escaping Arkham, foreshadowing an endless battle with Batman still to come.The Movie's sounds were also superb, the lack of sound effects or any instruments, in really intense, moments is very brave, because that means, that there can not be any motivation to feel a certain way, except by what you see, in addition, the sound track ""That's Life"" was a really good choice for the movie, a sick and twisted character such as the Joker, benefits from it, in the wrong way, which in this movie's case, is the right way.Verdict:Joaquin Felix's performance, is Superb, especially, in the beginning, where he is just playing a mentally ill character, which is really difficult to portray, and you can honestly sympathize with, to a character that is exactly the right kind of deranged for a joker character, and you can honestly not sympathize with, the performance is just brilliant, this is truly the most crazy, twisted Joker portrayed on a screen ever, Original, yet paying respect to comic book roots, simply what a Joker movie should be, do yourself a favor and go see it.9/10 ""Twisted & Brilliant"""
5147,"Joker review. NO SPOILERS. Simmering, haunting,brooding, painful, mesmerising,violent,shocking,powerful and yet beautiful.Just some of the adjectives that come to mind after last nights viewing. This is not an easy watch.It a slow burning character piece which gradually builds into a powerful demonstration of a man slowly breaking down. Joaquin Phoenix performance is extraordinary and completely convincing.He completely buries himself in the Arthur Fleck/Joker character and you feel a strange empathy with his sad isolated life.An Oscar nomination is nailed on.The cinematography is beautiful and it has deep dark score with a grinding cello that sticks in your head. For me it captures the frustration of the people and I couldn't help but compare certain aspects to certain political situations we experience today . Not for the faint hearted and it can be uncomfortable at times but it is totally successful in explaining Flecks tortured demise into insanity. Score 9/10Haunting and painful"
5148,"This movie was everything I expected and more the clever back and forth in to the mind of a clinically unstable man making you feel almost empathetic to his plight and fantastic supporting roles by beets and de Niro make this film a joy to watch
Don't expect a suicide squad type film from this, this is what dc should have been doing for years with the batman franchise the gritty darkness really brings Gotham to life and humanises thomas Wayne in a way all past films have failed to do so.
If Phoenix does not get an Oscar for this film it would be a travesty he was simply faultless in the whole film, he has you truly believing that he is mentally disturbed and also helps you understand why without being too blunt about it his performance was not just fantastic but also fantastically clever if this film doesn't bring light to the plight of the mentally ill in modern society then I truly don't know what will.This film will go down in history as a masterpiece that is not in any doubt as will Phoenix for his portrayal or Arthur fleck in this eye opening masterpiece"
5149,"As a die hard cynic regarding everything DC cinematic universe, this adaptation was an absolute breath of fresh air. There is no comparison to the flawless storyline, actors and cinematography of this film.A pleasant surprise that surpasses expectations and criticisms/ cyncisms as a comic fan. Phenomenal job"
5150,"The film presents the mysterious psychological journey of Joker. It represents how society, family and workmates could trigger the criminality of one's mind. Arthur Fleck is presented as a victim of the world's tragedy forming up what he called a comedy. We could only refer to his suffering as an audience through our own bad experiences and we could relate to him in a way or two. I guess what this film wants to convey is that we are one bad day away from madness."
5151,It's a classic movie and it will shake your bones from inside which is groosome
5152,"Along with the lies and the traumatic abuse he experienced through out his life, and the hate in the world that seems to hit him head on, Arthur began to take matters, good and bad, into his own life afte he learns a dark secret about his life.JOKERis a true fictional take of what mental illness sometimes is too some people. We, as a society, look at many people such as Nikolas Cruz and the many others that are guilty of the MASS SHOOTINGS, like they are just sick and crazy and throw them in the chamber. However, I am not condoning their actions, many people, young and older areignore certain times that show signs of endangering others. My belief, and after watching this movie, we need to start paying attention and act and prevent these such situations.
""An outstanding and phenomenal picture. Joaquin Phoenix is Brilliant. Todd Phillips's first film away from comedy, and he Delivers a KNOCK OUT."""
5153,"When I heard about a Joker movie I was a bit skeptical about it. Because usually knowing his origins isn't really a good thing. But I went into this movie with an open mind. And thankfully, I enjoyed it very much. One of the best things about it is definitely the acting. Joaquin Phoenix brings his A-game to this movie as well as everyone else. The music is amazing too. It fits perfectly with the time period. The story is also intriguing. It's not really new, but the way they did makes it feel fresh. The look is also amazing; I love the cinematography done here. And it can be pretty funny. I highly recommend this movie.9.3/10 (Amazing)"
5154,"Todd Phillips expertly depicted economic stagnation, social isolation, and cultural marginalization in a film which thoroughly reflects the times in which it was written. Although the film dragged for too long toward the end of the Joker's descent into villainy, its expert cinematography, Oscar-worthy acting, and contained plot line work harmoniously to evoke a visceral, poignant, and unescapable feeling of apathy. By the climax of the film I was uncomfortable, entirely impatient, and on the edge of my seat in frustrated anticipation of a euphoric and violent ending.This is an urban drama and phycological thriller well worth the ticket price; Not to mention, it's a DC franchise film.9/10."
5155,"This movie is an absolute masterpiece of cinema with an amazing score and filmography that shows the fall to insanity rather than telling you. I expect ""Joker"" to have a cult following for years to follow, a must-see movie on the list of many. It was an amazing, entertaining, and impressionable film that the audience will take home to ponder and discuss. The film depicts talent in story-telling and performance. I genuinely didn't want the movie to end; Joaquin Phoenix is so mesmerizing to watch on screen (playing the joker to the highest standard I've seen thus far) that I would be disappointed if the academy looks over his performance. I'm calling for an Oscar! And a sequel! The ""Joker"" is the best movie I've seen this year, and it'll be the best movie you've seen this year too. Get a ticket and descend into madness! Dance your way home afterwards just as I did!"
5156,"The movie is very dark and disturbing!
It shows character transformation of a normal man with a mental illness who is just trying earn a living and take care of his mother. But the society is such that it lacks compassion for such individuals and calls him a freak, bullies him and corners him to such an extent that he becomes a true agent of chaos."
5157,"Considering DC's track record when it comes to film, I wasn't all that hopeful for the quality of this movie. However, after actually seeing this movie I can safely say that I enjoyed it very much.Joker builds an air of tension from the very beginning with a slow but deliberate first act with everything from there on only getting more and more intense. The way Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck is amazing and should be highly commended as one of the great performances this year. The way he plays the joker as a delusional, sadistic killer and failure of a comedian is excellent, creating amazing moments of horror, cringe and disgust that draw the audience into the film and engulf us in the story of this mans downfall into insanity.I would highly recommend this to any fans of the character and anyone looking for a break from the typical action blockbusters that we have come to know this genre of superhero movies for."
5158,"Whoever think this movie deserves a 100k/10 , go to the review and sort by who ever a hater or an idiot who gaved this movie a 1/10 give a not helpful tag and report him by inappropriate...."
5159,"Great movie, phoenix does it well. Not too dark like they are saying. Everyone is different but it's not IMO. Good take on mental health. Top movie."
5160,"There is no word can explain my feelings about this movie, phonics did more than what is expected from his character."
5161,"One of the greatest movies ever made, everything was spot on, incredible performance by Joaquin Phoenix , just wow."
5162,"Once again, this is not a family movie. If you have an urge to see glowing dudes/gals jump to each other, you may not like this one.It is a great movie. A great movie gives people a strong feeling which is not necessary a good feeling. a great movie makes people think. Joker achieves both. The story, the rhythm, the acting, the cinematography, the music.. all are great.Would it get any Oscar? No. A struggling white male straight human being? Are you joking? Definitely not an Oscar type movie.Does it steal from Martin Scorsese? I don't know. The King of Comedy only kept me up for 5 minutes.Very sad to hear 4 homeless people were killed in NYC on Oct 5. News outlets didn't cover it very much maybe because the audience doesn't care too much. Somehow, this is related to the issue the movie try to represent..."
5163,The movie is just perfect but it is not a joker or dc movie.There are some easter eggs like waynes or gotham but the story isn't about the joker we know.It's about a mentally an ill guy who is going crazy.
5164,"""Knock knock...""Joker is about Arthur Fleck, he's a disturbed and formerly hospitalized clown in Gotham City who lives with his sick mother he takes care of. He also has aspirations of being a stand up comic and is a big fan of the Murray Franklin Show, Gotham's big TV late night talk show and after a video of Arthur's bizarre stand up act gets shown on the show... he's invited to be appear on the show for an interview.So I JUST saw this movie....And... it's all still flushing around in my head so I'm having a hard time writing a proper review for it. I keep starting to write and then I start over and so on... so I wouldn't call this a review, more ""first impressions"".Because there's a lot to get into with this movie and there's things to discuss.I got home from Avengers: Endgame and knew exactly what I thought about it.Joker... I don't know, I need some time and maybe even to see it again. Maybe in IMAX which I can't BELIEVE Warner Bros put the time and effort into making an IMAX version of THIS movie...But... I liked it... might have even loved it.... but it's not perfect. It's not the R-rated Joker movie of my dreams.... which would kinda just be The Dark Knight but with blood. Like I already GOT my perfect Batman AND Joker movie in 2008 so anything after that is a nice bonus.There's nothing in it I disliked but... it never hit heights I would have hit if I was given the keys to the Gotham City kingdom. For one thing, it's a shockingly small movie, hence my slack-jawed reaction to finding out that right now people are watching this in IMAX.It's a psychological thriller, it's not a horror movie or a crime drama. It's a drama about an insane person.The movie it reminded me of the most wasn't even the Scorsese movies Todd Phillips says he was inspired by but One Hour Photo. This is a 2 hour movie where the only guy we're with is a complete psychopath.There's no hero in this movie. There's no relief, there's nobody trying to stop the Joker. So the worse he gets, the more tense the movie gets because we know there's no Batman or Commissioner Gordon coming to the rescue here. So this makes for a pretty unpleasant movie.Joaquin Phoenix gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Joker and he might even win for this movie. Is he better than Heath Ledger? No.... but it's SUCH a different version of the character it's not even comparable.... which brings me to maybe my main complaint with this movie....I think.... this movie would be a LOT better.... if it were not called Joker. I think knowing it's The Joker I had so many expectations of where this movie would take this character and that kinda hurt my first viewing.Maybe on a rewatch that'll go away completely but I kept thinking this movie would play better if you didn't know you were watching a movie about the Batman villain The Joker until the final act. Because I certainly kept expecting a lot more... Joker-y type stuff in this movie and it really doesn't tap into the Joker I'm familiar with.This isn't a criminal mastermind mixed with a serial killer with a permanent smile, it's not Nicholson's Joker or Ledger's Joker.... it's a whole new thing.It really is more of a Joker origin story than a Joker movie. Like this entire movie almost feels like the first act of a proper Joker solo movie. I REALLY hope they make a sequel because as much as I enjoyed elements of it I wanted way more.Lack of Batman is not the issue here at all, by the way. Joaquin Phoenix does more than enough to carry the movie on his own but.... at the end of the day I wanted more of a horror movie, more of a crime movie.What we GOT was very good..... but I can't help but think it could have been better.This is not a proper concise review, I might be able to have one in the near future. Because like I said there's loads to get into.But I'll say I liked what I saw... but I need more time to process it.I'm definitely VERY curious to hear what others think of Joker."
5165,"I was in theatre and ""send in the clown"" was playing at the end credits, glued to my seat and thinking... What I ve just experienced in past 100 minutes or so has brought some deep dark somberness in me. This dystopian city, its brunet tones, The character, the story, the psyche, the fall the rise and the glorification of a human condition was so spine chilling yet satisfied to my grizzly brain which I put forward to watch this kinda cinema.
Joker was not just a movie for me since I saw its trailor . Never seen such mastery in a trailor in the recent years. I had this anticipation that a movie can't carry much more than what's shown in the trailor but the end scenes proved me wrong conveniently.
Phoenix is a great actor or not, should be left for critics and Oscar Jury to decide. For a movie buff like me he pierced a hole in my heart with his brilliant performance. The art and craft of acting at its best. I was wondering he might be suffering from some kinda ""post-partum"" depression after delivering such performance. I was imagining him studying the character, discussing crying and laughing scenes with the makers and seeing his psychiatrist after that. I liked him in ""The Gladiator"" as a face meant to depict inner turmoil but here he locked his genes for showing what need to be shown and nothing else... So folks! A well presented intelligent and a cult of its own movie is here. Go see it without popcorn and slush as it might give you a guilt later that while crushing popcorn you might have missed some spine chilling moments and keynotes from the amazing sountrack."
5166,After batman tRilogy a satyric comedy follow.is typically American film influenced from tarantino.perfect in all fields except from songs of osd alittle bit pas'e although good basic theme.unforgetable movie favourite for oscar nominations also good critics of all severe Medi a .from now on will remember that film every time I lough.A unique masterpiece
5167,"First review for me,but i had to do it for the non-thinkers.
no spoilers here,even if you watch several trailers,like i did,it is packed with action! -no,not the headless running around cgi-kind that fills our minds with nonexistent bullcrap theese days. i.am a long time fan of comics(never looked at joker like this) and hate the disaster movies lately. heroes in comics did not kill half of the population while bringing the bad guy down. that anyone goes on with their lifes,smiling at the hero saving the day but missing 3/4 of their families.i mean,i get it now,while i.am writing,why people don.t like it. because they maybe expected that joker starts jumping around 20 feet up in the air,ripping of buildings and eating humans,or at least cars.to smash half of the city and being chased down by cgi-bats. and it.s because this is a true movie,about a true character. it is so real,you can almost touch the world he is living in-because it is actually our world. a bit of fresh air for as long as i can.t remember. just when i thought,there will be no true movies any more. THIS ONE,my friends,will make you think about society and yourself.then again,people don.t think any more. they just want to be lied to and fed with cgi-popcorn and vr-juice. but in the end,it.s ok...it.s not a movie for everyoneif you look at it and admit it.s a perfect picture of us and what this world is we are living in,it.s a win. if you want impossible jumps and disaster packed ""hero""-film,go see everything else.oh,and one more thing in regard of vigilante. i love the fact that joker is(or,at least starts of with)cleaning people that are just garbage of society (the ""superrats""),and that before any other self proclaimed rich justice leader. for me,he is the first vigilante of all. used to look up to batman in my childhood and later too, but this ladies and gents ""is what you get..."",and it.s a mature film for those who lived enpugh to experience the society we live in.tonight was the second time I saw it and it's getting better.edit:watched it 5x...and the acting is outstanding. it.s my fav.movie now...because of J.P. what he did here,if you are a movie fan,you can not oversee it. it.s magnificent,tons of moments of real emotions. this is cinema at it.s best"
5168,Great movie!! Joaquin was excellent in his performance and the story was really good. I usually do not like movies that includes only one good character but this one is a must to see.
5169,"This film is an interesting one. It's almost too much to take in the first time you watch it. The film is very much in the same vain as Taxi Driver and King of Comedy as to be expected, these inspirations were never a secret to begin with but it also somewhat reminds me of the more recent Nightcrawler, another incredible crime noir about a psychopath. That being said I think Joker takes on a much more dreamlike tone, every scene feels grounded and realistic at the same time as being avant-garde. It's quite impressive honestly. Let's get into some spoilers shall we? First let's discuss my least favourite thing about the film which isn't even much of a complaint and that's the plot twist surrounding Zazie Beetz' character Sophie... I personally found the twist very predictable but at the same time the people I went to see it with didn't see it coming at all so I can't say definitively it was a predictable twist, on the other hand I actually still think it works, predictable or not. Arthur is an incredibly lonely man and the idea that he would meet this beautiful woman he wanted to be with and delude himself into thinking she wanted the same is a believable one. Next I'd like to talk about the violence. This film has less than most films of the comic genre but when it happens it makes up for that with its brutality. The violence here is truly disturbing and more graphic than I was expecting, one scene in particular involving a pair of scissors had me practically shielding my eyes, it's gnarly stuff. If you know the joker as a character and have read The Killing Joke and The Dark Knight Returns this film wont have too many surprises as it takes quite a lot of inspiration from those two stories in particular, but it does put its own spin on them and adds enough of its own intriguing questions to keep you interested even as a die hard fan. Now, let's talk about the clown himself, Joaquin Phoenix. This man is a force of nature. His performance here is truly unforgettable and as many have been saying Oscar worthy. It's hard to explain what makes his performance so good but watch it and you'll know what I mean. Another thing I adore about this film it's ambiguity to a lot of the events in it. Although somewhat explained, Arthur's true parentage is still left somewhat in the air, allowing you to make your own mind up on who and what to believe. The same goes for the ending of the film which is executed in such a way that you don't know wether the previous events of the film were all some sick fantasy or wether they really happened and this was the outcome, this idea that anyone can believe what they want and anyone can be right (or wrong) is a refreshing one that we don't get too often in cinema. Lastly I want to talk about the cinematography and soundtrack. The cinematography is fantastic. From the bright, colour faded streets of Gotham in the day to the dark, dank subways they've really made Gotham feel like a real place and captured its essence from the comics at the same time. Shots are usually uncomfortably close or filled with negative space and this really helps pull you in to Arthur's world. The soundtrack is one of my favourite things about this whole film. Its Subtle, grinding basses and violins are beautifully haunting and help make this film what it is in my opinion. The bathroom and final scene are standouts. Overall I believe this film is a masterpiece. It's not for everyone but if you are like me and love, gritty, noir crime thrillers this should be on your watchlist. I'm gonna give Joker a 9.5/10. Max... Out."
5170,"A cinematic event to be remembered - with themes of mental illness, bullying, the subjective nature of comedy, mob mentality/political outrage, trauma, murder, rich vs poor and an Oscar-worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix, JOKER makes for a disturbing, stressful, uncomfortable 2 hours that will leave you thinking about the blurred lines between good people and bad people, and the people who pretend to be good and the good people that become bad.Out of this world sound design and cinematography make this a must-watch if you can handle it. Earns its hard R too.9/10"
5171,"I'm a huge DC fan. I knew from the first trailer this was going to be a good movie. Joaquin Phoenix surpasses all my expectations. His performance deserves an Oscar. Also, the music was so haunting and beautiful. It definitely helped set the tone. Couldn't have been better. This movie makes you think about the affects society can have on a person. Can't wait to see it again."
5172,"Joaquin Phoenix's performance in this movie was stunning as he plays a mentally challenged man who lives in an even crazier world. The movie explains how Arthur evolves into The Joker we know from Batman. However, this Joker is vulnerable and a victim of traumatic circumstances. I am moved by how well Joaquin brings this comic character to life and creates an image of a believable human being who doesn't want to be a victim anymore. There are several thought provoking elements in this movie - like, this is what happens when you place a gun into the hands of a mentally and emotionally lost and drainef person. Can't wait to see this movie again - I personally find Joaquins acting exceptional and mesmorizing - and Oscar worthy!"
5173,"This movie was freakin fantastic! The cinematography, the writing, the acting, the soundtrack is phenomenal. Hands down for the director Todd Philips for writing such a masterpiece, and most importantly to Joaquin Phoenix for killing is as The Joker!PS Don't believe what the critics say. It's their job to find a problem to every solution. They get paid to spread hate and negativity about movies."
5174,Joker is a film that is disturbing and uncomfortable in all the right ways. It manages to pull off an original and unique spin in the superhero genre. The only complaint in the film that I can think of is that it is just a bit too simaler to taxi driver and king of comedy. Don't believe the contravercy trying to make you afraid to see this movie. If movies were restricted from telling a story questioning ourselves and our actions than we have ruined the art of Cinema as we know it.
5175,"Watching this movie seems like sitting with dementors for 2 hours (in a good way, obviously). They spread the darkness and eat your soul."
5176,"It has been such a long time for a movie to receive such divisive reviews. However, one thing for sure is that Joaquin Phoenix delivered the performance of a lifetime. For example, when he transformed into Joker, his whole body changed, and that newfound sense of confidence could be felt. It isnt a typical comic book movie, but I believe that this new approach DC is taking has a lot o potential."
5177,"Excellent piece of art, one character carries the all movie, thast way it's impressive, ledger did it but along side Batman figure, Phoenix was a oneman show"
5178,"One of the best movies I've seen in years! Well written character development and excellent acting by Phoenix makes this movie a must see. If you want to explore the madness that makes this clown laugh, then you must experience the sadness and despair that he battles. If you think Batman is his archenemy, you would be wrong."
5179,"A incredible construction od character with and tremenduous conclusion, opening the door for a whole new and darker Batman universe in movies. This movies demands a Best Picture Oscar and a Best Actor for the amazing Joaquin Phoenix performance. A masterpiece that will be remembered not just another super-heroe movie (like Avengers), but a dark and heavy must-watch movie. That's the Joker everyone wanted to see!! Hope they don't mess up on Robert Pattison's Batman, cause if they don't, this new Batman chronology will be the best one for sure!"
5180,Mesmerizing! Joaquin Phoenix is a genius. I am still shaking.
5181,"Good lord, I was spellbound by acting, background score, camera work and story line and character development. Not one moment of boredom. The best movie I watched in a decade."
5182,"It's a great movie, yet very disturbing. In fact, the kind of mentality and psychological condition showed by the main character, the same that was later disseminated in much of the population, is the revolutionary type of mind. The same that is always presented in the crowd that commits major crimes and destruction in all revolutions: the French revolution, the communist revolution, the nazi revolution.It is a very dangerous situation when chaos and anarchy emerges after so many people believe that reality is always about oppression between groups, and they are the victims, and there is no right or wrong, good or evil, except fight for the revolution that will bring, somehow, some day, a better and fair future.But there is no such a thing. Destruction, murders and hate will never bring heaven to Earth. There will always be problems, poverty, injustice and suffering. We can do nothing about that, except try to be better human beings,do good instead of evil, save lives instead of kill, forgive what can be forgived, construct instead of destruction, and try to live a good, altruistic and honest life."
5183,"Joaquin Is good as usual. I thought this movie Had good writing, acting and was visually interesting. On another day I might give this 9 stars. I just felt more sorry then captivated by the Joker. I guess that's the point , but I wasn't really that entertained. I'm hoping we see Joaquin In a sequel."
5184,Juaqin Pheonix is amazing in this film! He deserves best actor at the academy awards hands down!!! I'm ready for the next DC movie!! Mostly I just want this to have a sequel.He doesn't play joker the same as Heath Ledger. I love Ledgers version more. Phoenix plays it very differently but was very very very good!!!
5185,"This rendition of the Joker is absolutely nuts! That is simply the only rational way to describe. I went into the movie with very high expectations, and may I say those expectations have been exceeded. The way Phoenix portrays him is so incredible, and the scariest part is that he managed to humanize this psychopath and almost make you pity him. I left the movie theater in a state of shock, not completely comprehending the beauty I just saw.
Another thing which was done so beautifully in this movie was the way that it strayed away from the DCU and comic book movies as a whole. If this film could be closely related to any film prior it would be ""Taxi Driver"" by Martin Scorsese. All in all, it was incredible movie that is more than likely to make some serious noise at the upcoming oscars!"
5186,There have been many movies I have watched over the years. I have seen them all. I must say that movies that are written well are those that make you get lost in the story. Ones that make you feel like you are roght there with the character. That is real movie artistry. Thats what I found in Joker. Well done people well done.
5187,"This is definitely the best movie out of DC extended universe. You'll feel the struggle arthur went through from the first part of the movie, you will feel sorry for him. and the cinematography is really good too, the tone, the vibe, everything how you'd imagine gotham would be like is there. character arc is amazing as well, from the point that he's just a regular dude trying to make money up to the point that he just lost it. Joaquin and de Niro performance is mindblowing. the way he talks and move is just spot on. However if you have a weak stomach then you probably have to be ready to cover your eyes, because you know... it kind of like Deadpool, the gore stuff, only wrapped in completely different package."
5188,"I really liked this movie and if the times were different it would probably win an Oscar or two. Joaquin Phoenix is truly outstanding in this film and the scenography is perfect just like the soundtrack.
The intense music just added to the dread I felt while being insecure of how Arthur would react to stuff.
This is a movie worth seeing, maybe more than once.
Is this the best movie of 2019? I think we have a winner here yes."
5189,"This movie is a heartbreaking testimony of the failure of various levels of our society. It speaks to cruelty, altruism, the misunderstood, the over-medicated, child abuse, judgement, bullying, mob mentality, mental illness, loneliness, trauma, neglect, ineffectiveness of our mental health care system, cognitive dissonance and poverty. There's more but just watch this, learn from this and cherish it. It's a pure tragic masterpiece."
5190,"For everyone worked in this movie .. THANK YOU for this 2 hours and 5 minutes. After so many movies, a Joker came so that I can finally loved the year 2019 .. this movie was a masterpiece in every way, the character development was perfectly plotted and of course performed, the music and the general theme of the movie lets you feel the deep sadness in every laughter .. I felt this movie .. I lived in it .. I loved it so much .. I don't give a thought about comics or super hero movies .. but this Joker .. this was something else .. this was a true GREAT movie .."
5191,"Joker one of the greatest, psychotic and the most memorable villains of the comic book world has managed to have his own movie and this time Joaquin Phoenix who will be playing the ""Clown Prince of Crime"" (and not Jared Leto).The plot tells the origin of a man named Arthur Fleck who feels disregard by everyone around him, he works as a clown who's waving a sign for store sells and entertaining kids at a children's hospital and he has a passion to become a comedian. The downside is that he lives with his sick mother in an old ratty apartment and he's been beaten up on the streets and because of this, his world slowly crumbs and starts to turn himself towards violent.When I first heard about this movie being made, I wasn't expecting myself to become all hyped up with joy, simply because I've seen other comic book films that has the antagonist starting in the main role (such as Catwoman, Suicide Squad, and Venom) and if you seen them, than you would know that the antagonist starts as bad at first, then becomes a hero at the end. But when early reviews came in before the film came out, I decided to take my interest on it and to my surprise, I was very pleased.Joaquin Phoenix gives an amazing performance for a character who is going downhill with his life, it makes me feel the sorrow of him because of how bad his life is treating him and that can be a dangerous thing too because with whatever emotion one person has in life and if that emotion isn't good, then that same person could go crazy because of it. So in a nutshell, not only did I feel sorry for him, but I was also feeling scared of him too. Another new thing about this Joker from previous ones is that he also has PBA (Pseudobulbar affect) which I felt that it was a great idea and interesting thing to see in this movie. The cinematography is also well done too as the movie feels more like a drama than a comic book.Overall: Some people will either choose to have Joker with or without an origin, me personally I don't mind having both. While I can still buy the whole falling into a pool of Ace Chemical story, I can also still have an origin of how the Joker became crazy and this movie did an amazing job of it. And yes while Alan Moore was the first to tell the Joker's origin in ""The Killing Joke"", but I felt like the director and the writer was inspired by the novel and manage to create an origin their own while keeping the idea from the novel as well and because of it, Joker is the movie I recommend to anyone who is interested in seeing it."
5192,This is one of the Best movie i have watched so far most watch recommendation.
5193,"The best film of 2019. Joaquin Phoenix did something so surreal but in a good way. This is Tod Phillips best directing work, from the soundtrack/score, cinematography, script and acting, I consider this movie a classic cinema gem! Not your feel good movie, don't take your kids and don't expect a typical comic book movies. It's dark, disturbing and brilliant. Heath ledger was amazing but Joaquin was just as equal or better at times, both are my favorite joker in film.. wow what a movie!"
5194,"This movie.... Pure perfection, amazing character development!"
5195,Stunning and absolutely mesmerising performance by Joaquin. His acting skills are beyond par complemented by the amazing cinematography and direction by Todd Phillips which adds motive and meaning to the film
5196,Joaquin completely disappears in to his role of the Joker. His performance is amazing! If he does not win an Academy Award for his performance I will be shocked. The movie was great. Terrifying and sad at the same time.
5197,"I thoroughly enjoyed everything about this movie. I've heard complaints about pacing or the first hour ""dragging on"", but those claims are likely by those expecting an action movie. The film did an amazing job showing Phoenix's descent into madness every step of the way, almost causing you to root for and empathize with the Joker. Joaquin brought new elements to the clown prince of crime, and this movie will sit atop my list for as long as I can see."
5198,Watch this movie with a open mind. Simply a amazing movie.
5199,"""I am without speech"", as Elaine in Seinfeld said. I was close to tears and the hair in the neck was standing straight up throughout the movie. This is a genius work. One of the most important movies ever. I think a person has to be empty and soulless to not feel and see what a masterpiece this is. Just watch it. It is beyond words, really. This is the movie this rotten evil society and system needs right now. Thank you Joaquin Phoenix for this pure genius portrayal of how it feels to be truly depressed and lonely."
5200,"Watch Joaquin run in an effort to maintain his place in society, watch Joaquin run from those who are trying to restrict him from being a part of a functional society, and everything in between. The arc is steady and peaks when its supposed to.The story is well-paced and it's hard to say any scene lacked meaning or intent. The cinematography is great, with exceptional sound design to accompany it. The acting is solid throughout and you may become convinced that Joaquin just isn't okay.The message of this film can be interpreted in many ways. One make an argument that 2019 is an awful time for this film to come out. But one can also say that the message is important to hear and consider. It's not political but societal, and no matter what your interpretation is, it revolves around the idea that we need to take care of each other as humans.Ultimately, this is a great story that's presented just as well. It's not necessarily gripping, and you probably won't get too emotionally invested. It's not going to tug at your heart strings either. You will, however, become empathetic to Arthur Fleck and his world, as he sees it, as he experiences it. And while you may not agree with his methods, you will agree that, in his world, something had to be done."
5201,"I believed all of the hype and went to this movie with extremely high expectations. This movie exceeded them in every aspect possible. All I can hope for now is to see Joaquin in another film as the Joker. This movie was so dark and disturbing which I felt was the best part. Unreal character development, unbelievable soundtrack and eerily relevant to modern day problems. I fee the critics were afraid to give this movie better reviews just in case there is some public backlash. Very risky film in today's climate. Enjoy everyone!"
5202,"Joaquin Phoenix stars as Arthur Fleck, a disturbed loner who has absolutely no luck in life from the fact that he is an actual clown by trade and the very first scene in the film he is seen getting beatdown & robbed from street gang, to the fact that he also lives with his delusional mother. From that point on you know your gonna be in for a rough ride
For those expecting a action film or an exciting movie you will be sorely disappointed. This is a brooding slow burn character piece that boils up to a mesmerising climax. The cameo's and easter eggs in this film will please true fans from the graphic novels.
The movie takes and its inspiration from Martin Scorsese's King Of Comedy & Taxi Driver (both with De Niro) to its style, plot & tone.
Joaquin Phoenix is truley astonishing in every way possible and deserves an Oscar nomination. Robert De Niro also stands out in a minimal role as the host of Gotham's late night TV show.
This will not be for everyone as it is extremely bleak and grim throughout, with some shocking scenes of violence.
As an original take on the Joker's origins and the state of gotham, it is very well made and one of the best films of the year."
5203,"This Taxi Driver-esque film is a fun entertaining roller coaster ride with Joaquin Phoenix taking the mantle as one of the best portrayals of one of Gotham's most terrorizing criminals. This film delivered an amazing color palette and serves as a great slow-burner psychological thriller that brought thrills and chills to the audience in all the right ways. This will be one of the most famous films in America and will be just as popular as A Clockwork Orange was back in the 70's. Quite morally wrong yet so intriguing, this is one of the most interesting of films seeing how the film puts us in the shoes of Arthur Fleck, a mentally ill person on the brink of madness. With it's deliver of an amazing cast, soundtrack, and cinematography, this is one of those rare films that feel like the 70's. If only it had lasted an extra half hour or so because I honestly wanted more. Shorter cuts on long length scenes may sound like i'm pulling the horror away from the movie but I feel it'd be best if they cut some scenes a little shorter than others just to move the story along. Even though it's quite shocking, I still believe this movie can't surpass films such as Requiem For A Dream or The Dark Knight, it's still one of the best character studies out there but I think it deserved a 94 percent with Dark Knight at 97, and Requiem with 98. Very up there in my personal favorite films so don't be disappointed if you had just read my whole review."
5204,"For those who have been searching the 90s movies for quality stuff...JOKER is an absolute treat for you for us.
It so hauntingly and beautifully dangles the idea infront of us that how emotionally unstable a normal looking person can be, how the fear and agony of forlorness overpowers the human mind and how ignorant are we of those whom we claim to know...
It makes you wonder that somewhere at a particular moment while walking past some taxi stand, waiting in queue, parking your car or having a promenade you too have stood beside, walked and drive past a Joker....
Every once in a while you watch a movie that blows you away, leaves you in awe and stays with you forever...let JOKER be that movie."
5205,"The movies acting is off the charts, but it does start off slow. The whole movie builds up for an amazing ending. The last 15-20 mind are worth going to the theaters to watch this gem of a movie."
5206,"From acting to directing, everything in this movie was just perfection. I adore this movie"
5207,"I was so looking forward to seeing this film and oh boy was I NOT disappointed, everything about it is first class from the storyline the main characters development and the music score is brilliant. As soon as it was over I wanted to see it again. yes Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar he is a fantastic character actor, this film has made me want to go and watch all of his films. I personally didn't have an issue with the violence, I found this film to be poignant but not disturbing. Loved every minute of it."
5208,"I usually hate origin stories for bad guys. I don't need to know why they ended up that way. Prometheus in my opinion ruined the Aliens but Joker is something else. Jacquin Phoenix gives one of the best performances I've ever seen. Some scenes are just uncomfortable to watch and that's all down to him. Now don't get me wrong, it's not like the way 'requiem for a dream' is uncomfortable to watch it's the fact that it's played straight makes him so unsettling. As in this is not the Jack Nicholson or Jared Leto over the top super villians versions...this is a man suffering from severe mental illness turning psychotic and it's grounded in reality. This version could happen. That's the unsettling thing. Enjoyed trying to keep an eye out for any DC comics history references. Shame on all the people complaining and trying to censor this movie by saying its dangerous and glorifying the villians. It does no such thing........and by the way.......... it's just a movie."
5209,"The Joker is not a role model. He never was, never will be. His actions aren't justified, and neither were they right. But before the make-up and purple suit came on, before the blood-smirked smile formed shape, and before he got crowned as the Clown Prince of Crime, maybe the Joker was human. Maybe he was Arthur. And Joaquin Phoenix as joker and this movie makes us feel for him."
5210,"After seeing the trailer my hopes were sky high and, because of that, I was a bit worried how it would turn out. But, now that I've seen it, I can gladly say it did NOT disappoint. To be quite frank, it actually surprised me how raw and unsettling the movie is, even though I was expecting something around these lines. Joaquim is amazing the entire time, he's sad and depressed and you can watch the Joker growing inside him as the movie progresses. A few tímes it feels over the top, like too many coicidences happening at once, but when compared with the greatness of everything else it just seems like nitpicking.
After the backlash this movie went through with the media and stuff, I'm thankfull it wasn't a disaster. 'Joker' is just as the movie itself, a survivor in a clown world. Go see for yourself, it's a dark take on a great villain, and it doesn't let you down."
5211,"I love the joker from all the comics to the tv shows and movies. I went to see this film and made sure I went without comparing it to heath ledgers joker. Many have said they walked out of the theatre, due to its violence and how it may affect people of the country it is viewed in, that it may spur on violence. I am sorry but this movie is tame in comparison to others! It is a story of a fictional character!!! it is a masterpiece, it is sad depressing honest brutal untamed and bitter at times! But this is what the joker is!! It is his story. The acting is sublime. The darkness of the movie the scene when he dies his hair and it slowly drips down his back, the way he dances you can see his mind slowly slipping away into utter madness. People need to go into a movie and stop basing it on real life. I understand some people may have mental health issues which is not to be taken lightly. But this is a film it's not real it's a story of a sad man who turned to violence. If people do not have the ability to understand fictional stories from reality then why go to the movies! Where most films are fictional!!! Not everyone who watches a film takes it so serious lighten up and just enjoy the film!! We cant be afraid all the time to show certain things in movies for fear that it may make people do bad things. Movies don't make people bad. PEOPLE make people bad."
5212,"A good drama movie.
Joaquin made it great.
He did his role with every muscle he has."
5213,"""Joker""
Portrays mental illness in a society about to explode with the divisions between haves and have-nots. I expected a movie like ""The Stand"".
This was better, like a disguise in title.....
Depressing in the beginning, it slowly builds understanding and perhaps sympathy of the focal character. It has definite ""A Clockwork Orange"" feel to it. Similar in dysfunction, similar in ultra violence.
Could the portrayal be the trajectory of the United States?"
5214,"This is my first review ever on imdb, actually am reviewing right now because of this movie, I rated this movie10/10 even before watching it , but after watching the movie I changed my mind and i want to give it 20/10 , its un amazing work amazing art its really a masterpiece, and am recommended all the people to watch it."
5215,"Watch it if you're DC fan or crime drama .
I'd recommend it highly to both DC and Marvel fans"
5216,"I Saw this movie yesterday and This version of the joker Scares Me to be Honest That means I think Joaquin Phoenix performance as the joker deserve a Oscar in my opinion, This is the most Darkest DC movie I have ever Seen in my entire life But I highly Recommend it this movie Let's just say that this is the Best DC Rated R movie Ever Made"
5217,"I walked into the cinema with high hopes and I left completely fulfilled. I'm a massive Batman fan - both in comics, movies and television - and I was eager to see this latest iteration. I've enjoyed many portrayals of the Joker, from Nicholson to Ledger to Hamill. Each one showcases a different element of the Joker.Joaquin manages to present another side, whilst drawing from many aspects of the previous iterations. He plays on the mental side, showcasing a Joker developed out of circumstance. I feel Ledger's ambiguous Joker worked fantastically - which left you querying his reasons and mentality. This Joker is outright - you know his motivations and the film is a rollercoaster depicting that journey. He's a broken man with the weight of the world becoming overbearing - his fantasies so real that when they come crashing down with reality even I could sympathise with him.The art, setting and location were fantastic. Gotham felt real and dangerous, exactly as I'd picture a pre-Batman Gotham. The depiction of Thomas Wayne felt unique in that he was depicted more as a Trump-style capitalist rather than benevolent philanthropist although as his depiction is from the perspective of Arthur, it's possible he may not be as bad as depicted.I get the criticism based around the violence and how it utilises mental illness - it's very much topical and given recent and past events it was always going to dip into controversy. But I feel that it will be appreciated more once it settles. It is perhaps the ""Killing Joke"" of Joker movies."
5218,This movie is no joke. The best movie I've ever seen about how bad mental health issues can get. Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix just made a masterpiece! A truly dark piece of art. I'm Looking forward to seeing this one again. A+++
5219,"Insane, gritty, and darkly beautiful in it's own comical way....joker is one hell of a character study that injects pure chaos straight into your eyes and makes you perturbed. Phoenix's masterful showcase of Arthur's descent into madness is powerful, and loudly screams for an oscar nomination."
5220,Film of the year! If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win a Oscar I'm gonna be really shocked cause he's great.
5221,A magnificent cynosure of a performance from Joaquin Phoenix in a film that sacrifices Character development in other areas to direct it 100% towards feeding a raw energy into Arthur Fleck's delicate descent into darkness .... the spotlight of the Joker.
5222,Way darker than the dark Knight. I didn't even realize that it was more than two hours movie. Cinematically beautiful. Love it..
5223,"Never been so memorised by an actors performance, Phoenix deserves every award for this film that he can get, I don't think any one will top his performance off in a joker film."
5224,"Amazing acting! This movie makes you uncomfortable to confront the pain and mental struggles of the Joker. Phoenix nails his portrayal of the dark journey of the Joker that leads to chaos. This is not a marvel or superhero movie, if that is what you are looking for, look else where. This is an amazing cinematic journey through the cracked mind of the Joker."
5225,"Finally an origin story on DC's and perhaps the most iconic bad guy of the comic universe comes to the big screen. Like the mask on the infamous clown, the movie paints a deep portrayal of a misunderstood individual and society's qualms towards mental health. For decades, the Joker has been the bane to Batman and Gotham City, but here we see that Gotham City failed Arthur Fleck and created the Joker we have grown accustomed too . Joaquin Phoenix's powerful performance no doubt changes the Joker from villain to victim and hopefully one of an Oscar winner."
5226,"This movie has a dark and gritty atmosphere that works with the tragedy that is Arthur Fleck/ Joker in this adaptation of the clown prince of crime, this is a beatifully dark tale of descent into madness and how society treats mental illness, ending in a masterpiece of a crescendo that screams Joker in all the right ways."
5227,This movie lives up to the hype!!! Hands down no question the best played Joker. Smart. Original. Made to see in theaters. If you want wow this it. This is not a comic book movie it's an Oscar winning film. This will blow your mind.
5228,"I rarely review films but felt compelled to leave a review for this masterpiece. Believe the hype, this film is a triumph and I left the cinema in awe. JP is amazing and I'm sure he'll bag an Oscar for his performance. Please go and watch this film."
5229,"I though that nobody is gonna match the way that Heath Ledger played Joker , I was so wrong ."
5230,Don't believe the rubbish that has came out on this film being dangerous. It is a fantastic film and phoenix is phenomenal as the joker. I do hope to see more from him in this role but I'd be just as happy if this is it.
5231,This movie changes my whole perspective on life and death. Maybe it will change yours too. Other than that it's a movie you don't want to miss.
5232,"This is a dark drama....if you dont appreciate what you see then go and watch nutty professor or american pie, this movie is simply a Masterpiece of art
The Script, Acting, Camera man, Music..... till u get to the director all together combined together as a perfect symphonyAt the end I am happy that we are in 2019 ans still watching this kind of movies! Phoenix congrats for winning the Oscar! If not then something in this planet is wrong"
5233,"This is the first time I felt the ""need"" to write a review!
What an epic take on a comic book character! So unique. Such a realistic approach.
Phoenix's performance was amazing. Worthy of an Oscar.
The use of music in the movie is like an extra character.
A memorable moviegoing experience"
5234,I did not have high hopes going to this movie.. but the movie was amazing! I loved the way they potrayd Joker. And the actor is just amazing. Its a great experiens!
5235,"The best directed movie so far. The performance of joaquin phoenix is extraordinary. His talent is beyond great. This role is perfectly written for him. The best actor of our generation! The character is so emotional and deep, so ... complex... but Joaquin made it his own! I am still fascinated by his performance"
5236,"Going into the cinema I expected to give this 8 or 9 out of 10 because I know Joaquin Phoenix is a 5 star actor and I read several reviews of this movie before, most praised the cinematography. I came out from it with a 11/10 if possible.This is not just a movie. From score, story to cinematography, everything has been crafted so beautifully. But what struck me so hard is the acting, especially Joaquin Phoenix. I don't see him at all on the screen, Joaquin is totally disappeared. All I see is Joker, a character so complex and so real. From the legs shaking, sometimes hands tapping down to the way his eyebrow raising, it's a perfect Joker.Now that the movie has ended, so is Joker. You would not see even a bit of it on Joaquin Phoenix. That's the epitome of great actor."
5237,"This is understandably a split reaction for people because the movie isn't made for everyone. It's dark, depressing, and makes you question what is and isn't real in your mind. Everything is very well executed and performances are top notch. Phoenix's commitment to the role is phenomenal and is definitely worth the Oscar buzz."
5238,We need more movies like this. Does a monster become one or is it born like this? And who gets to decide what a monster is? Society?
5239,"THE ATMOSPERE IS UNMATCHED THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE, INFACT IT IS NOW MY FAVOURITE MOVIE BY FAR OMG"
5240,"Every frame is an art.
I don't believe this is for the general crowd..
This will be played and replayed tons of times in art schools."
5241,"Don't watch the movie if you don't like DC comics and don't know about The Joker...if you read and know about DC comicbooks then you'll enjoy the movie at it's best.
I am amazed...I was hyped as hell for the movie and when it started I was really really surprised. Man progressively I was just amazed. I can't explain myself, it had the emotion...no movie can ever give it to you."
5242,"This is a masterpiece. Heath Ledgers role as the Joker was insane to say the least, i didn't think it could be topped.Well. Here we have an actor that just did.It's not exactly the same character. But Pheonix sure as hell puts his insanity mode to the max."
5243,Epic performance by Phoenix. Great job by Todd Phillips. The hype is real. It it so dark so twisted and I loved it. A cross of dark night seven and king of comedy and taxi driver. All stired in a pot and out came a spectacular movie. The murders are so well done and haunting. Must watch
5244,"First review I've ever done on iMdB but I have to say this to everyone, this film is a marmite film; people will either love it or hate it.Many people will go in with the expectations of being on-par with The Dark Knight, but these two films are completely incomparable in their own right.The Dark Knight is a COMIC film, it involves all the action and all the pieces of comic stories put into an action masterpiece, and Heath Ledger's performance is extraordinary as the clown prince of crime.Joker is an extremely disturbing, dark yet invigorating film which shines the light less on the impact of Bruce Wayne and the Joker's battle with one another - it instead showcases an ill mans descent into madness, and shows how his past-experiences have effected him throughout his troubled life. Personally, I think if they moved away from some of the DC-orientated parts of the film it would've been better, but.. it is a film about THE JOKER.Overall I am absolutely amazed with Joaquin Phoenix's performance, it is truly Oscar-Winning and his portrayal consists mainly of the characters ill-nature rather than a complete psychopath.Should you go and see this film? YES.
But don't compare it to The Dark Knight, this film is not an action film, it is a gripping thriller and a dramatic masterpiece."
5245,"The movie focused on so many important features that most people will experience atleast once in their lifetime. It showed outstanding scenes of someone suffering with mental health, bullying, gun violence, the health/support system in the US, poverty, growing up without a father and abuse. The movie was incredible but deep! I loved the quotes said throughout the movie it gave the audience such an inside look on someone who sees so differently of the world because of what they've been through. The role was played perfectly I actually fell in love with Arthur and to the critics please remember it's not a Dark Night movie it's the beginning of the Jokers era."
5246,"The Joker is a masterpiece, the acting, the cinematics, the soundtrack and the storie are unbelievable. Out of all patterns. Although I did not see where Robert Deniro fits, all actors gave 💯. Congratulations everyone"
5247,"First Hit: Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is powerfully twisted in overt and subtle ways.Arthur Fleck (Phoenix, aka Joker) works as a clown. Living with his mom Penny (Frances Conroy) in a dark Gotham low rent slum apartment, he's very thoughtful of his mother's inability to take care of herself. He has a semi-secret wish to become a standup comedian and bring smiles and joy to everyone.
While watching his favorite program, The Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) Show, he fantasizes about appearing on the show and becoming famous.In an opening scene, Fleck standing and dancing in front of a going out of business shoe store twirling a sign to entice people to visit the store. He's got his clown outfit on, face painted, and seems to enjoy what he's doing. This is the first sign of the subtle way Phoenix shares the depth of his character. There is a glint in the facial expressions that give the audience a notion that all is not right with him. He gets mugged by some kids who take his sign and, in the chase, ends up being beaten.He gets reprimanded by the company (HaHa) he works for because the sign was broken, and the shoe company wants it back.Beaten by the young thugs, a fellow clown employee, Randall (Glenn Fleshler), gives Fleck a gun for protection.We learn that Fleck has an inappropriate behavior of laughing at the wrong times when he's feeling tense. He carries a card that he hands people stating his illness.The film digs a little into his mental state with scheduled visits to a city-run social worker who can and does, prescribe a litany of drugs. The social worker, at one of their meetings, tells him the city is stopping this program, and he won't be able to get his drugs through them any longer. He plows into a dialogue about how the social worker never listens to him, askes him the same questions each and every meeting. Here again, the audience knows he's right, but we also are seeing ways that he's slipping through the cracks.This is one of the points of the film. Society in this story is one of the struggles between the haves and have-nots. Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), father of the young Bruce Wayne, and a wealthy man believes that people that don't have anything need to pull themselves up from their bootstraps. He's also running for mayor. It is here and in other places this film touches on today and our current societal state of affairs where the top 1% of the people own 90% of the wealth.This point runs through this film. The story is filled with moments that reflect how society has become lawless, and there is an uncaring towards our fellow man.A turning point in the film is when Fleck, after being fired for bringing a gun to a clown gig in a children's ward of a hospital, he starts laughing while watching a tense encounter between three young drunk well-to-do businessmen who are harassing a young woman on a subway train.His inappropriate laughing causes the men to start picking on him, and during the resulting fight, he shoots and kills all three. Poignantly this attack becomes a rallying cry for the poor and disenfranchised in Gotham. All they see are the headlines that a man with a clown face (mask or makeup) stood up to three of the ""haves"" and now there is a slow movement of people having protest marches and rioting with many of the participants wearing clown masks.This story is complicated, just like Fleck is complex. Being hunted by the police for the killings, learning about his past through his mother, then through records at a mental hospital, and being off his medication creates a man who is acting out of anger, loss, and desperation.When Murray shows and then posts on social media, a hilarious video of him attempting to do a standup routine, he becomes a laughingstock across the country. However, the viralness of the post, Murray decides to have Fleck on his program.The depth and complexity of the film, the character, and the way it puts a realness to the ""Joker"" (DC Comics' character) was profound. It's almost a perfect layup to Heath Ledger's version of the Joker in ""The Dark Knight,"" with Christian Bale being Bruce Wayne. The scenes and sets in this film are wonderfully shot. The mental hospital, the social worker's office, Flecks apartment, and the street scenes all carried the sense of a troubled world.Phoenix absolutely became this character. The overt and subtle shifts in his eyes and mouth said so much throughout the film. As someone who was disregarded by society, he ended up being the man of the moment. He kept me on the edge of wondering what he will in each scene. De Niro was oddly a curious character and excellent as an aging talk show host. He, partially, reminded me of his role as Rupert Pupkin, a wanna be talk show host, in ""The King of Comedy."" Zazie Beetz, as Sophie Dumond, Fleck's neighbor, and short-term lover was outstanding. The way she saw Fleck as someone who could relate to her was powerfully displayed when they went out, and she saw his comedy routine. Conroy, as Arthur's mother, was good in this subtle, yet pivotal role. Cullen as Wayne was a perfect reflection of a have's arrogance. Fleshler, as a manipulative friend and co-worker of Fleck, was excellent in this protective backstabbing role. Todd Phillips and Scott Silver wrote a power-packed script and screenplay. Phillips directed this story with absolute clarity of delivering the story he wanted to make.Overall: I fell into this story from the very beginning, and it worked."
5248,"I could not call this movie, I feel I saw a representation of what we live today. In how the one with the greatest power has the fortune of living relaxed without any concern to what is around them when those who do not have to live day to day with the disgusting reality.In my filmmaker eyes:
Joaquin Phoenix ran the movie by himself. His job was to bring this magnificent work of art to success and he achieved it. Giving the best performance of his career and marking it in the hearts of the filmmakers. Giving this amazing performance, from the Clown Prince of Crime, Phoenix gives us the origin of one of the best villains of all time and teaches us what is lived today. A work which is deserved to many awards, mainly an Oscar. ""Heath ledger would be proud of you Phoenix""This could not be better without an excellent and wonderful music group. The soundtrack of the movie is something that is injected into our veins and does not let us stop from the awkward seat or to go to the bathroom in the movie theater. It is shocking how in every certain minute of this we are so rich to hear music from Hildur Gudnadottir. The Oscar prize would look good in your hands.The light and color of the amazing Lawrence Sher is a gift and surprise. Every volume and scene is rich to see and how every detail has its focus on this work of art.Todd Philips ... You left me speechless at the end of the movie. You are a genius, a great filmmaker and creator. Those 8 minutes of applause at the Venice Film Festival were well deserved. You achieved an unfathomable classic and we as fans of the villain and the cinema are extremely grateful to give us so much pleasure to see this piece.In the end... Joker has all the factors that a movie needs to be perfect. It is real, and although it has received hatred for being a piece that shows us the truth. At some time or another someone or something was going to show us the truth and here it is. We are living in a society where he who has power is the most valuable. And we, middle class or poor are nothing for this world. And it is thanks to that that there are many people with mental problems, which they themselves are not to blame...10/10"
5249,"I guess we all need to be an a adult and look at this film for what the Joker truly is.
As the tv series implied in a ""clean way"" and Cesar Romero always giving the slight innuendo clues.He is quite psychotic.
He is really not nice at all.
He is extremely vile.
He kills.
He is quite the villain.Contradiction, no joke at all.Phoenix took us there correctly. Wow!
Do I see Oscar?"
5250,"I tried to lower my expectations before watching this movie, with little success. But when I left the cinemas this evening, I was still in awe at how good this movie was. ""Joker"" was one of the most anticipated movies of this year, and it certainly lives up to the hype, and exceeds my expectations by miles.As good as this movie was, ""Joker"" was a tough movie to sit through. It was very disturbing at times, because you never knew when the main character, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), was going to...break. Right from the start, it is made perfectly clear that this guy is not normal at all, in fact we are told that he was a psychopath, and that he used to be locked up because of that. And as we see Arthur do his everyday routine, we also see how weird, abnormal, and sometimes even frightening, he is. And so that puts you on the edge of your seat, waiting for him to go fully berserk, and that made this movie an extremely intense and rough watch.Despite this movie being about a superhero franchise villain, it doesn't really feel like that. For one reason, that is because this Joker doesn't look like any Joker we've seen before, because this is an original take on the Joker's backstory. But for another reason, it is because it's really just a movie about a guy who doesn't fit into social norms, and how he gets treated terribly because of that. ""Joker"" isn't a typical blockbuster movie, it's a lot deeper and meaningful than that.The movie's soundtrack is great, it really makes us feel like we're trapped in this psychotic box with the main character, and it gives you an uneasy feeling. The acting from everyone is great, and Joaquin Phoenix delivers yet another Oscar-worthy performance. The cinematography and editing both suit this movie extremely well, they give it depth and, as I said, doesn't make the movie feel like yet another blockbuster superhero movie. Todd Philips proves himself to be a talented director after all, and I'm looking forward to seeing what more he can do in the future.Watch this movie in the cinemas while you can, it's really the best movie-watching experience you can get, and ""Joker"" really deserves that, and you do too."
5251,An Oscar. That is exactly what this movie deserves!
5252,"Joker is a very brilliantly constructed piece of Cinema which binds the viewer from start till the end movie perfectly showcases the making of an anti hero for the people of Gotham city who are discriminated by the rich ones with beautiful cinematography gripping soundtrack and masterpiece performance by Joaquin Phoenix
Joker is surely a academy award Steeler for the year and one of the best movie witnessed Soo far"
5253,"What an amazing movie deserves 10/10 with no question whatsoever. No comparison with any other joker , he and heath take the top for sure. It's the perfect mix of the darkness and comedy of the society we are living in in a  up way."
5254,"I'm not a harsh critic, nor am I a huge comic book fan. I don't know of the intrinsic politics between the batman comics and the films, as I only know the basic dynamics between Batman and Joker. I feel that the film has done very well in tying up any loose threads and plausible theories of Joker's origins.
The great thing about this film is that it does not want to definitively label or force Joker's origins into: 'I AM Joker, half brother of Bruce Wayne.' Or 'I am Joker, this IS where I've come from.' The film opens up unconfirmed avenues and at a logical guess, toys with the hardcore fans on what the true reality of Joker's life is to be. Nevertheless, it brings a certain ambiance and concept to Joker's origin, which is the best thing we as viewers can hope for.This film can also be applauded since it is a standalone film from any comic book adaption franchises, so in essence, this film is simply about a mentally ill man's descent into complete meltdown and chaos.Praise must be given to Phoenix for opting to portray such an iconic character, and not only for the portrayal, but for attempting to accurately portray the deterioration of mental health. Several blog posts are now being born as to which actor is the best Joker...I believe that this film CANNOT be pushed into this debate.To my knowledge, no other actor has had to portray the man behind Joker, or his origins for longer than 30 minutes. Therefore, Joaquin Phoenix as Joker has bought about a new debate: which actor is best at portraying Arthur Fleck? Right now, it can only be Phoenix. This is the point that I feel is being missed right now.As to the ending of the film, Joker in the white room, was the film's events it all reported speech? An hallucination? A fabrication? My opinion, and my only non-obtrusive opinion is that all events had existed except for hallucinations that are made obvious. So, the only speculations that can exist are: is Joker related to Batman? Was Thomas Wayne a crook? Who were Joker's true parents? Yet the most curious art of this scene, is the flashback to Bruce standing with his shot parents... this can only mean that Joker already had a plan of revenge against the Wayne family to even be thinking about the child of Thomas Wayne. Whether or not his adoptive mother had an affair with Thomas or not, it is clear that Joker as a certain amount of resentment, anger towards the Wayne family.An only criticism I can find is the film's classification here in the UK. Here it is rated a 15, which I feel may be Inappropriate. I'm all for the encouragement of mental health awareness, but the way this film invites the viewer into Joker's mental health could be very impressionable onto a 15/16 year-old viewer who also struggles with mental health. I feel that the film should be an 18 but, Hollywood + money = ignorance.Overall, this film brings a very positive, curious insight to an iconic villain of Gotham, and we can hope that future films take these curiosities further. Although, given that Joker is a very unstable, unreliable character for truth, it would be shame for any film for comic to give Joker a definitive backstory."
5255,"The reality of this movie is exceptional, in a world of too much cgi I loved this movie."
5256,Great performances and extremely strong stroy line
5257,"3 observations1. This film is exhausting to watch. It pulls on every emotion for the entire duration and leaves you questioning your own morals, ethics and world view2. It is by far the finest characterisation in modern cinema - Phoenix is utterly brilliant, every second of every minute he is on screen.3. You can't help but think with the world in such a precarious state, this is a dangerous film. The usual random, motiveless or opportunistic portrayal of crime is replaced with a narrative that draws empathy and support. The things that underpin the characters development happen in real life, in every city, in every country, the world over. Joker dares to suggest there is an alternative and lays out the blueprint.Enjoy the film, it is truly a masterpiece but don't be surprised if clowns become popular again. 😀"
5258,"That violence,
That music,
That cinematography,
Thi is fu**ing masterpiece.
You must watch it..
Careful guys.., because he is Joker."
5259,"Joker is a multi-layered film with many great elements put together. It's a psychological thriller and drama disguised as a comic book movie. It's something DC has done better instead of presenting a pure comic story, e.g. The Dark Knight (a crime drama) or Aquaman (action fantasy).The first layer is one man's descent to madness. Joaquin Phoenix masterfully takes us into Arthur Fleck's journey day by day until he finally becomes the Joker. The tics, the change of personality, his liberation is so realistic. Phoenix disappears into his role and becomes Fleck. You don't see the actor anymore but the character. For this reason alone, Phoenix is deserving an Oscar already.The second layer is the critique of society. Gotham is in shambles, everyone is out for himself, and the economy has gone south. What causes the viewers to sympathize is the lack of compassion because people like Fleck need help. In fact, I find the film a criticism on the lack of universal health care in the USA.The third layer is the dearth of people sympathetic to Fleck. There are only 2 with one who actually lied and hurt him in past. With no support group, Fleck's condition can't be helped.The fourth layer is the unreliable narrator Fleck is. You don't know which scenes are true. In fact, you don't even know if the entire story is true. Or is it really in Fleck's head?Other aspects:The cinematography creates a personal relation w/ the main character. It's in your face but not obtrusive. Everything seems like you're in the same room as Fleck.The fifth music adds dimension to Fleck's descent. It's gloomy at first. It ends towards being menacing and frightening. It also adds to the delusion Fleck is in.The screenplay is excellent. The story is slow at the start but goes faster towards the end. There are scenes which are frightening and tense but somehow elicit some inappropriate laughter like the door lock w/c Fleck's midget colleague can't reach.Because I watched in a Dolby Atmos theatre, the sound was great. This was best when Fleck shoots people. It was shocking to hear a gun go off like you were in the scene.The film's director deserves an Oscar for direction. The risky vision and concept paid off. This film makes you think because it makes you uncomfortable. Again, it's not just because of the violence inflicted upon Fleck and his pushback, but also the possibility of being a story made up in Fleck's head. You really don't get the joke.Overall, this film deserves Oscars for Best Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actor (Brett Cullen as Thomas Wayne, despite the limited minutes), Editing, Screenplay, Cinematography, and Musical Score."
5260,"""...Are you having any negative thoughts? all I have... are negative thoughts "" that's one of the eeriest lines I've heard in a while.I've read a lot of critics bash this movie, it's really sad to see critics missing the artistry behind this film. The Script, the directing, the lighting, the acting made such a neat work.The realism in this movie is what made it work so well. Had it not been so gritty and real, this film would've been a mess. Every single crime done is an actual CRIME. There's no desensitization, It's a gritty crime, and it's disturbing as it should be.However it gave me and ,from what I read, a lot of people a worrisome feeling that some psychopath watched this movie with us and might get triggered. You leave the theater kind of worried.Phoenix's performance is too much, and I mean it in a good way. You can almost hear Arthur's thoughts just by looking at him, the disturbance, the narcissism, the anger, the madness, and the ""negative thoughts"". Truly an Oscar worthy performance.
This film tackles many problems in modern day American society such as gun control, mental illness in social services, the poverty gap. It does it in a good way, but not the best way. At the end of the day the film claims to be a comic book movie.Which brings me to why I deducted two points from the 10/10. This movie dealt with a character study that could've been any psychopath and it stapled the comic book , influential, criminal mastermind ""Joker"" on it... there's no way this joker will ever have a decent ""evil"" plan. This joker is a psychopath that wants retaliation on the world, like all narcissistic psychopaths want.Somehow I felt this movie would be a good prequel to ""Once Upon A Time in Hollywood "" (just the ending)
This Joker is no agent of ""chaos"". And his influence on the masses is unreasonable, but someone is going to say ""come on! It's a comic book movie!!"" #x22; Or "" is it?...is it really a comic book movie ?""Still great film, go watch it"
5261,This movie is everything i had hoped for.Perfect mixture of drama and thriller along with the brilliant performance of Joaquin
5262,"When the initial teaser trailer came out, 6 months ago or however long it may be, I was skeptical of this take on the ""Joker"". The final trailer for it intrigued me massively, and I thought wow, this actually looks pretty good. Then the initial reviews came out, the fact it had gotten a standing ovation in 8 minutes, surely it is all hype? Surely it isn't THAT good?Boy was I wrong, Joker is a tremendous film, that is what sets it apart from other ""comic"" movies, this is not a great movie based on a comic character, it is a great film overall, period. Phoenix' acting is utterly stupendous, breathtaking, and worthy of an Oscar no doubt. The movie itself is dark, disturbing, gritty, and uncomfortable at times, and leaving the cinema, this is one of the rare movies which made me think about what I had seen in a deep manner. Can't wait to watch it again.Joker. 10 stars. Masterclass. Phenomenal."
5263,Went into the film with unrealistic expectations and scepticism and left having my unrealistic expectations exceeded and a longing to watch it again
5264,"The movie is depressing from the first scene when Arthur gets jumped trying to make a the bare minimum of a living. Already being depressive, every interaction with other people is driving him further into a corner.In the train scene he is trying to look away as the three bankers start harassing the young woman but his uncontrollable laughter draws their attention to him. Again, he's the one being attacked but this time he's being pushed over the edge and commits his first kill(s).He doesn't feel remorse or guilt, which makes every following kill easier. Philipps sets the joker up as an anti hero out for revenge, killing people who harmed him in the past but letting the ones nice to him live. The scene in his apartment when his little colleague tries to open the door chain is one of the tensest moments I've seen in a movie.Without spoiling too much, Arthur trancends more and more into madness, realizing his whole life he has been lied to and abused.The increasing violence shows his decreasing respect for human life. He starts to hurt innocent people (he's suddenly no longer living in his apartment but in his ""girlfriends"") but the movie leaves open what has happened to her and her daughter.My only complain would be that the genius of the joker is missing. He acts impulsive and emotional, getting caught by police and not planning in advance. This for me is the biggest caveat as it makes it difficult tounderstand how the joker will become the crimal mastermind portrayed in the Batman movies.Phoenix performance is absolutely brilliant, but does not beat Heath Ledger"
5265,Simply historical Phoenix performance. Complex character.
5266,"In filim Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is standing in a decrepit elevator with his neighbour Sophie (Zazie Beetz) and her daughter. The lights are flickering, and the lift almost comes to a halt. In irritation, Sophie mentions that the building is beyond repair. She does the iconic finger-gun to the head, to show how hopeless the situation is. Arthur smiles.The elevator begins to work again and they reach the required floor. Just before he reaches his door, Arthur returns the gesture. They part ways. She smiles understandingly.There's nothing more to that scene. But it's uncomfortable. It makes you squirm, and you don't know why. But apart from the fraying mindset, it's a dark indication of the events that will follow in the film.Joker, directed by Todd Phillips, is the origin story of one of the most baffling and iconic DC villains. Through the decades, the character has been given numerous flourishes, and each actor has brought something new to the villain. We've seen Cesar Romero's playful prankster, Jack Nicholson in Batman (1989) and no one can forget Heath Ledger's dark and sadistic portrayal of the Joker. Ledger's characterisation of the Joker in Dark Knight set a benchmark, which, it was believed, no one could touch. After the forgettable performance of Jared Leto in Suicide Squad, Phoenix brings the Joker to life again in a terrifying, haunting and unsettling performance.It is the 1980s. There is an ongoing class war in the city of Gotham. The privileged like Thomas Wayne make paltry statements about poverty, while the ones pushed to the periphery of society like Arthur Fleck and his ailing mother Penny remain invisible. Arthur tries to earn a living for himself as a clown, but is ridiculed and beaten up. In short, he is at the hands of a system that cannot, or rather refuses to see him. And slowly, the thin mask of sanity that he struggles to hold to the world, slips throughout the film. A family secret hastens his descent into madness. The lines between real and hallucinations become blurred. It leads to a powerful climax, with an ending that rivals a black satirical comedy.Philips has received strong backlash for making a film about inciting violence in 2019, a year when there have been more than 300 mass shootings in US itself. It was said to be the typical whitewashed story of a lone wolf resorting to mass murder, because he was shunned by society. When posed with the question about inciting violence, Phoenixhimself had left an interview as he later said that ""he had not thought about that"".But is the answer so black and white? The Joker while attempting to humanise the antagonist in the beginning, doesn't glorify him. The twinge of empathy and sympathy dissolves through the film, and there is a sense of fear of the monster Arthur devolves into. The film also seems to be a strange warning of the dangers of unchecked mental illness and the effects it can have on an individual's moral, physical and emotional make-up.The Joker is a one-man show, with extended cameos by Robert De Niro and Zazie Beetz. Phoenix is hypnotic and astonishing with his performance, which definitely does merit an Oscar. His eyes haunt you. They show his struggle with his inner demons. It's not often that you find an actor who can give you gooseflesh with every movement that is considered joyful, like dancing or just laughing. Phoenix pulls some demonic dance moves down a stairway; the same stairway where he had once walked alone and miserable.His laughs as the Joker are anything but funny, and there are a variety of them. There's the high-pitched cackle, and there's the hoarse guffaw which hides the sobs. His laugh has no joy in it. It just shows how dead he is on the inside.The film has its fair share of flaws of course, and there are some scenes forced into the film. Thomas Wayne's speech on poverty; another one where Arthur meets a young Bruce Wayne, which might confuse the timelines for a few, are among the problematic parts of Joker. The rich and elite have no greys in their personality, to the extent that some dialogues get repetitive.The Joker is a deeply unsettling social commentary on a ravaging class divide, as well as a warning sign for mental illness. It is not for everyone. But it will definitely bring about a lot of conversation."
5267,"Now THIS is what I'm talking about. This is what I thought ""Venom"" was going to be and I so wish it was. Joaquin does an amazing performance with so many subtleties that make his character complex and intriguing. The story has so many twists and turns and can be interpreted in many different ways. Me and my husband are still talking about what it all meant a day later. Don't read any spoilers! Best to go in blindly and pay close attention. The only reason I rated 9 instead of 10 stars is for the pacing of the film. Both me and my husband felt that the first half was a bit too slow while the second half seemed a bit rushed. Otherwise it was an excellent movie that will for sure be remembered for many years to come."
5268,"I love Joaquin Pheonix and when I learned he was playing Joker I had to see this film. It is not a perfect masterpiece and neither is it that so bad like the snowflake review bombing critics are making it out to be. The acting, cinematography, and music are goosebumps inducing. The story is also nice. Please go watch it. The weak points are a certain female character that wasn't explored more, and a certain unnecessary sub plot which I am not going to spoil and let you judge for yourself. Overall very enjoyable movie and Joaquin's Joker is a worthy successor to the great Heath Ledger's Joker. Hope Pheonix wins or gets nominated for an oscar for this chilling performance as the Joker."
5269,"Believe the hype, it is indeed a masterpiece. As a keen observer of films, this goes right in the Top 10 Movies ever made across timelines.This should definitely win an academy for male actor, cinematography, original score and direction."
5270,One of the best films I've ever seen and Joaqhin was AMAZING! I LOVED THE JOKER.
5271,Where do I begin. This movie was AMAZING! Definitely an award winning performance for sure. A different take on the joker but I think it works. The cinematography and story fit right in with the character. Fantastic job!
5272,"I approached this movie with high expectations, and those expectations were blown out of the water. I have always been a big fan of Phoenix, as I believe he is a tremendously versatile actor who consistently delivers top quality performances. This was, without any doubt, his piece de resistance.The audience immersed themselves into a character development like no other. From start to finish we were engrossed in the mind of a highly volatile, yet sympathetic character. Phoenix succeeded in making the Joker his own. It would have been very easy to mimic the remarkable style of Ledger, yet Phoenix's portrayal of vulnerability makes this performance incredibly unique.Daniel Day Lewis set the bar for method acting, Joaquin Phoenix has now raised that bar. Christian Bale's performances in American Psycho, The Machinist and Harsh Times all have merit with regards to roles pertaining to the dark side of mental illness. Joker takes this genre to a new level. This psychological thriller is perhaps the most captivating movie you are likely to have seen. Superb."
5273,"To be honest, I only went to see this done over movie, because Loaquin Phoenix was in it, boy was I surprised! If you have ever known persons with Pseudobulbar or Schizophrenia, you know how the media usually depicts it wrong or goes overboard with it; however ""Joker"" gets it right in my opinion. A man in a society trying to do the right thing, taking care of mom, keeping a job, being a productive member of society... Pushed and bullied and having the things that make one sane stripped from one, causes chaos in the mind, they got it right! Overacting; NO WAY! Every scene spot on, the story, dialog, graphics, acting, directing, videography, production, makeup, etc... I rarely root for ""The Bad Guy,"" this time is an exception. Well done everybody, well done!"
5274,Joachim Phoenix deserves an academy award for playing such a complex character.
5275,Thank God someone had the balls to make a dark film that's not trying to make some political statement. You will come put disturbed and confused but at the end of the day it'll make you think about the descent of madness. The reason I give it a solid 9 is because I don't find it to be a rewatchable film. It's something I'd watch a a third time but certainly for a second. Worth the watch
5276,"Best film I've seen in a long time
it is gritty, suspense and amazing
Joaquin Phoenix's performance is the best performance in a long time
Also, the cinematography was outstanding and the music score is haunting and excellent
This movie needs to win best picture, best actor, best director, best original screenplay and best cinematography"
5277,"Amazing movie, and I would like to watch it again :)"
5278,"The current user review here on IMDB, 9.1, is indicative of how great this movie is. Don't go off of RT reviews or other online critics. The user reviews have it right. Amazing movie for sure."
5279,Impactant and amazing. Joaquim Phoenix is fantástic.
5280,"The Joker is back and he's great. A great beginning with hopefully more to come. Focusing on acting more than action, it's an enjoyable if not disturbing film and any fan of DC should love this film. It inevitably leaves you wanting more and I look forward to seeing him again. Hahahahaha hahahaha hahahaha haha."
5281,"Joaquin Phoenix deserves Oscar for his role as Joker. Joaquin really described how someone are depressed and has mentally health issues. With a long very closed shooting at his face, Joaquin Phoenix could show his face contorted. What a brilliant performance!"
5282,"Joaquin Phoenix What a PERFORMANCE.
The hype around this film was completely justified loved the screenplay, storytelling the emotions the acting I'm beyond amazed What an actor this Man is Joaquin has absolutely Nailed the JOKER. Showed us what the Joker as a character is all about. Heath Ledger's Joker was vastly developed in retrospect to the Criminal world while Joaquin Phoenix's Joker showed the beginning of how he actually became a psychopathic killer. And also shed light on who he was before all this."
5283,Wow dark gritty and thought provoking. So much going on. Absolutely loved it. Totally engrossed in every scene. One of the best acting roles I've seen in years. Joacquin Phoenix is top class . Plan to see this again 👍👍👍👍👍👍
5284,"Only thing I can complain regarding Joker that the way that Waynes are murdered. There is an idea behind that murder in this movie but we know that Bruce's family was killed by an ordinary, stupid thief and for nothing. This makes the transformation of Bruce to Batman reasonable. Otherwise, there is no reason for Bruce to be Batman as we see in the movie."
5285,"Heath ledger's performance as the joker will be the best interpretation of the joker by any actor!
Joaquin Phoenix was close second !
His performance was overwhelming outstanding and his portrayal was more of how the joker was born and legers was more of the joker showing how diverse and disturbing he is however that blood at the end is very iconic.
Joaquin You do deserve Osacar for these great performance. 👏👏"
5286,"Given the negative press I felt I had to write a review to do this film justice.From start to finish I loved every minute, Phoenix's acting was amazing and despite the joker's murderous antics the way his story is told allows you to understand and sympathise with him, demonstrating he is the true hero of the movie.It was a great watch and would recommend everyone to watch it too!"
5287,"My friend Shelley saw this yesterday with her hubby, and her review was, ""Wow"". That's it, just ""Wow"". After just watching it myself, I understand the full breadth and depth of ""Wow"". IMDb gave it a 9.2. There was a cop positioned inside and outside the theater. Specifically because of this movie. I am not a fan of superhero movies. Ledger's Joker was the greatest villain of all time. And Joaquin Phoenix's interpretation takes Ledger's best moments in Dark Knight and runs them through the whole movie. This is maybe one of the most terrifying pieces of art I've ever seen, for one reason; it removes the barrier, the buffer of emotional safety created by garish, comical, superhero, antic, zingers that create our suspension of disbelief. It's gone. I watched two hours of a man's break from reality, one plausible, painful, crushing, brutal event at a time. Things that you and I experienced versions of one or two, or know someone who experienced them. If even a single one of the pins pulled in all the grenades that figuratively went off in this story had been put back in place, we would have no Joker. But they all got pulled...
There's an argument brewing in the back of my mind about ""mental health and violence"", ""glorifying"" or ""shaming"", and I wouldn't begrudge anyone their feelings about ""Joker"". But look around. You should be terrified.Again, imdb 9.2. Joaquin Phoenix better get some golden paperweights, as well as writing, and directing. Because - wow."
5288,"This will definitely go down in history as a classic.
It's really an Oscar worthy movie.Mind blowing acting by Joaquin.
I seriously wish that before next Oscar no other movie with someone doing acting better than what Joaquin did (I doubt if it's even possible to act better than that.) should come so that he can win an Oscar."
5289,I've seen stories about people walking out of movie theaters because the film is too violent and it glamourizes violence. That is such crap. It depicts how a man who was nice to everyone is driven to violence. Phoenix outdid himself in this one. Absolutely fabulous.
5290,I will say if Joaquin doesn't get an oscar this year then something is wrong with this world
5291,"It was fantastically done. I was worried after the Leto incident with the character, but Phoenix did such a good job of it. An absolute masterpiece."
5292,"The acting, cinematography soundtrack AMAZING. Watching a man with a mental illness struggle in society, as real life as we're gona get with an origin story. Blew my mind, i believed the hype and expected it to be good but it still shook me.The plunge into darkness made me feel uneasy and the violent scenes had me gasping in shock. Need to go see it again!"
5293,"One of the best acting performances I have ever seen from Phoenix. Keeps you glued to your seat and it will live long in the memory, If could rate this movie higher I would. Film of the year and maybe film of the decade. 🤡"
5294,"This movie was extremely good. One of those actor driven movies made in very good taste. No constant shaky cameras, no short-hand cut scenes, no bad CGI and a lot of pure breathtaking moments (more in the second part of the movie).I usually don't give a 10, but this movie deserves every praise it can get. It managed to get so many emotions out of me that I think it deserves a spot between the greatest movies ever made.Before going to the movie, make sure you understand that this is a complete character development movie with a lot of dark and depressing moods and scenes.I take a bow to Joaquin Phoenix."
5295,"The acting, screenplay, cinematography and music are just something worth of a top 10 all time. The movie is dark and powerful with each sequence bringing more and more emotions and mixed feelings. The Joker character is simply unreal, I don't think even a crazy person can act better than Joaquin did in this representation. He's acting is so powerful that makes you really think and have mixed judgements about him. It was simply a masterpiece in terms of acting. I've seen all the Joker representations so far and I can definitely say this one is the best one, the most powerful and authentic one. Some of the scenes are also so well directed that literally give a shake on the inside, where you go like ""wtf just happened"" ! If this movie doesn't receive an oscar for best actor, directing, screenplay and music, there is something wrong right there.That scene on the stairs, the depth with those 2 agents sitting at the top, him putting a perfectly crazy dance, the music aligned with it. ""Oh my...!"""
5296,"Going to this movie i was ready to be dissaponted but i can gladly say that wasnt the case.
Phoenix's performance is one of a kind, he have it all, the sound track was perfect and gave a contrast over whats happening in the scene.
The first part of the movie is a little slow, but is layng the ground work for the astounding second half.
The only thing i have to point out (not the movies fault) is the rating in Portugal, they gave it a 14 and older, the movie should be at least a 16 and older, since the movie features some sensitive tópicos.
But overall it stands as one of the best and it probably be remenber as a movie of the decade."
5297,"The performance from Joaquin phoenix is Oscar worthy. So is the cinematography, music, script itself and so much more."
5298,"Joker (2019) delivers a masterclass of acting by Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck and tells a deep and meaningful narrative in relation to society today. Joaquin Phoenix allows the audience to not only understand and empathise with the character 'Joker', but to also feel repulsed by some of the extreme actions he takes. When critics compare it to Heath Ledger, or downplay Joaquin Phoenix's character as an incel or angry white guy, they are sorely mistaken and most likely misunderstood the narrative of the film. Heath Ledger's Joker was a brilliant take on the character but you must understand that the 2019 Joker is introduced in a more psychologically engaging manner, where we are able to directly see Arthur's life before he became the joker. Whereas in the Dark Knight, the audience is only able to see the Joker post origin. If you think about it, the Dark Knight's joker has had many years to perfect his violent strategies, but Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is quite literally about the beginning of he Joker and what caused it.Put it simply, comparing the two Jokers would be unnecessary and irrelevant as they are focusing on the character in completely different parts of their lives.
No need to attack the film because it felt uncomfortable and real, this film was designed with that in mind and to make the audience think long and hard about the society they live in, including mental illness in contemporary society."
5299,"First of all get this man an Oscar because he certainly deserves it . Man the movie was much more than I expected, after the movie ended the entire audience showed a wonderful applause because as I mentioned it's a Masterpiece . Screw all the haters saying that this movie is too violent , I admit there might be some slightly terrifying scenes but there is nothing that terrifying to leave the movie . I'm 16 years of age and I have seen much more mental and violent movies than this . I wanna thank Tod Phillips for bringing this Masterpiece to life and I hope he'll keep making more amazing movies like this in the near future . Thank you Joaquin Phoenix for bringing the joker each and everyone desperately needed ."
5300,"Joaquin pheonix's JOKER is a gritty and nightmarish character study of Travis Bickle-esque ""Arthur fleck"" aka the JOKER who descends into madness for personally justifiable reasons.The film does draw inspirations from Martin Scorsese's TAXI DRIVER and THE KING of COMEDY but it's nothing like any of them. Its actually gives us a more deeper look at Travis bickle from TAXI DRIVER.Now, let's talk about the Joaquin Pheonix..of course I can't confine my admiration for him just to an IMDB review but anyway. Joaquin's performance is absolutely brilliant, menacing and terrorizing as the JOKER. He totally gives you the creeps. Having said this, although his portrayal of the character is brutally violent towards the finish, the intentional slow burn of the film gives you enough time to know him that you can't help but empathize with the character at least in some darkest corner of your mind.Who played it best: for this I'd say until Heath ledger terrified the world with his brilliant performance in the dark Knight we couldn't think of anybody else who could play it like jack nicholson and he undoubtedly superceded jack Nicholson's portrayal in the 1989 BATMAN.And now with JOKER Joaquin undoubtedly inherited the throne Heath left.👏👏👏👏👏
Only if he were alive Heath would have lauded Joaquin's performance.thats how it works in any art form. There can be no ABSOLUTES what so ever. Ever body contributes to the medium.So i'd say kudos to Jack, Heath and JOAQUIN FREAKING PHEONIXTodd Philips I thank you so much for giving us such a great movie about the character we all love.I so so wish Matt Reeves considers Joaquin to play the joker in his upcoming Batman film if at all he plans to have a Joker in the film.Make way for GOTHAM'S new Clown Prince of Crime."
5301,First time I've heard people clapping at the end of a movie. Instant classic.
5302,"A combination of three top movies taxi driver, king of comedy and the six senses. those who appreciate Avengers movies will be disappointed. if you are under the age of 30 you should not go because you will not understand it and will not like it because joker has no superpowers. an interesting scenario full of realism that I haven't seen for many years and I didn't think Americans would do. I bet he'll win the Oscar. the problem is that those who appreciate real dramas (say almost the movie is inspired by real facts) will not go to this movie thinking it's fantasy as batman. comparing the notes given on imdb by Americans and the smaller notes given by Romanians shows the degree of culture between us and them. when it is a superficial movie like Avengers full of cartoons we give bigger notes than them."
5303,"This movie is a pure depiction of how a masterpiece looks like. Joaquin Phoenix have nailed the character of Joker. He doesn't only act from his expressions but also from his body. When Joker kills everybody, somewhere inside you know that this is not morally correct, but when you think about the sorry state of affairs with Arther Fleck, you somehow sympathize with him. That's where this movie gets into your nerves. Every single frame of this movie is a masterpiece. It shook my mind so big that I'm talking about this movie since last 3 days. The climax will blow up your mind. This movie screams for a sequel out of itself. How the society these days are not well behaved. People with mental illness finds themselves so lonely because this society never accept them. Rather they abuse them, to their limits. That's where some kind of Joker like character comes out. This movie makes you believe that there is a possibility of a Joker in this society. The society which abandons a loner and treats him like a trash. A man who was never happy in his entire life. A man who finds himself in between a kind of identity crisis. Words are less to describe how good Joaquin Phoenix has portrayed the clown prince of crime. This is the epitome of cinematic art. BRILLIANT!"
5304,"Joker is absolutely truthfully a masterpiece. The acting, the screenplay, the tone, the character development, the music is just outstanding. At the end of the movie you realize there is something more in the movie and the joker's origin is still questionable. 10/10 Joaquin desevers the Oscar for the Best actor this year."
5305,Fantastic. Phoenix nailed it. Can't wait to see it again. Different type of dc movie but in the best way .
5306,"Started off slow, but it was necessary. The whole character development was outstanding. It was dark and gritty, couldn't look away for one moment. I felt pity for joker, you really get an understanding on why he's so messed up. Joaquin Phoenix was great, it's acting that's rarely seen. Majority of actors just speak the words without having to become the character, not Joaquin... he truly becomes the psychotic villain.
I do wish the movie would have been another hour longer, maybe I'm being greedy, but I wanted even more Joaquin Phoenix as joker."
5307,"Film keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Amazing cinematography.
I am a big Dark Knight fan, but this movie makes dark knight triology look like a fairytale. Very realistic approach to comic book story telling.👌"
5308,"I was honest to god expecting a garbage truck fire, Philips hadn't exactly proved himself prior to this film, Scorsese was involved but very early on and I assumed he dropped out for good reason, we have had 3 different jokers in about 10 years and honestly the idea of a Joker origin story seemed stupid, but my god this movie works, it's fantastic, a must see and definitely an oscar contender"
5309,"Arthur Fleck (Joker) is a mentally ill man whose illness and medications are documented, but unfortunately fall through the cracks of society. Sounds all too familiar in today's world. Phoenix is brilliant as he takes us on a dark journey from picked on loner to delusional murderer. There is definitely a Taxi Driver and King of Comedy influence on the film and Batman Begins as the movie takes place in a dreary time in a major metropolis. The connection to Bruce Wayne is interesting as well as the reason for the Joker's laugh. This is a dark movie may not be for everyone but to me deserves at least a 9 out of 10."
5310,"How much we missed for this kind of film. Joaquin and the character JOKER I see a beautiful chemistry between this two characters.
Thank DC for this movie.
HKM."
5311,"This is my first review ever. I had to do it. I just wanna thank Joaquin and the director for having given us such an extraordinary masterpiece. And if Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar, apague y vámonos.. Ha ha ha, je je"
5312,I was riveted by Joaquin's acting. Usually I get bored midway through movies but Joaquin kept my attention the whole time. What a great actor who draws in the audience and keeps them on the edge of their seat. I'm not a fan of comic book movies but this was very good and believeable.
5313,"Although it is technically a superhero movie, it is by far the best movie in the genre. How did it do it? By not being a superhero movie.Being a psychological thriller of a character we have known for almost 80 years, that has had multiple stories about why he is as he is, we knew this movie was going to have a hard job to impress.It did it.The story is super dark, which actually is fitting for a character that kills and that tries to take a city as part of a joke. Even the few jokes that appear in the movie are not oversaturating it.The music is an astounding job. It sometimes goes too loud and over the dialog, but nothing distracting, although a couple of times unfitting.The scenography is just perfect for Gotham, a city that has less sun than England.The acting is extremely solid. Everyone gave everything they had and left their soul in this movie. Maybe in the last scenes with Robert the Niro he dropped the ball a little and the acting was a lot more stiff and less natural, but not enough to ruin the experience.The direction is in general solid. A couple of pointers in 2 or 3 scenes that are not enough to ruin the movie.The edition was great, as well as the special effects. The movie feels at times like dragging itself and artificially making itself longer, but those scenes are so rare and far in between that in general they don't ruin the experience.Just what I expected from a film that takes an actual look at mental disorders and the way society works. Great film overall, would watch again. And not many movies that have appeared in the last 10 years or so can say the same."
5314,Absolutely amazing his performance is definitely a 10 outa 10
5315,Takes a lot to get a reaction out of me. But let me tell you something about this film; Go See It.Just do yourself a favor and go see it!
5316,"Nicely done. Phoenix's interpretation of the Joker is by far one of the best I've seen. Not only is the acting Oscar worthy but the build up of the storyline is unbelievable! It depicts something real, dark while still playing into the comics character."
5317,"Who enters this movie with a DC comics mindset might get disappointed, but in return they will get another type of adventure that can be just as rewarding if they let it in.Joaquin Phoenix was given a role of a lifetime and he gave it all he could. The comparisons to Heath Ledger will be unavoidable but this performance stands on its own. His performance is brilliant at robbing the laughter from under you, leaving your emotions grasping for a solid ground that is just not there, forcing you unapologetically to the same psychological limbo of this character.This is the descent of a man that has thought he hit rock bottom only to find out there is no bottom. Throughout the movie, as both his mind and his world falls out from him, he finally lets go and embraces what every Joker knows: its all a joke and there is no punchline.I give it 8 out of 10 because the cinematography and music missed one too many opportunities to make this movie an eternal classic. So close. Maybe they were afraid to be too comedic in a film that wants to be taken seriously as a drama. It was a pity that the director did not fully embrace the chaotic and theatrical nature of the character. It begs the question: ""why so serious...""Overall, its a must see. A Joker that will burn into your thoughts and will make you think, very carefully, about who you want to send into darkness, because sometimes, they climb back out."
5318,King of it's genre! Forget that Batman is even a part of the legend for he is not even mentioned throughout the course of the film. A thrillride that will quite possibly hit home to many on several levels. Do Not Deprive Yourself!
5319,"I never thought I'd see the day when someone would portray the Joker in as captivating a way as Heath Ledger. Well, the day has come! Joaquin Phoenix's embodiment of Arthur Fleck was legendary. This is not to say that Phoenix outdid Ledger. I don't think it is truly possible to compare them side by as they are telling very different stories. Ledger's performance was a portrayal of the unhinged, psychotic, Clown Prince of Crime who wanted to watch the world burn and was done masterfully. Phoenix, on the other hand, was telling the story of Arthur Fleck, the mentally ill, awkward, dissociated yet initially pitiable man who would metamorphose into the Joker. His depiction of the Joker felt less like an evil criminal mastermind bent on destroying everything and more like Russell Crowe's depiction of John Nash in A Beautiful Mind, albeit far less beautiful, far more unnerving, and I don't believe that John Nash ever stabbed someone with scissors and beat their head into a wall. At the beginning, I empathized with Arthur Fleck. He was a man who the universe chewed up. He suffered from severe mental illness, a society on the verge of collapse and was an outcast. In the scene on the bus when he was trying to entertain the little boy until the boy's mother chastised him, I almost cried. I felt he was just defending himself in his first killings, until he chased down the last of the three men and shot him multiple times. He was relatable. I didn't find it at all difficult to follow his slow, devolving descent into hell and murder.A truly excellent movie!"
5320,"I watched JOKER with superhero trepidation.As a stout Marvel fan and and having been somewhat let down by the promise that DC were going darker following Batman Begins and The Dark Knight (killings aside), I entered the theatre wondering what kind of picture Warner brothers would present.Some of the adverts prior to the movie were drolé and tried to replicate the suggested horror and intrigue that would be presented in the film, but the copycats fell short of the truth.
Joker presents a dark and intrepid insight into the origins of one of DC's most fabled villains.
The acting by Phoenix was sublime and the setting held true to the history of the character and the references to the origins of batman were there to be seen.I do not want to dwell much on the story of the film as it would detract and deter some from witnessing this visual extravaganza and performance, and to surmise Joaquin Phoenix gives his soul to this homage and becomes truly encapsulating.
To bring this into modern context, it is a man who suffers from mental illness who loses his right to help from the government due to budget cuts whilst the over pompous capitalists drink champagne, ride in limo's and sleep in mansions whilst profiting from the lesser man. Much of this is only hinted at however and bares little influence to the piece as The Joker is not a political figure until he emerges from his metamorphis, which only occurs following a dramatic event - and this itself only happens near the end of the film.Phoenix depicts a truly delirious, deep, and troubled character haunted by the events of his family life which have echoed into his present and in some ways dictate his behavior's such as his memorable, yet haunting, uncontrollable laugh - which is well characterized in the movie.
There are a lot of comments regarding mental impairments and how this movie should have been a higher classification - but having looked at the BBFC category wording it neither dwells on any particular situation nor glorifies it - however it is a deep portrayal of a troubled and well know (sic) super villain and in the film there are at least 2 somewhat contentious moments so watch at your own {peril}.This film in my view, has been released at the most appropriate time. The world is waking up to the fact that fat cats (which include movie stars) are milking the lesser man (sic) as the societal gaps widens between rich and poor and this real life occurrence is well represented in this film."
5321,"Phoenix completely nailed the role. His transition from Arthur to Joker was so well developed, and every move he made had me on the edge of my seat. So well done, I'm practically speechless."
5322,"Just saw this movie today in the cinema and my god what a hell of a film this is. Taking place in 1981, we are introduced to the origin of The Joker in all his dark, gritty, violent, psychotic glory. The transformation of Arthur Flecks character is ground breaking. we see this poor, misunderstood man mercilessly beaten multiple times before finally lashing out taking his first steps towards becoming this infamous villain we love so much getting deeper and progressively more intense and violent as the film goes on. There are a couple moments in this film that some might find hard to watch but it's seriously not as bad as what everyone's been saying about it. in saying that, this is definitely not a film for kids.Anyone who is familiar with the Batman films will know well and truly that Bruce Wayne's (Batman's) parents are murdered in front of him in an alley way when he's still only a young boy. This film shows this event and the events leading up to it. In terms of the overall timeline of events, Joker begins roughly 3 weeks before Bruce Wayne's parents are killed.Joker carries a very dark, stylish theme just like so many batman movies have done before it. the score, cinematography and the astonishing performance by Joaquin Phoenix are some of the biggest impacts a film has had on me over the last decade. We also have some strong political messages on display here too which I will not delve into here. Leave that for the forum sites =)Joker is one truly amazing film and is sure to go down as an all time masterpiece. 10 out of 10."
5323,It is an amazing movie done by Joaquin Phoenix. The antagonist of this movie (Joaquin Phoenix) deserves an Oscar award. Great work done by director Todd Phillips. Storyline was good and quite disturbing. Rest of the crew did a decent role. The plot revolves around the life of joker which has led him to be the sinister of Gotham City. Watched the movie in imax and had a great experience. I will recommend others to watch the movie. Loved the movie a lot. Great work done by cast and crew of the movie.
5324,INSANE movie. Without a doubt the best origin film for the Joker that could've been made
5325,"In a time where we have 3 hour long movies full of CGI and fight scenes, there is one comic book movie that goes against the norm and tries to establish a new way of exploring the vast and complex repertory of characters this medium has to offer. Joker is a movie like no other, it is well shot, well acted and beautiful directed! This is the only movie that goes toe to toe with The Dark Knight as the greatest comic book ever made!!! Great job Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix, you have created a new cult classic!"
5326,"Perhaps one of the greatest films I've ever seen. Often The Joker is portrayed as a top class gangster/ring leader in the prime of his crime endeavours. However, I find this story visceral in its way of creating a monster whose only way is down, yet becomes a martyr against bureaucracy. Those who have the most ambition, but have no where to put it and no avenues to pursue, fall down a path of madness to achieve what they want. And this story told that madness perfectly. An outstanding film and one that will stay with me forever."
5327,"One of the best movies i've ever watched in my entire life, joaquin's performance was nothing but a masterpiece, it deserves all the HYPE!!"
5328,This movie sets the background for many upcoming blockbusters! Joaquin Phoenix was superb!
5329,What a brilliant performance! I've seriously never seen a better character study by an actor. Mind blowing.
5330,"Most incredible movie ever been made the direction the soundtracks joaquins acting everything was perfect, i have hadn't seen any mistake in that movie ."
5331,"I couldn't put my eyes away from this movie , the hole time my blood and veins were burning from excitement and thrilling"
5332,"When I saw the very first trailer for the Joker movie, I was disappointed. At first I thought it was going to be modeled after The Killing Joke, but that wasn't the case. I haven't been a great fan of Joaquin Phoenix before this movie, but I really feel he gave an Oscar worthy performance. He was the best part of the movie for me.I wasn't really a fan of the trailer for the movie, but going in with low expectations I was pleasantly surprised that the movie was better than expected. I really loved the tie-ins to Gotham City and Batman, but I am not sure if they were meant to add to the story or just to provide some storyline connected to Batman.Speaking of Batman, how could this Joker be the same one in the Batman storyline? At this rate, the Joker would be a feeble old man by the time Batman came into the picture. There also seemed to be a few messages being made here. Rich people are bad people. Poor people are hated by society. And society in general sucks.I felt that this movie could have been a character study for any person with a traumatic childhood experience, then having several more bad experiences throughout life that push one over the edge of sanity. I kept asking myself, Is this a movie about the Joker, or any one who has been shunned by society while burdened with family issues.When the movie was over, I sat in my seat trying to figure out if I liked the movie or didn't like it. To be honest, I am still undecided.I'm not sure why, but there were people with young children to see this movie. I must warn that it does earn its R rating so please consider whether you want to take your kids to see this film. It is very dark and violent at times.Overall, I would encourage people to see the movie. Joaquin's performance is so masterful, that it needs to be see onscreen.I am scoring an 8 for this film because the music was very dramatic and helped create the atmosphere when needed. Also for Joaquin's performance. I gave points for being artful and for entertainment value. But, was it a movie that I would say is ""Outstanding""? Sadly no."
5333,Incredible writer. Incredible actor. Best dc movie all of time
5334,"What a master piece, it so so wondeful, all in this movie is great: the construction of the movie, the ending, the performances, all is amazing
Just to be honest I wantt o go again and watch one more time
marvelous"
5335,It starts very slow and goes really fast and it goes crazy you see what happens
5336,This Is pure cinema. The acting is phenomenal the writing is great the visuals are stunning. My only critique is that I wanted more. Phoenix really gave this role his all... bravo
5337,I didn't believe the hyper but yeah this movie was 10/10
5338,"Simple the best film in a decade. Joaquim is amazing actor, the best of the best."
5339,"Wow! Great character development, the struggle is real. It all ties together so well. Excellent portrayal from JP. There is award in the future for sure"
5340,"I didn't think when I walked into that screening I would be experiencing one of the greatest movies of the 21st century so far. The performance by Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely mesmerizing to watch. The cinematography is beautiful and Todd Phillips's direction is great as well. This movie will be remembered for years and is on par with the greats like Fight Club and Pulp Fiction. It's definitely worth the watch. No movie is perfect, sure it has flaws, but they didn't bother me at all when watching, please don't miss this movie."
5341,"Having watched all of the Batman movies...ranging from Michael Keaton to Ben Affleck, the spin on Joker was intense, dark, and sad. Joaquin Phoenix does an amazing job sending the audience into a spiral of crazy. He makes you become empathetic of the Joker who has been stomped on by life and society.
Excellent movie however graphic violence in some parts."
5342,"This film is excellent, from the setting, the character development, the story and I have to say Phoenix was breath taking. Really moving to see life as the ""bad guy"" from his perspective.All in all an incredible performance all round!"
5343,"Now we know where he comes from and is not pretty
When Arthur hits the change walking/dancing the stairs you can feel it The joker is born
Is Joaquin movie is impressive"
5344,The first thing I did after leaving the theater was buying a ticket for the next show.
5345,"Where do I begin, the film follows Arthur Fleck, a man who is suffering from an uncontrollable mental affliction and occupies the lower echelons of society, through a series of events that lead him towards the path of becoming one of the most infamous villains in history: The Joker!!!!! All I have to say is this film is brilliant, disturbing, and of course tragic. Joaquin Phoenix brings an Oscar worthy performance throughout the whole movie as we follow his descent into madness. The soundtrack by Hildur Gudnadottir is a masterstroke, giving you this sense of sadness and horror as it plays throughout the film. Lawrence Sher's cinematography is absolutely stunning showcasing Arthur's world as ugly, fractured, yet strangely beautiful. And finally, the direction of Todd Phillips, along with his screenplay with Scott Silver, bring all of these elements together to portray a haunting tale of how a man with a fragile mindset can be turned into a monster by an unforgiving and corrupt society which won't be forgotten anytime soon."
5346,"I was skeptical prior to watching due to all the hype. But wow - Phoenix really owns the character, adding his own spin to Joker as we know him. The boundaries are pushed more and more which was a precedent set by Heath Ledger in Dark knight, adding a deeper facet to the Joker and coupled by the back story, cinematic precision and a really good story, JOKER is everything DC'ers have longed for since the Christopher Nolan Trilogy. Legacy links to Wayne's, Bruce and the death of Thomas created a real connection to all the stories we have watched before. I just hope the next Batman movie supersedes this - and a Batman & Joker movie is a MUST."
5347,"If you go watch Joker expecting the usual superhero tropes with good guys and villains (and maybe Batman?), you will be disappointed. But if you expect a really good story about human existence, Joker delivers and does it really well!Joker is the story about and unfortunate random person - one that in real life may even live in your same neighborhood - that had a difficult life and is completely abandoned by society, and his development into the villain we all know (or though we knew?). This movie reminds us that evil people are often not born evil: they are created by society and people that surround them.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is incredible and perfectly incarnates the Joker; he is the main reason that makes this movie as good as it is. The narration pace is sustained, with never a dull moment but without going too quickly either. The whole mix works really well, to the point of creating one of the best movies of the last years. Go watch it."
5348,"This guy deserves an Oscar, the movie is beautifully sad and the Close-ups on the faces show the immensity of the talent of the actor and director, it's a spectacular film, you forget the DC universe and superheroes, it's the time of the villains."
5349,"Joker: Gotham City is a grim place to live in, refuse collectors on strike, social services being cut back, widespread violent crime, a sharp divide between the rich and the poor. The Joker works as a clown at an agency where the clowns have to punch in on a time clock. He gets the worst gigs, beaten up by kids when he's advertising a closing down sale. Loses his psychiatrist and medication due to the cutbacks. He has to look after his crazed invalid mother who writes to billionaire Thomas Wayne begging for help as she worked for him decades ago. Then he loses his job. All of this pushes him to breaking point.We have a killer clown pursuing his prey along subway trains and platforms. Long corridors in hospitals, apartment buildings, steep sets of steps. A city on the brink of class war. When three of his employees are slain by the Joker Wayne decides to run for mayor, on a 1% platform, calling the poor clowns. He gets his answer as mobs riot while wearing clown masks. They see the Joker as a hero. Some scenes of savage violence as the Jokers break from reality continues and his new villain persona emerges. Great scenes of hordes of clowns travelling by subway trains to protests and riots. Very much an adult version of the Joker with an outstanding performance by Joaquin Phoenix in the title role. Robert De Niro plays Murray Franklin a talk show host originally adored by the Joker. We get to meet Alfred and the young Bruce Wayne but this is the Joker's story. Writer, director and producer Todd Phillips delivers a dark origin tale which likely puts himself and Phoenix in the running for Oscars. 9/10."
5350,Master peace and could be a beging for again batman vs joker duet
5351,Wow...blown away!! The actin in this is soooooo soooo goood....believe the hype and go c this sickkkkkkkk filmmmmmmm!!!
5352,"I was one of the few people who did not have much thought about the movie when I saw the first trailers. I did not expect it to be great or bad, I knew it was a Joker origin story, and that is about it. I had seen the Killing Joke animated movie and I immediately knew what I was getting into.
The movie was a perfect work of art that you can easily see fit in to the 1980s or with a few adjustments in the present or the Dark Knight trilogy as a spinoff.Joaquin Phoenix brings this character to life and you buy it so well because you understand what he experienced or why he goes down the dark path. He looks great as a either characters and you see the slow transformation.Finally the critics and the media are slamming this movie for being a celebration of evil. It's a lie and an intentional misdirection to get clicks on their videos or news sites. It is completely not. If this movie is a celebration of evil, then Deadpool is the month long celebration of violence and degradation because that movie kills people because it's fun and comedic. It is a disgrace how much the media and the critics bent backward to critic this movie just because it accurately portrays violent groups. So if you want to know why this movie is so drawn and quartered now in the US, it's because it sneaks in too much truth.So my recommendation is to go see it for yourselves. Games, movies and literature do not create monsters, people do."
5353,"Truly gripping from start to finish, filled with layers and depth, Joker is the best movie I've seen in a very long time. It's basically the Breaking Bad of movies."
5354,"Just got home and this movie gives you a bit of craziness and the chills ! I admitt I wasn't expecting a lot (no offense, but after the Jerard Leto fail you can't blame me) . So , omg what a performance! I got so deep into the movie that I didn't even touch my popcorn . It's the kind of movie that makes you appreciate Art , the Artist and the people behind the scenes. 10/10 from a humble Joker fan"
5355,"I went into this film knowing not to expect the supervillan we have seen portrayed many times over. This prepared me for the story, and more so, the messaged conveyed.Ultimately this piece of cinema tells
the audience of the harmful effect that comes from neglecting, bullying, and abusing. All while suggesting empathy and true friendship to all people regardless of mental health. The beauty of this film is that it produces conversation on how to be better and what we can do to be better, not just individually but collectively, as a society.Finally it would be remiss of me not to mention the work put into this film, namely Todd Philips and Joaquin Phoenix. From direction to the edit, every process expelled masterclass for the film. Reminding me of a Scorsese picture, this films production was astounding. Of all these operations, the soundtrack blew me away, making each moment feel exactly how the director wanted. Joaquin's performance was unnerving and dedicated, Todd's direction was twisted and beautiful.Joker is not a light-hearted film, there is depth and discomfort. A story to produce change and show the importance of empathy. A masterpiece in the art of cinematography."
5356,Such a good movie beginning to the end. Still has me thinking about it
5357,"Simply a perfect peice of art.
Simply a perfect peice of art.
Simply a perfect peice of art."
5358,"This film was an absolute masterpiece! From the acting, directing, score, etc everything was done so well done, however be warned that those last 45 minutes are intense. I highly recommend this movie!"
5359,"Its very intense, dark, and just fn crazy. Its very much its own animal...unlike anything you've ever seen in the Joker family."
5360,"Todd Phillips gave us the best version of our favorite villain that we related to.
The character build up was full of emotions of empathy and rage that will last with you after you leave the cinema hall!Joaquin Phoenix hit us hard with his phenomenal performance. He made us feel uncomfortable, miserable, angry and we showed empathy.
It was uneasy at all going through this all.And the master scene he gave us when he draw a smile on his face out of his blood was perfect👌.
I only wished to see more of the joker in the movie especially that Joaquin has the most similar features to the joker in the comic books and in our minds.Eventually this movie will leave you full of emotions of empathy and rage that will last with you after you leave the cinema hall!"
5361,"Not only is this a great comic book movie, it's a great movie, by all standards. One that would come in the 70s , looking like it, acting like it, by the biggest hits of it's cinematic output. This is not a pleasant movie to sit through. It depicts a persons slip from sanity in a way that makes you go from fearing for him to those who oppose him. Not in a way the celebrates these vile acts he commits. It knows the tragedy of the character, and uses it to create a genuinely impactful character study and form a cationary tale around it.Though it was questioned rather comedy director Todd Phillips would be able to bring the chops needed for such a story. Such worries are moot, once the brutal grittyness, the nastyness the visaeral execution of these things play out. It's well as well, moving in a slow burn to bursts, akin to the characters own mind, before it snaps at the end.Carrying this all is Phaqin Penoix, who is meanicing, unnerving, yet with a dose of fun and sympathy. He's creepy to watch and owns every scene, carrying the whole film as it's star. A film that is deserving of praise , makes you think, creates uncomfortable questions, and executes it's intentions valiantly. This one is a keeper every film buff should see."
5362,"KNOCK KNOCK! Joker is one such exceptional film which gets the perfect balance of staying noir & elevating empathy for the protagonist.
The film delves with oppression, the oppressed from the first frame, and it becomes very evident, the journey of the protagonist will take a downward curve in the graph to bring out the change in the society, unfortunately resulting in anarchy.
The film never tries to pretend intelligent, and it plays well within the dramatics, not getting drifted away. There are some real beautiful scenes which brings out how oppressed the protagonist is and that too with his signature laugh, you feel for the character, you want to hoot for him to succeed, and you realise the actions by the protagonist to resolve the main conflict is not justified, and the filmmaker is careful not to glorify his actions rather smartly diverts us into the psyche of the protagonist as defense mechanism.
Joaquin Phoenix gives us a crackling performance, enacting the Joker himself, every scene- the laugh, the stare, the helplessness has been so consistent, that one would expect him to succeed for his dream of becoming a standup comedian and come out of this pity. This is a perfect ode to Heath Ledger, he would have been so happy to see this amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix.
Lastly, the film beautifully portrays the real Joker on screen yet again, where his jokes are as subjective as his actions.
This film gives an urge to watch Heath Ledger's version of Joker.
Highly Recommended! Don't miss it!"
5363,"Joaquin Phoenix is playing the role of his life!
The dance, laugh and run are well executed. The weight loss he went through made him more credible for the role."
5364,"This movie is a rare gem. It's daring and fresh and a real thriller. I enjoyed it so much that i want to see more of joaquin phoenix' joker but i don't know if that would work. I recommend everyone to watch this, especially if you don't like the modern comic book movies. It's an entirely different experience from anything cb related movie we've seen so far."
5365,I can't even explain this you literally just need to go watch. I absolutely hated how he was treated in his marginalisation by society and at one point (subway scene) I was crying because my heart hurt for him. But it was the most powerful film I've ever seen and I have to keep reminding myself that it is not real and is only a film.
5366,Just watch it!! From start to finish gripping and intense. A roller-coaster of emotions throughout. The way joaquin portrays joker in this origin movie is spectacular. Character development is incredible and storyline is flawless. Not a movie... a work of art.
5367,"In my opinion, this is the best movie of the year and may become my favourite movie of all time given another viewing. But that's mostly because I love the Joker and have always loved the outcast characters. This movie just had a lot of things that I really liked, the ending, in my opinion, was perfect, allowing enough interpretation without undermining the story. It this movie flawless? No, of course not. But it is the best cinimatic joker origion I think were going to get."
5368,"Joaquin is one of the best acting performers I've ever seen
And Thank you tod for this amazing movie"
5369,"As soon as the film begins, we aren't confronted with someone whose personality will make their journey to becoming The Joker a predictable one. The movie's director has wisely gone with the idea of having the audience experience every stage of Arthur Fleck's descent into insanity. Joaquin Phoenix's performance ably shows that outward circumstances created Batman's number one foe. He then becomes a more sympathetic character, even though he is gradually morphing into a monster. The shooting of the three bankers comes at a pint when all the bad things that have happened to Fleck psychologically overwhelm him.
From then on, all the people who have heaped misery onto his state of mind become the vat of chemicals that physically turned him into Joker. Near the end of the movie, Todd Phillips cleverly has Fleck's final murderous act becomes the catalyst for Bruce Wayne's parents to be murdered. Though it's a standalone film, this ending sets things up for the reboot of the Batman film franchise, in spite of that not being Phillips' intention. This movie deserves more than one Academy Award nomination and it deserves more than one Oscar win."
5370,"I wouldn't believe that someone after Heath Ledger would be able to perform such magical performance for the Joker. I must say Joaquin, your desire to be such person is something that we can't put it in our sentence. Thank you for this incredible show."
5371,"This movie was so colourful but dark at the same time. It looks absolutely beautiful. I believe DC has been trying to make their movies gritty, serious and dark. But it never worked with the way they attempted in the past few years. It was very diffrent from what DC has been trying for years, you know... they make the colours, the athmosphere all gross and stuff, the story is always the same with the big bad unstoppable godly villain.This was such a diffrent experience. Entertaining and effective. It had a really interesting and kinda confusing story too. It was hard to watch at times and some scenes actually made me uncomfortable. How they managed to write Joker is astounding. The isolation and the struggles he faces are told is exciting.This is the best movie I saw this year. It deserves the hype. I love this movie, it surprised me. I am proud of DC. I hope they write movies as good as this. Maybe even better ones, if possible. This might be the start of a new era for superhero movies. At least I hope it is."
5372,The movie was extremely good to go inside of the joker's life with his perspective. And there is no moment you lose your focus from screen. And Joaquin Phoneix definitely deserves Oscar with his performance. You should watch this movie at cinema. Joker was one of the best origin movie I have ever seen with no doubt!
5373,Joaquin Phoenix delievers an even better performance than Heath Ledger. The cinematography is our if this world and the best scene is the talkshow scene.
5374,"A failed stand-up comedian Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) takes on the establishment and analyses his life, as events unfold on the fine line between tragedy/comedy.Isolated by his society, it's unfortunate that unlike in Her, the tech is not available for Phoenix to have the sweet beautiful sensual voice of ScarJo to keep him from loneliness, instead only his sick mother!This leaves Fleck stumbling for a connection, slowly descending into madness, leading him to what all depressives do, try stand-up comedy! He gets poor reviews, however he definitely has better delivery and material than say Russel Howard. Ultimately he aspires to get a spot on Late Night, hosted by De Nero in a return to form Jay Leno/David Letterman role.This is a hyper real take on the Joker, where the backdrop is Gotham, but it could be anywhere - following a serial murderer. The links to the DC world are almost the weakest parts and just necessary. If Phoenix was portraying a real person, then he wins an Oscar for this performance."
5375,"I don't understand the negative reviews and Metacritic score. I think these critics need to come down from their pathetic self-centered high grounds and see the movie for what it is: an outstanding piece of art the likes of which are produced very rarely. This coming from a person who has seen thousands of movies from across timelines and across cultures. It should get at least 5 Oscar noms and win at least three. If Joaquin Phoenix does not get Best Actor Oscar then the Academy deserves a visit by Arthur Fleck!. Definitely among the 10 best ever from any country and any language. And btw, the theatre was packed, the movie commanded hushed silence and audience gave a rousing applause at the end, something I had never seen in my country, ever."
5376,"This movie is truly exellent!
🙌🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I hope so this year Joaquin will recive Oscar !"
5377,"Joker is a top tier film with great pacing, just the right amount of action, great cinematography, an unforgettable score and perfect acting by Joaquin Phoenix. A must see for any comic book fan and even if you don't enjoy comic book or superhero/villain verse movies, Joker manages to be a movie for everyone who enjoys great film, except ur kids of course ;). One of my new favourite movies personally and I would recommend it to anyone as long as your aren't bothered by the gratuitous violence and disturbing themes."
5378,"Its been 2 days since i saw this movie, and im still processing it in my head.
It has so many layers, yet on the surface its still great entertainment.
Do you sympathise with Arthur, or do you get mad at him for doing the things he did? Well i still dont know what I do, but the ride was epic. A masterpiece!I really hope that the DC folks will see now, that the future for their franchise is Character-driven plots, and stop with the silly generic CGI antagonists! (Does anyone remember the name of the bad guy in either Wonder woman or justice league? Didnt think so)Beside a decent Wonder Woman movie, this is only the 4th truly great DC movie (along the 3 Nolan batmans) - I hope they can get Phillips onboard to do one or two more movies for this is apparently right up his alley.DC listen up: This is how you do it from now on!"
5379,Arguably the top match for the heath ledger performance = Joaquin phoenix. Joaquin Phoenix nailed it.
5380,"Yesterday, I went to watch the Joker, and I have to say that the film was absolutely brilliant. It has genuinely put a positive smile on my face! Joaquin Phoenix's performance, the overall storyline, along with how the film was put together is completely worth watching.As the Joker is a standalone film from the current list of DC films, it was refreshing to see a bold, dark and gritty attempt to deeply witness Arthur transform into one of the world's most notorious comic book villain. I would like to go in depth about his transition, but it is something the viewers need to watch for themselves. For me, this is one of the reasons why I enjoyed this film - it is not just about the Joker being a psychopath, but it is about understanding Arthur's circumstances, as well as his perspective about life.In terms of Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of the Joker, I really enjoyed his take on the character, and his version is currently my favourite. The insanity and brutal stance (attitude) of Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is just mind-blowing, and this film gives us an opportunity to see an untamed and extreme Joker in a live action film.This film does contain some shocking, violent, along with gruesome scenes, and this is to be expected with a character like the Joker. He is not the clown you invite to your child's birthday party for an amusing experience. Looking back at the film, certain scenes were not even that horrific, and critics and individuals are unnecessarily attacking this film. There are other films and TV shows that are much more aggressive than the Joker.If you are yet to watch the film, go and see it without overthinking it. The hype that was within the trailers, expands throughout the film. It is that good. The Joker is a one of a kind film, and Todd Phillips has shown us what is possible for mature, in depth and dark comic book films."
5381,The movie of the year and beyond!Must see.Looking forward to the next Joker movie.
5382,"Masterpace ,great.best movie in last 4 or 5 years.i wich phonix win oscar gor he great proforms"
5383,"Joaquin Phoenix's performance. Cinematography. Acting. Directing. Music. Tone. Pace. Suspense. Everything about this film is BEAUTIFUL. I don't care if this inspires world violence or not, it is a masterpiece. This Is art. This is going to be one of my all time favourite psychological thriller movies. I don't believe the controversy. It won't inspire mass murder or terrorists. It is fiction. It is a realistic drama and character study about what creates an unstable man. I'm not a super fan of the Joker, but I must say, DC better keep doing movies like this."
5384,"Wonderful and bleak and a dissent into madness and it leaves you unsettled, which is exactly what you want and should expect from a killer clown"
5385,"In summary this film was enjoyable and felt like something I haven't seen that frequent coming out of Hollywood.It's effectively a character building thriller that takes you on an emotional exploration of the most famous Villian in DC history. The tone of the film is very slow and dark, it takes time to draw you into Arthur's life so that you can 'relate' to him and understand why he makes the decisions or acts in the way he does. This happens for the first hour of the movie before the pace quickens and the audience get what they came for - a dark DC character losing his mind and inflicting pain on anyone who disagrees with him.Joaquin is very good in it and the holes in the story line that are encountered throughout you almost forgive because of his fantastic performance.The only major criticisms for me was the involvement of the Wayne family felt forced. I don't think a single person in the cinema thought he was Bruce's brother so it didn't need to be his motive for finally pushing over the edge and going insane. Him being lied to by his mother following being treated badly by everyone would of been a fine way to progress the character to breaking point.It also had a massive political agenda behind the rise of the Joker which felt flat. Gotham always had problems, Arthur Fleck shouldn't of been an influence at that level - it should of been as he became the crime lord that he gained support and appreciation from others.Please don't let Robert Pattinson anywhere near this movie.8/10 for me and will watch again when released from cinema."
5386,"Ignore comic book fans hating the story change, everyone calling this a masterpiece is right."
5387,"Joker was beautifully depressing like a Street Car Named Desire. It was by no means a Super hero film which I loved about it. Rather than formulaic dog shit, it actually did something different, dirty, grimy and succeeded in being hopelessly dark, captivating and Phoenix was brilliant. This is definitely the darkest Joker you will ever see and reminds me of Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, The Tenant and Requiem for a Dream mixed with a Scorcesse/Tarantino Pizazz."
5388,"People are walking out because this movie hits home. As realistic as it can get! Everyone did an amazing job getting this film done. Even though DC fans may know what's coming next, it will still cause sweet beautiful shock, the kind you have not experienced in years.Leave your brats at home."
5389,"The movie starts and so the suffering of Arthur Fleck, he tries to be good with people but everytime he is punished for that, even the condition he has who makes him laugh spontaneously makes it worst.The movie makes you empathize with the character because the world is so mean to him and make you think if not the society create these monsters.At the final theres a great twist and a super satisfying ending."
5390,As a viewer and a fan of Joker this was a amazing movie. Joaquin carries this movie. What a performance from him. Simply outstanding. I thought no one could pull off a Joker after Heath Ledger in Dark Knight but I am happy to be proven wrong. This is a must watch. Joaquin deserves an Oscar for his performance. And please ignore the stupid controversy created by pathetic media.
5391,"I think that this movie was created for a mature public, and as a mature person I loved it"
5392,"Very strong build up character with great storytelling. I enjoyed every moment in the movie, from the begining until the end without forgetten the class performance by Joaquin Phoenix.It would be unfair to say Heath performed better neither Phoenix, both portrayals were great.I will sum my review with one word ""Iconic"""
5393,"From the beginning to the end of this movie, it was so well explained how he became who is now, the joker! There were parts that had me and my daughter surprised, like the Bruce Wayne part and his mother. I didn't expect the movie to be the way that it was, and I'm so glad we went to go see it. It was such a good movie and it kind of reminded me of the actor who played the joker in Dark Knight."
5394,"Joker is a masterful look into the mind of a psychopath. The tension was palpable in the theatre, people cowered and screamed at every display of the Joker's unparalleled insanity. Joker is a compelling look into treading the line between psychotic and normal, chaotic and peaceful, evil or disturbed. Joaquin Phoenix was truly better than perfection in this role."
5395,"I'm no longer a huge fan of many super hero movies. And it seems like DC has not really been able to find a formula like Marvel has in order to produce good ones. They often picked gritty movies for the wrong superhero. However, this movie is one of the greatest super hero movies of all time."
5396,"This movie is spectacular. But there are some things you have to understand before you go and blast it - this is not a movie about the Joker. It's about a man BECOMING the Joker. Because of this, the ""Joker"" we picture when we think of the character doesn't appear until the last 20-30 minutes of the film. The majority of it is a slow build chronicling a mentally ill man's descent into madness. This descent is a new origin story that takes more from The Killing Joke than it does classic Joker origin stories - and some people don't seem to understand that in comics, a character can be invented and reinvented and reinvented again. That's how we get characters like Miles Morales as Spider-Man. No origin is set in stone. For instance, The Dark Knight's Joker (I stand by The Dark Knight as one of the best movies of all time) has no origin that we know of. We have two unlikely stories he tells us. Batman (1989) calls the Joker ""Jack Napier"". So Joker (2019) doesn't follow a comic, it invents its own character. And it does so more in the style of Taxi Driver than a typical comic. It's really not a comic movie - it's a character study. And considered in that context, we have a purely excellent movie.
Phoenix is superb. Period. The music is epic. The cinematography is stunning. It's not ""overly violent"", it's not ""too bleak"". The Joker is historically a violent character, first of all. Second of all, some of the best movies of all time are ""bleak"". Yes, it's gritty and it's kind of realistic but not really, and that's what you have to accept. The first hour and a half is good, great even, though somewhat slow - your attention is kept by Phoenix's excellent performance and some truly phenomenal scenes. But the last half hour is where it shines, creating one of the best final acts I have ever seen in a film. And no, it doesn't spark incel rage and if you can't tell the difference between film and reality, don't watch films."
5397,"This film was a masterpiece. Especially the laugh of Joker. This time he will get the oscar, it's 100%."
5398,"This Joker was a masterpiece. The way Todd Phillips unfolds the tragic story of Arthur Fleck is a piece of cinema that can only be explained by emotion. The essence in which the Joker as a character is warped and distorted to be the award winning, no doubt, performance of Joaquin Pheonix is truly exceptional and outstanding. From the mis en scene to the minor green tint throughout the whole movie, each frame is to be cherished by the audience. Todd Philips should be internationally recognised and applauded for his story telling in Joker. If you emphasise for a villain who has caused a whole city to riot and to murder, either you are sick, or Philips' creation has been successful. Heath ledger isn't comparable to how amazing and twisted this performance was. If I was to recommend any movie, it'd be 2019s shock film Joker. Physiologically thrilling and heart throbbingly emotional at the same time, this movie has made 5 stars in my opinion. Congratulations Warner Brothers."
5399,The Joker was beautifully brilliant! Amazing cinematography. Exceptional storytelling. Impeccable acting. The action of this film was unexpected. For once I could not anticipate the next move. It's sheer genius and creativity. In a world where we are moving at such a vivacious pace it took me down a slow journey into the darkness trauma can bring. And it was a sweet twist on the the Batman origin story! If you love the artistry of filmmaking than it is a must see.
5400,"Never in a million years would I have expected Todd Phillips to make a movie of this caliber. It falls into what I'd like to believe is a sub genre of comic book films, like Logan and Brightburn, where the world of superheros is more dark and intense than the action/comedy cookie cutter big budget films (don't get me wrong, I love them also) we get during the summer season. Joker is incredible."
5401,An absolute masterpiece and wonderful performance from joaquin. The joker is created for him.the music was awesome i enjoyed the whole time .
5402,A true piece of art. I had the privilege to watch this movie today. I can't imagine anyone else playing the role of Joker. We all have seen Heath Ledger's performance in The Dark Knight. I thought Heath Ledger's performance was twisted. Joaquin Phoenix performance is even more twisted. If he doesn't get an Oscar then I'll stop watching movies. He has put his heart and soul in this performance. Don't believe critics words. This movie has to be watched in a movie hall. At the end I was actually in tears. It would be sad if someone else is given Oscar instead of Joaquin Phoenix. This has to be the best origin story ever told. I don't have words to describe this movie. Still reeling under the effect of this movie. Request all to watch this movie. This is Joaquin Phoenix's best word till date.
5403,"This movie is masterpiece. The acting, the music, the environment everything is masterpiece. I got out of theatre, went home slept a bit and even after 12 hours,my head still remembers the vivid details of the movie. It leaves a lasting impact. Though the movie is great. I gotta say. This movie is a single shot, it wouldnt be continued to dc universe. Lastly if you have not watched this movie you are missing a piece of art that would be remembered for ages"
5404,"Joker is a masterpiece, Joaquin phoenix acting is excellent,on par with heath ledger performance also robert de niro was so good in this movie.
It is not like any comic book movie you have ever seen, first and foremost it is R rated,It is a dark origin story of one of the most twisted characters in comic book history,It is heavly influenced by Scorsese films like taxi driver,The Score the cinematography,This movie is beautiful,you can pause the movie any second and there will a great frame you could hang on your wall,my only complaing in this movie is that the pacing somehow is odd,there is scenes where it hypes you but then slow down,which I understand because the movie grounded itself in a realastic story,so don't expect joker walking around and killing people from the first minute.
Totally Recommend"
5405,"This film was incredible I love the tie ins to taxi driver,king of comedy and the killing joke. Joker has been surrounded by controversy some saying about its violence and it being sinister it that is a load of crap and it should not make you reconsider seeing the film. Joaquin Phoenix knocks it of the park with his performance possibly Oscar worthy. If you are expecting a classic superhero film it's not what you will expect this film gets you thinking it's very psychological. This film was so good in some ways I do wish it was an 18 but the joker is an incredible film it's proud of what it is and it is the best superhero film of the year"
5406,"The critics are so very wrong. This film is stunning from start to finish. Everything is on point, the style, cinematograghy, acting, music score are all phenomenal. I really enjoyed viewing the film from the perspective of Arthur, his journey was our journey. His unreliable narration was really engaging and I felt constantly on edge.Perhaps this film glorifies violence in the way that every action film does. This is a film about the Joker, there's going to be violence and depictions of mental health, which in my opinion were grounded in realism. I don't see people complaining about John Wick, The bourne identity, James Bond, the godfather, pulp fiction, goodfellas, American Psycho, kill bill, django unchained etc etc. I get the point but I dont see how its any different in this movie than the rest."
5407,"There is a surprisingly high number of critics calling this movie empty and meaningless. I believe they are having a difficult time differentiating between the film being void of substance and their own feelings of emptiness. Joker indeed left a pit in my stomach. The kind you get when you witness something traumatizing. And this film is traumatic in the best way.The intricate camera work is almost too close for comfort. But man, is this a beautiful looking movie. The colors are rich... the reds of the streetlights, the blue haze of the city.... creates an atmosphere that puts the viewer right into this world. The wide shots of Gotham are absolutely stunning, even as it's showing us the dirty, grimy nastiness of it.The story Todd and the filmmakers came up with works pretty well. They borrow bits and pieces of material from the comics, but they created new beats for the story that helps it stand on its own. Not to spoil anything, but the way they introduce the lore of our characters heroic counterpart is quite affective. At first I thought it was far reaching, but by the end it comes together and makes for quite an engaging story. As for the motivations of the Joker, there is a complicated tight rope to balance. But it is understandable here. We can understand Arthur is spiraling and we can sympathize with his internal (and external) struggle. But the film is not asking you to root for or forgive him for his actions. We know he's a villain.The violence... it's there. But not in quantity. Most other superhero films or action films have more fighting, violence, and more of
A body count. HOWEVER, the violence is brutal and visceral. This is what I believe is bothering people. As it should. It depicts violence in a horrifying realistic way.So Joaquin Phoenix... I don't know what to really say here. He is an artist. A mad one. I respect this actor so much, and I am in complete awe of him. This man sold this. I believed it. Everything from the physical to the internal. His movements were slightly unnatural, inhuman. Behind his eyes was a pain that we recognize is there, but there is no way we can fathom the gravity behind it. his moments of emotional outbursts are so sporadic and unpredictable.... and he isn't TRYING to have them.... I could tell he was surpassed that and was trying to hold it back. That is completely amazing to me. He isnt acting he is showing us this character, like a piece of art. No one, NO ONE can deny that this performance is extraordinary. It's one that will be remembered in the future as one of the best in history. It transcends a normal performance. It's visceral, it's terrifying, it's an experience to watch. Joaquin Phoenix is an actor in the true sense. He is, in my opinion, one of the best... in history.This is a difficult film, it's not lighthearted at all. It's a shame if you miss this though, as it's a work of art. I would recommend it as a great film, but be cautious of the blunt nasty darkness of it. It is truly a horrific masterpiece."
5408,"I was concerned about the hype and rarely put a review on IMDB. But this time I was just astonished by the performance of the Joker. You can feel the stress, anxiety madness, sadness, basically all the emotions played by an actor at the best level. Even his body seems having pain and sadness for the entire movie. Disturbing and amazing at the same time. Just a Masterpiece."
5409,"I never write reviews about movies, even though I have seen movies where my mind is blown but Joker... it's not just an origin story but a cinematic masterpiece where the storyline, costume design, sound and even the colors were very well executed. Joaquin's acting is definitely Oscar worthy, his performance is what will get him out of the ""underrated"" category. He portrays the essence of Joker and to see how the character came to be was simply marvelous and surprisingly satisfying. Would watch it more than once and I'm not one of those people. 100% recommended."
5410,"So far, the best film I have seen DC has made. So much has been conveyed, within such a little time. Getting a storyline has always been hard for DC, the mixed timelines and the inconsistent story and bouncing between characters has always been a downer. The one character that has always made DC a success was Joker. And this film has lived up to it's name.
The screenplay is one of the best in the recent times. Joaquin phoenix has lived as the Joker entirely. The transformation of Arthur Flex to The Joker, the penultimate movie of the entire DC cinematic universe. It's a must watch for everyone who wishes to side with the Joker.
I would give everything I have up in a heart beat just to see another movie Joker movie made."
5411,"This movie is bold, tragic, chaotic, shocking and a punch in the gut. Those getting bothered by this certainly did not liked the portrayal of our society, simply because it's too real. Go watch it."
5412,"Heath Ledger will probably always be my favorite rendition of The Joker, because of the charisma and intelligence he brought to the role.
With that said, I don't think anyone could have played this version of the Joker except for Joaquin Phoenix. He did things with the character, both through physicality of acting and through emotional depths, that both amazed and hurt me.
The movie is most definitely a drama and something of a personal journey of horror. It does not, as was my fear and the voiced concerns of many others, demonize everyone with a mental illness, or give justification for the incels and Red Pill Society members and MRA's to be terrible human beings. Neither does it say ""Hey if you're alone and nobody likes you you can fix your problems with a little random violence."" Instead, it shows us a plethora of factors, and a variety of nudges, that cause someone who's already struggling with who they are in life, and whether or not they actually even exist, to take a dark path. Joker shows us that those with mental illnesses, the 'clowns', the people considered broken or invisible or worthless by society as a whole, are being consistently let down by the system, at every turn. And Phoenix, and the writers, do an incredible job of showing us that The Joker is *human*. He's not some criminal mastermind, not at this point; he's very much figuring things out as he goes, and the film takes care to point out several times that the Joker is not making a political statement with his actions; he's not trying to enact sweeping change, or smash the Patriarchy, or fight The Man; he's just done with everyone's shit, and with how he feels the world is treating him. The movie doesn't have a lot of violence, but when it does it is brutal, harsh and quick; and it explores the ripple effects those violent acts cause.I found this to be an incredible film. I didn't come away from it feeling like it blamed those with mental issues or trauma; The Joker was very much responsible for his own actions, just as we all are. But it definitely helped remind me that underneath the makeup, there was still a human being in there, and it definitely made me analyze my feelings on the interactions between Batman and the Joker over the years.If you see this movie, expect to cry (I teared up several times) and to feel awkward; they do an excellent job of overextending an awkward situation until it becomes almost unbearable. Also, they somehow manage to be predictable without being boring; the predictability instead turns into a slow build of dread, because you can see where something is going a mile off, and then you're still along for the unavoidable end. And this movie is an R for a lot of language, and some fairly brutal violence.
It is not a movie that leaves you feeling good at the end, but it is one I am glad I went to see, and I hope that they tap Phoenix for the Joker in a future movie; he can clearly find that character's depths."
5413,"All that i can say is
Wow how amazing trully really i wonder joker will be trully movie of all time in my personal opinion,
U dont need hire all star to create amazing film,
Look at this movie and gonna blow ur mindJOKER"
5414,"After Jared Leto's letdown performance as the character in 2016's Suicide Squad, Joaquin Phoenix delivers the best performance of The Joker since the late Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight!This film is a self contained story that doesn't draw heavily off of any one comic book story, though there are little nods to the comics, such as The Wayne Family/a young Bruce Wayne playing a prominent role in the movie, plus subtle nods to The Killing Joke and The Dark Knight Returns.It's in a dark, gritty world that the film takes place, as we are taken back to 1981 and we're transported to a Gotham City unlike any we've seen before on film, a city not unlike our real world. It's a Gotham City on the edge of chaos, and Phoenix's Arthur Fleck/Joker is the catalyst that throws the switch, as the people of Gotham begin to riot against the elite and upper class of the city and regard The Joker as a folk hero and Robin Hood type of figure. The film has major echoes of past 80s films, such as Taxi Driver and Dog Day Afternoon.It's within this gritty realism that the stakes of the movie takes place. Phoenix's portrayal of this mentally unstable man, whom society has turned it's back on, is both frightening and relatable. As his mental faculties begin to unravel, the viewer can't help but sympathize in some way with The Joker's plight. He's pained by what he's suffered in life, but he goes off the deep end into a life of crime. That's what makes Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of the character so frightening. More than any other incarnation of the character, this one has echoes of our real world: that nothing is more frightening than a mentally unstable person with a gun.But it also leaves The Joker's backstory up in the air and up for debate by the end of the film, as Arthur/Joker is an unreliable narrator, and the audience is left wondering what exactly in the film's narrative was the truth and what were just delusions in The Joker's head.It's a film that transcends genres. It's not just a great comic book based film, it's a gritty, dark, and brilliantly done character study. It's a movie with real world consequences, as the characters are very reflective of the criminals that plague the news every day.An absolutely stunning performance by Joaquin Phoenix, and the movie definitely is worth every amount of acclaim it's getting! Phoenix deserves an Oscar! It's a brilliant piece of film!!"
5415,"From the moment the movie started, it was dark and it got darker which each segment. Over the years we have gotten full fledged jokers never an origin where we actually get to see why he became joker. I'm really glad mr phillips took up the mantle in doing this film because we really needed a change from the campy, over the top, predictable, cheesy and kid friendly cbm's we've been getting esp. from marvel. You do have people out there who are interested in serious contents that challenges one's belief. This movie isn't glorifying killing or incels it shows you how society can help shape disenfranchise individuals. The fact that critics are outraged over this, has led me to be believe the director has achieved his motive(by creating a thought provoking film). The critics are proving todd's and joker's point about society. This is top tier movie and DEFINITELY one of the best movies ever made esp. in the 21st century. The best movie of the year.....It's right up there with Dark Knight if not better."
5416,Just watch the movie and enjoy the music and the acting 😍
5417,"A very deep psychological dig into the society's most destructive tool which is the society itself. Gotham, the perfect atmosphere to transform a citizen into the Joker. The movie is about this journey of transformation psychologically and socially. It also digs into the heart and soul of the idea of anarchy.
Epic performance from Joaquin Phoenix, an Oscars worthy.
Mesmerising cinematography.
Outstanding music and soundtracks thanks to Todd Phillips who was extremely successful in every piece he put together to create this masterpiece.I loved every single shot."
5418,That is an amazing psychoanalytic film. Go inside and feel the conscious
5419,With out words. I didn't spect something like this. Just increible. Just amazing.
5420,I real adult level Joker movie. If only the rest of the DC universe movies followed this context.
5421,Never seen such acting incredible performance from joaquin. Phoenix incredible movie
5422,"Pheonix's Joker is forces you to watch it again and again and it's perfect psychological study of neurological condition that Joker suffer from.
I'm Doctor and i have a lot of experience with this cases, and couldn't differentiate it was real or just acting and that actually fair to say that the Oscar goes to pheonix.
Bravo pheonix 👏 🃏🃏"
5423,👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Joaquin Oscar and the film Amazing. A long time ago I did not see the film so magnificently. Thank you Joaquin for the legendary performance.
5424,"The movie has a very dark atmosphere, which is somewhat iconic for the DC Universe. It started a bit slow, but there is no lack of action or twists in the movie and as I mentioned in the title - the ending was simply epic. I like the way Joker is portrait as some sort of a dark Messiah. 1 goof though I noticed - When he shoots those 3 douches in the metro, there were a few extra shots fired from a six shot revolver. Definitely not a movie for every one. A strange mix of extreme violence, dark humor and touching moments which kinda make you sympathise the charter.
All actors preformed perfect!"
5425,"Amidst all the propaganda this film is facing from the media this is without a doubt one of the best character driven film ever done. Everything in this film ooze great film making. Cinematography is drop dead gorgeous, sound track is hauntingly beautiful, directing wise Todd Philips has outdone himself, characters are extremely realistic, Gotham has never been this well shot and made and of course the acting. Holy hell it was good. Now before I get into the the obvious choice, I just want to bring Robert Di Niro who I thought was absolutely amazing in his role with such a little time given. With that said it is Joaquin Phoenix is what makes this film. I have seen most of his film from The master to the gladiator. And with this film he has cemented as one of the best actor to grace the screen. He is absolutely hypnotic in the role that you began to cheer for him. At the end when the credits role this film will make you think for better or for worst. And I think that is what film should do. That's the power of art."
5426,"This is my first review on IMDb, but I am happy that this is the film that sent me here. The movie is genuine, cruel, raw, and absolutely brilliant.
Even though this is a fictional character, the movie presents a reality that many people ignore by choice.
Great job!!!"
5427,"Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?
All I have are negative thoughts.
Everybody is awful nowadays.
It is enough to make anyone crazy.
Everybody yells and screams to each other.
Nobody is civil anymore.
Nobody thinks what it's like to be the other guy.

5429,"This movie resonated with me on a whole new level. We live in a society where gamers are expected to endure under the authoritarian subjugation of our society. Where SJWs consider gaming a mental illness and try to repress our battle cries. GAMERS, RISE UP. Veronica... you could've been my queen. You were fearless, crazier than me, you could've been my queen and god help anyone who'd disrespect my queen. I could've shared this revolution with you... but you friend zoned me 10 times... 10 TIMES VERONICA WHEN WILL YOU LEARN TO LOVE ME, A GENTLEMAN GAMER, INSTEAD OF GOING AFTER DUMB JOCKS!!! GAMERS, RISE UP! RISE UP! WE WILL TAKE BACK WHAT IS OUR'S!!!"
5430,Oscar movie and acting .... Congrats for everyone who delivered this masterpiece to us ... Joaquim best actor or nothing
5431,"Director, actor Joaquin Phoenix and music are amazing 😍😍😍😍😍"
5432,"This movie is different. Different from average comic movies, adventures, dramas or thrillers.
It's not only a new perspective to the Joker, the world of Batman or DLC.
It's a music poet to in psychiatric illness, in sick society, in evil, in darkness of human soul.
A new way to make drama oe thriller movies.
A deep epic movie that leaves you with a scary laugh at the end, just like joker's.
joaquin phoenix is the actor of the year and with Robert De Niro & Tod Philips give us one of the best movies in history of cinema & pop culture."
5433,"#Joker is an intense character study movie, not your typical comic book story movie at all (and hence, not for everyone and certainly not for teenagers). It's a deep, crude dive into a man's descent into madness and a lucid depiction of a sick mind. It's filled with gritty raw human emotion with no sublimation. It leaves you with a tormenting bitterness that might stay for a while!It draws widely from the source material in terms of small arcs, character details and lines, though the latter is a bit generalized. References to ""The Killing Joke"" are alluringly evident here and there. There is a handful of great lines that shine in the context of the portrayed suffering. It's violent, dark and will keep you at the edge of your seat with all its painstalkingly disturbing unfoldings, but do not jump on the propaganda bandwagon on this. It's dark!! That's true, but certainly not darker than the source material.Cinematography and camera angles are a work of beauty. Music shares in the buildup of a certain aura. Screenplay and plot are orchestrated to serve the general scheme. Todd Philips's narrative unfolds after elaborate buildup. He follows in the steps of Scorsese an borrows his glasses sometimes to shine the spotlight on his creation/theories. He tries to sell outrage, societal oppression and politics and their cumulative effect on the chaos that ensues. Joaquin Phoenix is totally brilliant. He gracefully jumps from a state to another and drags you into opposing points on the spectrum of emotion in an effortless-seemingly act. There have been calls claiming his act is Oscar-worthy!Joker, as a character, is an oversimplification of an idea that fights to takeover as much as it can of our psychology. He's never the answer but often the question that nobody asks. An unstoppable force premise, flawed but existential.Joker, the movie, is a masterpiece in every aspect that's definitely not for everyone! It points out to a problem and a problematic solution in a world of widely-gapped societies and self-centered ideoligies that overcompensate with interest-driven orientation, vindictive projection and malice. It's an incarnation of the chaos that uproars inside us and the most vile and horrid outcomes that can unravel out of it.. with a bloody smile!!#TheJokerMovie 🤡
#PutOnAHappyFace! 🙂
#AllItTakesIsOneBadDay!!"
5434,"This is definitely not your average comic book movie. With barely any action of Arthur as The joker, it's much more of a developmental story. A man struggling with serious mental illness. It's sad, in a good way! Sad to see a man go from relatively innocent, just wanting to make happiness, to someone who has an act for killing. Overall amazing film!"
5435,I love this movie so much and this is the movie for me. I can't wait to see it again with my friends and we can't stop talking about this movie after we saw it a few days ago. Love it. Thumbs up.
5436,"I was not surprise , when the critics reviewed this movie poorly. Because its criticism which creates the 'jokers' in society.This movie make the critics butt-hurt. I wish I could rate it 100/10. Phoenix is a good actor.. But its his Best performance after Ring of fire"
5437,"Joker is the best cinema i have ever seen, especially in this genre which can very easily turn overly arty, slow and boring. But not Joker.Every frame is stunning, start to end. The Writing, Cinematography, Bgm, Direction and the Acting are all at the Highest level in every department.Mr Joaquin Phoenix🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 left me scared, in awe and unable to move from my seat for sometime at the end of the show.How can this be topped, i dont know.A very special mention for 1 of the greatest actors of all time Mr Robert De Niro 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Pitch Perfect !"
5438,"I honestly enjoyed this movie and this is the 1st movie from DC that I have liked and a while. Joaquin Phoenix did a phenomenal job along with everybody else that made this movie happen. It truly gave an in depth look at what created and led up to the joker that we see to day, I believe that it was a good origins movie.I will say that it did start off a little slow but that was the perfect setting, the timing and events of the movie were well done. Phoenix definitely put on a legendary performance.Despite what some of the movie critics are saying the warnings from police and FBI. This movie is completely worth watching and you should not let the mentally weak people dictate what you go and enjoy. This really gives a good insight to the world of the mentally ill and how it can go wrong.I would give this movie a 9 out of 10 and I look forward To seeing this particular brand of joker expand into another movie."
5439,Fantástico!!! Gran actuación de Joaquín Phoenix. Futuro ganador de Óscar
5440,"Amidst all the propaganda this film is facing from the media this is without a doubt one of the best character driven film ever done. Everything in this film ooze great film making.

5441,"Humanity is not known to be empathetic towards those who are percieved weak. Here, we have a Joker, who's weak.. stunningly so. Joaquin has conveyed just how terribly weak he is, in the most convincing manner. His hair, his gait, his mannerisms, his tics, his speech. And the reason why most would find this movie an uncomfortable watch is mainly because the movie really doesn't give any excuses. It basically puts up a mirror to how society can and often does behave.The class divide, the class envy, the apathy towards sorrow (however big or small), the absolute indignity of life and living- none of it has been exaggerated. That does make the movie a little hard to palate. But precisely why it should be watched.The movie was beautifully shot, the background score was absolutely fantastic. Those are the technical aspects that have to be appreciated.. acting wise, it was a stellar cast and everyone did justice but of course Joaquin completely outshines everyone by the way he's committed himself to this role.Go watch this movie, but fair warning it's not meant to be a super villain origin story and therefore doesn't have any of the gimmicks associated with these comic inspired movies. You are basically watching a mentally ill man who's unravelling and reveling in the chaos that ensues."
5442,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I admit I was very concerned that Joaquin Phoenix would be reinterpreting Heath Ledger's defining performance. Or worse yet, imitating. Now having seen it, I can say that my concern was fake news. Phoenix provides a fragile, entirely empathetic while horrific character study that dovetails perfectly with Heath Ledger's performance. It isn't a shadow, but you can see pieces fall into place that set Joker's trajectory and that of Gotham itself as well. I recommend you ignore any haters and see this movie. See it for what it is and see it for the mythos it builds upon. This is not a comic book/superhero movie. But it is an extraordinary film in every regard."
5443,Arthur that be a joker rather be a clown. Finally know how joker distort his mind.
5444,"This movie like all masterpieces is hard to class or define.
The slow ""Taxi Driver"" descent in hell of the most gentle pathetic and lonely human being in this ""pre Giuliani"" styled Gotham, becomes inversely proportional to his charismatic political influence rising among all its more desperate citizens.Those both methamorphosis are described in a fluent and magistral way. The birth of Joker's clown masked followers is so credible to remind real revolutions and viral birth of protests of recent years, like Anonimous or European ""Gilet Jaunes""..After an almost perfect movie the lasts TV show scenes instead of being the top climax of a crescendo take away somehow strenght to the movie. This part could maybe have been developed in a better way.Joaquin Phoenix is undoubtfully unbeatable for those roles and will get an oscar for it.. but Heath Ledger's Joker ghost remains always present there in our memories, absolutely unforgettable...This movie is a disturbing, sad, violent but thanks to a great Joachin Phoenix, fascinating travel into insanity."
5445,"First of all, the end started off slow. It introduced his mental and physical problems and his ""enemies"" in the beginning. It was very painful to see him being hurt and beat up his whole life. I wasn't a huge DC fan, but after this movie, my whole heart has shifted. I thought this would be a normal, boring movie. But this was way more, it included some side characters and their family, which was very shocking to see. You could see his change of weak and unsure about life, to powerful and happy. My heart was aching but at the same time I was waiting for him to snap and become to power joker. I was almost in tears because I can feel his pain even though he's fictional character. All his trama throughout his life was really heart-aching and hard to watch. What I really wanted to see more of is the joker side of him. I loved seeing him happy and powerful! I feel like the message from this movie was to not underestimate anyone and treat everyone with respect. I hope there is a Joker 2. I can't stop thinking about this movie. It's the best movie I have EVER seen in my years of living. If you looked at the sex and nudity warning, there is none really, except some parts where he had his shirt off. There is a lot of violence and CUSSING. But it's very heartwarming and amazing. You honestly don't know where to be amazed or to be sad. There's so much going on in the scenes, however it leads to one big part that makes sense. I want to watch this movie again and again! It's so amazing. You need to see this movie! It is completely worth it and is basically life changing. I may seem like I'm overreacting, but it's true! My whole family is dying over how amazing the acting was. I'm so happy I went to see this. Remember, you were put in this world to spread cheer and laughter. Just keep smiling! 🤡"
5446,"Joker (2019) is powerful, depressing, dangerous, persuasive, and too realistic to be a comicbook movie. And you know what? I.Love.it! This movie is like it's expressing explicitly about the state of nowadays society.Great writing! All the events all the way from the beginning are bonded to each other, they make the ending so satisfying in the smoothest way. The last 30 minutes is jaw-dropping. That Shopie twust thooo!Todd Philips' directing is an A. He translated the script into breathtaking visuals, and they couldn't be any better. Audiences' attention was succesfully drawn into this movie.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is amazing. His portrayal of a man having a mental illnes and living in a broken society is so heartsick, not to mention when he transforms into the Joker himself, sympathized with him till i can't no more.
It was a really nice, and at the same time depressing experience to follow step by step in Arthur's life.Eerie score, it's dark, haunting, and moody. It would definitely suit The Witch (2015), for real! I like it. It really carries the movie and contributes a lot to the atmosphere. This masterpiece of a score is done by the composer behind HBO's Chernobyl and Sicario 2, Hildur Guonadottir.The cinematography is astonishing although not having shown any sceneries, CG shots, and other fancy spectacles. It's pure because of those brilliant raw shots and that beautiful color palette. How the cinematographer captured the filthy New York in the form of Gotham and created a beautiful shallow depth-of-field mostly on Arthur/Joker, it's a sign of heartbreaking moment.This movie could be a masterpiece addition to Park Chan Wook's vengeance trilogy with the title ""Sympathy For Mr. J"". Seriously!"
5447,"What a wonderful performance from Joaquin Phoenix in ""JOKER"". An Oscar is coming for him, I bet yes, because he is fantastic, a complet artist. I'm always words, to describe how I feel about this movie I watched today, because I think it's all said. Congratulations to the director for choosing Joaquin for this role."
5448,"The performance of the actors is more than wonderful. The output is excellent. The story of the film is sad and shocking because it is a reality, especially when the system and society violate the life of a person suffering from mental illness. I do not want to explain the film and its details, but I recommend watching it to know how to create a monster"
5449,"On the contrary to some critics' concern that this movie promotes meaningless violence, Joker does not glorify violence; it instead beautifies insanity with bittersweet and painful sufferings all attached to it, overwhelming the audience with unresolved feelings they never knew existed inside their past dreams, disappointments, aspirations, despair, hope and hurt. Don't be mistaken: Joker does not sugarcoat it or even set aside pains that come from years of abandonment, abuse, mental illness, severe depressions and disorders, and most painfully, the exhausting cycle of daily life after another. Instead, it takes it all in, put into beautifully stark, if not disturbing, images, with captivating soundtrack and music that chills your back even hearing it again long after the movie has ended, like a dark whisper, a reminder that the line between tragedy and comedy is not a line at all-because life is both, never less. Joker does not justify violence, but it attempts to get the audience to see a man's transformation from already troublesome life into the end any shred of sanity he has maintained."
5450,"This movie is a cinematic masterpiece. Virtuoso performance by Joaquin Phoenix. Just finished watching the movie a few minutes back. My mind is still racing thinking about the movie. It is a deep character study of how Arthur Fleck becomes Joker. He was driven to the edge of insanity and boy does he hit back hard. Gotham with all its lawlessness, corruption, prejudice, and insensitivity is rife for violence. His history is twisted. He feels lied to and is torn between truth and lies. The lack of empathy is something Gotham stinks of. He does not care anymore what is reality and what is fiction. It paints a grim picture of how the world is. It is grounded in reality and therefore one can relate to today's society. The ending is what transcends this movie into greatness."
5451,"Dark , gritty , disturbing , bad vibes , masterpiece and phenomenal acting by joaquin phoenix."
5452,"Watched this movie yesterday in Korea.
just stunning.....this is all I can say.
not the best movie tbh, but anyway definitely a must see movie."
5453,"An immersive cinema experience. Tense and psychologically violent, but also contemplative because it is very close to our lives an our society as a whole. The movie show us two political parties but doesn't take any of them. Wich is good! People need to have a clear vision of our society instead start to jump into everyone elses throat. And for that, some people will shout out loud that the movie sucks and some others will glorify it. Well... if you are a healthy person you'll probably contemplate this masterpiece and understand write and wrong... And of course Joaquin was a ""killer"" Joker giving to us an unforgatable performance. I'm looking forward for his oscar as an actor! I could be exaggerating but I think that this movie will carry a lot of nomminations, something like 11! That's it, see ya!"
5454,"The way the disease of psychosis was portrayed, as well as how mental illness can lead to a life of crime due to desperation, was just breathtaking. This movie is genius. I can smell the Oscars already."
5455,"It's been two years or more so since a recent movie made me feel that wow factor and I was craving for a performance to amaze me.Joaquin Phoenix is one of the beat actors today but still it seemed it was hard to compete with Heath Ledger's Joker, well this movie is not a competition at all since they feel like completely two different characters but to me this is one of the best performances I've ever seen on a ""commercially"" movie... I'm not expert on comics but I do love good performances and movies, specially deep ones, Phoenix's Joker is a beautiful psychological study on mental disorder, the movie is really intense and there is not a moment that you feel reminded of past Batman movies or Jokers nor do you ever wish for action to start, you just seat watching this really dark story and taking it all in, few movies give that kind of darkness that you can just feel it, Joaquin's performance really blew me away, it's really painfully brilliant."
5456,No words needed thats all. Legendary....i cant say anything else just worth the best.
5457,"The title says it all. I don't watch movies for a second time because I never saw the point, but for the Joker I really want to."
5458,"In a society where bullying is the norm and the poorest people get the least amount of preventative care, Joker is a testament to how, since the days of ""Taxi Driver"" being made, not much has changed. People who are made to feel outcast, people who are scraping to get by and earn food money, people who are alone, ..... often get kicked by an uncaring system. Man's inhumanity to man is alive and well in today's society and in this film. While set in a different decade the message is the same. I don't know what people mean anymore when they say or thing 'comic book movie' because comic books and characters reflect the minds of their creators. Not unlike ""Natural Born Killers"" the media needs to stop making celebrity out of crazy people and those who do harm to others. The fear of the film inciting violence is ridiculous just as it was with ""V for Vendetta"". This is not a children's film and it's not a comic book film, it's a pure Drama. It could not be more well done. Anyone who doesn't walk away with a new perspective on what it is like to be poor in America should reflect. PS: Stop bulling each other people, we are all we have."
5459,"When I left the movie theater in 2008 after watching the ""Dark Knight,"" I asked myself ""can comic book movies be like this?"" Jump to 2019, after leaving the theater from the screening of ""Joker,"" I asked myself again ""can comic book movies be like this?"" Joker is Todd Phillips' magnum opus that is groundbreaking in its approach to the medium of comic book movies, and is a realistically unsettling look at how society can affect a person to become a heinous criminal. Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance - every tick, giggle, and movement seemed calculated while he was playing Arthur Fleck and when he inevitably turns into the Joker. In the movie Fleck is introduced as having a condition that makes him laugh uncontrollably, and sometimes when he laughed too hard, Phoenix would grab his chest in pain. As a viewer you can empathize with this individual who is marginalized by society, but at the same Phoenix's multi-layered performance hinted at a darker mind full of malice. Joker is definitely a villain, but Phoenix's performance made him a layered villain.I know this movie will do well simply because of America's fascination of true crime documentaries and shows. After leaving the theater, my friend who is also a true crime enthusiast let me know that if she hears, reads, or watches something about a shooter/killer in the news or show, she tries to dig deeper into that person's life, social media, etc. to look for clues as to why that person became such a horrible person. This movie really plays to the audience that loves true crime the most, as Phillips documents one person's turn from regular (but troubled) hard working man, to mass serial killer. It isn't a movie for everybody, but if you understand this movie is from the perspective of the villain, and it is a tragic tale of one man's inevitable fall into madness, then this movie becomes so much more."
5460,"I felt compelled to write a review. First off I would score this 9/10 I put 10 cuz I've seen the 1/10 reviews and that's ridiculous. This movie hit the nail on the head. It sucks you in chews you up and just when you think you figured it out, Hock loogie! it spits you into a chainsaw blade. It will make you laugh and it will make you jerk with shock. I found myself verbally Wooooing in the theater (there was only 1 couple in there with me so it was respectful) If you can't enjoy this movie I don't know what to tell you."
5461,I have seen every movie nominated for picture of the year. Ever. I have watched every nomination for best Actor and Actress. This was the greatest performance I've ever seen. I feel so weird saying this. It's a comic book movie...by DC. But I can't ignore what I've just seen. I've never left a review for a movie on IMDB. TODAY I WAS FORCED TO CHANGE THAT.
5462,"At the end, between stunning and feeling something about it, i noticed that was the far best movie I've ever watched last years (need to think about lifetime). I saw every single detail of the job, technics meet the intense, cinematographer worked great, Joaquin Phoenix was amazing to watch and the best fit for this Joker, and the main Joker as you see in the name of. When I see Joker everytime before this, felt sad not to see a Joker explained with his psychological base and experiences take by take with amazing framing. Not feeling the way ""they sold controlled anarchy"" or ""low job with high budget and talented actor"", every detail caught me while i watch it. It's hard to watch the anarcy with reasons and haunting evil guys in their(maybe our) perceptions. Thanks, just thanks!"
5463,"Honestly, I wasn't expecting much from the trailers and director's track record. I was only interested in seeing how Phoenix does as Joker but I expected the film to be run of the mill and lack substance. Well, it was a masterpiece.I would just say to anyone judging without actually watching, give it a try. If only to see Joaquin Phoenix top Heath Ledger as Joker, which I didn't think would ever happen after Dark Knight.There was a hell of a lot more substance to this than I expected. This was a masterful slow burning character study, showing the transformation of a downtrodden, mentally ill sociopath, into The Joker. And yeah, it's one of the darkest and most uncomfortable comedies you will ever see but it's set up and done very well. Visually great, soundtrack great and Phoenix was unbelievable.This is getting a lot of bad reviews from critics who I guess were made uncomfortable but there are thousands of senselessly violent movies and this was dark as you get, but not senseless.Metacritic currently has an average rating from critics of 57/100, with both the metacritic and imdb users rating it 9.2/10. It used to be that I'd put more stock in the critics than average viewer ratings but it's getting really hard to take modern reviewers seriously when you see the countless generic and badly constructed comic book adaptations and new Star Wars films get a better critical response than an actual piece of art like Joker."
5464,"So, let me start by saying that this is a movie I didn't plan on seeing. My husband wanted to see it, so off we went! This movie is beautiful, chaotic, and the cinematography perfect. When Cumberbatch did Kahn, my thought was he was born to play that role. Joaquin Phoenix was not only born to play this role, but he absolutely OWNS the Joker. He was perfect; if he doesn't win at least one award for this movie, something is definitely wrong! This movie kept me engaged, I didn't want to miss a millisecond. Bravo!!!"
5465,"Acting, bgm and direction are the gems of this movie..."
5466,"What an excellent gritty portrait of a broken society. Joaquin Phoenix nails the part of Joker with elements of his portrait that make the audience laugh, sympathise and repulse all at the same time.The plot is excellent and provides an excellent backstory, which sets up the Batman necessity perfectly. The Jokers many failed and faulty relationships are well portrait and there are are excellent twists with the figments of his imagination mixed with his reality.Although set years ago, the themes certainly resonate with those of today and this makes it a perfect movie for the time."
5467,A Great movie till date #joaquinpheonix is epic . really #riverpheonix gonna be so proud of him.Really he is great and intense actor like his brother.miss you river
5468,"This film is a must see! The hype is real!
This film will have you gripped from start to finish."
5469,"It's the best movies i watched for a long time
definitely one of the best ever"
5470,"Joaquin Phoenix has delivered the most brilliant performance of His life. He deserves an Oscar. Acting, Direction, Cinematography everything is splendid! Hats off to #ToddPhilips"
5471,"If you are a Joker fan. You will love this movie! This take is very dark, but, it is very well written and the acting is incredible! It will at some point put a smile on your face!"
5472,"I LOVED THIS SO MUCH. Brilliantly shot, Brilliantly written and most importantly brilliantly acted. Phoenix needs his Oscar for this movie. Joker is truly crazy, if Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar for this I will truly be shocked, he really went for this and it really shows. I would highly recommend this movie for everyone. It is a MUST see."
5473,"Yet again, Phoenix offers a quintessential, idiosyncratic performance, whereby the audience should be rendered disquiet and thrilled, simultaneously. The sheer perturbation of his act further augments Phillips', ""Joker""; and the contrariety of pain and exuberance clash with one another, engendering this psychotic, iniquitous character. The picture is intriguing in its consideration of the origins of Arthur Fleck (Joker), whom burgeons into the devil of Gotham City. The immensely - IMMENSELY - dark display instilled myself and, as it should, others into loving the persona of Arthur Fleck, with his uncontrollable, volatile behaviour; and, of course, the sporadic laugh: ""HAHAHAHA"". Phillips brings us a brilliant movie, with Phoenix ultimately completing it. Could this, finally, be the Oscar win for Phoenix, he so deserves?Initial rating: 9.1/10"
5474,"This film seems to me so perfect, the cinematography, the camera angles, along with the gritty sickly world depicted and a most interesting colour pallet that creates a psychologically insane scope for viewing. This really put you into the head of Arthur and his disorientated, mentally unstable state. They created a joker so authentic that it's believable what is happening is real, this immerses you into the film all the more which is what a film should do. It's so refreshing to see such a well made character study created in this era. Thankyou Joaquin Phoenix for putting a masterful depiction of this character that is so believable and complex. Scorsese would be proud."
5475,"This film has definitely delivered. What a brilliant theatrical performance from Joaquin, such a talent. Look forward to watching it a second time."
5476,After watching several mediocre heroe movies I must say that I truly enjoy the acting of Phoenix. One of the best movies I saw on the decade. Masterpiece. Film of year.
5477,"I grew up reading & loving graphic novels/comic's (Killing Joke being my favourite) watching all the films, but more importantly adoring the Joker. Now the Dark Knight rises will always be my absolute favourite superhero film, Because it's the complete package, but mainly because of Heath Ledgers Oscar Winning performance and that won't change. BUT after watching this film with the writing, Directing and sublime casting of Joaquin Phoenix & his portrayal of The Clown Prince Of Crime I can honestly say as much as I love Heath's Joker, this take on the Joker is PERFECTLY EXECUTED, it's the most sinister, dark, twisted, profound, hilarious and more importantly most accurate version in my opinion. He deserves an Oscar, this film is FLAWLESS!!!"
5478,"I went into the cinema not expecting anything special.We always get the hype for a ""big movie"" release and 9 times out of 10 they never deliver.oh man does this movie deliver.I didn't take my eyes off the screen from start to finish.the story was great and the acting,especially from Joachin Phoenix was phenomenal.the man's got to get an Oscar.thank you for restoring my faith in cinema."
5479,"As a Ledger fan, I am now also a fan of Joaquin Phoenix's - because he is the Joker. They both are.
From his Oscar-worthy (and more) performance of this legendary character, to the cinematography, and dare I say, everything else - the movie is either a 110 out of 100, or nothing. It takes a person who understands what they're watching here to love this movie. This movie is everything to those, who get it, and nothing to those, who don't want to try to understand it. I loved every single scene. It was extraordinary. It was brilliant. 'Joker' is a masterpiece you haven't seen yet.
It is a ''dream come true'' piece of art, something that will leave you wondering for hours, days, and if you're a movie-lover like me - decades. It is that captivating and magnificently beautiful!"
5480,"Ledger may have set the benchmark for this fictional villain. But Phoenix has just delivered a flawless performance. His take on Joker is immense and is Oscar worthy. In fact if he doesn't win an Oscar for this perfect acting I'll be stunned.
Forget what you know about Gotham batman and the history of DC.
This is a story of a failed comedian who is essentially a psychopath. It's a shame Phoenix only wanted to do a one off movie on the Joker, because a trio of films featuring the Joker would give Nolan's take on The Dark Knight trilogy a huge run for its money.
Very impressed."
5481,"This movie is fantastic, from the superb acting from Phoenix right down to the way the movie really convinces you that Gotham is a living and breathing city that is full of crime and corruption. In this regard, the Joker manages to remind me of Taxi Driver- a movie about one man who is fed up with the world and wants to make a change, no matter the cost. I highly recommend that anyone reading this goes out and watches this movie for themselves before taking one look at critic scores and deciding to give it a pass, because I have a feeling that you'll be pleasantly surprised at just how excellent this movie is."
5482,"Don't go in expecting your typical, run of the mill, overdone action packed superhero movie. It's more of a psychological thriller. Loved every minute. The portrayal of the deep mental illness by Phoenix is Oscar worthy and quite unsettling to watch (in a good way, if that makes sense)"
5483,"First of all, Todd Phillips congratulations!!! Joaquim Phoenix you are kind of a genius!!!
Big, brilliant and best movie for now by DC!!!"
5484,"Great movie ... not a comic book film... a worthy prequel to the dark knight trilogy..I can pay it no higher compliment..wonderful music ..superb lead actor..and a great nod to De Niro in the ""King of Comedy"" .And were those the famous Exorcist steps? Another great film about possession and demons.. except this time the devil is lifeGo see"
5485,"I left the theatre amazed and thrilled by Phoenix's performance, it really looked liked If Phoenix was joker himself and really took on well with what he was given. This is magic behind filmmaking. Even though I am a Marvel fan I still appreciate what other directors do especially what Todd Phillips has done really. The last 20-30 minutes will blow your brains out It's INTENSE"
5486,Great movie. It was a really great movie. It was so satisfing to see. It had everithing i was ecpecting from a Joker movie. Really great on the detalies
5487,"All the words in the world won't be enough to give a fair description of the magnetude of this masterpiece.This picture is absolutely incredibly genius, Phoenix's role-play is unbelievable..."
5488,"This movie was brilliant. A movie that never waivers from start to finish coupled with an awesome sound track. To the detractors, don't over analyse it, after all, it's only a film."
5489,"Without any doubt this is the best take on joker ever , todd phillps has delivered a Masterpiece and Joaquin Phoenix has delivered the best performance in his career. He is my best joker now!"
5490,"Stunning, amazing act from undisputed talent of Joaquin Phoenix, deep, meaningful, powerful 10/10"
5491,"It was a phenomenal movie, with a tone that DC seem to always get right, wether it's the Dark Knight trilogy or Joker, it delivers again and again. The cinematography is beautiful and Joaquin Phoenix's performance is some of the best acting i've seen in a while. The colours of the film stand out and Robert De Niro shines in the role of Murray Franklin. Todd Philips has really outdone himself with this movie and I very much recommend that you go and see it."
5492,"A work of art made with a professional cinematographic eye. 10 to the script, 10 to the direction, and 10 to the actor. I hope he wins the Oscar awards. It should be noted, the psychological influence on the character's development was impeccable. Many winning movies in one."
5493,"This film was unbelievable right down to the very last details. It was dark whilst also providing bits of humour to capture the jokers essence and Joaquin phoenix's portrayal of the joker came close to challenging heath ledgers. The film was a beautiful story of a man pushed to the edge by the challenges of a broken and decaying society and the cast, writers, director and crew all deserve to be praise for making such an outstanding film."
5494,"The Joker tells a tale of a sane man in an insane world. His story is sad, filled with negativity and is very difficult to imagine. Joaquin Phoenix's acting was a ballpark and Todd Philip's direction was spectacular. DC has its eyes set on target, and hopefully, this continues."
5495,"I am no professional journalist or reviewer, but al I can say is that this film was great.
You really understand the character Joker after this film.
Not mutch action, no forced comedy just drama and character building."
5496,"The Joker movie: A story of a mans slow, spiral decent towards darkness and insanity. It humanizes a hidden evil that exists in American culture, and gives it a face: the mask of a clown. A man filled with S-Laughter: A clever juxtaposition between chaos and commedy to expose our societal nonchalance towards the same hidden evil that we know exists, yet do nothing about it. It is a dark movie that should scare you when you think about this hidden evil as you walk past strangers on a daily basis, unknowing how strong the evil exists inside them. It is the true horror story of Americas yesterday and tomorrow, told from the perspective of a fictional character who luckily will never have to live the story out in reality...Our reality. Many Jokers have lived, and if nothing changes many Jokers will continue to come. God help us all."
5497,"JOKER REVIEW: Last night I saw what is quite possibly my most hyped film of 2019, and what I'm thinking is the best film of 2019. It is quite literally a masterpiece and did not disappoint. It was everything I expected and everything I didn't. I've wanted a movie about the Joker for so long but I never thought it would work quite like this. This is NOT comic book Joker, I don't even think we've seen the perfect comic accurate live action Joker on screen yet, but it doesn't need to be comic Joker. This is something new. It's one of the scariest movies I've ever seen but not because there's jumpscares or horror, it's scary because it's so real. I've never been so uncomfortable in a theater, yet I was so engrossed. The violence is briefer than you might expect, but graphically shocking everytime it's on screen. You never no what's going to happen, you never know what Arthur is going to do next. You're waiting for his snap into Joker and you keep guessing until he finally does. This movie has gained some controversy over the message it's trying to tell, but I think it's very clear that Arthur is not the good guy here, we are stuck with the guy who breaks. No one should look up to him and the movie knows this. You sympathize but you aren't rooting for him. Last night I was asked ""Joaquin Phoenix or Heath Ledger?"", and I don't think they're even comparable. They both did something drastically different and amazing with the character, but Phoenix is still spectacular. The rest of the cast is good, Robert De Niro is one of my top 5 favorite actors so seeing him in a DC movie is just great, but this movie wholly surrounds Phoenix. It's his movie. Now I have very little complaints, but I'll say a few things. I wasn't fully engrossed from the start, maybe it was because I was tense, but the movie didn't go from good to great for me until a twist in the middle that confirmed this film's a masterpiece. I have another tiny nitpick but that gets into spoilers. I'd also just like to say the third act was fantastic. The film is terrifying and brilliant. I praise Todd Phillips and Phoenix for creating something so real. Bravo.
Final rating: 9/10"
5498,"Joker spoiler free review. So no surprise I'm another person singing it's praises. It's true, Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal. I'm the person that always routes for the bad guys in films, psychos are always more fun to watch, but this left me with the moral dilemma is he actually the bad guy. I'm not advocating victim blaming in anyway but it did make it hard to feel sorry for the supposed ""victims""
The whole tone of the film felt very current in this capitalist, fat cat era we live in. The rich get richer and nobody cares about the little guy. Add to that the way society treats and deals with mental health issues and it makes for a thought provoking two hours. It's definitely a film of many layers and will need another watch to fully digest it.
I'm not the best person to comment on the whole ""DC"" of it all as I'm not a Batman fan, so it's best I leave that element to someone who is but I was fully immersed into it by just knowing the bare minimum. I could have happily have watched it for another hour. Believe the hype."
5499,"If you're interested in a movie that shows you the world of the Joker that's never been showed before, then this is it. Joaquin Phoenix portrays a very good version of the Joker. How he became the person he became, what drives a mad man to the brink of insanity, what makes you a crazy person?
This movie nailed it! Just when I felt that the pace was slowing down it picked up again.Metacritics giving this 58? Politics and nothing else. People applauded at the end of the movie, which I haven't experienced since I saw the Gladiator on the day of the premiere."
5500,"I saw this in a cinema in Sheffield, England. I have never seen an audience applaud a film at the end of viewing in a cinema - until now.An excellent character analysis, showing why a man would turn into a monster.Disturbing, thrilling, intense. Heath Ledger's joker was incredible, and I may be getting caught up in the hype of experiencing this film for the first time, but I believe Joaquin Phoenix's joker is the standard that all other Joker's will be compared too from now on.Whether you're a comic book fan or not, a fan of the Joker character or not - this is a truly great film. A critique of modern society, a deep dive into severe depression, all in the back drop of the most famous comic book setting with the most iconic comic book villain of all time.I cannot wait to see this film again."
5501,Super acting. I need to applaud This acting. the camera is great and the Music City is perfect. it's like acting monitored unutterable masterpiece.
5502,"No spoilers here. I just got back from watching joker. I don't understand any of the negative reviews I read previously. This was superb. Phoenix is outstanding and rivals Ledgers Joker for me now (never thought I'd say that).
It's dark, very little humour and to begin with fairly slow but as it played out to its climax I was enthralled and wanted more as the titles rolled ( I'm sure this will set up further films in a new franchise with Phoenix the star)
I highly recommend this movie."
5503,"""In my whole life, I didn't know if I even really existed. But I do. And people are starting to notice.""
This quote is all that you need to understand the essence of this film. The very definition of Vanity is questioned and it showed how of nihilism is ingrained in people's belief. A harmless human being can wreak havoc on society because of one's despair and one's extensional crisis. It can lead to disarray and can also lead to terrorism in a collective sense. Still, the part of one's transitional period to that deranged mindset is very sad and a bit rational to an extent. This film is much more relatable to reality rather than a mere comic book adaptation. No wonder why there was a seven minutes long standing ovation for this film in the Venice Film Festival.As for the plot, the early 80's is the best era to portray the origination of the Character called ""Joker"". As a part of the audience, it felt so real because of that specific timeline. Thanks to the persuasion of Todd Philips to make this an R Rated film. This dark side of the society and unleashing rage of a simpleton can never be understood in a PG-13 film. Demonstration of this kind paves away to a different dimension for the Comic Book Movies.As for Joaquin Phoenix, this man was underrated for quite a long time. Gladiator was the first film where I watched his performance as an antagonist. Then, I watched several of his films over time. i.e. Her, Two Lovers etc. As for this movie, this was the first of its kind maybe. He had to be the protagonist in a film where the character of that protagonist itself is engulfed in the nature of an antagonist. But he managed to portray that character just about right, as if he was composing a symphony in perfect harmony. Heath Ledger's expressions while being the JOKER were a bit more intense in my opinion. Although we cannot compare these two men, because their aspects were totally different than one another.Music and sound editing was quite good enough.Color tone of this movie is jaw-dropping. It sets the mood to the way it should be.As for the DC-Marvel debacle, I'm not trying to pick a side to fuel meaningless quarrels. All I'm saying is that DC used its dark essence and rich character developments to a whole new level. I am more than satisfied with this comeback of DC in the cinematic universe. Now, we kind of have a sub-genre for the comic book movies.The last but not the least, I'm not spoiling anything by saying that the ending was perfect. The foreshadowing effect may get over some of your heads, but that was poetic.""I used to think that my life was a tragedy. But now I realize, it's a comedy.""
The rating should be 9/10 in my opinion."
5504,"This movie is a must see for all you movie goers.
This might be the best movie delivered to us from Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips"
5505,"I loved it. It was shot beautifully, the music, the tones, the emotion, everything. Now, I have to say I am not a fan of Superheroes of any sort or anything related to them, but this is a story on its own. Just forget about the hype, the previous jokers and everything you have seen and watch it and let it fill you with that intense mixture of emotions. I rate it 10/10 because of the way everything goes so well together in this film on its own. I don't necessarily think its one of the best films ever made but for this theme and on its own its very well made."
5506,"Watch it!
Such an amazing actor Joaquin Pheonix is!
Thank you Todd Phillips."
5507,"Since Nolan's Batman trilogy DC movies haven't lived up to expectations. Man of Steel a slight disappointment, Dawn of Justice even bigger and Justice league was a nightmare. Suicide Squad was hideous. Almost lost my hope.Today went to see the Joker and it was brilliant. New angle, more loyal to original stories and comics. Very grim, dark and made me feel anxious whilst watching. Something we haven't seen before and Joaquin made a the iconic character his own. Tragic figure that society pushes to insanity.If the upcoming Pattison's Batman is going to be more grim and crime/thriller/detective themed as some sources have suggested and we get to see Joaquin's Joker in it, then we might see something special.Joker is a masterpiece."
5508,Heath Ledger would be very proud of Joaquin Phoenix here exceptional performance Oscar worthy! Joker is an incredible film very dark and twisted keeping the audience captivated and on the edge of their seat at all times! I am a huge fan of the character and this film has done The Joker proud. Highly recommend!
5509,After Dark Knight I don't know I will watch a real joker again or not every time someone play joker character on screen I get always dispoint by their performance .But Waits Is over now guys this is a awesome movie..it is not just an movie it is a emotion .I Don't have words to express my feelings...this is beyond my expectation ...what an performance .....amazing ....😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
5510,"I watched Joker today. I was expecting a lot from Joaquin Phoenix. He didn't disappoint.
He has really studied the flaws of a mentally disturbed person in a heartless society and portrayed those insecurities to perfection.
The direction is top drawer as is the script. The film tilts its hat at several of the past portrayals of the Joker in a subtle way.
I believe this film actually beats The Dark Knight to the No.1 DC film and quite possibly one of the best all time films.
Mesmerising"
5511,"Not the comic book joker, this was a real cinema movie and a dark travmatic jokerish story. Its like we gonna do a characther very similar to joker but his conditions and problems will be all real like this could be a real guy. Yeah good acting good director good score good plot everything about this movie is good."
5512,The construction of the character is just mind blowing. Went without any expectation yet at the end people even clapped. Just brilliant!
5513,"Best movie I've seen since Green Book, nothing compares to this breath taking movie. Brilliant and astonishing acting by an amazing actor. Joaquin Phoenix is a true legend and will need to win the oscar for best performance because it was remarcable and unforgetable."
5514,"Honestly, there wasn't a single thing that I thought that could have been better. The acting, the plot, the cinematography...all perfect!
A touching movie. In many ways."
5515,"Revolutionising comic book movies. Left me with my heart pumping, goosebumps and chills throughout. Insanely tense, shocking and unpredictable. No doubt it will do really well come awards season. Perfection."
5516,I love this movie ❤❤ jocker is the best 😍😍😍😍😍
5517,"It's not about glorifying a monster, it's about a society which creats monsters."
5518,"#JOKER lives up to the hype. If you care about movies and society this movie will prompt you to think about several scenes hours after watching it.I grew up hip-hop. I remember media and politicians attacking hip-hop stating that the music incites violence. I remember Z104 editing all hip-hop lyrics out of R&B songs. It was preached that a person rapping no matter the subject, was a detriment to society. In my youth we traveled through many cities that had no stations that played 90s hip-hop. I had a family member that lived and went to all white, wealthy schools and they couldn't stand hip-hop. They saw it as violent stories that pushed people to want to be thugs. Because they were family, my teenage-self pushed to get them to understand that; that you have to listen to it, before you can judge it. Dismissing it, isn't going to stop it. White America is on record for stating their beliefs, that hip-hop would die out with in 10 years. (Like Disco). Their avoidance of viewing the art that talks about real problems, real pain, real life either cites away or down the block will not work. 12 hours after seeing JOKER, I woke up feeling that JOKER is a must see. You can be the individual that believes a movie will influence killers by showcasing a fictional killer's origins or be the person that believes a movie can tell the story about the path that people are already on to become murders. Our problems with mental illness & suicide/killer gene is already here. It is as relevant as either. How many weeks since the last mass shooting?? How many people have been arrested for violent crimes, that if they were tested it would show this person has problems on a biological level? The reason these individuals are dealt with after their 10th victim is usually because the lack of attention to the problem, lack of necessities to fix the problem, and/or the lack of belief in the problem. JOKER highlights the world that so many people choose not to believe exist. Everyday, every 65 minutes a military/vet commits suicide. It's hard to review this movie, without attaching it to real life.Joaquin Phoenix is a master class actor, with a deep resume of classic roles. This will be consider his best and most haunting. You know the story, and yet you yearn for a happy ending, but then you're reminded happy is relative to the situation and person. Very little action and yet this movie has you on the edge of your seat. Unlike Halloween were you're waiting for Jason to die, with Joker you're engaged from start to brilliant finish. The Joker's death is not your target.In the comic-book world, Batman is the only one that can take down a psychotic killer like the Joker. I'll buy this movie on Blu-ray, but it won't be something I'll watch on the regular (unless I'm studying it for movie making material). It cuts deep, but the best thing about this movie is that it displays real problems and the blueprint of a mass killer - but we, us, you and I can treat these people before art predicts the future. No Batman required. Drug problem caused fatherless homes, crime rates rose, America ignored it. People from those areas told stories about it. America rejected it, and cited the art, the songs, the movies cause the problem. And the cycle continues. This film illustrates the cure.The Joker will battle The Irishman this award season. Joaquin will probably win a Oscar. More than winning awards, I pray Joker starts funding programs for mental health. (It's that powerful of a movie.) Our society doesn't like to read, but this movie can inject some type of care into the right people's minds to start childcare facilities to treat PTSD victims. This movie can change laws. But first it has to change your perception. Joker is one of the best films of the decade. Our current world, has made sure of it."
5519,I just saw 'Joker' (2019) at my local theater and it was a masterpiece! Give Phoenix his Oscar now!
5520,"Joker review:Okay, so.. Let's just get in to this shall we? First off, this movie is not your typical, Dark Knight, Batman villian story. It's very much an origin story and by origin I mean the very beginnings of what the joker becomes. That being said, it was nothing short of a masterpiece, I see a few oscar nominations in the future. Joaquin did an amazing job, as did Robert De Niro. This movie pushes the bounadries of what it means to be deranged and mentally ill and suffering. But laughing it off and slowly giving in to madness. This movie makes you uncomfortable at times, makes you feel for this character. Like he isn't a villain, you see the fall and reality of it all. I really don't think I blinked for the whole 2 hours of the movie. It honestly has a The killing Joke vibe, but it's expanded out in to much more than ""One bad day"" Joaquin has the mannerisms and style I would expect the joker to have. It's violent, really violent of a movie. Goodfellas, The godfather type stuff. I recommend this movie for any comic book fan and anyone interested in a good thriller, drama. I will comfortably give this move a 9.5/10 in my personal opinion. It's on par with Heath's joker from the dark knight for various reasons, just gives you a whole new look at the rising up of the crown prince of gotham"
5521,Slow steady on the mark what a movie we got the chamce to watch what happens with batman parents simply outstanding the movie was
5522,"Joker (2019) is a super intense and emotional ride that in the end leaves you terrified but also weirdly satisfied. On terms of story I would say it's good but relatively basic. But the well directed tension, the cinematoraphy and Phoenix's A-maaazing performance take it to a whole other level. One thing I can't decide on is how much I liked the last scene. On the one hand I found it a bit underwhelming compared to the scene that came before it that could have been a good finale, on the other hand I think it helped ease the feelings of distress that had gathered up in me at that point."
5523,"I'm a massive Nolan/Heath/Bale fan and was in two minds about going to see this (especially after the suicide squad version of the joker).
But I was pleasantly surprised.
I went in wanting to hate it, but by the end credits I was almost punching the air. If your after an emotional response - you'll find it here.
Pacing does lag a little in the middle, but picks up nicely towards the end. Didn't spoil my enjoyment.
Critics seem to be split - but I think the negative reviewers are getting caught up in the ""noise"" around this film. Judge it as a film - not a social commentary."
5524,"Joaquin Phoenix is Arthur Fleck, the man who would be Joker. The entire movie is a character study on this man, with little themes interlaced such as mental illness and the divide between the wealthy and the poor. Unlike other attempts at the Joker's origin, this one did not take one bad day, but years and years of relentless abuse, trauma, and depression. We watch Arthur as he goes from one miserable day to the next, as everything gets worse and worse, and then he gets kicked while he's down for good measure (sometimes literally). This makes it a long, miserable, and uncomfortable viewing experience. The character we all know as Joker is barely present until the film's third act. Until then it's just Arthur Fleck and his descent into madness in a cruel and uncaring world.Joaquin Phoenix deserves every drop of praise he's getting. Every little bit of it. He's dream casting for a role like this, as it feels like Joker was written for him and only him. He's always been fantastic with tormented characters, those who skirt the borders of insanity. And not just movie insanity, but actual insanity. The darkness one's mind goes to when all hope is lost and happiness is an unknowable entity, when waking up every morning feels like stepping into a cold void, where you're trapped in your own head, you can't tell what's real and what's delusion. Phoenix taps into those feelings like a walk in the park. He slips into the role so well you have to keep slapping yourself to remind you you're empathising with a sociopath. His take will divide audiences. Some will find him hilarious, like a dark mirror of Charlie Chaplin, while others will watch him with intense sadness.Nothing encapsulates this better than his laughs. Yes, laughs, plural. Phoenix is not happy with just one iconic laugh. Instead he gives Joker a number of distinct laughs, and each of them are just as unnerving and characterful as the others. His fake laugh is the closest to a typical Joker laugh we get. He uses it at odd, inappropriate moments, or as an attempt to fit in with those around him. The way he cuts from a serious expression to manic laughter, and then back to a serious expression is equal parts hilarious and disturbing. He's lonely and detached from society. He doesn't know what makes a good joke. He doesn't find humour in the same things everyone else does, so in an effort to appear normal he puts on a fake laugh; over-the-top and terrible. His other laugh is an involuntary tick due to a mental condition, either from illness or injury. It's loud and hearty. And yet also grossly inappropriate. This time it isn't Arthur trying to fit in, it's a reflex he can't help, and usually comes out in moments of great stress or sadness. These moments are uncomfortable to watch because you can feel his desperation to make them stop. These are tragic, painful laughs masking tears.The other star of the movie is Hildur Guðnadóttir's haunting and upsetting score. It's a stripped-down orchestral score, centred on a handful of cellos. It evokes the tragic nature of Arthur's life, while also remaining dark and tense, putting you at constant unease. It uses silence and atmospheric lulls brilliantly, allowing the rest of the film to breathe before the overpowering single Cello line bursts back in. Even in Joker's final triumphant moment at the end of the film, the score still feels overpoweringly dark and brooding. This is no hero we're witnessing, this is a villain of pure evil and insanity.Joker is not your average comic book movie. Go in expecting a typical superhero origin and you'll be disappointed. There's no antagonist, no brazen action sequences. It's slow and methodical, the violence is sudden and disturbing, but used incredibly sparingly. Also for a film entitled 'Joker' it's not particularly funny either. It has its moments of genuine humour for sure, but usually the level of comedy is so dark you'd feel bad for laughing at it. There was a guy in my screening who, much like Arthur, was laughing at the most inappropriate moments and literally applauding the violence. It was like Arthur was in the cinema with me watching his own movie. It was unnerving, but mostly I couldn't understand how he didn't see the irony in it. You'll either find this movie a darkly hilarious comedy, or find the experience closer to a deeply upsetting traumatic event. We may never see another film like this, but it may also open the eyes and minds of major studios to what they can achieve with comic book material. An R-rated villain origin, in the style of a gritty indie drama, focussing on the depravity of mental illness. I give Joker a potentially industry-changing 9/10."
5525,"Positives:+ Joaquin Phoenix gives a tremendous performance as a meager man that slowly descends deeper, and deeper into the bowels of his own madness. He nails the laugh even better than Ledger did, and at first while he doesn't command much presence on screen, as the film pushes on he becomes more, and more disconnected from reality, he transforms into a person who owns every scene.+ The film's cinematography by Lawrence Sher (The Hangover, Godzilla: King of the Monsters) is incredible, and nearly all of the selected shot composition throughout the film is stunning. It is a grim, dark, and murky film to watch, but it also carries a strange beauty from one transition to the next.+ The film's story may seem somewhat shallow at first glance, but it is filled with plenty of intrigue, and depth. It keeps the audience guessing as to what Joker will do next, and never once falls back on tropes or cliches.+ This is first, and foremost a character piece. It is not some high budget action, crime shoot 'em up as some may desire. The film takes it time to set the stakes, and build the tension until it snaps like a guitar string. Leaving the viewer in awe.+ The pacing is superb, and 2 hours went by super quickly. Even the slow scenes aren't inherently slow as they leave the viewer on edge due to either the uncomfortable nature, and spiraling tension.+ There are plenty, PLENTY of easter eggs, and subtle comic references that will excite any DC diehard. There are also many moments, and shots that most will recognize from previous comics, games, and film. This film never once goes heavy handed with the references. So, you won't have to worry about them breaking immersion.+ The film is very hilarious in some parts to an almost ""black comedy"" degree of dry humor. This is definitely needed to bring some moments of levity in an otherwise very serious film.+ The score is good, and features a plethora of solid song choices that convey the overall tone, and depth of the film itself.+ Todd Phillips may have been a surprise pick for some to direct, but he really nails the little things that make a film smooth to watch, and experience. I was never taken aback by any strange directorial choices, or questionable editing. The film is as smooth as it is intelligently written.Negatives:A couple characters aren't as fleshed out as I would've liked, but those characters didn't need to be written that way due to their overall insignificance in the mind of the Joker.Some of the CGI blood is noticeable in one scene in particular, but it doesn't detract from the viewing experience in the slightest.It ends.Rating: 10 out of 10Final Thoughts: Joker is the first attempt at a standalone film based on the DC Comics character of the same name. Many people had mixed feelings when it was first announced, but after Joaquin Phoenix's name was attached to the project many people, myself included, started to buy in to the hype.From the moment the film starts there exists a palpable tension that something is just ""off"", and that feeling never ceases especially as Arthur slowly begins his spiral downward into the Joker identity. The uneasiness, and distressing nature is unrelenting as the film progresses until truths are revealed, and things happen that may or may not be the result of Arthur succumbing to, and slipping into his deepening insanity.The film's most impressive positive for me is how intelligent it is, it never holds the audience's hand. It just expects you to either pick up on the meanings, and follow the story from beginning to end without being lost. Any film that respects it's intended audience is worthy of praise.In summation, Joker is a fantastic interpretation of the legendary character, and it will no doubt receive it's share of praise. It is a very layered film with many meanings, and plenty of symbolism that reflects the modern day struggles that many have with mental illness. Especially undiagnosed mental illness, and how some people view those that have mental health problems as unimportant, and how if untreated or unappreciated they can turn into a psychopath. This is not a kid film, as it does not have Batman (obviously) or any sort of action that a kid would undoubtedly want to see. This is a film created for diehard fans of DC, Batman, and the Joker himself. It is a love letter to those who have been awaiting a DC film on the level of the Nolan Batman trilogy.I highly urge everyone to see this film, and decide how they feel for themselves because I am positive that many will not like this style of movie for the character of the Joker. Personally, this film is near flawless for what it was aiming to accomplish, and while at first I walked out with mixed feelings after digesting what I had just saw, I have really no complaints with this movie, and will most certainly be seeing it again."
5526,"58 on Metacritic!!! What?! Few times do I disagree with their score. This is certainly one of those times.This film has been controversial from the very moment it screened on festivals. It's something I truly don't get. Aren't we way past the ""movies and video games are the cause of violence"" narrative? Why is this coming back? It's such an outdated view. Watch Chris Stuckmann's stand on the issue. The guy gets it spot on.Now... on to the movie itself. I came into this film with pretty high expectations. It won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival and got an eight-minute standing ovations. After watching it, I can see why. Few times have I felt the urge to stand up and clap at the end of a movie. This is a thought-provoking piece of cinema. I've seen some negative reviews say it's a poor social commentary. With all due respect, I don't think those people understood the film. I didn't view it so much as a social commentary piece, but rather a portrayal of the effects a harsh society can have on a person with mental health and psychological childhood trauma. It is a bit on-the-nose at times, but it mostly works and makes you feel for the protagonist, which is something a good screenplay does. If you have a villainous character, you want to have the audience on their side at the beginning of the movie. Otherwise, you will lose them. These aren't characters that have arcs for the best; they've for the worst, and if they're dislikable from the get-go, you're audience won't be invested in them for the rest of the film. I found that the script did a terrific job in exploring the character. You really do feel his pain and anguish. You want him to get out of the bad situation that he is in. You want him to succeed and be happy. When things only get darker and the characters gradually starts to flip, it's a scary and unsettling change to witness. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, bitting your nails, not wanting things to go south. When they inevitably do, you can't look alway. You are disturbed, but you're eyes are glued to the screen. It is massively effective.Joaquin Phoenix proves why he is the best actor working today. His performance is terrific. It is chilling, vulnerable, sad, and tragic. Is this the year he finally gets his Academy Awards? Let's hope so.The score the movie offers is also fantastic. Atmospheric, dark, and at times, disturbingly fun.All around, this film wasn't just an experience. It stays with you well after you leave the theater, and I can't wait to watch it again. Best movie I've seen this year thus far and I hope awards are much kinder to it than critics were. I do believe this is one of those pictures that is going to prove them wrong with time, same way 2001, Citizen Kane, Psycho, and Blade Runner did."
5527,A great movie with great acting.
5528,"After i heard about the 10min standing ovation i was ecpecting one of the best movies ever. It was a fantastic movie, but based on the hype i expected just a bit more. Most of the scenes are also already shown in the trailer which was a bummer. But still the best movie ive seen all year."
5529,"One of the most powerful hero you can watch on screen is Batman. You already know B-man vs Mr.J is the thing on every film, every animation movie, every game about Batman. Today, the biggest villain of DC show the world how truly who he is. This film really make us feel like on a trip to the land of depressing.
Fear, desperated, disregarded by society and struggle in vain. Grow up with a bunch of lies around him, anti-social not what he want, but if he don't fight back , he will drown in the lees of Gotham. Then, he become a demon and make violence actions make all of us feel aghast at the end of the movie. Psychological developments of Joker is so smooth. Frenetic, chaos and enticing. At the moment he make that sign to Sophie, i'm sure it is the key to unlock the way we want to see at Joker. Heath Ledger would be proud of Joaquin 'bout what did this day. A standalone story cleverly integrated some scenes everyone know into this Film, make it related to bigger picture in DCU. It will be darker after this. Brilliant movie - breathtaking, always try to assume what meaning behind all stuff. Especially remind us be kind to one another .' Thanks WB for this. Hope Joker can be more obsessed in the future."
5530,"I cannot even find the words to describe this movie, especially the last act of it. Joaquin tore this role to shreds. I was very very afraid that it wouldn't live up to the masterful trailer, but the journey you take with Arthur is so engrossing that by the time you get to the end, you want more.And for an origin story to do that, world-build, character development at its peak, neutral stance on political topics, topped with Joaquin. The late night talk show scene is the Joker I hope to see more of in any kind of way.It definitely takes its time building but by no means is it boring at all, especially when you get to about halfway through. It all makes perfect sense. In reality 8.5/10. It reminds me of ""Batman Begins"" the perfect origin."
5531,"Joker was a great Origin movie that actually was not an origin story. This movie is not for marvel fans who laughs the predictable childish jokes of marvel movies. the movie has lots of jokes from Joker but each of them gives you a thought instead of laugh. the laugh of Joker gave me mixed feelings each time i heard he didnt copy what Heath did but he created brilliant style of his own. this story line still caries a lot of things from the comic books which i can not spoil here.
Joaquin played an excellent character here. You literally see his changes and craziness in his eyes through out the movie. How can he succeed that transform is beyond my understanding.
Directing also deserves an Oscar just because Todd made a great work to show us how once poor man becomes a mass murdering killer. The story-line was fluid with some twists which made even more better.And last thing that people are wondering! Who is better Joker?
Joaquin or Heath?
My opinion that would not be a correct comparison. Joaquin portrayed a normal man who became Joker, while Heath was already playing an established character Joker. Even though both played the same character, Joker has transformation and character thorough out his time. In my humble opinion Joaquin also deserved Oscar.But both of them did a fantastic job for playing such a hard character.
I am planning to see it again."
5532,"I got down and had a lot of thoughts after the movie. Joaquin was show the mind of criminal who has a complex mind and good heart lived in filthy society
Cannot just put him and Heath Ledger on a scale because they was the best on their ways. The way to show us why this society made people like Arthur become Joker"
5533,You will either love it or hate it! There is no inbetween!
5534,"Amazing movie, Joaquin Phoenix is one of the best actors ever and this is his master piece, the director Todd Philips makes an awesome job, besides many people don't trust in him and the photography is beautiful, everything smells Oscar."
5535,Jesus Christ this movie! The last hour of this movie was by far the most tense I've been watching a movie in a long time! But even before that with the sort of slow build-up it's impossible to take your eyes off the screen! Also I must say I feel like I can't say this is better that heath ledgers joker but phoenixes is just a whole different beast and is a sight to behold
5536,"I still remember the excitement I had when I saw the Batman, I was 10 years old ,then saw it for more than 5 times throughout my childhood years and every time I saw it I couldn't find a reason why the joker is so evil but that didn't mean I lost the excitement. The dark knight was released and Micheal Caine or Alfred gave some reasons to the joker evilness ""some men aren't looking for any thing logical like money, they can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch The world burn"".
When I watched the joker yesterday it added more reasons to his evilness and unpredictable doings with challenging performance compared to the deceased Heath Ledger. The joker performance by Joaquin Phoenix added a new approach to the character, starting from his laugh, posture and attitude down to his inner conflict. The protagonist journey from Arthur fleck to joker shows how society can have a massive impact on Arthur descend into madness also giving another reason to the hatred for the Bruce Wayne family. It's not a joke to hurt someone's feelings and it's not a joke to think that you're infamous by making a couple of dollars.
I don't agree or disagree with the joker but I felt so bad about our humanity and what we could say or do that turns one of us into a criminal and if something happens to any human being rich or poor known or a nobody we should all care.The joker is astonishing and a wake up call for humanity ,Joker ""some people will get the joke and others won't"". Before I watch the movie I thought it's a tragedy but after watching I realized it's a comedy.
JOKER ""I used to think my life is a tragedy but now i realize it's comedy""HAHAHAHA."
5537,"Nothing you've read or heard about Todd Phillips' Joker can really prepare you for just how disturbing it really is. It's not that it's the darkest film ever made. It's the genre that it attaches itself to. ""Comic book"" movies, even the darkest or most violent (think Logan or Blade) are still designed to entertain rather than disturb. True, they deliver emotional moments such as certain character deaths in Logan or Avengers: Endgame that leave an impact; but few, possibly none, have been designed to truly disturb the viewer and creep under the skin - until now.Is Joker a good film or just a disturbing one? You would have to be both to be effective. Just watching a deranged person senselessly murder people on screen wouldn't keep an audience, or at least a sane audience, engaged. Joker benefits from a slow burn that never feels slow; a deliberate pace that feels just that - deliberate. Phillips wants his audience to spend adequate time with this character; not so we can sympathize with his him, but so we can understand him. In doing so, the filmmakers have made us unwitting accessories to Arthur's (Joker) hideous actions. This combination of incendiary writing (Phillips and Scott Silver) and patient editing (Jeff Groth) makes the build up to the unpredictable final act much more rewarding than it would have been in a more frenetically-paced film.The film also looks amazing. Lawrence Sher's cinematography often takes unique and interesting angles without feeling awkward of overly-artsy. The production team has done an amazing job of making this film feel like its been un-vaulted straight from the 1970s. Many period films look like their respective eras, but it takes a considerable amount of talent and craft to make them feel like the era. As a result, 1970s Gotham feels authentic and like a character in its own right. There's also an intense score here by Hildur Guðnadóttir. Sometimes it feels intrusive - and this may bug some viewers. I believe this is completely intentional; intending to unnerve us even further.Joker boasts a talented cast including Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Frances Conroy, Brett Cullen and Brian Tyree Henry. Everyone is good in their roles, but this is really Joaquin Phoenix's show - and the rest of the cast is mostly there to propel his character forward. I believe many will consider this Phoenix's best best performance to date. I certainly found it to be one of his best (I still have a soft spot for his performance in Her). This is an interesting take on the Joker character in that they've nearly stripped him of any likability. Not that Joker is meant to be likable - but there is a certain amount of entertainment value in previous interpretations of the character - certainly in Nicholson's and Romero's, and even in Ledger's darker version. But this Joker is not at that point yet. This is an origin story. Arthur is a disturbed individual with serious mental illnesses. What we see is the result of taking such a man and ripping away his treatment, medications and any sort of sympathy from those surrounding him. Add to that downright mistreatment from others, and it's what takes a troubled man with a reasonable sense of right and wrong and turns him into a diabolical killer incapable of such moral distinctions. It's how Athur becomes Joker. Watching Phoenix unfold all this is mesmerizing. He shows us a man on the brink of implosion, who turns his frustration into violent explosion in the final acts. All the talk of awards consideration around Phoenix's performance here is definitely deserved.About three quarters into Joker, I considered to myself whether American mainstream audiences were ready for a film like this. We've seen such characters before in movies like Taxi Driver, Silence of the Lambs, or even less violently in There Will Be Blood. But I think moviegoers as a whole have certain expectations from movies that exist with the genre of popular comic book adaptations - especially when they feature characters as well-known and even liked as the Joker. Can audiences enter a comic book movie with an open mind, ready not to be entertained, but provoked? Can we allow a comic book movie to lead us to important conversations about societal treatment of mental illness and violence in media? Can we say this is a new type of comic book movie? Or do we have to say this isn't really a comic book movie at all - it's a dark, dramatic thriller that happens to be connected to a comic book universe? Can we accept that Joker is just a darn well-made film without cramming it into genre constructs? One thing to consider is that even the darkest or most violent comic book movies are fantastical. Logan and Deadpool are about mutants with super-powers, Blade is about vampires. But Joker is very realistic. This is a story of a man who could exist and a series of events that could definitely happen. This realism makes the film just that much more unnerving. Over-analyzing any movie can definitely hurt one's perception of it and even distract from its qualities. This is one case however where I believe the more one thinks about it the more you'll want to analyze and deconstruct it - in a good way - not to find it's flaws, but rather it's overall meaning.I'm docking a point for an unnecessary epilogue that distracts from a perfect ending point one scene earlier. There's also a frustrating ambiguity regarding the fate of a pair of characters that I wish the film would have been more transparent about. But these are minor complaints for a movie that will stand out as one of the most interesting and uneasy times I've had at the cinema this year. (9/10) (A-)"
5538,"Great character development, Joaquin Phoenix killed this movie. He did something extraordinary, the facial expressions, the lines, and the acting were very great."
5539,"This movie is a slow burn but the lessons you learn from this movie put use them in your everyday life. You are ugly and mean to people and you create these monsters. And when these monsters bite. Society says we dont understand why they act like this. They took his meds, his mother lied to him, they beat him up, and they laughed at him. When he explosives he explosives. You feel bad for him but you know he is doing wrong. But the best line is ""everyone gets what they deserves"""
5540,I think Phillips took an a somewhat avante-garde approach and I loved it! Not everyone Is going to like this movie. Don't come into the movie expecting the typical superhero/villain type BS.
5541,"""JOKER"" 2019 REVIEW (no spoilers)There has been memorizing buzz about the ""JOKER"" 2019 ever since the Venice Film Festival praise and rumors of an eight-minute standing ovation for Joaquin Phoenix hit the press. There was no way I was going to miss this opening night! As I passed several armed Chicago police officers surveying the movie theatre lobby, it became clear to me that all the conversations revolving around this film were extremely relevant! Discussions about violence, mental health, social status, subjective comedy, crime, movements/revolutions, and the unconventional anti-hero are all woven in the fabric of Todd Phillips' Gotham.""Gotham has lost its way"" - said by Thomas Wayne sparks a tear in the psyche of the city. I believe the ""JOKER"" 2019 addresses what could happen... what kind of world can explain what Arthur Fleck turns into. This film is a true origin story to one of the most widely known and repeated villains. Joaquin Phoenix's performance yo-yos between unsuitability and knowing himself for the first time.I recommend this film to anyone who can stomach the violence of ""Taxi Driver"" and ""You Were Never Really Here."" Both of these slow-burning character studies have been said to have influenced ""JOKER"" 2019 and it shows. There are significant character chapters throughout the film bouncing back and forth cued by music, dancing and laughing offbeat.SMALL thing about the stairs... I have a small theory/observation but do not want to say anything just yet. Going down vs. going up is all I can speak on now.Cheers, I hope you go to the theatre soon!"
5542,"This might be my first movie review here. Im still thinking about this film the next morning. As a 50 yr. old female, I wasn't sure what to expect when I tagged along with my sons and husband to see this. I'm not a huge comic book fan however I've seen most films in this genre. I must say, this is the BEST I've seen. It is so intensely deep and brilliant! Joaquin Phoenix will get an Oscar, I'm most positive. His performance is more than deserving. I highly recommend! Can't wait to see it again!"
5543,Such a great movie and deeply storyline after long time a great movie I have seen.
5544,"""You get what you deserve.""
And we as fans deserved this movie.
Before you go into theatres,
Do remember,
celebrate the acting,
not the character.
Yes, the world is getting crazier,
yes people treat each other like trash
and yes,
we expect a mentally ill person to behave as if they don't :') but do remember, we all have a joker inside us, just never let it take over the sane side of yours.
Coming to the movie,
From the starting minute to the very ending,
it was a display of sheer brilliance.
From the acting to cinematography and finally the soundtrack, everything just clicks.
Though people who are thinking it is about the
joker we all celebrate, the one we loved in dark knight, they have to remember that it is an ORIGINS STORY. There are no ifs no buts, there are no big ventures or plans, it is just how the actual concept of joker came into picture, what made a normal person turn against the society and how anyone can be a joker, the clown but they don't have to and also how it all just fits because remember,
that's LIFE.
Stunned.
Overwhelmed.
Enchanted.
All hail the clown prince of Gotham City.
#PutOnAHappyFace"
5545,Performance from Joaquin Phoenix is truly captivating.
5546,"Joaquin delivers again. Amazing performance. I love seeing the backstory of certain characters. It makes you really understand their actions, feel their pain & adds some extra layers.I didn't know whether to be frightened, or feel sorry for Arthur. That's exactly the feeling you should have watching a movie like this.Amazing!"
5547,"I will start with saying it's an ABSOLUTE BEAUTY. It's dark, it's real, it's powerful and bang on.
Do not take your kids.
The script is perfect, the story takes it's needed pace, the plot twists are awesome. And the acting is phenomenal. Joaquin is taking Oscar for this.
The movie touches the untouched parts of reality of current society and how it can drive a man crazy. The last 20 minutes are heart wrenching and phenomenal. The movie will leave you with a thought and make you see the harsh reality of current society. I'll just end this with saying: That's Life. A must watch."
5548,It's an instant classic and a movie of generations there is a lot of quotable dialogues and great Well played scenes. Plus the score is amazing.
5549,"I watched this movie last night and left the theater with a ""holy crap...what did I just watch face"". This movie was truly amazing. I firmly believe some people are crapping on it because it is a mirror to how society is right now and that scares people. If this kind of movie isn't your cup of tea that is fine but we have to look at this movie for what it is. This isn't a marvel film, you don't have a ton of action sequences, or jokes every two seconds. I wouldn't really even call this a comic book movie, but it's still really good. What Nolan create with his dark knight trilogy was phenomenal and I know Nolan really tried to take comic book characters and ground them to reality, and to me the dark knight can't be touched, however this was able to bring a comic book character even more down to earth than what Nolan did. There were certain lines and scenes in the Joker that were so real it hurt. I'll break down a couple sections right now, I'm no expert critic by any means but I do enjoy a good movie!Phoenix does an amazing job with this character...I wasn't worried given Phoenix's reputation in the business, but he really blew me out of the water with this one. I thoroughly enjoyed his performance. Phoenix really is the star here and honestly will probably be the only character I really remember from this movie (with good reason obviously lol) A lot of the other characters sorted faded in the background for me with the exception of Murray (SPOILER)(given the fact that Joker shoots him point blank on live television) and Thomas Wayne given the fact that he was just an ass in this movie. Which I don't mind that they did that to his character but the lack of compassion from all these characters was a really hard hit. Zazie Beetz character did display compassion in the apartment scene which honestly I was floored when I finally realized what was going on with her character and Arthur. It was honestly a really good twist in my opinion.The pace of the movie is slow, if you are accustomed to high action movies then you may be disappointed in this and find it to be too slow. I don't mind a slow movie when the storyline engages me and this story line engaged me.Cinematography was beautiful, I don't have much to say here, whoever was in charge of that did a phenomenal job.The dialogue in this movie was really good, as I mentioned above there were certain lines that were said that were honestly so real that it hit like a ton of bricks to me. This movie was really heavy, one of the heaviest parts was when you find out what happens to Arthur when he's a child because of his moms negligence, the abuse and being tied to a radiator...that hit hard and deep. It also was interesting trying to figure out what was real and what was in Arthur's mind throughout the whole movie. It was just really crazy.One of the most disappointing things for me which I knew about before going to see the movie was that you really only see Joker as joker in full makeup and costume for the last 20 minutes of the film, although exhilarating really left me sad that Phoenix does not want to reprise this role. I know this is an origin story, and when I first heard that Joaquin didn't want to reprise this role I was ok with that, I liked the idea of a one and done situation, until I watched the movie! Now I want more! His last 20 minutes as joker was great, the ending of the talk show got me, when he was laughing in the camera, I was sitting there thinking ""that is joker"".All in all this movie was phenomenal, some weak moments but I will definitely be watching it again. The message is clear and concise (not a message on violence!!!!) and everything was done great. Not perfect but everything I needed and wanted it to be. Todd Phillips did great and deserves applause and recognition for this movie!Ps. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not take your children to this movie, as I stated it is very heavy and rated R for a reason. (Obviously do what you want with your child, but I don't think it is necessarily a good idea to expose children to what is in this movie)"
5550,"Joker movie is a great movie. And Joker is a heavy character. So when we see a joker movie or joker character, we have to see the actor's performance first. Phoenix's performance is unique and surely gives the different taste from others' joker. The performance is outstanding and the music flows through the heart. So what do we need more? If you're the one who expected so much from joker movie, it's not your fault. The directing and performance are special. The story is good enough. And this movie gives me special taste of cinema like different and special you know."
5551,"I don't know its just me or some people crying like i do..
I just can feel what you feel arthur..
Nobody want to life like a trash..this movie really bring my emotion.
Such a great movie"
5552,"When I was in the theatre, the guy beside me kept moving his head the same way as the Joker. I think this is best compliment to the director and the actor. He also took pictures of the final scene. I hope he doesn't get too influenced by JP. I have a nagging feeling crimes will increase post the release and that I believe in a way is a homage and a curse at the same time. Giving any rating to the immersive experience this movie provides would be sort of an insult to the effort. Do yourself a favour, watch it with strangers in the theatre and don't forget to watch Meet the Parents trilogy after coming out to get this out of your head."
5553,"They did such a great job making this film, can't describe it.. Just go see the film. Best film of 2019 by far!!"
5554,"Quite simply an outstanding film, I'm no film critic but this is the highlight film of 2019 and the portrayal of The Joker is right up there, if not beyond where the character has been taken before!"
5555,"For the ones who are rating this with 1 star, did you expect a happy lovely story? Come on, this is the freaking Joker. If you can't take it, or this is not your category film, don't watch it!"
5556,"It is a very disturbing movie I left the theater hour ago and still speechless , Phoenix is magnificent , we saw the development of the joker and how Thomas Wayne created joker and joker created batman"
5557,"The character portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix, Arthur Fleck, allows the viewer to deeply understand the frustration and pain carved into the heart of a corrupt and unequal society member, that struggles to be accepted by others because of his distorted view of life. As the movie develops itself through the analysis of a chaotic city and the construction of a melancholic soundtrack, the character praises the need of happiness and to make people laugh, but that desperate need of laughter and joy turns Fleck into something new, the leader of an anarchy that is taken as The Joker."
5558,If you wanted a dark and gritty movie look no further than joker everything about this movie is superb everyone should watch this movie is one of those that leave you thinking in the end
5559,"I have never written a review on IMDb before this and I am inclined to write because this masterful piece of art deserves it. This movie explore the character in such amazing depth that this is the first time I felt actually scared from the Joker. In all the previous attempts, be it games, movies or animations. I've never seen the Joker being portrayed with such vehemence.
This is not a movie for the faint hearted stupid people who feel that this movie encourages violence. It shows the most brilliant account of how a society with no regard of people can create the most"
5560,"Got back a couple of hours ago from the opening performance of Joker at my local Cineworld. I had deliberately avoided reviews but saw this morning that The Guardian had described it as the worst film of the year. If The Guardian hates it then you can be sure the film is going to have something going for it. In this case I was rapt throughout. Joaquin Phoenix's performance was utterly outstanding and if he doesn't win the Oscar for Best Actor then it will be because of some political stitch-up. The movie is slow-paced but confident and self-assured with it. Unlike a couple of reviews I have seen, I personally thought the story-line was very good and I didn't see the plot changes coming except for the police car bit at the end. I should admit to not being a fan or knowledgeable of the superhero genre but have The Dark Knight in my top 10 films of all time. I also thought the cinematography was excellent and loved the soundtrack so stayed until the very last to see the track listings. To summarise, this is an outstanding piece of art which in the fullness of time will, I believe, become a cult classic."
5561,"I can say that i'm really grateful that movies like this one haven't died yet. I waited so long for this movie, wishing not to be bad one. I went to the theater with so much hope because of the reviews here. I finished the movie in completely silence.. i really thought that i should see it again even though it was 2 am. I never really had this kind of feeling since interstellar. It's a masterpiece.. everything excellent and has been done with passion. Thanks Joaquin And Tod for this movie. I'm SPEECHLESS.
It's pure drama my friends just don't miss it go and watch it and put on a happy face, or silent one i could say."
5562,"To me, Joker is always Heath Ledger, I mean, I never hoped (and wanted) anybody to pull the character Joker like him. There were none who could ordain the throne, but Joaquin Phoenix did the finest job. I mean, he was phenomenal! His madness, his sadness, his joker laughter-it's like Joker is someone from our real world and he is it, not Joaquin. The story was to the point, the direction was neat and on top of that, loved the ending! Can't wait to see how the dark knight will rise!
After Nolan' majestic The Dark Knight Trilogy, Joker is my most favorite movie about DC Universe."
5563,Must watch! Another good show by DC after Aqua Man and I would say it is even better! Mr Phoenix totally nailed it and his perfect acting skill definitely deserve Oscar Award. I had emotional feelings after I watched the show. It perfectly potrayed the sorrow and struggle of a depressed person. Looking forward to the battle between Joker and Batman in the upcoming movie.
5564,"Everything in the film to me was amazing. The Cinematography ,soundtrack, story line, and of course the strong acting of the characters, and especially Phoenix's performance that of course steals the show. The soundtrack of the movie was perfect, everything mixed together perfectly. I enjoyed this movie so much, that I ended up making an IMDB account just to rate it. Thank you to everyone involved in this movie."
5565,"Joker is one of the most outstanding dramas of this year, one of the most powerful comic book films ever made, and one of the most amazing actor transformations for a role.Joaquin Phoenix is the perfect casting solution. This actor is incredibly different in each of his roles, Joker is no exception. Perhaps even his the most striking role. He became the real fantastic bird that revived the character from the ashes left after the lost and stupid role of Jared Leto in Suicide Squad.Look forward to 2020 to see Joaquin in the list of Oscar nominees for the Best Actor, to enjoy with the whole world, when he will speak his speech, standing on a stage with a golden statuette in his hands."
5566,"Amazing.an absolute masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix killed it. The darkness made it perfect, overall a good ad for cigarettes."
5567,#crazy movie....dami xa hai kta haru go and watch in theatre
5568,"Todds's portrial of the joker is the best one in all forms of media whether it be comics movies games or tv, Nothing compares to the realisim and amazing writing and directing on this joker. And Joaquin's performance was more than Oscar worthy;his acting feels so real that i forgot it was a movie and he was an actor. The 2 hours went by without me noticing.Overall this movie is a must watch for casual movie watchers, dc diehard fans and everyone else in between"
5569,"Everything about this movie is perfect imo. Phoenix killed the role his performance is so tense and draining to watch its spectacular. This movie is a tense, dramatic, emotional draining movie that grabs you and doesn't let go even after the credits role"
5570,WI and again come again I'm and I'm sorry pretty much please please
5571,"I went in with mid level expectations, but even with high with expectations, I still feel like this movie would have exceeded them. It was great across the board; direction, cinematography, screen play and a really masterful performance by the main actor. Very impressed and inspiring as a example of artful yet accessible filmmaking."
5572,"I've waited a very long time to see and review this film. Let me start off I understand the controversy around this film. This is a very intense, dark film for mature audiences. It gives you a very deep and dark look into the mind of a mentally ill man who is rejected by society and becomes a homicidal villain. Joaquin Pheonix, who in my opinion gave the greatest performance I've seen in a very, very long time, brought the Joker to life. It is so hard to word how I feel after walking out of this film. The way Joaquin portrayed this character just left me speechless. I actually was uncomfortable at moments. Without giving anything away to the plot, Joker was rollercoaster that gave me a different perspective on comic book films. The acting was absolutely amazing, the score was just WOW! Whoever composed it definitely deserves recognition. I DO NOT I repeat DO NOT believe this movie is suited for immature audiences and believe parents should not let their kids see this film until they have a mature mindset. To me this film was one of the greatest films ive seen and has entered my top 10 list. Not sure exactly where it stands yet but it is in that list for sure."
5573,"The way the characters and the city of Gotham plays out jokers psychology is just beautiful, and then there is Joaquin. Don't forget to smile"
5574,"When you think of a graphic novel featuring the Joker, this movie is what you would get. Wonderful performance by Joaquin. Stylistic and complimentary to the DC mythos.A unique story and a unique performance. A great movie for the ages! Go see it."
5575,"HOLY SNIKEES BATMAN! NO SPOILERS
This is not the movie you are expecting to see. This is not the Harley Quinn and Joker...Joker! This movie is serious. This movie is deep. And, this movie is disturbing. Yes, Joaquin get's his Academy Award.
This is one of the most brilliant movies that should have never been made. Especially with the tension in the country. Especially right before Halloween. SOMEONE, SOMEWHERE, AT SOME TIME WILL DIE BECAUSE OF THIS MOVIE. Oh for most it will go over their heads, but, for some... For a few, it will ignite a pilot light inside of them. This is the type of movie that causes school shootings.
If you are not a spiritual person then you may not have experienced first hand or even believe in good or evil. This movie is a celebration of anarchy. The world is about to be introduced to EVIL GENUIS in a way like never before."
5576,"I loved this movie! It was VERY DARK. But with that being said, it was very good! Entertaining from start to finish!"
5577,"This film is freakin fantastic. Before seeing the movie I just expected it to be a pretty decent movie but I'm just in shock about what I just saw. If you want your jaw to drop and your heart to race you have to see this film. Such fantastic acting from Joaquin, you actually believe he's the real life joker."
5578,"A darker more grounded and realistic take on the joker and Gotham really allow the viewer to become entangled in the narrative and truly feel like they have entered the world. Amazing storytelling that really draws you in from the beginning right to the very last minutes. Amazing movie, acting and writing. Gave an amazing insight into what the people of Gotham face. Joaquin was absolutely amazing and definitely one of, if not the best example of the Joker so far. His take on the Joker is very different then what we've seen before but in such great ways. Infact his portrayal of the Joker is definitely deserving of an oscar. Best movie I've seen in a long time and probably the best I'll see in a long time in today's crazy climate. It's my favorite movie of the year so far and I'd say absolutely a must see!"
5579,"I did not expect much when I watch a DC movie but this movie is in the league of the likes of Logan, Batman Trilogy. Joaquin Phoenix, wow, he did not left a lot of impression on me in his past movies but I heard most of the movies he participated won Oscar, this guy must have a knack for spotting good one, especially one that helps him showcase his acting. I left the theater crying after Joker's laugh, he keeps laughing but I don't know why there's such a sad feeling. Who could have portrayed a better Joker than this. 10/10"
5580,"For those of you looking for a dark comic book tale, this isn't it. When you go into this film don't look at it as the story of a famous comic book villain. Look at it as a story about a man dealing with mental illness in a troubling time. Joaquin Phoenix gives the performance of a lifetime and there are a number of times the movie will leave your jaw on the floor. This is a must watch, but if you are looking for a typical feel good happy comic book story then this isn't the movie for you"
5581,"This movie is without a doubt the BEST movie of the year and I'm not exaggerating here. Every single performance is amazing and Joaquin Phoenix? BIG OOFF. Mano I swear that if he isn't nominated for an Oscar for this role, I'm losing my crap :DThe movie was beautifully filmed and it had a really noir vibe to it (akin to Taxi Driver from Martin Scorcese). It made it all the more gritty and intense.Joaquin Phoenix absolutely MURDERS (no pun intended ksjksjksj) this role. It is in no way similiar to Heath Ledger's performance. This is his own take on the Joker and a damn good one at that. You see how he slowly becomes more and more unhinged to the point of no return and it's honestly riveting/scary to watch. This movie does not ask you to sympathize with him but more like understand him and although many of the things he does (I'll mention that in a bit) are violent and genuinely shocking, you can understand his motivations on why he's doing what he did. It's more of a love/hate thing with him and trust me it's amazing.Now, I want to clarify that this movie is definitely NOT for kids. In no way is it an action movie, it's a character study and social analysis told in a deeply disturbing/violent way. So I repeat, do NOT take your kids to this movie. Also, while alot of early critics made it seem like the movie's a huge bloodbath, it ain't. The violence is quite infrequent but when there is, trust me it is apparent and definitely gives it the hard 'R' rating. It's mainly rated 'R' due to it's deep, intense psychological structure.Guys fr when you have the chance, go watch the movie. It's a definite must-see and hands down movie of the year10/10❤"
5582,"Don't let anyone confuse you, this is an incredibly disturbing film, and it knows it. Watching Joaquin Phoenix's descent into madness is incredibly uncomfortable, but incredibly well done.Phoenix shines the brightest in a great cast. Down to the smallest mannerisms, Phoenix transforms himself into Arthur, a man that cant catch a break, and is hitting his boiling point. With an already spellbinding resumé, this very well may be my favorite Phoenix role.All in all, Todd Phillips has done a complete career-180 here and presents us with one of 2019's greatest achievements."
5583,"Realy thats something we not every year
Joker give you the best drama performance on the last 5 year"
5584,"This movie is absurd. Very well directed and shot. Extremely disturbing, bit very interesting. It may not be the movie this society deserves, but it's the one it needs right now."
5585,I don't have the words in my vocabulary to describe the perfection that is this movie. Phoenix has mastered every aspect of the Joker and Phillips' direction was mesmerizing.
5586,"You know that moment when you have so much to say, but no words to say what you need to say? You feel the emotions running through your limbs at a rate that's faster than you can handle, so you lose your balance. You try to stand tall, and gather your thoughts, but your legs go limp, and your body grows weak. ""I need a moment""... that's what he said, as we drove home in the silence of the rain, contemplating the moment that we just shared."
5587,"When you think about Heath ledger... you sometimes wonder how he got into this chaotic state. ""The killing joke"" tried to answer it but this was altogether a new feeling. You feel for Joaquin phoenix but at the same time you don't comply with his behaviors. This is not the same joker that you saw earlier, you pity him, you cry and laugh with him. The acting and BGM standout and make it No. 1 nomination for Oscar this year. and critics who are saying that this movie will have bad influence on the society..."
5588,I watched Alitalia of this movie with my mouth open in awe.
5589,"Oh yeah, it's good. As a psychological study, it's a tad Hollywood, but as a comic book movie, it's something very unique indeed.
Probably the least surprising thing about the movie is Joaquin Pheonix's performance as Arthur Fleck; given his immaculate, decade long streak of complex, damaged characters.
But it would be a disservice to not praise what is quintessentially a make or break the movie role that Phoenix devours with every ounce of talent he possess. It is amazing!
But the real left field surprise comes from director Todd Phillips (most notable for the Hangover trilogy), who continues what has become something of trend for bad comedy directors (among them Peter Farrelly's Green Book and Craig Mazin's Chernobyl). Dishing out mature, genuinely affecting character dramas seemingly, from out of nowhere."
5590,"There is nothing more delightful than an orchastreted chaos!Phoenix presents us a man who hasn't really existed for his whole life. The awfulness is a routine, as the happiness is completely absent, nonexperienced.Thereby, we are forced to witness nothing but misery, due to an A. Fleck struggling to mitigate his own nature: the comedy within the artist.When the one is finally able to give birth to himself, there are no more barriers to push him back. The society is no longer capable to disregard a man it no longer owns.Put on a happy face...and enjoy a hilarious psycopath in his full glory.That's all. That's life."
5591,"I think it's disappointing that people are upset with this movie. This is who Joker is. A maniac. There was no true origin story before in the comics but Phillips did a way better job than what Tim Burton did. It was more realistic that he already had a condition where he couldn't control his laughter and became an outcast in society. It's way better than falling in green liquid for crying out loud. Ledger is good but has no origin story whatsoever which is disappointing. This Joker was truly insane. Ledger and Nicholson were rational and crazy.Phoenix was crazy to the bone. Phoenix created the best story of what DC wanted Joker to be, a maniac with no empathy. In the comics he doesn't have empathy for anybody.People who haven't read the comics are misinformed about who truly Joker is. A maniac who doesn't care about killing innocent people and wants to watch the world burn. I was waiting for this version of Joker to come out and boy did it not disappoint. Hats off to Todd Phillips and Joaqin Phoenix. This deserves an Oscar."
5592,"I had high expectations of this movie starring Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck who is drifting downward into a maniacal spiral as society's reject.
Struggling with a mental disorder and his lovely mother they are trying to get by in daily harsh cold life in Gotham City.This movie is the perfect prequel as to whom created multimillionaires son Bruce Wayne Batman & The dark knight series, we all love & hate so much.Joker portraits the nature of good trying to fight of chaos within a dark insane plot twist.
Turning a sad lonely man making money as a clown for a living into a raging villain transforming into a stand-out-of-the-crowd unordinary ""anti hero"".
Giving you insight in a deeply knitted physiological character background and perfectly seamless story telling envelope.I'm giving this movie a 10/10 for outstanding acting.
Realistic emotional screenplay by all the cast and great support play by Robert the Niro.
Nostalgic seamless Soundtrack & Sound FX.
Perfect directing with a great POV and 3th person feel to it.
Gloomy 80's feel as city's delve deeper into chaos.PS: Comparing this with Heath Ledgers version would be unfair. They are totally different type's of lunacy. And the type of Lunacy they represent is both equally great. Not to forget, Ledger was a support act, Phoenix is the main act.""Dive into the skin of Gotham's most feared super villain.""Enjoy it while u can!!! (*Hysterical laughter..........)"
5593,Dark and dramatic. I have loved some of Joaquin Phoenix movies in the past this one is Stellar. He turned into the Joker and owned the role. I think this is one of the best performances of his career. Oscar-worthy
5594,"I have never written a review for iMDB before, but this film made writing one necessary. This is one of the most intelligent, raw, and eye-opening movies I've ever seen. Though dark, brooding, and gory, every decision made by Phillips in this film was necessary. This film serves as a mirror to society and tackles controversial, relevant topics that need the spotlight, especially mental health. Phoenix's performance was one of the best I've seen in a long time, taking the cake over Ledger in my opinion. I loved seeing a new take on the comic-book genre. This film is a MASTERPIECE."
5595,"Alright, forget about the hype and remember that this joker is not from the comic. This is the journey of Arthur becoming joker in a very realistic world, may be too realistic sometimes. The two constants in the movie are Joaquin and Hildur (music) and they have done brilliantly. The convincing writing conveys how a so-called normal, moral guy can change into a monster. The laugh, walk, the foot tapping, the stairs, the elevator and other detailing in every frame is very effective. Although, I felt suffocating at times as I never really got into the movie's rhythm. Brilliant movie to watch in the theaters with Hildur's music. Although, if you listen carefully you can hear Hans Zimmer!"
5596,"Performance rating: 10/10, Joaquin PhoenixNotes: Intense social commentary, veins of anarchism, ""seeing through the veil,"" struggle, social isolation, bitterness, rage, emotional deregulationEmotion: Raw, humanScore: 9.5/10 (will post an aged score later, perhaps)Why you should watch it:1. You suffer from mental health problems and ""making it"" in modern society2. You want to cry3. You want to understand an aspect of the human condition4. You like social commentaryStream of consciousness review:I cried several times during this movie. I cried for the brutality of humanity and the depth of suffering we can experience at the hands of one another. I cried for Arthur. I cried for myself because in him I could see a frightened child, one which I still have. I cried because it was all too real, too accurate, too brutal. The violence was not in any sort of murder; rather, the violence was a mental one.Joaquin brought to life the tenderness of the open wound that is the human condition. One could view the entire thing as ""trying too hard"" but I did not go in with a cynical mind. And I'm sure glad I didn't because if I were cynical about everything I would hate everything. The commentary of a generation, the suffering. Feeling out of place in a world that moves too fast. You stop and smell the roses, and someone, out of spite, cuts your roses up and poisons the well. This may seem an extreme assertion on the surface but take a moment to think about times you have exposed your heart of hearts, to have it degraded, or worse, dismissed.The human condition is something we should start taking seriously again, because we are losing our humanity. We are losing our soul. I found it fascinating, the ""jokers"" running around, and then for this piece to come out, to address the shredded chord, the perforated vein running through all these folks. It is a dangerous slope, and we joke and ridicule those who would have something to say about it, but I believe this is out of fear. I understand that fear."
5597,"Amazing movie, sign me up for a sequel. There have been too many great marvel movies and joker is one of the movies that can top that."
5598,Very good interpretation... very good movie. good enough to write my first review. batman fan... need to see this movie. joker makes you very uncomfortable
5599,"The story , acting .. everything was just so perfect. Crazy good. I haven't seen such an amazing piece of art like this in awhile."
5600,"Amazing movie. Joaquin Phoenix went above and beyond with his interpretation. The music, the cinematography, well, everything gets you so involved in the storyline."
5601,"In all my years as a cinephile, I can´t remember the last time I watched a masterpiece like this. Or even better, I can´t remember the last time I saw a performance like Joaquin Phoenix gives us in here: So dark, so atractive, so twisted, so magnificent, so Oscar worthy. I´ve seen all his movies, but this performance is above many others. This film is amazing, but HE is the one who makes it so incredible. This performance will change the cinema history, and will be remembered forever. Jesus, I don´t have other words to describe him, but If you don´t give the award to him, Academy, we will send in the clowns..."
5602,Ever character and scene was on par with the best of the best. The twists and turns of the film sent chills down my spine. AWESOME MOVIE!
5603,To say this movie is a Masterpiece would be an understatement. You go on this journey from start to finish and watch the birth of such an iconic character. This movie is the new standard in how I rate movies from here on. Highly recommend it!
5604,"This was an absolute master class in both the direction showcased by Todd Philips and the character portrayal by Joaquin Phoenix. The combination of the 2 creates a feeling of unease throughout the film, an eery tension which grows amidst Arthur Fleck's furthering decent into madness. The commitment to the role by Phoenix is absolutely astounding, he both physically and mentally contorts himself into a mold of a man that is slowly losing his grip on reality. I've never felt so compelled to cheer for a character who I know to be irredeemable, albeit worthy of some sympathy. You know what you get when you trust Todd Philips and Joaquin Phoenix to fulfill the hype for an R rated joker origin film? Exactly what you paid for! This is the best film of the year and my front runner for Best Director and Best Male Lead. A much deserved 10/10. Bravo 👏🏼"
5605,Joaquim Phoenix did an incredible job. It was mind blowing how well he played this role. The film really blew my mind.It wasn't a super hero movie with lots of action but it blew your mind with how this man becomes the joker. Well worth it.
5606,"It's a masterspiece. This movie has it all, the confusion, drama, love, action, mystery, it drives you crazy and emotionally involved. Also such a great cinematography with beautiful composition of colors, great directing from Todd and the acting of Joaquin is speechless, impressive and outstanding. This is the Joker that we needed, it's just simply perfect."
5607,"It is not a superhero film, it is a film about a man based on comic books. It is not just a film, it is a character exploration, a true piece of art. And there is no right or wrong in art, it is how you interpreted it. Rare to see such king of film nowadays. Highly influenced by Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver, Arthur reminds me of Travis but he is misdirected, worse and moe terrifying. Joaquin Phoenix was astonishing. The they make Gotham was unique, more realistic, cinematography was outstanding. To be honest, I had a doubt Todd Phillips could make such kind of film but he nailed it, maybe this is the best of his career. The whole build up was so good and the final scene was goosebumps. Easily the best movie of this year."
5608,"I often go to see superhero or villian movies. But today I went to see the joker thinking that was the typical movie with a sad villain with family problems and stuff like that, but no, I GOT AMAZED it was spectacular, the acting of Phoenix got me disturbed, it was incredible, I believe it is worth an Oscar and the movie itself was unbelievable, I couldn't stare away from the screen , I never knew what was going to happened and it kept me nervous an exited. 10/10"
5609,This truly was a perfect film. Joaquin Phoenix takes the audience on a journey into madness. Phoenix puts on one of the best performances I've ever seen in movie history. It really felt like you were witnessing a man go insane. I had high expectations for this and it did not disappoint!
5610,"Disturbing. Twisted. Real. I can't even begin to describe what a masterpiece this film was. The colors and the cinematography were incredible. Notice how his world is colorful and happy when he becomes ""Joker"". Joaquin deserves an Oscar nomination for this performance (definitely a Golden Oscar). Todd Phillips and Phoenix made the character seem so believable; showing how society can change someone. I'm seeing it again tomorrow for sure!"
5611,"I thought it was great alternate story for the ""Joker"". It dealt with hard issues and did very well present thing to the audience in a real way. I think this story showcased the basis of the Joker character and who he is, but also put him in a more real place, as in what he may look like if he really existed. Great Job. Great performance by Joaquin Phoenix, and a Great Story/Plot."
5612,O have No words to describe how perfect the film is !
5613,"Its very dark, gritty and brutal. Even the funny scenes in the movie are during it's most violent scenes and you will have to laugh while feeling guilt.
Joaquin Phoenix has given an outstanding justice to the role.
It will make you sympathize with Arthur and you will feel a little bit guilty about it( any sane person should).
A perfect Joker origin movie. Hats off to Todd."
5614,This movie was amazing. You know you've seen a great movie when you know you'll be thinking about the entire story days after you've viewed it. That's exactly what this movie will do. You will be blown away with the depth of the mentality this character has in this study. Do yourself a favor and stop reading the reviews and go watch it.
5615,Joaquin Phoenix killed it as the Joker. The biggest thing that I felt while watching this movie was the unsettling atmosphere. The ending was terrific and the movie had an overall great pace!
5616,"Watching the trailer 10 times before the movie, I thought that I knew the whole story, but the view has many surprises, with an insane performance of Joaquin, with a wonderfull script that make you fly into the jokers madness, but in a way that was never seen before.
Movie of the year"
5617,Fantastic movie. It's an origin story so if you are expecting Heath Ledger's ready to go Joker it is not that. Joaquin Phoenix is spellbinding. You can't take your eyes off him. Story is original with lots of twists and turns. Give Phoenix the Oscar now.
5618,"What a performance!!!!!! Please sign Joakin for a sequel.
His performace, his movements, his reactions OMG..... He took the role to a next level. We though we are watching a movie from an old era. his adoption!!!!!!
If this doen't give him the Oscar the what????A unique joker permormance. Nowhere close to what was seen before.Whach the movie, you will not disapointed."
5619,"Oh my god! What a movie
What a mind blowing performance by Joaquin Phoenix..
👌🏻👌🏻 His transformation from an innocent person who just wants to make ppl happy to the king of thugs will definitely blow ur mind away!
Must watch!!"
5620,"This movie feels like in the universe of Scarface rather than the city of Batman.If you ever wondered how a movie on the comic's universe would look if filmed in the most realistic way, this is the answer, and this is why this movie belongs to the podium of most notable movies ever made.Most villains in movies are just caricatures of a bad man who is bad just because, or they have just checkbox reasons to be villain, but it never goes deeper.Here is a complex character with meat to him. He has multiple motives to become the Joker, but none is the entire story. It is the set of circumstances, as it is in the real world. He is not entirely evil, not entirely insane. A victim and victimary, just as it happens in the dog eats dog, real world."
5621,"It's obvious that pheonix is also insane, you would have to be to pull off what I just watched. Wow"
5622,"As other reviews here have stated this is not your regular superhero action-thriller flick but a gritty character study. Joaquin Phoenix has done an absolutely tremendous job here..from his painful laugh that must have been exhausting to do to his slow dissent into complete madness which unearths how truly broken Arthur is really an incredible feat..You truly feel that he is coming unhinged which just goes to show what an incredible actor Joaquin is and the effort he put into this.. The ending
makes you question certain events and willl leave you discussing this movie for months.. Watch it its a masterpiece!"
5623,I will be very disappointed if Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get nominated for an academy award and wins as best actor.
5624,"If you're just not a fan of the movie I understand. But these critics are giving the dumbest reasons to why it's not a good movie because it's so ""controversial"" haha soft as hell"
5625,"Cold, hard and sharp; The film does absolute justice to Ledger's performance. Joker is a film that does not confine itself to the normal comic book genre. It is a character study, giving us an insight to how Arthur turns into the iconic villain Joker that we all love to hate. It takes us to back to 1980s Gotham City which is shown struggling due to massive segregation, crimes and disparity of wealth. With the unfortunate parts of society already on edge, it could just take one little spark to cause a big boom.
Joker makes the viewer some what sympathetic towards the character. And also forces the viewers to think what role do we play in creating such monsters. Joaquin Phoenix carries the whole movie on his shoulders and delivers, which many are calling, an Oscar worthy performance. His performance may send chills down spines for some viewers.
Bottom line is that this is exactly how such a complex character should have been handled and is the perfect origin story that Joker deserved."
5626,"Don't go into this movie expecting the joker, it's about a man becoming the joker. This movie is really good. Joaquin Phoenix is the joker"
5627,"This portrayal of the character is amazing it shows how Arthur is really broken really messed up and despite all of that he finds joy in destruction, chaos, and himself...he simply is the joker. As he said in the movie I used to think that my life is a tragedy but now I realize, it's a comedy.One hell of a dark twisted comedy"
5628,"Holy crap! I can't believe what I just watched. The Joker starring Joaquin Phoenix and Robert De Niro is a telling not from the comic books, but how Arthur Flack became the Joker. This movie is simply amazing to watch. Joaquin Phoenix gives a Oscar winning performance. He commanded the screen. This movie is very dark and unlike I've ever seen. The graphic scenes are graphic. But it doesn't happen till close to the climax . There are shocking moments and it will you gasping. The movie is slow in the beginning but it picks up each and every moment. Now the debate will be after watching this movie. Who was the best Joker? Heath Ledger or Joaquin Phoenix? I'll post that later on. People have said that this movie is not for kids? Well most of it is, the rest it is not. Go enjoy this wonderful, beautiful movie. My rating of this movie is 10/10. #thejokermovie #joaquinphoenix #robertdeniro #dcuniverse"
5629,AMAZING! One of 1000 movies to watch before you die!(i guess they have to update their list)
5630,"This was disturbingly a cinematic masterpiece, unforgettable and definitely without a doubt a great movie. I'm highly satisfied with the actors, soundtracks, beautiful visuals, and amazing plots and character developments. This should go down in cinematic series and will definitely be one of my favourite movies of all time."
5631,Words cannot describe how incredible this film is. At the end of the movie everyone started to applause. This does not usually happen. If you are reading this; stop wasting your time and go book yourself a ticket right now! You will definitely not regret it!
5632,"I watch a lot of movies because I have a membership at the local cinema, but It's been a long time since I had such a great time watching a movie!"
5633,"Oscar deserving performance, one of the best acts of 2019. Bravo to Joaquin Phoenix for outsanding performance."
5634,A story of one of the clowns here on this planet shown to you with great direction and acting.
5635,"I got very hyped from the beginning till the end when the teaser and trailer dropped for this wonderful movie. And boy, all the hyping was worth it. It is defenitly not an average superhero/villian movie and I got a feeling a lot of audience excepted this exactly what it would be. Personally I think the Joker movie is on some whole new level. Too me it's pure art. The acting, the shots and music created a constant tense feeling. I felt really uncomfortable at the beginning which is a good thing, becauce that's the exact feeling you should get from the Joker. And that's what I meant, mentioning the audience in the theater I was visiting earlier. A lot of people started laughing because they got akward and if that's the effect in a theatre by your acting skills you can say you've done a really, really good job. It's harsh, i'ts raw and you don't know if you should laugh or cry. I got soaked in it from the beginning till the end and I think that everybody who loves the character of the Joker should see this because you'll open your arms and embrace this movie. And if you did, it will get too you and won't let you go for a while."
5636,"A Dark Story, Outstanding Performances, Background Music, and what not! Joker is a complete package for anyone who wants to experience a complete Dark movie. So put on your happy face and watch this masterpiece."
5637,"Performance is definitely very good, this joker is not crazy in a cult god way, but crazy in a very representative way. I like how they process the delusion and reality parts, and I still don't know if joker is the son of Thomas Wayne😂. The atmosphere in the former part is not catchy enough, wish the music can be more bizarre and perhaps more first person photography could be used. The depth if the movie is a bit too easy to find, but it's still deep."
5638,"Just saw the #Joker last night in Bahrain and it sent chills down my spine . I think this is a one of a kind movie , something that should be experienced by all movie lovers . A slow burn into reality which is far more haunting than fiction.It is not a Superhero movie nope .... it is a super villain movie .An honest reflection of how we are all responsible in creating monsters .Simply a masterpiece . Oscars ... yes for sure."
5639,"An engaging movie, Joaquin Phoenix plays a magnificent role and appears in almost every scene of the movie doing a great job! Pay close attention as one event leads to another, which results in a very good movie."
5640,"The director Todd Phillips himself admits that the story sort of picks elements from various comic book versions of the Joker, but doesn't stick to any one of it entirely. The world of the movie is a DC version of the Scorsese world of: Taxi Driver, King of Comedy and Raging Bull - and Sidney Lumet's: Network, Dog Day Afternoon and Prince of The City. That's one of the reason the film feels so chilling - it's not the Nolan-like plotting, heroic antagonism brought in by the one-liners delivered by Heath Ledger, or the mythical vibe brought in by the superhero Batman. The film centres around the grim, gory, hyperreal world-building and character-disintegration that's so on your face! Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix pull it off masterfully in this nerve-racking cinematic experience called Joker.There is a lot of buzz about the social and moral implications of the film, and to be honest, if you pay your movie tickets for a film titled Joker, I am pretty sure to safely assume you are not in there for moral or sociological implications of it for either you or for anyone else! So stop right there! Because the movie ain't gonna be sweet! Now that we are done with that - Send in the Clowns!Don't miss this movie if your are a Joker fan! It's a must watch!"
5641,"The movie shows you what were the circumstances behind the creation of joker .
What changed him. But viewers will definitely feel the pain of Arthur as the story continues . Do not compare Joaquin Phoenix's joker to heath ledger's joker . Both of them are masterpieces and show two completely different phases of joker."
5642,Very good very good very good very goodry good very good very food very good very good
5643,"I can't believe this movie exists.
If somebody told me a couple of months ago that Todd Phillips' ""Joker"" would actually be a personal drama that acts as a character study and social commentary while also making sure to be a film striped away from the Hollywood standards and stuff that most movies of the genre incorporate in addition to being exceptionally written, directed, acted and scored, I genuinely wouldn't believe him. This movie reminds me of two eras, the first one being the good old days of American cinema. It's obviously inspired from that period of filmmaking and I think it's needless to say how Martin Scorsese's filmography (most notably ""Taxi Driver"") has contributed to this movie actually being made. The second period of time ""Joker"" reminds of, are the 2000s when comic-book movies completely knocked it out of the park with Sam Raimi's Spiderman and Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogies setting the example of how to make a perfect comic-book movie if not a perfect movie in general. After that period was over, comic-book movies just became commercials for other movies, as the MCU and other studios trying to replicate its financial success, started making superhero movies for the sake of crossovers, sequels and...money. A movie wasn't a movie with beginning middle and end but a rather forgettable pop-corn flick that simply lacked a certain vision or quality. And then came ""Joker"". A movie that reminded me that movies based on comic-books can actually be relatable, visionary, groundbreaking and whole stories again. With all that being said I'd really like to wrap up the technical aspects of the film in order to get into spoiler territory. So, besides the amazing direction, brilliant writing, Joaquin Phoenix's Oscar worthy performance, the extremely suitable/haunting score and staggering cinematography that actually made me feel I was watching a movie shot in the 80ies, there's really nothing else to be told.
The movie is what we were promised...a character study. It truly stands by that. The camera stays with our protagonist for the entire runtime as we witness his transformation from a struggling everyday citizen to a vengeful murdering psychopath that despite the cruelty he displays in some scenes, he still has retained some of his human character traits unlike Heath Ledger's Joker who was more like a force of nature with no background or particular motivation in order for us to figure out what he was truly after. The movie opens with Arthur Fleck (our Joker) as he is bullied at work by a bunch of teenagers who harass and eventually beat him as he lays helpless on the pavement. We later see him at a psychiatrist's office where we actually understand what this man is going through, as he is tortured by an unknown disease that causes him pathological laughter when he is uncomfortable, disturbed or sad. The movie shows us this man's pain from the start as we learn that he's been a patient of some sort of asylum in the past and currently has to take 7 different medications a day in order to cope with his depression and mental illness. Phoenix does his absolute best to demonstrate Arthur's pain with the pathological laughter being chilling and masterful. I really bought the fact he was actually in pain while laughing his ass off. This condition is of great importance as it's an additional reason (maybe the most important one) for which the people that surround Fleck label him as a freak in addition to being one of the movie's most important plot points. He lives with his mother whom he cares for and dreams of becoming a stand-up comedian with his idol being Robert Deniro's character who plays one of America's most famous comedians and talk show hosts. Arthur is set up as an unreliable narrator from the beginning where he imagines himself to be on Murray's (Deniro) show with various subplots and scenes also being questionable, the most obvious example being his relationship with Zazie Beetz's character, Sophie who the movie implies he eventually kills for reasons that make perfect sense all things considered. The big twist is that his nonexistent father, up until that point is actually Thomas Wayne who currently runs for mayor. This adds a completely different layer to the story as Arthur is forced on a journey to meet his father. Thomas Wayne denies everything and reveals to Arthur that his mother is insane which leads him to discovering the truth about her who adopted him and at some point had allowed one of her boyfriends to abuse him which caused his mental illness and pathological laughter condition. This pushes him over the edge as he goes full Joker killing his mother which is the reason he also killed Sophie (Beetsz) who (as a single parent) would have most likely done a very bad job at raising her daughter in this gritty/cruel society, similarly to how his mother (who he now perceives as a villain) did. At last, he joins Murray's talk show after Murray himself released footage of Arthur trying to shine as a stand-up comedian, embarrassing himself in the process due to his laughing condition which leads to the movie's climactic outburst which truly is one of the best third acts I've seen in a movie due to the story perfectly building to it. The end didn't quite stuck with me at first but after considering it, I think it's implied that Fleck has been in that psychiatric ward, dreaming or narrating the events of the film to the psychiatrist with an early shot at the opening of the movie (where we briefly see Arthur busting his head on the door of a similar psychiatric ward wearing similar clothes) seemingly confirming that he might as well have been there all along (plus in both scenes he's talking to a psychiatrist so there is a thematic connection). Does this mean the events of the film didn't happen exactly the way we were shown or are they completely imagined by Fleck? I don't know but the movie is definitely setting itself up to be ambiguous since there are hints suggesting Arthur being adopted and abused by his mother's boyfriends could be lies as there is a scene in which Arthur picks up a photo of his young mother that Thomas Wayne had given to her signing ""Love your Smile"" on the background of the photo, implying a potential romantic relationship between them. Eventually, that is one of the things I love about this movie...the ambiguity. Did his mother adopt him and allowed his abuse or is Thomas Wayne really his father using his connections and power to cover it up? Have the events of the movie truly happened this way or are they completely imagined? I think Todd Phillips isn't going to share his thoughts on his true intentions any time soon and if you ask me...I rather never learn the truth.
All and all, ""Joker"" is pretty much like ""The Dark Knight"" in terms of how you take a movie based on comic-book characters and turn it into a genre movie that is as realistic as it is relatable. I'd also go as far as to say ""Joker"" is the exact opposite of ""V for Vendetta"" with both movies being two sides of the same coin. They're both standalone films with beginning middle and end as the main theme circles around the fascistic face of power and authority. ""V for Vendetta"" however, is a movie set in a futuristic, dystopian society that ends up having a hopeful and optimistic tone while ""Joker"" is a movie set in the filthy, overpopulated streets of a realistic past that ends up having a very depressing and pessimistic tone. As for the violence, the movie is not like most controversial movies (Fight Club, American Psycho, A Clockwork Orange etc.) that portray violence in a satirical way that sometimes is disturbingly cool. It is never satirical and it portrays violence as it is. It's not meant to be funny or cool by any means and the film is more of a warning for society that creates ""Jokers"" and less of an approval of its violence (it's actually not an approval at all). I think I've said anything I could. Clearly there are many things I didn't cover here as the movie respects itself enough to be complex and multilayered. As an enormous Batman fan and even more a movie fan, 2019's ""Joker"" has proven to be one of the best experiences I've ever had in a movie theater and I'm pretty sure this film is going down the road of becoming a classic.
EXCEPTIONAL: 9/10"
5644,"When I started watching Joker, I feared I might compare Joaquin Phoenix with Heath Ledger. I partially knew my fear was baseless, but Joaquin convinced me beyond doubt that he is the Joker. What Heath played is unforgettable and Phoenix took the cariacature to a different level altogether. The midget scene was beautifully delivered giving me a laugh creepily for the sheer situation they created. The script is painfully detailed to a maddening level. The transformation is phenomenal. One understands Joker's madness and perhaps starts to see a certain sympathy beget inside to see him kill in his pain. An almost urge to see him create havoc. That was the power of the portrayal. Do not miss!!"
5645,"For the first time in years, I clapped at the end of a movie.
What an actor! What a story! What an epic movie!
The movie got so much hype that I was afraid I raised the bar too high while entering the cinema.
In the end, it was a ten ton slap in the face that I received with a big smile.
What a masterpiece!"
5646,"I want people to watch this film. Why? Because Hollywood is ruled by money, not art.
I want this film to succeed so we can have more films like this, instead of ONLY getting dumb eye-candy ALL THE TIME.
I enjoy those dumb superhero movies, I do! I really liked the last 2 Avengers movies, they are lots of fun! But I also like Burger King once in a while, and McDonald's as well, and yet I'm convinced I would die an early death if I were to eat ONLY junk food.
We should have a 70/30 ratio of films/movies, but instead we have a 2/98 ratio right now! What's wrong with this society!?
I watched JOKER last night and almost cried laughing at the revelation that the art of film is not yet dead.
You will hear lots of childish voices telling you that it is {insert a plethora of negative adjectives here}, but that will come from people with an agenda to make you mind-diabetic with junk movies, and mind-enslaved with woke ideas.
Gotham got the hero they needed in The Dark Knight, but JOKER is giving us the film we need right now.
Please support this work of art. Praise Joaquin Phoenix, and praise Todd Phillips, Scott Silver, Hildur Guðnadóttir, and Lawrence Sher.
Now going to the movies makes more ""cents""."
5647,Joaqin Phoenix proved himself again.it was shocking and touching film.Mental ilness is subjected greatly.Amazing adult drama
5648,"I was left speechless after watching this movie! I felt devastated for the Joker! You cannot help but feel a lot of empathy for what happened to him that lead him to become a Villain! This portrayal of the Joker is by far the best and quite Epic! This movie will definitely win a lot of Oscars, starting with best Actor! I can't wait to watch it again! A must watch for all audiences!"
5649,"I walk into the movie thinking I would hate it , but it was great.The only minor issue I had with the movie is the cliche scenes at the start of the movie where he is Beaten up for no good reason.Shout out for a great cinematography ( it better win an Oscar ) & the great song selection."
5650,"This is no ordinary movie, it's a symphony of direction, production, casting, music, acting, all coming together to make one truly amazing cinematic experience. This movie is an EXPERIENCE and should not fall victim to opinions. It's great to have an opinion, just not when you don't know what you're talking about at all. Please do not listen to people who say this movie is bad, just because they don't know what movies are supposed to be like, or because they went in expecting to watch an Avengersesque fest.
This is one of the best movies ever made."
5651,Watched it today in india and its released during Holidays in my state. Theatre was full. Connecting dots at the ending ofnthe movie was very good. Joaquin Phoenix Deserve Oscar.
5652,"As a bias Heath Ledger fan, and fellow Aussie. I had extreme high expectations of this film. But can honestly say those expectations were well and truly succeeded. This movie was executed so freaking spectacularly, I actually am lost for words. Joaquin is one of my all time favorite actors and this film just blew me mind. I'm shocked and honestly gob smacked at the performance. The plot line, so many twists and unexpected turns. Not to mention, as a long time comic book reader, the adaptation of the comic book Joker was outstanding. So different, yet exactly what the Joker is.
Best movie I have seen. Hands down. No joke. Pun intended."
5653,"I have to admit that this is DC's one of the best work so far if not the best, brilliant direction, one of the finest peice of acting and this movie is darker than the dark knight it was obvious to compare this performance with the one done by heath ledger but i must say that Joaquin Phoenix was up there too.It took a little bit to build up the story but the second half was on another level
I'll rate the first half 9.2 but the second half was easily a 9.8 or higher all in all it was a thought provoking movie and everyone will enjoy it.👍😍"
5654,"This is my first ever review to any movie. First, I hated Joaquin Phoenix in Gladiator movie so much that I really admire his acting. Then I read the making of the original story of my most beloved comic character of all universes and comic books and saw that it would be directed by Todd Phillips and staring Joaquin Phoenix and I was like ""this is gonna be bad"" as I was expecting an action twisted crazy Joker movie, but I was excited to see this movie as it's the first origin movie for the Joker.I saw the movie yesterday , and man what did I witnessed! Almost perfection in every aspect of movie making, cinematography, soundtracks, story, acting and directing.Story & screenwriting:Not going with a comic book story aspect was bold by Todd, yes there is a couple of cameos from several comic books Joker story, but this new narrative for the character was amazing. The buildup and the transition for the character was will done.
The screenwriting was also one of the best I've ever heard that takes on many real life issues, mental illness, society differences, capitalism, family issues, poverty, political corruption and media. All of this was delivered in a very well played story that shows how a really pile of issues can break a monster out of you.Acting:In short, Joaquin Phoenix killed it with his acting in this movie, the buildup for the character was out of this world acting performance, he carries this movie on his shoulder and he delivers amazingly. The Joker character has too much layers and it needs a lot of work to bring this character to life, that's why he's the most iconic villain character in comics history. Joaquin performance deserves an Oscar period. He's ability to take on this twisted Heavy character and make it his own is amazing, transforming himself from a sick delusion unworthy human to a master of chaos needs a big appreciation.Directing:Todd Philips really shows that he can deliver a dark heavy movies like Christopher Nolan, he brought this comic book character to the real life and make it worthy.Soundtrack:From the first moment, you'll be in a journey of building the Joker character not just with the acting but also with the music, the sadness and the heavy motions the music will give you throw the first half of the movie is amazing, and you'll feel the transition in the character theme music through the entire movie. I can't explain more you need to hear and watch the movie to understand the harmony between the acting and the music that played with it.
Conclusion:Joker movie exceeded my expectations by million mile, it's really a movie not about a comic character villain, it's a movie about life and how uneven society can be divided and controlled. How a really one bad day, can really make you lose it."
5655,"I do not want to go into detail about the movie's plot, as I believe that watching a movie becomes a better experience when the narrative is presented to you intact for the first time. However, I will say that this movie is not remotely one of the ""superhero"" kind, it is rather a gritty character study, as the description says. If you wanted to see who Joker the person is, you got it. It is handled with the expertise and maturity that is needed for such a complex task, and this is why i consider this portrayal of Joker to be better than any other one, as he is not presented as a caricature or a character with certain motivations in relation to a movie's plot, but as an actual person plagued by societal and mental issues that wanders through life. This is how the movie uses the medium of having him as a protagonist, and also how it succeeds with it.
All the movie's themes and symbols are tied into each other nicely, the strong moments hit as hard as they should because they are not sterilized in any way (a certain appartment scene comes to mind) and the runtime is used up perfectly. Overall, it is a tight and ballsy effort, one that I consider a flawless movie. Instant classic (many quotes will be used for an eternity), call it what you want to. At the end of the day, it is one of the movies that will be talked about for years to come. Do not miss it. And good luck to Mr. Phoenix in the Oscars."
5656,"The Joker movie is a journey of how society can make people explode, and turn them into rebels and anarchists.I wish the movie can be a first of many DC connected movies. They made me like and understand the Joker, not the character but the person and the ideology.Acting is a top notch, if Joaquin Phoenix did not get an oscar for his mesmerizing performance this year, then who will ?Storyline, direction, footage, colors, mood and cinematography are all very well done too.Easy 10/10, one of the best movies I've ever seen.A side note:- The Joker character is very close to Wael Ghonim in 2019 the activist who sparked the Egyptian uprising in 2011, ofcourse both are not related and Wael Ghonim is not a killer but both personalities have a lot in common."
5657,"***Spoilers ahead in what will be a very long read***First off, let's get this out of the way. This is a not your average comic-book romp with flashy CGI, placed humour (often forced) and grand centerpiece sequences. This a character study rooted deeply in the 70s-80s gritty dramas of which I have personally longed for a return to. It is clear to all, that is a Warner Bros film and not really a DC one from the title card and those who are expecting this film to be a faithful comic book adaptation will be disappointed. Personally, as a huge fan of that section of literature, I went into this film not expecting any lifting from the pages of comics or graphic novels and therefore, absolutely loved the end product. I do however have to state in no uncertain terms, that saying I love this film may be a misnomer on its own, as it is an extremely difficult watch. I felt overwhelmed, a little disturbed and all in all flabbergasted as the credits rolledMake no qualms about it, true comic-book fans will love this film and will understand that this is an Elseworlds story. Yes, it may be based in parts on the anarchic character (who in my opinion is comicbook-dom's greatest villain surpassing even Darkseid, Doctor Doom et al) whom we have gotten used to in various depictions on-screen. There are a few character traits and plot points lifted from the source material namely the failed comedian angle and the quote ""All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy"" (from Alan Moore's 'The Killing Joke'), the story taking place from the villain's point of view (from Brian Azzarello's 'Joker') and the climactic riots (from the line in Ed Brubaker's 'The Man Who Laughs' - ""One by nne, they'll hear my call. Then this wicked town, will follow my fall""), however that is where the similarities endTodd Philips is unapologetic in his clear tributes to various directors from the golden era of cinema. Never are they more apparent in his shot compositions, use of atmospheric music and noir themed cityscapes which harken back to the literary-cum-celluloid musings of Sidney Lumet, William Friedkin, Roman Polanski, Ingmar Bergman, Werner Herzog, Federico Fellini, Andrei Tarkovsky, Milos Forman and Claude Chabrol. He reserves his absolute homage to Martin Scorsese though, in the storyline and lead character's motivations. To think that the comedic director behind The Hangover trilogy (out of which only the first one was really great), Old School and War Dogs (a little more serious than his prior films) could come up with something this cerebral and violent is almost asinine. He succeeds brilliantly and puts all doubters to shame. It is set in the late 70s, early 80s Gotham City (analogous to the New York City of the same decade) where the rich are getting richer while the poor are getting poorer. There is a garbage strike, rats are abound in the city and crime is rampant. Gotham City is descending into a hellhole and many of its nondescript residents are its biggest victimsJoaquin Phoenix is an arresting presence, the focus throughout the film and he reels you in from the first frame of the film where we first meet Arthur Fleck. We see him sitting in front of a mirror and applying his clown make-up. He attempts to put on a smile and resorts to holding the corners of his mouth as a single tear rolls down his cheek unbeknownst to him, all the while disrupting his make-up with it. This single scene sets the tone for the film. How a carefully, regimented façade is disturbed and ultimately destroyed by a simple action. There is no costume or monologues, just a man. A sad clownPhoenix's gaunt and often emaciated appearance is scary (you can't help but wonder what he had to do to get in this ""shape"") and evokes memories of Christian Bale's Patrick Bateman from 'American Psycho'. He contorts his frail, spindly frame and on occasion breaks out into a frighteningly joyful, Kabuki-esque dance that is mesmerizing. Phoenix is in his absolute element, and proves once again why he is one of his generation's greatest actors. He portrays Fleck as one of life's victims, a freak to everyone else but someone who is constantly pushed down until he finally snaps. He is mocked, beaten up and often misunderstood by even those closest to him. Phoenix revels in showing pain in each and every sinew of his fibre, his eyes are haunting and hollow, his physicality is precise in the way he walks, sits, smokes or when he shrinks into the shadows. Fleck's hyena-like cackle is uncomfortable and painful and is attributed to Pseudobulbar Syndrome in the film but fits in very well with the overall narrative. You start to sympathize for Fleck but it soon turns from one of affinity similar to the ones we felt for the lead characters of 'Serpico' or 'Dog Day Afternoon', to one of pity that is more akin to the lead characters from 'Taxi Driver', 'A Clockwork Orange' and 'One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest'. His damnation begins with one after another ""bad day"" and ends in a brutal, violent and utterly savage actionsRobert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Brett Cullen, Frances Conroy and the rest of the cast are pretty much just supporting characters and they appear for a miniscule amount of time. They however perform well, De Niro especially, channeling his very own Rupert Papkin from 'The King of Comedy'. On the technical side, the film is littered with masterful brilliance. Scott Silver who co-wrote the film with Phillips utilizes simple but ultimately chilling dialogues to considerable effect. Lawrence Sher delivers a career best cinematography wherein his wide angle and close up shots were both immersive and introspective (especially on IMAX). I also have to give a very big kudos to composer Hildur Guðnadóttir, whose haunting theme, musical cues and overall soundtrack choice work perfectly throughout the film. This should be her big breakthrough and I foresee a lot of awards for her in the futureThere are a few drawbacks namely the fisting of certain characters from the larger Gotham universe which no doubt was done to appease the so-called modern comic-book fan. I for one felt that it was unnecessary as they could have been named anything else and it would not have made a dolt of difference in the end product. There is also a worry that the film glorifies incels who resort to violence, but then again, anyone with a sane mind would be able to differentiate real and reel lifeJoker has already won a few awards in its fledgling run, including the Leone d'Oro (Golden Lion for Best Film), Graffetta d'Oro (Audience Award for Best Film), Premio Soundtrack (Best Score) and an 8 minute standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival with Phoenix also winning the Tribute Actor award at the Toronto International Film Festival. This augurs well for the film's Academy Awards chances as the last two winners ('The Shape of Water' & 'Roma') both went on to win Best Picture at the Oscars. Joaquin Phoenix alongside Jake Gyllenhaal is one of my favourite actors who often win plaudits for their performances but not awards. In my opinion, Phoenix should be a shoo in for a Best Actor nomination joining Leonardo DiCaprio (for 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood'), Taron Egerton (for 'Rocketman') and potentially Adam Driver (for 'Marriage Story') as well as Christian Bale (for 'Ford v Ferrari')To compare this Joker with Mark Hamill's playful menace (from the animated series and several animated films), Heath Ledger's chilling anarchist (from 'The Dark Knight') or even Jack Nicholson kitschy gangster (from 1989's 'Batman') would be superfluous (I purposefully chose to ignore the meth-head emo dude that Jared Leto plays in 'Suicide Squad'). This is an origin story for ""A"" Joker not ""THE"" Joker and that is how we should evaluate the film. As the Clown Prince of Crime himself once said, ""If I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice""In this film, the Joker is someone who lets his mental illness get the better of him and essentially leads him into what he feels is justifiable violence. This Joker is born of our apathy, we made him and we deserve him"
5658,"Joaquin Phoenix steals the show in this beautifully crafted show. From storyline, direction, acting to post-production everything was handled really well.there is gore violence in the movie, but at no point is it unnecessary or not a part of the story. it speaks to the character's development and gives us a glimpse into the mental state of ""Joker"". at the end of the movie, you could be forgiven for feeling sorry for Joker and all those who oppress us. No wonder US Police Department issued advisories to local state departments to guard the area outside movie theatres.It is a must watch, even if you have no idea of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or Batman. There is a small overlap with Batman and the Wayne family, but you will be able to understand the movie even if you don't have knowledge of Batman Universe"
5659,"As the mentally ill and socially ignored Arthur, Phoenix burns a hole in the screen,"" our CNET reviewer Rich Trenholm writes. ""From the opening moment when he cracks his mouth into an unnerving fake smile, the three-time Oscar nominee commands your attention."""
5660,"I think this movie is amazing
Joaquin Phoenix deserve oscar
The whole story is very inspiring"
5661,"Watched Joker Starring Joaquin Phoenix (Gladiator) as Arthur Fleck/Joker, Zazie Beetz(Deadpool 2) as Sophie Dumond, Brett Cullen(The Amazing Spider-Man 2) as Thomas Wayne, and Robert De Niro(Taxi Driver) as Murray Franklin.while this is well crafted and well acted i didn't enjoy the message this film was saying Ledgers Joker is still The Gold Standard also a Blatant Rip-off of Taxi Driver I hope it loses to Ad Astra During Awards season and I liked Shazam better which Wins 2019 DC For me Worst Movie Of 2019 .That said amazing Direction from Todd Phillips(The Hangover) Cinematography By Lawrence Sher(The Big Year ) & Amazing Score from Hildur Guonadottir(Sicario: Day Of Soladido) Worst Movie Of 2019 . 2/10"
5662,"For me, movies ultimately rise or fall based on the strength of the story, plot and dialogue. I'll also say that (again, for me) the Joker as a character - be it onscreen or in comic books/graphic novels - tends to work best when the character is used sparingly, along with the motivations leaning toward psychotic yet focused disruption and the origins being unexplained.
Well, 2019's JOKER lays everything bare in this Joker-centric (centric to the point where it is all Phoenix/Joker to the virtual exclusion of anything else) flick, although Phoenix doesn't complete the transformation into what we traditionally recognize as the Joker until very late into the 2 hour film. Which makes sense, because ultimately this is an origin film, yet by taking such a lengthy look at what made the Joker the way he is all the mystery is removed.
What JOKER boils down to is a long, grimy look at a middle-aged man suffering from mental illness who can't hold a job, has aspirations of fame yet possesses no discernable talents to achieve the popularity he craves, has a friendless/sexless existence, lives with his mother, is mistreated by society, goes off his meds and eventually explodes murderous rages. The awe one may have held previous Joker incarnations such as 2008's The Dark Knight - where the Joker's actions have degrees of malevolent brilliance - is totally absent here. There's certainly nothing in JOKER to ""root"" for, unless one holds ""I've been wronged by society and life has screwed me over"" spree killers in high esteem, so the climatic scenes come off as pathetically repellent. JOKER here is a sad-sack loser to be, at best, pitied. There's no wit or intelligence behind his malevolence here.
3 stars, and solely for Joaquin Phoenix, who certainly throws himself completely into the role and amply demonstrates his superior acting ability. Unfortunately, the ability he brings and the effort he expends is in service of a rather pointless undertaking. I'm a big fan of the Joker as a character, but not the way he was written here. I'm also a big fan of Phoenix, and while he does have the ability to elevate material that isn't up to his talents even an actor of his caliber can only elevate a poorly constructed plot so high."
5663,"Boring movie, was hoping it would end sooner than it did.The movie is purely about Joaquin Phoenix."
5664,"I really don't understand why does the people like Joker's character so much. ""World is always unfair get use to it."" It does not make sense at all that a person should response to the society this way. I don't know which direction people are going and what will they achieve by following, enjoying, encouraging, appreciating this kind of character."
5665,"First off, Joaquin Phoenix reminded us why he's such a skilled immersive actor. He appears to do crazy quite well. But that's where it ended for me. Yes I've heard tons of people say that Joker is a masterpiece, brilliant, magnificent, blah...blah...blah. But in my opinion, it was a vicious mocking parable about mental illness. It directly connected mental illness and violence. If a person is mentally ill, then the likelihood that they'll eventually turn into a full-blown murderous psychopath is almost a 100% according to this film. Joker does nothing but further stigmatize mental illness, and it is a tired, worn-out destructive trope that Hollywood simply can't seem to move away from.Arthur Fleck (the Joker) is a broken, emotionally spent man, who has been dealt a series of bad hands in life. He's poor, lives in a depressed neighborhood, has a failed career as a clown, a sick mother (who we later learn has lied to him all of his life), been bullied unmercifully and is looking for some sort of human connection as he walks around Gotham (New York City in the 70s/early 80's). But this is a story that a lot of people can tell, but by no means does that say they're pushed to murder. Most folks take their meds, get therapy and work their way out of their unfortunate circumstances. Joker is also a story that has been told in films multiple times, and this film steals heavily from The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver and surprise, Robert De Niro is in the Joker.Then you have the other go-to Hollywood tropes....the single Black mother played by Zazie Beetz (Fleck's fantasy love interest, don't get me started with this), the angry Black woman, the distant unfeeling, uncaring Black woman, and by the way, none of these women were used as plot devices, they were simply convenient props. Oh, and lets throw in a little class warfare and wealth disparity to put the period at the end of the sentence of tropes.Anyone thinking that this is another incarnation of the comic book Joker characters we've seen before, will either be greatly disappointed or resoundingly relieved. There's no suited and booted superhero, no cool gadgets, no bat cave, no bat mobile or bat signal. This film is a dark, unsettling, meandering look at Fleck's descent into self-destruction and homicide, with the backdrop of old school New York City's grime, despair, poverty and filth. Joker is a stand-alone, brutal psychological thriller that simply wears out its welcome very quickly. But it'll make a ton of money, and no matter how mocking this film is of mental illness and Black women, money is really all that matters in Hollywood."
5666,"Seriously...After a very long time, got my expectations whacked and buried into the ground.
No memorable lines, no music, no story, no motive, no messages....Nothing- Just Joaquin Phoenix trying too hard to carry a movie that's seriously worth nothing without his acting.And it's so long and boring that you can seriously notice your fingernails grow."
5667,"It was not what I expected. It was mostly the psychological side of what made him become the joker. The lack of action and violence made it rather uninteresting and 1 hr (half way) through the film you already feel like it has been 3hrs as it drags on. If you enjoy psychological mental illness documenterais with very limited action, then this is your film."
5668,The worse movie in the year I never enjoyed with this bad movie 👎👎👎
5669,"Ages 12-35 will love this movie. Like seemingly every other character study in Hollywood, it exaggerates the impact of poor parenting and bullying to appeal to the masses who feel a certain way about how poorly their life has gone. The movie wanted to be realistic and gritty, but it wasn't. If just one person could show me where all of these 30 year olds who are getting bullied for doing their jobs are, maybe it would validate some of the ridiculousness.
Using a famous character unnecessarily to make this movie is another issue I took. Creativity is lacking though, and money must be made, so I digress.
The pacing was decent, but the first 1.5 hours were almost too boring to stay awake though. The redeeming quality was the acting, though not ""Oscar worthy"". Phoenix almost always turns in a good performance as one of the more versatile actors."
5670,"Joker is an absolute game-changer for the superhero genre and the movie industry in general. Gritty, insightful and stunning, Joker is by far the film of the year, and Joaquin Phoenix deserves to run home with the best actor Oscar come February."
5671,"This movie is beautiful. There wasn't one scene I thought was useless and the cinematography was absolutely stunning, dark yet vibrant."
5672,"Never before have I seen something so game changing in a movie. The crowd was just losing their collective minds the second it started to roll. Just imagine a film that combines the best elements of Avengers, Dressed to Kill, 12 Years A Slave, UHF, Cassablanca, Black Panther, the series Justified, and Wild Things yet remains at its core a hard R girl gang film and that is your culture cinematic event that will forever change how you experience the theater. That is what we can expect from Birds of Prey. I guess Joker was alright too, but all anybody could think about was that Birds of Prey trailer at the beginning. I mean, it was simply glorious."
5673,"This movie is hot garbage, the only thing good about the movie was Joaquin acting. There's no reason for this movie to have been all over the news and for theaters to have police on site in certain cities, only 6 people died by the joker in the movie and were by accident. If the original Purge would have featured the Joker then it would have made perfect sense for all the hype around this film. I mean how can the joker clearly imagine being on the Murry show and that be real but not to have really fallen in love with single mom for example, that would have made the movie wayyy more interesting."
5674,"I'm sure it can be argued that the acting was amazing, but the movie was so slow and riddled with history. Boring."
5675,This movie was horrible it was a poor imitation of taxi driver and the king of comedy. You have a nutcase taking a handful of pills and then all of a sudden becomes a mastermind criminal take off the grease paint he's just a Cult leading serial killer
5676,"Yeah, after all it's about a villain, right!? But anyway, too dramatic, too depressing, too much tragedy, I didn't like it at all, definitely not my type of movie...A villain is a victim of a terrible society, mental disorders, family issues and bad politicians and business men? Of course he is and I don't need a movie to tell it, I simply turn on the TV on any News and I'll see several Gothan cities and Arthurs around the world, simply like that... And not to mention the emotional appeal they use during the whole movie for the Arthur character transforming him into a hero for the citizens by the end of movie... Really!? He's a villain, a bad guy and people are enjoying this whole crap!? C'mon!!! For God sake! Sorry, terrible movie but a regular job regarding the actors, not worth of all this hype at all!!! Unbelievable..."
5677,"Just One word for the movie ""LAME""
I mean jaquin is awesome i mean awesome but the storyline sucks at every point...."
5678,"Hated everything about this movie, except Phoenix's performance. Too long and slow paced. Director tried to do an ""artsy"" take on the comic book genre and in my opinion, he completely missed the point. Joker is a character invented more than 60 years ago, throwing away all that history is an insult to all comic book lovers"
5679,I tried to watch this movie. 35 minutes in I was ready to turn it off. I lasted an hour. What garbage.
5680,Phoenix plays an ultraviolent psychopath very well. But unfortunately we learn nothing from that. Is the film: inspirational? No. Entertaining? No. Thought provoking? No. Just supposed justified/righteous violence. No redeeming value. Time and money wasted.
5681,So much hype for nothing. The film is all along unpleasant annoying dark and unbearable. I promise you you won't miss anything. Do yourself a favor and ignore the hype.
5682,"Yeah, it's dark and has a good story. But it was slow. I am not looking for an action flick, but gosh this was a lot of Phoenix performing an evil laugh. Okay, he should win so nothing for that demented laugh."
5683,"Please........this movie comes under action and superhero typo genre.......you can't just make it a slow film and just expect people to love it because of good acting........the whole movie stood only because of acting perfection........other than that there is nothing!!!!No logical story.......joker kills 3 and the whole society rejoices and starts a revolution???????What????Lack of action scenes,the type which everyone would expect for.......too slow a movie......just can't imagine how it got such a rating from critics.......and these same critics give bad comment for horror films for 'bad storyline'.......HYPOCRITES!!!"
5684,"Don't know what all these reviews are about, it's a masterpiece etc etc it's really not! I fell asleep half way through and woke up purposely to see the ending which still didn't do anything for me!Bore off!!! Let's hope the sequel isn't as dry and plotless as this was!"
5685,"Dull, repetitive, drawn out. Some flashes of brilliance when he finally becomes 'the joker', with fabulous atmospheric's and some gritty scenes but really too much lingering on the same things."
5686,"Stand alone, with no prior Batman knowledge: this film is probably closer at an 8 or 9. My major problem is they tried too hard to make you side with Joker. To justify everything. To understand him. And I don't think his first murders (the ones that started him down the path, guys on the subway) were completely unjustified. The only one that you couldn't really side with was when he killed the other clown. This doesn't fit the Joker from every other description of him. He's supposed to just be an insane murderous clown who wants to watch the world burn. You're not supposed to understand him or side with him. It wasn't dark and twisted enough to be a good Joker origin movie. It was all just too cliche and predictable. Bullied semi-oedipal outcast turned murder. There's a better orgin story than that for Joker. Joker wouldn't have been created by situations that everyday people deal with. That monster was born and molded by something way more sinister. Also, Batman was never able to figure out Joker's identity. This movie makes it easy for Batman to figure out who he is."
5687,"Hi, first of all I tried not to compare this to Heath's performance, but after half the film passed by the grip of what could have and replaced by oh no, I must say Joker's display was one of feeble stance. Sure life knocks you in the face with iron knuckles, yet Heath showed it could be appreciated with a smirk. Phoenix buckles inward because he just can't help it and doesn't like it.
This might have been set up as a possible gate way to how and when he started to be Joker as we all hoped to see, but it sure as beep left me seeing a sorry of an excuse to turn so dark for some everyday struggle gone bad and turn left at revenge intersection.
Never was, in my recollection, Joker set out best as the dog who didn't know what he'd do once he got hold of the bumper of a car going by. Now they showed a possible reason why, and deep down they shouldn't have showed this. It's too beep easy passing the start frame and collect your 2000. Joker is matured insanity, should they have put some in the movie all could have been overlooked."
5688,"Is the film great? Yes. Does it redefine the comic book genre in a big way? Not at all. This ISN'T a comic book film in any way. In fact if the film wasnt called Joker the film wouldn't change at all. So to say it redefines something it isn't is redundant. Phoneix is amazing and does deserve an Oscar as the acting is outstanding. However, the story forces itself forward.
Gotham in the 80s is a horrible city full of horrible people. So when 3 rich people die, would the entire city turn to rioting? When people are probably getting murderer left, right and centre. There are no witnesses to the initial murders yet everyone knows its a clown.Arthur then does some bad stand up which someone how makes it on to national TV. As a one of it seems like a stretch but to then invite him on the show?Arthur was abused heavily as a child and his mother was locked away in a precursor to arkham asylum. How Arthur ends up back living with her is never explained. Probably because they couldn't find a reason why it would happen.
So
Is it a good film? Acting wise its superb, story wise it's a bit wishy washy.Is it a good comic book film??NoIs it a good Joker film? No. As amazing as Phoneix is, this is probably the least Joker ish film I've ever seen and therfore the worst joker. Even worse than Letos. This joker is just a broken man and who is clearly mentally ill. This character poses zero threat to Batman.If if wasn't for the acting is score the film lower."
5689,"Berate me new generation about what is funny. Is not-being-able-to-funny, funny? Is cringe comedy (bspw: Borat) really funny enough? Blend it with some pseudo-arthouse Bullsheiße and ta-da you have the movie Joker.Normally; mentally challenged manchilds' stories are not favored by Hollywood too much, however this movie is an exception of this category. Joaquin Phoenix really succeeded to act as a mentally challenged character. I advise that the Academy Award would be given to him. I mean, aren't the new generation dumb enough to know the difference between Joker and Taxi Driver? Travis Scott ia also troubled but smart nonetheless.The ""HAH HAAH HAAAH HAAAAH HAAAAAH HAAAAAAH HAAAAAAAH!"" laugh was used too much. Those would be peak points but if it's used in half of the sccenes, it would lose effect and starts to become boring. I cringed a lot in this movie, on how cheaply they tried to express an idea. Look at the girlfriend character of Joker! She was added because Joker wouldn't look like a loser. One can't manage to get the point.Also, they squeezed in Batman character unnecessarily in a boring way. That's why I'm giving 4/10, not 5/10."
5690,"... Chapter Two, the OTHER killer clown in theaters.This Joker movie is ripe with cynicism, it probably is the only way to get the audience to sympathize with a sociopathic killer. Yuck"
5691,How can I get the 2.5hrs back please. It felt like 10hrs.
5692,I had migraine headache for 2 days after this movie!! It's too personal!!
5693,"This is some edgelord BS. The only reason people praise it is because it defies ""Superhero/Supervillian"" norms and has an R Rating. If you put it beside some real art and psychological films, it wouldn't even stand a chance. Everything is so surface level yet people act like they're ""deep"" for getting it. The dancing seems thrown in to give the film an ""artsy"" edge. I could tell that certain scenes were supposed to be haunting, but they came across as very dry and bland. There's a lot of incel-ish and ""edgy"" dialogue throughout too, and none of it sounds profound. It's pretty much the same old stuff about mental ills, ""society"" and, ""the rich"", and it's not presented in a new way at all. People just went crazy over it because Joker was involved.Basically, this is an incredibly generic psychological drama with scenes of violence thrown in every 15-20 minutes to ""shock"". It only deserves one star, but I gave an extra one because there are a few dark comedy bits that I liked. In no way does this compare to Heath Ledger, he brought a certain nuance and charm to the Joker that this film does not have."
5694,"Wow. This film is more realistic than any other comic book character, ever. Joaquin Phoenix will finally get his Oscar, as will Todd Phillips for bringing his brilliant vision to life. This film is perfection in every aspect, although I would've liked the pace a little faster with about 10 min of 122 min runtime trimmed down. Still, wow. 9/10 from me."
5695,"Overhyped film, really slow, predictable, low budget, hardly any fight scenes. Didn't enjoy it in the cinema and almost fell asleep. Would of got up and walked out for a refund if I was on my own. Heath ledgers performance as the joker was more believable, scary and funny.This joker film isn't funny and I didn't laugh once. It's a low budget cash grab, with an actor who cant laugh properly and someone who clearly wasnt invested in his role and was clearly after the pay cheque. No wonder he has not been so active in movies for years. He is so unlikeable.Joker is simply overhyped."
5696,Whilst Joaquin Phoenix shines as the Joker this movie was an extremely blasphemous telling of his story. Rating the movie as a tragic tale of a tortured soul driven to the breaking point I'd rate it 7 out of 10. But as the origin story of the Joker I'd rate as being on the waiting list to get to 0. So many things that just are blasphemous to the Batman universe and to the history of the Joker. I can't.
5697,The movie seems to drag on towards the end. And when they do end the movie it was very unsatisfying. I felt like there were multiple times to end the movie before they did that were much better. The acting was good overall.
5698,"I have never done a review before, but now walked out so I can read my book properly I felt compelled to warn people off this boring overly long self indulgent waste of money"
5699,"Idk why people are so excited about this. I don't care about the snowflake violence complaints. It was really slow, he's a sad boi, laughs, kills some people, dances, and that's about it. Saved you two hours."
5700,"First thing I want to say is that I made this account right after I finished watching this movie and that should tell you something right off the bat. If you're looking for action or anything remotely interesting, this isn't a movie for you. My time watching this movie is pretty much wasted, I should have stayed at home and watched anything else or played games rather than going to the cinema to watch this.... I wonder how much money did they pay the people that gave this movie 10/10.The whole movie is painfully slow going and around the middle of the movie when you actually start having a thought of leaving the cinema, they give you a bit of action that will prolong your hopes of something actually starting to happen. Then it's back to the same old torture. The last 5-10 minutes of the movie are better then the rest 110 min of it and even then it's kinda meh, totally average. Hell, the first 110 min should have been flashbacks or something that was condensed in 10-15 minutes to start off a real Joker movie, then insert the end to heat things up a bit in the middle of it and finally get into some real action with Batman.My advice, go watch a cartoon rather than this movie. You will probably enjoy it more..."
5701,"Character development of a mental guy in a sadistic backdrop like subway stations, dull and disgusting apartment. So what if Phoenix acts well, it's truly a disturbing movie. I wouldn't spend a single dime to get depressed. Forget comparing this with Heath Ledger's stellar performance. Stay at home watching Netflix."
5702,"Good and great reality movie in 2019, only children dint like this kind of movie."
5703,But nothing really special. This is not a 10/10 movie. Good acting but at the end it doesn't leave me thinking. This movie will not stay with me because it's an average movie. Realistic rating is 6/10. I gave it 1 because of all 10/10's. The score needs to go down.
5704,"You'd think from the trailers you're getting a masterpiece, but it's really just 2 hours of closeups of Joaquim Phoenix face making pained expressions. By the end of the movie, you'll wish you had gone to see It Pt 2 instead, because least that clown was interesting. Too serious for its own good.
This movie is going to be a Choker, it's not going to do well. Todd Philips should stick to Hangover movies."
5705,This is the most stupid Joker movie i ever seen in my life.
5706,"A stinker, no talent hack behaving like he does everyday, bad script, no plot, no fun."
5707,Phoenix may have excelled as a drug dependent slipping into a carte blanc rubber room but the movie itself was slow and torturous. I was looking at my watch 30 minutes into it. Wait for it on tv.
5708,Very boring musical with no plot. Every scene had 10 minutes music background.
5709,"I really don't get all the hype about this movie. Depressing, disturbing, boring, no plot, no messages..all you get from this movie is the anger for the two wasted hours of your life.
Half the movie is about Phoenix loughing and dancing hysterically.
Without competition by far the worst movie I have ever seen."
5710,I set the bar to high and I was disappointed about the acting..storyline..but the directing wasn't that bad
5711,The glorification of nihilism. Revenge for the sake of revenge. Destruction for the sake of destruction. Lack of any constructive message. Pictures - technically good.
5712,So boring and slow how could this movie get such a high review score?
5713,"This is a ok movie, it you enjoy comic book type movies. However its extremely predictable. Also I felt the actors did a good job but this is in no way an award winning movie in anyway"
5714,"Such a dark disappointment. Found it quite boring, wish I hadn't watched the whole movie. Movies like this getting so many 10's make me think someone has figured out how to submit 100's of reviews to skew results."
5715,This story is so obnoxious and uninteresting. The worst fast and the furious is better.
5716,"Just horrible......
They have ruined the Joker in this movie! Nothing like poorly twisting around people's illness's for profit."
5717,"I know this not a comedy movie or a action movie but it was so boring the story was not interesting at all not a single moment of feeling attached to this movie,,how this movie become movie of the year....of course lot of money spend on promotion which make an psychological effect on the peoples mind that this is the best movie."
5718,"Very negative movie with great acting ? No , it doesn't bring join to me at all. Why should it ? Life is beautiful. If you find this movie attractive,then you have a depressing life."
5719,"The acting was so fresh and the cinematography so crisp there's no way anyone could come away from this movie disappointed. Upset and distressed, maybe - I think what makes Joker outstanding in 2019 is that this movie rips rips apart at the ideology that deep within people are inherently good. That aside it's a very entertaining Batman film and I can't wait for a sequel!"
5720,The acting was brilliant. The story line was crap. The movies was strange and dragged on. Dont know what the hype was all about. Definitely not movie of the year.
5721,"This is one of those movies that uses top of the line production and a sky-high budget to mask an average-at-best storyline. Now before I say any more, Joaquin Phoenix did a phenomenal job here and absolutely destroyed the role of the joker. But that is where the problems began -- the role of the joker. Most people know that this movie is the prelude to the modern joker (Suicide Squad, Dark Knight, etc..) but the delivery of the storyline starts to drag out about halfway through the movie. The movie is a true slow burn that sort of glosses over a major storyline of Thomas Wayne; the joker and batman are seemingly half-brothers now. This was a half-baked attempt to leave the franchise wide open. All in all, the Joker's disturbing personality and the mental health implications make this movie worth seeing. But with all the hype surrounding the movie, I was mildly dissapointed."
5722,Overly hyped. Good but not great. Expected a lot after the word of mouth from people and tv
