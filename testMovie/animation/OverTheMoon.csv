0,"I don't know why but this film gives me very familiar feelings, nostalgia almost, nostalgia for Disney's renaissance. When I was watching and listening to the songs or the beautiful colors in the screen I felt a reminiscent feeling. This movie is amazing please watch it"
1,"Young Fei Fei (Cathy Ang) over the course of her childhood is told of ancient legends of moon goddess Chang'e (Phillipa Soo) by her mother (Ruthie Ann Miles). After her mother passes from a terminal illness Fei Fei is shaken by the prospect that her father (John Cho) will marry Mrs. Zhong (Sandra Oh) and believing the stories told by her mother hold the key to preventing this Fei Fei builds a rocket to the moon to find the moon goddess Chang'e only for her soon to be stepbrother Chin (Robert G Chiu) throwing a monkey wrench into her plans and setting them on an unplanned detour.Over the Moon is the third feature film co-production from Netflix's animation division following Klaus and The Willoughbys. Klaus was probably in my top 10 list for that year, and while I didn't think The Willoughby's was in the same league, I still appreciate the craft and care that went into it making it look as good or better than some films that got a theatrical release. With Over the Moon co-produced with Pearl Studio (Abominable), I'm pleased to say this film is closer to the former than the latter.The film is the feature length animated debut for John Kahrs (director of amazing short Paperman) and Glen Keane (Dear Basketball) and both have work in the industry coming from Pixar as well as back to the early days of the Disney Renaissance. Needless to say, their A game has been brought and delivers. The animation in this movie is simply incredible. The vibrancy and life of Fei Fei's home town, the energy brought to the comic relief characters (of which there maybe a few too many), the emptiness of space, and some scenes of sheer awe and wonder that deserve to be experienced so I'll avoid spoiling them, save for saying they're as imaginative as anything Winsor McCay created for his Little Nemo comic strips back in the early 1900s.The story is absolutely amazing showing the importance of family, but also the threat of getting stuck in the past and refusing to move past it (with some eerily effective imagery in the film's climax. The movie is a musical with Christopher Curtis, Marjorie Duffield and Helen Park serving as the song writers, and the score they come up with is as vibrant and powerful as the upper levels of the Disney Renaissance. The songs range from more traditional melodies to more modern compositions to sometimes skirting the lines and being compositions of both, in this way it's very much enhancing the theme of appreciating the old while allowing acceptance of the new.Fei Fei makes a likable lead as we see her emotional jounrey and it parallels nicely with the Chang'e legend as presented in the film. Fei Fei is brought to life by not only great expressive animation but also by Cathy Ang giving a great VO performance that hits all the right notes. The rest of the voice cast do a terrific job and play their parts well. Some of the comic relief do flirt with becoming grating and overbearing, but luckily what annoyance there are to the characters feel (mostly) true to life and feel earned in relation to the rest of the movie that surrounds them. There are also a few lowbrow gags, but they're luckily used sparingly and never overstay their welcome.Over the Moon is a terrific film that shows that both Pearl Studio and Netflix Animation are worthy contenders among the crowded animation field. With fantastic visuals, likable characters, a dynamic musical score, and a story that strikes the right emotional chords, the movie is able to overcome the few minor drawbacks keep it from being perfect. While some of the comic relief feels unnecessary, it's balanced out by a cohesive whole of ingredients that make for a beautiful and moving animated visual feast."
2,"As a Chinese person, I LOVED seeing so much wonderful cultural representation and the all-Asian cast. As a kid, there was very little of this type of thing available to me and I'm happy that my four year old enjoys this movie and sees positive representations of this part of her heritage.I thought the visuals were stunning, and the animation and character design were lovely.Otherwise, it was... fine. I feel like the movie started off strong. I got teary during the first part. Then the story just got kind of confusing and I felt very little emotional connection to the characters. The singing is good, but I didn't find the music as catchy or memorable as some other recent musicals. I'll watch this again with my kid and I prefer it to something like Frozen, Cars, or The Good Dinosaur, but I don't think it's as good as my favorite Pixar films like Wall-e or Monsters, Inc."
3,"It's quite often when an animated film comes out and they try to imitate or to simulate the same narrative aspects or the same characterisation or even the same animated standards of Disney. Sometimes it's so good it stands out, but other times the story mechanics are very familiar with Disney that it can make the film very far from being a success. Over the Moon is a charming Chinese inspired animation that's both victim to that but also different to that and thankfully sets the bar quite high in animated filmmaking. The story is very familiar a teenage girl is trying to get over the death of her mother and to do that she must embark on a journey of enlightenment to move on. We've seen it all before, but the one thing that's different is the colours whether it's the weird and wonderful creatures walking around or the stunning picturesque views of China's landscape. It will often remind you of Spirited Away or Inside Out or other brilliantly successful animations. Granted Over the Moon may not be new when it comes to the storytelling or the pain we all experience when feeling grief but the colours alone make it a wild success and lest we forget the glorious tunes to boot which will make you cry, make you dance and make you smile. It's likely that Netflix will go to the Oscars with this but whether they'll get the prize is a different story. But it flies high past other films of 2020 and could actually be the best animated film of the year...maybe. 4/5."
4,"If you love animated movies, this is amazing. The story is amazing, the songs are amazing. This truly is one of the best animated movies I've seen in a while. And Phillipa Soo is a rockstar."
5,"""Over the Moon"" is a computer-animated film produced by Netflix Animation (American) and Pearl Studios (Chinese). The Chinese legend about Chang'e had been developed into this screenplay by Audrey Wells, who had unfortunately succumbed to cancer in 2018. Director Glen Keane had been an animator involved in Disney films from ""The Little Mermaid"" to ""Tangled."" ""Over the Moon"" is Keane's first full-length directorial work. Keane recently won an Oscar for the animated short film ""Dear Basketball"" (2017) with the late Kobe Bryant.Spirited teenager Fei Fei had been in mourning for four years already following a family tragedy. However, while her family was ready to move on, she still could not accept the inevitable changes about to come into her life. She was also disappointed that legends about the Moon Goddess Chang'e she held dear in her childhood had all been forgotten at her home. Because of this, Fei Fei was determined to build a rocket to bring her to the moon to prove that Chang'e really existed.The voice cast for this production was predominantly Asian-American. Most notably, the main character of Chang'e was voiced by Chinese-American Broadway sensation Phillipa Soo, who broke through into mainstream stardom as Eliza Schuyler in mega-hit show ""Hamilton."" Korean-American actors John Cho and Ruthie Ann Miles voiced Fei Fei's parents, Baba and Mama. Other Korean-American actors in the cast were Margaret Cho (as Auntie Ling), Sandra Oh (as Mrs. Zhong) and Ken Jeong (as a green gelatinous glowworm named Gobi).The remarkable discovery here is 25-year old Cathy Ang who voiced the protagonist Fei Fei. Ang was born in the US to Filipino-Chinese parents who were both doctors from the Philippines. Her speaking voice was very perky and expressive, while her singing voice was so delightfully Disney-esque. This was an auspicious feature film debut for this impressive young talent. Another Filipino-American talent in the cast is Glenn Ricamora, who voiced the smaller role of Houyi, the archer husband whom Chang'e longed to reunite with.Even if this film was set in contemporary times, the central story and animation are very rich in Chinese culture and aesthetics. Aside from the legend of Chang'e and how she became the Moon Goddess, there were little details about the Mid-Autumn Festival, the moon cakes and the family gathering together for a special dinner while admiring the bright round full moon. The artwork for animals were very cute, like Bungee the bunny, or elegant, like the white egret on the waterway. The beautiful traditional gowns of Chang'e were very gracefully rendered.Midway through, there would be a radical shift of setting, pace and artistic theme to more whimsical modern sci-fi designs, all bursting with bright neon colors. Young kids will definitely enjoy the gleefully imaginative rainbow-colored imagery in this frenetic part of the film, like Chang'e grand entrance, chickens on motorbikes, flying lions, a celestial ping-pong match, or that mad scramble to possess a precious item. The dramatic scenes were also very effectively executed like the reunion scene as well the scene in the Chamber of Exquisite Sadness.The songs had catchy poppy tunes which would be fun to listen to again and again. The story of moving on after a family tragedy may be very familiar dramatic terrain, but it was tackled here with bold eye-catching artwork and genuinely moving sentiments."
6,Top notch animation. but if you've seen as many animated films as i've done then the plot won't stand out in any way.
7,I have to laugh at people complaining about this movie because it's a musical or mentions the moon a lot. Like... yeah. The trailer pretty efficiently covers that! Anyway... More than once I was awed at the colors and visuals. The storyline is sweet and a little sad. All of the songs were so beautiful. But what else can I expect from a movie starring Philippa Soo? Plus I love to see the representation!!
8,"Over the moon
2020
U
Director: Glen keane and John Kahrs
Starring: Ken Jeong, Sandra Oh, Kimiko Glenn, Phillipa Soo, John Cho, Cathy Ang etcOverall rating 88/100Over the moon is about a young girl who lost her mother who believed in a mythical goddess called Chang'e (Phillipa Soo) but her father moves on and his believe in her depletes, so she builds a rocket ship to prove her reality. Over the moon was a fantastic movie, with some of the best animation I have seen and some excellent themes that were touched upon, so let's get started.My first few positives would be the animation, representation, likeable main character and humour. The animation for this movie was truly breath-taking, the story world created and beautiful vibrant colours and character designs were just amazing to watch, and how incredibly life like the human characters were was truly something special. I also loved the representation within the movie, the large amount of chines representation was great, they went in depth with the key visual styles and traditions of the Chinese people and their lives and I found it really interesting. The main character was also very likeable, she had such a likeable charm and a beautiful voice, you genuinely empathised with her character and understood the way she reacted with her dad moving on with another woman, finally the movie was also very funny, it had so many well times jokes and clever slapstick moments that just worked 90% of the time.My next few positives would be the soundtrack, chemistry between characters as well as their links with each other. The movie had a surprisingly fantastic soundtrack with some catchy and heartwarming songs that were easy to get in your head and made the movie even more enjoyable to watch. I also found that there was fantastic chemistry between all of the characters, the relationship between the whole family felt so believable and they all had such a close bond it really reminded me of my own family and I think this will connect with a lot of families watching, I also liked the clever links between the characters. The links between Chang'e and Fei Fei (Cathy Ang) were actually very similar in terms of what they were going through with losing a loved one, this was explored and executed very well and their bond was something truly special and charming.My few negatives that effected the movie slightly would be the rushed character background, underused characters and tonal conflicts. I thought that despite the sweet beginning showing Fe Fe and her family for me it felt slightly to rushed and it would have been nice to see more of the families dynamic, I also found the character of the father very underused, yes he was the motivation for the main plot point but he wasn't really in the movie long enough and often times there was some lapses in the logic with him just not being aware that his daughter was making a rocket. Finally my biggest issue with the movie would have been its tonal conflicts, I just felt like the movie had too sharp contrasts between the beautiful culture of China and authentic relationships with a completely unrealistic and crazy world you got used to it after a while but such a sharp contrast for me didn't work in places.My final few positives would be the themes, emotional weight and heart-warming ending. The movie had very emotional and thoughtful themes that were explored well, the themes about moving on when a loved one passes away but still holding them close was very deep and told extremely well with characters that you could connect and sympathise with, due to this the movie had a lot of emotional weight, it was absolutely heart-breaking to see how badly the main character reacted when her father moved on despite understanding you also could understand Fefe and why she was reacting the way she was it was all handled very delicately and subtly to perfection. And finally the movie had a very heartwarming ending, there wa satisfying and heartfelt character arcs for everyone, and to see the new family form but the mother being such a big part with visual metaphors it was just handled beautifully.Overall despite some tonal issues, over the moon is an emotional, well thought and fun adventure for all that has some of the best animation I have seen with a heartfelt message that will hit home with a lot of people."
9,"The animation starts really well. The animation, although not as impressive as Disney or Pixar, was still really beautiful. The setting for the story really draws you in. The characters are likable. Up until the point of FeiFei's journey to the moon. The setting is just awful to look at. The whole popstar Chang'e thing was just awful. Why was it there? I don't know, but it was completely unnecessary and jarring. Speaking of the songs in this movie - they are just not memorable. Again it just reminds you how much better Disney is at creating musical pieces which grip you and stay with you. Perhaps it would have been better to just leave out the singing. Especially the pop numbers. From that moment on the characters become kind of bland and lose me. Their motivations are questionable. The pacing is all over the place. I just couldn't wait fir the whole thing to end. It could have been a great movie but it's like they run out o steam mid writing and animating and it just turned into awfulness. I'd rate it between 4-5. Gave it 5 stars for the strong introduction to the story."
10,"Sweet,touching,funny story about loss. Lot of singing but I didnt mind"
11,This movie was magical from start to finish! I loved the Asian actor representation as well to highlight a Chinese fable. They really did it justice. Highly recommend. Will be buying for my kids!
12,"Started of very well, nice and gripping story. And then comes the moon with neon colors and a stupid pop star God.
Is this what we really want to show the children? There are better ways to tell a story about loss and progress with life."
13,"I enjoyed the cultural aspects of this film, the animation, and the music. I would have loved to rate this film higher but the story was lacking in several areas.
Her father and Mrs. Zhong are just getting married? And Fei Fei never even knew they were seeing eachother? Why did her father's fiancé put the charm in her mooncake in the first place? It is eluded to that the fiancé is distantly related to Houyi who originally had the charm; however, that doesn't explain why the fiancé chose to place a presumably valuable family heirloom in Fei Fei's food. It also would have taken one or two sentences to explain why Chang'e needed the gift but instead she just starts demanding it from Fei Fei with no explanation.
Maybe the story would have made more sense if I was previously aware of the legend of Chang'e, Houyi, and Jade Rabbit. Did she only have so much time in general to bring back Houyi? And did she always have the power to beam people to the moon? If so for both, why couldn't she have beamed the charm/""gift"" to herself long ago? Why did it take Jade Rabbit thousands of years to create the potion to bring Houyi back?
Anyway, the music was great, the voice acting was wonderful, and I appreciated the animation a lot. I just wish the plot would have been more fleshed out."
14,Such a lovely musical movie. If you like musicals you will love this. The songs are beautiful and the animation is amazing. A lovely story for different ages to enjoy.
15,That's really an explosive eperience. This movie made my day and touched my heard. Thank u for creating such as wonderful movie
16,"This is a well written, well put together film about grief and family. Really impressed with it. Only lost a star due to the amount of tearing up."
17,"I have to admit, this caught me quite by surprise. I did not have this on my radar (which makes sense since this over the moon ... no I'm not sorry, even if you won't excuse the pun) ... but this is quite the discovery - ok I promise that was the last pun ... maybe.The movie is funnier than this though (unless you think my puns are hillarious ... than it's equal)! A family film, with pets (extra bonus for me for one of them being a bunny) and siblings ... that you love to hate ... though mostly come to realize you love. There are a lot of nice things and nice touches the movie brings you. Social messages, but also a lot of fun. A decent story about finding yourself through the search of something different ... you know, growing up and stuff. Fun for the whole family, with very good visuals"
18,Finally a Chinese movie with the right Chinese culture and values. And not another Western Chinese movie like Mulan and many others with stereotype Chinese how the Western world wants to see us. Thank you Netflix!
19,"*Huge Spoiler from the film ahead*
Over the Moon takes from every animated movie ever made (in a good way). The opening scene will remind you of Up's opening scene *spoiler warning was given lol*, the scene where the leap frogs take the girl and his friend to Lumeria reminded me of the turtles guiding Nemo and Dory in Finding Nemo, the cute animal friends will remind you of the chameleon from Tangled, the security guards on Lumeria reminded me of the Oreo guards from Wreck It Ralph, and the story with the chinese family reminded me so much of Mulan. The director has worked on so many of these beloved Disney movies so it is easy to see why. First of all I wanna say that this movie did what I just mentioned in a totally different and refreshing way. Director Glen Keane makes a spectacular animated feature film that features an all-asian cast, and it could have not been better.The first act may look visually generic, but once it gets into space boy oh boy, does it get the job done. It gets visually stunning, colorful, and joyful. I would not have this movie any other way, than with an asian cast. It is refreshing to see a chinese family in animated feature film and it worked well. I give this film an 8.5/10 rounded up to a 9."
20,"An animated adventure movie.
It is about a girl who, after losing her mother and father to find another partner, decides to undertake a trip to space to avoid forgetting her, based on all the stories they told her as a child.
Extraordinary.
Quality.
The animation is spectacular.
The feelings and emotions fully captured in the animation.
It's about feeling the pain but also when to let go, the theme is extraordinarily carried away.
How many times do we get depressed or stop living because we lost someone or because something is not as we wanted? That is explored in the movie.
A balance between drama, adventure, fantasy and tenderness.
Ideal for family viewing.
Colorful and full of magic.
The only problem is that they saturate it with songs and that comes at a time to annoy the viewer, just like in the 90s"
21,"But not at all in a good way. I am not sure what shocks me more: the movie itself or the fact that so many liked it.
The movie starts off really nicely, graphics are beautiful, songs are nice (although a bit much).
But half an hour or so into the movie it drifts off...off to the moon, off to an Alice in Wonderland ripoff that bombards your senses with illogical, psychedelic stuff and the story sort of falls apart - and lost me. Pity, really, because I adore animation movies ... well movies like the one I thought this was gonna be before Fei Fei somehow made it to the moon and the makers started smoking stuff..."
22,"I had no idea what this was going into it and honestly I am in love with this movie. I lost my sister a month ago and my dog of 10 years (who was like a child as I have no children) about 3 months prior to that. This movie was beautiful and healing. The animation was perfect and the music was wonderful. I highly recommend this, whether you're looking for a good animated film (comparable to disney) or you're trying to heal yourself."
23,"Negative reviews of Over the Moon don't seem to appreciate that the concepts of loss, death, change, depression -- the stages of mourning -- and acceptance are brilliantly conveyed in a beautifully rich, positive and creative story in Over the Moon. Beautifully presented -- with enough comic relief -- this is a great story for kids to be introduced to the concepts that they will one day face: without necessarily being conscious of it. Really enjoyed and beautifully animated."
24,That's a wonderful movie. In fact I'm going thro similar situation in my family. And it's great for my daughter to understand she's not alone. And also educate little ones about the story of Chinese Mid Autumn Day in a creative way
25,Music score animation story everything anyone could ever want in a family movie WOW
26,It's a nice story with pretty songs. And amazing sopranos.
27,"A good movie with nice songs. Sometimes sad, sometimes funny."
28,This movie started out really well but once she got to the moon it went way downhill. The story doesn't make sense and seems like it goes from one style to a completely different style. Couldn't finish it
29,The movie is about family and the moon in a different culture which is interesting to children. Highly recommend to watch with your kids.
30,"Although it's impossible this type of stunt like building rocket in that specific age,but writter is way smarter, well-written script,full of heart, great lessons to live with it..go watch it,you will not disappoint."
31,"My kids are just starting to watch movies and this was the perfect first serious movie for them to watch as they start learning a little about life. So easy to watch as the visuals are clean and stunning. Yes, the tone is very Disney and that's not a bad compliment at all. Actually, Disney needs to hire these songwriters. I felt like Frozen 2 was just a huge musical, but too dark. Knowing the backstory about the writer, Audrey Wells, and the mom character, Ruthie Ann Miles, really hit home here. This is a timeless tale for all ages. Plus, Cathy Ang hails from Cupertino! The amazing cast from Phillipa Soo, Sandra Oh, Ken Jeong, John Cho and others to Margaret Cho- Asians working in entertainment. Definitely rewatchable, too- I had to screen it before the kids. Looking forward to more like this."
32,Over The Moon was a somewhat enjoyable animated film that had some important staff that will teach kids many lessons about real life and and to appriciate staff more while we are still are having them cause they dont last forever and we found out that when its already to late to change anything.Animation was solid and it had some impressive scenes that looked very pretty .Voice acting was also pretty good and actors did a very enterteining job in the end.Story was little cliched in some ways but i didnt mind that to much.Over The Moon was a cute film that will make kids happy
33,"Fresh music, all Asian cast and a beautiful story. Over the moon was a great movie and my kids and I enjoyed every second of it. The only thing I wish is that it could of have been longer. This a much watch for the whole family!"
34,"Jokes aside, I love the media exposure to these ancient Asian stories.
I agree the building of the rocket was very forced story wise and a little introduction to how Chang'E developed her kingdom in the moon would've been helpful.
There's so much you can add in the length of a movie nowadays with so much depth behind.
I also would've prefered Chang'E's appearance to be more alienesque kind of reference to the Moonfolk/Soratami People where they were elongated pale humans with long bunny ears but you can't have everything.
OTOH Chin was straight up Crayon Chin Chan with no butt showing.... :( very cool character though."
35,"The animation was pretty good, but I didn't like most of the songs but two of them and the characters were not that entertaining.I probably won't see this again unless I was bored"
36,This is such a great movie with detailed animations and nice colors. It's pretty sad though not going to lie i cried a few times cause it really hits you in the feels
37,"A Netflix animated movie that very much follows the Disney/Pixar conventions. It's done well and with sensitivity, but it's let down by a mediocre middle section.Loosely based on a Chinese legend, it tells the story of a girl whose mother dies and has to face the possibility of his father marrying again. She is not ready to let go and accept someone else in her family, so she ends up travelling to the moon with the unwelcome company of her annoying little step-brother to find proof that the fairy tales her mother told her were real, and hopefully convince her dad to remember her mother and not marry again.The 3D animation looks quite good in the scenes set in China, with very expressive characters suiting the sentimental story being told. Once on the Moon, however, the acid-trip colors used there can't hide that the animation becomes more simplistic and cheap.It's also in that middle part where the sensitive storytelling turns into a collection of so-so animation for children tropes. The improvement of the relationship between the main character and her step-brother is explored very superficially.The songs (for this is a musical) are nice, and the resolution is satisfactory. Sure, the message here is very conventional, but then this is a movie for children, and it is with enough charm that I found it touching. It is a pity that they couldn't come up with something more special for the middle section."
38,"There's not many animated movies anymore that perfectly captivate the soul and imagination like Over the Moon. Directed by legendary animator Glenn Keane (The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Tarzan, to name a few), Over the Moon transports you to a colorful world of love and wonder.The movie starts off with a gorgeous 2D animation sequence of the Chinese Moon goddess myth, it's extremely reminiscent to the animation from classic 90s Disney films. The songs are melodic, catchy and full of heart (minus the short rap song, but even then, that song is good and fun too).By far the MOST significant and iconic part of the entire film (this scene honestly carries the entire film tbh) is when the Moon goddess, Chang'e, sings Ultraluminary in what could be described as a spectacular concert performance. The visuals are BREATHTAKING and gorgeous. It's on par with the grotto scene from The Little Mermaid (Part of Your World), the ballroom scene in Beauty and the Beast, A Whole New World, The Cicle of Life (you get the idea).. Let It Go doesn't even compare to Ultraluminary. It truly deserves a place in animation history and it would be a travesty if it isn't nominated for a Grammy.The story really pulls at the heart strings as it deals with loss and grief, something too many people are dealing with this year due to the pandemic. So if your little one is dealing with grief from losing a loved one, you may want to watch this first on your own to make sure it won't be too much for them.Sadly this movie will be slept on and invalidated by the corporate powers at Disney who desperately refuse to let go of their monopolistic grip on the animated movie industry. The hoards of Disney loyalist are also trashing this movie very unfairly, its a movie they will love to hate, thats how you know its good.Criticisms in regards to the ""logic"" of the movie kinda flew out the window when the protagonist built a rocket and literally went to the moon. It's laughable that the things these Disney loyalist are criticizing this film for they completely ignore and look the other way in their favorite films. For example Frozen was filled to the brim with plot holes and was incoherently illogical beginning to end, it was a fantasy movie anyways, but when it comes to Over the Moon, no, ""it doesn't make sense"" ok. Frozen wasn't the first movie to feature an annoying ""tag-along"" character (Olaf), there are COUNTLESS animated movies that have an annoying/endearing comic relief character, but they're all, including this one, ""ripping off Frozen"". Also Disney by far, didn't make the first animated movie to deal with death and loss (Coco). Over the Moon deals with grief much differently than Coco, I really don't understand how the comparisons to Coco are even relevant to this film.This movie is proof the Disney is destroying animation because not only do people dogmatically cling to the name ""Disney"" but their standards also stem from their movies, most of which are rip-offs of other movies and feature recycled and stolen visuals from other animated foreign films.While this movie shines on its own as a stand alone film, it really shines a light at everything wrong with Disney right now in their shadows. Their rabid cult-like fanbase refuses to let any other animated movies shine, even when they're directed by Disney legend Glenn Keane. Disney can't make an appropriate movie based off Chinese culture without bowing down to the CCP and endorsing genocide (Mulan 2020). Disney has the corporate money to pay for bad reviews to silence their competitors. Disney also decided to release a trailer for their new southeast Asian ""princess"" movie the same day Over the Moon was released. So because of the powers that be, this gorgeous film is unfairly being compared to the Emoji Movie and Trolls when in reality it's on par with the Disney classics from the 90s and their latest films (Mooana and Frozen).I highly recommend this movie, if anything at least stick around till scene when they arrive at the moon and the Moon goddess, Chang'e, sings Ultraluminary, you won't regret it."
39,"I don't think I've ever written a review but watching this movie has lifted my soul. It is such a beautiful piece of art that children will love, the real world very quickly been replaced with a bright neon world where the myths and legends of those family stories come true.A touching story that is so wonderfully told, I thought it was a beautiful thing to watch."
40,"Bravo to Netflix and the animators for giving us a movie that doesn't drag on and is not full of singing birds and overdone sweetness. Not every little girl wants to be a ""Princess"" and its ok to approach adult themes like death for kids. Great soundtrack that even parents can appreciate. PLEASE create more like this!!! Highly recommend."
41,"Still confused on what I just watched, confusing plot boring characters don't remember any of them honestly I feel like they just merged every Disney show together it's an awful confusing mess."
42,"Absolutely lovely, a must watch. Beautiful story featuring Chinese mythology, beautiful musical numbers and wonderful hidden messages. Character and relationship development is very sweet and the story will tug at your heartstrings. I watched this with low expectations on the recommendation of my 8 year old, who had watched the first five minutes at school, and it SURPASSED all expectations. 5/5"
43,"Anyone who has down rated this has no soul, or heart. This movie made me cry, and awakened in me a sense of peace. My son loves this movie. It's a wonderful beautiful movie to show the lesson of loss and how you heal from that loss. I've never seen anything more beautiful."
44,"I think as a kids movie it does a phenomenal job of adding more than just entertainment. I thought that some songs did such a good job about communicating emotions. That is not an easy thing to do, I struggle with it as an adult. I found myself chuckling away at the entire movie. I tapped my foot along with the songs. I cried silent tears during songs, happy moments, sad moments, etc. The movie was vibrant! The colors were spectacular, but unlike some random other animated kids movies where they make everything colorful, I felt like they were very tasteful. When I saw the trailer I found it all bizarre... the colors and the moon. Idk why I even wanted to watch it...? However, I am so glad I did. I am forcing my parents to watch this."
45,"So, me and my family were gonna watch The Addams Family (The new, animated one), but after about 15 minutes, we didn't like it.
This was the movie we decided to watch after that monstrosity of a movie.
Lemme just say, dazzling animation, beautiful colors, catchy songs, amazing character designs, what more could you ask for?
It gives me Disney vibes with the dead parent, the animal side-kick, the funny animal companion, songs every 15 minutes, etc.Great movie and would totally recommend!"
46,"Not enough stories with a female lead and a charming set of supportive characters can capture the attention of my 5 year old boy, but this was it. i rather enjoyed it myself. Lovely"
47,My sons liked this movie saying it has lots of characters and they liked all the songsI thought it was garbage
48,"The film is beautiful, I'll give it that. And I do enjoy the music - when we see the 'concert' that the moon goddess puts on, it's truly magical. But those are literally the only redeeming qualities of this movie. Everything is so flat, and there's no logic at all.I don't understand the timeline of why the moon goddess needs to bring back her beloved at all. Why is she running out of magic? How does that even make sense? Why in the heck does her attempt to bring her beloved back grow a forest on the moon?I don't understand her tear beings at all. Why are some of them formed and detailed and sentient, like the chickens or pangolin or flying lions, while the majority of them are formless blobs?You never learn the truth of why she's immortal and her beloved isn't. The main character and her family argue about the truth of the legend and what actually happened, but you never get any idea of it.The whole stupid vagueness of the 'gift' that the goddess expects is ridiculous. It comes out of nowhere, and it doesn't make any sense that the goddess truly has no idea what she's talking about.The growing bond between step siblings is incredibly forced. He's just annoying and inserts himself, typical rambunctious 8 year old, but the main character never seems to give him any credit so much as just put up with him."
49,"It was fun to see it, and philippa soo amazing with her beautiful voice!"
50,"The movie depicts Chinese culture in a relatable plot for people of all ages, and the themes of family, tragedy, and overcoming the past were fantastically portrayed with the songs. A great musical to me, is be one where the songs contribute to the plot, and carry the audience's emotions with the reel. Most Disney animated films don't do this, so Netflix hit gold with this one!"
51,"Ok I'll start by saying I've read some hilarious reviews about people who've watched Disney are somehow experts of this genre. I'll give in there were a few plot issues regarding immortality and the gift that may have either been a bit to basic or not explained but in these kinds of movies you can let that go as it's swimming in love, positivity and beauty, things we desperately need with what this worlds going through.I adore animated films, coco and moana are my favourites until the amazing abominable this year. Those movies rock. I loved that there were similarities with coco, moana, frozen, abominable and even angry birds, I don't mind that, things you love in any form is great.What I loved here was the colours, the imagination and the best animation I've seen, the detail was phenomenal. I get plot wise it's hard to be 100% original but there's been soooo many movies that can be forgiven, I felt the same thing when the mom passed on as I did as a child looming at bambis mom. This film filled my heart with joy and made me smile and what more can you ask?I love Asian culture so things aren't laid out like American animations, music wasn't as generically laid out for a future album it just flowed like a musical, the voices and messages were all beautiful and positive. I can't get how anyone is marking this as 1/2/3 out of 10. Maybe you need to rewatch it and find happiness in hard times.It may not be the generic Disney clone but you can love two things, Disney is all time classic and this stands along with the shreks abominables and other non Disney animations that are just a pleasureFor kids, adults or anyone having a bad dayStay safe and suspend your disbelief and enjoy a colourful beautiful ride."
52,"Absolutely stunning animation, music, songs, and beyond that, story line. My heart ached to watch it, we all loved it."
53,"I loved it! It had an amazing plot, a great motivation for the main character, and the people they meet along the way makes the perfect 10 out of 10! But there were a little confusing parts, which dropped it back down to a 9. But I still loved it and so did my family too! Awesome movie! Keep them coming Netflix/Pearl!"
54,"Very very good, with the Disney formula of
+ family
+ tragedy
+ adventure
+ fantasy
+ musical
+ emotion
the one that Pixar also knows how to use and that gave it an unequaled quality leap. Of course, the thing closes when one finds out that it is directed by Glen Keane, one of the rude ones who dipped into the best classics of the mouse company in the 2nd golden age of the company, such as The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast , Aladdin, Pocahontas, Tarzan, and then go to work at Google. In 2017, he created the short ""Dear basketball"" alongside the late Kobe Bryant, which won an Oscar the following year.
Driven by her determination and passion for science, little Fei Fei builds a rocket to travel to the moon and prove the existence of the legendary Moon Goddess Chang'e (a very popular myth in China) by discovering a world of wonderful creatures .
A lunar ""world"" in the line of beyond @coco or The Book of Life (2014), colorful, fun, pyrotechnic and meaningful. With a goddess like a popstar but not as nice as he imagined her, a younger stepbrother ready for the steps of comedies, ultra adorable little animals, millenary issues, beings as amorphous as they are colorful, a display of unbridled adventure but with a message of improvement and acceptance.
The plot becomes more important and emotional when knowing that the screenwriter Audrey Wells (The truth about cats and dogs, George de la selva, We dance?) Wrote it already knowing that she was going to die (of cancer in 2018), thinking of it as a species of legacy for his daughter, a hopeful message so that she would feel that she was there, that she would not close her heart and that she would have the freedom and decision to continue.
The musical parts have two high points, the presentation of Chang'e and hip hop playing ping pong, then the classic descriptive or emotional songs with too many highs. Visually as beautifully appealing as it is personally designed.
Known voices include John Cho (@Star Trek) as the father, Sandra Oh (@KIlling Eve) as the new mom, and Phillipa Soo (@Hamilton) as the singing goddess.
If he won the Oscar it would be more than fine."
55,"My children love this movie because of its colors and songs. But soon my daughter asked ""why always father or mother of the main character is dying?"" This is weird and don't know how to answer that.The CG work of the movie is awesome par to Disney or DreamWorks standards. I gave full 8 marks only to the Animation and Visual effects. Chang'e is rendered beautiful as I know from the Legend.Story is not that good. There are lot of missed links. Why Chin needs a Sister so badly? what is his background? How the part of the Amulet came to Step mothers possession? Why Fie Fie is chosen one? because she lost her mother and believed in Chang'e, not enough reason. Chang'e is goddess who has the ability to bring a space ship from 3 million KM to Moon, but not able to get the Amulet from the Moon surface and she needs some to find it? So many questions. It was something like I am not attached to any of the characters well.Again I am giving 8 starts to Visual Effects, Music and Songs, well rendered. Nice work. less 2 marks for Story and character bonding."
56,"Beautifully crafted, choreographed and visually impressive film. From the designs, clothing, music, camera work, focus, etc. If you are in the mood to be touched (emotionally) and watch something that might spark a smile in your face, I highly recommend that you watch this now.
In essence, it's a story about grief enveloped in a touch of Chinese culture, and elevated by the powerful emotions and love in the most important scenes.
It certainly delivered beyond my expectations with the great performances and animations! They are fast paced and filled to the brim with energy.. the way all CGI stories should be. Taking advantage of the fact they are creating a colorful world. Going beyond the constraints of reality.. just a bit.
As for the story.. It feels like a mix of things I've seen before : The touching and silent ""One Small Step"" short by TAIKO Studios. A simplified story that is quite similar to the Japanese Kaguya. The vibrant colors and style from the PIXAR's Inside Out. Etc..***********
And while I quite liked it, I feel like it was a combination of some great ideas, scenes and characters.. barely stuck together by some weaker elements/links and scenes. This movie could have been SO many different good things.
You could take a scene out of this movie (out of context), show it to someone.. and their expectations for the rest would be completely different. From the house-warming beginning, to the space-city concert, sport-duel, to the ""meeting"" in the forest near the end. In part, it lets my imagination fill in the blanks of at least 3 more stories.
And while a ""lack of identity"" hurts it a bit, the good well surpasses the bad. Still, I would have loved to experience this ""certain scene"" in a real concert-like location, and be a part of it.. would have been a memory for life. Now THAT is a way to introduce a character.. the Korean-pop idol culture feels like an inspiration.Go watch it!"
57,"Don't waste your time
Not worth it
From all the positive reviews I expected so much more from this move but alas"
58,Lots of color and sound and singing but no logic.... Very confusing... A waste of time. Has a very weak story; starts very good but the middle is completely BS. You can remove half of it... and you'll make it better actually
59,Magical from start to finish. I was surprised not to see the Disney brand on this beautiful movie.
60,My first review! Fun all the way. A bit whacky but still so much fun to be had. Enjoy it for what it is.
61,"Absolutely great. With the standards that disney and pixar has set upon heartfelt animated movies, I believe this comes on par with the greats. For me, it's better than despicable me but not as good as Frozen. Maybe on par with Moana."
62,Great movie for entire family..Great message. Loved it and kids loved it
63,"Before this film I could never sit through a musical, this movie changed everything. I loved the story and the music and visual was really beautiful. Good job!"
64,"If this wasn't released during the pandemic this could have easily been a bix hit in the theaters. We watched it last night and are watching it again right now! The colors, the music, the story, the MESSAGE! A 10 NO DOUBT!"
65,"If Disney was attached to this movie, it would have been $39.99. Awesome theme! Fantastic music!"
66,I got bored in the first 20min and complete the movie while scrolling my phone
67,"The animation is high quality but... Really disappointed by Glen Keane. I'm a huge animation lover and was looking forward to this.
The story is totally empty, the main character is fighting for something so superficial and dumb that I was shocked.
Nothing gives any feelings a all.
The moon world design is a pain in the eye.
And the songs (a million of them), oh the songs... I had to mute one some minutes before I stopped the movie halfway.
Terrible. Really a delusion."
68,"Disney is now a sickening failure of a company. They ruined Fox and Star Wars and they also continue to make pointless live-action remakes that nobody likes at all. Unlike Disney, Netflix on the other hand is doing great with their animation despite *cough* Cuties *cough*, they are still doing pretty fantastic and Netflix is getting more popular than before. Like for example, Over The Moon. I watched the film and I loved it a lot, it has a great cast, good characters, wonderfuo animation and it has some pretty amazing visuals for us to look at. And don't forget the message from the film and the song cues which made me think that Netflix is copying Disney with the song cues in Over The Moon and that's decent. Overall, Over The Moon was amazing and it is one of the best animated Netflix films ever made and people please, go watch this movie! It's so fantastic! I give Over The Moon a 9.8/10"
69,This has a repeat storyline. Like every movie that comes out these days. It's not Disney which your not expecting amazing things and don't get them. What you get is a movie that entertains your kids while your doing house work. Isn't that what kids entertainment is suppose to be.
70,"It's perfect. It's a hallmark of representation with a soundtrack that should be making it into the billboards top 100 charts. A couple of years ago it would be unfathomable that this genre was NOT Disney. How times have changed. Long live Netflix and it's animation studios, for bringing representation to all mankind where others would be too shy to do it.More about the film, it is superbly accurate in its representation of Chinese culture. Yes it's set in China but the actual setting and story can be applied to many Asian westerners. Minor misses notwithstanding (such as the fact the family will never ever entertain any animals in the kitchen), and the fact that everyone runs around the house with shoes on, apart from that it's better than Mulan live action."
71,"This is a very touching and beautiful movie.. about loss, grief, and love. One of the best animated/cgi movies I've seen in a long time."
72,"Fei Fei has a mom and father and she loves hearing stories about the moon goddess who took two immortality pills, making her go to the moon. Her love, Houyi, and her have a beautiful relationship and they stare into each other's eyes like nothing else is needed. Houyi dies and the goddess ends up having to live on the moon with just a jade rabbit.The village atmosphere is beautiful with little ponds and bridges, the Chinese outdoor stands and vendors.Fei Fei has the CUTEST purple-eyed rabbit I have seen. So cute. Along with Zootopia's.Fei Fei is at the top of her class but still believes in the so-called myth. She struggles between legend and modern science. I was just like Fei Fei when I was little as a Chinese girl...I had so many questions about the moon goddess and what became of her and how.Fei Fei is upset to see that her dad is becoming closer with a Mrs. Zhong, a potential ""replacement"" for her mother who died. She has a wild son who loves ping pong.Fei Fei uses her dad's money and buys stuff online with his permission, although he never asks what she wants to buy. She builds rockets to attempt to reach the moon.At last she has managed to do so and the rocket stops in the air, about to fall back down due to the law of gravity, but a light holds them in place.The lunarians which are lions bring them to the goddess. We see tons of colourful mooncake blobs and the goddess puts on a pop concert. The goddess wants the gift and announces she will give a wish to the person who gives her the gift first. Fei Fei just wants her photo with the goddess back and thinks the gift has to be back at where they landed.Fei Fei goes back with her new blob friend who is so cute and funny. He is the green blob who got banned for singing a song. Her mother's doll breaks down. She finds half of the jade amulet in her mooncake and realizes it is the gift.The cute rabbit follows the jade rabbit. He drops his things and she helps him to get it before it falls and breaks. He is captivated by her and she rubs her nose to his to get the pink dust on to the thing. It is the cutest scene.The goddess puts the two amulet pieces together and Houyi appears. But at last it is not for long as he tells her she must move on and he vanishes. The goddess goes into a dark depression and Fei Fei passes the wall to join her riskily. Fei Fei sees images of her and her mother and she also becomes depressed.The goddess tells her she does not belong here and she must move on. The goddess says Fei Fei was the gift. Fei Fei's bunny chooses to stay witb the jade rabbit. They make the cutest bunny couple.The lunarians bring Fei Fei and the boy back where the father is waiting. The photo destroys along the way in space.Fast forward and the dad and Mrs. Zhong have married and the family enjoy again another mooncake evening. Fei Fei now has a dog."
73,"This movie reminded me of two of my other favorite animated movies, Moana and Coco. It had the exploration of Moana with the family centered themes of Coco, as well as beautiful animation style of Coco.Where this movie separates itself is its profoundly deep tackling of death, mourning, and recovering. Moana/Coco, and some of the other greats tackle deep themes, but for Over the Moon it IS the theme throughout the entire movie, instead of a side piece of the overall journey.I cried 4 different times, it is well scripted, the songs are fun, and the animation and world building are absolutely gorgeous and feel new. For the people saying it's familiar, maybe they're right, but it's one of the best versions of familiar I've ever seen. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie."
74,"This is a beautifully made film; culturally rich, absorbing and heartfelt. The animation is as good as anything by the major Hollywood studios, the story is lovely and the songs are great. Highly recommended for the whole family."
75,"A Film that is put together with stunning animation, vibrant colours and magnificent musical numbers. It's a great story, funny and emotional, with great characters. It'll be watched again and again in the future. I definitely hope Netflix continue to on produce animated movies like this."
76,"This movie makes no sense. It lacks any true depth. Like others have commented, it starts off good, but then you are introduce to characters and plots that are completely disjointed from the heart of the message. This just goes to show you that just be you can have animation production budget doesn't mean you write a cohesive story. This movie needed a better story supervisor 😤"
77,"IIt's friday evening and all of my family is on the couch I press play and we start the movie. By each second I was wondering whats wrong with this people? What are the singing about? Why are they all still singing even when the song is over? Who wrote this? Minute after minute my mouth was bended one side, my wife fell asleep and my daughter with her nose stick in the phone. I could only stand 20 minutes and it was enough. Dull characters, strange ways of thinking, i know it's animatio but even in such movies it should a small shadow of logical approach. Without it You feel cheated by the script.
Wasted time, wasted energy. I was never so dissapointed with animation."
78,"What an incredibly beautiful film. Both in its message and how the film looks. Over the Moon is, for the most part, an incredibly generic, but easily likeable animation. Or, I should say, an animated musical.I'll start off with the stuff I wasn't so crazy about.
First, there are a few songs that felt completely out of place. They are the two more upbeat songs that take place on the moon. For some reason, this film, which for the most part is very traditional and follows Chinese norms and traditions, decided to add two songs that were just the most boring pop songs imaginable. Not only were these two songs much less enjoyable than the others, but they also completely disrupted the flow and mood of the film. I suppose these songs were made to be the hit songs of the film that would also be played on the radio. Something that seems to be quite common in newer animations.
Second, this film has, of course, a useless sidekick. However, this sidekick wasn't just completely useless, it was also rather annoying. The sidekick was only made relevant because it was something that the makers of the film clearly wanted to include. And I get that kids, who these films are mainly aimed for, like these types of goofy and funny characters that come and save the day. I just wish that a film like this could go without this type of character. Even just for once.With all that being said, it's hard to be mad at a movie like Over the Moon. It is incredibly heartfelt and the story is beautiful. The thing I most loved about this film is the visuals. It is an unbelievably stunning film. Everything from the quality of the animation, to the use of colours. From the detailed and beautiful scenery to the use of lighting. And ultimately its message. By the end of the film, you are just so happy that you end up forgetting those things that you might've not liked.In a way, these are my favourite types of movies. They are easy to watch and enjoy, and it's very likely that they will make you feel warm and happy inside. And Over the Moon is no exception. It's visually stunning and thoroughly enjoyable, despite some of its flaws."
79,"Perhaps this movie triggered emotions I rarely express and memories I have never fully addressed but this is one of the most moving films I have ever seen. Somehow the film bridges the gap between the sublime majesty of ordinary life and the heights of sparkling fantasy. The sheer beauty of the artwork and the complex interleaving and layering of art in many styles both detailed and stylistically simple was breath-taking at times. I never thought I would see an animated film that could exceed the stylistic marvel of Mowgli but this film achieves that on many levels. The pacing of the film is quick and synchronizes perfectly with the presentation of the animation and music until it slows down in the second half of the film where ironically most of the action occurs. The resolution of the plot and character arcs of Fei-fei and her brother may disappoint some people, but the constant interplay of fantastic artwork and music are good enough to setup the final act. In my interpretation of the film, it is especially tragic as I believe Fei-fei; in one version of reality; dies with her brother ;;or becomes grievously injured;; and is somehow thrust into this fantasy world ; perhaps being the spiritual landscape especially made for children and teens tragically taken too early from this world; or the compensating dream imagined by Fei-fei and her brother as they lay unconscious in the wreckage of their rocket. ;;In which case the last act might be interpreted as a supernatural landscape resembling mortal life, especially constructed ;;The fantastic characters on the moon seem to be spirit-like and even the lovable Gobi character distinctly reminds me of A.A. Milne's character of Winnie the Pooh. Also, I came to the insight that the bunny was in fact imaginary; a remnant of her attachment to the mother she grieved. I urge everyone to see this. It gets a 10 out of 10 for me; a movie built on a fantastic landscape only possible in this medium that grows more important every day."
80,"If youre ready for the next level in space exploration and astrophysics this will not disappoint. Featuring a marquee ping pong matchup that puts ping ping olympians to shame, this movie is will sure to keep you on the edge of your seat. Buckle up for a wild ride with the fluffiest and most colourful companions."
81,"I don't think it deserves the harsh criticism it's getting, I thought it was a good movie. The only problem I have with the movie is I don't understand why or how she built the rocket and flew it to space? SMH. That's way too childish in my opinion. But the rest of the movie was cool. I love the moon world thingy it reminds me of coco. And I think this world building too. Who knows we might get a sequel in the future? I recommend this movie if you have nothing else to do at the moment. 6/10"
82,"There's reviews that criticize the plot, not understanding that a musical doesn't follow the typical heroes arc. There's reviews that draw a juxtaposition between this and classic Disney movies, not understanding that classic Disney was basically just a musical that placed a higher value on plot.The production value is PHENOMENAL. Considering that this movie is a Chinese production, literally nothing was lost in translation between Chinese and English. The original music is touching and perfectly placed throughout the story. The dialogue has the trademark exposition but, keeping in mind that this movie isn't directed at adults but rather children, the exposition can't be viewed as a weakness but rather a strength.
The message is so great, the moon queen chang'e is highly symbolic, having lost someone she loved more than anything and wanted it back at all costs. Lin also shares this obstacle and they both progress past their issues by the end.
If I were to point out any weakness in this MUSICAL, it'd be how the movie had trouble sticking the landing. It felt like they tried to fit it into 1.5hrs where the movie would've been stronger with a longer run time. Overall, this is by far the best Chinese production I've ever seen. I strongly recommend it for adults and children"
83,This easily rivals the likes of disney/pixar/dreamworks. It has the escapism of kid movies of old. Highly recommend. Some fantastic songs too!
84,"I think it's the way to do a story based on Chinese Culture, is completed and have a great message."
85,"Gorgeous animation. The soundtrack has a broadway musical kind of feel to me. Definitely predictable, but in a wholesome and comforting kind of way. A refreshing step away from the usual mainstream white-centric animated entertainment."
86,"The first part of the movie was awesome! I love the CG, animations and songs were like pixar made, while watching it, i felt this could be the next blockbuster hit. Everything was perfect but how i wished they never went on the moon because this starts to ruined the whole movie.The moon glowing characters looks like an unfinished CGI work with no shadows that looks all flat they looked like a low budget cartoon network angry birds rip off . Overall moon scene color combinations were also bad. The moon characters were not interesting, i felt like turning off the tv while fei fei ang green animal were looking for the gift. Overall story was just for a tv episode.. no twist, predictable, short.Earth scene: 10/10
Moon scene 2/10
The moon ruined this movie."
87,And miserably failing.. what an incoherent story. Plot is just awful. Don't waste your time.
88,"A beautiful myth intertwined in a heartfelt story that really brought so much laughter and tears for me. There is so much meaning and the emotions were so relatable and real. I never expected to like this movie that much - it was much better than Frozen and definitely wayyy better than Frozen 2. The musical performance had tunes that I would consider worth listening to repeatedly and over the radio. A really amazing all-Asian cast and very well depicted animation of the distinctive architectural and cultural uniqueness of asia.
Highly recommend everyone to watch it"
89,"It was Amazing, Fantastic, Beautiful, Heartwarming and Musical for Best Animated Ever Had! Just like the Same thing as Disney Animated."
90,"At certain times, it feels like something is missing and it doesn't have a pretty strong plot, but its greatly animated with beautiful visuals and a good message."
91,My 2 year old was giggling and dancing. 100% enthralled in this. (Love you Dr. Ken!!) I thought this move was great. The colors. The concept. The music. All of it. 💚 and my very picky son loved it too.
92,"At first look it does very much look like a Disney movie but it's not. It has some wonderful songs in it, the animation is beautiful and the story is so touching but sad. I fully recommend watching this, I cried so much."
93,"Over The Mon is the directorial debut from Disney Animator Legend Glen Keane and features the voices of Ken Jeong. A young girl and her brother go to outer space where they track down the godess change.The animation is nice,the story was good too. The only thing I have is the songs are very forgettable."
94,I loved almost everything about it. Except for the bad pop music.
95,Heartwarming film with a good soundtrack. The story is touches your heart leaves you happy to have watched it
96,"If you have children and are able to connect to your inner-child, I would highly recommend this movie to you! My 3 and 4 year old girls love this movie! They were interacting and dancing along through out it. I thought the story was light-hearted and refreshing. The message is great and I was thankful that the villain wasn't as dark and demented as other animated films I've seen. The bad reviews I've read seem like the reviewers are judging this movie for the perspective of an adult. I believe that is a mistake. Relax and enjoy it for what it is. A kids movie!"
97,"But a sweet, beautiful and sad animation, already starts making us tear up, gets lost a little bit there on the moon, but still captivating, and the soundtrack wins my heart in these dramatic children's animations ..."
98,I loved every minute of the movie but it made me cry many times. Definitely a tear jerker. Have the tissues handy if you have experienced any loss it will pull on your heart strings.
99,"I absolutely love this movie. Some of the negative reviews I've read are so silly; yes it's a musical and yes the message is a little on the nose because it's a kid's movie. I think the story is very touching and not completely predictable. I can't understand why anyone who would start watching this movie in the first place wouldn't like it.The story is beautiful and unique with both action and heart, the voice acting is superb, characters are well developed, animation is gorgeous, and the songs are AMAZING. I've been singing the songs nonstop--I feel they are Tony award winning quality, and I am a big musical fan. I actually would love to see this turned into a live Broadway show. My whole family loves it; we've seen it 5 times already. Even my 1 and a half year old son watches parts of it."
100,Watched it with my kids and this movie is wonderful. The animation is beautiful and pairs up with the songs pretty well. There were a few scenes that remind me of Just Dance games from the game consoles.This movie has a Disney's Frozen feel and it is pretty funny and warming to watch. The characters are likeable all across (for the most part). Ken Jeong did a good job as the Gobi character.
101,"I didn't think I would enjoy watching this movie as much as I did!! Definitely worth watching, it's now one of my favorites!"
102,"Strong beginning, strong ending, strong story but the middle of the movie was very odd. A great story about life and death taught in a simple And fun way for children to learn about the loss of a loved one. Not sure if I missed some cultural design/animation/stylized things because I just didn't like the space world they portrayed. Personal opinions aside, this was a decent to good movie which unfortunately could have been great."
103,"I was looking at the reviews b4 I reached the halfway mark and I didn't get it but now I get it.The stars for the animation, especially the gorgeous scene in the beginning with the story of chang'e and houyi, the emotion i felt when the mom was around, and the voice acting.
It is hollow. The emotional moments don't pay off like they should bc the build up isn't there. It was like it skipped to the good bits without taking the time to establish why they should be good.Fei fei and chin's relationship doesn't make sense. I get chin wanting to impress her and want to be close bc clearly his mother took the time to explain to him what was going on but he didn't do anything to earn fei fei's affection! Sure he deserves it but as far as she's aware he didn't do anything?? It doesn't make sense to go from hating him to thinking he's her little brother when they were actually separated for the whole movie!!!! Like she never really saw him to anything for her besides the thing at the end but really at that point chang'e was the one doing the emotional lifting there.The dad sucks, why wouldn't he tell his daughter he was getting remarried much less tell her he was even seeing someone?? Instead of being like, here's a random stranger, guess what, she's ur step mom now! Is this a cultural thing?? I mean that doesn't mean it sucks less but it means that he wasn't being a straight jerk to his daughter.Why would the bunny stay?? There was nothing tying her there! The male rabbit was not remotely enough to justify her wanting to stay over going back home!I feel like it would have been stronger if fei fei connected the parallels between houyi and her mom by herself instead of it being shown but not stated by the characters."
104,"The story is bland and just so random, the characters lack depth and honestly the best thing about this movie is that the bunny is only mildly annoying and looks VERY cute.There is no interesting story at all, stuff just happens and it's colourful."
105,"Typical story about a tween girl with parents that the mother passes away within the first 10 minutes and the dad finds a new girlfriend, which the tween girl is rebellious to.The story seems to be a knockoff on Frozen but has multiple Olafs and multiple, multiple other knockoff characters too, and Minions! Its just trying too hard.Defies way too many physical properties...The tween flies to the moon on a homemade rocket to prove her mom was telling the truth during the little girl's bedtime stories about the lady on the moon.Eventually she realizes there is no need to prove anything and at the same time mentally matures...Frankly, no need for you to watch.
Extremely colorful, so it might keep a toddler from crying for an hour and a half. But that's about it.For review purposes, I watched the original English audio with Japanese subtitles and the dubbed Japanese audio with English subtitles.Localization comments;
The Japanese localization team didn't count crabs with the correct units in the dubbed Japanese. Typical mistake, but if it's trying to be a children's show, it should also be educationally accurate.The localization team did a really good job with the songs lyrics and singing parts in Japanese. Better singers in Japanese than in English.And I guess they didn't localize the lip movement to the other languages either."
106,"Pros:
Really gorgeous animation, would love to see more movies use this animation styleCons:
EVERYTHING ELSEA thin plot where things just happens for the sake of happening and because the story asks for it. The protagonist's struggle feels so artificial and she breaks into Elsa/Moana type of song of struggle every 5 minutes.
Most reviews have praised the movie but cannot find any reason besides animation for appraisal. Animation alone couldn't carry this film"
107,Some people liked the songs and I just felt like that was really all there was to it. Its a weird story that doesn't make any sense. The songs aren't fun. They are all about adult or teenage things but the animation is clearly made for babies. Fei fei needs a picture of the goddess to prove to her dad that he shouldn't move on for no logical reason. Chang'e teleports the girl to the moon for no reason. Chang'e demands a gift for a picture for no reason. Then magically the gift they were searching for is in her bag for literally no logical reason. Everything just happens when it needs to for no real reason. My kids were bored because all it was where flashing bright colors with all the elements just happening. She also gets a laughable amount of rail for her ship like 20 miles of rail and magnets is something that a kid could buy off the internet with 20 miles of space for the kid to set up her ship inside a city. Overall nothing made sense and things just happen because the story wants it to.
108,Just boring. Even my 8 and 6 yr olds were bored watching it.
109,"""Can you see what nobody sees?""We've seen a decline is animated musical these past few years. It seemed that every animated movie coming out had to be a musical but now not so much. Over the Moon attempts at reviving the animated musical genre. Now it may not live up to some of the prime examples, but it does have a fair amount to offer. Firstly, the animation is really beautiful. There are moments that look realistic. I'd compare it to Toy Story 4. The characters don't look too realistic but the details in their surroundings enhance it. When they get to the moon everything changes to a more vibrant, neon tone. The animation is in its prime their. Secondly, the voice acting is great. Cathy Ang as Fei Fei felt all so natural. And I'm glad she sang her own songs. This will definitely kickstart her career. Everyone just fit their character well. The vocals are all pretty good as well. Thirdly, there's a couple songs that worked well. Notably, Rocket to the Moon has the most meaning and the best writing of them all. This is the song I'm sure will be up for best original song. Overall, quite a few achievements with the movie.Where I find the most issues is in the writing. The beginning sets up to be a fun movie. There is good writing and a story that is so far so good. Surprisingly it's when they get to the moon where it lost me. The story aims to be for younger audiences mainly then. I hoped for something that all ages could appreciate. I'm sure there are many people who felt differently but I saw something else. The story simplified too much for me and a good amount of interest was lost. Plus the songs just didn't do it for me anymore. Everything just becomes too cliche. It's not the worst thing but I expected so much more from all of the hype and anticipation. After almost two weeks I don't remember a whole lot that happened. A rewatch might help. Over the Moon takes off well, finds itself for a bumpy ride, but does manage to stick the landing."
110,"The movie starts off really well. My kids and myself hooked in, but the movie changes as soon as the moon landing. My kids and myself lose interest, not sure what's going on, couldn't finish it, that's how bad it gets."
111,Good story line and everything but the animation is not that really good but it's okay
112,"It's a Netflix production and it's like they combined Mulan, Frozen, Coco and Sing into one movie. Which is fine, but a little much."
113,"The storyline, design, songs, and animation was amazing but scenes like the goddess' concert should've gotten some better camera shots."
114,"A masterpiece full of metaphors for my delight, in addition to having a fascinating visual that I regret not having seen before, when this movie was released. The cartoonish part bothered me, but it is just a thing of mine."
115,Girl's mom dies at the beginning. Dealing with dad's girlfriend and ultimate marriage and potential step brother. Call me old fashioned but I'm not a fan of remarrying when you have kids. It's an ultimate betrayal.
116,"This movie was a masterpiece, worthy of Disney! The characters are relatable, and the story is fun and touching. The music is phenomenal! Please make more!"
117,"For those who have been through or going through the journey, this movie will touch your heart. It will unveil what is beyond the understanding of what our mind is able to comprehend. May this message and story reach those who needs the message and love from our deceased...they are around us. Love us around us...let it go, let it flow...💕💕💕"
118,"As other reviews note, what is the message here. The whole story gets lost in the zany space story. Kids blowing up dangerous rockets, breaking rules, meeting space monsters... They spend the first part of the movie trying to perfectly imitate culture of mainland China, then they go to absurdism with the moon/space characters and story. Our 6-year old found it visually stunning, but she asked a lot of questions that just make this a BAD film. Why are they allowed to shoot rockets? Why did their space ship crash? Are they hurt? Why are they needing space suits and then not needing them? Is it real or a dream? Why do they keep speaking different languages back and forth? The relationship stories are also too mature for the cartoonish characters and for kids. This film is lost in space. Go watch a Pixar film instead. Those are the real deal. This is a bad knock-off. Like that cheap cereal on the bottom shelf at the stores. Avoid!"
119,"There were some areas where the characters could have been developed more (because they were interesting, but I feel like we didn't get enough screen time with any of them to care enough, idk), but the main character is someone I really connected with for some reason? Because oh my god this movie hit all of the emotions for me. I cried at the beginning, I cried in the middle, and I cried at the end.This movie tackles things like grief and dealing with the loss of a loved one, loneliness, and love. The music was fun and the animation was beautiful. As an asian person I loved seeing an all asian cast and I enjoyed the representation! If I had grown up with more stories like this it would have been great. I'm glad my brother gets to see things like this.It's a bit cheesy and some of the metaphors are very very obvious and sort of shoved into your face, but there are elements that are more subtle as well, so I feel like it's a healthy balance.This movie is absolutely beautiful, sad at times, has wonderful music, and I would definitely rewatch it again. I really really enjoyed it. It's a good movie for people of any age, and it has something good to offer for everybody."
120,"This animation is a typical rendition of how a Chinese looks like in the eyes of Americans. Characters have round face, sharp tailed eyes, flat nose and a big chin. There are many erroneous details for example. they rolled the mooncake skin which was never needed. Looks like they are making dumpling instead. And they bake the mooncake in a steamer. They put plate full of oranges to pray the dead mother. Oranges symbolizes lucky and success which has no place on a altar for the dead.The characters are not build up correctly and many things are unexplained. Why the rabbit has a relationship with the little brother and choses him instead of Fei Fei. How Chang Ee became so vain and materialistic? The movies seems to portray Chang Ee as if she is schizophrenia. Why Houyi sudden appear and have to leave etc etc. Its a very careless production in my opinion."
121,Enjoyed the movie and songs. Better than the recent movies from Disney
122,"I really wish I had enjoyed this one more, because as a Chinese person, I enjoyed seeing so many familiar cultural elements. Additionally, Chinese mythology is very rich and underutilized by the animation industry (outside of the Chinese market itself, of course), so seeing a reimagining of what Chang'e's fate would be so many years after her exile to the moon sounded interesting but didn't quite live up to what it could have been.The character design is appealing and like many others have said, it starts out strong emotionally, but as soon as they get to the moon it starts to fall apart. First off, the design of Lunaria is really hard to look at. There are so many motifs of Chinese architecture and design that could have been used instead of oversimplified brightly-coloured blobs, so I felt somewhat let down when the design for moon queen Chang'e's realm was so generic and without identity. I'm not saying every Chinese production has to be overtly, stereotypically Chinese, but I think most people would agree with me when I say that the outside of Lunaria was just exceptionally ugly and unmemorable. Whenever comparisons are made to Disney properties, I find they're not always being made fairly. Disney is a gigantic, rich company with nigh endless resources, and these are comparatively smaller studios. However, I do see the merit in comparing this movie to Coco. Both have themes of grief and familial bonds, and both eventually take place in a fictitious reconstruction of a legend from their respective cultures. When you look at the two settings of Lunaria and Coco's Land of the Forgotten, you can tell that a lot of love for Mexican culture and research went into the construction of the latter while Over the Moon took a much simpler and impersonal approach. Considering how authentic and life-like Feifei's real-world hometown is, Lunaria felt very artificial and almost like it belonged in a different movie.Putting my grievances with the setting design aside (because I could go on forever), the plot may be generic, but I don't believe generic plots are inherently bad. A cliche done well can be very enjoyable. However, while this plot did tug at my heartstrings at times, there were too many plot contrivances that had to be made in order for many major events to happen -- why was the gift hidden in a mooncake? -- and this kind of took away from the impact of these events. Perhaps if they had framed the whole moon trip more as a dream, like if they had shown the children waking up in the crash site of Feifei's homemade rocket, the audience would be lead to believe that these things did not literally happen and were all symbolic -- in fact, I think this was meant to be the case as Mrs. Zhong has Chang'e's full amulet at the end of the movie, but it was left just a little too unexplained for us to make the connection ourselves. Why Feifei goes to the moon in the first place is a bit of a stretch -- proving Chang'e as real will make her dad remember her mom? My mother and I were both confused about this, and we had to talk it through to figure out why Feifei was even going to the moon. I think it would have worked better if it had been framed as Feifei, in her grief, wanting to abandon her family altogether by running into the arms of a fairytale her mother used to tell to her.Unlike many others, I don't mind the ambiguity of why Chang'e took the two immortality pills. It leaves you wondering, and I think they left this area ambiguous on purpose because each Chinese kid has been told a different version of the myth. I feel like if they had poked fun at this ambiguity itself once on the moon it would have felt less like a question that was meant to be answered and more like a conscious choice.As others mentioned, the emotional arcs felt rushed overall and the characters of Feifei and Chin didn't seem to get along in the end because of their experiences but because the plot said for them to. The father, who should have played a larger role in this grieving arc, didn't have any development or change at all.I've already rambled for too long, but despite its flaws, I thought the vocals were very beautiful. The songs could have been more memorable if used sparingly, because there were seriously so many songs. I didn't enjoy the insertion of pop culture into the Chang'e song sequences but I think it worked for what they were trying to communicate -- perhaps her loss of identity as a result of her grief and solitude. Animation was solid, and if more love was put into this project, it could have been much better. But at the end of the day, young children will likely enjoy this movie far more than teens or parents."
123,"I like culture but when it's based on such a weak narrative it becomes unbearable. Although, the whole production was great."
124,"The first part had me laughing a lot at the subtle reactions to the relationships.
The second part at the moon could be improved a bit but was still fun enough.
Loved the pop star part. Catchy."
125,"Right, well when I sat down to watch the 2020 animated movie ""Over the Moon"" I wasn't really expecting much from it. Why? Well, I hadn't really heard about it, and I had just casually browsed through it a couple of times whilst perusing the contents of Netflix. But I eventually opted to sit down and watch it.And I must say wow. This animated movie was spectacular, and if you are only watching one animated movie of 2020, you should definitely sit down to watch ""Over the Moon"".The storyline told in ""Over the Moon"" was one that held a lot of aspects to it, lots of different layers of the storyline to explore, so I will say that there is something for just about everyone in the audience sitting down to watch ""Over the Moon"", be they young or old.Aside from having a moving and entertaining storyline, then the animated movie was just spectacularly beautiful to sit through. Visually it was very pleasing for the eyes. I really liked the art style they opted to use in ""Over the Moon"", because it really complimented the storyline quite a lot. And the level of details and attention to details in every scene was just spectacular. I really liked how they managed to give the characters life and unique characteristics. I mean, for an animated movie, then ""Over the Moon"" really stood out as being not only memorable, but also beautiful.With this being an animated movie, you are in for an excessive amount of singing as well. Which is something that I could have been without. Sure, there tend to be singing in a lot of animated movies, but it is just not something I am a fan of. And it was gnawing at me as I sat through ""Over the Moon"".For me, ""Over the Moon"" was definitely one of the most memorable movie experiences to make it to the screen in 2020. If you enjoy animated movies, then I can warmly recommend that you find the time to sit down and watch ""Over the Moon"", be it alone, with your loved one, or with the family, as there is something for everyone to enjoy here. This is also an animated movie that has enough contents to be watched more than once.My rating of ""Over the Moon"" settles on a well-deserved eight out of ten stars - or moons! Get it?"
126,"The issue with this movie is that it feels so familiar to almost every other Disney movie out there which isn't a bad thing if it was released during the 90's during the Disney Renaissance. Since it was released in the present day, it's hard for the film to distinguish itself from other animated films but there is one way that it does, the animation. If there is one thing that you should take away from this film, it's that the animation is beautiful. It looks so crisp, clean, and vibrant that it's hard for a viewer to take their eyes off of it. Unfortunately, I think this is all this film will be remembered for. The story isn't unique. It's a good story about learning to let go and accept change but we've seen those themes and story beats so many times that they don't hit as hard if it's not used properly. This is a musical and most of the songs were okay. There were 2 that I enjoyed though and they worked great for the film especially the last song. In fact, the last 25 minutes of this film are great. It's emotional beats it and the story wraps up nicely but the other hour and 20 minutes are decent. The voice acting is fine. There isn't a great performance and there isn't a terrible one either. However, this film resorts to the use of a sidekick and my god is he annoying. I couldn't stand him at all. Every scene he was in, he ground the film to a halt. The worst part is is that it's voiced by an actor that I do enjoy and is funny, Ken Jeong. I just don't know what he was doing here though. If you enjoy animated films, then go check this out but don't expect something incredibly original."
127,"The movie, The animation and the writing is really good i felt every word in it every song, it was amazing, it warm your heart from the inside."
128,"To preface this: I thought the movie was actually not bad. It was heartwarming and the general idea of the plot was good.First: Plot. Yes, I know they had to bring something new to the movie, but the plot was simply strange. A girl goes to the moon to prove to her father that a goddess is real so he won't get married again? It seemed like a mishmash of strange elements. Also, the ping pong match was super random, although the action of that scene was GREAT, even if Chin was in it.Second: Songs. The songs were simply not good. They were rather unmemorable and the lyrics were kind of bad. ""Hey Chang'e, I am coming to you""? Really? Was that the best you could do?Third: Characters. Bungee the rabbit was quite adorable and Jade Rabbit was good too, but Chin was extremely annoying. Chang'e was a good character, but the popstar part was right out of left field. Fei Fei was a sympathetic character, and so was Gobi, but the other characters apart from Fei Fei, Gobi, and Jade Rabbit were varying degrees of bland, especially Houyi, who has a total of about five lines.Fourth: Animation. The animation of the movie was absolutely beautiful, but a few things seemed strange, such as a lot of walk cycles being a little strange and kind of funky.Fifth: Logical errors. First one right out of the gate: Yes, I know it's a movie, but the sequence with the giant frogs made no sense. The moon has low gravity, not zero gravity, so the frogs shouldn't have been hovering. Also, some walk cycles (in fact, all of them outside of Lunaria) should have been a lot...floatier, beacuse of the gravity. That could have lead to some great sequences with a character leaping high in the air with Earth behind them. In fact, the movie seems to remember this only when it wants to. In addition, Fei Fei, Chin, and the frog should have been dead the moment they lost their helmets. The frog should have been dead before, since it was just in Chin's pocket, and he didn't have a spacesuit. Also, where did the space suits come from?In conclusion: This movie was all right. There were a few odd bits,but the general idea shines through. Would I recommend you watch this movie? Yes, definitely. Would I recommend you watch it again? Maybe. More than twice? you could find better things to do with your time."
129,"This film is solid. I especially love the setting when fei fei arriving the lunar palace, and the whole thing has the studio.ghibli vibe. The chongs singing at the beginning remind me of one of the scene at Macross Plus, which is great. The story is lovely base on a Chinese folks tale and its welcoming to see a new interpretation of the story and the message behind it!! Solid 10/10"
130,"When a young girl, who grows up helping her mother and father make moon cakes for the moon festival, loses her mother.She dreams that she has become the Chinese moon Goddess Chang'e, who is stuck on the moon, with the Jade Rabbit, as he mixes his elixir of immortality.Chang'e was whisked away to the moon after being attacked by thieves, while her beloved Houyi was off fighting demons with his bow and arrow.With her mother gone, she imagines that she is on the moon, like Chang'e, awaiting the arrival of her father, who remains stuck with her down on Earth.So, when her father takes on a new fiancee, and she gets a little step brother, she starts to think he has forgotten about her.Thus, she plans to construct a rocket ship to take her-and her pet rabbit Bungee- to the moon, so that she can prove to her family that Chang'e, and her myth, are real.In order to do this, she uses the electro-magnetic technology of the bullet train, to get the necessary speed she'll need to shoot herself out of the Earth's atmosphere.But when she succeeds in this endeavour, and sets her plan into motion, she fails to compensate for the excess weight of her stepbrother, and his pet frog, who have stowed away on the ship.Luckily for them, however, a couple of space lions intervene...in order to help them get to the moon.After which they take them to Chang'e's magical castle in the sky...where they are greeted by talking moon cakes.Now, she must find ""the gift""- which is hidden somewhere on the moon- in order to get the evidence she needs, and her wish granted by Chang'e.So she teams up with a group of lunarian biker chickens- and a bioluminescent mole- while her step brother and their pets try to convince Chang'e to give them the evidence...so he can prove to her that he's a good brother.And though it takes a few trials and tribulations, she helps Chang'e locate her mysterious gift.Learning that the real gift in life is family, in the process.Even if the nature of that family changes over time.And it takes some letting go to accept that.It's all such a magical, musical, mystical, and moving, psychedelic adventure into the mythical.And a journey that you won't want to miss sharing with your kids, and loved ones.But be warned...it might bring tears of joy and happiness to your eyes.As you are left reflecting on what those who are close to you truly mean in your life.Pure magic.Plain and simple.8 out of 10."
131,"I went looking for this movie because of John Cho and Sandra Oh. They don't have particularly big roles, but I'm glad I found it anyway. Anyone who's complaining about the music and singing clearly hasn't watched a lot of animation over the past years; kids are going to love this one.The animation was outstanding and reminded me a lot of Home and Moana (maybe it's the big eyes). Fei Fei wasn't the easiest character to like, especially the way she treated Mrs Zhong and Chin (to be fair, he was rather annoying, but I guess that's what some kids do); but she had her moments. Especially once they got to the moon, and the adventure really kicked off.Yes, there were a few things that made no sense - and can people PLEASE stop running around with vitally important objects clutched in their hands instead of tucked away in a pocket or bag? - but I was willing to overlook them because honestly - fantasy.All in all, a visual feast, wonderful representation, lovely singing, a fair amount of both humour and pathos, decent scripting. Very enjoyable and worth watching again."
132,"Watched w one of my daughters last night. Just a great story for the ages w distinct Chinese cultural ""mythology"" and Moon Festival traditions. Transcends spiritual belief to demonstrate the power of love!!Grab a box of tissues (for my daughter, of course) .... actually will touch everyone who have loved, and lost, and love again!"
133,"Too little time too fall in love with the characters. The little boy, the rabbit. Too much going on. Animation is lovely."
134,"(minor abstract spoilers)A movie like this is easy to mess up. The parts that are supposed to make you feel might leave you cold, the switch between realistic and magical might feel forced, the challenges and the methods of overcoming them may seem random, the music may be bad and the touchy endings can be cringy. But over three moon did all of it amazingly!Having lived in China for a while myself, I found it beautiful to recognize so many things from there, showing that it was created together with people from China, rather than just westerners who read about the culture. I bawled my eyes out near the end and loved the resolve, even though it could be considered predictable or cliche, it's an important life lesson to everyone, young and old.I wish more studios would take on Disney to create beautiful animated musicals like this - the medium truly allows for wondrous settings and heartfelt moments with fantastical creatures. I might prefer drawings over 3d animation, but if movies like Moana and this keep coming out, sign me up."
135,"A beautiful film and I enjoyed every second of it. I loved the music, characters. I can't wait to watch it again!"
136,I knew nothing of this movie going in. My 8 year old little brother actually suggested I watch it. It was absolutely stunning. And it was a bonus for me not knowing that it was a musical. The songs are incredible and the story is heart warming and full of wonderful family sentiment. Would recommend!
137,Was a very heartfelt movie it shows how grieving can affect a young person perfectly and that it's okay to move on cause they are always with us! The soundtrack is perfect
138,"It became weird after 20 minutes, boring, nonsense:( I have impression my 5yo was into it because of crazy colors and songs. After 50 minutes I proposed to pause and she was absolutely fine with it."
139,Some writers should stop smoking crack. It feels like the 2nd half was created by a different team. First half is great then it goes to hell...
140,"For me, it didn't even ""start off well"". It was ok but way too boring. And then just dumb. I stopped at the moon and had already fast forwarded the 'rocket building' montage. And there was singing..."
141,"The plot was amazing but the whole thing with the mother dying is too old and the kid cry the whole movie about it was unnecessary, I dunno I just didn't like it too much"
142,"Really liked Moana for comparison. Asked my adult sister before watching this if it was as good as Moana just because I apparently reference how good a movie is based off of that one. She said she thought it was better.I'll be honest. I hated this movie. I am iffy on musicals in general, but I like more or less all of the disney classics and a lot of the more recent ones. I thought the songs felt unnaturally placed until we got to the very end (and I thought the ending was the only decent part). I thought the main characters were less than compelling. It felt predictable in the most boring ways. It got really weird in the middle and then all of these annoying characters were introduced.Let me reiterate that I like pretty much every pixar/disney animated movie I've seen, which is a ton, and I despised this movie. If you don't necessarily love musicals you may feel similarly. I was hiding under a blanket about halfway through because I couldn't take it and felt like I was going mad. But my dad of all people was enjoying it so we kept going.I've having PTSD just typing this, I fully regret it. Sister, why did you recommend this to me. Why have you forsaken me."
143,"There is no substance in this movie. I thought the goddess was a ""good guy"" at first but made me think she ended up being the villain? Which I thought was cool, but no. She's just a rude, selfish, ""good"" character that has a good singing voice and cool animation! Not a good example that's for sure. Not that I care, but if parents are strict about that then this is not the type of movie. Fei Fei is also a ridiculous example to follow now that I'm on the subject. Making a spaceship with fireworks? I mean I know it's just a make-believe kids movie but still. It was a little cringey I just gotta say. If magic is gonna be the way she eventually gets there...they should've just stuck with that idea from the beginning. What also bothered me was the assumption that the viewer knows about this moon goddess legend. It was beyond confusing so I had to google if it was actually a well known myth or some random story scripted for $. Finally, the worst part of this movie was the goddess telling Fei Fei to get her ""the gift"" omg! Like seriously? She literally gives NO DIRECTION, NO DETAILS, NOTHING about what the ""gift"" is that MUST be brought to her immediately. If she needed something that bad and that fast (or else her life is over for eternity or whatever) then wouldn't she either give specifics on what to find or where? It wouldn't ruin the movie...all that could be done differently would be a fun hunting/scavenger type adventure with other fun fillers and it would've been more enjoyable. I know I said that was the worst part but I forgot about the ending...don't even get me started lol
I still recommend to watch; no idea why though. I guess you just gotta see this to believe it. Why waste such great actors and animation abilities plus score for this wasteful story arc???? Whyyyyy Netflix whyyyy?!?! And people are comparing this to Disney?! Oh my. Not even close in my opinion. (Yes this is all just my own opinion so calm down) :)"
144,"This film is riddled with plotholes and chinese culture was completely butchered. This film carries takes on a more Korean approach than a Chinese approach. Just when 2020 couldn't get any worse, a film seemingly directed by a child is released. Do not watch this film unless you want to have a misconception of Chinese culture."
145,"Glen Keane is one of the most celebrated animators of the modern age for his dynamic character performances and experimental draftsmanship from Disney onward. Given his recent track record of acclaimed short films such as Duet and Dear Basketball, it was only a matter of time before he would make his own feature soon. That chance has finally arrived with the recent Netflix flick Over the Moon, a Chinese-co production from Pearl Studio. As of late, it's been getting some fairly decent reviews, although not on the level of Klaus. Maybe part of it could be its not what I would call a smash hit narrative wise.The film centers around a little girl named Fei Fei who builds a rocket ship to travel to the moon in search of the mystical goddess Chang'e to prove her existence to her family. Although that premise does sound intriguing, the movie's plot is fairly predictable and routine as the same old musical adventure fantasy from past Disney movies where the young child protagonist seeks the unknown on an epic quest. One would imagine this could have gone in a more dramatic direction given the themes of losing a loved one and needing to move on, but for some reason, the film would rather utilize genetic tropes instead, like the annoying comedic sidekicks, the Macguffin needing to be searched, the protagonist's low point during the climax, etc. The movie at no point distinguishes itself from past Disney or Pixar formulas to really take off as much as it should have, not helped when it deals with the loss of a parent. Given Glen Keane's break away from the Disney regime, one could imagine he could have given the film's story more momentum, and yet he still chose to do the obvious choice.However, for all of the movie's shortcomings, what does save it from being ultimately forgettable is the moon goddess Chang'e and her own personal arc. Whenever the movie focuses on her narrative as opposed to Fei Fei, that's when it becomes heartfelt and even somewhat deep. As an ancient figure who had long awaited the return of her true love, her desire for a gift from someone, be it Fei Fei or anyone else, is slowly revealed as the movie reaches its second half. Even though the movie's attempts at comforting grief aren't as strong as the best children's stories out there, the breaking point of Chang'e towards the climax and resolution is pretty much the glue that held the entire heart together. One could only wish the rest of the movie was as tender as this moment instead of being hyped up on energy throughout its quest, but at least this plot point makes for a strong contrast. Even the actual ending wraps the story up well enough to make all those reasonings for Chang'e's sadness worth Fei Fei learning to move on in her life.Now being Glen Keane's directorial debut, it is fascinating to see him transition into CGI as smoothly as he did back at Disney in the last decade. The character designs and animation are of the usual caricatured aesthetic from other Disney films in recent years, but the movie is at its most creative design-wise when we actually get to the moon given all the bizarre creatures and aliens around Chang'e's kingdom. Perhaps the art direction could have used a little less polish, since even with the bright shiny color scheme around the moon, the sets and effects can sometimes feel too colorful for their own good. For every specified detail around the moon, these overly colorful designs just don't work well in contrast with the bleak outer space. Musical-wise, some of the songs are typical diet-Disney retreads, with Mooncakes and Rocket to the Moon feeling like they belong in the rejected Frozen garbage can, but others have a fascinating tempo like Ultraluminary and Hey Boy. It's weird when a soundtrack becomes a mixed bag of squeaky clean Broadway and actual experimental efforts.So in the end, despite it's best efforts and sympathetic antagonist, Over the Moon was a disappointing letdown from Netflix and Glen Keane given its weak story, generic characters and overly simplified art direction. Unless you're a fan of Keane's work or into diet-Disney clones, this isn't really worth recommending compared to Netflix's more impressive animation catalog. In a day and age where people have become far more distressed from recent global events, this film ends up as a failed fable in processing the grief we have now; it's all sparkle and no value."
146,"GRADE: C+THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Flawed animated fantasy that is too formulaic for its own good.JIM'S REVIEW: I wasn't too Over the Moon for the latest Disney animated effort despite my high regard due for one of the studio's major talents helming this project, Glen Keane. His legendary animation prowess can be seen in many of Disney's earlier classic films like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin. This is his first director role in a feature length animated film (with an assist by John Kahrs) and the results are decidedly mixed. With much on view to admire, the flaws outweigh the assets. The film's major problems are threefold: an uninspired screenplay, a ghastly music score, and some garish visuals. Let's examine each factor.First, the script by Audrey Wells, Alice Wu, and Jennifer Yee McDevitt hews too closely to the formula of most Disney fare. It lacks the courage and insight to boldly go where others may not travel. The story has its young heroine, Fei Fei (fine voiceover work by Cathy Ang) unable to accept the remarriage of her father and dreaming of escaping the real world and finding her idol, the mythical goddess Chang'e, who lives on the moon and pines for her lost love. Building a rocket she, her pet bunny Bungee, and a stowaway future stepbrother, Chin, journey to a new world. This trio land on the b&w lunar surface and are soon transported to a Technicolor utopia. You just may shout out, ""Surrender Dorothy!"" at that point as the trio is sent on a mission from the ""Wizard"" Chang'e to find a gift to aid in her sorrows.There are other rather obvious inspirations or rifts from the Disney vault throughout the movie. An overload, in fact: the death of parent or loved one (Bambi, Up, The Lion King, Finding Nemo), diva villains (The Little Mermaid, Frozen, 101 Dalmatians), silly sidekicks (Frozen, The Jungle Book, Dumbo, Aladdin, Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, The Lion King, etc.) and multicultural source references (Coco, Pocahontas, Moana, Brave, Mulan) The ethnic cleansing in its roster of princesses continues once again in this movie. Why, we even go down a cosmic rabbit hole before it's too late! The lack of originality undoes much of the film's sense of wonder and shows the major shortcoming of this whole enterprise. Formulaic storytelling never equals innovation.Secondly, the songs by Helen Park, Christopher Curtis, and Majorie Huffield are downright bad. The lyrics are K-pop derivative dreck and wouldn't know a rhyme or a reason. Fortunately, they are usually voiced by Phillipa Soo who makes any tune palatial. Their inclusion to the film rarely enhances the mood. They are all forgettable at best.The last gaping misstep can be found in some of the tacky world of Lunaria, where most of the film takes place. Crass neon colors and intense illuminating effects give this universe an artificiality and unnecessary flatness. This world, seen as a spacey rock concert with its miscast Munchkin citizenry lacks details and the Biker Chicks sequence look like Angry Bird rip-offs. Except for the strong character design of Chang'e, Fei Fei, and Jasper the Rabbit, other characters are either too cutesy, too stereotypical, or too annoying like comic relief glob, Gobi (Ken Jeong). Strangely, when the film is earthbound, as in the first half hour, the animation is quite lovely. When it goes astral, it gets lost in space. Or you begin to feel trapped in some bizarre arcade game.Avoiding movie theaters (which seems the fate nowadays for many film releases), this direct-to-streaming family movie has its merits too. Voiceover work by its Asian cast is charming. At times, the animation is top-notch: the aforementioned Chinese village scenes, an action-packed chase sequence involving a doll, the poetic State of Sadness sequence with its toned-down hues, and the film's early highlight, an exquisite hand-drawn retelling of the Chang'e legend which only hints at what could have been great if less time was spent on computer generated imagery and more on the human touch.Perhaps that is what truly is missing here. With all the gifted artisans from the Disney Studios, Over the Moon overshoots its trajectory and never really lands."
147,"Its a very surface level movie. no major twists or dillema's. but no movie has to be all that, so what were left with is a good movie with some pretty visuals and a clear message. you could see it a monotone, but simplisity isnt a bad thing.6/10: ok"
148,"Typically western-style animation, trailer always looks great. Can't wait to watch it, but after watching it, feels like another two hours wasted. The way it tells this story is too familiar, almost boring."
149,"This was real shame.. Little girl is not cute, she tries to be but failed.. Story is irrelevant.. Musical part was unnecessary.. I don't know for whom they are making this, adult brain can't digest this.. Kids can't digest this either. Who. Wasted whole efforts.."
