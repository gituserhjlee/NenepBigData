If you liked Delhi Belly this one's perfect for you"
1,This movie feels like a movie made on international level yet feels absolutely indian. A movie that has the best of both indian cinema and international cinema. Nearly every actor shines in their respective role. Even Abhishek Bachchan feels good. Most people calling it HinduPhobic are just plain dumb. They want movies to be made in India but don't want them to show indian culture from any perspective. Watch it and judge. It's a 7 out 10 for me. But I'm giving it 10 as I don't feel we should undermine a great effort just because people think it's a nepo product or hindu phobic.
2,The film just starts from somewhere just like a Tarantino film with no real early insight on what is happening . We are slowly given birth to its world and what is really special about its film is its execution . The execution is unique and it keeps you hooked to the story . The film is rightly named as Ludo as it shows so many parallels with the board game . The ending scene of the film is extremely symbolic if you think about it . Pankaj Tripathi is just phenomenal in his role . He is calm minded yet violent and thats what i liked so much about the character. His character is much like Bob Biswas in Kahaani . Rajkumar Rao is as usual fabulous with his acting and the female leads did put forth commendable performances . Abhishek Bachchan is truly a gem for Indian cinema ... He has so much potential but yeah he shouldn't be compared with his father cause he is so much different .. overall the film is really good and unique with superb direction from Anurag Basu . Probably one of the best films of bollywood this year till now .
3,"Genuinely speaking before watching it i was considering it as an average movie, although i was waiting for it since very long.
But frankly speaking this is an amazing and must watch movie
Very gripping with many twists and turns"
4,"If you are really sick n tired of this pandemic situation, then watch this movie it will work as a medicine. Fantastic work by Raj Kumar rao (The Mithun Style), Pankaj Tirpathi (The kaleen bhaiya) and ofcourse ANURAG BASU.
People who are saying this movie is ruining our hindu mythology n all kind of stuffs, go watch Ramayana.
When people talk about humor, chemistry, story, I want to ask you Do you really understand all of these words?
Passing comments is very easy, but Hats off for making a movie specially working in this situation where no one moving out of their house until it's an emergency.
So guys stop writing illogical things, do write what do you feel genuinely."
5,"Really great storyline , only talentless people or say boycott gang will give bad review without watching ! Give it a try and support talent really appreciate the effort of the film !"
6,"Fabulous movie!!

Abhishek Bachchan 's best movie"
7,A well written lengthy story. Never boring. Not to be missed
8,What a movie...Best writing... screen play... dialogues..movie teaches us beautiful lesson of life... Rajkumar rao...Pankaj sir..J.A.B..& all the casts done their job brilliantly...
9,Excellent narration by Anurag Basu. Very good performances from Rajkumar and Pankaj. Best watch of 2020
10,"Loved the black comedy which is so rare in Bollywood. Great cast, good acting overall and the story was so fresh and fun and made for 100% entertainment. May not be for the masses but i Loved it, highly recommend."
11,"What a masterpiece!! Seamlessly the story keeps on shifts one to another. What you have is a roller coaster ride thrilling yet smooth. Anurag Basu's story telling ability has been a class apart same like Barfi,Jagga Jasoos buy what's entertaining here is the story which builds up the traction as you get into every character
Cinematography is awesome as usual .and Pritam's music .still chanting hardam harpal."
12,"A must watch movie, Basu has nailed it completely, the message is sometimes happiness outscores practicality, also sin is overrated and mostly misunderstood and it has been delivered very well if u read between lines."
13,"Firstly, don't expect too much after watching the trailer. Now talking about the movie, the writing of Ludo is very good, but screenplay is little confusing. Yet there will be no problem as Anurag himself is there to explain you. Some moments are really very nice, specially when 2 stories are colliding.Cinematography is brilliant. The character of Rajkumar Rao shines the most. Abhishek Bachchan, Fatima Sana Shaikh & Little Inayat Verma also gave very good performance. The song 'O Beta Ji' will remain with you. Finally, Ludo succeeds to leave a smile on your face."
14,"Starting from the beginning till ending the movie didn't made a second to skip like. Not a single song, a scene felt like to be skipped. The best release of 2020 indeed! The storyline omg so twisted yet approachable n amazing‚ù§ The movie felt like got ended in 2 hr 21min bt thn again in 2hr 27min the plot turned upside down. Literally WowüíØ And lastly the concept of Yamraj felt so unique."
15,"What a great movie! Loved each and every second of it. Great cast! From Abhishek Bacchan to Aditya Roy Kapoor to Pankaj Tripathi, never let me feel bore.
This should be the movie with 9+ ratings instead of a recent movie which got 9+ ratings (iykwim). ;)"
16,Feels good to watch dark comedy in bollywood. Movies like Ludo and Lootcase should be made more rather than mediocre comedies like Housefull where it feels like the movie is made for audience with 0 IQ. The theme of Ludo definitely feels inspired from Guy Ritchie movie style. Matches theme of Snitch and The Gentlemen.
17,Great sense of humour. Good screenplay and beat acting. Some very big things are the timing of the dialogues are good and interesting especially Pankaj tripathi as always. Good direction skill shown by the director however there are rooms for editing as movie is long around 2 and half hours. Climax is good. Imagination of a nice idea.
18,Ludo is a chaotic yet fun to watch film. Expect the unexpected in this dark comedy anthology as you do in the case of life or a game of ludo. The characters like players of ludo criss cross and get second chances. Anurag Basu draws parallel with the unpredictable game of ludo and stitches four different stories together to come up with this delightful piece of filmmaking which is a unique experience in cinematic viewing.Various characters get ample opportunity to shine and the actors playing them never miss the mark. Pankaj Tripathi yet again steals the show playing the role of a gangster. This bundle of talent creates an entertaining character with the help of his gestures and expressions. Rajkumar Rao plays the role of a lover who is willing to go to any extent for the sake of his love. He is extremely endearing and stands out with his antics. Abhishek Bachchan gets into his always likeable angry mode and plays the role of a tough guy who has a soft heart with a lot of brooding intensity. He is outstanding in the scene where he meets his daughter after a long time. Aditya Roy Kapoor is a real surprise as he does well in a very interesting character. His voice modulations and mimicry (Assuming they are done by himself) are effortlessly amazing. The leading ladies Sanya Malhotra and Fatima Sana Shaikh also play interesting roles. Whether its Sanya playing a confused character or Fatima a manipulative one they have both done a great job.Pritam creates another melodious soundtrack for Anurag where the songs are seemlessly placed with the narrative. O betaji an old evergreen song has been used humorously in the story. The four colours of ludo game have been used intelligently. The film talks about karma as well as philosophy of life but all in a lighter vein. It brings a smile on your face as Anurag had rightly mentioned in his interviews. Its a mad world created by him and his team where you sit back and enjoy this crazyball comedy like a game of ludo. This light breezy entertainer is perhaps the best Diwali watch this weekend.
19,"After many ordinary movies like Cargo,Serious Man (Below 2.5 stars) finally Netflix got a original project this right. The script was perfectly planted because it is never easy to maneuver 4 stories with atleast 2 leads per story at thesame time with so much interest. The script is perfectly crafted. You will never realise this movie is 2:22 hrs long."
20,Anurag Basu knows how to play with the audience. This is yet another example of creative film making by the Barfi director. The way characters were introduced & the way climax was presented was outstanding. A must watch film.
21,"Great film amazing starcast
Good acting
Fantastic story
One of the best film of 2020"
22,"Credit Goes to Mr.Anurag Basu with a good story and direction. How Brilliantly narrated, and each of the characters suites as per the story. There is some flaws but its worth to watch."
23,"Unusual dark comedy where many unwanted things, desires and disasters are fragmented through some truly talented actors of Bollywood. Four characters are struggling in four different story yet connected in some aspects. Sometimes it feels like confusing but brilliant transaction among each story makes this movie so enjoyable.Worth watching"
24,Each and every character of the movie are well connected and the story is climax full at each point of movie time.
25,"This is very good moive all characters are osm and full pack romance, thrill , action and drama. üëåüëå"
26,Indeed a good movie which you won't regret watching it. Totally different stories which are inter-related to each others..lot of funny scenes.
27,"I was pretty excited to see Ludo. I loved the cast and Anurag Basu is a director that puts up interesting and experimental films like Barfi! and Jagga Jasoos that other Hindi film directors don't do.Ludo, like the board game, shows four different storylines and how they all connect by fate.To be perfectly honest, I feel quite mixed on it. There are certain aspects that I appreciate and other choices that frankly annoyed me. It's very rare to see a director do the cinematography for their own film. The only other time I've seen that happen is with Roma directed by Alfonso Cuar√≥n and I liked what Basu did with it. The use of the four colours in the board game: red, blue, yellow and green are present in the film in many places whether it's to do with costumes, vehicles, lighting or buildings. It made the film look really good and suits the film's title really well. For a black comedy, the dialogues are decent. Rajkummar Rao and Pankaj Tripathi get the best ones and there are quite a few laughs from them.The entire cast do a great job. It's great to see Abhishek Bachchan in a film after a long time. I always considered him to be underrated and he does a great job. He gives a restrained performance and so a lot of emotions come from his eyes which conveys the pain he goes through really well. Pankaj Tripathi is very fun to watch and is great as usual. Aditya Roy Kapur and Sanya Malhotra are great together. Rohit Saraf and Pearle Manney are pretty good as well. Fatima Sana Shaikh and Rajkummar Rao are excellent. I liked the relationship they had with another and is one of the highlights of the film.There were a couple of narrative choices which bugged me during my viewing. Anurag Basu is in the film and serves as the narrator who discusses the film's themes and character traits. It's this choice that really brought down the film for me. I wish he would've let us figure out what the overall meaning and purpose of the film is rather than holding our hand and blatantly telling us. The background score also tells us how to feel during a scene. If something funny is happening, comedic music starts to play which shouldn't be the case as the comedy should speak for itself. The film is also pretty long and I feel it could have been cut down. I don't think the abundance of songs added much and the pacing during the second act could have tighter. There are a couple of special effects used which aren't polished at all.Ludo is a yet another interesting film by Anurag Basu but it has problems that really brought down the film for me. A lot of people seem to like Ludo and you can see it on Netflix if you want. I would recommend seeing Amores Perros and Super Deluxe if you haven't already. I think these films do a better job at this genre."
28,"Amazing loved it. Every character, every story plot is amazing. What a black comedy laughter express."
29,"Kudos to Mr basu and entire team. Amazing flat form,good acting, Fatima sana sheikh acting is exposed,all are good..Good story, Amazing music by pritam dada..."
30,Brilliant movie excellent story acting screenplay direction Or departments Did good job Blue after long time good story in bollywood
31,"Wonderful movie, another level direction and screenplay, strongly recommend..
Overall one of a kind movie.. Fabulous"
32,"Thanks a lot anurag basu for making such wonderful film. I was sick and tired of watching over aged above 50 actor.
Really loved the way story is narrated how all characters have impact on eachother life.
You will feel glimpse of burfi which was also amazing movie.
Its a paisa vasool movie"
33,It's a paisa Wasool . You will end up with smile . You wouldn't regret watching this movie .
34,It is very entertaining. Must watch. The characters are well elaborated. The story has it's own way of unfolding sequences. And like always Pankaj Tripathi played his part fantastically. And the kid was cherry on the top.
35,"Great acting, story and brilliant direction and screenplay."
36,"Amaging story and flow!!! Avishek and others,everyone played their role way too perfect. The dirctor, writer and others associated deserve a thumbs up"
37,"Excellent screenplay, superb acting by Rajkumar Rao and Pankaj Tripathi, every single character was important. Overall should watch movie"
38,Got to see a fun film after a lomg time....pankaj tripathy steals the show....nd rajkumar rao too good....watch it for these two guys.....rest everyone has been good....
39,The amount of energy put in by the actors and the story primarily is unmatched.
40,Too much fun excellent of humour and outstanding performance & last but not least good direction and editing a complete movie.
41,"Well edited, great screen play. Everyone lived in their role. 150 minutes just fly by."
42,"What an epic movie, a must watch.. very entertaining..."
43,"If you hadn't watched any great movie in a while then you should go for this one.
Anurag Basu always do some kind of magic in the cinematography of his films and this one is exceptionally great movie."
44,"Movies are a medium in which a good director can convey a lot without words, and there are some fine moments like that in Ludo. There are also deft storytelling touches, like the two characters that the movie opens with - they have intriguing metaphysical discussions about the actions of the other characters, and it's only at the climax that we are told who these two are. They're not important to the movie, but having them makes it more interesting and enjoyable.There are complex intersecting story lines. The screenplay, editing and camera work are generally excellent. The performances by all the actors , even the relatively less known ones, are uniformly good. All these plus the unexpected artistic extras make this a very rewarding watch.The movie does have some downsides. When the climax rolls around it's a big relief, because the plot feels overly stretched out by then. The length should have been cut by at least 20min. The continuous intersection of story lines feels forced after a point. There is a subplot involving Abhishek Bacchan and a little girl, and in spite of the charming performance by the girl, that story line is weak and predictable, and omitting it would have improved the movie. Some plot devices are overused, you'll know what I'm talking about when you watch it.As a comedy this movie deserves a 9. But overall I'd rate it as an 8."
45,"Thank You Anurag Basu for LUDO <3There is nothing ANTY-HINDUISM in this movie. This movie has a deep message and not for everyone :)'LIFE IS LUDO & LUDO IS LIFE' - This line is completely matched with the storyline of the movie. Acting, Screenplay, Direction - everything is just brilliant. Such A Masterpiece <3"
46,"Ludo is a comedy thriller told in multi linear narration. It revolves around characters like sattu bhai a gangster, his former aide bittu, stand up comedian akash and his girlfriend shruthi, a theatre artist and hotel owner alok and his ex lover pinki, nurse sheeja and salesboy rahul. How these characters are related and connect together is the rest of the film.
I started watching the film for rajkumar rao and pankaj tripathi but it was abhishek bachchan for whom I rooted for. I got hooked with his track after his character bittu meets mini(inayat varma). Their chemistry was heartwarming and a delight to watch. His scene where he meets daughter makes you emotional. Ludo is a perfect comeback for junior bachchan. Rajkumar rao was impressive and I loved his long hair. Pankaj tripathi was brilliant as usual.
The climax was not satisfying for me because I couldn't digest sattu bhai who ruined bittu's life in the end enjoying a happy family life and bittu getting a sad death. Also I didn't like pinky killing off her husband as she could get rid of him in other ways too.
On the whole, ludo is a very entertaining film which makes you laugh and cry at the same time. Despite being a multi linear narration, one never gets confused. One of the best ott films released during these bad times."
47,Awesome acting of Pankaj Tripathi as usual.Mind blowing story line
48,"Movie is justt wooow enjoyed till end one of the best movie of 2020 @TripathiiPankaj nailed Comedy and expressions were
Comedy, emotional, worked well
@juniorbachchan role was so emotional
@RajkummarRao"
49,"#MovieReview #SpoilerFree #Ludo #Netflix #BollywoodAnurag Basu's Ludo is a delightful laugh riot featuring a motley crew of quirky characters that keep you hooked for 2.5 hours.A portmanteau tale of interconnected storylines Ludo has it all-from a resurfaced sex tape to a child who kidnaps herself for attention!Abhishek Bachchan delights as refined gangster 'Bittu' alongside an adorable Inayat Khan as 'Mini'. Sanya Malhotra and Rajkumar Rao also excel in their roles.However, it is Pankaj Tripathi again who steals the show with his over-the-top performance as the beleaguered don 'Sattu' Bhai keeps you ROFLMAOing throughout.His three-stooges like act is as unpredictable as it is funny. Two thumbs up for this whimsical, albeit nonsensical tale.Recommended!"
50,Its very good movie.. Everybody should watch the film..
51,"It's a good entertaining movie. A bunch of good actors, a good script, and Pankaj Tripathi. What more you want in this pandemic!! Go watch it."
52,"Totally worth it. there r some people who says this movie is hinduphobic.for them"" Are bhosdiwalo bc jindigi yahi karte karte gujar jayegi tumhari"". There is line in movie where narrator says nothing is wrong nothing is right. It's all about perspective. so true tho."
53,Entertainment full on i feel Anurag Basu is a under-rated film maker director is in his best loved the performance specially dangal girls i want a new world üôàüôàüôàüôàüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòâ
54,Complete waste of time. It's the same experience I had for Kaal. Total loss.
55,"What a waste of time. Total boring story screenplay. Is it black comedy ?????????
I didn't laugh for a second. I was thinking when the movie should end .the movie was going haywire from one and to another so much of confusion so much of boredom. What's the purpose of good acting if your story is such bad I would never recommend a film like this to anyone........"
56,"When you see the star cast of Ludo along with the director's name, the expectations really go high. Movie is filled with talented people but unfortunately the captain of the ship has no control over its proceedings. The movie is a lacklustre from the word go. While you wait for things to pick up, unfortunately it never does and you are left wondering what exactly is going on. For a movie with different storyline's, the most important aspect is to keep the viewers engaged and interested. This is where Anurag fails. You just are never interested in any of the stories shown and are left wondering why did they even make such a movie. Despite all the flaws, only Rajkumar shines.Easily avoidable."
57,"People giving 1 stars are the ones who couldn't understand the movie or who are impatient. Nice concept, great acting , A well versed Dark Comedy Movie in Bollywood after long time! So watch it!"
58,I didn't like the movie as it was filled with complete nonsense
59,"I have watched lot better South movies in Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam which are far better executed and edited than this Ludo Movie. I clearly had a feeling of already watched scenes and stories of this sort in the past 15 years in South Industry. Finally, Ludo is a combination 4 or More South Industry Movies by a Director."
60,"I usually don't watch new Indian movies or TV shows but decided to watch Ludo for some reason. It was two and a half hours of cringefest, felt like watching nickelodeon, I swear I'll never watch sillywood movies again. Can't believe it's a netflix original. #Netflix #Ludo"
61,"Very unrealistic portrayal of the characters. The situational portrayal does not match at all with the image of the characters played.
The mix and match and unwarranted roller coaster makes it too lengthy and dragging."
62,"Worse movie everüò°.
Lack of proper picturization...not a good movieüëé"
63,"Director has lost his brain in rabbit hole. Nothing to keep the audience continue watching and complete nonsense.
Good star cast wasted by ridiculous work of director and writer."
64,"It's one of the best 2020 Indian Netflix movie.
You should watch it. I know you guys want to boycott Bollywood but you should give a chance to this movie and watch it at least one time."
65,"If u want to waste money n time , plzz watch this movie üòú"
66,Much needed break from stereotype up-bihar movies that is now everywhere from web series to movie. Anurag basu has class of its own.
67,A Nice Movie Which Has Everything In It. If Creators Cut Duration By 30 Minutes Then It's Became More Enjoyable.
68,"Entertaining story Line.
Fabulous acting by the cast specially Pankaj Tripathi and Rajkumar Rao."
69,"Isbar deeksha didi sahi h!.. 100% masterpieceü§£ü§£
Pankaj sir rocked it"
70,This movie is nothing less then a masterpiece .. There must be more such movies made.. Kudos to the writers actors special mention Rajkumar Rao.. Tripathi ji.. AB for a change..Aditya roy .. All the characters were fun .. Such a treat to eyes
71,"This movie is certainly not for everyone, but people who likes Dark , Satirical, and Confusing Stories then it's really good for you!!! and for Anurag Basu's attempt I'll give him 10 out of 10."
72,Love it great twist to the story line need few more of these movies!!! Interesting the way this story line connected.
73,"Ludo is one of a kind, undoubtedly one the bests in Bollywood. From the character enhancement to the marvelous visual depiction, everything makes you love the surreality of the film. And last but not the least, the classy cinematography keeps it chaotically intact."
74,According to me..one of the best movie of 2020... Its worth watching... I enjoyed every second of it... Epic performance epic story... Everyone should watch it... And enjoy this masterpiece..
75,"Best comedy movie after andhadhun in bollywood,i didnt expected ,but it came out to be surprise,the story pace is very fast"
76,What a wonderful movie it is!!A must watch movie available on Netflix...
77,"What a movie by Anurag Basu! It's worth watching. Some great acting from each character. There are all necessary eliments in the movie such as powerful screenplay, Gripping Story, unexpected story telling and great acting from Pankaj Tripathi, Rajkumar Rao, Abhishek, Sanya Malhotra, Aditya Roy Kapur and others. Don't miss the movie, it's great watch."
78,"This movie is the best film in 2020.Everyone in this film has acted well, specially inayat verma has done amazing work. Classic Anurag basu film."
79,"Ludo
The story of different person linked with each other in a story"
80,"This movie deserves all the accolades, coz it is class apart."
81,"Great movie, eye catching performances by Rajkumar Rao, Pankaj Tripathy & last but not the least Abhishek Bacchan. Other characters are good as well as."
82,Thanks for providing a really comedy. Its song also lovely‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
83,"Its a roller coaster of a movie, class act well inter twined of a spectacle. anurag basu is india's tarantino & even more. should goto win all awards, what a vision what a execution what a movie. a movie that inspires the watcher, a non actor / a lay person that i wish i was part of the movie somehow, has struck all the chords & is a game winner."
84,"After Barfi, another Masterpiece comes from Anurag Basu !! In this ""Dark Comedy of Errors"", 4 different stories intertwine in an intricate manner to create utterly hilarious & violent situations. The star of this film is Anurag himself, writing such a complicated screenplay, then directing with such mastery and also picturising it with such beauty. Then comes Pankaj Tripathi, Rajkumar Rao in ridiculously quirky avatars and Abhishek Bachhan with a heartwrenching performance. The music also stands out. Although the film sometimes overindulges and the narrator thing didnt really add anything to the film.
If you are depressed due to Covid or from watching Laxmi, Do give this one a Try, you will have a fabulous time."
85,"I was not expecting that this black comedy will be this good. Blended mixture of emotions and laughter.
The chemistry between each character is superb. The scenes were so perfectly connected. One of the best crime laughter black drama comedy movie. The background music too is superb."
86,"In this age of movies releasing on OTT platforms, very few have managed to intrigue me in the recent past as much as the latest Netflix original, Ludo.
Ludo starts off with a catchy opening track (yesteryear legend Bhagwan Dada's famous song), an appealing start and a quirky narrative. The criss-crossing between characters (which is the highlight of this anthology) is observed by a pair of commentators, including the director, Anurag Basu (his second anthology after the 2007 film, Life in a Metro). However, as the multiple characters get introduced one by one with each storyline randomly running back and forth aimlessly, you begin to wonder what is actually going on? This is one of the biggest drawbacks of the movie.
The ensemble cast deliver some credible performances - Pankaj Tripathi at his usual ""gangster-best"" apart, Abhishek Bachchan, Shalini Vatsa (as Nurse Lata Kutty) and Pearle Maaney (as Nurse Shreeja) really stand out. Rajkummar Rao's Mithun fan avatar is fun while Fatima Sana Shaikh as the sometimes docile, sometimes trigger-happy woman-scorned is a revelation.
In the end (and quite often in the middle too), the movie tries to get too preachy - saying everyone's version of ""good"" and ""bad"" is subjective by ruminating on the concept of ""sin and virtue"", the importance of second chances and the unpredictable nature of life itself!
But somehow, the individual tiles do not lead to that all-elusive ""home"" and sadly that's where this game of Ludo is lost!"
87,"If you get it you will like it, if not it wouldn't make sense. These type of movies requires a different sensibility, which Indian audience generally lack. If you like Pulp Fiction , this movie will be gold for you."
88,"Really appreciate the work done by Anurag Sir and Pankaj Tripathi Sir.Loved Narration and Screenplay the most, expecting more in future üéâüëèüëèüëèüëèüéâ"
89,All the characters are awesome.. one of the best comedy movies ever made ... pankaj tripathi did his work very well as always.. all the actors palyed their role fantastically.. a must watch movie..
90,A long due good movie from Bollywood. Just Brilliant.
91,Raj Kumar Rao outshine everyone .... Pankaj Tripathi and Abhishek Bacchan did well but RKR gonna impress you the most .....
92,There were a lot of illogical things in this movie but I enjoy the laughter I got while watching it. Amazing story with lors of twists and turns. Have a shot! Thank you
93,"Story telling,screen play to direction is very good. Each character connects in perfect way . Characters portrayed suits them and acted brilliantly üëåüëå Movie gets messier as it continues and entertains us üòç"
94,"Don't judge it by reviews.
It's a masterpiece.
Music of the movie is so good.
You will love the cinematography and everyone's performance.
The entanglement of everyone's story will amaze you.
Don't miss it."
95,"A true masterpiece just like andhadhund the direction of anurag basu is absolutely out of this world the film has comedy ,drama , action ,romance and that masala that every bollywood movie needs."
96,What a well written and played movie. The second half off the movie was just hilarious. Pankaj Trpathi beating all the odds here !!
97,"Pretty decent movie. The only gripe is at the length, I guess Anurag got lazy with the editing, knowing it was going straight to OTT. Abhishek track was the weakest, same brooding expression as in Yuva, Raavan. Need to show some variety. Pankaj is getting boring with the same sauve gangster look. Rao was phenomenal. Girls & Rohit did well. Gangster meets Life in a Metro in Jagga Jassos canvas."
98,"Fantastic editing, directing and great intermingling of the stories. Would've gotten a 10 on 10 like Talwar did from me had they logically concluded the films best characters story--the girl and the man , both were incomplete."
99,"Genuinely funny and poignant, you will root for the characters and fall in love with them, even the apparently villainous ones! Beautifully crisscrossing storylines and comedy of errors, thoroughly enjoyed it. After Jaane bhi do yaaron, Andaz apna apna, Hera pheri ... here is another classic in the making. Definitely must watch!"
100,"For me it was 8.5 stars. I could have gave full stars but there were slow screenplay after 2nd half and some nonsense logic less scenes. Otherwise, everything was good."
101,Really enjoyed it. Well made. Another Anurag Basu special.
102,"Movie is very funny and the direction is top class.
Finally Indian cinema is changing.
So glad it s finally happening"
103,Best movie..it contains such a awesome story and acting also best... Abhishek Bachchan done well... rajkumar rao make space in your heart with his acting...
104,"Really loved the beautifully woven film. Rao Kumar Rao, Siddharth Roy Kapoor, Pankaj Tripathi, Fatima S Shaikh, Sanya Malhotra all performed really well. But Abhishek Bachchan yet again prove that he is a actually a great actor. That story is very close to my heart. Watch the movie this weekend! The scene where Abhishek is trying to look at his daughter is the best."
105,Every charector done his job above the level. Pankaj Tripathi and rajkumar rao are outstanding.
106,Best thing in 2020. This is the real talent of indian actors. You should definitely ignore the Boycott gang and 1 star gang. Must watch movie üçø
107,Every person in ths cast made their work precisely good.
108,"#LudoIf you ask me whether it's good or not.It is CRAZY! Madly it is crazy man! when I'm watching even a half second i didn't move my eyes.Screenplay is so good.Raj kumar rao and Pankaj Tripathi's roles are only made for themDon't Skip it! Watch, streaming on Netflix"
109,"Marvelous acting by rajkumar, love the part of abhishek bachann and cute girl, pankaj tripathi was amazing as usual..."
110,Hates off the director Anurag sir. Best screenplay in bollywood. Amezing Creativity.
111,"One of the best movies of 2020.
Funny movie with strong acting"
112,It's a marvellous one .... a film which refresh us and our mind
113,"Worthy to watch,full of content & intimidated chemistry of Aditya & Sanya. Fatima's character is also noticeable."
114,"I can honestly say, best movie I have seen this year. Comedy is genuinely funny. Great humor. Everyone's did their part best. Loved Rajkumar's character the most."
115,"This film is in turn brilliant, bewildering and totally nuts. A sensory explosion of colour, humour, philosophical sensitivity, passion and aggression. A veritable delight, refreshingly original and with so much to sink your teeth into and ponder upon. Thank you, Anurag Basu and to a cast and team that must have put a huge amount of effort and energy into this gem of a film."
116,LUDO is hands down the BEST film to have come out of the Hindi film industry in a very long time ... not only 2020 but lets say in the last couple of years . It's a rollercoaster ride with more thrills than expected
117,"Very well impressive movie , Very special entertained movie , only songs are boorings ."
118,Just An Brilliant Movie .... Such a Great Story Also Pankaj Tripathi Killing Perfomance ..
119,This is the worst movie for 2020. The movie tries to join 4 stories together but does a miserable job
120,Excellent acting(s) from some veterans along with some novice actor's brilliant performances.
121,"Never seen such pathetic film,
And never imagines that
Such worst movie should be allowed to release"
122,Very boring movie made by Anurag my expectations is very high from him.
123,Worst movie. The actors have not performed well.direction was big let down
124,Storyline not good. Acting has to be worked on more. Copied plot.
125,Third rate story and acting. Better skip it. I would rather call it a dark tragedy for viewers.
126,Start of the movie is really marvelous. Panjkaj tripathi has again proven himself
127,Highly entertaining movie! I enjoyed every bit of it. Good combination of crime and dark humour. Didn't feel boring at all. Anurag Basu's direction is amazing and all the actors did a great job here. Good music as well. Reminded me of Pulp Fiction.
128,Movie is is a good eg. Hinduphobic otherwise it is a good entertainer
129,Don't feel writing more about it or even wasting my time to write how pathetic movie this could be
130,Disrespecting Ram Leela.Why cannot you people make something without insulting Hindus
131,"As a typical urduwood product,it is filled with Hindu phobia"
132,"Is Hinduphobic and has sudden scenes with no reference really where there is Hindu Bashing!! A complete miss!!
About time people come up with rich content and don't need Hinduphobia for the sake of it.."
133,Over the years there have been many Tarantino wannabees. The plot is fine but the dialogues are not as engaging . RajKumar's acting chops carry the movie on its shoulders. Could have been better with a more stylish screenplay. At times the movie could not be related to. The music is a disaster. But better than the usual bollywood crap obviously. Honestly you can skip it altogether. But you may enjoy. No one has the same taste right?
134,Anurag Basu can do better. Rajkumar Rao and Saniya were good! Overall thumbs down
135,I thought that this series is good for diwali watch.but it turnouts nightmare for me.its have real shiiit!! .
136,Don't waste your time On this senseless movie! Terrible acting by Abhishek Bachchan! I don't understand why he just doesn't give up acting. He is offered role sjust because of his father. High time people start finding real talent instead of these good for nothing star kids.
137,There is no story in this movie. They don't have story as well as they tried to do propaganda. It is very difficult to finish this movie. Shame on director and shame on Netflix for wasting my precious time. Please watch this movie if you want to waste your time and then regret why you wasted your precious time of life.
138,A boring and a tiring movie. Regret for wasting my precious time
139,"Very boring movie with no logical sense. It's multiple love stories into one movie, don't understand what is dark humor in the movie. Watch at your risk!!!!"
140,"A big waste of time.. senseless dialogues
ugly in all ways.. the worst comedy film ever released.. a big waste."
141,"Wanna be content, no story line whatsoever. Just good flashy visuals"
142,"Mocking Hinduism is black comedy? have no Bala to to do same with others, and last worst screen play"
143,"Why Hinduism is insulted in every Bollywood movie
I hate this movie"
144,"Long, boring, predictible,
If you wanna watch Hindu Gods being insulted left right and center.. Then watch.. faltu..."
145,"This movie is such a torture.. Bollywood PR active and giving good ratings for their cheap movies ..
WORST MOVIE"
146,"Hateful content, casual bigotry towards hindu festivals completely unnecessary in the plot line yet feature with the sole purpose of spreading hate"
147,"Total disregard to sentiments of hindus. Abusing gods, showing gods beyond creative freedom acceptable levels and deliberate insults. Shame."
148,Movie starts by insulting Hindu sentiments. Yet another movie from award waapsi gang who try divide India on basis of religion.
149,The drug addicted bollywood actors & flim makers must be boycotted.
150,"If you enjoy making fun of hindu festival and Gods , then go ahead and watch."
151,"Editor has done worst job.
Cinematography is good."
152,"Its Very Bad movie
If there was Minus rating i would have given that.
All the High Ratings are either dumb or are paid.
The movie starts with a Vulgarity which is intended to be a joke which is pathetic.
Vulgarity and No Story with flop actors you get a failed Ludo game."
153,"Couldn't stand watch for more than 15 mins.. Super bore!
Don't waste your time and money on this."
154,Movie could have been better. they always make fun of hindu religion. another nepotism product of bollywood. sometime movie is very slow...
155,"Only one thing.....
Don't waste ur money on Bollywood.....U may thing in some movies they r taking self made actors....bt the real thing is that they r taking them so that the mafias can earn something in the name of these actors.......So don't waste UR money....."
156,"When it comes to acting Pankaj, Rajkumar are brilliant.Overall its an entertaining movie."
157,Highly disappointed. I would not recommend this to anyone and waste their valuable time.
158,Too boring !! Need more improvement when you have 1.3 billion population.Thanks.
159,This film is so insensitive to the beliefs of millions of Hindus across the globe. It mocks and riddicules Hindu beliefs and rituals. It is poorly made. In bad taste and there is no value in watching it.
160,"Pathetic movie with worst screenplay.
Wastage of time and data."
161,Not so interesting. dont want to waste money on this bollywood
162,Very bad pathetic movie......feel sad for RajKummar Rao. Abundance of talent can't choose a good script.....don't watch. U will be very disappointed.
163,"Time waste movie a poor tracks and unconvincing moments, the desired impact is not made. A marginal one time watch."
164,Very confusing. No central theme. It's a mash up of 4 stories which have no connection with each other and the stories randomly keep popping up without you actually coming to know what exactly is happening. Avoid this one and rather play ludo online. It will save your time and brain as well.
165,"Nice movie which capable of keeping a person at one place for more than two hours .You don't want to miss any minute of movie because lot of things are happening in it.Best part is story and screenplay.It feels like 4 Stories are moving around one epicentre.Every story will give you defination of love in its own way. Pankaj Tripathi , Aditya Roy Kapoor, Sanya malhotra, Rajkumar rao are rocking on screen . I felt Abhishek bachhan , Fatima and one new couple are little weak in their performance.Abhishek has nice role and scenes still he unable to prove himself.The direction and most imp editing in such films is difficult but they nailed it.Its really fun watching movie .Do watch."
166,Deliberately insulting hindu gods and godessesdisgusting movie insulting indians and hindu religionmaking fun of indias top national reporter arnab goswamibollywood is full of corrupt drug addictsall funded by mafia in dubaivery bad movie
167,"Another hinduphobic movie , with the aim to disrespect Hindu gods in their stupid plays and story line. just like Laxmi bomb how they show Love Jihaad is good and shud be accepted"
168,"Ludo Is the multi starrer anurag basu directed Netflix original film.
If you are not a fan of musicals this film is not for you, however if u love multiple storylines coming together in the end then LUDO is for you.
The film has a very fast paced editing and you have to pay attention every single second in order to keep up with the storyline, also there are certain scenes that appear to be over edited where multiple storylines progress in the same frame.
The main quality of the fim that stand out is its writing. Also the starcast delivers an impeccable performance actingwise .
So overall if u are in for a fun rollercoaster this diwali, then LUDO is for you !!!"
169,Worst of Bollywood. Why waste so many resources on such a bad movie
170,A hinduphobic series working against the native indigenous people of colour
171,"Bakvas,waste of money ,making fun of hindu god,third rate gutter comedy i recommend dont watch this movie."
172,"Ludo review :Two strangers play a game of ludo even as one of them explains the meaning of 'paap' and 'punya' through six unrelated stories which merge together in the climax. Let me attempt to narrate the same through its characters :Pankaj Tripathi plays a bhai who kills a builder and is happy to find some other person jailed for his crime.Fatima Sana Shaikh's husband is that guy framed for the builder's murder and so she approaches her college friend Rajkummar Rao for help. Rajkummar, a Mithunda fan, still loves Fatima and can do anything for her...Abhishek Bachchan is a goon who has an axe to grind with Pankaj Tripathi who got him jailed for six years. He returns home to find his wife married to another guy and his little daughter living in a hostel. Bachchan attempts to reconcile with his daughter at any cost.A little school going girl elopes to seek attention from her ever busy parents. Coincidentally, she meets Abhishek and strikes a deal with him to feign her kidnapping.After their one night stand goes viral on internet, Aditya Roy Kapur and Sanya Malhotra keep searching for the seedy hotel which filmed their sex act.Rohit and Pearle accidentally stumble upon Pankaj's black money and run away with it. His goons are now on their trail..Anurag Basu's ambitiously mounted Ludo is one of the most muddled and confusing screenplays I have witnessed this year. The stories - per se - are actually simplistic and somewhat bland but the presentation is one hellavu convulted mess.Despite the solid ensemble cast, not one performance is worth a praise. Pankaj Tripathi is getting repetitive with his bhaigiri roles. Abhishek Bachchan gets no scope at all. Rajkummar Rao overacts as Mithun Chakraborty fan. Just to clarify, swinging hips wildly is not Mithunda and those who feel so should watch Mrigaya (1976), Agneepath (1990), Tahader Katha (1992) and Swami Vivekananda (1998) to understand his range of acting. Aditya Rao Kapur makes weird faces at the camera. The Dangal (2016) girls - Fatima and Sanya - are strictly okay. As for Pearle, she shouldve chosen a better Bollywood debut than this.Technically, Ludo scores well if we can discount that badly recreated Pankaj Tripathi den. Anurag Basu's cinematography is first rate. Pritam's music is another plus point.Finally, Ludo is yet another underwhelming film from Basu. Gangster (2006), Life in a Metro (2007) and Barfi (2012) are his best works till date. The director hasnt been able to match up to his own standard making highly indulgent cinema offlate.Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni."
173,Deserves to be released in big screens ! Such a masterpiece it is. With such enormous cast and direction this is the best of 2020. A great appreciation for Anurag Basu for creating such a brilliant story. Liked the Concept of Story portrayed in the form Ludo. Do Watch it ! Dare to miss such masterpiece.
174,The movie horrible. Bollywood again copies from South India for idea. Such a shame. Pls stop making such idiotic movies.
175,Performances are superficial... Direction lacks depth.... Dialogues are misplaced... Movie sounds more like activism with agenda at viewers expense...Not done...
176,"The movie starts well, and surprisingly Abhishek Bachchan played his role much better than Aditya Roya Kapoor who literally screwed up a good movie.I was expecting a stellar performance by Anurag Basu .. but it seems I was asking for too much."
177,Not even worth the time. I would rather sit n stare at the sky instead. But this movie lacks everything. Pathetic acting poor storyline.
178,Trash trash trash don't know what they think of themselves make any kooda movie and serve it to the audience tada..... Audience to c*****ya hai h n??
179,"Why should one watch mocking Hindu culture, these days it's trend to do it..."
180,What a rubbish movie. Has no sense. Tried to be funny in parts but just didn't create any impact. For almost an hour you don't know what's happening. Anurag Basu movies are really losing the intricate storytelling they used to have.
181,Amazing!!!!!!! Very Entertaining! Dont miss this Movie.
182,"One after the other, propaganda movies are failing. This movie, unlike Laxmii however, has very subtle propaganda. Like the scene where girl tells her mom, mandir hoon mummy. Or the one where the guy makes in a stand up comedy says desh ki media sarkaar ki godd mein hai. I mean, these people don't tire out with such gimmicks. Anyway not a very interesting storyline either"
183,"Movie insults my religion, movie is boring instead watch youtube videos, I watch ed on telegram no need to subscribe netflix"
184,"Same old jokes on Hindus and Hindu gods. Demeaning Ram, repeated from PK scenes.
Too boring, trailer is enough for the movie. Even if it's on OTT platform it's total waste of time."
185,The story is good but overall the movie is not as per the expectation.. needs to be improved.
186,"Ludo is a cute, care-free entertainer which has it's good side and bad side. All the performances were great but performances of Rajkumar Rao, Pankaj Tripathi and Fatima Sana Shaikh stand out. There are several moments in this film in which we'll say ""soooo cute"". Watch it and have fun."
187,"Overall it will entertain you. Since it's a bollywood movie, everybody got what he/she deserved eventually. Pretty much predictable and that's why you might feel why is it taking so long to come to the end climax. If you are good, good happens to you. That's the moral. I give it 7 star."
188,"Its not mandatory to give non star kid movies high ratings even if they are good.this movie has got high ratings just coz we're boycotting bollywood star kids and other mafias movies. but that doesn't mean we'll torture ourselves by watching such movies.well its less than ok movie. not pathetic, again good acting by pankaj tripathi , rajkumar rao. but them seems off. you can watch if you nothing to watch but this is not a good movie. script lacks story , don't know what's happening in movie all is like kichdi."
189,Waste movie. Don't spend money on this movie.Use this money to feed poor people to put smile on their face
190,"Dear Anurag Sir,
I have been big fan of you and these are true feelings of your past loyal fan. When I saw the trailer, i found so promising and it has met my expectations when I watched on the same release day. But what pushed you to have 3 incidents to mock Hindu relation? Why you also being part of the same group for whom art has been part of insulting specific Hindu religion, God and festivals? I could guarantee that whole movie and script would have been similar great without these insulting scenes. You broke my heart badly and all these actors who are part of these scenes and had no shame accepting it because they think it's part of story. Hate all of you guys and you really pushing me to get complete off from Bollywood .. a complete off üòî"
191,"Promoting anti-india agenda, making fun of Arnab Goswami."
192,"Bollywood have no story to grow the society & set the harmony in the society,,this movie is full of Hindufobic. I don't even understand why bollywood always mocks our religion Hindu."
193,Worst Movie I have ever seen. I don't seen option less than 1 to rate this movie.
194,"Story is full of loopholes . Director has tried very hard to bring out some laughs but fell flat. Many actors are completely wasted like Abhishek Bachhan, Pankaj Tripathi. Rajkumar Rao's role was a bit funny , rest intolerable. Why would Shruti come back to Akash was beyond my comprehension. Sheeja's story was a big waste . Overall a big letdown ,it's better to give a skip to this nonsensical movie."
195,"Such a good cast wasted. Waste of time.
Completely avoid."
196,"People giving 1/10 to this movie are seriously out of their mind. Still hung up on bad movies of Bollywood but as akshya sir said not everyone is bad, like that not every movie is bad atlest it's not 1/10 movie, plzz don't corrupt the minds of the watchers you don't want to watch Bollywood skip if you are watching judgement should unbaised guys. A must watch."
197,"This movies just shows that assembling the some good artists won't get you hit.
There is no content nor it serves any particular audiences,except some trigger happy public
It is a complete waste of character like rajkummar rao..but again majburi ka naam mahatma g.
May be I am disappointed so much because it comes from the stable of anurag basu.
This movie resembles somewhat greek mindless comedy. But this is ott platform ,here people are more button happy than directors trigger happy tingling....i could not watch for more than 20 minutes.....and pressed the back button.."
198,"It's a lethargic movie with no plot, everything is so Hayward , I couldn't bear till interval even,"
199,Tried watching Ludo. Gave up at last . Bollywood could get away with this kind of garbage content in the 90s when there weren't a lot of other options for the audience
200,"PLEASE DO NOT WASTE TIME .. i want my 2.29 min back nothing good in this movie , i wonder what Director smoked !!"
201,Here are the positives1. This movie is an eye opener to lion tailed macaques - now even they are inspired to make it in film and TV2. Bollywoo? Bollywho?3. Anurag Bas ab tu na na4. Throwing up**
202,"The movie is boring. I just wasted my time.
Don't watch it. Abhishek Bachchan is annoying."
203,"Why these idiot writers directors have to play with hindu gods, symbols. Please leave us alone."
204,Rather watch a plain white wall for 2 hours. Some bits are funny and by bits i mean 2 minutes of the movie.
205,"Played with hindu emotions. No story line.
Dumb movie"
206,Do not waste your time and money watching this movie.
207,"Sick and tired of propaganda movies, I'm cancelling my Netflix subscription."
208,"Ramlila in action & hero shouts on Ram - behenc**d. Then thrashes Ram.
Audience laughsRamlila is just a joke for Urduwood.1star just for hardwork of spot boys, cameramen etc . Otherwise it's just another ANTI-HINDU series.
These Morons dont have guys to mock other religions who will probably behead these dimwits.Follow Gemsofbollywood on Twitter to know how filthy they are."
209,"First put off- description itself is confusing. Apparently it's ""supposed to be"" something else but ended being something else.Actors are as awkward as they can get. None of the roles make storyline sense 20mins into it. Absolute trash. Best avoided"
210,"Review
Outstanding performance by Abhishek Bachchan and Rajkumar Rao
Direction is awesome
At the starting you might get confused but Anurag Basu(director)has narrated it and you will understand
Pearle M and Rohit S did a great performance
This movie is worth your time"
211,"This is an anthology, four short stories linked together. Pankaj Tripathi's screen presence is more engaging that anybody else's in the movie. While some stories are not that good, overall movie is definitely one time watch. Rajkumar Rao is good in his different avatar this time. Sanya Malhotra and Aditya Roy Kapoor have pulled up their respective roles pretty well. Pearley Maaney has done justice to her role, even though her dialogues are very less.Having said this, this is a MUST watch movie for Pankaj Tripathi's flawless performance :)"
212,"Movie dekhte dekhte neend aa gyi , i enjoyed sleeping"
213,If you are interested is wasting your time and brain cells then do watch this movie.
214,"When the movie story line tries to sell some irrelevant message, it ends up creating some nonsensical scenes which are not only digressing the plot but creates a sense of mockery for a great part of society. It's high time people start learning, respecting and bringing creativity in a much more subtle way rather than making fun of a community."
215,The movie is boring. New talents has been exploited. None of them look real. The characters look clumsy. Nothing special and unique. Simply boring.
216,Very loose plot... nothing new here.. forcibly tried put together stories... no humour...
217,"I genuinely do not understand what the hell was the reason to portray Hindu gods in such a comical sense to the point where they are pushing a vehicle and are ridiculed!
I mean would Muslims keep quiet if their Prophet is ridiculed or would the Christians be quiet if anybody ridicules their god?"
218,Done my part for deliberately mocking Hindu Gods and godess in their films
219,Disappointing Film.. Nothing in it to describe this Movie..
220,"No way to watch this movie and not to go into mind breaking depression
Nonsense and doesn't have any plot just stupid film to watch for maximum stupidity"
221,"Very overt slant against Hindus & their customs.
Cringe worthy content. Terrible overacting !!"
222,I think its paid PR who is rating it high. Its so pathetic. Some comedy elements were good but the movie did not have any logic and all the actors were so lame.. Did not even understand what they wanted to show the audience.. We had barfi which was good.. Then he made Jagga Jasoos that got bumped royally.. So tried a similar one with adult content.. Pathetic lame movie.. Not at all worth to spend 2.5hours
223,"Let me clear first anurag basu is like noncomercial director for me . but his silence comic timeings are best , thats reason you can watch his movie on any mood , if you go for logic maybe you could disappoint , but if you enjoy it definately you get a fun .in this movie he made faboulas job for binding 4 storys in one movie ."
224,"Very good film. Awesome story and connection. Abhishek, Pankaj, Rajkumar were super great. Female leads were also very supporting."
225,Spellbound narration with crisp transition. One doesn't feel lost amidst the other narrations - credit to director for weaving into a master piece.All the actors gave their best and specially AB deserves applauds for his terrific performance.
226,"Must watch movie, after a long time in pandemic , great to see a movie with good acting and plot without any overacting masala. Characters came alive due to the great performance by the actors. Starcast+action+acting+love=all in 1 movie, sorry to give 1 star less as you can't watch with parents
Thanks Anurag and team for giving such awesome movie"
227,"The title says it all . Super gripping till end .
We need to see more content like this in indian cinema what a refresher"
228,"A movie with good direction, great actors woth great acting skills. A full on entertainment. It's a must watch movie for sure."
229,Loved this movie.. loved the cast direction music and everything..a feel good movie with perfection
230,"If You Love Bollywood, You Are Welcome To Watch This Movie..."
231,"It's a good movie but not a masterpieceKuch kuch jaga story slow ho gai thi
Aur sala Aditya Kapoor aur sanya to bas story main gusa diya hai aisa lagta hai
Wo nhi hote to bhi koi farak nhi padta story mainPankaj and Rajkumar bhai rocks
Rohit and pearly did wonderful work"
232,Amazing movie.many years latter i saw good Bollywood movie
233,"The movie rocks. Great storyline, nice acting. Must watch!"
234,"The Thing I liked the most in this movie is Four Different Stories Overlapping at a Same Place in the Climax...
Love this Movie"
235,"It is awesome movie. I am watching third time now. Every time I find something I had missed before. All these people giving one star should just stick to Ramayana, Mahabharatha etc. Everything else is offending hinduism as per them. Reading these one star reviews I had to again go back and see what was offending"
236,"Nice to see such movies once in a while. The script is written beautifully as the various story lines continuously intertwine with each other without interfering with each character's own emotions and instincts. Unlike the many movies where seemingly indifferent character end up together to build a story, in this movie the 4 different story lines keep on progressing on their own which is wonderful to see.1 - Nov 14 2020"
237,It's just mind blowing movie. Pankaj Tripathi at his best.
238,It was a dissater movie. Waste of Time.Lodu movie.Confused direction and screen play
239,"Anurag Basu is a refined director and has unparallel way of direction & story telling like connecting stories with scenes and building new plot. Movie is a definitely freshly made and made well, Abhishek Bachchan shooting in paddy fields clearly shows they are ready to harvest. The movie just needed a little more time for enhancing the screenplay. Clearly there has to some difference between Guy Ritchie and Mr Basu.
Ludo is a mix of action romance with a blend of thriller. All the actors have strong characters and I believe every actor has done justice to it, RK Rao Mr Aditya Roy Pankaj Tripathi & Dangal girls - This is a bechmark of acting, keep doing well üëç.Overall a must watch and it could be biggest hit after the pandemic be it from OTT. Go for it üëçPS RK Rao No Woman No Cry song's jest no woman dont cry or should üò¢ üòä"
240,Anurag Basu has linked the stories in such an awesome way. Every actor has given his best here. Definitely recommend.
241,One of the best of Anurag basu. The real hero is the story
242,"Ludo is one of the best work to come on indian OTT after long time. The characters are interwind with eachother just like the game of ludo,It shows one goes out and comes back in the picture to a climax linked to all waiting for the first ""one on dice"" to take the game away,As we see there are winners and not many losers,the movie has some beautiful comic moments,a story which you can keep aside, emotions expressed by Rajkumar Rao are brilliant ,Abhishek has huge potential which was not done justice too. I would say go for it on any day and enjoy it. Anurag basu you did well :)"
243,"Combination of stories with great flow, best nip of romance, comedy and sentiments, pure class.must watch."
244,"Anurang Basu has made a better storyline movie among many disappointed film came from bollywood. The movie is a perfect treat to watch it on digital in this difficult time this movie will make you laugh,cry, emotion and fall in love with the Pankaj Tripathi, rajkumar rao and aaditya nailed their respective roles.
Sanya and Fatima has a better hold to their roles. Anurang's direction is very good."
245,"This move is not for everyone cup of tea, it has unique story telling style, cinematography, and story line. The will take you through a roller coaster ride and it will keep a smile on your face till the end. Everyone has acted amazing especially Pankaj Tripathi, oh what an actor he is. ""Life is Ludo and Ludo is Life""."
246,One of the best black comedy movies made in bollywood. Flawless acting by the cast. Script was exceptionally good and well executed by the director. Realllly enjoyed it. A must watch movie!!
247,"Each and every character has done well.... everyone is awesome. Specifically for the first time I felll in love with Aditya Roy Kapoor. I felt that he needs good director. For God sake Aditya choose good character and directors who can can make you act. You are handsome but you need good cultivator. As usual and as expected Raj Kumar Rao, Pankaj Tripathi remains the best...the best. Sanya malohtra, sana Shaikh, Abhishek Bachchan, Rohit suresh, Pearley Maaney,Shalini vatsa is also amazing...just liked it Mr. Basu - yamraj ji"
248,"Though it is always very difficult to run the story with so many star casts, but Anurag did it here.Acting is very good, screenplay is nice and script is nice. Long story but I didn't lose interest anywhere in full movie.I would say one of exceptional work of bollywood, but I just hope it's not remake of anything."
249,Good one... Anurag Basu again show his creativity... to show 4 plots and unite them in a nice way..
250,It's a great movie... But personally I think... It'll be better without slangs
251,Thrilling story with interesting twist makes it very engaging
252,"Ludo is easily in top 10 best film of 2020, the perfect cinematography, brilliant character arcs, script comparable to Ludo game, performances of the cast and music blending with it, Ludo has everything a perfect script would want, except at times it does become too chaotic but yet cannot remove it from my mind. Bow to you Anurag Basu, welcome back!Anurag Basu has been quite an underrated Bollywood director. With his films like Murder Barfi Gangster and Kites he's proven he has what a great storyteller needs. Even Jagga Jasoos could've been a brilliant film had delays and unnecessary script changes weren't there. Luckily Ludo gave him complete creative freedom and he excelled it well as pee required, without censorship and perfect OTT release, perhaps it would've failed in theatrical run but OTT made sure it's a success in best way possible.Cinematography of Anurag Basu and Rajesh Shukla Is the main USP of this film, how cinematography is used to define the colours of Ludo is commendable. The 4 colours representing 4 stories in which all the stories and how amongst them 3 reaches it's final spot while one of them remains behind is exactly how Ludo game is, kudos to Basu for the same. TBH all the stories deserved their own 2 hours long film, perhaps a series itself could've made this into a masterpiece. The track of Bittu-Mini(Red) remains my favourite, really wished the story itself had separate film for itself, it had lot more to explore and give us. Rahul-Sheeja(Blue) track was my second favourite, the innocent love story trapped within chaotic world, quite a relatable content. It could've been much darker and soulful had it received it's own film as well. Akash-Shruti(Yellow) track was a quirky one like a typical comedy and it too deserved its own film, perhaps a road trip comic caper would've made it fun watch. Alu-Pinky(Green) was unfortunately weakest link of the lot either deserved a better story or could've remained avoided one. And coming to Sattu Bhaiya(Dice), his own move and everything changed well, wished more of him in the film.Performances wise undoubtedly Pankaj Tripathi was the main man, in his typical gangster show but more of comedic one this time. Pankaj Tripathi is Bollywood's own God gift and fortunately he isn't lost in the competition but rather giving hard times to others. God forbid but we don't want Pankaj Tripathi to lose his position in Bollywood, or else it'll get destroyed instantly! But as Pankaj Tripathi soars high, it doesn't mean other cast members get overshadowed here. Closely next to him is ever dependable Rajkummar Rao, the best actor of today's generation! Give him whatever role you wanna give, he'll excel it with success. You may or may not like his film but he's always been giving his best shot, irrespective of how badly written script or his character is and even here despite of receiving a bad story arc compared to others, Raj lifts it very well given his naturally blessed acting skills. Coming to Abhishek Bachchan, now I've started to believe he's even better than his own father when it comes to acting. He's always been abused, cursed and mocked for his bad acting skills and to some extent I agree he was a weak actor and didn't get good script ever, but now Abhishek is getting better and better especially after Manmarziyaan and Breathe into the shadows, with more complex roles than his father ever did. His track remains the best of the lot here, especially when he unites with his onscreen daughter tears roll down your eyes and his death makes you cry even more. Hoping to see more of Abhishek Bachchan in the future. Aditya Roy Kapur remains in his usual self with not much improvement and kudos to Anurag Basu to utilise Aditya in his full potential. Although we've seen how ARK can perform well in Kalank and Malang, we've never got to see anything new from him besides his usual happy go lucky self, hope Bollywood utilises his potential well in the future. Rohit Suresh Saraf is the rising star here! At this age he's already excelling will in given Bollywood films he's worked in, hoping to see a solo lead role of Rohit as he deserves the success, cheers to the rising star. Ishtiyak Khan was great in his role too, hoping to see him soar high like Pankaj Tripathi instead of getting side roles only, fingers crossed!While the men have done great job, women aren't lagging behind at all. Inayat Verma was the best actress, perhaps best acting of the lot. Her sweetness and innocence wins over you instantly, especially her track is quite relatable in today's time. Her chemistry with Abhishek would make you want for her more. Sanya Malhotra is another star in making, her chemistry with ARK was another highlight, in which she overshadows Aditya despite being junior to him in experience. After Dangal Pataka and Photograph, another brilliant performance by Sanya and hoping to see more of her in future, perhaps in solo lead. Pearle Manney... she was really beautiful and acted very gracefully, her chemistry with Rohit was another highlight. Only issue was she got very less dialogues or else she could've overshadowed most of the star cast here. Fatima Sana Shaikh has given her weakest performance, she deserved a better role and better acting. While in Dangal and Thugs she had almost matched Aamir here her Dangal co-star(Sanya Malhotra) is taking over her, hope she improves upon in the future. Shalini Vatsa was also great in her role, her short yet sweet chemistry with Pankaj Tripathi would want you long for more. Asha Negi was wasted badly in an uninspiring role, hoped she gets better role in the future of Bollywood.Kudos to Basu for making Ludo possible, just wished it to be little longer in episodic format instead of series. Except the climax did become chaotic and loud, which kinda messes most of the part. Giving 7/10 as the climax kinda messes everything or else a 9 would've been perfect for this film"
253,Different characters and stories were very well stiched by Anurag Basu.Pankaj Tripaathi was super followed by Rajkumaar.
254,The way of Black comedy is not easy. But the director Anurag Basu handled it . Pankaj and rajkumars expression are unmatchable so funny. Loved the all actors. Must watch
255,"What a brilliant screenplay,cinematography and dialogues..Fantastic acting by all the cast and a brilliant music by Pritam and equally brilliantly sung by Arijit..Loved a bollywood movie after long long time..Subtle touch of Anurag Basu made it a gem..Its a nostalgic ride to Barfi,Metro,Jagga Jasoos.."
256,"Every actor in this movie shine in their respective roles. Four different stories who connect each other so well. All four stories are really different and unique.
Red (Abhishek Bachchan) story is the most emotional story, the scene where he met his daughter was very emotional.
Green(Rajkumar Rao, Fatima Sana Sheikh) story is the most hilarious story. Rajakumar Rao as Aloo is so great to watch. I couldn't stop laughing when Aloo would start dancing as mithoon.
The story of Yellow(Aditya Roy Kapoor, Sanya Malhotra) is a romantic touch given to the entire movie. They actually look so good together I would love to watch them together in future.
Blue(Rohit Saraf, Pearle Mane) is a silent story. The story is abit slow and well written but Rohit has done a great job.
Pankaj Tripathi in the movie is like the dice. He has the same Mirzapur touch of gangster but with comic trait. The most funny thing is he never dies. In one scene he is thrown of a bridge and he is still alive, then he falls from a dozer and yes he is still alive. In the end of the movie he is hit by a truck and still alive.
The movie has really convincing ending narrative manages to entertain us.
If you havent watched it yet than you are missing out alot."
257,"Most amazing screenplay in recent times. Anurag Basu is master of story teller and again he proved with this jem. All actors have comedbale job respectively. Little bit sad why this movie was not released in theater. Black comedy with such a ease. Again Hats off to anurag sir. Pankaj sir, Abhishek , Aaditya ,Saniya,Fatima,Rajkumar rao ,mama ji from SD and all other supporting cast act memorable"
258,After so long a really good Bollywood movie with some really good content to watch
259,"Must watch 10/10. Comedy, life truth and romantic movie."
260,"Pretty good and whimsical.The story and multiple intertwined threads are not new anymore, but you won't feel bored or feel any glaring clich√©s with this onePros :-Cinematography is excellentSongs and background scores are on point and pretty goodActing for most part is fresh and goodWell pacedCons :the clich√©s though not that bad, do stick outscript is hit and miss, and pretty awful at some pointsthe pace was good, but editing could have been a bit better, especially giving some more depth to few characters while chopping few pointless sequences ( like the murder for 7 lakhs - could have been shorter if not completely cut, while inserting why the builder was murdered or the older nurse etc. )"
261,"I found such a great movie after years from Bollywood. A perfect blend of everything. Romance, action, comedy, thrill everything and that too performed with absolute perfection. None of the cast felt overacting or seemed not able to go deep down the character. Absolute perfection. Even the role brought by fatima sheikh, a completely new character was brilliant. The beginning is so excellent that it grips you to watch entire movie in just 10 mins. Out of the box content and story. One of the best bollywood movies of all time. Managing so many casts is one of the most difficult task but Basu showed everything could be presented excellently, all you need is perfect cinematography and direction. The scenes and camera angles and all were so perfect. A MUST MUST MUST WATCH."
262,"The movie is very good in every way.
It contain everything like action, comedy, thriller, suspense, emotion.Loved it."
263,"A must watch muvi full of everything, it's just worth it to watch."
264,"Pankaj Tripathi and all other actors nodoubt have done a wonderful job to make it entertaining but the online thing that I think was not relevant was making fun of Indian mythology, I damn sure it was not done intentionally but it does affect somewhere.
Looking forward to get the best output next time."
265,"As usual Bollywood hateness towards Hindu culture and Hinduism, showing our ishwar in bad light. Ur day will also come basu and all the cast!"
266,"Mostly all the actors have done great job.....But RR & PT steal the show. Cinematography is what will keep you refreshed in this lengthy movie.....
Kudos to Anurag Basu for trying something new everytime.
So give it a try it wont disappoint."
267,"Nalla padam
Nalla padam
Nalla padam
Nalla padam
Nalla padam
Nalla padam"
268,"After a long time, an Indian movie with good story line, direction and screenplay. You don't want to miss any minute of movie because lot of things are happening in it. Pankaj Tripathi , Aditya Roy Kapoor, Sanya malhotra, Rajkumar Rao are rocking on screen. I think Abhishek Bachhan nailed his character, the only bad luck of Abhishek is Bachhan Sb sets the standards so high that it's not possible for him to meet that. Mini was so cute in her acting. The analogy between life and the game of Ludo is astoundingly depicted in this movie. Anurag Basu's cinematography has always created an apotheosis in Bollywood movies. To summarize, definitely worth watching this movie. From an ordinary story to an extraordinary narration it keeps you entertained from the very beginning to the end."
269,"Anurag basu as usual with fresh and new content. Performance of all actors are very good. Special mention for Pankaj Tripathi sir, Rajkumar Rao and Inayat Verma ( Mini ). Story, screenplay and direction are top notch. Highly recommend from my side. Thankyou."
270,After watching boring movies this was such a relief ...totally keeps you occupied and it's like a joy ride full of fun and turns . Loved it .. it was funny but with a twist !
271,"I just found it in Netflix, and since I had nothing to do I decided to give it a try, and my God what a movie it was. Great comedy, emotions, love, and everything. In my opinion it is one of the top ten Hindi film ever."
272,"Good acting and Comedy.
Story is unique.
Pankaj, Raj Kumar Rao, Abhishek Bachchan
Were phenomenal"
273,Loved the movie. All the characters were played so well!
274,"I am generous with a 9 cos i enjoyed it. Simple, aint no wannabe critic.
The film has genuine humor n amazing exploration of human behavior. It is a bit lengthy but ther is no melodrama or songs.
I laughed out wildly when Mark Zuckerberg Mishra's name was called out.
The scene wher the fat man's buttocks is on audiences' face while his dick is towards the character Rahul is hilarious.
The hospital escape scene is uproarious.
Rajkumar Rao with his mullet hair n Mithunda's antics stole the show.
The film has one helluva hot babe (Sana) with busty cleavage.
Aditya Roy Kapoor's subtle taunt (on media n votes) is spot on."
275,Its a great movie guys trust me U won't regret the time after watching this movie
276,"Best movie watched, brilliant acting by the cast and great comedy narration was good worth watch it. Make it a try you would love it"
277,"This movie require certain pre-requisite for an audience and is not for everyone, here are they
1. Intellectual level
2. Taste to dark humour
3. Third level narrative
4. Eye for detail
5. Watch it as if you hear a storyThis movie has extracted the best of all artist and the cast on the show, in case you fall in all 5 categories you will observe the movie as nice story telling concept and the icing on the cake shall be if you believe in karma or if you believe that everything happens by God be it good or bad.I am not going to share the plot here or would not lay emphasis on one particular actor or character but would lay emphasis on the fact that this how humans are in the ever changing demands that he created and is trying to meet them and what they get they are not thankful but they are when they struggle to get that.It's a beautiful story and a plot stating why it's important to realise what you are and how you influence others either good or bad.Anurag Basu you did a fantastic job"
278,Story - Acting - Screening - Comedy full enjoyable . My rating 7.5/10
279,"Anurag basu had some bad period, however he has shown lots of creativity in this movie. Finally netflix has some good hindi movie. Casting is top notch everyone did justice to their character. As amitabh bachchan is irrepressible so do Pankaj and Raj kumar. Also Abhishek and others actor were great."
280,"Story feels complex and not very engaging, comic movements are few and far, some story plots seems unnecessary or over dragged, except two stories of kidnapping and sex tape both other stories seems uninteresting while basu as narrator is not beneficial to any story as he engage in morality side of characters, every actor did decent job but Rao and tripathi shines in movie, technical aspect are okay, overall 6.5 /10 is my verdict."
281,"A well scripted movie with non linear screenplay,give it a try u gonna like it,I like the bittu character mostly"
282,"This dark comedy anthology is a mixture of emotions. Starting off from a bash of circumstances that gradually bring laughter and joy to the audience and ending with the note of fate and destiny, this movie is indeed spellbound. Some of you might find the story a bit lagging but trust me its worth a watch. From Pankaj Tripathi to Rajkumar Rao, the casting of this movie is brilliant. A moment of silence to Abhishek Bachchan's performance. He silently creeped into our hearts and made it cry. But it's not just him the other actors like Aditya Roy Kapur, Dangal fame Sanya Malhotra and Fatima Sana Shaikh, Rohit Saraf and with a bit of enthusiasm for the people from Kerala, Pearle Manney.The essence of this movie is the portrayal of the fact that fate has its mysterious ways of bringing things to us that we have always desired. Anurag Basu brought in the aspects of multi-narrative storytelling and the subjects like sin and virtues and second chances. Just like the unpredictable game of Ludo, the director brought the lives of his character into this game. The best part of this movie is the way every part of the story connects well and ends with a good note. This work of motion art will leave you smiling and awed till the end. Honestly in my opinion, it's been a while since I have seen such a good Bollywood movie.If you are having a bad day, make yourself a chai, log in to your Netflix account and give this one a watch.A feel-good, dark, humorous, heart warming movie."
283,"Indian black comedies are the perfect fusion of black humor and desi masala mix. It tells a grand story where lives of the characters get entangled. Life is a set of random events, just like a game of Ludo, where we may think we are in control of things, but we really are not. The roles of Yamraaj and his assistant Chitragupta as the disinterested observers added extra flavour in this high velocity drama."
284,"The story line wasn't great but it was fun to watch. Rajkumar Rao stole the show as usual, and surprisingly Abishek too!P.s Not one to watch with the family."
285,"Amazing movie.. Watched twice
All actors did a great job.
Big cheers to Pankaj tripathi and rajkumar rao..
Editing of the movie was really appreciable.
Well done"
286,"Amazing master piece by Netflix India. This movie keeps you at the edge of your seat with the twists and turns in the plot. Add superb performance of Pankaj Tripathi & Rajkumar Rao, with the strong direction of Anurag Bassu, Ludo will give you perfect blend of comedy with action."
287,"DIRECTION: 10
ACTING: 14 ( +1 Extra for Pankaj Tripathi, Rajkumar Rao & Abhisek Bachhan & Aditya Roy Kapoor)
MUSIC: 10
Reality: 6Finally a good movie in the year of Pandemic... Anurag Basu has ticked all the boxes. The Barfee's director impresses with Ludo also.
Netflix saved itselft from pathetic indian movie lists :p"
288,"Chaotic, beautiful, childlike and crazy genius is Anurag basu. His Ludo is chaotic brilliance. Cast and acting was great. And no words for direction..."
289,"This movie stands strong till the end..
One of the finest movies."
290,Some stupids gave it -ve for nepotism..but dude 1st watch the flim then rate
291,"It's a good movie mixing in 4 different stories and how Fate brings them 'together'. The movie brings up Fate, Destiny and the Dichotomy between 'Good' & 'Evil' in it's philosophical themes. I liked it. Another good movie in Anurag Basu's Filmography."
292,Anurag Basu creates a solid movie with some brilliant top notch performances especially by rajkumar rao and pankaj tripathy
293,"Just one word can define Ludo-AMAZING..!
I seldom write reviews but Its really such a rare gem to watch that I couldn't help to stop myself from expressing my excitement.
Don't befooled by the hater's negative reviews... Just give it a try... I can bet U won't be disappointed anyhow."
294,"This is my first IMDb review. I've rated many movies but never reviewed.
This movie is one of the best crime-comedy-drama I've ever watched in Indian Cinema.
Anurag Basu have done a great work. The movie is so very well directed that you wouldn't feel bored for a second.
To sum up in 3 words you will
""Laugh, Cry & Smile"""
295,This movie is unique and nice story amazing movie concept different
296,"You will from the start feel like you are watching the 2020 version of super deluxe with ofcourse different stories. And you will like it from the very first scene .
Rajkumar Rao and Abhishek are the best in the film, the little girl is surprise package.
Aditya and sanya gave commendable and natural performance and their chemistry is amazing."
297,"Basu has done fantastic work. The way different parallel stories are merged into one movie is fabulous. All actors were superb and their performance were upto the mark. Specially Junior Bacchan, Pankaj Tripathi and Raj kumar Rao. Pankaj Tripathi seems to be on path towards becoming next Amrish Puri (funny one). Must watch movie.."
298,"Just awesome... I am fully entertained!!!! I have to write more for the sake of IMDB's ""No short Review"". But truly a fun movie ."
299,"Raj kumar Rao what an actor and Tripathi undoubtedly performed exceptional as always
But please avoid casting boring Bachan always a let down.
Fab movie, script and direction
Thanks for finally making one good movie"
300,"Everything about the movie is good except for the climax which looks rushed and not well thought of unlike the rest of the movie. Movies flows at a rapid pace and all characters fit right in. Their paths cross for reasons well scripted into the story and it's convincing. Everyone has acted their parts flawlessly - Abhishek's character showcases anger and emotions, Pankaj's - Anger and Comedy, Rajkumar's - Comedy and Emotion and Aditya's - Comedy. Dangal girls have also done well in their respective parts. It's a fresh take on life and it's complexities and Anurag Basu delivers a gem!!"
301,"This movie is just superbly directed by Anurag Basu. So well narrated hyperlinks and small details. Rajkumar Rao, Pankaj Tripathi as usual classy act. Must watch movie."
302,"Ok, I need some extra sentences because there is a lot to say about this film. This was almost going to be another Jagga Jasoos (in post production standard, but somehow it got saved - you will feel like drinking those green juices which will be bitter if the sugar is just a gram less). Editing is super, it does not make you feel that in some of the scenes actors are not there standing together, even kudos to the body doubles. Even camera is, whatever scene transitions and outdoors of beautiful Ranchi and Bhilai, both of which used to be famous travel destinations in the early twentieth century. I loved the songs (listened the jukebox just after watching the film) and liked the concept of making different third and fourth acts (and they have colour motifs too); but all these could not make something GREAT together as this hyperlinks are not new in India where all the different South Indian film industries started experimenting with this format with the respective own local flavours for more than a decade now, and once a while Bollywood gives it a try too. Now, the characters, Pankaj Tripathy (the Die) has done a lot of gangsters already, so you will not get much other than the main USP of the character. Abhishek Bachchan and the kid (the Reds) has a cute segment, and the scene where the parents deciding to keep the maid was so strong that I reacted vocally during it. Fatima Sana Shaikh and Rajkumar Rao (the Greens) gave their fullest, specially the scenes with his hard acting and the conversations with his co-workers. Sanya Malhotra and Aditya Roy Kapoor (the Yellows) delivered as their scripts demanded, and the scene when her fiance came was real as anything. And without having many dialogues, both Pearle Maaney and Rohit Suresh Saraf (the Blues) drew attention from everybody and now I am searching for her filmography in Wikipedia. Just to show off, adapting the rules of a game to a film is done well, and executed in better way, if not similarly massive, to ""Animal World""."
303,"Okay, so it lived up to the hype of the trailer.
Great script, beautiful cinematography and amazing acting by all in the cast.
It's a rollercoaster and worth every minute!"
304,"Ludo-The wicked wicked game.
This is the latest offering by Netflix as their original feature film. Ludo the eponymous board game which everyone as a child would have played. Lately it seems to have caught on the fancy of young and old alike in it's online Avatar. It sounds like an unlikely name for a movie and does aroused curiosity. The movie juxtaposes this game as and with the game of life. One gets excited and is expectant to see something different or new, as for the last few offerings on the various OTT platforms are anything but entertaining or even vaguely logical, lt seems that the makers set out to make something good with the kind of themes and story ideas at their disposal but somewhere in the intervening period they lose their way and the story meanders and hurtles towards its climax. Same is the case with Ludo, it starts out with high expectations as a bearded Anurag Basu (the director of the movie) and his sidekick descend upon the screen with a briefcase. One feels some kind of Gangland exchange is going to happen but they turn out to be the Sutradharas and their conversation takes us forward to a floating Mafia den helmed by Sattu (Pankaj Tripathi) and his wacky gang. We are introduced to four sets of tales which are explained away as the four players of this game of Ludo. Though not interconnected but they keep crossing each other's paths as Sattu is the common thread or the canvas on which their existence hinges and who has the power to control them. The story keeps shifting from one set of players to another, in the process bumping into each other as on the ludo board and inflicting back to square one to each other. It finally boils down to the climax where all the four stories converge on a common ground literally and what follows is that different fate is handed over to different team. Some get just rewards and some just perish. And what about Sattu the unbreakable, the master controller of the pieces he is having a time of his life despite being the villain of the piece so what is the moral of story Live and Let die?
Now let's talk about the teams and the characters there in:
First, the yellow corner of the board : The Akash and Shruti story i.e. Aditya Roy Kapoor and Sanya Malhotra. A goldigger falls for a struggler and their love story goes viral, it has to be reversed, so who best but apna Sattu bhai who will lend a hand. Kapoor is maturing as an actor but still retains his cockiness. Sanya displays right amount of chutzpah. The ventriloquist doll is the highlight.
Second, in the green corner : Alok and Pinky story i.e. Rajkumar Rao and Fatima Sana Shaikh. A lovelorn majnu gyped in love by his paramour is forced at the hands of his heart to put in his all to save his beloved's family in trouble due th Sattu. Is ultimately rewarded by fate. Rajkumar is in top form mimicking Mithun and sporting a different look. Fatima is unable to shake off her pehelwan looks and even as a guntotting moll in minis does not evoke any desire.
Third the Red Corner: The Bittu story i.e. Abhishek Bachhan, the loser. Solitarily carry's on to give succor to his friend turned rival who has usurped his family, wife and all from him. Is the only one to be handed tragedy by fate. Bachhan shows absolute restraint and gives a fitting performance as the role demands.
Fourth the blue corner is the story of Rahul and Shreeja I.e. Rohit Saraf and Pearle Maaney. It is an unnecessary interlude but the fate is kindest to them as they finally realise their dreams of becoming millionaires a la Lootcase and Waisa bhi hota hai part II. Not much acting to their credit though they hog a lot of footage.
Finally we come to the granddad himself i.e. Sattu or Pankaj Tripathi who lives the Gita shloka of being indestructible only here we are not talking about his soul but his body (the soul is forever lost). With guns tied on his thighs a la femme Nikita under his lungi he and his gang act as the irritant louts but also the common thread that binds the narrative. Pankaj is in his usual laid back style and now we have seen him one too many times in the last 2-3 years. It seems he and Nawazuddin are the only character artists and dons left in the industry.
Some final observations: The female characters in all the four stories are shown the manipulative ones, even the child who plans her own kidnap has a hardened Bittu wrapped round her fingers. The male protagonists are their saviours, how naive. The movie finale gives us the parting kick as the Director and his sidekick are dipicted as dhan-ta-dan....Yama and Chitragupta, well, well, well......so much for the mytho."
305,"Ludo is that light entertainer which you may not want to miss. The movie started off really well, but felt it lost its way in the middle. The concept of mixing many stories with many characters, adding confusion to create comedy and curiosity is a concept used for decades, but the colourful frames, background music and brilliant editing ensured that a scent of freshness persisted throughout the movie. Pankaj tripathi's smile and head movements are enough to make anyone's day, he is the heart of the movie. Loved performances of all actors especially Aditya Kapoor, saniya malhotra and inayat verma (from where are they getting these talented kids?.) I loved the movie and will go back to it again and again whenever I feel down, just like the game of ludo.
NB: I think the director just writes off the concept of good and sin, right and wrong, and karma by deciding the fate of his characters in a way that doesn't satisfy our moral codes.."
306,"‚≠ï‚≠ï‚≠ï‚≠ï‚≠ï‚≠ï‚≠ï‚≠ï‚≠ï‚≠ï‚≠ï
Please go and watch it.
The story and dialogue is perfect.
Every actor in this film played their role so well.
As expected Pankaj Tripathi will never upset you with his acting skills.
How the 4 story merges is awesome.
A total masala movie"
307,"In this year where old films are being remade or film with crappy acting and plots are coming.This feels like a fresh story where 4 lives are interconnected in a 1 epic funny thriller story ,the plot is fresh the acting is superb there were a few dry spell butter story keeps u engaged through out the movie. All in all the acting of all the actors is great,We get connected to all of these lives in a few moments in the start of the movie itself such that anything happening to them makes us sympathize or feel about them from heart. The songs are nice. Definitely watch it with family."
308,"Instead of ""Ludo"", Anurag Basu's chaotic comedy should be called ""Snakes N Ladders"", as it mounts some high hijinks but also lulls low on other occasions. The writer-director's vision, as lofty as his previous outing (WATCH JAGGA JASOOS), is still slightly let down by the execution. But I will never get enough of this one-of-a-kind way he crafts his kooky world.It ain't perfect, but definitely a touch above the usual crop of crap we get every week."
309,I don't like this movie. It's total waste of time.
310,"If you interested in watching two and a half hours of crap with an ensemble of established actors, look no further Anurag Basu has the right stuff for your taste. It would enrich your cerebral cortex with new concepts of comedy, thrill & drama. Enough to wipe out slightest amount of remnant intelligence. What more can you expect from a bygone director?"
311,"The movie starts well and then we see a lot of badly edited shots put together by a purely written screenplay to introduce the characters.
Then we see some random events taking place while trying to maintain a link of the characters to the main story line and then we hit the 90 minute mark where the film runs out of screenplay.
The director then weaves a loose concoction if another 75 minutes, half of which is filled with songs which sound like they've been a part of numerous other movies.
At the end of it all, I realise I've wasted almost 3 hours on a weekday and that I cannot give below 1 star.
The extra star is for Rajkumar Rao and Fatima, coz that is the only segment that was interesting."
312,Best entertainment of 2020 along with equally wonderful acting from everyone(Rajkumar Rao nailed it)
313,"A fun thrilling roller coaster ride with good performances from all the actors . Bollywood is always evolving this one is a perfect example for it after watching barfi I was a huge fan of Anurag Basu but some of his last ventures were not up to the mark ,but this one shows the capability of Anurag Basu .I loved it so much you don't want to miss this fun ride give it a try you won't be disappointed."
314,Quiet impressed with the storyline miss these kind of films in bollywood
315,"This is a must watch. Very well directed , scripted, acted. The whole cast has done really well. I was just happy to see abhishek."
316,That one star for only Rajkumar Rao!! . But just boycotting whole bullywood! It's necessary to show these vultures their real place!!
317,Tatti lovers will give more than 2 stars to this movie
318,This movie makes no sense at all. Lacks clarity and very confusing. Great actors not utilised properly. A lot missing. Every character is going over board and trying to over do the role.
319,Despite the fact that the movie is super boring.. You will have to see abhishek bachans face for 2 hours 30 mins.. Good luck to you if you want to survive that.
320,Boring movie...pathetic music...save your time...better play a game of ludo online..
321,"Several scenes in the movie were unnecessary and looked like forcefully put inside the story for whatsoever reason god only knows. Personal attacks on Jornalists whom you cant dare to confront and cow jibe on Hindus because they are the tolerant species. I tell you Bollywood You are because of Us, just remember that; but we are not because of you. If you want to gain respect know how to give respect. Time is running out so mend yourself."
322,Again insult hindu gods why why they doing that becouse we not take any action
323,"Do not take 20th century audience for granted!!
I thought at least this is a good movie with content. Disappointed when I saw our deity being ridiculed.
To bring out humour why desperately targeting Hindu sentiments?"
324,Same old ramleela comedy again... Many old movies already available on same theme
325,This movies promotes anti India agenda so I boycott this movie.
326,Lowly secular worms are at it again.. insulting hindu belief and rituals is the trend among the bollywoodias. The problem is that these lowly creatures keep insulting hindu religion only or else they won't find their heads on their shoulders. Shameless. Thooo.
327,"Disgusting movie which shows anti-indian culture, which makes fun of Arnab Goswami for being a nationalist!! Bollywood tries so hard to be modern, but instead they end up being so regressive with their anti-nationalist agenda! #BoycottBollywoodCompletelyForever"
328,"Yet another disaster and agenda driven movie...ai request instead of wasting Ur time for this, better use that to help needy ones."
329,"Ludo is life! Life is Ludo!Whether you win or lose in Ludo, the ultimate goal for every player is to get all their 4 tokens past round one and to the finish line without being eliminated in the process by the opposing teams. There are 4 color teams which are yellow, red, green, and blue.Each story is coded by color and how the game plays a major role in those stories. The characters from each of those 4 stories cross paths with each other and the cause of that is through one major character, a crime boss named Rahul Satyendra Tripathi a.k.a Sattu.Yellow: Akash Chauhan, a ventriloquist and stand-up comedian and his ex-girlfriend, Shruti Choksi who is getting married in 3 days find out that they were taped while having sex and their video ends up on the internet.

His wife has a huge debt that needs to be cleared by Sattu. Mini is a six year old girl who is fed up by her parent's attention so she stages her own kidnapping with Bittu being the abductor after meeting. Bittu see this as an opportunity to use the ransom to pay the debt. Bittu looks at Mini like his own daughter and develop this strong bond.Green: Pinky suspects her husband is having an affair but he gets arrested for the murder of a builder who was actually killed by Sattu. Pinky takes help from her school friend Alok Kumar a.k.a Aloo, a die hard Mithun fan who runs a diner along with his former gang buddies. She asks Aloo to help get her husband out of jail by first having to pay money to the mistress who her husband was having an affair with so she can give her statement to prove his innocence and takes shortcuts to get that amount of money.Blue: Rahul Avasthi is a salesman who always faces reprimands from his boss and Sheeja Thomas, a Malayali nurse who is often teased by her colleagues for not knowing Hindi. Rahul comes home and witnesses a dead body in front of him. That body belongs to the builder that Sattu killed. He gets kidnapped by Sattu and is taken to his den which explodes in the process. Rahul and Sheeja meet while being transported in an ambulance with the crime boss on the gurney. The vehicle crashes, both Sheeja and Rahul dump Sattu in a lake even though he survives, and flee with his money. So now they're on the run.Anurag Basu as the director and DOP of the film decided to introduce a similar way of storytelling just like his previous film Life in a Metro. Basu's concept is loosely based on the board game Ludo and how opposing teams cross paths.The key point of the narrative was to immediately see the crossing of each story but this one was a bit all over the place. I don't get the idea of one story happening while characters from the other story appear in the background. Cross sequences will just make a story dry and out of context. The dialogues where whimsical and funny which can make the audience chuckle at times but the story was just a slight mess. The predictability of the story grew quite a lot at times but compare it with Jagga Jasoos, this one stands out much more than his previous film. It wasn't on the levels of boredom and this one will keep you on the edge of your seat. It was still a smart idea to use Ludo as a tool to tell a Black Comedy story.There is a specific sequence throughout the film where Anurag Basu is narrating the story of the film to Rahul Bagga through a game of Ludo and walking through each engaging scene explaining the effects and fates of each character.Yellow: Aditya Roy Kapur is potentially getting somewhere and his performance was earnest in a way that his ventriloquism will keep you entertained. Sanya Malhotra was very energetic and humorous but her acting didn't have much engagement. Their love story and chemistry were the achilles heel of the film.Red: Abhishek Bachchan implemented the role of a former gangster perfectly if you take his character Lallan Singh from Yuva but his characterization barely came out and his command of speaking was very low. Inayat Verma performed flawlessly as Mini and she was very sweet and cunning throughout the movie. The bond between both the characters is what saved the narrative but the fate in the end became a compromise. Asha Negi's debut as Bittu's ex-wife still showed hope and she has potential of becoming a good actressGreen: Rajkummar Rao was the true winner of this film and his performance as the Mithun fan diner owner managed to set a new standard. He was funny and he nailed the foul language as well as his dance moves. Fatima Sana Shaikh plays Pinky Jain really nicely and her precision was watchable as a motherBlue: Rohit Suresh Saraf had a very lukewarm performance as a runaway salesman as he barely spoke although he delivered a few dialogues. Pearle Maaney's performance was flat and very ordinary. She spoke a few dialogues in English and Malayalam throughout the film but she failed to add anything.Pankaj Tripathi as Rahul Satyanand ""Sattu"" Tripathi managed to nail every aspect in the book. He was dark, gritty, engaging, funny, and stood out amongst the crowd as the best performance after Rao. The Nurse Kutty also performed well who helped in Sattu's recovery as well as developing a romantic connection with him.Music is the only concerning factor even though Arbaad Barbaad is a good track but the standards of Pritam's magic is slowly deteriorating and it is lacking the rhythm to make the album enjoyable.The the song ""Qismat Ki Hawa Kabhi Naram, Kabhi Garam"" which was both the murdered victim and Sattu's favorite song. This kind of did add a new vibe to this anthological black comedy.Cinematography was also done by Anurag Basu as well as Rajesh Shukla. They did a good job with the visuals and it made the film very colorful and the serenity was solace.Overall, The only tokens that stay in their spot and aren't playable are the sub-par narrative and Music. The active playing Tokens (Acting, DOP work, Direction, and characterization/humor). This is a game you won't regret! Despite its minor loopholes, this one is watchable.3/5 - Wish this released in cinemasStreaming on Netflix"
330,"This is an enjoyable watch. It is fast paced, and very funny in some parts. There is also unexpected emotional heft in some scenes. I would have rated it higher but for the cluttered feel. Basu is a skilled director and obviously has a creative mind brimming with ideas. The trouble is that he is too indulgent and crams too many of his ideas into each of his movies. More discipline and less clutter would have elevated this movie to another level."
331,"This is another one of the long list of the hinduphobic pieces of garbage Bollywood produces. Hence I don't want to waste my time explaining the technicals of the film cause I don't care how good they are. If you are a Hindu phobic putting hinduphobic content into your movies without any reason (cause hinduphobic stuff is added for no reason in here, out of nowhere) then the movie is trash. It's as simple as that. Don't waste your time watching this movie. Lesson should be taught to any person who thinks they could make hinduphobic content and get away with it"

333,I don't recommend this movie as story is not at the current standard.
334,"Just Amazing üíñ, AB you killed it mast, all have done fine acting."
335,Bravo Mr. Basu for this gem. This is the best of all OTT releases in 2020. Everything was perfect..üëçüëç
336,"Ludo (2020) :
Movie Review -Since the corona pandemic and lockdown bollywood audience has got literally nothing watchful that can be enjoyed like a real good film and then some films tried to gain benefit through OTT release. But these OTT releases saw huge drop in number of audience and in quality of films. Now it's fair to say that the new joining in the list is this human anthology directed by Anurag Basu called Ludo. When there were no expectations after goofy trailer, Ludo was unexpectedly looking a clever film and was almost certain to end as an Unexpected Diwali Dhamaka and suddenly last 20-25 minutes pulled it down to join the said elite club.Ludo has multiple stories connected to each other somehow, some way, somewhere and so the plotting settles nicely at the beginning. The introduction scenes of this big cast takes lot of time but not harmful at all due to entertaining and engaging storytelling. Every charcter is established perfectly and almost every character provides some genuine laughters and hilarious scenes. Especially, Rajkummar Rao and Pankaj Tripathi have got some hysterical and interesting dialogues. The rest of the characters are normal yet connectable because of simplicity. Ludo gains more momentum with the narration theory handled by Yamraj and some adult stuff involved in it.Acting wise as already mentioned Rajkummar Rao and Pankaj Tripathi are the table toppers followed by Aditya Roy Kapoor, Fatima Sana Sheikh and Sanya Malhotra. The supporting cast is okay but most importantly everyone has got enough screentime to make an impact. It's the writing of the characters which doesn't show same cleverness to every character, some are blessed with intelligence while some are cursed and totally destroyed. The destruction of characters feels strong in last 30 minutes when they are seen doing rubbish and insensible things.Ludo is 150 minutes long film and still has enough grip to hold you on your seat. However, couple of songs are damn boring and useless which fooled the editor's eyes. Dialogues are too funny and has vulgar touch, afterall it's Netflix and without abusive language they are incomplete. No doubts, the dialogues make you laugh, make you think sometimes even though the presentation of that particular scene is rough. Ludo could have been a great anthology if there was no melodrama and dumb romance because in crime dramas you don't want typical emotions to jeopardize entire smart narrative. Anurag Basu first promises you a clever film set in dramatic mess and then himself makes dumb moves to solve the mess. How disappointing it was to see this surprisingly good film going down as expected before those surprises. Overall, Ludo is just another average flick saved by some funny scenes even though at early stage it was way ahead of expectations.RATING - 5/10*"
337,I loved it. Rajkumar rao abd Pankaj ji have done a very good job. Intact every in this movie have shared equal screen time which is indeed a very good thing. Apart from this... the story too was impressive. And the ending was stunning.üòÜ
338,Absolutely rubbish movie. Waste of time!! Poor direction and a bad storyline filled with unnecessary songs.
339,Have watched this movie and found it absolutely abhorring ..AVOID AT ALL COST
340,"The worst movie ever, Shame on you Bollywood, totally waste of time and money, don't watch this movie"
341,"When bollywood will get some maturity, class and intellect to make good quality movies and shows????"
342,It's one time watch though too long a movie. Nothing new. Just a timepass. Becomes like one of Rohit shetty movie at the end.
343,"Why always to defame Hinduism in name of entertainment . Why Temple, Hindu God, cow, Goddess only targetted ?
Avoid to see such nonsense movies ."
344,Offensive movie. Basu probably thinks it's cool to make caricatures of Sanathan dharma for an audience who are followers of the same dharma. Are we so brainwashed that we allow such sacrilegious content? I challenge Basu to substitute the characters of our dharma with other abrahamic religions and check the backlash? Too scared Basu?
345,Clich√© woke nonsense 'dark' comedy. Direction falls flat with a bland screenplay.
346,"Poor implementation of script, pathetic Stitch pattern.. overall waste of time and money"
347,There are scenes which are unrelated to the story of the film. The scenes are very disgusting and hinduphobic
348,Another addition to Hinduphobia by Urduwood/Karachiwood. Also not worth your time
349,"Do not watch this Bigoted Web series which insults Hindus. This use of artistic freedom to mock Lord Ram should be boycotted and Blocked in every way. Spread the word, This web is not worth a watch. Instead of this spent time with ur family and donate money to Poor."
350,Cheap minded director can't make a film without mocking Hindus And their Devta. These days it's a common practice of making fun of Hindu Faith for cheap publicity.
351,"This movie is full of hinduphobic content, I request people to give it one star,"
352,"Full of Hypocrisy. In this movie.
Abusing hindu god. Making fun of hindu deties.
That's the main reason i dont like this movie.."
353,"What PK tried to do, this movie takes it further. Constant mocking on Hinduism and Hindu godd."
354,Just yet another Hindu-phobic movie from Bollywood.
355,"This movie is one of the fine architectural sign.
Perfect direction, nice story , great acting by everyone. Must watch"
356,"Ludo delivers on the expectations I had from Barfi. Where Barfi fell flat, Ludo soars. Very fun to watch! Pankaj Tripathi, sir, take a bow! This man is a chameleon. He shape-shifts into different roles with so much ease, and commands every scene he is in! Abhishekh brings some memories from his 'Yuva' days, but he melds into his role as the movie progresses. The cute little sweetheart with Abhishekh steals the show! Aditya, Sania, Rajkummar, Fatima - all are well cast, and keep the movie going. You kind of expect what will happen in the end, but there are lots of twists and turns to keep the audience guessing and entertained!"
357,"Must Watch,
Pankaj Mishra, Raj Kumar Rao, Abhishek Bachchan, Sanya Malhotra ...all are awesome..
But above all of them...
The little cute girl has won the heart from her acting."
358,Best movie comedy action everything and ending superb happy ending
359,"While we have adored the content of diverse and unique film which were released on OTT this year, we have certainly missed few Bollywood flicks which could have been enjoyed in theaters. Anurag Basu directed comic-caper, Ludo, is one of its kind which would have done wonders if released in theaters across the country.Just like the game itself, Ludo gives you four different dimensions - Bittu (Abhishek Bachchan) who desperately need 90 lakhs to see his daughter and performs a fake kidnapping with help of Mini (Inayat Verma), Akash (Aditya Roy Kapur) who needs to rescue his ex-girlfriend Shruti (Sanya Malhotra) from getting shamed as their sex video has gone viral over the internet, Alok (Rajkummar Rao) who does everything under the sun to help his childhood love, Pinky (Fatima Sana Sheikh), who in turn wants to help her husband out of jail, Rahul (Rohit Saraf), an ordinary salesman whose life turns topsy-turvy when he becomes the witness of a murder and runs away to save his life only to meet Sheeja (Pearle Maaney), a Malayali nurse who does not know a word of Hindi or English. All these stories are woven around a common man - Sattu (Pankaj Tripathi), a local goon, who is the main player rolling his dice in this game of criss-cross.Adapting the same concept of multiple stories with common theme in Life In A Metro, director Anurag Basu (also playing the role of Yamdooth) makes Ludo a complete entertainer leveraged with fun-loving characters, crossing each other's path. As the story involves multiple stories with diverse characters and their sub-stories, it might take some time for you to digest Ludo but once you are in the game, there is no turning back as the players move forward with their own agenda.While the first half is hilarious, the second half loses the focus with few stories unnecessary elongated which could have easily been trimmed. As there are separate stories and their sub-stories involved, it becomes confusing sometimes. Nevertheless, the climax is pretty neat with a good happy ending. Anurag Basu has created a different genre of gangster drama with a pinch of comic relief in the Indian Cinema and just like his previous films Life In A Metro and Barfi, Ludo boast off enigmatic camera work (Basu is credited for it). Art direction was gorgeous. Music by Pritam is soulful. On the flip side, the editing needs attention as the film drags for sometime. Dialogues are superb and hilarious.Though Ludo is a multi-starrer, you will fall in love two characters - Sattu played by Pankaj Tripathi and Alok a,k.a Alu played by Rajkummar Rao. The versatile actors emote so accurately through their facial expression that it is difficult to imagine anyone else in their characters. Both actors are funny, witty, and impressive with perfect timing of body language. Abhsiehk Bachchan was just about okay. The Dangal girls - Sanya Malhotra and Fatima Sana Sheikh are fine in their part. Aditya Roy Kapur is impressive. I liked the roles played by Rohit Saraf and Pearle Maaney. The actor who played the role of lead nurse opposite Pankaj Tripathi was equally good.Overall, Ludo is sure to entertain you throughout the film which will make you laugh-a-loud. Must watch - 3.5/5.Ludo is produced by Anurag Basu and Bhushan Kumar under the banner of T-Series, Anurag Basu Productions and Ishana Movies. Ludo is currently streaming on Netflix platform."
360,"You wont need tranquilizers after this trash. This will numb your mind and make you brain dead. And it will happen fairly quickly too. Pathetic direction, equally pathetic acting. Senseless script. The biggest tragedy is reduction of actors like pankaj tripathi and raj kumar rao to caricatures. Last but not least, leftist fanatic attacks on media, cow and usual abusive denigrating of Ramayan and ram lila. Whew! But most importantly, it was a trashy trashy film. One which anyone with a semblance of intelligence wouldn't b able to sit through. I couldn't."
361,"Worst movie against hindus just like pk, they will never show allah cartoon but they all show hindu god and goddess"
362,Boycott all bollywood lobbies. Don't watch their movies.
363,"This movie matches to the poor standard of comedy direction of Bollywood.
Acting 3/10
Direction 2/10
Story 2/10
Urdu music 5/10
Urdu dialogues 2/10"
364,"Just another new age ""quirky"" movie they are trying to sell as funny."
365,First of all look at there attempt of shaming people against them. For most it a lame movie full of Nepotism and shameless putting there agenda against the government. Now a days they think they can change people prospective by shaming government but it show how successful they are by election results. No one give a dam what they say . Also if Aranb is sitting on the laps of government it is imminent that they are sitting ok the laps of anti nationalist elements. People will decide whom to follow. This way the support for government only grows stronger because people are not low minded as they are.
366,"Third class series, full of useless overacting and jargon."
367,"Super entertaining! The actors have done an excellent job, especially Mr. Pankaj Tripathi. Mr. Basu has yet again come up with good content and is pretty cute as Yamraj too. This film deserves the big screen. It's a dark comedy and people who say it's confusing or boring, kindly get back to your saas bahu serials. I've read the reviews here and I'd just like to say there's not a single scene that makes fun of any religion."
368,"For once the faith in the Indian Film Industry is reinstated thanks to Basu's ensemble comedy that revolves around the lives of different people and it shows how life itself has a connect to each person existing on Earth. How the serendipity works and somewhere we are all connected within the Matrix. Life is a matter of causality and that's something which is well narrated in the script. It's a fresh break from the mindless slapstick comedy which the whole Comedy genre has reduced to. The slight nuances of each of the characters takes the movie forward in a smooth and brilliantly woven manner, much like the Tapestry of life is woven by the Fates. The story isn't in the magnanimity, the story is found in the little intricate details which have been highlighted in such a brilliant manner that words would fail to describe what a genius mind could think of such things along with having a great observation towards life. The Song opening the film ""O Betaji"" to the slight ""Dance of Sadness"" really defines how life is ""Kabhi Narm, Kabhi Garm."" Little aspects that only true lovers of art can notice and appreciate. Even though it is categorized as a Comedy, there are layers and shades to each character that makes you feel there's a connect to each of them. Somewhere there's a Devil and an Angel in each of us and that's portrayed beautifully on the canvas. This should have been a theatrical release and it should be running on all other platforms so that it reaches more and more people. Along with that, each actor in the film has given their best, be it Abhishek Bachchan's rawness, or Rajkumar Rao's obsession, to the little Babu's smile and Chiku's love requital to the little girl. Till we have filmmakers like Anurag Basu, the Film Industry shall be running well. It is a film beyond what mediocre minds can fathom as it is years ahead in its approach and execution. People who are intrigued by World Cinema would agree. We await more tales to be narrated by the sheer brilliance of Basu's mind!"
369,"Full of Hinduphobic activity, need not to be movie like this, shame on movies like this"
370,"Just make fun out our sentiment, why so much hate towards Hindus."
371,"Totally cringe and hinduphobic movie...
Bad for children and adults and can rise riots"
372,"There's no plot, anything and everything happens... every character makes lame and dumb decisions. There's no substance in any role. A waste of 2.5 hours. Sad i wasted my time with this."
373,"You really think people watch this ch! nese rap!! Buy books from gita press or if u want to watch then watch old movies from 1930s and 1940s which had original content, creativity and no disrespect against anyone. Jai shri ram"
374,Such a waste of time plus Hinduphobic movie. Everyone should boycott movies who don't respect other religions
375,"Oh boy, there is nothing new here. Basu tries to club in the subtlety of Life in a Metro with charming Barfi but fails to impress. Basu is attempting to impress by affecting greater importance or merit than is actually possessed.Child actors are used to act way beyond their age and maturity like it used to be in 70s. Characters are also found to be obvious and story line does get predictive."
376,The entire script is camouflaged with scenes that deliberately insult cultures and traditions.
377,Don't believe in the 1 star reviews and comments. Those who gave those I'm sure either those are intentional to defame the movie or the reviewers are Pogo or Nick channel viewer who don't have the judgemental skills of good cinematography. Please watch the movie and decided by yourself. It's worth giving two & half hours of your precious time.
378,"This movie is cinematic dream.....supported by brilliant cast and acting ....with eye catching cinematography...missed it in threaters
Released on my birthday....glad to have this cinematic gift"
379,This movie is a complete waste of time.It can be compared to Dhinchak Pooja song
380,"It's beyond me that in an industry where no one spoke out against the injustices infront of their eyes, they are still watched. Its the principle for all bollywood films and actors - they all decided to stay quiet knowing how many sentiments were being hurt. Also how it is acceptable to still support druggists and people in involved in drugs and criminal activities, is this what you want for a better India, for people to believe this is acceptable. Its the bigger picture, when it matters the most, no one spoke and this is cowardly behaviour."
381,"If you like propaganda, spewing poison on Hindus then this movie is for you."
382,Hateful and hinduphobic content just to please some sickulars
383,Bollywood comes again with Anti-sanatan stories full of mockery for Sanatan Dharma
384,Saying very bad looks very less for this film it's highly disappointing and did not expect Rajkumar to select such scripts !
385,Poor execution. Poor values and script. Full on community bashing
386,A deliberate farcical attempt at maligning the traditions and indigenous culture.
387,"Not Good ! May the curse of devi draupadi be felt & experienced in this life for all the kurus , the dhritrashtras and their friends involved in this film from thought to execution to theatres ! Jai shree krishna ! May you reveal urself and save the dharma"
388,Very unnecessary scenes inserted. Why are such type of nonsense is being created in the name of FoE.
389,"This movie is worst ever then Sadak thu
Don't waste your time
You will regret after watching this movie"
390,Wahiyaad movie.... Criticised Arnab Goswamy Indirectly.... Bad story telling...... Boring... Boring.... Boring......
391,"Terrible.. Basu's brazen attempt to make a Guy Ritchie like dark comedy. Overacting by mostly except for maybe Pankaj Tripathi. There is no story, no really, it's just many stories put together, at the end of the film try and tell the story to someone, you'll know what I mean. Go watch Snatch or Lockstock on repeat instead."
392,Is this going to be future of bollywood after non sense love stories??
393,"Not watching Bollywood movies till they get their act right and deserve to portray some
Character in real life"
394,Only bright spot Rajkumar Rao acting.very slow and Anurag Basu you list your touch it seems badly because of your alliance
395,Bad screenplay and story telling isn't done well. Bad attempt
396,"Plenty of things to do to utilize your time.
If you wanna waste the precious seconds then continue watching bollywood movies."
397,A totally flop movie. No story no script.. instead after 10 mins I played ludo with my family. It was more entertaining
398,"These days Anurag Kashyap's tweets are the basis for whether to watch a movie or not. If he tweets in favor of the movie, it means it is going to be an overrated movie which Bollywoodiya's will tweet in favor of to scurry favors for each other. So Anurag Kashyap goes around scratching everyone's back in the hope that they scratch his when a movie of his releases. Since the movie is getting overrated reviews, time to give it a 1 to balance out the fake superlatives."
399,"Dont watch any bollywood movie because bollywood only values nepotism.
they dont let latented actors to grow and suppress them or even kill them."
400,"Just like Sanju another movie to whitewash a few people and defame a few others. The hero enters the scene with a joke on Arnab Goswami the journalist who's been targeted by the state agencies, drug & bollywood mafia."
401,"Pathetic movie, pathetic Bollywood.
Pathetic movie, pathetic Bollywood.
Pathetic movie, pathetic Bollywood.
Pathetic movie, pathetic Bollywood."
402,Boring compared to thre rest out there. Hoped a bettwr performance from the actors. Not worth it
403,"When the movie started, I could see shades of Super Deluxe, the Tamil hot movie. It's constructed on similar lines. Four separate stories run parallel.
What I liked: 1) The acting of Pankaj Tripathi and Rajkumar Rao. 2) The incerpts of black comedy 3) The way same scenes are presented again from a different character's point of view
What I didn't like: 1) The subtle and not so subtle mocking of Hindu Gods, religion, traditions and beliefs. Most of this mocking was lame and had nothing to do with the storyline. For example, a) What was the need to make a mockery of Ramlila? Rao's character could have been introduced in some other way. b) What was the need to introduce the three actors playing roles of Hindu Gods and mock them by making them push a vehicle? How did their presence tie in with the story in any way? This was a straight lift from a similarly irrelevant scene in the movie, PK c) The reference to gaumutra....again, why?
2) The characters of the sutradhar and his sidekick. What were they doing there, spouting gibberish in the name of philosophy? This shows that the director is not satisfied with telling a story and allowing the audience to make up it's mind
What could have been a wacky comedy like ""Delhi Belly"" gets manipulated into a vehicle to sell a pseudo-secular agenda
For that, it deserves 1/10
It had the potential, but sadly didn't deliver"
404,"Hindu phobic content not acceptable ! Urudwood /bullydawood better get this once n for all! Please no gaslighting audience ,or denigrating hindu faith ! Go and get the pirs/ maulanas and sufi saints as lampoon objects ! Stop selling dross on nameof creativity! This is. Sham!"
405,Totally Bakbas movie watesting of time and money. Bycott Bollywood movies
406,"Useless to watch it, it's hinduphobic and tries to kocks gods and custom.It seema vulgar dialogues are only left to get audiences"
407,Film is filled with Hinduphobia. It's Urduwood and not Hindi film industry.
408,"Not at all good.
I was expecting it from atleast this much disappointmentüëéüò°"
409,Really liked every character.... N well portrayed by d writer.. I am not a critic.... But after 6 month this is d first tym I'm watching a moving without forward.... Very second worth watching best
410,"The film is lengthy that's all. Great Acting, Dark Humor and Screenplay is tight. Must watch if you are bored with the typical simple stories and South Indian movie remakes.I recommend it."
411,It came as a surprise. a great movie from Bollywood after andhadhun
412,The movie is too good and entertaining. Storyline and Actors performance was brilliant
413,"Direction, acting, comedy, action, emotions, every aspect of the movie was beautiful along with a philosophical message in the end. This would have been a big hit in a theater but we got to watch it during these times on Netflix. Definitely definitely worth a watch"
414,"A perfectly blended mixture of everything..Keep you stick to it till the last moment. Such brilliant storyline, cinematography, direction and of course acting skills. And music aha! Couldn't get better üî•üî•"
415,"Abhishek bacchan nailed the acting,Pankaj Tripathi and Rajkumar rao also did a great job"
416,I really enjoyed the movie all the characters stories I really like the writing and the it was very nice it was very entertaining it holds you up till the last and I totally loved the movie it's a must watch for all the audiences.
417,"Another Awesomeness by Anurag! Life is a game between birth and date; open and closure balance to be equalized at the conclusion. So do not leave the game. Pankaj Tripathi here with his all awesomeness, Aditya memes his great charm here.The AB Junior done his all time best role ever. story, screenplay, editing and music makes this movie a timepiece, meanwhile a great masterpiece! What a fabulous storyline....!"
418,Every body did brillant work but rajkumar roa and Pankaj Tripathi nailed their characters. Both of them were fantastic. Their screen presence and cic timing was hilarious. They have never played such diverse character but still they nailed it. And the actress who qwa
419,And the whole cast did an excellent job and again Anurag Basu deliver a masterpiece.
420,"Best movie of 2020.
Chalo kuch to accha hua 2020 m."
421,"A true masterpiece movie.
Couldn't guess the plot even till the last minute.
Wish this got released on the big screen."
422,Probably the best thing that happened in 2020.. u will enjoy every single minute of the movie...
423,Such a worst movies to watch. I feel boring during all the time. Not a worthy movies to watch.
424,Trailer and movies oky like time pass one watch. Bollywood like copy paste movie no great fun
425,"It seems interesting at the beginning but then you find there is no logic anymore and it never ending! Also, dont know when will Bollywood stop insulting Hindu gods?"
426,Tortureüò†üò°üò§...full.of hinduphobia....characters making fun and abusing hindu deities for no good reason...total cringe!!
427,The worst movie. Don't want bullywd anymore. These ghtiya druggies ppl don't deserve our love.
428,"LET'S DEPRESS BOLLYWOOD. Everyone has realised that these Bollywood fraternity r COWARD who cannot open their mouth 4 the JUSTICE OF THEIR OWN COLLEAGUES Really Shameful? We all were unnecessarily wasting our Time & Money on their Flop Movies. BOYCOTT & DEPRESS THEM PERMANENTLY.There is a sizeable number of TRAITORS in Bollywood who r here to propagate the agenda of ISI Agents. What for u are here, leave this country & go wherever u want to. No Indians r interested in you nor in your movies. Don't be a burden on our country. Beware of these Traitors."
429,I didnt like this movie no sense! And bollywood ü§£ waste of time and money
430,"If there was a rating less than 1, I would have opted for that
Another slimy movie that adds unnecessary masala targeting Hindu faith as a laughing stock. A movie releasing on Deepavali, systemically targeting RamLeela when Soorpanekha uses slangs and beats the Ram character on stage. This is the idea of dark comedy by Leftist mafia.
Then Hindu God role playing characters - Shiv, Hanuman etc. are shown pushing the car to gear start and the kid girl is making faces and making fun of them - This is the idea of Dark comedy by Leftist Mafia
And then there is that ventriloquist scene by Aditya Kapoor in which he uses the puppet to parrot another left propaganda - Cows get votes in our country. then makes fun of the only RW reporter Arnab - All in all, the left has become a desperate lobby that introduces unwanted, unwarranted scenes as masala that have no relevance with the story line - only to induce Anti Hindu sentiments and mock Nationalist vibes."
431,Another garbage from Bollywood. Problem with Bollywood is not the right cast and talented actors left behind. Nepotism and untalented nepotism kids ruin the indian movie platform.
432,Zero on content. Utilize your time on some better stuffs
433,"Initial 30-40 min movie is good, after that what they want to show and what they want to achieve they can only tell. Even if you sleep for 40 min in between, you won't miss and will be able to catch up with movie, if you still want to watch.
Pankaj tripathi good as always, Abhishek does same acting like tree so is Aditya roy kapoor.
In every movie they will have Muslim guy but not in this, because it has Yamraj in it, which Hindu believe so putting muslim guy might hurt their religious sentiment but they are making fun of hindu gods again like in every other movie."
434,"I wasted my time and money, there is fiction which clearly look pathetic directions."
435,Another jehadi movie... Bollywood has no quality... I m fool that i tried to watch another bollywood movie
436,Deducting 5 star for chitragupt's and yamraj's acting and remaining for the movie's plot.. A movie which goes on and on without any intention just to merge 4 seperate stories.. I think motive was to create dark comedy like delhi belly but couldn't even get near to that genre.. A seriously failed attempt in creating a movie for any kind of audience
437,"Waste of money in ways we don't even know
Think many times before you watch"
438,Just showing the propaganda against a particular community
439,"How to brainwash the young generation in the name of entertainment, and start despising/belittling their culture - is the intent of this so called dark comedy.Avoid it"
440,Bollywood never tires of attacking Hindus. This movie has gone one step further and attacked an eminent journalist as well. Either they copy paste from the South or Hollywood or come up with pathetic scripts like this one !
441,"No one has spoke out for their co star SSR justice , so , boycott movement going on"
442,No Idea About This Film Wahat Happened...Such a Bad Movie I hd Ever Seen..wrost Than Baaghi 3 And Race 3...
443,"Ludo, is like a badly cooked ""khichadi"". No storyline, no consistency in scripting. No two scenes are coherent. 'Naa koi sirr Naa koi paer."" Poor direction. Bad photography and weak editing. A utterly confused director tries to link his own life's philosophy with four different stories which are not coherent and irrelevant. One of the worst movies ever made."
444,"The worst part is the background track, it tries really hard to make things look funny, but fails miserably. There is not much of story. You just create some random stories and then somehow connect them"
445,In many scenes they have made sure to make fun of hindu gods and culture. To hurt sentiments of Hindus is something not acceptable. This looks a bigger agenda for people involved in making movies.
446,"Not sure about all those over the top reviews, but couldn't find anything extraordinary about the movie.
Making fun of cows,Hindu idols, Hindu Temple, jokes about Arnab's show and voice for narration is a gift,its not for everyone.
The way the stories are connected is quite impressive and individual performances from Pankaj Tripathi and Rajkumar Rao are amazing, rest others also did justice to their characters.
Watch it with low expectations on Sunday afternoon.
Cheers"
447,"Waste of time. Don't watch it, it's totally Hinduphobic, demeaning hindu gods."
448,"Such a shame that some people are behind this Bollywood!
They don't have respect to a co star like Sushant.
All are druggies.
Why people still want to waste time In Bolllywood I don't understand.
I have one agenda now Boycott Bollywood."
449,"Including nepotistic products will actually just offer bad acting, really crass performances. It's time Bullywood should refrain from casting nepotistic products, and start giving real talent a chance.
Such a badly made film & even worst performances by Abhishek Bachchan, Aditya Roy Kapur.
Nothing but disappointing. !!"
450,"The 3 stars are due to a star each for Rajkumar Rao, Pankaj Tripathi and the concept.
The director had a good story but took too much time..With many unneeded scenes and pacing.
A good screenplay and some sensible dialogues would have made it better.
There were many weak links in the direction and unnecessary dialogues which had absolutely no use but to mock.
Expected a lot better from Anurag Basu."
451,Ludo is an average movie with an average script.It's too long and definitely not in same league of dark comedy like Delhi Belly.
452,"The movie is very redundant in its selective criticism of our society's ills. While the message conveyed is OK, with a lot of space to add for creativity, the movie directors were burdemed with the same old tendency of virtue signalling via preaching inclusivity. Not done. Hope Anurag Basu does better and improves. Regret watching it, will recommend my friends to keep away"
453,Third class movie from a third classs director. Bad job
454,"Keept sleeping after every 10 mins.
Entire story is filled with plotholes, PJs and stereotypes."
455,Full of BS. No story line.bad direction. bad editing. This type of movie should be banned. OTT platefrom should be regulated from this BS movies.
456,"I watched after it went viralIt has a promising cast. The story is interesting in bits and pieces.If you are high and drunk, you can watch anything even this.If sober like i was, not a recommended watch."
457,"Lacks story , comedy was forced and in bad taste . If looking for entertainment, better to watch Korean cat videos"
458,This movie has is a joke in the name of art. you people make jokes on Hindu gods shame on you.
459,Please don't waste your time watching this sub standard production by people who have no creative or story telling ability. They were even unimaginative to come up with a good name
460,Great performance with excellent direction and dark comedy... entertaining and worth watching
461,"The movie has multiple plots and characters which are connected to each other. The characters are so well written. You'd fall in love with even the characters with very little screen time. And obviously the actors are great.. they've done justice to these characters. Would definitely recommend everyone to watch this movie! It's quite different and brings so much hope in the bollywood space! Although, the ending disappointed me."
462,"I think, I watched a great Hindi movie with a solid story line after sooo long which wasn't a copy of any other movie neither a biopic but a total original. From the screenplay to the scripts, everything is so great and on point. The humor of the movie and the comedy timing couldn't be any better. All the cast-members were so solid and excellent with their parts. Each and everyone, individually were just great.Four different life stories go on with these sets of people and each story ends with a beautiful message.Overall, just Loved the movie. Mr. Basu really did his best work and you can totally see that through the entire film.As a viewer and a Bollywood fan, I really enjoyed the whole movie a lot and couldn't be happier to see such a film after so long."
463,Hats off Basu .... once again u did it.Awesome ...xllnt.....Narration superb
464,Don't miss it must watch every one did a mindblowing work especially abhishek bachchan
465,"Reminds me of the old time hera pheri, type blunder. Cast is top notch and story hilariously well connected."
466,"Most entertaining flim I watch till date!!!(watched more than 150 good films till now)
-T-Series stand off clapping for uhh for your background music from start to endüòª
-what a majeedaar acting and awesome done by rajkumar and Pankaj Tripathi!
-SCREENPLAY is very fast and very engaging+entertaining!!üòäüëç
-Songs are also very relaxing and good!

467,"Well thought through chaotic plot, perfect combination of comedy and crime thriller."
468,Best movie absolute worth watching. This movie is Must watch
469,"Ludo is a mixture of brilliantly arranged 4 diff stories in the format of ludo game ! Anurag basu is a brilliant man ! The screenplay of this movie is very complex but yet we understand everything ! Cinematography is next level ! Story writing, character depth everything is just perfect ! Climax could have been more good , this is the only weakness in movie ! Music is on another level and is perfectly placed in movie ! Performances of all actors are up to the mark ! Anurag basu is a genius , the way he related all stories is just exceptional ! Overall this movie contains everything humour , emotion , a bit romance !! I personally loved rajkumar rao's character (funnily emotional) ! Overall ludo is a must watch film !"
470,One of the best movie i have ever watched. Every one was entertaining
471,Don't pay attention to low ratings...some people are still on mindless boycott spree and seems to have no taste in cinema whatsoever. The movie is absolutely great and leaves you warm and smiling. I enjoyed the subtle underlying philosophy in every story. All the actors did justice to their parts. It is arguably one of the best Indian movies I watched in 2020.
472,"There are Fewest movie in Bollywood, which has a perfect story with perfect starcast and this movie is one of them, this movie takes your attention from the starting. The Ending of the story is perfect, all credits goes to Mr. Anurag Basu. Perfectly connects all characters of the movie. Pankaj Tripathi, Rajkumar rao, Aditya Roy and Abhishek bachchan all actors done their work perfectly. This movie have, Drama, Comedy, Emotion. And most important a Great life message."
473,"It is absolutely anurag Basu thing.
No character in the movie is loose every single character has as its soul intact.
The timing of pankaj tripathi.
The amazing act of rajkumar Rao
The charming Aditya Roy Kapoor.
Actresses were great.
And the Abhishek bachchan at his very best less talk more towards acting.
This is a well made movie we must watch watch you will not regret watching."
474,One of the most impressive films of the year. Anurag basu has nailed it again.
475,A must watch entertainer. Black comedy at its best. All actors played their part so well. Very well directed by Anurag and music has also suited the situations.
476,It's a new form of entertainment well made by mr Basu he perfectly merged all 4 colours of ludo and ended by resting them in their respective life'sSuperb acting by Pankaj and RajkumarThe movie perfectly takes twists and turns like in ludo game with other aspects like emotions humour action background scores etcA little bit of editing is requiredYou have to prepare yourself for a new kind of entertainment in Bollywood
477,Finally a good (original) Bollywood movie after a long time with sone good soundtracks
478,"No need to watch any bullywood movie as they dont deserve this.
Wanted to give 0 but there was no option so giving 1 dont be much happy."
479,Worst movie seen. Please don't waste your precious time on this crap
480,Please don't waste your money or time to watch this movie. Completely pathetic movie plot.
481,Over acting and very bad story. Not interested. Story is boring. Bad location just boring.
482,Avoid this movie..yet another worst movie of 2020..
483,I wasn't expecting this good !! All the actors nailed their performances..esp pankaj sir and rajkumar rao. Even junior bacchan was good. The storyline and perspective of fulfilment of life was beautifully written and portrayed by the director !
484,"Another masterpiece of Anurag Basu... This is a fantastic movie... Fantastic story telling, direction & acting department is also superb... Pankaj Tripathi, Avishek Bachchan, Sanya Malhotra.. all r brilliant."
485,"Low class Bollywood product, cannot watch with family."
486,"This movie is total waste of time, its a hinduphobic movie which runs left propoganda, if u hate anti nationals then give this movie a miss"
487,"The movie is about four different stories that comes across each other at a given point of time just like the game Ludo. But here is the thing, all the stories as an individual had a point in it but they were brought together with each other with too many co incidents. I mean some times you feel like it's forcefully asked to cut each other's path which makes the plot boring and unreasonable. At certain places, it does make you laugh but you would know what happens next as the storyline progress which is where it becomes almost unbearable. It's not as great as I thought it would be after looking at some reviews. Not for me at least."
488,What the hell was this... wanna be Quentin Tarantino!!
489,It's full of chaos and madness...One disaster leads to another.
490,"Anurag Basu brings nothing new to the dark comedy genre. It will be a good watch for viewers who have no earlier experience in the genre. As usual Pritam delivers a soothing soundtrack for Basu's movie but except the Humdum song all others will,most probably, be lost in 4 months time at best. Among the actors Pankaj Tripathy, as usual, stands out with Ishtiyak Khan delivering a short but sweet performance.Fatima Sana Seikh is at her wooden best here with almost the same expressions carried over from ToH. Rajkumar Rao just sleepwalks through his role, Abhishek Bacchan, Aditya Roy Kapoor, Sanya Malhotra all does justice to their wafer thin characters. Overall, it is perhaps the best for Basu that this film wasn't released in the theaters."
491,"Anurag basu's LUDO is a deliciously dark comedy about 4 different stories that are 'colored' to represent various colors of the game Ludo.
While it does appear gimmicky at times, the resultant cinematography is exhilarating, to say the least. The movie is a masterpiece for those of us who relish the negative side of human nature, but care about the redeeming features in each of our protagonists.
The actors are top rate, from Aditya Roy Kapur, Sanya Malhotra, Abhishek Bacchan, Panjak Tripathi, Fatima Sana Shaikh & awesome support cast too. Rajkummar Rao is a revelation in his role as the love-struck break-dancing Anil - to say more would give away the extremely complex but smoothly interacting story lines. The characters are well admirably well sketched out, more creditable given their large number & complicated storyline.
The scale and the ambition of the Anurag Basu's movie is breath-taking. It has many twists and turns and remains spectacularly unpredictable and bursting with so many ideas that sometimes you wish that this was a web series instead of being just a movie. Unlike a conventional 4 stories tale that would slowly converge at the end, these stories keep on violently intersecting through out keeping us glued to the action. And did I mention the colors? Bright, vivid and dream-like, almost all scenes are shot in unique innovative cuts. This movie is one of those guilty pleasures that you would want to watch again. It reminds me of Kaminey (Dir Vishal Bhardwaj) and Ugly (Dir Anurag Kashyap) given the characters and their motivations.
The movie is full of unforgettable scenes and very detailed characterizations, the killing of the diamond trader is a pivotal moment and it is seen from the eyes of so many people. The dancing scene with the Mallu nurse & Mallu DJ scene is hilarious. I could go on, but it would make little sense until you have watched the movie yourself üòä!
This is not a movie for most people, though, the language, the violence and the non-linear narrative would be off-putting. The characters would appear to be acting randomly at times with little motivation beyond greed & anger most of the times.
Yes, the movie is filled with gore and gratuitous stylized violence. It is a little too long at 2h 30 min and some of the ideas don't work - the yamaraj and his crony appear in the start and then mostly at the end - without adding much except playing Ludo.
Given the frenetic pace of the movie, the climax appears to be not much more than what has been going on through the entire movie, but it does tie up a few things well.
This movie is going to become a cult classic dark comedy, one of the best from India. Thanks for giving us something enjoyable during these trying times Anurag Basu!"
492,"Love this movie, at some point you lough like mad...."
493,"If you're reading this review before watching ludo, I'll suggest you to watch the film.
Storyline of this movie is totally different.
Lot's of laughter, lessons and how life goes on is showed."
494,Watch it for Raj Kumar Rain and Pankaj Kapoor..world class acting..I have goosebumps..so happy to see Indian cinema making this type of movie..very gripping..and entertaining..and can't get over the song..beta g!!
495,"Don't know about others but this movie has reached my level of expectations, i loved how all stories got connected and everyone has done well. Songs were also good. A perfect film for OTT"
496,"Never got bored a minute
Keeps u into it till the end"
497,Whoever is reading this review before watching movie dont waste your time just go n watch.
498,Power packed performance of all actors...abhishek bachchan and pankaj tripathi is awesome as always.....rajkumar rao also gives great performance...
499,"Ludo - Anthology Dark Comedy Crime Movie
Cast - Abhishek Bachchan, Aditya Roy Kapur, Rajkummar Rao, Pankaj TripathiAfter really long days, such a fantastic heart touching thriller movie. This movie is packed with heavy dialogues from various characters. In this movie, four separate stories are narrated and convert into a marvelous single story just like a game of Ludo board. I loved everyone in this movie especially Abhishek and Pankaj was top-notch. The screening of this movie, the assembly of scenes together, and the flow of the story is beyond the standard of Anurag Basu.On the other hand, I could not find any drawback to this movie. I was so into the movie. There is a scene from Abhishek in the last part of this movie, which I think nailed the whole expectation. One serious dialogue example is mandatory, ""kam paisa me khush rehna difficult hai, leken ziada me impossible"". For being a comedy movie, it provided a deep sense of humor as well as some simple funny setup, I liked both. It is a movie that can be seen again and again just because it never gets boring. I have seen a really good movie after long days to which I can give ratings openly. This is a true masterpiece.Personal Rating - 9/10"
500,"The ""o beta ji"" Song became my favorite after watching this movie. üòÇ.. Best movie with best actors.. Everyone has done their job perfectly"
501,After a long break i saw one of best movie in 2020. Thinks a lot Anurag Basu making such kind of cinema üôèüíØüíØ
502,"After a long time, movie with good story line, direction and screenplay. No need to mention about cast and their roles especially pankaj and Rao"
503,"Stop your worthless propangandas..
Go fk urself !!
This is movie no less than a masterpiece!
Much credit to Basu sir!
Comgo to thw whole team."
504,"Humiliation for hindu religion bollywood always tries to humiliate hindu religion , initial dialogues are irritating"
505,"One of the most artful movie I have watched, involvement of philosophy and the way the different life's was involved like a web structure was so brilliant, depicted true nature of our life.
Great movie"
506,"I was going through a rough face in life. Then I saw Ludo, really it detoxfied me and brought a very positive energy. Guys Wath this movie, you won't regret it, in fact you to"
507,"Ludo started as complex drama , it takes few minutes to get involved in proceeding There are parallel track running and Cris crossing the path, it's dark it's real Anurag Basu direction is fun Pankaj Tripathi is brilliant Story involving newcomer is endearing Abhishek Bachchan and child artist track is cute Sanya Malhotra is dependable It's fun watch"
508,This is best rollercoaster with very impressive screenplay and very much fun.
509,Best movie full entertainment.all actors play their role perfectly.
510,Amazing Movie all must watch. The life of this movie is its script and characters. All actors did good justice to their roles. Keeps you engrossed till the end credits. Go watch it and enjot
511,Just amazing Abhishek rajkumar pankaj u all are just awesome aditya tooo
512,"Movie is made with already popular actor/actresses. so one can believe this would have been an easy shot, But you'll find every character has done a very different role play than you are used to watch them as earlier.Rajkumar Rao, Pankaj Tripathi, Aditya Roy Kapur, Sanya, Pearl, everyone gave their exemplary performances. all are seen 100% inside their uniquely drafted characters.Movie keeps you glued to screen with its turning corners,
Even though there are multiple parallel universes stories running throughout, you never feel a disconnect.Surprisingly great music.Very easily one of the top comedy movies of indian cinema made to date, definitely even higher on the list of recent ones.Great Ending,,,"
513,A dark comedy with smart storytelling. People with particular agenda are trying to downgrade this brilliant movie
514,"The actual rating is 8/10 (But as we always known that a good handwriting deserves extra points, this too deserves it!! to motivates directors like him & as well as others..Overall the movie is an excellent work from Indian Cinema. The opening of the movie & introduction was well placed. The 2 hrs 30 minutes fun was well deserved though you might loose your clutches in between the movie. To that, simply hold on!!It is well casted movie who have committed excellently to the characters. Pankaj Tripathi alias Sattu Bhaiya "" take a bow"".. ""Bittu"" too has played well in the narrative.Anurag Basu has delivered yet another wonderful piece in this new genre after ""Barfi"" & ""Jagga Jasoos"" in terms of cinematography & direction. Though the plot should be taken in taste of bollywood, we love chatpata!!The genre is not new to fans who loved ""Pulp Fiction"" - 1994. But to watch a spectacular narrative/direction in Indian Cinema was something new to watch after a long time."
515,"My review is too short but it says whole.That is
""Watchworthy,more than the most."""
516,If you want to experience different in way of film. Ludo is one of them in very different to present for all characters life which connect to end but only one disappoint is for story line make to long and this film borred in some points. Otherwise üëç
517,"A very good fictional movie by Anurag basu. A movie with very good direction,editing & acting. Loved watching it."
518,"After missing for long post Barfi success, he has again given a creative masterpiece."
519,"Best direct and performance from actors.
Wish there's more of this movie to watch üëÄüëÄ"
520,"Must watch movie I love the way potrey the story Ludo of life, Anurag sir badhai from Bhilai."
521,"I love the movie personally,specially the rajkumar Rao and Fatima Sana sheikh 's portion.it was quite interesting
Also,Rohit saraf was also a show stealer and Aditya Roy Kapur and pankaj tripathi was also fantastic.its a decent time pass watch"
522,"Finally, a great comedy drama movie from Bollywood. This is one of the well made and entertaining movies in Bollywood in last 5 years. Everyone did a fantastic job in acting. The making of the movie is also applaudable. Running four stories simultaneously and converging them together-- hats off, Anurag Basu."
523,"The way Anurag sir add some of really sick reality of our goverment in today's around, perfectly. And don't listen 1/10 review they are idiots. Awesome movie go for it."
524,"The analogy between life and the game of Ludo is astoundingly depicted in this movie. Anurag Basu's cinematography has always created an apotheosis in bollywood movies. Good cast, strong story line and humor makes it quite appealing. The movie does drag abit at some point and that's when the audience can lose an eye. To summarize, definitely worth watching this movie."
525,"Indian version of Guy Ritchie or Tarantino (without much blood shed) style movie.. Great writing, screenplay, cinematography in Indian Context..Tripathi and Rajkumar rao steal the show.. others are also top notch, especially the side kicks of main antagonist..And Anurag Basu in his role also surprising..Good entertainment all the way.."
526,"I wish I had more time to write a longer review, but I guess most of my limited free time this weekend has gone towards re-watching this movie. I know what clicked for me: the musical style, and the quirky style"
527,"After long time other than Bollywood typical drama, I watched diffrent type of movie, very good screenplay, Director tells a different type of story."
528,I dont usually review but its nice movie all actors played well screen play i slow its the type of movie you can watch it for fun in free time.i saw some people are saying its not good and making religious comments i would say experience it yourself.it is better than movie like goalmaal. I hope everyone like minded would like it
529,Hats off to Anurag Basu. This movie shows even chaos can be beautiful if rightly presented. From acting to direction each aspect of the movie was brilliantly executed. Loved it
530,Well enacted ! Cast puts on an amazing 2.5 hr show. Only critique would be to shorten the film by just 20 odd minutes.Overall the movie puts up a good show.
531,Brilliant movie acting story directing love did it deserve theatrical release mind blowing
532,"Just like Laxmii, this too is a great movie but it's a little on the dark humour side. Amazing cast and well written story."
533,"Yes,it's Anurag Basu's film , gud story-writing , screenplay ,direction n yes flawless acting of Abhishek,Pankaj n Rajkumar raoüëç"
534,"Awesome, must watch, I am now fan of anurag sir, seriously a moviu which Bollywood needs"
535,"Simply put, the best bollywood movie of 2020. Superb cast brilliant performance. You will experience all the emotions in this intertwined story telling."
536,"Good one.
Anurag Basu has rocked in this movie.4 sotries are inter connected to each other."
537,"After Serious Men this is most successful OTT by bollywood.
A fresh story with powerful characters and how their shades folds with the series of events is nicely done. Pankaj Tripathi nails it with his comic timing and Abhishek is just amazing with his emotions. Rajkumar Rao as usual is best. But Pankaj Tripathi has given a hell of a performance, I always say Pankaj Sir is more good with comic roles as compared to his masters in serious roles. His comic timing is bang on.The movies also has some very powerful visual comedy that makes you laugh and go rofl. On the other hand in most of the scenes Abhishek makes you feel the emotions of innocence, joy and pain without even saying a single word. And with all that the good music is icing on the cake. The perfect timing for background music is what other film makers should learn from this rather than forcefully injecting a full song with background dancers."
538,"Anurag basu sir direction is best..
Everyone's acting is best including Rajkumar rao and pankaj tripathi..
Storyline is very good and engaging as audience don't get bored with the movie..
Netflix has released a very good movie after a long time..."
539,"This movie is way too deep than it looks. Kudos to one of the legendary director living in India today. The narrator with the grey beard was Anurag Basu himself, played the god of death & interlinked the game with the concept of life that's the reason they were at the places where people were about to die.. He did a great job all-through. Also awesome work by Pankaj Tripathi & Raj Kumar Rao(one of the greatest at this moment). Even Junior Bachchan & Aditya Roy Kapoor did a pretty decent job.One thing I would add here that people are saying this movie as Hinduphobic. But the actual concept has been lost over the dumbness of the religion-minded audience. When one of the two narrators (Chitragupta) talking ask the other(Yamraj) what is the meaning of sin and virtue, Yamraj narrates a tale of duryodhan from mahabharat being the villain but still ending up in heaven. Then he asks chitragupta where he thinks the characters of Pankaj Tripathi and Abhishek Bachchan would end up? And chitragupta says Abhishek would go to heaven as he sacrificed himself for his family and Pankaj to hell as he ruined a lot of lives. But Yamraj laughs and says no Pankaj is not dying so soon as he still has purpose to be on earth.Hence you see pankaj tripathi in the end credit scene, the movie conveyed that just because you are evil or good that doesn't determines whether you'll die first or go to heaven or hell. The good soul can die early while the evil can still lurk around. It's all about our purpose here. And when that is over no one can prevent death.Good to see concept of Hindi cinema is changing towards better mastery than the mindless scripts & actions."
540,"The story is so fragile that plots vanished faster than the dreams in inception.Still its few characters like Pankaj Tripathi (Sattu) ,Rajkumar rao(Mithunda) kept the heat on and yea its a must watch movie with sattu bhaiya sealing every edge of plot skillfully."
541,What a amazing movie from start to end I was laughing all the characters was superb but pankaj tripathi and rajkumar rao is brilliant
542,Surprised to see the average rating of 7.6 !! This deserves a 9 star instead if not a complete 10.
543,"Very good direction,acting, screenplay, storytelling. Very good cinema to watch.must watch"
544,"All the stories are interesting
Acting is top-notchBut this type of movie could be hit or a flop due to Editing, and the editing is amazing and superb.Love every frame of this movie."
545,"Some amazing performances by Pankaj Tripathi ji and Rajkumar Rao ji. Although I felt a few pieces could have been better. Some parts could have been excluded, like I loved the connections but I felt there was too much love."
546,Worth watching. Keeps you engrossed throughout. Of course you need brains to connect with the story.
547,It's an entertainment film .. must watch because of Pankaj Tripathi ...Fantastic Acting boss.
548,Almost all points wat makes a movie to be watchable is der in this movie. Real things r well reflected on reel platform. It deserves a watch who really respect the meaning of life.
549,"Much watch movie
All cast acting is very well
Comedy, dialogue, screenplay, direction all are very good"
550,"After watching many same storylines movie this time anurag basu did something different and it is an experimental and result is awesome. I have seen many movie since last 1 year where i have to skip some nonsence part but in this movie not a single minute i got bored and haven't skipped a 10 second. The story of 4 different people has shown amazing and pankaj Tripathi as it is ""lit""
Abhishek tried his best in this movie and rajkumar rao has given his best as expected.
Inshort amazing.."
551,"Each and every character has done well.... everyone is awesome. Specifically for the first time I felll in love with Aditya Roy Kapoor. I felt that he needs good director. For God sake Aditya choose good characters who can can make you act. You are handsome but you need good cultivator. As usual and as expected Raj Kumar Rao, Pankaj Tripathi remains the best...the best. Sanya Malohtra, sana Shaikh, Abhishek Bachchan, Rohit suresh, Pearley Maaney,Shalini vatsa is also amazing...just liked it Mr. Basu - yamraj ji"
552,"In Ludo, he creates a mash-up of stories, sensibilities, tonalities. He returns to the multiple-story format, which he had used in his 2007 film Life in a...Metro. Using the game of Ludo as metaphor and structural skeleton, Anurag, who also wrote the film, constructs four interlocking stories. The twists in one impact the other. There is so much going on that Anurag himself appears as sutradhar, delivering exposition, explanation and also spelling out the big themes the film is grappling with - notions of good and evil, crime and punishment, love, death, murder, sacrifice. All of which is done with a mood of dry self-awareness, outlandish humor and eye-popping colour - incidentally Anurag is also the DoP."
553,"Ludo is a very welcome movie in diwali season especially after the massive disappointment that laxmii was. It's a well written movie with great acting all actors were amazing but male leads did a tremendous job especially Abhishek,rajkumar rao (Dance moves to die for), Pankaj and Aditya. There is some satire related to Hinduism in movie for comedic effect it may offend some people (didn't offend me) but nothing major. It's not a masterpiece but it's entertaining and guaranteed to get some good laughs out of you."
554,"Undoubtedly the best comedy movie of this year. So many characters and so many stories, still managed to make this fun and enjoyable. There was not even a single moment where the comedy was forced and this is the best part of this movie. Each and every song was worthy of watching. It's a 2.5 hrs full of joy kind of movie. It's also unusual to find a great message out of a comedy movie these days and it delivers that with brilliance!"
555,Simply an amazing story with interconnected character plots. Loved the direction and all the performances from a stellar cast. Kudos to Anurag Basu and Netflix for producing the film
556,"This Movie is very interesting.
Best movie for comedy lovers.."
557,"This is boring movie, dont watch on gun point, all is overacting and script is weak"
558,Worst acting and senseless script. Fully boycott this nonsense. The actors need some basic acting classes :-)
559,"Stupid movie, lacks performance . Plot is confusing. Waste of time"
560,"Idiot Director has done nothing except promoting his leftist propaganda and defaming Hindu Gods and GoddessesNo story
NothingFirst 20 minutes were so horrible that I thought Film making is the easiest task."
561,"Movie Total is fine with Mila but some scenes have anti Hindi agenda like she Ram Leela Wala, Abhishek Bachchan was kidnapping Behrupio in the car, do we find such girls before marriage that are for the experience Dating is absolutely a stupid concept, do all husbands have an affair after marriage, Bikul Chutiyapa has a communist agenda, I will give 3 stars for only acting
Has the whole of India been like this?
These OT platforms should be censored!"
562,Anurag tried his best to pull out a different storyline . In patches film is ok but lacks engaged screenwriting. You can give it a try and you may or may not like it depends .
563,"WELL ONE THING I WANT TO ASK ANURAG BASU THAT WHAT HE THINKS WHILE MAKING HIS MOVIES. SERIOUSLY ONE SENTENCE, FANTASTIC JOYRIDE OF ROLLER COASTER FILLED WITH FUN, HUMOR COMEDY, EMOTION AND DRAMA. IT MADE ME REJUVENATE. THIS IS THE BEST MAINSTREAM BOLLYWOOD FILM OF THE YEAR."
564,"This guy deserve a Oscar, Your heart will open after his movie. What a movie üé•"
565,Amazing performance by all actors and great direction by Anurag Basu. It deserved to be released in theaters but never a less a great treat for Netflix lovers.
566,"A must watch movie. If u feel depressed just watch this movie.
Positive points :
Pankaj Tripathy just nailed it.
Raj kumar Rao amazed again with his extra ordinary skills.
Malayalam actress was bang on.
And the climax
On the top Anurag Basu's direction."
567,Money and time waste to watch these flop actors. Need to see some new faces
568,Great movie everything is perfect and connected well.
569,"Nothing, just nothing can make bollywood work now. Justice for ssr."
570,"Is this blood money tainted as well?
Another suicide squad hit job ?Seriously you've tainted an entire creative craft and turned it into a tool for Organized Crime"
571,"Unnecessarily target Arnab goswami and Hinduism, spread hinduphobia"
572,No value for money!! Not worth spending time and money
573,"We are done with bullywood.... waste of time and money... copied stories, overacting & weak storyline"
574,"It's boring.
Though star cast is good but it's boring and text book jokes and plots."
575,Filthiest anti hindu content which openly disrespects hindu god and mocks them.its time to take such directors and producers to court.
576,Zeroes of charsi world zeroes of charsi world losers of charsi world
577,"Bakwas movie, avoid wasting time. Better spend your time with more watchable movies worth your time."
578,"Starts really well but becomes clustered eventually. Nonetheless, the movie is watchable. Performances, camerawork, few characters, background score, screenplay and direction are good.Too many character arcs, length/editing are minus."
579,"Although there are a few things that I still need to process and analyze with the film (probably after another watch) Ludo is definitely one of the years most inventive films from Bollywood. It talks about sin, virtue, karma and a lot of other things and is beautifully choreographed as a multi linear anthology Black Comedy. It definitely has ""Pulp Fiction"" ""Super Deluxe"" and ""In Bruges"" Vibes and is a performance heavy film. The actors are just incredible in their respective characters and are perfectly cast. My only grievance with the film is that at the end of the film, Bittu (Abhishek Bachchan) gets killed as I felt that for the character, more than death it should have been love that would have been the perfect redemption for him. Rest, I am completely happy with the film. Maybe a few more viewings would throw some more light on the plot."
580,"Just loved it,all 4 stories were really HEARTOUCHING, It was really fun to watch.loved it!!"
581,"Movie was really nice yaar, it's a must watch for 2020
JUST EPICCC!"
582,Best movie. Do watch it . I assure you will not regret after watching it. Paisa wasool of Netflix subscription
583,LUDO is brilliantly written and the casting is just perfect. Right from the beginning it is fun ride full of comedy and tragedy. A good and must watch movie.Just don't miss out this one.
584,"The way four stories have been crossed over with each other is a fine example of how good Anurag is, a must watch!!"
585,"After lootcase, this film was the epic. Beautiful plot and script. Super acting by each character. But the little girl was away impressive and memorable.Anurag basu ur a GEM director"
586,"Acting of rajkumar, Tripathi and Abhishek is too good .. and all actors are also very good . But script not at it's best. But of hinduphobic content which I didn't like, but it's all u can expect from Anurag Basu. Rest one time watch is good not a family film"
587,"This is we are waiting for, it is released in the season of Diwali and its a ultimate blockbuster. The movie is so well crafted you will unable to predict what is going to be happen and when it does it makes you to smile on it.This is a beautiful film, everybody is great in this movie but the man of the match is RAJKUMAR RAO Sir. He is more than amazing, more than extraordinary, he is just mindblowing actor. Don't get the low rating so serious it is must watch movie."
588,"Anurag Basu is one of the few directors who have kept my faith in bollywood alive. I admire all his previous movies (barfi, life in a metro, murder, gangster) especially the way he explores the romance genre and integrates it with the rollercoaster of life. Coming back to Ludo, it's hands down one of the best movies of 2020 with 10/10 for its starcast, direction, screenplay and music. I really felt bad that I couldn't watch this in a theater as it is a full paisa wasool movie which both entertains and teaches you in a humorous way.. something quite rare in bollywood.Go watch it now and live with these amazing characters coming out of the box of genius filmmaker Anurag Basu. Thanks a lot for this movie sir..Hats Offüôèüôèüî•üî•"
589,"Excellent excellent & excellent must watch. Gr8 Story, good; outstanding"
590,Just wow! Didn't see this coming. Police guy and the Kerala girl was amazing.
591,"After long long time I watched such amazing movie.
Anurag, Abhishek Bacchan, Rajkumar, Pankaj, Aditya, Rohit, Geeta, Babita, ASHA, Praele kya must expression and acting the wow.
You all guys are great. Currently I am 24 old or Ludo aisa movie h jab m 60 Ka ho jaaunga tab bhi dekhna Pasand karunga."
592,"Pros :Excellent Cast! Just mind boggling to realize that such a BIG commendable cast could come togather for a EPIC MOVIE.WHAT PERFORMANCES, not gonna name any one, but from the BIG known ones to even the Cameo guys! Just ONE WORD - "" OUTSTANDING""Flawless execution of the script! The actors take You on a wild wild journey that's SO pleasant for every ones point of view.Engaging, NOT for a second You'd want to take Your eyes off the screen! Movie just engrosses you.Background score! WOW!CONS :MISSED IT ON THE BIG SCREEN üò≠VERDICT :GRAB SOMETHING TO EAT! SIT DOWN WITH FRIENDS OR ALL ALONE! JUST HAVE A GREAT TIME WATCHING THIS MASTERPIECE UNRAVEL."
593,"You will just love Pankaj Tripathi's act. Story is a blend, too funnt, awesome old track in background. Just watch it till end if you live twists. Its a pack of surprises. -1 star only fr unnecessary songs."
594,"After watch this movie...love it
Change the life
Change your thinking"
595,This will probably be the best movie of 2020. Each character does justice to their roles. Brilliant story telling specially those little moments where one story overlaps with the other. Lot of surprises throughout. Loved it.
596,"An ordinary story, an extraordinary narration. Keeps you entertained from the very beginning to the end. The game never gets bored!!!"
597,Great fun..good comedy..enough action and perfect thriller..
598,"Best movie of 2020...Yes I mean its a complete package ..Guess what u demand anything ...LUDO won't disappoint u..Sensational acting by all the actor/actress...You will love to watch drama,starting,climax inaddition lovely song which u can't skip at all..Good creative direction with a moral lesson at the end of the movie..Simply It should be nominated to Oscar award...This movie won't let you even wink eyes."
599,Nice direction everything was good but a little bit more humur could enhance the movie very much.
600,"The whole movie is fun
Thier are so many scenes which will make you laugh.
Its been a good 150 minutes for me.
Everyone should watch this one."
601,"What a movie! A must watch. Best of 2020. Anurag Basu has done it again. I was so frustrated with much hyped Laxmi, but equally impressed about this movie. Four different stories cross each other by extraordinary chain of events. Pankaj Tripathi is hilarious, outstanding as usual. I have now become fan of him. Rajkumar Rao, Aditya Kapur, Abhishek Bacchan have done descent job. Few small characters also made their presence felt. But real hero (or heroine) of the movie is Storyline. It makes you laugh, cry and remain hooked to your seat (or bed!). At least two songs are really very soothing (my personal favourite is Arijit Singh's ""Aabad Barbaad"". Worth watching over Diwali weekend. But due to its adult content (though very few) is not suitable for all in the family, it's so unfortunate. 8/10 from me."
602,"Fantastic Funny Fabulous Entertaining Enjoyable
Great cast and excellent performance by each and every cast member. Loved Ludo! A MUST WATCH"
603,Casting is very good. All the actors did equally good in their acting. 1 extra star for Abhishek Bachchan. I literally cried when Bittu meets her own daughter. What I can say about Pankaj Tripathi. He is always awesome. To say precisely everyone is good. Must watch cinema.
604,It's my first time review and i want to say this movie is a must-watch during quarantine times. Please watch if you feel bored! I recommend this movie but bring your own ludo board with you! I played this game since i was in vacation and i play it with my cousins! Hats off to the director! üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
605,"A good mess. Four different stories play in parallel which makes it a bit messy. But the stories individually are unique and fun-to-watch. Actors played their characters really well. Be it Rajkumar or Abhishek or Aditya roy kapur, everyone did justice to their parts. Pankaj Tripathi was the icing on cake.
P. s. Whoever says Abhishek Bachchan is bad in acting, go and see him.."
606,"Perfect orchestra of stories merging together with thought provoking questions about morality and circumstances.
Fast paced action comedy and class scattered throughout in healthy proportions.
Casting of actors was bang on.
And extra tip of the hat to the people who noticed Geeta and Babita Phogat's casting."
607,"When you lose hope from Bollywood, this one comes as a savior."
608,A brilliant multiplot storyline with Guy Rtichie like ending. I hope the the nepotism supporter crowd will ble able truly appreciate this great movie. It should go down the history line as one of the finest attempt in the genre of the dark comedy in bollywood.
609,"""Ludo"" is Anurag Basu's dreamy cinematography. It is Pritam's impeccably music. It is Anurag's ability to perfectly shatter our preconceptions at every single turn as we realize that there is nothing such as main character in this movie. All character have been given enough screentime to showcase their talent. We often talk about how good films would be worse-off if some part of it were in any way different. In the case of ""Ludo"" you flat-out can't imagine how it would even exist if these things were changed. When so many hot take thinkpieces try to explain away every ending or take a hammer to delicate illusions, it was a pleasure to try and understand how a movie like this one operates on all fronts to maintain an ongoing sense of mystique. Icing on the cake is the cinematography of the movie, its a young an upcoming talent ""Rajesh Shukla"" who has brought something new, creative, colorful visual delight for the Audience.Overall this movie has surpassed all the expectation of Audience. Kudos to Ludo's team, keep up the excellent work!!!"
610,Everyone is awesome but Pankaj Tripathi stole the show like anything. He's amazing. Love him.
611,Best movie 10/10 would recommend something different story keeps you watching everyone rocked the acting
612,"Firstly let me tell you this is something new and fresh rather than remakes, and story music and acting is top notch, direction and cinematography is also outstanding and at the same time Arijit Singh voice and BGM will melt your heart.
Don't miss at any cost it has everything comedy, emotion, and some brilliant performances."
613,"You expect to see a movie with dark humour, but end up questioning what's good and what's evil? Does nature or fate really reward the good, the oppressed, is the world really in favour of the underdog? This movie is a rare gem. Very original and fresh. Although it has four different streams connected by the dice ""Sattu Bhaiya"" it's closely connected and you never feel out of breath. Beautiful cinematography. Must watch. Best bollywood movie of 2020."
614,"It was lazy afternoon post Diwali and we were browsing through Netflix. And this movie kept us glued to screen, with well intersecting story and amazing performance by Pankaj Tripathi, rajkumar Rao and little girl."
615,"Who said everything in 2020 is wrong?
One of the finest movie in terms of writing story.
Every single scene is excellently written. Emotions, comedy, adult, acting, content, etc. Full package in 1 movie. Love you #AnuragBasuSir"
616,"After long time watched a complete engaged film, full of entertainment, loved it"
617,"Just go and watch, it's just wow. all are doing best,"
618,"Anurag Basu has yet again proved that he is a true artist. The movie is a beautiful work of art with a sweet story, beautiful bgm and a superb cast. Every character has a well balanced role in the plot with superb performance by all the actors.
Go give it a watch."
619,"Full of drama, humour, sense and entertainment...a great watch."
620,"I watched this Ludo for the Pankaj and Rajkumar but when I completed it, I remained stunned with acting of whole crew members.
Great effort by Basu."
621,Yesterday I saw the film and planned to give it 8/10 and that's because of the length but I'm giving it 10 just cause I saw people asking to rate it down on twitter.The movie is totally worth your time and really funny with a satisfactory ending. The length could have been less but overall it's good.Ignore these 1 star reviews as they were asked by Gems of Bollywood twitter account cause according to him the movie is hinduphobic which is not true and you can watch it and judge for yourself
622,Need to respect the director and producers to come into new segment and make such great movie!A must must watch!
623,Waoo this movie is amazing and above my expectations
624,"Ludo, the film having multiple stories, 5 to be more on front role, inter twisted with each other right from the beginning till the end, looks like a perfectly written screenplay. Moreover it's a entertaining with all kinds of emotions and pulling leg of some ongoing issues, it doesn't fail to make you laugh till the end."
625,"Everything is there u want from a movie , it is a fantastic, fabulous and all the quality u can add to it , u can't able to know where the movie will take u , Great cast , director and writer . All the things are just awesome btw Pankaj sir is immortal no doubt .."
626,Anurag Basu has nailed to perfection in connecting all the 4 plots. All 4 stories have their ups and downs but one thing in common : hell lot of dark comedy. Pankaj Tripathi and Rajkumar with effortless comedy are a treat. Definitely a must watch in 2020 .
627,Excellent entertainment.. it's a perfect anthology and all the actors have fresh roles with different moods but a tinge of sad humour everywhere.
628,"The only good thing about this movie is that it had decent suspense and humour and acting was good enough.
Though it's not unique as many movies like this have been made earlier, showing 3-4 guys and their stories and how their stories cross meet in between. They just added the ludo game concept in their stories to make it look different."
629,"I didn't expect to like it. But it's an amazing movie. The star cast is obviously talented. Abhishek Bachchan is really good. Plot is good, direction is amazing. Must watch"
630,Movie deserve 7 stars but 3 extra stars for Rajkumar Rao and Pankaj Tripathi they totally stole the show with amazing acting
631,"Definitely one of the most amazing Bollywood Movies!!!The mind-blowing script, acting and everything. It is miraculous how four different stories are connected to each other and life interpreted as a game of Ludo!!!The movie has all the elements comedy, drama, romance, crime, tragedy, thriller. A must watch for all!!!Anurag Basu is so great!"
632,Bollywood copy paste type story as usual.Movie have Propegenda to praise crime hence can be promote it
633,"I just wish this was not such a lengthy movie. But I suppose that was needed to justify each story and then bring all the stories together.
Every actor has done their part well! A truly entertaining movie! Watch it!"
634,"Beyond words...
Watched two times in a day
Lot to learn about sin and virtue.."
635,"A product of brilliant direction, amazing cinematography - screenplay and phenomenal performances. It's good to see that some directors like Anurag basu are still trying to push the envelope with their content and ideas."
636,"Yet another Anurag Basu masterpiece. The Anurag Basu's way of story telling is the best. Awesome Direction,cinematography and screenplay, what esle we from a movie."
637,"LUDO
Hilarious!!!
Must watch!!!! Don't miss the perfect direction and spectacular acting.
Congratulations to the film and everyone who made it possible,
Abhishek, Raj Kumar Rao, Pankaj Tripathy, and all the actors are outstanding.
Joy Sengupta(Executive Producer)‚ù§‚ù§ such a proud moment seeing her name in credits."
638,Thanks Anurag sir for this diwali gift. This is a true cinema with vivid characters plotted on the game of Ludo. Everyone have given best performance. Must watch movie.
639,"Really a great movie. After a long time watched an amazing movie in hindi. First Netflix original hindi movie which liked this much. Worthy watched, whole movie was entertaining."
640,"First lootcase and now this masterpiece! What an amazing story, such amazing performances and top notch direction. Didn't get disconnected even once. Anurag Basu is hands down one of the most innovative directors India has. The story was so well knitted, it almost had a Tarantino-esque feel to it entirely, still so unique! Pankaj Tripathi is just mind blowing. And so many talented actors like Rohit Saraf, Pearle Maaney, Rajkumar, Sanya, Fatima, Aditya, what a freaking amazing cast. Loved everything about the film. We need more films like these, with amazing ensemble like this and an amazing story + direction!"
641,Great casting by the dictator. All actors performance was brilliant specially Aditya Roy Kapoor and Rajkummar Rao. Some questions remain unanswered. Which is a little bad for my point of view.But it's one of the best movie of 2020 no doubt.
642,Really after a long time....finally a good movie with awsome storyline....just a small issue story has a fast pace story should really need time to buildup cherecter devlopment..I think if it would be a series... I mean short series with 4_5 episode some extra one hour time to have cherecter devlopment...it would be a really fire in bollywood... performance was really awsome all cherecters was pretty good in their cherecters..i think we need more series/movie like this
643,"Bollywood masala movie but, filled with the super performances of renowned actors. After watching Abhishek's acting, I realized how other directors misused/couldn't discover his talent.After watching a movie, one should feel like the time/money well spent and I did feel so."
644,"LUDO is by far one of the best movie script written in recent times. Hats off to the writers.The movie kept the LUDO game theme in the entire length, and even the car number plate has LUDO written in it. Usually, different stories tend to be more complicated, but Anurag Basu has kept it more straightforward and yet engaging in his direction.
I loved his cameo in the movie to narrate the story and reveal nothing more to the audience, making it intriguing.The role of Rahul Satyendra ""Sattu"" Tripathi seems to be written only for the Pankaj Tripathi, and as usual, he nailed it completely. Abhishek Bacchan, known as ""Bittu"", has kept his familiar angry face and was right on the money to justify his role in the movie.Overall a great movie to watch, and the movie will keep you engaging through it."
645,There is chaos .. there is no logic .. but there is magic in this movie .. loved the whole movie every clip .. each story the director has made us fall in love with the characters
646,"Perfectly crafted crew members, awesome direction and plot. Analogy of ludo, heaven/hell, that was dope & deep."
647,"Time and again, bollywood treats it's audience like third graders. At least, anurag Basu and gang did not make that folly. I would not be really surprised that in the times to come, the script of this movie would be linked to some other international project and we cry plagiarism. Now, that's a compliment if this is original. I enjoyed the ride and a special shout out to Raj Kumar Rao, Pankaj Tripathi and Abhishek Bachchan. They were awesome and so was the ensemble cast. The stand up comedian Sudeep was aslo seen here and I wished he got a bit more screen time. The movie in itself grasps your attention right from the opening scene. It's definitely worth a watch. Many twists and turns that add up to the gritty writing and holding the genuine script with an awesome casting choice. A Malayali nurse and a goon, or a Malayali nurse and a man caught in the midst of mayhem( both sets being different pair of characters mind you), all the while when the main compatriots are trying to hoodwink each other was an awesome watch. I just hope that more such movies are made now and then. My final say is that movie makers need to really learn from the trailer of this film. It kept enough interest in the movie without revealing too much of the plot. I liked it and I recommend this for all average to above average brainers. Those who love leaving the brains at home for a masala flick are advised to steer clear."
648,"You don't want this movie to get end.Emotions,comedy everything was perfectly blended.pankaj Tripathi OMG another level.Rajkumar Rao take a Bow.Even other actors were fine.Must watch"
649,This movie is so much fun and wonderfully told. The way Anuraj has meshed all the stories together is fantastic! (Almost Guy Ricthie like! lol)Its a must watch when compared to the garbage that is coming out of Bollywood lately. This movie deserves a big screen release! Good job and please watch this one!
650,Every thing ott platform made this year was utter nonsense... But this movie is Anurag Basu genre .. I haven't seen better editor than Anurag Basu in bollywood... Apart from raj kumar Hirani ofcourse... Though you know what going to happen but while watching it u will only think of what's happening at present... This will happen no matter even if you watching 2nd time ... It's not easy concept to mix all characters in 2 hours yet to make them all important... Some times character makes you angry by their stupidity which only happens when writers and directors are not adequate ... But here it's all good ... All performed nicely... Difficult movie made easily.... Netflix give anurag basu good budget for next movie ... He deserves a lot more ...
651,"This film has portrayed the dark truth of life in a hilarious way... This movie is a gem.. Presentation,story and plot is so strong that it is an oscar nominee!"
652,What ana amazing movie it is. Really loved the screenplay as well as every character into the movie. I find the movie to be out of the box. Something which combines you to the real world. Proper interpretation of the misconception of heaven and hell.<3
653,Though the movie revolves around four groups of people but the way the writer connects it is so so so good. All the characters feel so real.üòç
654,"One of the best dark comedy film since Super Deluxe. It's so properly structured (script-wise) and the mythological allusions give it a make-believe feel. Anurag Basu is hands-down a genius in the way he's made all the actors act so well. Abhishek was so amazing and so were the rest of the cast. Your heart goes out to all the characters in film, especially Aditya and Rajkumar's characters and needless to say one can't stop themselves ever from simping over Pankaj Tripathi."
655,"Who says that bollywood doesn't make original movies!! Watch this and then decide for yourself. This is one of the best movies ever made by bollywood..Kudos to the entire team and the director, the magician, the story teller Anurag Basu.. Basu da you deserve every applause for making a cult classic like this.."
656,"This movie is food for Soul, there are moments where you get a lump in your throat. Loved it to the core"
657,"Liked the ensemble, acting and story....Netflix hindi movies content improving in last 2-3 months......after some really crappy movies till mid 2020...."
658,Excellent movie. Nice presentation. Great acting.its a must watch movie
659,"A well knitted tragedy drama flick you can't miss! And to enjoy full fun of the movie, don't miss a single scene (except part of ABs story). It's a bold one, not much of abusing words, but not a family-get-together watch."
660,"Watch for impeccable performance by every single actor. Abhishek does wonders with his rough but very emotional charater. Rajkumar Rao is pure delight to watch. Pankaj Tripathi as always, so easly steals the show. And this time Aditya Roy Kapoor sparkles."
661,Well Abhishek Bachchan is being always teased for his acting although I do like his acting in this movie somewhat and Breathe into the shadows was too good. And other cast were too good although some what less cast could be a preferable option üòÉ
662,Its been a while I have watched such an entertaining movie. All the actors have done a wonderful job. N the songs..mindblowing..loved it totally.
663,This is really awesome. All characters worked well with perfect timing.
664,"Excellent movie.. all stars acting is superb.. rajkumar rav,abhishek,pankaj tripathi did fantastic job..4 stories in this movie and all stories is very good"
665,"This movie is am damn sure is way ahead of time ... not everyone can understand this movie but it's quite impressive and awesome ... it's similar to "" AADU"" movie of Malayalam which was ahead of time and it got flopped because minute brains of people can't understand it ... A MUST MUST WATCH MOVIE"
666,"Well, idk what the critics have with this film but I liked the movie to the core. This is a movie that keeps you hooked with it's wacky yet endearing characters, fast moving plot, out of the world acting rather chemistry, and we'll woven story.Credit goes to the screenplay which is so good that even there is happening a lot of things you keep rooting for each and every character present, even for the crime boss Pankaj Tripathi who is in his top form!Every actor has done their part, from Rajkumar Rao to Paritosh Tripathi who plays an interestingly infuriating character. Also Abhishek Bacchan in his moments is just heart warming."
667,"Hats off too Anurag basu for a great film. It has a great story with excellent screenplay which keeps you hooked. The performances of the entire cast is brilliant. And the direction is simply outstanding. This film has humor, action, romance everything. Definitely a must watch."
668,"Do watch for unique story and superb acting skills.
Pankaj sir outshines everyone."
669,"India needs this type of content , beautifully shot , dialogue's , connection, comic, & acting."
670,"Awesome movie.. well written Story and script, very good direction ... Amazing performance by everyone.. surprised by Abhishek's performance.. One of his best..Pankaj and Rajkumar as usual outstanding... All actresses were good.. Standout performance was definitely by little girl.."
671,"First of all Superb Cast, Superb Acting and Superb Comic timing."
672,"The best part about this movie is all four parts are well narrated, even though the movie is about150 minutes long, you never get bored even for a second! Every character has sufficient time to make an impact. Music is so different and soothing plus performances of all especially by Rajkumar Rao, Fatima Sana Shaikh, Pankaj Tripathi, Rohit Saraf are excellent ! Please do watch it..."
673,"Great story, good acting by the lead actors.. especially Pankaj Tripathi.."
674,After a long time i saw a bollywood movie which is really awesome!
675,"It's a nice movie, it's really good. Pankaj Tripathi, Rajkumar Rao, Aditya Roy Kapoor, and all actors have done a great job. The screenplay is very interesting, Storytelling is great, and the ending is perfect too...Life is Just Like a Game of Ludo!"
676,"Plot:
Movie plot is similar has What in Ludo Game Happens,When 4 Different Living Famaily are Doing their Lifetime Routine , their Interfercence Caused One another
life Bending and its based on their Luck and Own Choice. But At Last their All this Combanitation Decides Thier DestinationActing:
Acting Skills and thier Performance of All characters is Great"
677,"Don't get confused as movie is linked to each character . When u start watching it will be more interesting.I wish I could give 10 stars but m giving only 9 coz I felt movie was enlarged a bit.
Overall a good entertaining movie"
678,"Just as there are red, green, blue, and yellow pieces in the game of Ludo, the events that take place in the life of the four main characters in the Ludo film represent these four colors, whose every move determines the dice of luck.These four characters are completely different from each other, but playing the game of life, luck brings them to the same 'house' (floor) again and again. Like the game of Ludo, there are such stops where they bite each other.A leaked sex tape, from a suitcase full of money to two painful murders; Four absolutely random stories collide with each other because of luck, coincidence, and a cynical criminal. Life has been compared to chessboard several times, but these four stories derived from the four colors of Ludo are interesting.All four stories are quite interesting. But the factor that pulls the film back is its length. This two and a half-hour film is boiled on several occasions.The different environments of the four stories and their characters are depicted in a great way. Editing done by Ajay Sharma could have cut a few more minutes. This game of Ludo is two and a half hours long. A tight screenplay could have proved even more effective. The dialogues written by Samrat Chakraborty are excellent in some scenes, while in some scenes listen and average."
679,"Best dark comedy movie ever seen. Stream it in my opinion. All the talented actors are there.
Little bit lack of comedy. You wont be laughing all the time."
680,"Full marks for direction, cinematography and editing.
The soundtrack is 'Meh', doesn't leave an impact except for the 'O Babuji' song. The film is quirky and weirdly random but thoroughly enjoyable for the most part.
Performances are top notch and yes - Aditya Roy Kapoor can act. Watch him in this film.
Anurag Basu's passion for cinema is very evident in this painstakingly crafted and beautifully shot film."
681,"One of those films which should have had a theatrical release. Anurag basu is a brilliant director and that can be visible on how he beautifully connects all storeies together.
Stand out peformance by abhishek bachchan, rajkumar rao and pankaj tripathi.
Aditya roy kapoor and sanya malhotara shares a breezy chemistry.
Definitely worth watch specially for its direction and performances"
682,"If you are a Guy Ritchie Fan no need to watch it.
if you don't like to watch copies/ inspired stuff no need to watch it.
If you are a fan of Rajkumar Rao then MUST watch it.
He stands out in a never before role and a pretty good adaptation for an Indian movie. The movie sets out as a dark comedy and does pretty well and the individual stories are well written too.
The music is slightly underwhelming but in the lockdown scenario you dont have much to do so might as well watch it."
683,It was such a big disappointment watching Anurag last film(Choked). This one has overcome that trauma :) This movie has all elements needed in a good movie and a very good star cast.
684,"This has to be the best thing of 2020 by miles
a topsy turvy joyful emotional ride. Rajkumar was the showstopper . Kya performnc dia..
abhsk bchchn finaly learning to act
mast mast movie"
685,"A great philosophical dark comedy with a little spice of thriller. After a a long time in bollywood, a praiseworthy movie is released. Every actors and actresses nailed it in their respective characters. Especially, the comic timings of Rajkumar Rao and the emotional expressions of Abhishek Bacchan will take your breath away. When Rajkumar Rao said ""Jan ke bhi barbad hone ka nam ishq hain"", it literally appeared on his face.
Writing was very beautiful and entertaining. And the dialogues were real class and mass . After ""Qarib Qarib Single Single"", this movie has impressed me with its witty and impactful dialogues.
If you want pure entertainment, good acting and decent storyline ; go watch this movie.."
686,"Great story and over the mark performances by entire cast. Heads off to Anurag Basu.Only you guys shouldn't have copied the bella ciao tune for the background music. Especially when the songs are so great.
#stopcopyingbollywood"
687,"The screenplay, dialog,direction and production makes the relationships between different characters look so awesome amidst chaos.
Bittu and the girl's story tops the scenes . Although the story has gaps but the fun in each characters reminds me Priyadarshan's movies."
688,Dark and funny comedy by each cast... Raj kumar Rao and Abhishek done good job..!!
689,Very good movie. Very well written and all the stories connected very well.
690,"Good Movie Must Watch, Rajkumar Rao and Pankaj Tripathi were awesome, Aditya and Abhishek (even getting a satisfying role) as usual can do better. Other characters are okay. Some situations of life is mentioned here which can be motivational. Overall a good product by NF besides a lot of flops from D+ Hotstar in bollywood."
691,Excellent portrayal of characters by the actors. An engaging movie with dark humour.
692,"Superb direction of an average to above average script. Actors and supporting cast have done a good job, atleast they seem to have worked pretty hard.Good to see how everything was managed almost perfectly in all the randomness of big pile of events.Entertaining, for sure!!
Good job, keep up the good work."
693,A rare gems of Bollywood touching upon all the genres. Great plot and well supported by all the actors. Arguably the best Bollywood movie of 2020. Hats off to Mr Basu for providing us with such a entertaining and enjoyable movie in such a difficult time.
694,"9 out of ten
This kind of moive is considered as bollywoodüíñüíñ"
695,"4 stories, each having their own perspective of right and wrong which eventually collides together to unravel the mysteries and how each are interconnected.
An excellent screenplay and fabulous direction by Anurag Basu which will keep audience in their toes with also lot to laugh about regularly.
The casting has been fabulous and each character has justified their role with utmost sincerity and perfection.
Not many songs in this drama but overall sound and bgm is on point.
You will fall in love with the story, and entertainment with satisfaction is guaranteed.
One of the best movies in 2020."
696,"Totally loved the movie.
Direction,screenplay,acting and the story.It was a roller coaster ride throughout
Special mention to Rajkumar Rao who like always nailed it and Tripathi ji with his humour.
Best movie I watched this year"
697,Anurag Basu at his best. He Knows how to use Actors The Gripping Screenplay Won't let you bored for a Second Every Single Performance is Outstanding Bollywood has just few anthology movies but majority of them is best.
698,"What a movie in these times. Dark funny and everything in between is a mess but a happy one. The fleet of actors and their performance was awesome. The female leads had a good part not as meaty as the male leads. I wish I could have seen it in a cinema hall.
Must watch."
699,"One thing which would surely say about this movie is it's cinematography. I mean only in a few indian movies you see you get good cinematography but this is surely one of those
It is a visual treat to watch.
It's background music and songs also enhances the movie.
Acting from each and every actor is good especially the little girl.
It has a very unique concept and I liked the ending.
So above were all the pros and now moving on to cons.
The biggest con in its slow pace it feels that sometimes it's being dragged away.
Second con is not that big but it needs to be addressed is that it's cinematography sometimes looks overexposed.
Final verdict-- it is surely a one time watch"
700,It's overall good funny movie with each detailed character... Little lengthy but overall fantastic... But you give full time to spend for the long 2 and 1/2 hr movie.... Just go for it
701,"Amazingg contains everything like love,action,drama,comedyüî•üî•üî•"
702,"Wow....
2020 ki best movie.
It contains crime , drama and specially I like it for comedy.
Little bit long but overall so entertaining movie."
703,The film is just awesome. Good screenplay and well executed. Everyone has done great job. Its a must watch film.
704,Each and every point of the story have been joined so properly that it's a task to find a mistake in it. It's hilarious a great watch after a long time watch it won't regret it!
705,"4 stories cross path, literally shown in the screenplay but has only random coincidences which was very evident by the storyline that, these parts were pivotal to the rest of the story writing. Other than that random chaos, talking about the good parts was the center piece mesmerizing acting of Pankaj Tripathi, Abhishek Bachchan's maturity in emotions and rajkumar rao in bits and pieces . Surprisingly comic moments delivered by the actor playing the cop."
706,"Dialogues are so pretendable. Very few are good. But overall the movie is strechy, lazy with senseless comedy scenes. I like classy comedy, this one is foolish."
707,With such star cast & director this product is very poor as per expectation. Only pankaj tripathi is superb.
708,"I actually had really high expectations from the movie after watching the trailer, and the movie also started off well. But I don't know why they have portrayed all the women in the film as materialistic cunning characters who are simply using the men in their lives. Be it Fatima, Sanya, Asha or the nurse girl, all of their characters are shown as selfish with the guys portrayed as emotional fools. The only women who were strong or positive were the little girl and the head nurse.
I had high hopes from a director like Anurag Basu but it seems people just can't seem to get the notion of equality or feminism right."
709,"One of the best movies of 2020..unexpected n hilarious
...n abhishek he s so underrated ..one f the best actors n bollywood."
710,"Rajkummar Rao, Pankaj Tripathi and Abhishek Bachchan are standout performers in the movie. All other actors are also really really good, even those actors who have a very little role have done absolute justice to their role. And the little girl Inayat a.k.a Mini is simply outstanding and so cute.
And the movie is a masterpiece. Amazing Direction (Hats off to Anurag Basu), Screenplay, Story, Comedy, Emotions, Acting. Everything about this movie is flawless. How everyone has their own story and how they are all interlinked in some or the other way. After such a long time I got to see such a marvellous movie."
711,"This movie has it all, one of the best movies to come out of Bollywood in a very long time. Don't let the silly religious reviews stop you from watching this gem."
712,Good movie to watch..... I was really bored of Bollywood poor plot movies but this movie has brought some sense back.....
713,"I happened to watch it. Thai movie shows a perverse portrayal of characters. Drags Hindu faith unnecessarily and mocks it, be it Ramlila characters. We need to find a way to stop this hindu hatred rampant in bollywood"
714,Very good movie. Excellent direction and acting. Loved the AB storyline and his presence. Had missed him in a good role / movie for long time now. As usual Pankaj Tripati was outstanding as well. Ending could have been better but liked the movie.People need to be stop being offended by small things. I think moat of negative ratings are because of this and has nothing to do with quality of movie
715,I genuinely loved it and even there was some sad and unfair parts of the movie I wasn't angry because that's what the message was that life isn't fair. They made the life compare with Ludo that how different characters are related in little world and how they change each others stories. I say you should definitely watch this because it's entertaining and not waste of time.
716,Very mediocre script. Not impressed a bit. 5 stars only for Pankaj Tripathy. Waste of talent & resources.
717,"A very good movie , every thing is good the songs are soulful , the concept of movie, the direction , everything is suberb .Every actors put their suberb performance ."
718,Really well made movie with 5 stories intertwined. Watch it.
719,Amazing .... anurag basu is such an innovative director in hindi film industry ..with such a unique style of making cinemas..hats offf... to him... really enjoyed this film....
720,"It has comedy, drama, love story, and all. Watch it all at once and it will be worth your time."
721,Amazing script...sattu bhaiya shandaar.must watchable movie..Netflix finally salect this type of content
722,"One of the best after a long time .
It's not so easy to maintain all the stars or multiple stories in a single movie but this one . Hats off .
Every story is more than perfect and linked .
Deserves a big screen release .
Super duper hit .
Must watch."
723,"Such breath taking direction and acting re-defines indian cinema, absolute brilliance! It shows what a gifted director can do..really loved this complex storytelling. Music is refreshing too. Go for it without a doubt, its worth your time."
724,Something more than extra ordinary by Anurag Basuüåö
725,Amazing performances by each and every actor.Abhishek Bachchan's acting was top notch loved till the end. RajKumar rao as always took his role into a different level and Pankaj Tripathi just wow.
726,"Worth watching, an entertaining blockbuster. No need the promotion. Fans will be there."
727,I'll not call it overhyped or something but this movie is like a whole some of everything the acts make you ahte someone laugh at some fantasize and even love a mixture of everything.
728,This movie is just beautiful its best plus point is its cast every one was just flawless and pankaj tripathy and rajkumar stood out as best
729,"Great acting by all the actors.
Pankaj Tripathi is my all time favorite."
730,"It was all blended so well, never felt confusing. Great acting by everyone. Great direction heads down. Amazing music."
731,Excellent work by Abhishek bacchan and Rajkumar Roa. Story develops at nice pace.. comedy is decent. Personally i feel like role of Rajkumar Roa was very tough...but he was simply amazing in this film..superb acting..!!
732,"What an awesome movie !!!
I loved the movie....Great Story , Great Climax....."
733,"Beautiful gift to this Diwali, Amazingly written, and well executed , every story and their little tangent makes you like the movie even more.Must watch."
734,Ohh what an experience And fun ride. Brilliant pankaj tripathi And all round Star cast
735,"After long time I saw a good hindi film..
Every thing just perfect..
Everyone doing their job very well..
Must watch.."
736,"Wow ending no more, just watch it, you will die to watch it again"
737,"Just watched Ludo movie and I just compared the art of storytelling with other big banner movies of Johars, Chopras, Bhansalis....and found it difficult to remember name of any one movie of these big banner names which could match the art of storytelling that Anurag Basu has.....And what about another AB......Abhishek Bachchan.....he simply rocks, his intense looks speaks volumes, as of now he is certainly much ahead of his contemporaries as far as acting is concerned...Pankaj Tripathi, Rajkumar, Sanya and all others are as usual excellent......"
738,"A truly masterpiece , Anurag basu ,you are a gem , anurag should direct more movies, what a story mai to fan ho gya anurag sir kaaüôèüôèüôè"
739,Movie not worth watching at all. Only Raj kumar Rao has done justice to this movie
740,"By mistake, I watched it with parents.
Contains Profanity and ***."
741,"The movie itself and strategies to attract an audience are nice. But, I will write the reason why to not like this movie.
1. Not suitable to watch with family. It contains lots of abusive (language) dialogues.
2. I do not like the way a religion' mythology is portrayed.
3. Shows that society people can have a sexual relationship with whom-so-ever and when-so-ever an individual want (even if they are married). Gives a wrong message to society.
4. Movies must give a good message to the society. As a result, the nation and society could develop. This is completely missing and misleading the youth through this movie."
742,Tried to mix stories wastage of time. Also mocking hindu gods is unnecessary and questionable.
743,"Real bad movie, director seems to be working hard to join ends. Dry jokes, bad dialogues. Just waste of time"
744,It was a little bit enjoyable plus plot wasn't that much good. And as I said it's a mid movie . Don't expect too much.
745,"Boring film.
Avoid the film. Poor acting.
Save yourself from wasting your time watching the film."
746,1 hour into the movie and couldn't make out the start and end of the story
747,The movie started off with a lot of promise but lost its way along the way nevertheless reached it's destination at the end.
748,Wrost flim..I didn't like it... here they are making fun of our Hindu religion by making fun of our lord Shri ram...ram Leela is purest thing for our religion but they are showing it like this. Have shame on them....
749,Hinduphobic in every way. Would the director have guts to portray other religions in the same way? I don't think so.
750,It has become a trend to demean Hinduism. It will not be tolerated.
751,"Let it be 5 star in acting and all, as it has so many good talents
But always mocking one particular religion is the ur daily habit hence u r not worthy of even 1 star"
752,"No better budget ..no better experience ..
weste of time and money"
753,Change the spelling a bit.. LUDO nahi LODU naam rkho
754,Not even worth your time pass watch. Makes no sense at all. Pathetic story line.
755,"Actors madarchoe, director madarchod, writer to maha madarchoe."
756,Good movie but deliberately mo king n abusing gods to demean Hindus was the biggest disappointment.
757,Do not waste your time watching this anti-India propaganda spread by Bollywood. The story is boring and acting is cringeworthy. This movie will fill you with shame and guilt on being an India. Avoid this mental trauma.
758,How a director could find a plot so Boring. Expected much better from anyone with Bengali roots. Feels like the plot is just a cover up to run an agenda. Getting so cliche and pattern is evident in these new set of series. Highly disappointed.
759,After half of the film you will loose interest of the character's.
760,"It's about what a dark place BOLLYWOOD is. Boycott Bollywood atleast till it becomes a safer place.
Viewers still watching Bollywood movies will make fun of this. But they don't know that their money is indirectly helping the illegal activities to grow which happen behind the screens. Lage raho *facepalm*"
761,"Nepokids done very bad performance,why these fool nepo kid doing action.
Nepokids have zero knowledge in action ,still getting movie ??
Why?
Due to this fool nepoliyan kids many top actor who have no god father is suffering."
762,The movie is based on hindu phobic. It can show clearly how the movie production house target hindu culture
763,"What to say, nothing to watch in this movie. Highly disappointed with direction script sorry telling by this movie . Such an amazing subject but poor presentation on screen. If have seriously too much time to waste then only watch otherwise do surfing browing or any other stuff rather than watching this high noise less drama movie."
764,"I was not expecting it, so much boring and sucking content"
765,"One more tatti movie, with same agenda of making fun of some religion.
Bollywood is such a disgrace to nation."
766,"Dont watch save money ..give to poor ..stay happy
play ludo instead"
767,Hopeless movie . Boycott bullywood druggies. Donate your money to charity. Scoundrels need to be slapped each one of them
768,"The most scriptless movie of this decade.
I got headache after watching this.
Also it is produced by Dawood"
769,"If one ignore the movie laxmii, this is the worst movie of this year.. literaly wasted my time. üñï"
770,"Boring,unnecessary screen time ,poor dialogue delivery ,poor acting.
What's wrong with you Bollywood?
Learn something from foreign film industry. Even iranian films are of better quality"
771,Do not waste ur time....filthy poor story armature direction....
772,"Another Hinduphobic movie to have come out of Urdu wood. Blatant Hinduphobia started with PK and was ignored, is slowly starting to become a regular feature in such movies. Stop watching such content so that film makers learn their lesson."
773,Jostory and jokes are so bad..boring..Literally slept whole movie....
774,"Ludo is ugly cliche presentation of comedy in violence, sex, abusive language with backdrop of psychopath."
775,"Complete nonsense in full movie, unnecessary jokes, again intentionally targeting hindu God under cover of freedom of expression.... Lousy story and direction."
776,The movie has nothing concrete to show! Boycott bollywood is trending for a reason. Waste of time n money.
777,"First of all, No one should support any bollywood content, not even 1%. thaliwale bachchan log sits with the elite group and what that elite group is everyone knows."
778,I have watched thousands of movies; Either this is for cool kids; Or I dont understand the movie; I dont get the 10 star reviews; This movie has good directing; But story writer made a long movie; could have ended in 100 min;Actors were great; there were many cringe scenes; But I didnt enjoy the movie; I felt like the concept was similer to De Dana Dan;
779,"Ok,I will try to make my review as simple as possiblePros
1)Brilliant script
2)Powerful energetic performances
3)Interesting characters
4)Engaging music
5)Cinematography is a visual treatCons
1)Abhishek Bachchan's story was unnecessary(although his acting was great)
2)Story become too complex, could have been made simpler
3)Some of the incidents are unconvincingIf you loved the trailer of this film you will surely love this film"
780,"See for yourself. Perfect acting...Nice to have the two great üëç actress of Dangal back with totally different üëå roles.
Basu did a great job with so many turns"
781,Four different stories converging in an Interesting format with twists and turns. A dark comedy with nice ending. Worth watching.
782,Amazing casts and movie direction. Worth watch! Ignore the low rating and just watch the movie.
783,"What a masterpiece. So proud of you Anurag Basu.
It's Sholay of new era. Perfect 10 score in every aspect I.e dialogues, story, narration, direction, cinematography, acting by each and every actor and what a beautiful background score and hilarious use of old song'O beta ji'
Salute to every one involved in making of this gem of a movie"
784,"You will be surprised if you watch this movie for the first time. Story telling, BGM, Acting all are so smooth and perfect."
785,Could have made in 2 hours. Watched for Rajkumar Rao
786,Seriously don't know what is going on in this movie !!!
787,Good plot and its fun to watch.Watched this movie for Pankaj Tripathi and R Rajkumar. They are brilliant actors..I wish they didn't include the nepo kids in the movie..
788,"It is somewhat heartbreaking that Anurag Basu is on a slow decline. We tried watching this movie five times, and manage to finish it in breaks. It might come as a surprise but Jagga Jasoos was better than this. At least it was imaginative. Basu had a certain incisiveness in Life in a Metro, and exceptional dialogues. Barfi, even though largely plagiarised, had a dreamy quality and good music. But with Ludo, Basu simply fails to connect with the audience, getting too caught up in technique. Style takes over entertainment, and for a movie that is more than 170 minutes long, it just lacks a gripping quality."
789,Please DO NOT waste your time and money on this nonsense Movie üé•
790,"One of the most pathetic movie i have ever watched, comes second only to other hinduphobic movies in the past. Such blatant disregard for Hindu Gods and symbols, of course the movie makes snark nastiest remarks, because Hindus are docile creatures."
791,"The more I see Abhishek Bachan, the worse he turns. Despite the director trying is level best to give him as less dialogue as possible, he couldn't impact the acting. Tried to repro Yuva and Guru type style but his expressions are worse than his dialogue delivery Single handedly brings the momentum and quality of the movie down. Story is weird and random. Seems like a by product of very product.
Raj Kumar is awesome. Ab should learn from him."
792,"Ludo is comparable with Super Deluxe. Both are anthalogies. One from the north and the other from the south. One's pure trash and other's gold heap but the trash gets praised, the heap remains unnoticed.In the confusion of story telling, it seems like the director wrote the screenplay on the way to the shooting spot. Therefore, all the actors are confused in the film. You can take screenshots of various characters in the film and zoom in their eyes, visible confusion.Diversity? One Malayalam speaking character doesn't make the whole film diverse. One coloured cast would've made that. With all these white washed men and women, the director depicts white supremacy through this nonsense drama.There's so much wrong with this series. It's hypocritical, has no proper characterisation like the character pinky - the most unstable character I've ever seen. Her story was prolonged with nil logic to give an already predictable ending. Being an emotional fool, she calls 'that dancer' guy that. Whatever his name might be, his character was also irritating.The so called 'desi' patriots may shower the film with zillion stars but your real patriotism shows up when you not only support your own cinema but also the other cinematic industries and languages in your country. Duck off now."
793,Boring. Horrible movie. Started interestingly then went no where. Only Pankaj Tripathi was good. Everyone else acted miserably.
794,"Zero was a better movie than this garbage. Heck even thugs of hindustan was better. That tells you how much of a waste of time this is. When you are getting a movie for free on netflix and you still are unable to watch completely, that tells how much of a drag this is. So many characters and great actors were not able to save this. They tried so much to be like Delhi Belly but couldnt come close. Better watch Delhi Belly for 100th time then this big bore"
795,"The plot is very thin. it's a situational comedy-drama movie but not really captivating. Characters are flimsy and don't really hold attention. RajKumar Rao, Pankaj Tripathi and Sanya Malhotra are outstanding. But frankly half the story doesn't seem necessary and seems to just while away time."
796,"Does it really want to double down on bigotry and misogyny to keep making money from the deranged sections of the society, or does it want to take responsibility to be an inclusive and responsible place."
797,"LUDO the movie is a complete,absolute and total disaster!
It's better to stay at home and play the game Ludo with your family!
0/10"
798,Did not like the way how Hindu deities were depicted
799,What a waste of time money and talent. It appeared they thought of creating something different but ended up with a product which is complete disaster.Direction is poor and equally bad is the story telling and presentation. Nothing is aligned to the theme because the central theme itself is not there. You seem to be cheated when one after another scene comes and you are not supposed to apply your mind.So many characters and different story and they try to tie it together but failed badly.Please save time money and don't pollute your mind. You will do a great service to yourself.
800,"This movie was quite a pathetic attempt at a black comedy/satire. It is painfully slow and tiring to watch. The four stories are good but the narration and screenplay is definitely very bad. The most irritating parts are the conversation betn Anurag Basu & one other guy disguised(dunno or care about his name) as Yama & Chitragupta. But some good performance from Pankaj Tripathi who is a delight in each frame and Abhishek Bachhan, as an estranged father. Rest all cast is forgettable and just passable. Won't recommend to watch as I watched it after a patiala peg to just pass the time."
801,"#LudoOnNetflix - #AnuragBasu tries to make different films from what the other Hindi filmmakers create.The problem is, he watches movies of filmmakers like Tarantino, Guy Ritchie, I√±√°rritu and tries to emulate them. Most of the times he blatantly lifts scenes and calls them as tributes to the filmmakers. Fortunately there are no such high-profile lifts here - at least I couldn't figure out any. But time will tell.Just like in #AmoresPerros - where lives of disparate characters collide in a car crash, Anurag creates a story featuring 4 different story lines and how they all get connected, using a Ludo board game analogy.After all his sophisticated thinking he probably feels that his audience has low comprehension skills. So he goes out of his way to explain the purpose and meaning of the film rather than letting the audience figure out themselves. His presence as Yamraaj and the Ludo analogies are yawn-worthy. The music too prompts the viewer in advance on how to receive a scene - Watch out, this scene is going to get funny now, etc.His skills as a Director of Cinematography are noteworthy - especially the predominant use of 4 Ludo colours - red, yellow, green and blue - in many places.Underwhelming when compared to his #Gangster and #LifeInAMetro."

803,Not at all entertaining. I don't understand the hype about this movie. They even made the class actor Rajkumar Rao look bad.
804,Begins with great promise.. Losing grip along the way.. Excelled only in bits and pieces..
805,"We didn't finish it, rather couldn't. One hour of headache was enough. Wasted effort of a talented cast, director."
806,It's a stupid movie I didn't find anything amusing and different I've seen better movies than this.
807,Movies can be made without making fun of Hindu Deities. Trying to degrade god's unconsciously in the minds of customers is a wrong thing to do.
808,"Apart from Pankaj Tripathi and Abhishek Bachchan's acting this movie has nothing to offer. The screenplay, story and plot is obnoxious."
809,Boring movie. No valubile content.Boring movie. No valubile contentBoring movie. No valubile content
810,If a director needs 1 hour to introduce the character of the movie then you can understand that director himself is confused. One of the worst movie of this year. I don't know how it's rating is 7.6 maybe some agency is being hired to hike up the rating.
811,Sometimes I enjoyed this movie but overall I can say this movie don't have story.
812,Total waste of time. Worst way to explain the concept of heaven and hell. Even kinder joy stories are worth compared to this movie.
813,"Simple words - Don't waste time, trying to explain the concept of heaven and hell in the most worst way. Not a single joke worth laughing. Basu one more flop to consider."
814,"I don't know why they have to hurt sentiments of Hindus all the time & I don't know how so many people are cool with this kind of shit. May be because of years of watching movies questioning hindu gods while wearing billa no 786 without questions.
On another note, this is a big nepo product hence the rating."
815,"Certain movies were never meant to exist. This is one of those movie. Not satirical, not a dark comedy, not an inspiring one, not emotional movie, not a message movie, not a realistic one and so on. While watching it you feel like your are watching a mix of Delhi belly(minus comedy) + Yaariyan(minus good songs)+ Thugs of Hindustan(Good actors got ruined). I dont know why people are calling it a dark comedy when it is certainly not. Dark Comedies are Blackmail, Ishqiya , DevD etc. Even if it is, what a bad one.
Only good part is Abhishek Bachan's sequences. Pankaj Tripathi and Rajkumar Rao were trying their best. Everybody other was just there...no significance.Some are giving 1 because of political agendas and others are giving 10 which is a PR of this movie.
Do only watch when seriously you are so bored that you dont want to choose what to see."
816,It's simply amazing every actor played his or her role perfectly.
817,The movie is different and is so engaging. There was not a moment where I was bored. Infact this movie is a good one by bollywood after a real long time. The concept is fresh and the movie is very entertaining. Full stars.
818,"Started on a high, decelerated towards a lower level at the ending.
But it was a great attempt, should not be missed. A very good dark comedy!"
819,"Typically Anurag Basu movie. Amazing movie after ""Barfi"". Brilliantly Directed, amazing cinematography and mesmerizing music through which you can feel the movie. Movie was literally like the game of Ludo. Completely unpredictable. He conveyed very serious concept of Life, Death and Luck in a comedy way. It was the Movie that can keep you attached until the end.
Music and Songs were also good. Timing of each song was perfect with the ongoing situation. May be it can't be understood by typical bollywood audiance. Though it does not have ""Bollywood ka tadka"" it was amazing.
If we talk about acting everyone did a great job. Especially Mr. Pankaj Tripathi. Abhishek Bachchan was as usual, he was him self in the movie no drama at all. Rajkumar Rao was also hilarious. Shockingly, Sundeep Sharama famous comedian on YouTube was in the movie.
Overall it will make you laugh in a new way. Go for it."
820,Post this review only for Abhishek Bachchan. He stole my heart. üíûüíûüíû Don't know why people judge you and compare you with Big B. You have your own style. Just loved your performance. I can watch this movie again and again only for you üíùüíùüíù
821,This is something worth to watch. Kudos to Ludo team. Take love.
822,Awesome movie. Had loads of fun watching it. Recommended to watch.
823,A great time in the above position and drink and drive more traffic and revenue streams the world to eat drink and drink and drive hahaha that's the same will also have the first time since I've been
824,"The movie carries a fun journey within a group of stories whose dramatic strings are mixed into one mold, as if it were really a Ludo game. A good choice for all actors, which is rare in the recent Indian films that have been released in recent years. Anurag is a distinguished director and has a wonderful expressive and visual image like the rest of his recent films. All the songs complement the context of an event without being included. Watching a Ludo movie is like a fun trip that is all about love, entertainment, laughter and a distinct idea behind the scenes of the story."
825,"You will not be bored even a single minute, really great movie with excellent cinematography and story."
826,Laughter is only in bits and pieces. Neither comedy nor suspense.
827,"Do not understand the negative reviews for this one at all. The stories so wonderfully pieced together. Each actor has done justice to their characters. Whilst Pankaj Tripathi & Rajkumar Rao are getting their due, Abhishek Bachchan, ADRK & Sanya Malhotra have been fabulous too. Highly recommend this !"
828,"After a long time that kind of movie with great direction released
Really fun to watch
After de dana dan & malamal weekly, ludo must be get appreciate"
829,The script and acting of all actors was superb but the have shown immoral things.
830,"Awesome story, lovely screenplay, marvelous acting.. This only proves that AB is a genius in acting.. He just need a good director.... Loved it.."
831,Grt performance by actors gripping screenplay. and for anthology direction anurqg kashyap nailed it
832,"Lovely performances ... n beautifully shot...Comedy scenes were below par, could have been better... but nevertheless intelligently interweaved narrative, even in the smallest scenes how characters cross each other's path across many junctures...And thumbs up to Abhishek Bachhan.. he steals the show, obviously along with Pankaj Tripathi.."
833,"In the midst of all the bad things people are experiencing this year Ludo is like a breath of fresh air. The story, cinematography, direction and the performance put forth by the ensemble cast was too class. Loved the movie."
834,"Aditya Roy Kapoor's role was totally unnecessary.
He ruined it for me."
835,"This is a brilliant movie. A work of art made with a lot of heart. I would like to congratulate the director for coming up with such concept of interlinking stories that do not superimpose on each other. Great acting by the entire star cast starting from veterans Pankaj Tripathi, Rajkumar Rao to the little Inayat, it was a treat to watch. All the cast justified there presence, it was a great sync performance. The technicalities associated with the movie also needs a special mention, starting from the colours with which the movie was shoot representative of the board game Ludo to the climax , justifying right and wrong, heaven and hell conundrum, that is the most brooding question of humankind. A perfect 5 star and a must watch."
836,"4 stories of various 'friend/love/marriage' zoned men interlink and culminate to produce a gripping entertainer. Anurag Basu's take on relationship and life deserves an applause that keeps you guessing till the end. Though there are numerous movies on the theme of money and relationships, the final touch of relating it to a game of ludo - sins and virtue are amazing. Definitely worth watching!!"
837,"Overall it's fun to watch with stories crisscrossing and it always keeps you hooked for next plot twist.
The directional style of Anurag Basu and specially the plot interconnectedness will always remind you of Life in a Metro, albeit of different genre."
838,"Well, the only positives I can think of is that the filmmakers were brave enough to try working with a challenging script... also some individual scenes are shot beautifully however the whole is much less than the sum of the parts..
The execution of the idea leaves much to be desired. There are a few solid performances by Inayat, Rajkumar and Pankaj Tripathi... other than that the film comes across as very messy and predictable.. The parallel stories seem to be forced to merge into each other and the movie seems to be pretending to be smarter/slicker than it actually is... Overall I found myself to be quite bored by the end of it.."
839,"An unnecessary lengthy movie (2.5hr) which could have been done within 2hr. Felt more like a musical movie than a comedy. Movie is crowded with some heavy weights but the dialogues are far from being punchy. Acting of Abhishek Bachchan and Aditya Roy Kapoor was usual - non-existent. Rajkumar and Pankaj Tripathi were not utilised fully.People comparing the movie with Lootcase, but this movie is nowhere near that."
840,Watch if u love to see. Pankaj Tripathi.nothing more in story.Avg story .nothing new.not up to the mark but much better to laxmi.lol..
841,Very bad story line...when first start to see first 1 hour was good...but i think they cant handle it in the long run...bollywwod is done!!
842,"Ludo is the kind of film that works because it embraces dank humor early on and rides off all the way into the sunset with it. Not just a dark comedy of errors, the four different pieces of Ludo overlap into each other by way of clever conception and scripting. The good thing about it is that each segment holds good as a standalone as well as part of a meshed storyline. This is largely due to several knockout performances we come across in the film's 2.5-hour runtime.Pankaj Tripathi leads from the front as gangster Sattu, who's involved in a big-money deal. Part of this segment also features Rohit Suresh Saraf as a hypermarket employee and Pearle Maaney as a Malayali nurse (with all her innate Mallu-ness). Tripathi truly knocks it out of the park enacting serious stretches laced with plenty of dark humor. Pearle Maaney also delivers the goods with aplomb, never for once overdoing the Mallu gimmick.Abhishek Bachchan plays Bittu, a local thug who's also a single dad. After being released from prison, he wishes to reconnect with his daughter but fate has other plans. Mini (Inayat Verma - gosh, what a cutie!) enters his life, and everything changes. Anurag Basu picking Abhishek for this role makes so much sense given he's the (real-life) doting dad to Aaradhya. Abhishek gets a couple of emotionally charged scenes and he does good on those. The Bittu-Mini duo is tremendously funny and cute.A sex tape begins doing its rounds on the internet, putting old flames Akash (Aditya Roy Kapur, whose vulnerabilities are put to good use by the director) and Shruti (Sanya Malhotra, who seems to be getting better with each film) in jeopardy - actually, more for the latter, as Shruti's marriage to a wealthy businessman is set to happen soon. A segment that's the equivalent of an adult rom-com, the memorable things about it include Sanya's performance and some hilarious moments, especially in the final act.Alu (Rajkummar Rao), a bearer at a restaurant (and a stage performer), still yearns for his (ex) lover Pinky (Fatima Sana Shaikh) who's now married with a kid. The first half of Ludo makes you believe that this is one of the lesser intriguing segments but what transpires in the second completely undoes that. Rao gets more screentime and he shines, as expected. So does Fatima, in a role that requires her to be selfish and always getting insanely difficult tasks done by her ever-willing ex. The pairing is brilliant and this helps elevate the segment to one of Ludo's best.The connective tissue between the four segments - that of gods discussing butterfly effect, grey-shaded humans, and the comparison of life to a game of Ludo (where's the subtlety, bro?) - is the film's weakest element. Even with a COVID mention, this whole expository stretch felt prolonged, pointless, and indulgent. A multi-narrative film like Thiagarajan Kumararaja's Super Deluxe did away with this and it worked wonders for that one. I'd still recommend Ludo for what it is - an engaging dark comedy with a detailed, well-structured screenplay."
843,"Really well made, funny yet dives into deep philosophies about love, desire and life in general. Loved it."
844,"Some movies dont need 1 or 10 rating bar.. they stand out..so does.. LUDO, A very good watch.. and leaves you with Feel Good Factor.. so many characters and bcoz of that..one can fall in the category and relate to ..one from the line up.. Amazing.. fun movie.. ..a must watch.."
845,On of the best script of 2020. Must watch movie.. each and everyone played the best .. Finally 2020 ended with one of the best movie of the year..
846,"I loved it, being from performance from all the actors. With a twist involving regional actors from Malayalam industry as well. I have watched more than couple of times. Background music and Songs are apt too. Great movie to watch this Diwali or any other Season. I am a big fan of Anurag Basu movies by now. Awesome Dada and the entire cast. You made this Diwali 2020 a special for us!"
847,"This film is a fun ride, despite its length! So much to enjoy...characters, colours, situations, some good performances. I really didnt expect to enjoy it as much as I did since it had been panned by a few, at the outset. But I think tjis is the kind of film which will grow a die hard fan base :)"
848,"Keeps you entertained throughout the time.All actors have performed well. Nothing what I expected which makes it a good movie.Comedy,drama,twists and turns,lil bit of action what else you want from a movie."
849,"6 stars for Rajkumar Rao and Pankaj Tripathi.
They are best. Their part is best and worth watching it.
Nepotism fails again. Poor acting by Abhishek and Aditya Roy. He just wants to act expression less and be Imran Hashmi in films.Just one time watch, movie seems to be lengthy and boring in between when Aditya Roy and Abhishek comes in between."
850,"Gripping storyline, unpredictable twists and turns, well directed. Abhishek Bacchan needs to do more films. Amazing growth as an actor.
The character Sattu was written and enacted so well."
851,No complaints...finest movie of the year...must watch...great entertainer...anurag basu nailed it..
852,"The movie is so good that it will keep you involved the whole time. The theme the dark comedy and timing by Pankaj Tripathi was the best. Also the child artist with Abhishek Bacchan was worth noticing. Sanya Malhotra,Rajkumaar and Aditya Roy Kapoor nailed it. Abhishek Bacchan was also good and was better than expectation. Overall a good movie and worth the Euphoria going along with it."
853,This movie is full of entertainment. You will not got bored in any scene. Pankaj Tripathi and Rajkumar Rao acting is superbb. Totally unpridictable movie in each scene. Wanna watch it again.Pankaj Tripathi comedy is fantabulous üëåüëåüëå
854,"Or at least what these people will say :
1) Political influencers
2) Idiots manupulted by social media
3) Psudo-religious loud people who have no common sense & experience, least of all, knowledge about their own religion! It doesn't matter if they they're formally educated or not. They are essentially brain-dead, regressive populists
4) Automated botsThis movie is extremely Hinduphobic to the point of driving intolerance, but only to these people, who are babies who are not able to differentiate between reality & entertainment, & that too all of a sudden. This is not less than any mass hysteria. Normal, civilised Hindu adults know better & won't fall prey to this nonsense chaotic narrative which is getting on the nerves of sane people. They are following in the early footsteps of radical Islamic intolerance & extremism, which may one day may take the form of terrorism to say the least if it continues.Nothing innovative could be made without these idiocrats ruining everything, but these stuck up people don't even deserve it in the first place, because they can't understand genres, because they've only know one, melodramatic masala genre! This movie will drive them insane because of how finely it's made, instead of promoting the recycled ignorance they like to circlejerk with.The plot is simple & stylistic, & not even challenging, but to these people with below average IQs, it totally could be difficult to grasp the very concept. They are like those lab rats, who'll only react to things that they are trained to be triggered by, while ignoring basically everything else, even the very reasoning & explanation of a scene's purposes. They act as if movies are not influenced by things actually already happening in real life, instead the exact opposite, everytime! Like bad people only exist, because of movies like these, otherwise they're pure of hearts)For normal cinephiles, & fans of dark comedy, this is one of the rare gems from India. Do watch it if you're not easily triggered, because there's nothing Hinduphobic in this, at least not in ways you've probably not already r seen before in school stage dramas!"
855,"Love it!!!!!!
Don't believe the stupid reviews...."
856,"Beautiful Movie, Artistic Masterpiece.The interconnections of the four stories and every character into one single story is brilliantly done.Very refreshing, entertaining, artistic Movie.This one of the best Movies I have seen."
857,"This movie left me amazed with the creativity and story line. Incredible work by all the actors, specially Raj Kumar Rao. Overall, one of the best movies of 2020."
858,"Simple one word movie is must watch. Very good comedy and story telling and writing is very detailed and logical.
Full entertainment in all emotions songs are also good.
Go and stream you will enjoy definitely wherever you taste of movies."
859,"Good story, great direction, some good acting of the characters, Raj Kumar Rao & Pankaj Tripathi outshines. Good to see Abhishek Bachchan again. Some scenes will make you remember barfi. Music by pritam, some scenes just melt you with Arijit's voice in the back.
Good to go"
860,"Bhout Sahi... Hai dhk lo...busss ek or reason mil jaega Pankaj Tripathi k fan banne ka... Abhishek Bachchan ki bhi a acting kamal hai...
Or Sayad apko Aditya Roy Kapoor ki story line touch kar jae...
Sare stories ko well connect krke rhka gya hai... Kahin bhi bore feel nhi hua... Kamal ka direction or story hai..."
861,"Something different after so long ,
You wont regret watching this ....
Go for it ‚≠ê"
862,"Never expected the movie to be this good.Enjoyed through and through.Each and every character was brilliant and the way the plot revolves around one another, how characters meet is all too funny!!Nothing feels out of place, if you consider to accept this is a dark comedy movie!Loved it. Amazing movie!"
863,"Anthology at its very best. All the characters have played their role exceptionally well!!. One star is cut because their are few anti-hindu/ anti-National dialogues. Please don't spread your propoganda in the movies too. Anyways, I've made an honest review as it's genuinely good movie"
864,"4 movies in 1
Also Best Actors of Bollywood
Rajkummar Rao
Fatima
Aditya
Saanya
Abhishek(First time in life loved his acting)
and our best actor innayat(child actress)"
865,"Awesome movie
Awesome story line, unique concept, great acting by all the actors.
Pankaj tripathi and Abhishek Bachchan nailed it by their acting performance.
A must watch movie...."
866,"Anurag Basu and team did a Great job
This Film should've been A theatrical Release seriously but whatsoever it will get what it deserves ,the right amount of Audience for sure"
867,"Don't mind the one stars and ""hinduphobic comments"". This ain't a movie for them. Fly out of those cages and relax. You will have a good fun time."
868,Must watch! New benchmark of Storytelling..This is Anurag Basu best and kudos to the entire star cast...this is the best Diwali Gift..
869,"Great movie ,one can watch with family , amazing direction and screenplay hats off to anurag basu"
870,"An ambitious Anthology, narrated through five different storylines & contrasting set of characters. Almost in a satirical manner, ""Ludo"" as a Dark Comedy; tellingly portrays realistic personalities we get to witness on a daily basis.
The format of 'Anthology' though delved into time to time by many creators before, it still remains as 'unpopular terrain', In a dire need of exposure. Thankfully Anurag Basu is there to help.His expertise in filmmaking once again shines through. Anurag's Understanding of cinema has always been unexampled in taste. So is the case with his newest endeavor. Incredibly picturised with conspicuous vibrancy & efficaciously written plot, equipped with a bunch of poignant performances; the treatment here is almost flawless. Albiet a bit lengthier in terms of its duration, the screenplay does a fantastic job of blending all the stories which crosses each other's path on quite a few ocassions.A special mention goes to its brilliantly composed Soundscore.
Each Song as a vital piece falls into their designated places, meanwhile also helping the storyline to progress.For these kind of Artsy-Craftsy representations, one would need a competent set of performers.
And Mr. Basu successfully managed to assemble so. With his apt direction, he has carefully given ample time & screen presence to everyone for establishing their discrete identities. Having such a supporting presence behind the camera, it always helps to bring out the best in an actor. And that shows here as well.
Abhishek Bachchan, Rajkummar Rao, Pankaj Tripathi would be my personal picks from the bunch.My only little gripe would be about its closing message. They tried to convey lifelong lessons through mythological/karma references, however their inadequate attempt failed to reach any sort of resolution."
871,"This movie is an example of artistry of good cinematography. It does require to apply a bit of mind and intellect to relate with the metaphor of ludo. So don't watch it ,if you are looking for a movie where you don't have to apply your mind. If you appreciate the art of film making and watch good craft,this is for you"
872,Excellent screen play ..Every character has been crafted to add details to the movie .
873,Amazing movie with awesome story and acting all actor performance is very good and clever engaging story with a very good direction
874,"Enjoyable in parts as story unfolds story of individual characters.It's treat to watch Pankaj Tripathi and Raj Kumar Rao.Fatima Sana Shaikh is surprise package here, looks stunningly beautiful.A good watch over the weekend!"
875,"Different Story Line, Shandaar Acting and Shandar song, Shandaar direction"
876,"Great and peaceful movie, Abhishek, Rajkumar Rao, Pankaj Tripathi and other actor acting is very good"
877,"Ludo by default is the best movie of 2020. Before i go on with the review, I would say i am appalled by people giving it 1/10 review and saying it is Hinduphobic I mean common there is zero reference to any scene. Probably facists see everything from your myopic view. Get a life. Coming to the movie the story is about 4 different stories of different people coming together. Initial 30 minutes might be confusing for some people but once you go beyond that you will see the storytelling power of Anurag Basu. I have never been his fan but this stands out. The actors have done a fabulous job, cinematography is exceptional and kudos to the editor who has meaningfully edited such a complex narrative. Watch it to feel the experience. Will also look for other reviews who would elaborate on what they found so offensive."
878,The movie is really good and the stories have been woven really well. Characters are well placed.
879,Ludo starts off fantasticly with multiple plots converging at a common point. Somewhere in the middle the script looses its plot to be brought back on the track again.Decent performances by everyone with standout performance by Rajkumar Rao and the ever so effluent Pankaj Tripathi.The movie would have been much better and tighter had Anurag Basu decided to edit out some portions.All in all a decent and honest attempt to make a film which Guy Ritchie is a master off.Definitely worth a watch. Had it released in theaters it would have ran to full houses by just word of mouth publicity.
880,"They have tried new concept and it's really good.
Even actors are good but bit lengthy still worth your time.
And people who has given 3 star and below. Either they did not understand the movie or they are people who would give 10 star to a movie like baaghi 3."
881,"Simply mind boggling. Go watch it!
All the actors acted really well especially Tripathi and Rajkumar Rao."
882,Superb screenplay and acting. Definitely worth watching
883,"Fantastic movie by Anurag basu, Pankaj sir nailed it. All actors done brilliant job"
884,"Excellent work by the director to chain the events with comedy , Rajkumar Rao and Pankaj Tripathi again showed their acting prowess."
885,Great acting with some very funny moments. Just watch.
886,What a brilliant narrative this movie has and the dop has done a sic job! Must watch I would say. Should've promoted the movie more though!
887,"Reminded of the gold 'Lock, stock and 2 smoking barrels'"
888,"A genre that still has to find its holding in bollywood makes this a worth watch.
Great acting.
Pankaj Tripathi is a standout again.
More hits than misses in this black comedy
Keep humming 'O beta ji'"
889,Best movie ever made by bollywood. Highly recommended. Movies like this might win an oscar for india. Great acting by all the actors.
890,"This movie has Anurag Basu written all over it!
The cast itself is so good,it makes the direction and plot look even better! It's rare to see movies with dark comedy do well in Indian cinema but this is brilliant ! Reminded me of Snatch and Departed. Hopefully we will get to see more movies like this made in India in near future!"
891,"UNDERWHELMING ASPECTS :-
40 minutes extra.
Didnt remained honest to the original theme and forcefully showing the sentimental elements.
putting so many romantic and classical songs which do not suit the dark comedy genre.
The filmaker do not remain focused to the original plot and loved the universe of the film so much that he put so many unnecessary things which ruins a beautiful storyline.
A storyteller in the film is just not required. Most of the indian audience is intelligent enough to understand whats going in the film.
Average acting by the dangal girls.
OVERWHELMING ASPECTS :-
STORY IS JUST BRILLIANT.
The concept to analogy of life to ludo is original as well as interesting.
Rajkumar , pankaj Tripathi SHINES. the new actors which i dont know name of looks in form. Abhishek bachhan performaned surprise you with his good acting.
Really average acting by the dangal girls ( sana and fatima)
Pankaj Tripathi comic timing is the backbone of the film.
The characters developed by the writer are really well written. If the filmaker stayed honest with the original theme of the film, this could give competition to pulp fiction.editing and screenplay is really amazing. It is due to director blurred vision we are not able to enjoy the film the fullest.
PATHETIC FILMAKING"
892,"One of the best dark comedies of Bollywood, Hats off to the creativity and story telling ability of Mr Anurag Basu, mind blowing acting by all actors, quirky and humorous, overall an amazing master piece...a must watch :)"
893,Awesome movie with smart direction n top notch acting. Raj Kumar Rao and Pankaj Tripathi deserve special mention. These kind of movies should be promoted more n more. Movie making is a Art and Anurag Kashyap has proved with his excellent direction skills.
894,"First things first Rajkumar Rao rocks in the movie, Sanya is so pretty & talented though Fatima has a better role. Kapoor is good, handsome and surprisingly new character of a poor guy, which doesn't match his looks but great job. Tripathi never fails to impress and talk about Bachchan- u know what he feels like AR Rahman's music- feels better when u keeping observing, though I had doubts about his performance earlier, in Guru he made sure to address them. Anurag Basu- really gifted: not at all cheesy & conventional, though could not the Barfi! magic, I donno how he's going to beat THAT.PS: Little girl is so cute"
895,"Everybody is perfect in their respective roles. Acting, Direction, Story, Screenplay, Music and yes the GOD too."
896,You won't regret after watching the movie and even the way the movie had been portrayed is really brilliant
897,"New age bollywood which is a class apart. Solid performance by Pankaj Tripathi, Rajkummar Rao and the rest. Fun, entertaining in an intellectual way. The likes of k.Jo is done and dusted. Anurag Basu proves he is a master of movie making and cinematography."
898,"Now this is called Entertainment!! Entertainment!! & Entertainment!!I generally don't write movie reviews but this movie Ludo made me to write and thank Anarug Basu for this gem.I couldn't stop laughing for the entire movie.
One of the best comedy movie I have watched in my life.
Creator of movies like Judwaa-2 & Houseful-4 should learn something from this movie & from Anarug Basu.
Strongly recommend!!"
899,"Roller coaster of a ride. All characters are well defined. All stories are converging brilliantly. Gud acting, great direction, refreshing and very entertaining."
900,What a film... I just love it.. Excellent perfomance by all actor n actress.. Storytelling also good
901,"One of the best movies I have seen in recent times. Next time when someone asks me why Bollywood doesn't make movies like Inception, I would reply that many people don't even appreciate much simpler plot like this one. Hope the movie succeeds."
902,This movie is fun ride Pankaj Tripathi and RR completely nail their comic timing
903,"Great movie to watch, nice plot and direction with good acting makes this movie a worth watch"
904,"The trunk scene , the funny characters , use of vintage music ,connection of stories
really reminded me of 'pulp fiction 'and also
guy ritche's 'snatch '"
905,"The film takes forever to introduce all the characters in the story. Also, could have easily done away with 30 mins of runtime.
All actors did a decent job, but Raj Kumar Rao and Pankaj Tripathi steal the show."
906,"After a long time, here is a movie that truly entertaining every second, and very fast paced. Loved Rajkumar Rao as always, exceptional performance. He keeps proving that he is a class in himself. Pearle Manet actually did a great performance as the nurse. Pankaj Tripathi was amazing as well. Overall brilliant perormamve by everyone. The story is a mix of tales all merging into one, with money and greed playing a central role. From Alu's (Rajkumar Rao) divine sacrificing love towards Pinky; to the goon in Pankaj Tripathi who does have a good side to him that he showed with how he kept the nurse's honor, to Bittu (Abhishek Bachhan) yearning to be with his daughter; and the story of the ventriloquist; and last but not the least Pearle Maney and the quest with the bag of money; everything was fun. Absolutely loved Rajkumar Rao's love story and the climax there. Can certainly watch again."
907,Must watch for everyone good screenplay good acting good direction
908,"The film is the most recommended one for everyone. The story, the characters are so good. After such a long time I got to see such a film in Bollywood. Very interesting story, the audience won't need a break for this film. The way film is been made around ludo one of the lockdown viral games, made it more awesome. The climax of the movie is really good."
909,Pankaj Tripathi is too good nailed it so as others.
910,"Thanks to anurag sir for this amazing movie , movie is full of comedy, love story ,drama i am love it sir amazing story,and screenplay to good"
911,"Just watch it once, and you will enjoy it.
Acting by Pankaj Tripathi, Rajkumar And Abhishek is the soul here."
912,"What a movie..Great acting, story, brilliant direction ,screenplay,dialogues..this movie teaches us beautiful lesson of life..Best entertainment of 2020 along with equally wonderful acting from everyone...
Anurag Basu knows how to play with the audience. This is yet another example of creative film making by the Barfi director..."
913,"One of the finest movie in recent times, what a beautiful amalgamation.. simply top notch...hats off to anurag basu and his team for pulling such a movie... Movie never gets bored, it keeps you hooked for entire duration.."
914,"Keeps you on the edge of the seat, with brilliant actors playing in a serious yet comic role. Hats off to all."
915,"Anurag basu is the best story teller.Everyone acted so well. You have to be smart to connect the film to a game of ludo. Basu cracked it so well.Everyone acted so well especially Rajkumar, Tripathi and bachan.Music was superb. You will love songs.Please do watch and entertain yourself."
916,Overall movie is good though there is a drag in the middle part.
917,"Must watch..... Everyone played their characters really good....
Hats off to Pankaj Tripathi and Rajkumar Rao....
And lastly, Anurag Basu.... U r masterclass....."
918,"Fab job on Direction, Script, Characters, Performamce, Music. Pankaj Tripathy, Abhishek B, RajkumarRao at their best and perhaps all other actors. Twist is mind blowing. Unexpected at many turns. A sheer delight and refreshing. Such movies deserve Oscar stage def."
919,The menu scene of Rajkumar is awesome. It is an abstract movie.
920,Intelligently altered Crash beautifully added humor with crime like in bruges what a masterpiece....hats off Anurag Basu.....
921,All in all it's a great movie but this guy makes it even better. The way his dialogue delivery is makes the film much more than what actually it is.
922,"Really I didn't expect it to be this good. The direction and the humor are at it's best. If you are thinking you should watch it or not, take my suggestion and, watch it.
Everyone in the movie was brilliant. Only one thing, it could be little bit shorter. Still worth a watch."
923,"Refreshing and Best Film of the Worst Year 2020. Awesome Story telling and no character will disappoint you at all.
Kudos and Hats off to Anurag Basu, he nailed it yet again."
924,By far this is the best cenima i have watched in 2020The direction is absolutely flawless. Its a must must watch.
925,"Anurag Da is at his best again. Everyone has played their part so well, notably Pankaj Tripathi, Abhishek Bachchan and Rajkumar Rao. You are glued to the screen and don't wish to leave the movie in betweenWell done"

927,"You'll love this movie. The ensemble is too good. Mr. Tripathi, if you are a fan, you'll fall head over with this work of his. Impeccable dialogue delivery and to cap it off - the end seen - too too good! You'll love it. Every other character, Mr. Rao, Mr. Bachhan (Junior) and other cast.. superb work."
928,"Must watch if you like dark comedy. Screenplay, direction and is too good."
929,Nice movie all character are interconnect each other ... One of the best movie I ever seen ... Do go with critics .. watch movie first it's great experience and emotional movie..

LUDO is excellent movie and performance of all actors is very good but one complain that may be Abhishek bacchan's story different ending not satisfied with Abhishek bacchan s story end . otherwise movies is excellent . pankaj tripathi rajkumarrao performance is outstanding no doubt and other cast of movie also do their nice job.if you like unique and different plots movies then please watch this movie .
938,"Anurag Basu hits the home run with LUDO!
I am writing this review after seeing the mixed reviews by some film critics and some illiterate people who seem to have no clue about film-making as a medium or as an art form.
I hope more and more people watch this film as its entertaining and beautiful to watch. I could only find one or two faults or missing pieces which pale in comparison to the actual plot of the movie and how deftly it has been crafted. Anurag Basu is the most underrated director in Bollywood. Hopefully Ludo will give him the adulation and fame he deserves.
Heartening performances from Rajkumar Rao and Pankaj Tripathi!"
939,"All the performance done by actore and actress is good , Abhishek is doing great work in emotions and rajkumar is also doing emitional comedy which is also great ,Pankaj expression is üòÑ and costar is doing their great work .love it .nice ending and great job"
940,"Muxh better than Laxmii. Please watch
Namaste and you will enjoy this movie"
941,"Movie hits a bullseye with its screenplay and acting department but fails to impress with its direction.
Directed by anyway basu, ludo is a story of 4 sub stories of different characters which crosses each others paths throughout the movie.
Made in some ways like pulp fiction, the snatch, this movie is definitely a very strong attempt which pass in some but fails in most.
First thing first pankaj tripathi and abhishek bachchan, great performances by this two guys. Give pankaj any tough role, he will play it so well that it looks like an easy attempt. While Abhishek playing a role of small time goon who comes from jail and just want to see his daughter puts all the emotions in the movie to make one of his memorable performances.
Aditya royal Kapoor, rajkumar rao and sanya malhotra are definitely stars of tomorrow, great work by them. All the other actors did a decent role and were looking good in their characters.after such great performances what went wrong is the fact that direction is way too weak, even after having such a good story line, its dialogues fails to make you laugh unless its from pankaj tripathi who can make you laugh on anything. cinematography is average and bad VFX makes it look worse. songs doesn't give anything to the movie, they are boring and doesn't catch you ears.
At the end its a great work but not at all the parameters, cameo role played by anurag basu seems as if they did it within 2 hours without any proper script and putting thinking into it which made it look bad."
942,"I really enjoyed it, its very entertaining, the story is good, the movie is full of twist and turns and unpredictable like the game of ludo, the director did a great job, the music is a treat to ears, and acting of every actor even side actors(e.g. that inspector), supporting actors did great, Raj kumar rao sir is just amazing, he gave his best and he is the best."
943,Finally a good movie from the industry.... Must watch you will enjoy it.
944,"This is one of those comical which will keep you hooked up to your screens till the end. Storyline is very gripping. Though everyone has acted brilliantly but if one person deserves special mention is Rajkumar Rao. Watching him doing anything on screen is fun and he has done that again.
Don't miss it. You wont regret."
945,"Abhishek A Bachchan : I love your intense eyes as usual.
Rajkumar Rao : I can't stop laugh when u cry and dance
And all the cast are fabulous. The story is unpredictable. Lot of emotion in this movie and left you with smile on your face."
946,"One of the best of 2020
This movie is something you should definitely watch. A wonderful movie wonderful acting done by actors. Rajkumar Rao always like absolute fabulous. Pankaj Tripathi is also very good just like always but in a very new kind of role. Abhishek Bachchan just stole my heart. He made me cry in such comedy movie.
Cinematography was osm. Anurag Basu has done a very good job also acting and directing. Dialogues were very good.
Ultimately must watch for all. This will make you feel very good."
947,Must watch this twist and turns of ludo...u will enjoy it thoroughly! Amazing work of each nd every character of this movie especially pankaj tripathi. Adi nd raj were both really awesome.
948,"Must watch
Abhishek was superb
Rajkummar Rao was hilarious..
Aditya Roy Kapoor finally is in his form after long time.. ( his performance was a pleasant surprise)
Pankaj tripathi is a legend
Fatima was cute
Sanya malhotra was natural
Overall an entertaining film"
949,"All actors are just lit in this. This is a dark humour class film. Rajkumar Rao has done a fabulous job like always. His overacting was way too fun to watch. Abhishek Bachhan acting was too good. He made me cry in such a comedy film with his acting. Pankaj Tripathy is the dice of this ludo he is the main attractor of this film. All others also have done a very good job. A special mention to the little girl Inayat Verma she will make u smile and feel good with his acting.
This is a class film only class audience would understand this masterpiece and for other this is just a film with some humour. Don't watch this with your family some bad words and a scene is there. Other then that it is a great watch for all. One of the best of 2020."
