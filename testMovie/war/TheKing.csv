0,"For this type of movie I thought the director got pretty much everything just right. The acting, the sets, the music, the storyline, everything worked to give us a thoroughly enjoyable film."
1,"An incredible film from beginning to end, historically accurate set and costume design, performances of the actors was fantastic. I love love love the accuracy of the portrayal of combat in full metal plate armor and the violence of battle. I love that they blurr Henry V by Shakespeare and historical drama incredibly well."
2,"Not sure what to expect when watching this. Truley gritty film. The acting was superb.
The battle scenes were truly realistic. Nice change from Netflix terrible films they've put their name on."
3,This was epic. The acting was amazing. Near perfect writing. The actor who played Henry (Timothee C) should be a big star. Great presence. Take the time to watch this. I'm glad I did. High quality stuff.
4,"WHEN OPERA BECOMES REALITY / One of Netflix's strongest titles. The work simply becomes reality and it is like being in the theater all the time and time flies. A stellar cast that plays its part in a credible and passionate way. Timothée, once again, confirms to be one of the most promising stars of the current decade and Michod has only done what was not done since the days of Ridley Scott's Gladiator."
5,Beautiful cinematography with fantastic performances and direction. I understand why Chalamet is the next big thing now. The bloke from Twilight was good too.
6,"I went into the movie with modest expectations. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but I absolutely wasn't expecting this. I was blown away by this movie. It kept me interested from start to finish. Even though the movie contains a lot fewer battle scenes than previously expected, it was still intriguing and made any battle scene that much more rewarding. This could be the movie that helps Netflix win their first academy award for best picture. I highly recommend that anyone with a Netflix account watch this. You won't regret it."
7,"I'm grateful that Netflix are pumping money into films like this and is a great sign of things to come.This movie has some great acting, a superb script and some great sets and costumes. This all adds to the authenticity of this 15th century English period piece. I do have a few problems with the film like some of the 15th century language can be hard to follow and I don't think this film will be as good on Netflix as it was when I just saw it at the Venice film festival.Despite my issues with the film, I think it's great and would recommend it to any film lovers."
8,"Whether it was historically accurate or not, this was an excellent movie with great acting. The battle scenes were realistic and the story flowed well. I wish it was a series it was that good ."
9,"Yes it's not historically accurate blah blah but it's a damn fine piece of filmmaking. Great script, direction, performances, cinematography and a wonderful soundtrack. The casting is spot on. And though I've seen it a number of times now, I still get a knot in my stomach before the battle. THAT says something! Patterson's portrayal of the Dauphin could have so easily have been clownish, but it is tinged with menace and works so well. He chews up every scene he's in. This is very good cinema indeed."
10,"Once I went to a medieval times restaurant with my father. The section we were seated in was the ""Green Knight"" section and the Green Knight turned out to be the villain of the play before us. My father got a bit excited by this. At one point the king declared that he was making peace with the Green Knight's country. My father then shouted ""No peace, war! War!"" I feel like almost everyone in this movie is doing the exact same thing for Hal.Now, I'm quite a fan of Shakespeare as well as something of an amateur historian. I have a small library of books dedicated to British history and the monarchy. So I was excited by the announcement of this film as it touched two passions of mine. Needless to say, it wasn't quite what I thought it would beIt's very clear that this production is only minimally based on the famous Shakespeare plays. They borrow the characters and follow the same plot to a degree, but it bears very little resemblance to the plays beyond that. This isn't about the matter of language, but more the feel and actual story of the plays.That's not always a bad thing. The character of Falstaff is not just a cowardly buffoon like in the plays, but an interesting man and capable warrior even. Still a drunk yes, but his character is richer and has more depth than in the plays.No my main problem is Hal. Though acted well, Hal just feels so very out of place in this story. Like I said about my father, Hal is the king desiring peace while my father is everyone in England desiring war. Hal feels like a 21st century man in a medieval drama. It just doesn't fit, especially not in history.The real Hal, or Henry V, was actually a man of his time: a brilliant warrior and quite the opposite of the pacifist he seems in this film. The fact of the times is that war was popular in medieval times, and war with France was very popular in England as they had quite the rivalry. There is a reason Henry V's son, Henry VI was deposed twice: peace, especially with France, was seen as weakness. Henry V would have been raised from the cradle to believe France was the enemy and England should defeat it. It just struck me as so completely out of step to have Hal be so against war. Perhaps they were afraid they would make him look like a warmonger, but that would have been easily enough to avoid. Rather they fail to grasp that this is a historical film, and the truth of the matter is war was the most effective means of diplomacy and brought about glory and popularity. There is a reason Richard the Lionheart has a better reputation than he probably deserves in England: war equaled strength and in that day a man wanted to be seen as strong.It's not a bad movie. The acting is good, the story isn't bad either, but it clearly wasn't meant for people like me. If I didn't understand the tine period as well as I do, know the plays so well, nor have studied the true history as I have, I probably could have given this a higher score. It's a good drama, but Hal just stands out as out of place and nothing like a true medieval king."
11,"Why do they do this? Who does Hollywood think it is exactly with this unadulterated fiction? To have the temerity to fictionalize major facts of the life of an historical figure takes some kind of elevated opinion of yourself.Here's a newsflash: Henry V was the member of his family most keen for war with France; Henry IV and Thomas favored peace. For reasons known only to Netflix, precisely the opposite is portrayed in this film.So Daddy disinherited Henry and made Thomas the heir, really?? (NOPE) So Thomas was green and got killed in battle before Henry IV died, really?? (Both sons were seasoned warriors, and Thomas died well after Agincourt.) So Falstaff (Sir John Oldcastle) heroically died at Agincourt, really?? (Henry executed him in 1417.) There's much more, but the point is made.So sick of historical figures being transformed into someone they weren't to suit whatever message the screenwriter is pushing. Just. stop."
12,"Just saw this film and it is captivating. What ever you do don't believe the low rating some others have given it because it is not accurate and you will need to question the motivations of those scoring this film so low when it is worthy of much more. Maybe a touch of jealously cause it is a Netflix film. The acting is superb with a great script, crisp cinematography and wonderful sound. The director transports us in the 15th century and we are captivated by the situation King Henry V finds himself in. Surrounded by corruption and men who are willing to kill each other for property and status.All the cast was brilliant and the two lead actors were exceptional.The only negative is that it is a touch long. I say that it was long but I can't see anything that could have been left out. I saw it at the cinema but I think if you were watching it at home you could pause it and still return to be immersed where you left off.I hope we see more from this team as they did a great job."
13,"Overall I enjoyed watching this movie. I like period pieces like this and Netflix delivered again. The acting, cinematography, and battle scenes were fantastic. Unfortunately the story line is interesting but completely false with its character depictions and timelines. Not only did Henry V's brother Thomas not die prior to his father as shown at the beginning of the film, but he actually served as a commander in the English Army and died 8 years later well after the battle of Agincourt which is shown at the end of the film. Sir John and the French Dauphin also don't historically die in the battle of Agincourt as depicted in the film. Sir John actually loses the battle of Patay a few years later against Joan of Arc and becomes the scapegoat that is blamed for the defeat. The Dauphin is actually crowned the King of France after Joan of Arc wins a few important battles 14 years after the battle of Agincourt. There are other historical inaccuracies as well but I've made my point. Like I originally said, I enjoyed the movie and applaud certain aspects about it, but ultimately the director/ writers should have done a little more research first."
14,"I have mixed fillings about this movie. First of all it's a very nice piece of cinema with an epic and realistic medieval battle.But ... bloody hell ... when you try to make a movie about an historical caracter why can't you get your facts straight.The historical facts, as related in this movie, are all wrong.I know that Americans don't really care about the worlds History and try to make it entertaining instead of relating true events as they actually were.The battle of Agincourt was a military masterpiece, there is no need for stupid inaccuracies.Even Shakespeare was more accurate than this.Make historical movies historical again."
15,"Had to track this down to a Curzon in Oxford to see this, well worth it. What a gem of a film. Absolutely excellent, top class acting by the whole cast. Although not totally historical accurate, it's not far off. Loved the rawness of the battlefield, very realistic to what I imagine it would have been. This I would hope should be considered as best film awards contender without a shadow of doubt."
16,"The battle of Agincourt as presented in the film has nothing to do with the actual events. And cause of this was a huge disappointment. It makes no sense to me why is it so difficult for so many movies to stay in the facts.
When it is a film about the battle of Agincourt I want to watch and learn what actually happened those hours, and not a fantasy story."
17,"Henry V's Agincourt campaign was an important event, and very dramatic - excellent subject material for a feature film. Why would you take that riveting subject and spend a considerable amount of money making a film about it and then litter that film with gross historical inaccuracies? Henry IV did not try to disinherit Prince Henry. Prince Henry did not kill Henry Percy in a duel (Percy died in a pitched battle 10 years before Henry IV died). Prince Thomas was not killed by the Welsh shortly before Henry IV's death (he died fighting the French six years after the battle of Agincourt, eight years after the death of his father). Neither prince was an inexperienced soldier by the time of Henry IV's death - both were experienced captains with multiple campaigns behind them. All of these depictions in the film are major historical errors - and that's just the first 15 minutes of the film!"
18,"This is a pretty good movie, but I'm only here to nitpick one little thing that bothers me.The writers for The King could learn something from what the writers of The Last Kingdom got right -- timeless language. The dialog in The Last Kingdom is entirely believable because they are saying things that sound like what people in the 9th c. might say. But when a character in The King says that reforms are easier in a time of ""regime change,"" that is very jarring. It's very contemporary, 21st c. terminology. Why not just write ""when there's a new king?"" Period drama would be well served by editing for anachronistic language."
19,"AS a swords and sorrow epic this is okay, good performances, pretty locations, but why bother to pretend that it's about Henry IV and V? Not to mention Falstaff? A straight fiction could have worked; but this half-assed gesture in the direction of historical accuracy is just irritating. And it sure drags."
20,"Doesn't follow history or Shakespeare, the main protagonist were nothing like their characters in history. I'm a bit of a historian so got quite annoyed at this film.
Other than that I found it very bleak and slow. The fight scenes were more realist than the normal over the top ones but on the whole it was quite dull"
21,"The picture is good. But it is very disappointing that half a millennium after Shakespeare, the authors of the film made familiar images much more flat. The point is not even the grimacing Pattinson, diligently depicting a parody of a French accent. Not in Catherine Valois, who speaks to the crowned groom as a modern feminist (in the play, and in medieval life, she could only refuse to kiss before the wedding). It can be forgiven - after all, Shakespeare's ""Henry the Fifth"" is just a kind of propaganda, well below his true masterpieces. But the authors raised their hand to the most sacred - Sir John Falstaff. In my opinion, this is the best character created by the genius from Stratford. Funny and disrespected coward, drunkard and chatterbox was, nevertheless, a figure of tremendous charm, easily overshadowing other heroes. And yet, despite his weaknesses, he was wholeheartedly attached to the prince. When the young king breaks with the past, rudely treating the old knight, this decision can be considered fair, but you still sympathize with Falstaff. A comic jester suddenly turns out to be a deep tragic hero, and the death of the abandoned and forgotten Sir John becomes the most touching moment of the ""sequel"" to the brilliant ""Henry the Fourth"". As one of critics rightly noted, Shakespeare killed this character primarily because ""the public's sympathies for Falstaff's humor could not be reconciled with the idea of statehood, which logically was supposed to complete the play."" However, ""Henry the Fifth"" as a work of art is not comparable with its predecessor, so Sir John Falstaff with all his vices finally won, as life always ultimately defeats the cold state machine.
What do we see in this movie? The director turned an old cowardly drunkard into a wise, laconic warrior and a brilliant strategist, whom Henry the Fifth draws closer to himself and puts him at the head of his army. The French are defeated. And with them, the author buried Shakespeare in the mud too. As a result, we have a nice plot, from which hardly anyone's heart will get pinched, and which will be forgotten in a couple of days."
22,"I had the opportunity to see this movie in a theater a few days ago. I'm pleased to say that it was not a waste of time. I was thoroughly caught up in the story and invested in the characters, particularly Hal and Falstaff. I am not a medieval expert nor am I that familiar with the works of Shakespeare, so don't look to me to pick this movie apart based on those terms. Was this movie perfect? No. Was I entertained? Hell Yes! Every single performer in this movie gave it everything they had and its all up there on the screen. The filmmakers and the actors have my respect and gratitude. And kudos to David Michôd for landing Timothée Chalamet to play Hal. This kid is something else. He is absolutely fascinating to watch. By the way, don't get Hal mad at you, he is somewhat of a bad ass. So here's to a great time at the movies and I look forward to watching this again at some point when it shows up on Netflix."
23,"For a while now Netflix has been flirting with the idea of releasing a film which is universally loved by the critics and audiences. An also one that could be recognised and respected by the film industry. One film to make people take Netflix seriously when it comes to its own film content it produces. I'm happy to say that this is the first on the list..........for me anyway.Now I know this film has done a good job for one really good reason. It got someone like me to watch it in the first place. I will be brutally honest I don't care about any stories or films about medieval times or Shakespeare...........any of that stuff. Its just not my thing...........thats not to say there aren't any great films about this topic cause there probably are. The reason it got me to watch it was the cast first and foremost. The talent that was involved in this film really drew me in because it was a combination of new talent and stars we are accustom to.Timothee Chalamet is a very young talented actor.............I am a firm believer that he will be the biggest film actor in years to come, because not only is he great but he chooses such interesting projects to do. Being English I was obviously going to be more critical on the accent of his.........well I was gonna pay more attention to it..........but wow extremely good. Overall a really really good performance. The other big standout and again with a great accent is Joel Edgerton............my oh my what a great and understated performance from Edgerton. He fit very well into the part and definitely was a great presence in the every scene he was in. Obviously Sean Harris was really good as well..............and shoutout to BATtinson.........oh sorry I mean Robert Pattinson, with another great accent in some incredibly tense and uncomfortable scenes.But what also separates this film from others Netflix has released prior is the directing, cinematography and production design, they are off the chain in this film. From start to finish this film is extremely beautiful to look at..........a very grounded feel to the film, Adam Arkapaw has done a great job. But more praise should be given to David Michôd because his direction is brilliant.........some beautiful sweeping shots of the battlefields are incredible, they are heart pounding chaos. Definitely feels like a modern shot film but at no point is there an overuse of CGI or silly aerial shots that would feel out of place. Everything is shot in person on the ground to make it feel as if you're there everything step.Overall I really enjoyed the film its really good 80% out of 100, if it can get someone like me to not only watch it but to come out loving it then I cant see why it wouldn't do well with its actual target audience. Although saying that there are probably some historical nuts out there taring this film to pieces, but oh well !! Trust me I'd give it a go! Finally some top quality film content from Netflix !!!"
24,"Let's get the simple stuff out of the way first:1) The people who made this film have never cracked a history book in their lives. They don't know anything about the period the film is set in, or the real people and real events they were trying to portray. Apart from getting some people's names and a couple of locations right, they fail at literally everything. It would actually be hard to get this much wrong if you weren't deliberately trying to do so. With so much going on, statistically one would be likely to get more right simply by chance if the script were being handled by chimpanzees.Shakespeare took his share of liberties with the story of Henry V, but then, his audience was literally Henry's descendants, so he had a particular motivation to portray things in a certain light. One cannot imagine what the writers of this mess had as motivation. The story they are telling is supposedly a blend of history and Shakespeare, but they utterly fail at being faithful to either the events or the spirit of both. I suppose I could have just left this portion of the review at ""they utterly fail.""Agincourt, the battle on which the entire story revolves, was a brilliant and incredibly dramatic battle. A faithful depiction of the battle would have cost no more resources, been no more difficult to portray or for the audience to follow, and would have been vastly more visually impressive and dramatically impactful than the bout of silly fantasy we are instead treated to. If you watched that and thought, ""This is what a medieval battle would really look like,"" your education is lacking and you should consider picking up one of Bernard Cornwell's excellent novels of the period as a primer.2) I cannot for the life of me fathom why there are two 21st century characters shoehorned into the middle of this 15th century story. It's not just that Prince Hal/Henry V does not even remotely resemble the real person- it's that even if this were a made up character in a fantasy tale he would still appear six centuries out of place. He is entirely composed of silly 21st century notions about kingship, war, relationships, etc. And Catherine of Valois is even more ridiculous than he is. ""All monarchy is illegitimate,"" says the future queen. If that wasn't a laugh line, I don't know why they included it.3) I could go on, but this is getting long already, so I'll summarize. The pacing is awful, the dialogue is often painful. I'm not one of those who enjoys Shakespearean language (I'd rather have a faithful modern version of the wording), but at least Shakespeare's dialogue is intelligent, unlike this nonsense. Some of the performances would probably have been impressive if they hadn't been wading through such utter nonsense. And why is Falsaff here? He's a fictional character ripped from Shakespeare, but entirely divorced from the actual Shakespearean character. He simply makes no sense, despite Joel Edgerton's herculean efforts.In short, fools may like this film, but it is bad history, abysmal Shakespeare, and poor film making. I highly recommend watching Henry V (1998) instead, for a much better telling of a similar story."
25,"I really hope this movie gets the recognition it deserves, fantastic performance from every member of the cast especially Chalamet. Fantastic script and beautifully shot , I've not sat forward in anticipation while watching a movie in such a long time. The battle scenes were heavy and brutal and an incredibly eye opening visualisation of medieval combat.If you have to choose between the hype train that is Joker and The King I wholly recommend this movie, you will leave the cinema much more pleased with how you spent your last two hours. This is really a movie that deserves much more recognition ."
26,"As a re-enactor who displays this period, I was excited to see this. I wish I hadn't watched it now. Why is it so hard for Hollywood to do a little research into our history and at least try to get some of it right. Even Shakespeare didn't get it this wrong.
If you are looking for a medieval romp then you'll love it, if you know anything about this period, don't torture yourself."
27,I don't understand the high ratings this mess of a movie has received. To call it historically inaccurate would be an understatement. Prince Hal having a duel and killing Hotspur??? The Dauphin killing children outside the English camp??? Falstaff (a creation of Shakespeare) given a prominent role??? Henry V offering to fight the Dauphin one-on-one before Agincourt??? This film took literary license and turned it on its head.
28,"*This is a short Non-Spoiler Review*
I was shocked how the film was so good, I believe that this is the first Netflix movie to be that good. The performances from the cast was Nearly perfect and I see that the hero of the movie was the one who casted them. War shots were too good and they Remind me of Game of thrones war shots. All in all, this is a must see movie of 2019. Bravo Timothée Chalamet!"
29,"I was blown away by this film. Timothée Chalamet & Joel Edgerton were golden in their respective roles, once again. Have watched it multiple times and still want to see it again. A+ work all around, one of my favorite films of 2019."
30,"This was a great film. I am biased because I am a history nut. But I enjoyed the characters they were all casted very well. The cinematography and the score is simply amazing. And the story was good. There were times when you were lulled into safety by the talking of politics and other underhanded endeavors but then you would be shocked at the brutality and intensity of the battlefield. I specifically love the way they portray medieval combat. Because it wasn't pretty like the stories say. It was bloody, brutal, and disorganized. I would recommend this for people that like a good drama or for the history nuts out there."
31,"A dark brooding medieval tale that by the end has descended into farcical melodrama held together only by the performances of Chalamet as Henry and Harris as William Chief Justice and even they are failed by a post modernist script and borgiaesque politicking and murder in the final 20 minutes.
Neither a Shakespearean reimagining nor a full blown historical drama this effort seems to be unable to make its mind up and fails in both instances. Now it is often said that historical films don't need to be completely accurate to be entertaining and that's true but this is 100% inaccurate and that effects its entertainment value because even someone with the most basic knowledge of the events will eventually say ""hold on?""
Where to start?
Henry IV; a schizophrenic usurper played here as pantomime villain and a waste of the talents of Ben Mendelsohn.
Hal; the drunkard wastrel of Shakespeare duly played as such here by Chalamet supported by Edgerton as Falstaff but both are pretty unconvincing as such and of course he wasn't, in fact by this time he was playing an active part in the running of the kingdom.
Hotspur; the eternal rebel played here really well by Tom Glynn-Carney, who I thought would have been a better Henry, but no he wasn't killed in hand to hand combat by a reluctant Hal in front of two armies but died at the battle of Shrewsbury a battle Hal wasn't at.
Thomas; younger brother of Hal, no he didn't usurp Hals position, no he didn't command at Shrewsbury, no he didn't die in Wales, he actually acted as adviser to Henry IV and V and died on Henry V's French campaign, why do this when the reality is more interesting?
William Chief Justice; really well played by Sean Harris but the reveal of him not being the loyal minister but a scheming capitalist who manipulated the king into a war so he could profit is utter nonsense and a pretty poor commentary on recent US foreign adventures, it's also grossly insulting to the actor who has to mouth the final scenes and to the audience who has to listen. Yes the character existed but he resigned when Henry V was crowned.
Falstaff; played straight out of Shakespeare by Edgerton but with the addition of being a military genius who plans Agincourt, utter nonsense and why? In Shakespeare the character has a purpose in this he has none and Edgerton looks lost despite being one of the writers.
The French plot; there wasn't one, oh no it was that nasty chief justice! Henry wanted glory and didn't much care how many englishmen had to die in France to get it.
The Dauphin; was Robert Pattinson deliberately hamming this up? A quite bizarre performance that jars against the sombre mood of the film and guess what? The Dauphin wasn't at the battle so didn't die there and certainly wasn't murdered by a bunch of muddy soldiers on the nod of Henry in what is quite a disturbing scene.
Agincourt; a famous battle both in Shakespeare and history so plenty to go on but here is the worst part of the film. The English were in retreat and the French were in their way so they had to fight. Yes it rained and the ground was boggy. No a valiant advance guard didn't advance up a slope led by Falstaff. No Henry didn't hide in ambush with no armour along with the rest of the soldiers, these guys are nobles for God's sake they fought with their own class. No the French didn't trot down a slope armed only with swords, they advanced on foot with halberds, half pikes and great swords, if they had been mounted they would have used lances! Everyone wore livery otherwise who would you know who to kill or capture for ransom? Metal autonomons rolling around in the mud just looked ridiculous. The reality is far more cinematic than what we see; Henry and his men at arms stand their ground between two woods where they position their archers - you know, the famous English longbowmen who are barely seen! The French knights advance on foot enduring an arrow storm which kills many and forces them to bunch up in the mud so that they can barely raise their weapons then we have the savage hand to hand at the English line as waves of the French nobility sacrifice themselves. Had the film makers not seen Helms Deep? Had they not heard of CGI? The battle was both woeful and wrong.
Was anything any good? Well yes, the score was excellent and the overall mood for the first two thirds attractively dark but in the end it was a failure and in this day and age with the technology available and a talented cast it shouldn't have been."
32,I found the film to be very enjoyable but was left despondent when I found out it was mostly a work of fiction. Why do Netflix have no respect for history?
33,"Inaccuracies aside this film made a valiant effort to look, and sound historical and up until the actual battle of Agincourt (basically its climax) it was almost getting away with it. Agincourt, however was a huge disapointment.
I was a member of a longbow society, have been to Agincourt (now Azincourt) have visited the battlefield (virtually unchanged) and the impressive museum in the small village. I have read extensively about the battle and know what a mere 60lb draw weight longbow can do over 150 -200 yards [The archers of 1415 used between 90 and 120 lb bows)
This film rode roughshod (pardon the pun) over the whole progression of the battle - The desperate state of the English army, the squabbling and competitive lack of unity amongst the French nobles, the terrain of the battlefield, the use of swiss mercenary crossbowmen, the whole class divide between the archers and the knights they so ruthlessly slaughtered, all in favour of a jolly romp in the mud with chaps punching away at each other in suits of armour (DON'T try punching someone in a suit of armour, it hurts!) . Even the killing of the prisoners (still a sore point for the French) was portrayed as almost as aruthless, post battle act of revenge. The battle was stilll raging and the English just didn't have enough guards for what was in effect another army in their rear."
34,"I don't care about historical accuracies. I don't care about Shakespearian references. This is an entertaining and gripping movie, smashing it with the acting and cinematography. Good stuff."
35,"The film is a completely fictional non-historical film set in a 15th century England and France. Perhaps the most annoying aspect of the film is how they make Henry V ""woke"" with a ludicrous ending. Interjecting current fashionable sensibilities into historical films is a crime against both art and history. As far as a fictional movie goes, it's OK, with great set design, wardrobe and a tremendous battle scene but the lack of respect for the subject matter makes me unable to rate this film any higher than a woke 4/10."
36,"A very very good movie. After a slow start, the movie really picks up pace once Edgerton gets involved. He is excellent as always. Chalamet is excellent too as the young Henry and I honestly didn't recognise Pattinson. He is really really good.Overall a very good watch. Without a doubt one of Netflix's better efforts."
37,"I am genuinely surprised by the amount of overwhelmingly positive reviews for this film.There are some good aspects. Cinematography, costumes all were well done.The story, writing, and acting are all over the place.Are we suppose to feel something for the stupidity of this naive king who invades another country without asking a single, simple, question for any real motive as to why?Was the ending suppose to be some sort of surprise?It was obvious from the get go it was all a 'master plan' and this supposedly peaceful, King, who didn't want anything to do with his father does exactly what his father wanted done.It was even explained in the movie what his fathers regime wanted (invade France and Jerusalem). And so of course this moron king falls for it without asking why he would invade another country over a ball, and a ridiculously obvious planted 'assassin'. Among other stupid reasons that had me shaking my head less than an hour into the movie.The two scenes where he wants to do some 1 on 1 fighting instead of a full on battle were laughable.I felt nothing for this character or storyIn the end its just a dumb story about a dumb kid, who becomes a dumb king, who falls for dumb reasons to invade another nation.There is absolutely nothing epic or grand about this movie. I wish the French would have kicked him. The King of England was too stupid to live.Terrible film."
38,"You can tell a good film, when you're so involved with watching it, that time has passed without you noticing it. I knew where it was heading for early on, but the depth and development of the characters is sensational. If anyone gives this less than 7/10 then you should go back and watch it again."
39,"I'm all for re-staging Shakespeare, but the bard doesn't need much help.Over four centuries ago, he was already dealing with 21st century issues: the crisis of leadership, separation of Church and state, the clash of cultures, class struggle, and the intersection of God, politics and history.The big question about *The King*, is ""why?"". Timothée Chalamet, hobbled by a weak script, is swallowed up by his role. Prince Hal Shakespeare's ultimate King; Chalamet is barely a prom king. And the bard's iconic Falstaff, who scoffs at authority and believes honour is never worth death, is mysteriously transformed here into a military hero who leads a suicide mission.*The King* was made for fans of ""Game of Thrones"", not for fans of Shakespeare. If you love the Henry plays, check out the BBC's 2012 production, ""The Hollow Crown"", a more faithful adaptation with Tom Hiddleston's superb performance as Prince Hal."
40,"It may not have been overburdened with historical accuracy but what a bloody well made movie - glad I saw it on the silver screen rather than on Netflix. It's well crafted, well written (a couple of dead spots in the script) and overall quite engrossing.Happy to have spent my hard earned going to see it at the movies.Joel Egerton is building quite the compendium of compelling, nuanced supporting characters and its a pleasure to see him work his craft (both acting and co-writing) here."
41,"Says Prince Thomas to his brother Hal:
'You're trying to upstage me.'
To which Prince Hal replies:
'I'm not here to steal your thunder.'
Are they American high school children? Well, yes...
Cringe-making.
Oh, and nothing could be less Falstaffian than the slow-witted, uncharismatic Falstaff in this flaccid pastiche."
42,"There was Sir Laurence Olivier. There was Kenneth Branagh. There was Tom Hiddleston. Then there is this pile of rubbish and a mumbly poxy American kid that spends all his time concentrating on trying to sound English rather than conveying any emotion or character, or actual acting. Awful. The most ""helpful"" reviews sum up who this is for: Good even with the '15th century language'(Oh Lord...that's 21st century English trying to sound ye olde timey with the occasional use of ""mine"", hon). Numerous mentions of the two young heartthrobs because they're kids and have never seen a decent actor before and the general quality of Netflix films (which we're ""jealous of"" for some reason not because we're history and film buffs with decades of experience and know what a pile of turd is oh no it's something to do with Netflix and jealousy). So not a high bar, is it? WHY did they run with and ruin the Shakespearean version with Falstaff? Why does this exist? A Joel Edgerton vanity project that's why. It has been done MUCH better with MUUUUCH better actors and it is painfully noticeable this is inferior despite nice enough cinematography, a good budget and a THEORETICALLY decent supporting cast (but they couldn't save it either). This is just no Hollow Crown or Henry V. This is a mess. Despite the fine wrapping and bows I just mentioned, the Emperor has no clothes. For a nearly 2-and-a-half-hour film it is shockingly lacking in depth and character development or any general personal investment. I couldn't care less if Henry died of Pox and Agincourt never happened. That might have actually been interesting and new if it did happen. Falstaff was unnecessary, un-Falstaff and I felt no real emotive connection with Henry or Falstaff, which is a special feat of mediocrity because usually I am deeply conflicted and impacted over that relationship in several tellings. I get that it might be nice to see Henry V with Falstaff in easy language rather than the usual screen versions that are the Shakespearean language play (imagine how the '15th century language' dude would fare in those ROFL). But it was a gamble that failed imho. If they tried for an historically accurate Henry V without Falstaff maybe I'd be more forgiving - at least that would be something a little new but they bollocksed that up on a spectacular scale ne'er before seen as well. Truly awful. It's not a douche or a turd. It's a douche turd. It's the absolute worst of both worlds - Shakespeare and ""history"" and destroying both. It's barely watchable and is outright slow and pointless for more than it should be, some serious things come off quite cheesy or rushed and will certainly not stay with me in the way The Hollow Crown did at least not in a good way. Sean Harris, a FINE character actor couldn't pull it together - even he was weirdly quiet and mumbly. I can imagine Edgerton going: ""OK guys like quiet mumbling means something is REALLY important and serious OK because the calibre of acting and the script itself obviously can't convey that on its own OK? And...... Action"" Yes it's that bad. Pattinson's accent not good and annoying and the dialogue is poor but why pick on him? Everyone's accent is put on and bad and the dialogue is poor. Why bother casting an American as English and an Englishman as French? And Australians everywhere with bad English accents too. Who are you people giving this 9-10 stars and what is actually wrong with you? Are you 10? Have you not seen historical movies before? Or even just... movies? Like this was not a good movie period, not just on historical terms. The acting was woeful. The script was truly horrible. The ending just lost it another star (yes, it's taken me two days to finish this monstrosity I couldn't bare it). ""Great Speech"" hey? You people have obviously never seen a decent movie or heard the Shakespeare you boggle my darn mind. It was ludicrous and badly acted. Accurate Agincourt? Get out of town. Shiny things and a big soundtrack and budget do not a good movie make. On St Crispin's Day that was a speech but ahhh whatever who cares the CHILDREN rating this obviously don't. Just end. When will this film ever end? What a spectacular waste and abomination. The ending made me want to stab myself in the head. This truly takes the ""Hollow"" from ""The Hollow Crown""."
43,"While I appreciate Netflix for still financing big budget historical epics in a time when no major studio does, I couldn't help but feel quite disappointed by David Michôd's THE KING.Once you look past its stunning visuals, there is really not much substance to the film. Being almost entirely deprived of historical markings - e.g. location informations, time specifications or even just names of historical figures - and filled with inaccuracies, THE KING basically fails as a historical film. Now, that in itself wouldn't be a problem as shown by films like BRAVEHEART, which are highly inaccurate in their depiction of historic events and figures, but nevertheless work from a cinematic perspective. Michôd however, who clearly wants his film to play out as a dramatic character study, never achieves depth, empathy or even a sense of urgency for his story to be told at all.Watching this film, its obvious flaws made me think a lot about last year's OUTLAW KING. But while Mackenzie's Netflix epic at least had an exciting core to it as well as somewhat compelling characters backed up by memorable performances, THE KING is ultimately a dull and sluggish two-and-a-half-hour drag. And who on earth thought casting Robert Pattinson as the (English-speaking!) Dauphin of France was a good idea? At a time when this man is starring in films like GOOD TIME and THE LIGHTHOUSE, Michôd's script manages to craft a role that may be good meme material but is embarassing to watch and almost an insult to Pattinson as an actor.In the end, THE KING is a very average film, potentially boosted by great visuals and an undeniably high production value. Thinking about all the talent involved though, it's definitely one of the bigger disappointments of 2019."
44,"First, I have to state the obvious - for a person who is not well-versed in history or simply doesn't care for it one bit and wants some action on the screen with a few good-sounding lines for trailers with a bit of added flavour in the sense of this being set in the Middle Ages - this is absolutely passable and you may even get some fun out of it.For someone who is a little bit more knowledgeable of the history behind the reign of Henry V, the politics of Middle Ages and more precisely of the politics surrounding Battle of Agincourt and the related events and persons, this piece is utterly dreadful. This movie doesn't do justice either to the history nor the Shakespearean take on the events which seems to form the bigger part of its basis.The movie starts out dreadfully slow and seems stretched out for no reason at all. The clear centre of the story is the Battle of Agincourt and instead of beginning out with Henry V being a drunkard for half an hour or even more, this part of it all could've been a lot shorter (this is just my opinion thus far).The moment I felt that this movie is getting out of hand in its depiction of the events that transpired early in Henry V's reign was however when all of the sudden, the English were going into battle, the plot was so thin that I didn't even properly understand that war had now begun, it seemed almost comedic how the Henry in the movie had wanted peace all this time and for the smallest reasons, on almost a whim, decided to go into war with France which was by far a superior force in terms of size and population.
The second moment I felt that this is getting into the territory of being a parody of itself was however when Pattinson came on ""stage"" with his French accent, why on earth was this horrible mockery necessary - it wasn't and it adds nothing to the movie.The third moment which really gets under my skin is the battle itself. The battle is clearly inspired by the Battle of Bastards in Game of Thrones, which is fine in itself but the battle starts to make very little sense when you start thinking about English longbows - which are most famously related to the battle at Agincourt. The longbows were so far off from the French, it seemed two stadium-lengths, that there is no way these could have ever reached the French, the distances in the battle and the way the French fell, was totally absurd.The fourth moment when the movie seemed akin to parody was when the character of Pattinson went on the battlefield. No leader of armies ever enters the battlefield like that and especially in a way that battle would simply stop immediately. This is so weird because in first, the battle was depicted as pure chaos, as should be, then the moviemakers suddenly forget it and it seems like a small brawl where on first signal all quiets down, war doesn't work like that. Then Pattinson just skids around on mud and Englishmen jump on him with no interference from the French. How? What? Why?All in all, the reason I'm writing this tirade is that the movie has so much potential, it looks sublime on screen and really does mostly justice to the era in its depiction of armies etc. But somehow, the simple plot plodded on the actual historic events comes loose at its hinges, Henry V is depicted as this holier than holy character to I suppose appease those wanting to get a modern take on the events in 1415, and to top it all of, the French side of the battle (people who could have been great villains) are simply used for comedic effect.This leaves me with the sad realisation that for all its potential, the movie just isn't worth its running time. This is all the more baffling as flicks like Outlaw King have shown how to do justice to the genre without really having too much to do. This movie however while having all the right bits and pieces seemingly, simply doesn't get the job done for anybody who is actually a little bit familiar with the history of the event or the dramatic take on it by Shakespeare. The betrayal plot added to the events (Chief Justice and Henry V stabbing him to death) is the biggest offender in this, history and Shakespearean dramatisation of the time period have more than enough drama, antagonists and protagonists to highlight on the big screen without this immensely pointless added plot and mockery of Pattinson as an actor.All in all, if you want a good take on Henry V's rise to throne and the Battle of Agincourt, stay away. If you want to netflix and chill with your significant other watching some swordfighting and Pattinson making a French accent, go for it!"
45,"Chalamet is genuinely and truly a great actor. Every frame, every shot of him it's a treat to watch! I wanted to watch this movie on the big screen and I'm glad I did. It was worth it! I know this movie is coming soon to Netflix. Please, go see it on the big screen, it is worth it to pay the full-price ticket, then you can watch it again on the small screen. Loved it from beginning to end. This is one of the first masterpieces that Netflix is bringing this year to the Oscars race. It is really a great film."
46,"Like so many movies it started out quite promising but it got worse and more ridiculous as it went on.
From a visual perspective, it is very well shot and there are some great, intense battle scenes, but there just isn't any substance to the film. The bigger (historical) context is never explained, the story and actions of the protagonists are confusing or make no sense at all.
The young king just stumbles from whoring around in the ghetto into being a considerate, brave and intelligent leader of men on the battlefield. A very unconvincing performance. It would have been a little better had they at least cast a strong Englishman as Henry, but for some strange reason they picked a 60 pound skinny-pants-wearing Israeli. The French prince is portayed as a complete psychopath and idiot. A caricature.
And of course they had to drop in a little empowered female narrative at the end where Henry gets married. If you have half a brain, don't waste your time."
47,"I'm amazed how many good reviews this got. It's incredibly poor on so many levels.The storyline is neither history or Shakespeare, it's absolutely garbage. The Falstaff character is about as useful as a chocolate fireguard and terribly acted.I've no idea why they bothered to have the Battle of Shrewsbury and then not have it and have it decided by one on one combat. That was bad enough but when they stopped the battle of Agincourt to have another completely meaningless one on one combat I finally lost the will to live.The Henry V character was frankly embarrassing and nothing like the historical character or the Shakespearean one either.I've actually no idea what they were actually trying to achieve with this film as it's verging on totally pointless on practically every level."
48,"First I have to tell you that I truly love historical drama. I also don't mind if, for the sake of a more thrilling movie and an accelerated pace you take a historical tale and change it in fitting way.
However, this was not done in this movie, on no level. They ruined a perfect historical tale, which had all and could have taken a lot of inspiration from Shakespeare's work. But they just added the spirit of our current time and unnecessary changes which not just ruin the historical accuracy of the movie, but also the authentic atmosphere of Medieval times.
The dialogues were dull, even outright dumb and the language more appropriate for a modern bar than a royal court.
The French were presented as a total caricature of real people. The king was made a peace activist which constantly tried to kill and torture accidentally, while the background story of the father-son conflict and the war with the French became twisted in so many ways it hurts.Last but not least, what some describe as the climax of the movie: The battle.Horrible, just horrible. They tell at the start what was supposed to give them a chance, but beside some ridiculous scenes, the whole battle turns out to be some sort of mud wrestling. The true value and importance of the bowmen in the battle of Agincourt, the proper positioning and prepared defences of the English, anything of military facts was either ignored or downplayed in one big mud show.
The king going into battle without support, without body guards and anyone around him, like a modern animated action hero is completely out of the context of any battle at the time.I'm not just criticising the lack of historical accuracy in every scene, this would be not enough. They really made it a fantasy movie which lacks even the slightest touch of reality.Talking about the pace and suspense: Did the movie, with all the cobble up of historical and literary themes, make any lasting impression if being seen from a purely action movie perspective? Not at all. The pace was slow, the tension didn't build up and overall it is a forgettable piece of film making.The 4 stars being deserved by the music, camera job, outfit and acting. Yes, that were all strengths of the movie, but with this pace, dialogues, mingling of the story until it was strangled and nothing worth to talk about left, ruined a great historial theme.Kenneth Branagh movie lacked the eerie sound and the ""dirty medieval feeling"" somewhat. Its acting and language was to artificial in a way, since it was based on Shakespeare primarily, but still: It depicted real people, acting like humans do and presented the story in a relatable and historical more accurate way. Branaghs Henry V is on a different level than this piece which could have been great, but was, unfortunately, ruined by bad writing first and directing second."
49,"It's neither historically accurate nor Shakespearean, but the ""story"" it chooses to tell is dull and uninspired. There's nothing in this film that hooks you. No engaging characters, no character development, barely any political intrigue, no spectacle.The only thing this movie has going for it are the costumes and set pieces.Chalamet just doesn't cut it. It's not bad acting but it has nothing going for it. It's quite possibly the worst way to portray a leading role. And we're somehow meant to believe that this guy is a competent fighter? He looks like a small breeze would knock him over."
50,"After five minutes I knew this would be bad, but how bad I would never have guessed. So historically inaccurate I'm surprised they had the gall to even suggest it should be presented under the byline of Biography, Drama, History. It should have be labeled ""Warning, fantasy, under no circumstances mistake the events portrayed as anything but complete and utter fabrication""
One to be avoided."
51,"This movie takes itself too seriously, and not in a good way. It doesn't do the material justice, and I hate to say it, the most disappointing part is Chalamet. I really loved his performance in Call Me By Your Name, but after that something missing in his acting. This one, in particular, I have to say his accent is quite off in many scenes, which really bothers me. The way he talks (always low voice) and his performance in general needs some work. I watched the movie twice, once only listening without watching, and the problem becomes more obvious, especially compared to the other actors. He can't take the sole blame though, as the pace of the movie has some problems too. I applaud his courage to take on this role, but it doesn't provide the sparkle it should have."
52,"As a piece of cinema, this film is watchable. There is enough action and violence to keep you entertained.However, it is entirely fiction. Anyone looking for an accurate movie depicting the build-up and the events of the Battle of Agincourt will be sorely disappointed. The ending is just fanciful and ""woke.""Netflix has made hostage a significant moment of history to really a second-rate piece of film-making. Once you know it never happened, you ask the question, ""why did this film ever needed to be made?"""
53,"This movie is about a king who didn't want to be king fighting a war he didn't want to fight over a petty insult he suffers after fighting a battle for his childish, vainglorious brother. Then, when the war is over (a war in which he is somehow the reluctant aggressor, just to keep up our narrative of contradicting motivations), he gets philosophically eviscerated by a few simple questions, making him look like a total chump after fighting one of the most well known and celebrated battles in all of English history.It's a postmodernist, revisionist mess. About the only good thing you can say about it is the battle scenes were well done and some of the acting was good."
54,This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat and your phone in your pocket. Great movie and cast.
55,"The movie is haunted by Timothee Chalamet's cold, lifeless eyes. Perhaps he screened ""The Chimes at Midnight"" and realized there was really no point in trying to improve on Orson Welles's version of Sir John Falstaff, and his will left him. Or perhaps he watched Laurence Olivier's brilliant 1944 adaptation of ""Henry V"" and was too stunned to move afterwards, and could only shuffle onto the set as if in a trance. Or he might have had a look at Kenneth Branagh's 1989 version of the same play. His wholly affectless face and dull, tired gaze tell a story of a man robbed of all energy, a broken, humbled actor who understands the impossibility of the task before him; the giants of cinema loom large, and though he tries to stand on their shoulders, their combined weight ends up crushing him.The rest of the cast and crew caught the same fever. The movie is empty, listless; it drags along, as the actors mumble into their beards and slouch around the gloomy medieval locations and tedious battle scenes.Only Robert Pattinson seems to have survived intact. He puts on an outrageous French accent as the Dauphin, taunting those silly English kniggits who have invaded his dreary country. Too bad he didn't stick around longer, but it was probably a wise move on Pattinson's part. Lily-Rose Depp as Princess Catherine shows up about twenty minutes to the end to liven things up, but she also beats a hasty retreat in the face of Chalamet's sulky countenance.Everyone else seems determined to fade into the background, as if they were too embarrassed to be noticed. Joel Edgerton gets away with the bare minimum of effort as Falstaff, a Shakespearean invention elevated here to historical standing, and killed off in place of the real Duke of York. Welles left big shoes to fill, and an even bigger suit of armor, and Edgerton makes no effort to fill them. It's easy to forget he's there.It's encouraging to know that you can write and direct a historical movie without ever bothering to open a history book. History is very complicated anyway: the facts, like the films of Welles, Olivier, and Branagh, are best left where they belong, in the past, where they won't get in anyone's way."
56,The actual events of Agincourt are a fantastic story so not sure why Netflix felt the need to change it. The battle was won by English archers and the longbow but there was only two volleys shown in the film?!! Sticking to the script would have made a better film
57,"Timothee Chalamet has to be one of the worst actors I've ever seen. Nothing about his performance is convincing as a king, nor does he have any personality. All he tries to do is put on a practiced expression learned in a modeling cast. Whenever his mouth is opened, it betrays his lack of competency as an actor. His pre-battle speech at Agincourt is absolutely underwhelming and lame. He and other actors in the film are clean-shaven and pretty but in spite of what untrustworthy commenters claim, you can see that many men in paintings had beards at the time. The film tries to be a jack of all trades to attract girls to watch a movie that they're most likely to not have any interest in. It's ridiculous.It's absolutely historically inaccurate and lacking in charm. Last year's Robert The Bruce movie was really historically inaccurate too, but at least it was enjoyable. This one is just bad. What, in one scene, Henry V is walking point at the head of a column into an unknown village? Seriously guys? That would never happen, sorry! There is one scene at the end of the battle where a prominent ruler is killed that is absolutely ludicrous because he would have been worth a fortune in ransom. It's akin to the Joker burning the mob's pile of money in The Dark Knight!Save yourself the time. The presentation is great, the actual substance of the movie is terrible."
58,"A beautifully shot movie, well paced to allow you to soak up the atmosphere of each scene. Stunningly lit in a way that summed up the era - dark and dingy - and finally a battle scene that depicted the complete horror of such a fight. Highly recommended."
59,"This movie has absolutely no bearing on historical fact, so just treat it like an offshoot episode of Game Of Thrones, and if you want to really know about Henry V go to the local library and read a history book.Bill Shakespeare was a one for making up his own history, but that's nothing compared to the dreamers in the Hollywood movie industry."
60,"Making a movie about Henry V without even an attempt at some of the wondrous speeches is either a mark of incredible carelessness, ignorance, or yet more Nutflux Agendae. The highly debated nature of the victory at Agincourt is shrugged off as if we were watching an episode of Oz. That battle has been analyzed from a strategic, technological, and even class-caste system point of view, and only the barest hints of its facets are explored. Okay, so much for historical ""accuracy"". But it actually gets a tiny bit worse. Falstaff does not appear in Henry V, although his death is discussed early on. He is probably the most interesting part of this movie and he may not belong at all. And the battles. The battles. The battles are nearly interminable. If I wanted to watch a melee, I would go to a Ren Faire.
Shakespeare was white and a purported closet Catholic. Is he now another target for distortion, or is this just ""Dummy's Guide to..."""
61,"I will start positive and say that the battle scene was unhistorical but v good in its own right. Clearly inspired by the Game of Thrones battle, it gives us the brutal grappling style of warfare of this period. EDIT: I should also add that the score is excellent.Now to the negative:This movie is boring and spineless. Apparently based not on history but the plays of Shakespeare, the screenplay is utterly uninspired by both. It consists of people sitting in small rooms mumbling modernist platitudes in faux-shakespearean - shot, reverse-shot. Why is Falstaff, one of the most celebrated jovial, care-free characters in literature, a mopey, mumbling, shell-shocked, bearded hipster? When they are not in rooms (or tents) King Henry is at the head of his slate-faced zombie army of Englishmen without personality. Where is Fluellen and Pistol? Where is the conversations with the soldiers the night before the battle? We do, however, get a terrible attempt at a speech - but I will get to the performances later. The film is spineless in its portrayal of Henry V. How do you give this rather bloodthirsty historical figure a character sympathetic to modern sensibilities? Why, make up a conspiracy behind his invasion of France. This is not Shakespeare's Henry either. It seems the writers only made it based on the plays rather than history so they could include an unhistorical riotous youth, and can add Falstaff - in this version, a man of the people who can spout both philosophy and battle-winning strategies. It is certainly not history, but it is not Shakespeare either: it is a painfully dull plot languishing in abject fantasy. While Timothee Chalamet's perfomance occasionally rises to mediocrity, his best attribute is that he looks almost identical to Henry's famous portrait. However for most of the screening time they would have benefited from just using the king's funerary effigy. His performance is risible, and his accent embarrassing. While Robert Pattinson's performance made my skin crawl (I think this had more to do with direction than ability, which is usually strong), he was at least charismatic, unlike everybody else in this film.It is clear nobody knew what they were making with this film. Rather than draw from Shakespeare they came up with their own witless banter that occasionally struggles into archaic form, then plummets into anachronism (Thomas of Clarence refers to Hotspur's head as the 'prize scalp'; obviously not an English cultural notion until encounters with the Native Americans some centuries thence). I won't even mention the historical liberalities in the plot, since it is basically all of it.If you love history or Shakespeare, stay far, far away from this mess."
62,"Beautifully cast and executed.
Nothing was overdone.
Sensitively directed and very well acted.
Well paced,
Nothing stood out as overstated but with great attention to detail.
A battle scene to make you think about what a battle actually is.
And, feminist as I am, I was nonetheless relieved that a woman was not forced into the 'plot' to 'make it fair'.
I'll be happy to watch this again."
63,"I've been a long time fan of Joel Edgerton, and Game Of Thrones is my all-time favorite show, plus I read novels like Wheel of Time, etc, so by genre, this is right up my alley. But this is terrible. Truly awful. It's like First Night bad (if you remember this movie and how bad it is). I guarantee that the ONLY people who like this are young boys who don't appreciate good cinema and enjoyed this only because of the genre. Bad script. Bad acting. Bad movie. The only good thing about it was Robert Pattinson, shock of all shocks."
64,The King is an excellent movie. Timothy and R-Pattz are great together in this Knight drama and interact with each other really well. Solid gold acting from all the performers.
65,"Excellent show. Timothy killed it. I dont care how historically accurate it was, it was really well put together and that was a Friday night well spent in front of the tele."
66,I loved this. Henry V was the greatest English King and it's fantastic to see something new made about him.Loved it and thanks Netflix!
67,"Netflix got this one spot on. Whenever I scroll through their own content I'm largely faced with woke movies that do their utmost to push the political correct theme. I'm just a regular bloke who wants to see regular bloke movies, but I struggle to find them these days. But The King is a blokes movie! No romance, just a gritty historical story that keeps you gripped from start to end. And you'll want to watch it again. Thats my measure of a good film, one I'd happily watch again. Its Braveheart quality, if a bit better and the young lad who plays Hal does a fine job, as do all the supporting cast. We are crying out for more of this type of film and content. We're fed up with politically correct BS that is flooding the market these days."
68,Timothée is one of the alluring reasons to watch this. The plot is slow to unravel but the final battle is somewhat worth the wait. Wish there was more battles but I suppose history can't be changed to satisfy my viewing bloodlust.
69,Gritty medieval drama . If your expecting gladiatoresque style action . You will be disappointed. More of an historical slow burn theatrical drama
70,"Loved the performance of the main character. Incredible combat scenes, good narrative and awesome music."
71,"Afte watching this i was surprised. The real twist and showstopper ca
me at the ending. The entire movie had my attention. Hard to find a flaw in this."
72,"This movie is Absolutely Amazing!!! As my headline says! I don't even know where to begin with this film, but I can says it's Perfectly written Perfectly executed and one of the best filmed movies I've ever seen!. ""Timothy Chalamet"" is one of the best actors of this era and he's a force to be reckoned with, I love him and he makes this whole movie he was Perfectly castes as well as everyone else! If I had to pick a movie that's close to perfect this is it! This Is A Must Watch ASAP!!"
73,"All emotions were so good so true. Strong acting. So much great movie, based on true tragedies. War is War .....no matter you fight for honor, revenge, or to conquer and there will be always blood in war so many blood. If you a soul near to your heart you should not put yourself into war."
74,As a armchair historian and a lover of Shakespeare I was disappointed in this production. Historically and literature wise is nothing like the original. Also it was rather slow and boring. The 90's version was much better.
75,"Sorry but this is so inaccurate it ruins the effort. Every battle and interaction is incorrect. Even with Shakespeare's plot points, it's more theater than historical. When doing a film based on actual events, you have to try to at least have time frames, locations and characters that are true to life as well as the dramatic license of extra story lines."
76,"The movie is interesting at first until the figure of the ""enemy"" appears...It is such a caricature that all the movie seems is a little bit ridiculous after this..."
77,"Compared to Henry IV parts one and two and Henry V by Shakespeare this is routine drama by the numbers.It covers the material and it looks good enough but it has no spark and the pace is typical of those mainstream sword and fantasy series which are earnest and plod through its episodes.The Shakespeare originals are much better, imperfect in many ways, but packed with intrigue and politics and lots of humor, most of it not very elegant humor either."
78,It was awesome and you should watch it even if you don't like movies about monarchy.
79,"As I was watching this I kept telling my friend how miserable I felt the entire time. Everything from the apparent squalor of the time period to the absolute misery of that eras form of war made me feel miserable, and I enjoyed every moment of it. Dunkirk is another one of these films where the entire time you're feeling nothing but negative emotions, however, by the end of it you come out feeling like you witnessed true art. It will forever be incredible to me how artists are able to toe that line so gracefully. Great film."
80,"Wanna watch a satisfying movie, where good and smart English heroes humiliate a bunch of bad and arrogant French villains? Go ahead and watch ""The King"" ! Most actors are great and battles are epic...BUT: if you think historical movies should be historically accurate, FORGET THIS ONE!I checked the facts after the movie... it ruined the experience. Nothing happened this way, it's almost like the authors didn't give a sh**.
Also (and this is more personal as I am French) : the performance of Robert Pattinson, supposedly a French prince speaking English with a terrible accent, was unbearable to me... I mean, they could have easily found an authentic French actor with a terrible accent. Most French people do have terrible accents. But an American actor faking a French accent... such a weird idea - it simply doesn't work... (by the way: at that time, most English nobles and kings were mainly speaking French even at the court)."
81,"Without leaving any spoilers, let's just say that some recently search-trending actors names got this film to the top of your watch list.
The 'Dauphin' of France has one of the worst French accent I've come across on the planet and even Martians would be dubious over this characters origins. If you're a history 'fan', look the other way now.
Ultimately, let's take some critically acclaimed 'actors' from other genres and try mix them together with somber shots of politicians and aristocrats playing politics and artistorcrazy, in Medivet England and France, sprinkle some tracking battle shots for action and try get as many suckers to watch this crap as possible."
82,"I only watched it for the battlescene, which was woefully inaccurate compared to eye witness accounts and piecing together by battlefield detectives. The longbow, as a decisive weapon barely got a mention and barely featured. Watch YouTube instead. What a waste of time!!"
83,"Some reviews criticise the historical accuracy and literary origin of this film, but is it claiming to be a documentary or Shakespearean piece? No. So why fuss about that.
The script and acting is splendid. The way that Chalamet brings the character to life with an old-style English feels natural and true instead of a stiff play. The lighting and the battles also stood out to me. The darkness within the buildings of the time is not often shot so accurately. Nor is the clunky, exhasperating fighting with heavy armour and weapons. Usually battle scenes are made up of flashes, so that you can't pick it apart. It's nice to follow the main character throughout the scene and really see what's happening. Also great: fightscenes where main characters do not posess superhuman abilities.
Some found The King too long or tedious. I say it is nicely paced, doesn't feel rushed to get to the action-filled bits, but takes the time to develop its characters and politics.
Netflix pleasantly surprised me with this one, will watch it again."
84,This movie is just wrong. Terribly boring. Idiotic story with so many holes it could be a strainer. The main character looks like he could play in a rap video rather than be king.It is just a waste of time
85,"The producers should have stuck to a tried and tested formula...... the English are the bad guys.....always!
Watching this movie made me feel like I had been kidnapped and was developing Stockholm syndrome.....If you can see past this.... we'll then it's not a bad movie really but a little slow.The first battle/siege was shot from 3 fields away from the castle, I guess close ups of CGI castles and the explosions and fires cost a lot more money?
They march on but never really gets to any real peak but instead a very mediocre final battle...The accurate portrayal of the English as conniving and backstabbing (v little finger)
the mediocre battles scenes (v battle of the bast..ds) made me compare it to GOT and it came up short in story development and action."
86,"Shockingly boring, laboured acting because of horrendous dialogue. The only half decent aspect is Robert pattinsons french accent"
87,I'll take Shakespeare and Branagh's film was superior in all aspects. The filmography was more something one would expect in a Batman movie. Just not for me thank you.
88,Great telling of a medieval story. Great acting and pretty realistic generally I imagine. Very good fight scenes and gripping. Recommended
89,"The level of snobbery from so called ""historians"" that don't even realize this film is based on the Shakesperean play.. oh boy.It's a great film, some weak moments, many great moments and I only regret seeing it on a small screen. Timothée is a great Henry V and the cast is great.For those interested in a more profound Shakesperean adaptation, check out Kenneth Branagh's opus, Henry V. A better film but just as relevant."
90,"History is so full of amazing stories. How come cinema always has to completely stray from the historical facts !? To summarize my objections :(1) Way too much talk (or better yet : mumbling) and little fighting. And to make matters worse : a battle of Agincourt portrayed quite inaccurately.(2) Very one dimensional characters. King Henry is righteousness incarnate and the french crown prince is an arrogant, retarded homosexual.(3) Alternative deaths for historical characters such as Henry Percy and Thomas of Lancaster."
91,For Pete's sake stop throwing feminine looking men into masculine roles. In real life Timothy wouldn't be the leader of a Girl Scout Troop and the future Batman ( worst casting ever ) couldn't lift a real sword. These men ( supposedly ) are truly pathetic. I don't care if they're good actors. Cast them in transgender or gay movies where they'd easily fit in. I'd love to have seen this movie but it will be completely unwatchable with these two. Enough.
92,"The movie has such a good trailer as soon as I saw it I went to see the movie right away on Netflix. Henry V was one of the most intelligent and charismatic English kings and it changed the course of the 100 year's war.When you end up seeing the Battle of Agincourt like this, historically this is a good ""Palhaçada"". It's inaccurate from the beginning to the end. It represents the french dauphin, when he wasn't even on the battle and above all they represent him as a duchbag, when the French were the ones that followed the code of chivalry. The provocative approach was English, not french. There's a lot of things historically wrong with this movie and for me, that's a very important thing when you do a Historical movie like this. Like someone said on the comments, this movie to Shakespeare representation of Henry V, it's a difference from day to night. Try to watch this movie instead ""Shakespeare's Globe: Henry V"" and you'll get a good notion of who truly Henry V was."
93,"Ok so let me start by saying The King is beyond overhyped.
First off, the story is very simple and not too complex which is not bad, but the problem occurs whith its emptiness... Not well developed and definitely not interesting.The pace... Omg! So NOT for this film!!The acting is very mediocre and sometimes unbelievable and empty by Timothée chalamet who is a very decent actor (miss stevens), but unfortunately not in this film. I thought he was gonna fall asleep each time the camera is on him... And the accent... Just No!!Joel edgerton is really believable in this films without even trying.Robert Pattinson is also good, he was charismatic, fun and not too melodramatic like the rest.The cinematography and the visuals are very television and not cinematic enough.You can tell that the director was trying to do his best but unfortunately with a boring script and story like that, nothing can be Very well done."
94,"I confess I only managed an hour of this film.I was so bored and underwhelmed by the poor acting,sluggish pace and unremarkable writing and production that I simply couldn't take it anymore.I didn't like any of the characters either.A total waste of time and money imo."
95,"""The King"" is a long, boring but beautifully shot film that was rather disappointing to me. Honestly, I expected more going into a film that promises genuine character building in front of a medieval backdrop. The director clearly had great vision for this film but was unfortunately dragged down by a tedious and tiresome plot. Though I enjoyed Timothee Chalamet's performance as King Henry, he often seemed confused by his character's principles and motivations as the script insists of creating shocking, yet out of character moments, for him."
96,"""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" was on TCM the other night. I re-watched a little bit of it, and then I had this brilliant idea that I wanted to make a new adaptation of it, but I don't like any of Edward Albee's dialogue, so I'm going to dump it all and write my own. It's going to ROCK, and I don't see how I could possibly fail. It's not like Albee's dialogue had anything to do with the success of his play.If you're going to give us yet another screen adaptation of ""Henry V"" (because apparently neither the Laurence Olivier or Kenneth Branagh versions exist) but you're not going to use Shakespeare's actual text, then the least I feel I deserve is a ""Henry V"" that feels like it has some reason for existence -- i.e. relevance to our current times. But this film doesn't have that. It's just full of a lot of cliche ""it's hard out here for a king"" ideas about leadership, politics, and war that we've heard a million times in a million better movies. ""The King"" looks handsome, but its own sense of self-importance is so cumbersome that watching it is like slogging through the mud that mires the English and French warriors fighting it out in the film's climactic battle.The film is slow and ponderous and its solemn tone never varies. Timothee Chalamet (as Hal) seems bored to be in this film, and his performance has a curious lack of energy. The first time we see him in the movie he's sleeping, and it's like he never fully wakes up. I'm sure his bedroom eyes could make a tweener swoon, but my goodness someone give the boy a sandwich and a jolt of caffeine. My wife could body slam this dude, and she's about 5'4"" and 120#.Joel Edgerton, who wrote the screenplay, plays Falstaff, but his primary purpose for being in the movie is to look gross. The film wants us to think the relationship of Falstaff and Hal is critical to the plot's outcome, but it doesn't ever feel like more than a sketch. In fact, that applies to the whole movie. I saw one review that described this movie as being a bunch of plot developments on an outline that no one ever bothered to connect to one another with substance, and that's a pretty apt description of my own experience watching it.With about five minutes of screen time, Robert Pattinson shows up late in the film (because he's obligated to appear in literally every movie released in 2019) and tries his hardest to inject some life into it by way of a Monty Python French accent. It's like he listened to all of director David Michod's notes on how to play the character and then was like ""nah."" He makes fun of Hal's penis size before beheading a child and then slipping around in some mud, and appears to be having a blast doing it. I'm glad he had fun, because someone connected to this film deserved to.Grade: C+"
97,"I really enjoyed this film it's definitely one of the better films to come out this year.
There were a few things that bothered me, some scenes I found unbelievable. Some historians may get annoyed by some scenes where history is altered but it's still a really enjoyable film with great performances.
Timothee Chalamet is perfectly cast and does a great job in the lead role.
Definitely check this one out."
98,"Chalamet gets most of the nagative reviews, but the whole cast stinks. edgerton is no shakespeare. henry V and falstaff at agincourt. it's a silly movie, really. and the battle, which critics seem to like, is a muddle. literally."
99,"A fantastic, well cast, well acted, well shot, directed re-enactment of the battle of Agincourt and the burden and sacrifice a king must undertake. The timing, editing and score in this slice of British history is on point and truly provides substance and mood. The ghostly emptiness and loss of ones self is realised all to well by the lead, ""Timothée Hal Chalamet"". I was pleasantly surprised to see ""Joel Edgerton"" as trusty friend/advisor to Henry V. Both actors gave a fantastic performance.Hollywood, the old guard are right in seeing the demolition of what was once a stage to enchant people with true story telling. Pop corn movies have there place, but flooding the market with fantastical dross from all angles is stifling true story telling, dumbing down audiences, instead of embracing the real essence of film making, which is to be provocative, challenging educational and entertaining.Instead we leave the cinema knowing that Captain America can now weld Mjölnir!Roll on Netflix!!!"
100,"The dialogue is thorough and eloquent, conveying careful thought. Timothée Chalamet delivers another great performance, his every facial expression and tone of voice purposeful. I'm surprised by Robert Pattinson's ability to portray a french prince. The graphic parts are not superfluously gory. Well done."
101,"I never fully understood this when I was younger, but the saying is sort of telling us that everything is moving on. It's like saying after the game, is before the game. There is always a continuation, whether you or other persons are involved in that or not.And the same applies here. Timothee Chamolet is riding high (no pun intended) but he's not alone. The cast is amazing, the story gripping and there is enough to sustain your attention and be entertaining enough for the run time. For some if may have slower passages, but those are needed. Like a calm before the storm - also if you like medieval stuff and knights you don't even need me convincing you to watch this"
102,"A great movie which depicts the emotional and inglorious side of war. While war was a major theme of the movie, the storyline centers around skillful character development and not bloody fighting. The deep rich tones of the soundtrack are moving."
103,"Obvious, it is a special film. For different motifs, from the performances, suggesting a new generation of actors ready to propose great roles to the realism of fight scenes, from the politic and the grew up of a young prince becoming an admirable king to the expected John Falstaff. In meny senses, the film of Timothee Chalamet . And one of splendid works from Neflix. So, just a great film, a wise storytelling, beautiful performances, fair atmosphere and something escaping to definitions. A film about power, maybe out of expected Shakespeare but profound inspired portrait of the battle of Azincourt. So, just special, in all of senses, at each level."
104,"I rarely leave any review, not even for classics, but this movie touched me in many subtle ways. Good taste all around. The acting is superb, balanced, done with care, knwoledge and energy. Yes, it is grity as it is war and suffering.
It is obvious that the scenary is beautiful, picture perfect, as you expect from a world class movie from Netflix.
To say more is to spoil the experience for others. Enjoy a diamond, in today lack of original content."
105,"An impressive performance from Chalamet accompanied by an equally impressive Joel Edgerton makes for a fantastic story based around notions masculinity in the 15th century.A reserved king who does not want chaos, but reform and peace, is slowly coerced into a battle he does not want to take part in.Use of interesting but human camera movement, eerie sound design and ever so natural looking light immerses as much in battle scenes, as it does interior conversation scenes, summing up the mood and feeling of the time perfectly.An engaging watch and does not feel too long, even at 2 hours 15. 8/10"
106,A quietly powerful film that spoke with great volume. Perhaps escaping the recognition it deserved in the U.S it did receive 13 Academy nominations in Australia. It has the appeal of a historical drama not completely factual and not a lot of pomp and circumstance but a worthy watch!
107,"This is a master piece, that's how you can discibe it nothing less, great job netflix."
108,"It is extraordinarily perfect
I would like to see more this kind of productions on Netlfix more historical"
109,"The story of Henry V and the one the most impressive military victories in history, told with excellent performances by all, but most profoundly by the chemistry between Chalamet and Edgerton. Chalamet as Henry V is uncomfortable, uncertain, brooding, and intense the entire film. Edgerton as Falstaff, Henry's friend and drinking buddy turned military captain is hard and tough with quiet except when he knows what he needs to say. Pattinson is always a joy to watch and he is equally interesting as the French Dauphin, though we don't get to see him nearly enough.This is a story of uncertainty, disillusionment, deep anger, deception, war and power. A very well done film that leaves one feeling the pain of being deceived, manipulated, and unfulfilled even in victory. I felt taxed by its end as a good film can be. Well done Netflix!"
110,"It might be slow in some scenes, but the acting takes compensation, we have a nice and simple plot about a king no spoilers, and the main character takes everything in a new good acting level."
111,"Like many have said, one of the best things to have graced Netflix."
112,"One of Netflix's strongest titles. The work simply becomes reality and it is like being in the theater all the time and time flies. A stellar cast that plays its part in a credible and passionate way. Timothée, once again, confirms to be one of the most promising stars of the current decade and Michod has only done what was not done since the days of Ridley Scott's Gladiator."
113,"Moody, gritty, dark, subdued, pondered language, dark, excellently acted and characterised. The king himself truly traelled and grew into a war wearied cornered aggressor. The script, choreography, settings and casting was superb. TC WAS the King and the king knew himself to be surrounded by deceipt and manipulation."
114,"Firstly the film ticks lots of boxes- acting, costumes, direction all good with a decent budget.
But why another film which changes history for no actual reason. The story of Henry V needs no surgery. Without trying to sound like a history snob, Henry was 27 when he acceded the throne not 17. He had reconciled with his father. He had 3 younger brothers (born 1386,1387,1389 and 1390) and as such great material for the complex relationships of family loyalty and personal ambition. Thomas of Clarence, a suicidally brave soldier did not pre-decease his father but died in 1421 well after Agincourt. Henry Percy 'Hotspur' was over 20 years older than Henry and was not killed by him...the Dauphin did not die at Agincourt...Henry V was a seasoned warrior with the claim to the French throne ingrained in him. He was not a pacifist in any sense, that was his son Henry VI - and that is a whole other story...
Anyway off my high horse. A very watchable film for non history buffs!"
115,"You should know that this movie is based on historical events and Shakespeare's Play Henry V, with some changes and additions. The original play ended with the unison, but in the movie there was a (very enjoyable) twist to the end.
Henry V was one of the greatest warrior kings of medieval England, particularly known for the Battle of Agincourt.If you expect a highly accurate historical piece, don't watch it, maybe read a book about Henry V instead or watch a documentary.Brilliant acting, great visuals/costumes & cinematography - and overall stunning storytelling.Highly recommend watching it!"
116,"At last an opportunity to see Timothée Chalamet doing something a little grittier. Sadly, t'was not to be. His portrayal of this great character from early 15th Century British history left me cold. He looked like a good meal would have killed him, never mind a bloodthirsty foe clad in iron armed with an axe. The accent held up reasonably well, but he still struggles to shake off the winsome, ""butter wouldn't melt"" image and as he has to pretty much carry this film en seul, it just doesn't really work. The rare appearances by Robert Pattinson border on the hammy; with his final appearance reminding me of the first few steps taken by ""Bambi"" back in 1942. It is great that Netflix are prepared to fund projects like this, but the plain truth is that no amount of money can compensate for a poor screenplay - think Shakespeare ""light"" - supplemented with a few high-profile cameo contributions."
117,"The King possesses a few intriguing elements, but it just isn't as interesting or powerful as you'd expect. The result is a monotonous film that should've been exciting instead of dull. Setting and location production value was great, but the 140 min runtime was ridiculously and unnecessarily long, and felt even longer with the slow pacing. If this film was played at 1.5x speed, its shorter length and faster pacing would've made this film more entertaining. Many scenes were too long/dragged out. Director/writer David Michôd needed to make some serious edits and cuts to bring this film to a more ""suspenseful"" level (and length) of entertainment. Casting was excellent all around, especially Robert Pattinson who showed the most energy in his character, but I feel Timothée Chalamet was a poor choice for this role. It seemed like it was his first acting role with his stale, emotionless facial expressions and demeanor. A generous 6/10 from me."
118,"Probably one off the best movies off 2019, amazing soundtrack.."
119,Slow start but it was worth my time watching till the end.
120,"27 minutes in and I'm having to contend with absolutely bang average cinematography, a stale lead who cannot, one, nail an English accent if the head was the size of Timbuktu, and two, convincingly portray Shakespeare's young Prince Hal.
The overacting? My god, subtelty is dead in this one. Henry IV is given away as ill by a couple faux-coughs, Prince Thomas seems to be trapped in a permanent state of sing-song expression and even the almost-sex scene.Did I mention the costumes? Did Netflix even try to hide the fact that this is a pure and simple money grab?I'm not going to finish this flick. I recommend you don't either."
121,"People who rated this movie low because it was ""Historically Inaccurate ""are totally missing the point. This was a piece of theatre and the best work to come from Netflix for a long time.
If you want history there is plenty information with the touch of your Google button."
122,"I never did like 15th century movies but i loved this.... Timothée Chalamet portray of King Henry was flawless, production design was beautiful, the plot was wonderful...... I enjoyed watching this movie."
123,"A reasonably enjoyable drama, directly inspired by the post-GoT era. Its strength, frankly, is in its writing and dialogue. The viewer hasn't a choice but to hang on every word of Harris, Chalamet, Edgerton, and Pattinson. Pattinson brings value to every scene in which he participates. It mattes not whether his accent is accurate. The man is entertainment. The dialogue and character relationships are what makes it a drama rather than an action epic or historical narrative of any sort. The action sequences themselves are dim and imperceptible, as I'm sure the budget dictated, but not much was lost in checking out of those scenes. I would watch more movies like this. I was pleasantly surprised."
124,"This is one of the best movies i have ever seen.
From story, to acting, to mood, and realism.
I watched it once when it first came out, and now just rewatched it.
This movie is a 10 out of 10 for me, hands down.
The main actor deserves and award for his performance."
125,"I know nothing of the history of this so I'm just judging it as a movie. The best part of this was the unromantic/gritty fights. I don't know if I've seen this done before. They were muddy and people got tired very quickly. It was cool and added to the reality.Timothée Chalamet did a fantastic job. I've only seen him in a couple of things but he's been very good and I have my eye on him. I was surprised to see Joel Edgerton. He's one of my favorites. So much that I refer to him as ""The Edge.""The only thing that I didn't like was Sean Harris. He's a great actor and he did a great job but I was suspicious of him the whole time because he always plays the bad guy. And since this was about people betraying Hal I wondered why Harris wasn't questioned which made me assume he was up to something the whole time. Again, great actor just cast on the wrong part. I would have trusted The Edge in that role"
126,"I wasn't expecting this movie to be so gorgeously shot, and it really blew me away. I was assuming it'd look just like another one of the many period movies / series that have come along, but this was STUNNING. So crisp and deliberate. I was in awe the entire time."
127,I love the movie from beginning to the end. Gripping. The battle scenes are stunning. Superb acting overall from the cast. Though it feels long at times.
128,"The King is one of my favourite films from last year and I love this movie. The score is fantastic. I like the theme behind this film as well which is be careful who you surround yourself with and in this case, King Henry became like his father, he didn't intend to be like him but due to personal agendas and glory from members in his court, he was deceived into being a reflection of his father. The dialogue was superb and it's beautifully shot. Can't recommend it enough."
129,I really like the historical genre. Great acting by Timothy Chalamet. a wonderful Actor with soul and depth. In this movie I felt I was in the king's soul. The music is excellent with a combination of excellent frames we are in England on the way to war in France. Robert Pattinson is perfect as the French Dupont. He was crazy funny and mean and i loved it. i loved the story by David Michôd & Joel Edgerton the battle scene was precise from evey angle.
130,"Must say Timothée has astonishing performance, I think he invents a unique Henry 5, brave but calm, less impulsive when he is angry, always sentimental for friend, but cool on battle field.
The story line goes as expected after he takes throne, then followed by historical battle, victory, but the last past turns everything upside down, all the sublime purpose suddenly are clouded by ... King judgement or King desire ...
We fight the honor, as long as there is honor.."
131,"This film is well made, and has a fairly engaging story. However, I find the pace too slow, and the static shots compound to the stillness that slows the film down."
132,"Seriously, this is one of my favorite films of 2019, and I don't understand the lack of praise and love for this amazingly beautiful film. It's so amazing, from the quiet intimate conversations to the screaming bloody killing moments.
I love this movie and have watched it about a dozen times in the last year. I regret not viewing it in a theater...."
133,"The King is inspired by historical events and the works of Shakespeare. A lot of people say that its historically inaccurate and it misrepresents many historical facts.The thing that struck me while i was watching it was how quickly this movie rushes through the different stages of its story. This is a bit of a double edged sword, because it gives the movie a good tempo, but at the same time i felt like there is so much happening in such a little period of time. I think that it couldve made a great tv show if the writers wanted to really develop their plot and characters.Personal relationships play a great role in this movie and we are exposed to many acts of bravery, leadership and betrayal. We see the virtue of friendship and duty. There is a lot of cruelty as well.I didnt have any issues with the inspiration of the film and its choice to pick random events and to give them a spin fitting its trajectory. I really liked Pattinson in the role of the french prince and his accent didnt bother me at all. What i disliked though is how pathetic and unimportant the actual french king was. For a character of such importance, i think his presence felt incredibly marginal.The movie emphasizes a lot on how brave and honorable young Henry is and how he is ready to sacrifice himself in order to safe his men. Yet at the end we see that being young means being naive most of the time. Henry is questioning his decisions and is struggling to find meaning behind them.Its a great story of how growing up with more responsibilities than you can take can lead to unwise, spontaneous decisions. We find a lot of Shakespearean traits to the people surrounding the young king as they play their own personal games and pursue their own individual goals.The sets are great and the productions is wonderful. For the relatively small budget of $23 million the movies looks really convincing and the choreography of the battles is awesome. Im not sure if it was because of the budget or the length, but many important ceremonies and meetings were shortened and felt a bit rushed.Overall a great medieval tale of kings and battles, but if youre looking for historical accuracy its probably not for you."
134,"The film is about the rise of King Henry V. However, the Battle of Agincourt is so important in the planning and tactics. It down plays the use of the war bow, and the archers themselves. Other than that, the film was amazing. Portrays the incarnate power of Henry V, and his ability to get the facts to see through those within his inner circle."
135,"Being a fan of historical drama, this film was perfection from casting, music score, cinematography and direction. What makes this film exceptional is the attention to detail from the patience required for going to war, the weight and discomfort of armor, the messiness of battle...it is just so well thought out.
Chalamet especially made this film exceptional for me.
Having watched many questionable historical films, I delayed watching this. Silly error...I have watched this many times since and continue to find more interesting details.
You will not regret watching this. So get comfortable, make sure no one disturbs you and enjoy!"
136,"I thought it was a show when I was browsing the Netflix thumbnails, so I clicked on it and found out it was a movie. But man I wished now it should have been a show just to keep the satisfaction for years to come. a wonderful film that has grit, amazing sequences, Robert Pat was hilarious and great! Timothee was superb and I am now a fan of what he can bring on stage! can't wait for ""Dune"" great actors and great Director!"
137,"...because may expectations were low and I thought it will just be an entertaining movie but without nothing to say about, I guess I was wrong. Timothée over exceed my expectations at playing young king Henry and made a remarkable job. There were two things that I completely loved about this movie, the first were the battle scenes, they are probably the most realistic battle scenes in this historic time I've ever seen in a movie, all the other shows battles with armors and horses like the knights and soldiers were ninjas with swords that moved very easily even though the weight of the armor and that controlled the sword and everything on the battlefield with perfection but this movie doesn't do that, this shows what the battles really looked like: a total mess! The other thing that I loved is that they didn't tried to romantize the Henry wedding with the French princess with some love at first sight thing like a lot of movies do about arranged weddings in this period.The direction was also pretty decent and that final plot twist was good and completely unexpected. Despite all of these good points the movie is historically inaccurate and also inaccurate in comparison with Shakespeare's plays that were the base for this movie. This can be a bad point if you care about history and facts but if you only want to have a good time watching a good movie this won't matter.
This is probably one of the best Netflix movies!"
138,"This 15th century court and battlefield drama, oozing Shakespearean influence, is not entirely devoid of simple funny dialogue. Early in the story, receiving words from his half-delirious father King Henry IV (Ben Mendelsohn) asking him to come home, Prince Hal (Timothee Chalamet) bluntly tells the messenger that his father's requests will be ignored. When the messenger stresses that the request is urgent, Hal, walking briskly away and without breaking stride, shouts back ""The urgency is also ignored"".Another example. During Hal, now King Henry V lays siege on a French castle. One advisor comments that it is not advisable doing nothing and just waiting for the enemy's provisions to run out. Another advisor answers for the King ""This is the definition of a siege!"" But alas, such simple levity is few and far between.The main thrust of the plot is straightforward. As a juvenile delinquent of a prince, Hal is forced to face his newfound responsibilities upon the death of his father. Moreover, unlike KHIV, a reckless warmonger, KHV is a pacifist. Failed efforts to seek compromise ends in the fabled Battle of Agincourt where, against overwhelming odds, Hal defeats the army of the French Prince The Dauphin (Robert Pattinson), who, incidentally is just as delirious as his father KHIV.The above is an over-simplification of the movie which offers interesting subplots, anecdotes and characters. But first to my headline. While Chalamet enjoys his meaty lead role, Pattinson in his brief but scene-stealing role is the funniest as you have ever seen him, exaggerated French accent and all. In what ought to be a climactic duel between the two heartthrobs (half a generation apart?), we see The Dauphin, approaching Hal menacingly with raised sword, slips in the wet mud and stumbles under the weight of his full armour before he can deal a single blow. The sight is so pathetic that Hal sees no point in engaging him, but just orders his soldiers to finish him off.While there is a sizable support male characters including Joel Edgerton playing Hals' best friend John Falstaff who engineers the victory of the Battle, there are two female supports, both with very limited screen time but both turned in impressive performances.Thomasin McKenzie is Queen Philippa of Denmark, Hal's sister, warns him against people he believes that he can trust. Lily Rose-Depp plays Catherine de Valois the French princess that her defeated father offers to Hal in marriage. Anything but a damsel in distress, she is the one that makes him pay attention and try to grow up.The cinematography is too dark for my liking. Background music throughout comes from a string ensemble that leans heavily on the lower-registered instruments."
139,"Brilliant, well-paced supremely-acted bopic of the young Henry V. Slow-paced but in a good, thoughtful way, with a great and haunting score, and the Battle of Agincourt was realistically portrayed. Took me a few minutes to recognize Joel Edgerton as he was middle-aged, portly and with a brilliant Lancashire accent. However, undoubtedly, Timothee Chalamet dominates this movie with a tour de force performance. What a screen presence for someone so young, especially when he isn't speaking. I have no doubt he is going to be huge, the next Leonardo DiCaprio I suspect."
140,"The storyline, I can't say if it's true or not. I know nothing at all about English history, let alone Henry the 5th. Parts seem exaggerated or at least approached with artistic freedom. The political intrigues did not come over as realistic to me at least, the twists and turns were amateuristic and no king would fall for such a lame attempt at anyone undermining his power.However, the movie's greatest asset is not in its narrative (even though its it's a good story), but in the gruesome fight scene(s). It's bloody, its dirty and it's close and personal as any real battle would have been back then. It's a very uncomfortable watch to be honest, but I was still glued to my seat.I won't spoil too much, but even the death scenes are presented in a realistic way. People don't just drop to the floor, you actually see the life leaving their body. This is not something you would typically see in any R rated movie, not even Dredd, Punisher or Deadpool show it in this fashion.One of the best Netflix movies out there."
141,"I kind of loved this movie. Very well produced. The musical score throughout was great. From the first panning shot on the battlefield with the setting sun I was hooked. And I don't understand all the complaining about historical inaccuracies. Isn't one of the characters completely based on a character from Shakespeare?
It is over dramatic at times. The one instance that stands out is when Chalamet is arguing with an advisor and there's all this hair in Chalamets face for dramatic affect. Ohhhk get over yourself. There are other instances as well. Also, Chalamet is a good actor but doesn't ever quite pull off being a king.
I thought the script was almost perfect but too modern at times which made no sense. Dropping the f word and some other phrases that were just out of place. Robert Pattinson was a great surprise. Pretty hilarious with his French accent but it worked.
I did not like the script writers character, Falstaff. He was trying too hard. It was like he was trying to be Russell Crowe from gladiator, dropping his voice as low as possible.
But I swear I really did enjoy this movie. The production value is fantastic. I just wish I could see a movie like this in a theater!"
142,"The King is one of that movies which starts very slowly and picks up pace very fastly towards the end. The King is a well made character study. Timothee Chalamet gave a decent enough performance as King Henry V. Joel Edgerton was really good and his character is very likeable. The King gives some really good scenes which stays in our mind. Robert Pattinson is unforgettable in this movie and he has done so well in this small role. The war scenes are captured well and I really liked it. The background music is also very good which suits the overall tone of the movie and gives us that historical feeling. Overall, The King is a good movie and everyone who likes slow paced movies can definitely watch this."
143,"Prettt decent movie. It took the important parts of King Henry and put then together. Through these moments, there was room for conversations with alot of silence in between. In the beginning there was a not-caring teenager that despised his father. He eventually grew up to a king that won a desiding battle in France. Ending with a question of his future wife asking why he wanted to go to war, what is all was for.It could have been the translation of some chapters straight out of a book or from a documentary. But combining it into a movie makes it all that better."
144,Not historically as accurate as I would have liked but an excellent effort all the same. Got my juices flowing and that is the object surely. The lead was believable and thankfully not a musclebound Hollywood drone.
145,"Absolute masterpiece..a tour de force..Timother Chalamet is breathtaking..Edgerton, amazing. Robert Pattison stole the show.. QA"
146,"New take on famous story: every possible historical fact is wrong, and medieval king is emo kid with sad eyes. He suffers all the time, mostly because he wants peace, and peace is impossible at the time. But he is really pretty, and when he doesn't suffer he is great in fights, so I think most women will like this movie.. For me, it was sometimes too slow, like many others I'm not a fan of totally changing the original story, but the acting was good, the atmosphere was great (and this is mostly atmospheric movie peace), and it's still far better aproach than those silly action adaptation like the newest Robin Hood."
147,A good story and a great battle scene. All very realistic with a good line up and great acting. I really enjoyed this film and definitely up there in the top 5 medieval offerings.
148,I enjoyed this movie because of the performances and the cinematography. It is not historically accurate and I wish it would have been. The main battle scene was wonderfully done. I enjoyed it overall and it is well worth two hours of one's time.
149,"Right now I'm half way through The King and I've paused to give my thoughts so far. The word that keeps coming to mind is superb. Superb script, superb acting, superb photography.Young Hal, the reluctant new king Henry V, Just wants peace - an end to all the civil strife. But the best way to bring England together turns out to be war - a war against France. Well, the French are literally asking for it.The film itself is beautiful, raw, thoughtful, impressive. There are many words and images to savour. The grim medieval realism is reminiscent of (bizarrely) Monty Python & the Holy Grail. But the tension and conflict brings to mind the best Game of Thrones episodes, like Battle of the Bastards.So far: this one's a keeper."
150,I was extremely impressed by how grounded and yet how full of expression this movie was-it had no fluff or filler-but was still fascinating and visually satisfying. Acting was solid and the music and cinematography was beautiful! Definitely worth a watch.
151,"Loosely based on Shakespeare's ""Henry IV: Parts 1 & 2,"" and ""Henry V,"" David Michôd's (""Animal Kingdom"") epic medieval drama The King lacks the Bard's poetry and soaring eloquence, yet its intensity, intimacy, and brooding power will keep you captivated throughout its 133-minute run time. Co-written by Michôd and Joel Edgerton (""Boy Erased""), the film is marked by the convincing performance of Timothée Chalamet (""Beautiful Boy"") as Prince Hal, later King Henry V, whose growth from a rebellious and ""uncourtly"" teenager into a king who commands respect and even fear is astonishing. Though the film departs from the Shakespeare play and the historical record, it is easily the equal of the ""Henry V"" films of Laurence Olivier and Kenneth Branagh in its ability to probe the depths of the royal mind.The King opens in court. Hal's rage against his father King Henry IV's (Ben Mendelsohn, ""Robin Hood"") obsession with internal wars in Scotland and Wales has caused him to leave the royal court and associate with John Falstaff (Edgerton) and his friends in the Eastcheap tavern. Unlike the cartoonish buffoon of Shakespeare's play, however, Falstaff is the king's trusted adviser and honest friend as well as a man of reason and deep military experience, serving to later remind the king of the ideals he espoused as Prince Hal. Though Hal's defeat of Henry Percy (Hotspur) (Tom Glynn-Carney, ""Tolkien"") in a sword fight saves his father's throne, his worthiness to become king is questioned by the dying King Henry IV who anoints Hal's younger brother Thomas of Lancaster (Dean-Charles Chapman, ""The Commuter"") as his successor.In the opening scene of the Shakespeare play ""Henry V,"" the Archbishop of Canterbury says ""The breath no sooner left his father's body, But that his wildness, mortified in him, Seem'd to die too."" When his father dies and Thomas is killed in Wales, Hal becomes King Henry V. As if the title brings with it a mythical power, Henry is transformed into a philosopher-king, more than ready to prove his right to rule. Determined to avoid patriotic wars, the new king ironically finds himself immediately embroiled in one. After an alleged assassination attempt and an insult by the Dauphin of France (Robert Pattinson, ""High Life""), Henry is ready to go to war with France.In the stirring epic battle at Agincourt in October 1415, immortalized by Shakespeare, the English soldiers are heavily outnumbered by the French led by the cocky Dauphin who taunts the monarch in a dubious French accent by saying, ""I enjoy to speak English. It is simple and ugly."" King Henry, however, relies on Falstaff's masterful military mind to win the battle against overwhelming odds, turning the conflict in his favor by use of his long-bowmen. Empowered by the cinematography of Adam Arkapaw (""The Light Between Oceans""), the costumes by Jane Petrie (""Suffragette""), and the relentless score by Nicholas Britell (""If Beale Street Could Talk""), the horrors of war are conveyed with graphic authenticity.Considered by some modern critics as a reckless warmonger, in Michôd's vision Henry V is the personification of England's triumph over internal dissension and foreign threats. The film, however, does not glorify war or turn it into poetry to inspire the troops. Here there is no battle of Harfleur with the stirring exhortation, ""Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more; Or close the wall up with our English dead,"" nor do we see the young king wearing a disguise to survey the troops opinions about whether or not the king's goals are justified.What we do see is Henry not only winning the battle but gaining the hand of French King Charles VI's daughter Princess Catherine of Valois (Lily-Rose Depp, ""Planetarium""). The outspoken princess boldly tells the English king that ""All monarchy is illegitimate"" and causes Henry to question his rationale for starting the war. In spite of England's success on the battlefield, however, Henry is an ambiguous figure whose manner of wielding power has raised questions as to whether he was a ruthless oppressor or a great liberator.Though it was within the rules of war in the fifteenth century, not a second thought seems to have been given to the order to put prisoners' heads on spikes, or to murder hundreds of French prisoners ostensibly because a number of English page boys were killed. Whatever our ultimate view of the character of Henry V is, it need not deter us from appreciating The King, a remarkable achievement and a big winner for Netflix."
152,"I read a review which said the lead struggled to fill the role he was playing, but that's the point, anyone in that position would be overwhelmed. It felt completely genuine to me. The final battle scene was great and truely highlights the advantage the winning side had. I've watched it 10 times since it's release, instant classic."
153,Wow Netflix does it again ! This was so well done in every aspect of this film ! Loved it
154,I have to watch the final scenes every week or so. The acting is too good.
155,"The acting, costuming, editing, cinematography and set pieces of this film are really a joy and have been some of the best seen out of Netflix. The story should contain a ""based on"" disclaimer and not be labeled a biopic. A history this is not and you will notice a quick deviation from Shakespeare as well. If you know this going in, it is very much worth a watch."
156,"It is baffling to me that this film is receiving so much legitimate rancor for being historically inaccurate. I would think that anyone with a functioning brain would realize that this is narrative cinema and not a documentary feature film. If you want to learn the true history, take advantage of the existence of the totally real and separate genre of documentaries. It's utterly ridiculous that these stuck-up know-it-all amateur ""historians"" think that the director/script writer/etc. didn't do any research. The wikipedia page for the Battle of Agincourt or even King Henry V will give an accurate account of events; it's not exactly valuable, hidden knowledge that they seem to bandy it as being. I don't see anyone dumping on Shakespeare for writing a dramatization. The fact is, this is a story about The King, and this holier than thou contrarianism has no place in judging this film.To start, it's a great Netflix movie. In the vein of Outlaw King, the film does a good job of immersing the viewer in the setting. The acting was solid all around, and the musical score, while not particularly memorable, had its moments. The set pieces are good, and the props are even better. True armor-buffs will no doubt have something to say about the historical accuracy of the costuming, but the performance put on by the actors in these seemingly real sets of armor was very convincing. Above all, this movie gave us something that other media has repeatedly failed to give us: convincing armored combat. Gone are the wild swings of longswords somehow cleaving through a breastplate. Instead we finally get the good old grappling and knife fighting skills that proved to be so useful on the battlefield. The fights were a joy to watch for this reason. As for the plot; it's solid. Some moments approached melodrama, but all good stories should be a little over the top, or they wouldn't be worth telling.It may not be a true to life version of events surrounding Agincourt and Henry V, but the history is interesting to study, but not necessarily fun to tell your mates about. What we got here was a good story."
157,"This film is essentially an amateur reenactment, with the inevitable Netflix filter applied in editing for that 90s look .Script, camera, lighting, editing and directing are dreadfully formulaic, as usual .One extra star for costumes and sets, it's the one thing they spend money on .
Unfortunately, that's the only effort made in this and any other Netflix productions ."
158,"Really incredible, emotional, and well acted movie. Just accept it for what it is, and you'll be okay."
159,"Incredible, riveting. King Henrys battle scene done in one camera shot was mind blowing! So well acted too. I'm hyped after watching such a good movie on Netflix, not used to it 😅"
160,Amazing and haunting. Great acting and it All seemed New and fresh even though the story and history has Been told before
161,"Who gives a damn about ""historically accurate"" this movie was great. Good acting Good story Good action scene."
162,"The king delivers another great film to Netflix's list of exclusives, the topics covered throughout the film like, man's need for war has a profound effect. Chalamet delivers an excellent performance which is now to be expected. The acting is the strongest asset to the film with Joel Edgerton and Robert Pattinson both adding weight to their characters. The score is fantastic as well as the cinematography capturing some well crafted battle scenes as well as the politics behind war which are all fantastic to watch.The only gripe I have with the film is it is somewhat committed to the Shakespearean language,but not entirely as it keeps swaying back and forth between regular English and Shakespearean English. Also some audiences might find the film to be quite slow at points, however I believed the battles needed this build up and politics to further heighten the reasons both these countries are at war.Overall I had a great time watching the king, Timothee Chalamet is one of the best actors today and it shows in this film. With a great supporting cast backing him up, direction which is passionate about the subject and a story that is extremely intriguing and exciting. Definitely a film you should consider watching."
163,"How does such a ridiculous excremental childish script and story ever get produced? Thousands of talented people put in time..the actors, the camera crew , the costumers, and set dressers and all the other people involved in the collaborative art that is film did their jobs really well. Real money was spent on the production.. but the story and script ..oh god... why? why? would anyone fund such a pro-nationalist flag waving 'us good and peaceful enemy evil and ludicrous' idiot piece of propaganda? was it made for children? It reminds me of the worst of 1950s cold war ""Combat with Vick Morrow"" type tripe. The utterly transparent and crass way they try to yank on heartstrings like a yoke would have been insulting enough.At WORST they could have at least cribbed the best parts of Shakespear..someone needs to do a 2 hour 'Henry IV pts 1 and 2+ Henry V' sometime..but no, the skipped that....OR they could have gone past Holingsheds chronicles for an accurate and gritty portrayal of the court and the battle....but literally any choice they made was to go as far opposite of historical record they could manage.OR they could have made a lighter hearted redemption of the Falstaff character..with him at the center and from his point of view...instead..what a criminal waste of so many peoples time and talent on ..yes indeed the WORST possible retelling of any of this. And this is up for awards? how ? how in the name of anything could this have been nominated for anything but the bottom of a trash can in the editing bay?"
164,"The writing is splendorous!
It was also very well planned and executed. A lot of smal scenes, takes and camera motion that portrayed a certain concept/idea/message.
This was a beautiful peace of art that I urge everyone one to watch.
This is not just another history film, this is a true work of art."
165,"I think this movie is very good because I like the atmosphere of the dark European Middle Ages. ""The King"" provides it."
166,"The biggest problem with this movie is that it doesn't know what it wants to be. On the one hand, it tries to take a fresh look at the person of King Henry V, but ta the same time, it tries to be an adaptation of Shakespeare's play. As a result it false at both, lacking the flair and drama of the play, while at the same time managing to be LESS historically accurate than Shakespeare's work. E.g. It shows the Battle of Shrewsbury as being settled with a single duel. (The 5000 or so casualties of the battle would be surprised to hear that!) It states that Henry's brother Thomas dies in Wales before Henry's coronation (The real Thomas, duke of Clarenc, lived another 20 years and died in France.) It claims that Sir John Falstaff led the vanguard at Agincourt. (The person Falstaff was based on was already dead by then and the vanguard was led by the Duke of York.) And, finally, it claims that the Dauphin (Played by Pattinson and arguably the only watchable part of the movie)was killed at Agincourt, whereas in reality he never went anywhere near the battle.
None of this was necessary.
So, lacking even the pretense of historical accuracy, does the film at least present an engaging story? Not at all. It presents us with a moping, emo, Prince Hal turned King Henry V (I swear Chamelet's expression doesn't change even once during the entire movie), who lacks the determination and dynamic personality of Shakespeare's eponymous character. For two thirds of the movie, the audience watches as this charisma-challenged individual stumbles around in a mental fog and allows himself to be pushed around by events leading up to the climactic battle, where, instead of actually taking charge, he has to learn basic tactics from other people. Then, to top it all off, we are treated to the meeting between King Henry and Princess Katherine of France. Whereas Shakespeare used this final scene as release tension by showing the two protagonists in an comically awkward courtship, hampered by language and cultural difficulties, the makers of 'The King' use it to show the world how WOKE they are. Within seconds, Princess Katherine, the only meaningful female character in the movie, unravels the conspiracy, analyses Henry's character and generally demonstrates the infinite superiority of the female mind over the poor befuddled males. I have some advice for you: If the only way you can write a strong female character is by making all men look dumb, I suggest you find another job. This does not show social awareness, it shows a lack of writing skill.
So, where does this leave us? If you want to learn about the real King Henry V, this movie is useless, because it lacks even a veneer of historical truth. If you want to be entertained, I strongly recommend watching the 1989 movie starring Kenneth Brannagh. I gave The King more than one star, simply because I liked Pattinson as the Dauphin but his role is too small to make the movie watchable."
167,"Man that was great, I watched it twice. The actors did an amazing job. Good job on this one Netflix."
168,"I love history and was initially disappointed with how historically inaccurate this movie is right off the bat. Henry is portrayed as a young pacifist when in reality he was anything but that. Nonetheless, it turned out to be a really well done medieval movie. I ended up really enjoying this movie and was pleasantly surprised!"
169,"The King is getting compared to last year's 'The Outlaw King' quite a bit. Released on Netflix, period piece 'epic' war film, reluctant hero, etc. While certainly a fair comparison on the outskirts, I think The King deserves to be praised on its own merits, though both films are quite good. With a much slower burn, The King is a film largely about trying to fix the sins & mistakes of the previous reign/generation so that peace can be brought to the world, and it succeeds on almost every level at telling the story in that way. I was worried about Chalamet and Pattinson's accents, with only the latter feeling a tad off. But overall, this cast is magnificent, both leading men are surrounded by an incredibly talented character actor based group who know exactly what is needed of them to tell the story (or at least the beginning) of Henry V. Joel Edgerton absolutely steals this film from the get-go, and the final 15 minutes contain just enough surprises for the casual viewer. Loved this one.8.7/10"
170,"As a stand alone movie about a King in medieval times, this was an ok movie. As a portrayal of Henry V it was lacking. The sound sample of the full plate in the battle scenes made me think plate armour was made of slightly stiffened tin foil. The locations looked lovely and much attention was paid to try and achieve an authentic feel. This movie was let down by the dialogue which at times passed as authentic and other times did not. The plot featured historical events but they were creative with how they shared them with their audience. Overall a good try but I wish it had been better."
171,"It's so very rare a movie can combine so many things, and so beautifully that it can almost leave your expectations as but fugitives to the gift you are witnessing before you. Whatever Netflix is inspiring in creative 'morale' alone is a pioneering effort. It has, in effect, raised the bar of movie making to a wondrous new level of creativity. Whether the genera here might interest you or not, the inherent talent involved in the final product of many of their films is simply breathtaking in the extreme. Somehow, Netflix has has been able to imagine, conceive, and execute many of the best films in just a few short years that even Hollywood hasn't been able to do in the last 30, and likely more. Constant re-makes of Hollywood films barely 20 years old do indeed tell that tale. As an artist, when you come from the GUT in your vision of exactly how it should be, and someone actually listens to you, and believes in your vision on a GUT level, then you often have such genius as this coming forth that damn near puts everything else to shame. Many Netflix films are simply beyond Oscar worthy. Mainly because the old guard of 'Standards' doesn't like the 'New Kid' walking right in, and doing everything exactly as most everyone watching wants it to be."
172,"The King is a beautiful movie, and the story of King Henry V is great history. You couldn't ask for a better story and this movie does it justice.Excellent cast (Chalamet, all grown up! Lily-Rose Depp, all grown up!), particularly the movie's writer and producer, Joel Edgerton, as Falstaff. Falstaff is not a historical character but a composition of several historical characters. (Yeah, he's Shakespeare's recurring favorite, along with his goat as incarnated in Henry VI's John Falstolf, who WAS a historical character). Everyone was just great, including Robert Pattinson as the doofus Dauphin. And Sean Harris, who is never not great.This isn't Henry's entire life story, just the highlights. Loved it."
173,"This Netflix-produced movie is a standout with brilliant casting of Timothee Chalamet as Henry V and Joel Edgerton is superb as well.The screenplay, writing, historical accuracy and violence of battle make the movie a treat to watch; but Chalamet's portrayal of a young Henry V is definitely what makes this film. Even the slow parts and dialogue show his natural acting talent and depth if character. He brings passion to the role as well as vulnerability and as people already know, he is one to watch for big things in the future, already having established himself as a household name in Hollywood at such a young age.The film mixes betrayal, friendship, political and emotional connections very well, and pieces it together in an aesthetically pleasing film. Watch it, it's long, and you'll probably learn something about history you never knew. You may not rate it as highly, but you'll be the better off for seeing it."
174,"A very different take on the story of King Henry V from the one we're used to seeing; you know the one a certain Mr Shakspeare has served up. As might be expected from a director who as already given us ""Animal Kingdom"" and ""The Rover"" there's a whiff of the gangster to be found here. These are the courts not of the high born but of the common, men who have fought their way to the throne through muddy fields of blood while Michod's vision of medieval Europe seems wholly accurate without being overdone.Of course, this is a Henry far removed from the nobility of an Olivier or a Branagh. Chalamet's Henry is certainly noble but he's also much more of a pragmatist, prepared to think first and act later, unlike Robert Pattinson's over-the-top and somewhat camp Dauphin; the contrast between them is beautifully delivered. The other main character is, naturally, Falstaff who, in Joel Edgerton's superb performance, is a much more subdued presence than we have seen before. Indeed the acting throughout is outstanding as is the screenplay co-written by Michod and Edgerton, while the Battle of Agincourt is as fierce and as bloody as any battle ever put on film. In an age of Marvel movies ""The King"" might seem like a fish out of water but it's unquestionably one of the best films of the year."
175,"I would say this is the best Netflix movie ever made !
The acting and the writing are Oscar worthy !A new telling of King Henry the V , with an awesome script and fantastic actors . This movie
Is great . Watch it now!"
176,"Loved so much about this, and it's great to be pleasantly surprised. Good amount of grittiness too."
177,"Don't know how historically l accurate it is, that a side.
Well scripted and executed."
178,"I'm glad I did check this out, because this film is certainly a step up from some of the Netflix releases I've seen from last year. To a point, I understand most of the middling reviews for this film. It's not perfect, far from it: it's a bit too long; Timothee Chalamet acts circles around everyone else on screen; and I will admit that some of the scenes in the first half of the film that feature Falstaff away from Hal are rather unnecessary. Some of the writing, too, feels a bit over-earnest, and at times a bit cheesy, but there are other moments where the writing soars (Chalamet's speech before the final battle). This film teetered on a 3.5/5 and 4/5 star rating the whole time I was writing my review, and I decided to give it a 4/5 star. There are issues with this film; I wont pretend there aren't. But this film also shows a lot of improvement over some of the direct-to-Netflix releases I've seen recently. I would much rather have films like this, that fall make a vie for greatness and fall just shy, than I would have a dozen more middling, soulless, committee-written-and-approved Marvel movies. This film might not be the one of the great medieval epics that will be remembered for years, but it's a step in the right direction for a company who has, at best, only put out decent movies so far."
179,"What a tedious movie. Terribly miscast, incomprehnsible dialog, often too dimly lit. Chalamet is too slender to be the heroic warrior king. So many other actors would have been better. In fact Rob and him should have changed places. Robert Pattinson is totally laughable as the buffoon like Dauphin would have made a better Henry and Chalamet as the Dauphin. The dialog is often incomrehensible. Why fake such heavy accents? Bad casting.
The story is hard to follow unless you are familiar with the plays. Bad writer. Very modern expletives. The characters are had to differentiate. Bad director. The lighting is pitch dark or close to some scenes. Can't make out what is going on.
The muddy battle isn't exciting because can't tell who is who.
Lily Rose Depp as the queen is out of place with her exotic looks.
Give this mess a miss."
180,I gave it 6/10. 5 of that was for the set designers and builders and the costume crew. Chalamet just didn't earn his selection for the part.
181,"Slow and boring tale about a made up king. Mare up, because historically this tale never happened the way it is told here. So it's a mare up story that usually is more fun than the real thing, right? Wrong! What a drag this is."
182,This was the best Netflix original move I have seen Robert Pattinson was really good in this movie even if he doesn't have too much screen time he makes the best of what is given to him storytelling wise the movie had a good story the guy playing Hal was really good the only problem I had with this movie felt a bit raw and unfinished and if the story was turned into a miniseries it would pan out a bit better than the movie
183,"Grit, history, humour, song. So much to say about this gem but I won't waste your time with a precis, JUST WATCH IT. (kids not invited)"
184,"Perfect cinematography, visual effects on a cinematic scale. Performances that are emotionally engaging, the sheer beauty of it. This does not play like a Netflix movie, more like a blockbuster epic.
I always engage with Falstaff in Henry V, and find the actors who portray him fascinating, and Joel Edgerton does not disappoint, this is one of his career standouts, easily his best since Warrior.
Timothée Chalamet is scintillating as Hal, who goes from wayward prince to King of England in a journey that is filled with anguish, blood and grief.
Netflix's best movie to date! Who cares if it's not accurate to the source material or history!"
185,"Don't worry too much about the inaccurate dates and events.
just enjoy the film and read up after about the true events.
let the film inspire you to read great English history!"
186,"Whoever was involved in the making of HBO's ""Catherine"" should watch this movie. This is what Catherine should have been like, not the farce in which Helen Mirren's considerable talents were wasted."
187,"The King is a suitably dark and gritty adaptation of Shakespeare's Henriad play's, Henry IV Parts 1 and 2 and Henry V. Avoiding the warlike triumphalism of some of the previous adaptations, King Henry V is portrayed here as a reluctant monarch and quiet pacifist forced into a war he doesn't want. The film is probably more accurate to actual history than the sanitised version presented in Shakespeare's plays. The battle scenes are bloody, brutal and dirty. The key battle of Agincourt is presented as a muddy quagmire of hand to hand combat rather than the heroic battle of legend. The film shows the brutal reality of medieval warfare and ultimately its futility.Timothee Chalamet as Henry V and Joel Edgerton as Falstaff both put in strong performances while there are good cameos from Robert Pattinson, Ben Mendelssohn and Lily-Rose Depp. And the film is visually impressive.The one downside are the accents. French-American actor Timothee Chalamet struggles with the English accent while English actor Robert Pattinson makes a laughable attempt at a French accent in playing The Dauphin. One can't help but wonder if they might have been better off switching roles."
188,"The only thing i didn't like about this movie is when it was over. The costumes, cinematography, score and the story and acting by all but especially timothee chalamet!"
189,"Wow, I'm really surprised that Netflix put out a movie THIS good. The lead actors acting was superb. Can highly recommend this movie."
190,"Having seeing some of the first and last movie productions from this new giant of entertainment i was getting a bit squeptical about it, if would at some point be any original movie that stake at the audiencie spectatives of what a real and well product that will do it.
Well, for that matter The King stands really well from its own across his 2 hours and 20 minutes long.
An excellent screenwriting in my opinión, gets elevated from the simple of the argument to the highest thanks to the actors and actress performance.
The photography and customs are on point and the sound i found it considerably outstanding.
There are some hints of battle scenes that reminded me of Game of Thrones, and they were pretty good executed.
I liked the last twist at the final scenes. I thought of them like the final steps for the new king completed his circle."
191,"This movie has surpassed my expectations. Everything about this movie was a thrilling experience! However, I could find some small flaws that keep me from rating this movie 10/10. Still an almost perfect movie!"
192,"The film is fantastic, if only Patisson wasn't in it, that would be great. The man is an awful actor, very bad choice from the casting stuff on an otherwise solid and entertaining film. Almost 2 and a half hours literally fly because of the film's substance and entertainment value. Solid 8 out of 10 for me."
193,"Was not expecting a lot but WOW. Acting was great, story was done well and all around one the best Netflix wrapped its claws around. Props to Timothee, Joel and Sam for being exceptional. I flinched when I saw the length of this movie...but it did not feel that long at all. Finally a good film that doesn't leave you feeling like they shaved off most of the quality and leaving you feeling cheated like Catherine the Great, worth the watch"
194,"I love historical epics like this and I think there aren't enough out there with this quality and accuracy I loved the gritty realistic fighting and the amazing script and acting and just the general atmosphere and feeling and to find out that brad Pitt produced it as well is pretty cool I enjoyed Netflix's release last year of outlaw king and I think this movie surpasses it in so many ways, I was never bored and every scene felt like it mattered the movie flowed nicely and although it's two and a half hours it didn't feel like it! If this movie is released on blu ray I'll definitely buy it an amazing work of cinema as well as an awesome historical epic. These are the movies Netflix should make more of! When done right these historical epics are Oscar worthy!"
195,"A brilliantly made film that is based upon on of England's greatest. The acting is impeccable. A true gem of a movie that only comes along once in a while.
Take the time to absorb each scene as the movement is beyond expectations."
196,"If you enjoy a good historical drama with plenty of blood and guts, this is pretty good. Netflix again produces a movie to satisfy a hole in the traditional formula driven churn.Well acted and well produced, it left me wanting more. Hopefully they pop out a couple more of these, the stories are half written by history, they just need to present it in a professional and entertaining manner, as with this one."
197,"What's the point? It's as inaccurate historically as Shakespeare's play, and the writing is so much worse. Slow, dull, darkly lit, badly written. And, to make matters worse, a waste of Timothee Chalamet, who is too young for Hal and not really believable as a military leader. I gave it some stars because it is watchable (I would watch Chalamet read the phone book for two hours). And it's a real achievement to make the bowl cut sexy."
198,"At the beginning of this film, I thought, oh no, a high school emo film *cringe*
However, from the point where Hal becomes king, this film just takes off. I guess, upon reflection, that these people were teenagers, and the rather childish scenes at the beginning are actually very clever if viewed as establishing a status quo which the course of events within the film thoroughly disrupts.
The action, especially the scenes of war, are dark and gritty and really exceptional. I am so pleased that these are in no way hokey. Too often films represent medieval warfare as a bunch of knights in gleaming armour, posturing with swords as though they and their armour weigh nothing; but this was so much more realistic. I'm a fan of compelling war scenes, and this film has them.
I thought the acting was really good across the board, even from people who I don't normally like. A special mention goes to Joel Edgerton, a brilliant Australian actor who always convinces. His portrayal of Falstaff was perfect."
199,"Congratulation to Netflix to deliver this gem of a movie, everything was perfect from the acting to the dialogues, and what dialogues !
I recommend this movie to everyone and if Netflix could start making more good movies like this it would be awsome !
I will put 9 out of 10 only because i think it only misses a few battles , in a Sword movie I love to see Sword fights, there are good ones for sure but it could have a few more or they could take a longer time in a 2hours+ movie. Otherwise it is perfect !"
200,"Wow, seriously just wow. Top grade storytelling, cinematography and acting brings to life one of England's historic events. Although filmed in beautiful locations (including Lacock) they still managed to bring out the ugliness of that period. I could not stop watching from the moment it started. It's so refreshing to get film making like this, oh how I've missed you.The lead, at first I was unsure of, a young lad trying to pull off being a king, oh how I was wrong. He knocked it right out the park along with his heavyweight supports.Congratulations to the whole production team and big thanks to the director for helping me put faith back into the film making industry. I didn't spot one out of place politically correct message, it was told as it should be told and allowed me to fully escape into the that world. Absolutely awesome."
201,"I didn't expect it to be this good. I see people complaining that it was too slow, those are the people who need action nonstop and can't appreciate a well told story. I thought it was near perfect! There's really nothing negative I could say about this movie, it really blew me away. Highly recommend it!"
202,"The script is simple & covers most of Henry's life. Am pleased Netflix took a chance with this historical drama, it's thought provoking & the battlefield scenes are realistic. Good acting."
203,"This is now a top 5 favorite film of mine. The acting was amazing and the flow just right. Good pace, no over the top action sequences, plot twist and pure acting. Cinematography was also on point. This is how a movie should be made. Take away all the glits and glam of cgi (Marvel, DC) and actors have to show what they are made of. Timothee Chalamet did just that and excelled!Oh and by the way, it's so good I've watched it 3 times already."
204,"I still own this movie I didn't want to just discard it. ""I have only ever hoped for one thing!"", And it's movies as moving and rich and calm and strong as this one, about it's century, kings and who to trust and cunning so subtle, vision and the fortitude of a King, trust being such a rare commodity without hidden agendas of greedy ambition etc. Watch it. Absorb. Preferably alone quiet surroundings."
205,"The King masterfully mixes elements of deceipt, vengeance, ambition and pride in a historic depiction of a man who only seeks peace. Its plot unravels the fate of a man who did not ask for his burden but, nonetheless, accepts it so he can pursue the only goal he ever had.
The King is lead by a brilliant range of acting and directing, supported by an unsettling soundtrack. It has some of the most crude and intense battle scenes we could ever hope to see these days in cinema. It truly does not disappoint in its ambition."
206,"If I wanted to attend a history lesson or learn accurate history then I would go back to school. That being said, what I really a. Is a man that wants to be entertained by watching a good movie. Fortunately for us, this is a truly entertaining film! Those of you reviewers and historical buffs that are crying out that this movie is no good because it doesn't strictly follow the actual events that took place.
The reason most of us go to the movies or watch a film is because we wish to be entertained in the most satisfactory way possible! If this requires changing the truth similar to the way other GREAT movies changed the historical account to create a masterpiece then by all means please do so!Many other great films have VERY noticeable historical modifications made to be able to increase the entertainment factor. To name a few of such films is quite easy: Inglorious Bastards, Once Upon A Time in Hollywood and many other great films have intentionally changed history to create a masterpiece of cinema greatness. We are to be entertained as cinema lovers, as that is why w3 hav3 come here correct? I cam to watch a movie and be entertained. If you came here to study for history then you have com3 to the wrong place.The acting: fantastic! The King's method acting young star Is nothing short of great and I expect to see him in similar and even much larger roles in Hollywood.The cinematography: Very good. The shots are wide and expansive including much of English moors, forests and actual castles. We feel as though we are there.The sound: Grim and foreboding music accompanied many of the scenes in thi# film, albeit quite a serious and somewhat grim atmosphere throughout the film, I feel as though it works as such. In some places the LACK of sound and music spoke strongly for itself. It is not GREAT sound, but rather good enough.The actors: I recognize many of the actors in this film as many of the young experienced Hollywood and English professionals that they are. I feel as though it has been well cast with some new faces mixed in with the veterans for a good effect.Overall: this certainly no masterpiece; however, for what it is with the budget they had, this is certainly a solid 8/10 film. It entertained me. As many ""historians"" have quite loudly spoken about this film not being historically accurate, I say to them that if I wanted history I would go to school. This is a movie, so I want to be entertained and this film has delivered on that front providing a good escape for the somewhat long 2 hours and 20 minutes. Well done! Watch this one.....unless you are a historical buff that is!"
207,"Finnaly a historical movie without the constant need of fight, but still very interesting.
Sadly it seems very loos based on actual facts, but nevertheless interesting:
i saw and heard
a strong focus on the storytelling on pointsome compelling characters and actorssolid Pictureworka Production that let me invest in the worlda silent but strong scoreWhat i missed
more historical accuracya bit more information bevor, after an to the Details of that timeI think that, out of financial reasons, this could'nt bei made for cinema. there would be no market for this, when the cost of advertising are considered. So i'm glad that netflix did it."
208,"Might not be historically fully correct but great actors and plot. Particularly the battle scene was great as it shows that the war has nothing noble or heroic in it, it is dirty, painful and tragic. Really good movie"
209,"Before watching this movie I had read some reviews about inaccurate historical information, which yes is true. Some parts are twisted, as well as the timeline, especially when talking about the Hundred Years War. The plot was moderately gripping, however not as much as I had hoped. The casting was done very nicely, even though some would say that they only cast Timothee Chalamée and Robert Pattinson for their looks, which I definately would not agree. Having seen many films in my time, and many of their films as well, I can say that they are both outstanding actors that always give a great performance. The only thing that disturbed me, was the inaccuracy with which they percieved the war. It was a war that lasted more than 100 years, however they had made it seem as if England had won instantly. I do understand that it was in order to give the film a beggining and an ending, but maybe they could have done it differently. As far as the historic inaccuracy goes, they could not have done it in another way, as the aim of the film was to depict king Henry. As one cannot do a detailed biography of each important thing he had done, it was necessary to ""cut it short"", in order to present as much as possible. As I have read many negative reviews regarding the historic part, I would like to remind people that films are not documentaries. We watch documentaries for historic facts and evidence however, we watch movies for the cinematography, for the moving performances of the actors and for the entertainment."
210,"Very nice picture, not boring at all and a great excellent performance by Timothee Chalamet"
211,"This is an excellent film. It kept my attention from start to finish. It has a great set, cinematography, and actors. I had only recently heard of Timothy Calumet because of the Margot Robbie photobomb at the Oscars. He's an amazing actor. This film has so many great actors, Ben mendelsohn, John Edgerton, Robert Patterson, Stannis Baratheon's wife, Johnny Depp's daughter. Great job.I do want to add that movies are not documentaries. I don't expect them to be a blow-by-blow of History. Movies like this do encourage me to research what really happened. Movies are movies I think people are smart enough to realize that they add, change, and fabricate things for dramatic effect."
212,"I'm not going to say anything apart from well done to Netflix and the team for producing a great, yet subtle and understated film. Spoiler alert, the moment with Paterson on the battlefield is a fantastic nod to Monty Python and the Holy Grail - if it wasn't deliberate then my mother must surely be a hamster."
213,Least I expected from netflix - a masterpiece like this. Giving my detest to netflix I gotta admit - this movie's awesome. Even bought this movie once in a lifetime. If Netflix made all movies like that I'd even buy it's subscription
214,"Most realistic and believable account of Henry V and the battle of Agincourt as a movie. Excellent script, acting, direction, sets, costumes etc, felt like I was actually there in 1415. One of the best movies Netflix has made to date."
215,"The cinematography, tone, dress, performances and the fighting are all bang on,
The pace and tone might not be for everyone, it's not Michael Bay movie,
But I loved it."
216,"A very well directed film, beautiful colors, atmospheric music that highlights the agony of the situations.Very realistic portrayal of a duel or even a whole battle, without many dance moves, the characters fight with nails and teeth in the mud when the swords fall.
Agincour's battle enjoyable, full-fledged genius of strategic planning, very well directed with the camera inside and not out of battle.Moderate casting, I was expecting better actors to head the cast.Exceptional volume escalation and very careful build character."
217,"Immersive, beautiful, delivering. That's how I'd describe this movie. I'm not a biggest fan of it's story, but the visuals and overall feel of this movie bring joy to my medieval-loving heart"
218,Entertaining even though historically inaccurate. Watch it for what it is.
219,"First time I watched the movie, didn't like it. Then, I saw many people were quoting the movie and got hooked to rewatch it. Well, the script is really brilliant, every line is deep and to the point. In fact, very uptodate. The cast is stellar in particular, Sean Harris, Joel and Ben. As for Timothee, most of times his performance was great with slight drawbacks from time to time. I think he as very young actor needed a guidance from the director, as Luca Guadagnino did in CMBYN. Anyway, Timmy did a great job and mostly kept a high score in front of more seasoned talanted actrors. Kudos to him!!!!!"
220,Excellent! Bit of a slow start but I see why it's popping up on top ten of the year lists. Michod is a director I'm just now discovering but really like his work.
221,"What really decides on our path of life ? Nature, nurture? Or our own choice? If we are bred and raised in a certain environment can we be truly free to choose to make the right choices? Or are we pushed by our own circumstances towards what is needed of us even though we know it is wrong. Can we beat our genes? This movie is truly a masterpiece and leaves you wondering as you watch the young kings descend towards what he tried to leave behind."
222,"Everything was nice and all, but it was kind of hard to believe that Henry (Chalamet) was more than 30 years old at the end. They should have aged Chalamet somehow, he's too twinky."
223,"Film as it should be...reminds of 'Wolf Hall.' The cast is matched perfectly, although Ben Mendelson seems uncomfortable as Henry 1V."
224,"This movie was well written, produced and executed. It will teach you that you never know who your true friends are and in this case, it was a lesson. Always step back, think and learn to trust those that have been consistently loyal to you. There's a lot to take away from this beautifully executed film. Thank you."
225,"Since making his stunning debut with Australian classic Animal Kingdom in 2010, director David Michod has struggled to deliver a project to the same high standards he set for himself, with the good but not great The Rover and the genuinely lacklustre Brad Pitt starring War Machine failing to showcase the director we saw unearthed initially.It's pleasing then to see the Netflix released The King show more than its fair share of promise of the director we know exists, in what's a well-filmed, acted and staged epic that at times transcends itself to become a moving and contemplative examination of power and leadership as it shines a light on King Henry V.Teaming up with his long term friend and collaborator Joel Edgerton (who also makes his mark on screen as the no fuss John Falstaff), Michod and Edgerton craft a grim and grey insight into the time in which England found itself at war with France and under the leadership of a previously reluctant leader in the shape of Timothee Chalamet's Hal.There's nothing surprising about The King's narrative movements, one that feels similar to any other similar medieval epic, but Michod and Edgerton explore some interesting themes in amongst all the betrayals, beheadings, battles and bloodshed, that's expertly played out by a very capable cast.Continuing on his hot form that has now gone on for a number of years, Chalamet is well cast as Hal/Henry V and the way in which Chalamet moves from drunken slacker to a man determined not to make the same mistakes as his father is perfectly constructed, a performance that is backed up by the reliable Edgerton, a solid if underused Ben Mendelsohn as King Henry IV and a scenery chewing and thick accented Robert Pattinson as the detestable Dauphin of France.For a Netflix film, The King also feels a cut above a number of its other counterparts with Australian D.O.P Adam Arkapaw's cinematography capturing a mixture of beauty and horror effectively, while Nicholas Britell's thoughtful score ensures that Michod's vision is enhanced by some moody and atmospheric accompaniments.If there is a notable issue holding The King back from reaching a higher level of accomplishment, it would be that throughout, many of the films characters remain cold and unreachable, even Hal is a hard figure to completely fall for, while many of the films other players are never allowed to grow fully enough for us to invest ourselves in, had the film managed to instil itself with more of a beating heart (say like a Braveheart), its likely Michod would've finally had another Animal Kingdom on his hands.Final Say -A step in the right direction for director David Michod, The King is a well put together epic that should appease historians and fans of sword and sandal extravaganza's, that also features a number of solid acting turns that help maintain a constant level of engagement, without ever fully hooking us completely into its time and place.3 ½ rain predictions out of 5"
226,Good lord why have we become so dense to try to draw parallels to today's politics environment with every movie? It was a movie about a 15th Century King loosely based off of Shakespeare... and it was a great movie. I don't get the Trump this and Trump that talk... just shut up and make movies Hollywood and shut up and watch them America. Good God everyone's losing their bloody minds....
227,"You ask yourself, is this movie in any way different than any other modern classic?
Will it differ from its history predecessors?A Shakespearean family tragedy of war and suffering, of life and death, of goodwill and resilience.When you keep your mouth open throughout the thing, you know that there's something different, not partially but fully.Chalamet(hal) gave us his greatest performance, yet its buried underneath the piles of films hollywood produced, the great cinema, the place where people go to, you forget such gems exist!People think that when netflix produces, its an instant failure, a conspiracy that should be long forgotten.a crazy 7.3 rating that baffled my mind, how could it be? People might not share my thoughts but a collection of details proves my point.Directing, camera work and cinematography, acting, colors and editing, set design, a score composition that grips your heart and mind instantly, but thats not all.An uncanny battle that puts the likes of game of thrones to shame, your heart starts beating fast, no control over your breath, you start contemplating whether you should be fighting along side the king or not!How oh how is this movie not well recognized, i have been watching so many movies lately and I haven't felt such an urge to rewatch it seconds after it finished.ALL HAIL THE KING!"
228,"Great acting, great story. Well written and pacedIgnore the other comments about historical inaccuracies, if you want that then read a text book. If you want entertaining for 2 hours with great acting, watch this."
229,"I initially skipped past this film, thinking it was another over the top historical war film - until I saw it was directed by David Michod. I loved Animal Kingdom.
I am so glad I watched the King. It had such beautiful cinematography, fantastic performances (especially from Timothée Chalamet and Joel Edgerton) and brilliant direction. It felt much more realistic than other historical dramas, especially in battle showing that awkward jumbled mass of bodies, horses and mud. My only complaint, I wish they had fleshed out the relationship between Timothée Chalamet's and Joel Edgerton's characters more."
230,"My Review : Netflix The King. My Rating 8/10Another fine movie denied a decent Cinema release by Netflix I couldn't help thinking how spectacular some of the sets and locations would look on the giant screen.
I know it's my soapbox but I view this latest trend as a form of censorship and I hate any form of censorship. The censorship comes in the form of exclusivity to Netflix customers only.
I digress but it angers me if anyone can explain how a film that obviously costs millions of dollars to produce ( Netflix don't divulge their production costs) can recoup the costs with no advertising on Netflix just from subscriber fees I'd like to know.The King is a beautifully produced movie I notice Brad Pitt is ons of the producers and of course it's the tale of young King Henry V and the Battle of Agincourt in France in 1415 which was just one of the battles of the 100 years war.William Shakespeare wrote his play Henry V in 1599 and now 420 years later Australian Joel Edgerton and David Michod have written their version of events and written them very well indeed. Joel Edgerton is an excellent screen writer as he showed us in 2018 with the excellent film Boy Erased in which he exposed the evils of gay conversion therapy.What impressed me about The King is that it's not a 21st Century dumbed -down version the dialogue is all believable and while not Shakespearean it still has almost an ""operatic "" feel without the arias.The performances are wonderful especially Timothee Chalamet as King Henry V a young almost metrosexual pale Prince who gives up his playboy Prince sabbatical to return home and take the throne after his fathers death.There's a lot of Australian talent in The King Ben Mendelsohn is impressive as King Henry 1V and of course Joel Edgerton is very impressive as John Falstaff the Kings most loyal friend and ally. It's also beautifully directed by Australian David Michod .
Robert Pattinson gives a good brief performance as the nasty threatening Dauphin of France who taunts the young King and ultimately falls on his sword.It's interesting that Timothee Chalamet and beautiful Lily-Rose Depp ,who is lovely as the French Princess Catherine are actually romantically involved because Timothee's meteoric rise to stardom reminds me of Lily-Rose's father Johnny Depp's amazing career start except I think Timothee is developing into a better actor with greater range .
I'm looking forward to seeing him in Little Women later this week at The Cinema on a decent sized screen in a movie that all film goers can see without having to subscribe to a streaming channel.The King is a long film 2hours 20 minutes,it's not a fast paced action movie but Australian director David Michod who also wrote and directed Animal Kingdom is an expert at portraying his characters personality and emotional state and I imagine he's a Dream director for actors to work with.It's interesting to see the role of English King Henry V played by a New Yorker of French decent and in contrast an English actor cast as the Dauphin of France The King is a very impressive film."
231,"This movie is faultless in all aspects. I've enjoyed every moment of it from start to end. Time spent on seeing it, is definitely not time wasted."
232,"All ""The King""'s problems speak from its opening scene. We see the sun dawn on a desolate battlefield, where Sir Henry Hotspur (Tom Glynn-Carney) assesses his victory, and stabs a crawling survivor to death in the mud. It is a brutal and unflinching deed, committed by a handsome young man with a contemporary haircut.That says it all, really. ""The King"" wants to have it both ways: to portray the Middle Ages in a historically accurate manner and to appear relevant to 2019 audiences at the same time. Yet the one devaluates the other.Take Henry IV (Ben Mendelssohn): None of the exalted nobility and gothic gloom of John Gielgud here -- that's way too theatrical for such a serious undertaking. So what does Mendelssohn bring to the character? He plays him like Denethor of Gondor. Just watch any of his scenes: once you've noticed, you cannot unsee. How this is more realistic or benefitting the character in any way beats me.Similarly, Joel Edgerton has rewritten Falstaff, 'Shakespeare's greatest creation' (Orson Welles), to make him less larger-than-life. And what do we get? A more buoyant Davos Seaworth.Edgerton's performance ensures what I have been suspecting all along, namely that ""The King"" wants to be ""Game of Thrones"". It wants to indulge in the same courtly intrigue and massive onslaught, but hides behind the name of one of history's greatest authors. This produces a fascinating trail of derivation: a film inspired by a series adapting a novel inspired by the plays this film insists on adapting.So Falstaff becomes a war-marked mentor and Bardolph, Pistol and Nym are out. Lord forbid we enjoy ourselves. 'Don't you get that ""The King"" has something serious to say?' you might argue, 'You cannot remain serious with constant comical intermezzos.' The thing is that Shakespeare could do precisely that. His plays remain simultaneously funny, touching and thought-provoking to this day because he was a great writer and had a matchless feeling for narrative tone and pacing.It is the lack of these exact qualities that sinks ""The King"" -- not the mere fact that the script differs from the play, but the manner in which it does.The big new spin that writers Edgerton and David Michôd put on the story is that Hal is a pacifist now. He doesn't drink and hang around because he is young and cocky, but because he is revolted by life at court and the cost of war.Chalamet certainly deserves the praise he has received for his work here. He gives everything the script demands and more (his pronounced cheekbones even make for a visual similarity with the real Henry V), but it is precisely this script that is lacking. In the entire film, Hal's gloomy attitude is disrupted not a single time by a moment of happiness or joy. Yes, Laurence Olivier may have been too much of a golden boy, but Chalamet is so edgy it feels like a missed opportunity that he doesn't apply eyeliner. As a result, the film has but one tone, and it happens to be a very weary one.The turning point in Hal's development occurs when his brother Thomas (Dean-Charles Chapman) is sent to beat down Hotspur's rebellion. Last seen snoozing in a tavern, Hal suddenly appears on the battlefield in full attire, challenging Hotspur to a duel to prevent further casualties. Besides the fact that an adaptation of ""Henry V"" borrows its core dramatic material from ""Troy"" of all films, the dialogue in this scene is unbearable. 'This is *my* battle! (...) If I have my way, there'll be no battle (...) These men are not our enemies!' Such eloquence would not misfit a Roland Emmerich film -- or, indeed, ""Troy"". The writing and directing are at times so terrible it makes you want to throw up.If you're not too busy wiping puke off your carpet you will notice that the ensuing sword fight is actually great. The duel is awkward and dirty, dominated by constant panting and the rattling of ill-fitting armour. If this is the realism the filmmakers were striving to achieve, props to them. Such a shame that most of the film is 'Agamemnon vs. Westeros'.When Hal finally becomes Henry V, king of England, the film arrives at its core dilemma: will the pacifist Hal manage to... No. The answer is 'No.' ""The King"" wants to be all about the gradual corruption of power, but within two minutes Henry has a grudge against France, and within 20 he is beheading his own courtiers. He bites his lip twice, then starts a war. Anakin Skywalker's conversion to the Dark Side was more gradual than this.The meat of the film is an hour of pedestrian warfare. Don't look for any tactics or character insight; it is just fighting in a supposedly realistic yet aesthetically appealingly manner. Even the odd appearance of Robert Pattinson's positively psychotic Dauphin -- the only character who appears to be enjoying himself -- can only raise the spirits for so long.Just when you think the worst is over, the film ends with a comically shallow message about manipulation and (out of nowhere) female empowerment; as if were saying 'Don't you see how relevant I am!?'I am sorry, ""King"", I was busy ordering a carpet cleaner."
233,"Gritty, gripping, beautiful. I came into this movie with no expectations whatsoever and left amazed. It's subtle yet complex. I shouldn't even be writing these very words because they raise said expectations to people who haven't seen it yet. Just want to express these words somewhere, hoping that I can convince someone somewhere to invest 2h20min of their life into a underrated masterpiece such as this."
234,"Top quality cinematography, keeps you focused.
Very very interesting point of view in battle scenes, it gives you a more authentic approach.
Great plot. Chronologically correct.
Best acting by Timothe (the King)"
235,"I'm not Shakephere fan and my rating is not because of story fails the original story. Movie was entertaining And worth the time. I did find it too slow and the film too dark literally.
Netflix is to be congratulated for the effort."
236,Enjoyed this movie a lot was a bit slow through parts but all in all a very satisfying experience watching it. Would recommend it! Good battle as well
237,The plot itself is quite entertaining but for me personally the score is the highlight of the movie as it gives it an obscure and melancholic touch. Great work by Nicholas Britell.
238,"The King is a pretty bland and forgettable Netflix movie. Just because it is bland and forgettable does not mean I would call this a bad movie. There are elements that I did appreciate. I thought Robert Pattinson did a great job and I felt that his character was interesting even with the small amount of screentime. Timothee Chalamet started giving a pretty good performance in the second half of the film and Joel Edgerton did good most of the time. The sets were pretty great and looked authentic to the time period. This is the same for the makeup and costumes. The costume design is the only aspect of the film I felt was fantastic. There are a handful of good shots and a single good piece of music and I think the 3rd act battle scene is well done. My biggest issue with the film is that it isn't presented in a unique or interesting way. In short, the film doesn't stand out. The cinematography is pretty bland and uninspired for the most part. Besides one or two shots, I don't remember most of the scenes. The music is pretty bland and sounds a lot like stock music for the most part. The acting from everyone else ranges from decent to bad. None of the acting besides most of Chalamet's performance and Pattinson's performance was that great and was mostly passable. The script is pretty weak in most areas and the story generally isn't that interesting. I was bored for a majority of the film. I'm most likely going to forget about this film before the end of the year. Overall, The King is not a bad movie but it doesn't do anything to make it stand out from anything else I've seen this year."
239,"Very good movie of what is essentially a modern version of Shakespeare's ""Henry V"". The evolution of Hal into Henry is well done, the performances are solid, and the action sequences-especially the seige of a French castle- are excellent. I felt the final murder was inconsistent with who Henry had become, but aside from that its a solid piece of what is essentially historical fiction."
240,"This movie had a great cast, especially by casting Timotheen Chalamet was the perfect role for becoming Henry V, on the other aspect like score, cinematography, editing were all great but not the best. One great part of this story is the dialogue which is fairly well written among the characters.There's one scene on the medieval battle kinda resembles The Battle of the Bastards from Game of Thrones, which is filled with horror, blood, killing and well claustrophobic but I kinda feels HBO's GOT done that scene better due to the budget constraints but it's fine.Overall it's a great movie, great battle , great dialogue and great performance from Timothee Chalamet !!"
241,"Beautifully acted and directed, The King is a riveting film. It's over two hours long, and every minute is watchable. Much of the dialogue reflects the spirit of Shakespeare, on whose work this film is based. Henry V is still one of the most revered kings in English history, though it didn't start out that way. Lead actor Timothee Chalamet does an excellent job portraying Henry's transformation from dissolute hellraiser to a young ruler of growing maturity.
His supporting cast is peerless. Sean Harris brings his usual intensity to his role as Henry's top advisor. Joel Edgerton gives a fine edge to his performance as Falstaff, and Robert Pattinson chews up the scenery as the French Dauphin, a nasty piece of work.
The costumes and sets lend authenticity, and the battle scenes are remarkable - and brutal.
This is a great viewing experience....and not to be missed."
242,What an outstanding movie by Netflix. The scenery was perfect and everything according to history. It was a bit long but very engaging because I never lost interest or stopped watching it. The role of Timothée Chalamet was awesome he literally lived up to the character.I just wished this was a TV Show because I think I would have enjoyed it way more as it. The character selection was awesome and I TV show of Henry V would have killed it.
243,This film uses historical facts and game of thrones style battles and it's good and I just stumbled across the movie.
244,"Excellent movie based on the famous battle of ""insert french name i can't remember"". I am sure the makers took their liberties to make it an interesting story with interesting characters to watch. Nonetheless it is, while slow at time worth every minute and exactly the type of movie i like to watch and relax.
It has authentic fighting styles, good gore and most importantly the vampire dude acting with a french accent and like a total dick. *wink*"
245,"I've watched this film 4 times now, and each time I've noticed new/different things, the main thing being that this film is a masterpiece.
Some scenes are a little slow, but you've definitely got to stick with it!
Timothée Chalamet is the perfect casting for Henry V, he absolutely nails the role.
Robbert Pattinson also deserves a mention for he too nails his role as the Dauphiné.
The music score is powerful throughout the entire movie and compliments the cinematography perfectly.
Although I will say that some certain things are historically inaccurate, the two major things being; Henry V did not kill Sir Henry Percy as shown in the film, and the Dauphiné was nowhere near the battle of Agincourt. But I can see why these events were maybe altered for a more dramatic effect, and to be fair it works!
The main thing I can say is watch this movie AS a movie for entertainment and not to get the full true historical information from."
246,"Real battle scenes; good cast and costumes, overall liked it."
247,Every Netflix movie there is this lingering feeling that the movie could have been so much more if more money were pumped into it. Netflix is getting better at that. Chalamet's performance was very good. He felt numb but emotional. Should have bulked up a few pounds for the role though. Pattinson's portrayal of his character was a huge surprise to me. He was venomous and intense..
248,"Acting is superb. The film is a raw account of the realities of war and however noble our intentions may be, there is always corruption somewhere in the midst."
249,"I really advice you to watch this masterpiece. It's really that good. Netflix has finally produced something good. And not just good at that, but marvelous.If you like the genre that this is a must watch. Actors are excellent, the scenery is stunning, foto is great and effects even better.Can't wait for Edgertons next script. Hopes are very high. If this was a series my year would be made."
250,"This was one of the best historical films I've seen. Very easy watching, totally believable characters and very well acted and directed. Lovely to see battle scenes fought down and dirty in the mud at ground level. I was hoping it would be pleasing, but it has surpassed my expectations. Thoroughly recommend."
251,"This was one of the worst films I have seen in my entire life. I didn't think it was possible to deviate that far from Shakespeare or history, but they found a way to not only cherry pick whatever plot points they decided were relevant to the misguided rendition of the story they wished to tell, but rearranged them into easily the most boring cinematic creation I have ever set my eyes on. Robert Pattinson deserved to be in a better movie."
252,Film goes on for a very long time with next to nothing happening.It all leads up to one big event which lasts no more than 15 minutes.Huge anticlimax.Nothing happening again then until the end of the film.
253,"I don't usually watch this type of movies but it was a great surprise. Everything is lovely about this movie, the acting, the cinematography, the dialogue, etc. I surely enjoyed Henry's journey and his character development was something good to observe. I loved the war scene and I wish Netflix keeps producing this movie gems!"
254,"I don't get it why this movie gets so little credit and is rated with a 7.4 at the moment. It's without a doubt Netflix's best release and when it comes to the acting and plot, I must say it is superb! The story was so compelling and it is clear the movie was made with a huge budget, making the film even more spectacular as all details were taken care of!A must watch, especially for people who appreciate this type of genre!"
255,"Excellent, it is a movie done well, where you can feel the twist coming, too bad the finale didn't last long enough, bit it was worthed"
256,"Great movie, good story, acting masterpiece... Also the music, not complex but its perfectly. Thanks for this great work, enjoyed every minute."
257,Omg that war speech was the best I've ever seen. The story was catchy throughout the movie. Great work
258,"I didn't see this movie coming and have no expectation. However, this is a real gem.What surprising me at first is that the Percy got killed in the very first 15 minutes. It is nowadays very rare for a modern screenwriter depicts the main character Henry in this old and effective manner. The movie doesn't have much battle scenes and relies heavily on well-drafted conversations. Some setup could be easily spotted are about human weakness and the payoff are amazing. The last battle scene is not made up of CG but the revelation of the violence and brutalty.However, The best part of the movie is after the last battle scene. It questions about the nature of war and politics. The King raises the high bar of period war movie.If you love Game of Thrones (except the last season), you would love This King. The King is also far better in terms of depth."
259,"This newly adapted look at rise of Henry V and the Battle of Angicourt pays homage both to the historic play by Sir William Shakespeare as well as the characters that lived the tale.Far from historically accurate, this telling focuses on the ambiguity and flawed humanity that often accompanies calls to war. Kudos to Joel Edgerton for such a brilliant story, and bravo to a stunning ensemble cast.I'll be watching this again and again."
260,"Is engaging and enjoyable, the acting is superb and the darkness is very different than the usual Netflix movies!!!"
261,It's worth the watch. Carve out 2.5 hrs. Great acting across the board. Timothy plays a great lead. Rob Pattinson did a great job as well.
262,"This movie is one of the worst movies ever I seen in 10 years. The 140 minutes can be easily, simply and efficiently be done in 20 minutes, and I think 20 minutes is a long time"
263,I loved it and thought Robert Pattinson's performance as the French dauphin was hilarious in a good way!!!
264,"Wonderfully presented story. Well shot, well written, well acted. Simply beautiful."
265,Amazing cast. Amazing set. Amazing storyline. Amazing director. ... and i am french
266,"I really enjoyed this movie. I appreciated that young actors were playing the roles of Henry and the dauphin because they were young men during the time depicted, previously actors who were really too old played the roles. Good script, good acting and attention to detail really made this worth watching ."
267,"God damn ... Just finished watching this masterpiece. The story, the characters and the battle scenes are so great and amazing, that I got the feeling that this movie actually happened in real life, just in front of my eyes.
We need more movies like those, that shows the true struggle and the pain of the soldiers from the battlefield.
Good job Netflix, long live THE KING !!!
Just a side note here: Hal is the exact opposite of Joffrey Baratheon/Lannister. Just wanted tk say that xD."
268,One of the best movie on Netflix of all time. If you love to watch triller or drama is masterpiece is for you
269,"Hope after watching this they'll consider Netflix in Oscar's. Such an underrated movie, I feel bad about the people who check ratings before watching something. I'm sure they will miss this gem."
270,"I said that if I was too young the main actor would not play well, but I was wrong, playing very well, it was really out there, good picture, good sound. it was worth watching and I recommend this movie."
271,"The King does an excellent job in adapting its source material (William Shakespeare's King Henry IV & Henry V) for modern times. The dialogue feels realistic and authentic to the times, yet it never feels too Shakespearean for a modern audience to really connect with. The scope is grand yet not too overbearing. The story is provocative, but still rather personal.This is probably the best original film that Netflix has ever put out, it's gritty, it's epic, it has a lot of heart, and all of the performances are incredible, the standouts being, of course, Chalamet has the titular Henry V, and Pattinson as the Dauphin of France. I'll tell you what, Pattinson is going to KILL IT as Bruce Wayne."
272,"As a fan of medieval movies, this movie is a classic example of simple storytelling done right with the exact amount of superb acting.Not too overbearing and it draws inspiration from many other epic films of its genre.A sublime piece of art.Well done Netflix. Well done."
273,"Brooding, slow-moving historical fiction, where gravelly voices and woeful string instrumentation do little to disguise a simole story of a boy with daddy issues."
274,"The King was a pleasant surprise. Great acting by Timothée Chalamet. An interesting story about how someone with no direction in life, who never wanted to be king, becomes King. The big battle scene reminded me of Braveheart. Robert Pattinson is memorable too in his small role."
275,"Sean Harris is the worst actor in it and sadly has to much screen time.
If they replaced him I think it would have been so much better.
Brings the film down overall and is very distracting to the plot. Not sure how he won a bafta as he's awful."
276,"So, it might not be exactly the true events of the Battle of Agincourt. I don't know; I'm no historian. I just read a couple of books that didn't seem to probably get it right, either.
It was, however; a satisfying movie. All the basics are great (acting, cinematography,etc....). And I couldn't believe how well and exciting the action scenes were without gore. It really represents the carnage without any blood; I would've said that's impossible before seeing this.
It is an action packed and thoughtful ride. Highly recommended."
277,"I've never seen a movie or anything that depicted medieval war so brutally realistically. Fully plate armored knights fall from their horse or are pulled to the ground where they are overwhelmed by lightly armored troops sticking long daggers into their visors, and other weak spots in their armor (neck, armpit etc). Hammers, axes and picks are much more effective (against plate armor) than swords that are basically used as long iron rods to hammer each other with. You even see knights holding their swords both at the handle and blade using their pommel to hit people in the face.Then there is the cavalry charge that's absolutely brilliant. Characters hit by the cavalry charge are hit super violently and are literally thrown on the floor due to the sheer power and weight of the cavalry charge. Never seen such a realistic depiction of a cavalry charge. Henry's friend whose name I just forgot stands in front of his line (bit dumb in my opinion) but when he is charged he is smashed into his own line and literally flies backwards due to the cavalry charge. In stark contrast with what we usually see on TV. Like with game of thrones where a certain person who ""knows nothin"" runs towards the enemy lines and then survives a cavalry charge while standing in the middle of the battle field on his own.
That said, the movie should have been at least 1 hour longer. So much was not told and some parts were historically inaccurate. Like why is the movie pretending Henry did not want to be king? Or that Henry was this hippie type character at first? I guess it makes him more likeable. They are doing the whole insecure anti war boy becomes strong ruler. Which is simply not true. Henry had been leading men into battle since he was a child. He wasn't new to this.Like these are sorta my biggest issues with the show. Henry's friends give him blind trust but there is no reason why? Because he is better than his dad? He multiple times wants to slaughter all his captives, crucify.them etc completely opposite to the boy he was at the start of the movie. War sucks and it's a lot of pressure but we barely see him have to deal with any adversity and yet this dude goes from ""war is bad"" to ""let's kill all the French rats and crucify them""
My point is. Even of they wanted to take so.e liberties with the story they should have at least prolonged it and given room for more character development.The movie shows parts of henrys life and makes a narrative out of it. Ignores a lot of stuff around it and never tells us what happens. There is no 3nf scene with ""Henry lived a couple of years more but then died, his son.never really ruled France"" etc.All that said. It is still a very good and interesting movie. And the battle is absolutely fantastic."
278,"Fabulous film making It can be said its not Shakespeare or correct history, but from my research the history isnt far off.
What is outstanding are the production values THE ACTING ! , lighting, direction, script , locations - its all excellent.
The reason this film was made is Joel Edgerton realized that this part of European history is about as important as any in history, and defines the English.
Its a great story.
The English crown was anyone's for nearly 400 years starting with William 1st (1066).
When Henrys' new wife Catherine says ""we are all usurpers"" it was true. The crown was up for grabs particularly in England.
Please see this, it doesnt drag, it is more like a slow burn."
279,"I enjoyed the props, costume design, battle recreation and sound effects - which means that the research team was capable - but that's all. The acting and script is very weak and specially Pattinson is attrociously awful playing a dumb French character. Finally, the worst of all is the sloppy visual aspect of this thing.The cinematography is so bad that it almost looks like a current North American film production. Any perfectly calibrated screen or accurate projector may look like a damaged device while playing this movie. Somehow the mediocricy of digital colourists is spreading across continents, like a disease outbreak infecting all cinema. The imagery is so poorly captured and manipulated in post-processing that most of the movie seems to be shot in the light of the weirdest candles ever made, casting an orange light with greenish shadows. Also the sunlight coming from the windows is intensly yellow but casts green and blue reflections on the wooden or stone walls. It's ridiculous. Even the few exterior takes have an awful use of light and colour capture - the sky is often green and the moon is cyan, but the whole scenery, including clouds and people's skin, turns dark blue in the ocean scenes. All the lighting and colour work of this movie looks terribly careless and incompetent."
280,"This is one of the best movies I have seen this year. The acting is exceptional, and though not quite historically correct, it is very close.
I would have liked some historical facts to have been shown at the end of the film before the credits, so have given it a 9 instead of 10."
281,"One of the best historical pieces I've ever seen. Great setting, great actors and amazing music. I just wish the movie was longer and that they explored more areas of the story."
282,Timothee Chalamet is an amazing actor! He's going to be a big star!! I'm excited to see him in more roles. Mesmerising performance and a very well written movie
283,"I was sceptical at the beginning, as the other Netflix films are boring to say a least and waste of time (in my not so humble opinion) . But I thought i'd give it a shot. Acting was superb, enjoyed every minute of it!"
284,"If you love old English history and well spoken movies with brilliant actors this is the movie for you! I was moved by just about every scene. I absolutely love a good war movie with a good story. Death, treason, passion.. all the good ingredients for a wonderful film!"
285,"With a Netflix production you have only a fifty fifty chance of getting anything decent and even those odds are diminishing with the newer projects.
First of all....... no one , not one single person, was ""tasked"" with doing a job back in the late 1300s . They were ordered, or told, or commissioned to do the job but never tasked. That's because task is a noun, you buffoons! What are they teaching in film school these days?As a movie covering an epic tale, this one is about as thin as a sheet of graphene, more like the ""Holy Grail"" made serious.A few have commented that there is no character development (or very little at the most) and I have to agree.
They must hire their producers from Hallmark cards because it has all the feel of ""The Gift of the Magi"" but maybe I'm just too demanding.On the good side it does have great costuming and evil looking and scheming courtiers. If some of the supporting cast had been brought in a bit more it could have been much better production.
I'm beginning to think that I myself could come up with much better stuff than most of the latest from netflix, but they won't let me out of the old people's home for fear I'll get lost.
If you've got time to waste or it's the inflight entertainment, then indulge yourself but if you have to make any sort of effort to see it .......... don't bother"
286,"Netflix invested what I assume was a great deal of time and money on what could have been a sweeping epic. Instead we are treated to whispering, angst ridden performances that drag the film down like the weight of full armor on the French knights at Agincourt. Timothee Chalamont's performance as Henry is sadly lacking in emotional depth. Robert Pattinson 's French accent was the equivalent of high school actors trying to capture foreign accents. The battle sequences at Agincourt were taken directly from Game of Thrones. The production is wasted simply because of poor acting or direction."
287,This film was phenomenal must see. Read the title. Fillerfillerfillerfillerfiller hit the character requirement.
288,"""The King"" is a modern revisionist-history reappraisal of the rise of King Henry V of England (""The Ideal King""). It is a story that has been done before and, one might venture to say, done rather better, by the likes of William Shakespeare. Like most modern movies, nobody in ""The King"" speaks above a murmur, a mumble or a whisper, not even when they should be making themselves heard before an audience. It is also very modern in that it depicts the Middle Ages as having taken place entirely in the dark or, at best, during the hours of twilight. The movie also persists in the modern belief that, contrary to the evidence of the numerous Medieval illuminations of artists such as Jean Froissart, the Middle Ages were a period completely devoid of color. According to the makers of ""The King"", in those days mpbpdy dressed in anything but black, brown or gray, all of the trees and grass were gray, and even the English flag, which is well-known to consist of a red cross on a white background, apparently consisted during the Middle Ages of a black cross on a while background. In fine, this movie undoubtedly will appeal to those to whom revisionist history appeals, and will not appeal to those who appreciate the poetry of William Shakespeare."
289,"I don't care what the critics said about Timothée Chalamet, he gave a great performance. I was enthralled with him. This was a great movie, the acting, costumes, the relationships and intrigue of the king and court. All great story telling. All the actors were believable. No B- or C- list acting here. Oh, and if there's a question about him moving into ""heartthrob"" status like Robert Pattinson (which I did read in another critics review) don't worry. He's a handsome young man. And his portrayal here as an intelligent and strategist king, make him and the movie even more appealing. Definitely will be watching it again; probably a few times."
290,The guy acting as King Henry is a gifted actor. His emotions are so real I felt it to my bones. Captivating. I'm glad I watched it.
291,"This is a terrific film and, above all else, worthy of your time.Much has been made of its lacking in historical fact, or its failure to follow an accepted storyline, but to slavishly follow either of these courses would have delivered a movie we have seen many times before. What's the point of that?One word: adaptation. Any screenwriter worth his or her salt is going to play with historical fact or the essences of a work of fiction; after all, who wants to see the same stories copied over and over again?I remember thinking just this when so many people complained that a recent retelling of Agatha Christie's The ABC Murders, was so different to all the others. It had to be, otherwise we would be seeing the same thing repeated endlessly.This movie tells as much as we need to know of history and is a worthy addition to the many tv and movie adaptations we have seen over the years.If I had a prior reservation about this film it was the casting of Timothée Chalamet as a fighting King. Surely too slight a build to portray a warrior. Well, whatever this extraordinary young actor lacks in physicality he more than makes up for in sheer screen presence. A gritty and convincing performance. Maybe not an Oscar, but surely a nomination.Don't look for accuracy here. Go see a documentary or read a textbook if that is what you want. This is a retelling worthy of its own entry in the annals of cinema history. Bravo!"
292,"I'm not even going to mention historical accuracy because most of the realistic reviews in this list already took care of it. The movie is dull, slow paced and long, too long for it's own sake. I know epic/medieval movies have high standards (due to masterpieces like Braveheart, The Last Samurai, etc) and it's difficult to achieve such quality, but The King drags you through an exaustive narrative and the characters are too shallow. Great photography, though. It lacks a true and immersive soundtrack like Horner or Zimmer."
293,"Now first things first I am no History expert. So I don't even know how accurate this movie is. But I am judging it off just a Film alone. And this movie is so GOOD. Timothee Chalamet gives a GREAT Performance as King Henry V and so does the rest of the supporting cast. The score is really good and so is the story of the film. The story is so relevant now about war. Especially the reveal at the end. It's about every recent War we have in real life, what was the reason for it?? The beginning of the movie is a bit slow but it isn't enough to turn off a viewer like me. Check it out. It's on Netflix and is definitely worth the watch!"
294,"This movie hasn't been on my radar, and I wasn't really excited to watch it, but I decided to give it a chance and after watching it, all I can say is wow. I didn't expect this movie to be so epic and brilliantly crafted. This movie is a powerful and brutal look into the consequences of power, and it has brilliant performances from Timothée Chalamet, Joel Edgerton, and Robert Pattinson. It also has breathtaking cinematography that incorporates natural lighting and strikingly epic shots. This is definitely one of the best movies of the year!"
295,Netflix need to do more like this. What an amazing film.
296,"I enjoyed this movie considerably. Timothee performs excellently. He has matured well since starring in ""Call me by your name"". As a Warrior archetype, I found a lot to like about this movie."
297,Its dark. Its gritty. Its bloody. Its intense. Its fantastic to look at with amazing cinematography and great acting all round. The ending is the icing on the cake for me so intense. Robert Patterson was brilliant also was nice to see him in a different role to really show he can act. A must see film.
298,The King is really dull but when Pattinson and his unique French accent appears it's like a whole different movie. He does it with joy. You can see he had fun with the character. Too bad it's just for a few minutes.
299,A very interesting historical story shot beautifully and starting some first claim actors. Timothée Chalamet is excellent.
300,"From start to finish, I was in awe over the mastery of filmmaking that was involved in producing this film. The acting, the writing, the lighting, the cinematography, the special effects, the CGI (though, genuinely, I couldn't tell when it was being used and I work professionally in post production) was incredible. I think this will go down as a classic. I think I may even watch it again, it was so good!"
301,"I came to this having read the twaddle from the Guardian, Globe Mail and Washington Post critics saying it was messy, boring and not enough of a ripping yarn. Their loss. Beautifully written with a superb sustained story arc. As for the odd user review that complains about lack of historical accuracy - that obviously means Shakespeare never wrote anything worthwhile. Don't worry about the naysayers, listen closely to the quietly magnificent script in the hands of some superb actors, and enjoy it."
302,"I watched the outlaw king and i like it very much as a story and as an acting's so when i saw the king trailer i watch it without thinking because i love history stories and to be Accurate the middle Ages so if you watched robert bruce the outlaw king maybe there is differences between these two movie But ""the king"" is for you."
303,"This is a gritty, but somewhat predictable, historical gem from Netflix. The acting, dialogue, and cinematography are excellent. There is a bit of a plot twist that I was pretty suspicious would be the case, and in I think the plot is a bit rushed or forced from the start. Maybe that is because there is so much that happens in the story, so something is bound to get rushed somewhere.Part of the problem is probably how Henry V is portrayed as a sympathetic hero who is only invading France due to insult and to firm his support at home. This is fine from a point of fiction, but Henry in reality invaded France as a way to demand historically English (the royal family was Norman/French in origin) lands that the French had re-taken during the Hundred Year's War. He wasn't a hero as portrayed here. Obviously the politics/history is beyond the scope of the movie, but by forcing Henry to be more sympathetic, the movie contrives reasons for his war that are not quite believable. As a result, the movie works largely as a gritty medeival action movie, but the plot isn't too coherent/believable. Had they made Henry's motivations more real, the movie would probably be more believable (but far less sympathetic). In Shakespeare's time, English nationalism would make this more acceptable. Now, in our cynical day, it is less so.I think this sums up most Netflix movies for me. They feel rushed for some reason, even when they are long (2 h, 20 m in this case). A bit more consideration would have made this far more epic, even if it was still false to history. Hell, Braveheart is 99% fiction but is still a great movie."
304,"I'm actually a fan of Timothee. But his acting is unforgivably flat in this movie. Every shooting put him at the best spot, showing his face in the perfect angle. But I can only tell king George IV is really unhappy (which is like his other movies) and Tim is breathtakingly cute in this 2h20m film.
I do hope it could focus on the character's development but not just using the latest technology shooting the most beautiful face."
305,"Very slow movie . boaring , save your time and watch something else"
306,"I had to search this film out at the Cinema (Netflix sort out your deals with cinema chains...). Well worth it, great film from the start and builds as it goes along. All actors are great (well not sure if Patterson was having a laugh, but did work). Not really into Shakespeare, so don't get confused that you must be a fan to enjoy film, it stands on it own. Great plot with nice realistic twists.Last 5 minutes was a fitting end to the film, a boy, to a man, to a King."
307,"2 hours of my life I'll never get back, woeful stuff."
308,Timothée Chalamet best performance after CMBYN hands down best take on king Henry !
309,"Great performances,marvellous script, don't be fooled by the bad reviews !"
310,"I thought this was a very well done and tense film. It does make you feel bad for Hal that he's thrown into this life he never really wanted and doesnt know who to trust. Who's really there for him and not just because of his status. I thought the battlefield shots were great too. Very bloody and dirty and makes you sad/angry about war. And stylistically I thought shot well too. One shot in particular I liked was this overhead shot of Falstaff getting lost in the field. And speaking of Falstaff I thought Joel Edgerton did a really good job of playing him and he also chose to make the character more sympathetic. He also is less cowardly than portrayed in Shakespeare's works. Its an interesting take and I actually liked the change.Acting wise, I thought the cast did a very good job. Especially Timothee and Joel. The one disappointment I had acting wise was Robert Pattinson. It's not the worst thing in the world but in comparison to everyone else, his french accent is a tad over the top, some of his mannerisms when you first meet him are a little silly, and then theres a scene later on where he keeps falling in the mud. Tonally, I felt like stood out like a sore thumb. Im sure that's also how he was written/directed to be....but ehhhh just didnt work for me.The only other thing to mention is that the film is over 2 hours long and does feel like it in places. There was times where I was wondering how much long the film was going to be. So, some pacing issues.Other than that though, I did really enjoy the film. No, its obviously not super historically accurate (especially since it includes Shakespeare's invented character of Falstaff) but the cinematopgraphy and the general story and acting were great. It is a quite dim story and if you don't like gore there are definitely gonna be scenes that make you a bit queasy."
311,"I don't get timothe's appeal.
His act is poor.
No depth, nor believability. His hype didn't add a single good thing to the movie, and actually ruined it for me."
312,"While the long-winded storyline might bore some, it would be hard to dispute the absolute beauty of the imagery of this movie. Timothée's portrayal of King Henry V is both convincing and enchanting. I would easily re-watch the film just for him."
313,Absolutely loved it! I genuinely have no complaints about this movie. Definitely holds #1 spot of netflix original movies for me.
314,"You can scroll through half a hundred weight of negative reviews about historical inaccuracies and more. All i'll say to that is Braveheart won 5 oscars.This is a very interesting entertaining turn. The story is layered and does unfold its slower pace does reflect that in that era things didn't move quickly, you travel by horseback , disease did kill lingering , slowly.I agree in some cases some of the actors are under used based on the size of there parts however it speaks much more that actors of there calibre were willing to take smaller more niche rolls over more screen time to play a part in this production.Timothée Chalamet is showing himself to be a coming man and versatile. This was an interesting role to see him in. His english accents well done not russell crowe at all .Definetly worth a watch"
315,"Acting okay, cinematography nice, though a little dark, some of the fighting scenes seemed realistic.It's quite slow paced but started off promisingly and held my interest but it then went downhill and I didn't think much to the climax of the film.I don't mind historical films that take a few liberties with reality for the good of the story, but parts of this film were just ridiculous. A king taking all his direction on tactics from a fictional grumpy old drunkard from the Shakespeare plays was bad but then everyone stopping the middle of a huge battle between thousands of men for a 1:1 fight between two king was just plain ludicrous."
316,"I can't believe this has 7.3 on here. This was, if not, the best medieval movie I've ever seen. The fight scenes in my opinion showed what real battle in that time would have been. Amazing. If you like medieval history or henry v, watch this."
317,"As a period piece, this is a rarity. In virtually every aspect, this film knocks it out of the park.The writing:
it is easy to follow, even to somebody who doesn't know the life of Henry V at all.it is historically accurate, for the most part. Even down to the language, which was so beautifully written to match both the character's intention, their stature, and the nature of the time periodthe character development is incredible.The acting:
as long as Timothee Chalamet is in it, you can trust it to be somewhat good. Chalamet, like always, brings his A-Game into a powerful role, and sells a level of stature beyond himself. It's pretty cool.Joel Edgerton is outstanding. It is truly amazing to find an actor that will make you genuinely feel and relate to their character, and this man did it for every line. Completely different to his role in Exodus, and he nails it.Robert Pattinson was the surprise standout performance of the film. Yes, he's in it. Yes, he is AMAZING.Finally, the directing:
every single piece of blocking is so intricately choreographed that you have no question as to what is happening... you just know. You are taken away into the world of the 1400s.the action sequences in this film are stunning. I can't say much without spoilers, but from a filmmaking standpoint, they achieved a level of proficiency and excellency in violence caliber to none. Just watch it.Of course, the cinematography was also one of the best I've seen in a long time, as well as the score and makeup and costumes and all that jazz. But I think you get the picture. This isn't just a movie, it's a film. It's quite possibly THE Gem of Netflix Original Films"
318,It is a must watch on Netflix. Awesome performance on every level for the you Timothee and as always Patison.
319,They tried to adapt Henry V for modern audiences but took out so much of the good stuff and replaced it with muted brooding dialogue and change up/add scenes that drag the story down.
320,"This film is probably bearable, if not presented as a story based on a real life historical figure. The reason why this film doesn't work is the sheer audacity of the writers to make the film about ""washing"" a figure just to suit their narrative. (Just create a new character, if all you want is to tell your story, why bother stirring up the past?)Even if we focus just on the technicalities of the film then also this film is just not good enough.The writing is just bad.
And you know pretty well enough about this yourself, when you see almost every scene in the first half starting from someone waking up somebody from deep sleep (or just someone who is pretending to sleep). First few times it's okay, then after that it's just lazy writing.
Speaking of writing, this film (at a certain point) seemed more of a vessel for Edgarton's character to shine rather than about some great monarchy of England. (Edgarton is also the co-writer of this film, just saying)
The war sequences are nothing which we have not already seen in other movies. The long war choreography with men valiantly fighting each other is just a cliche now. Moreover the fact that England beats France with rain is kind of far fetched and doesn't come out of the realms of this cinema.The music is good. But with it's monotonicity, doesn't uplift the story. The cinematography is ambitious. And production design manages pretty well.Speaking of casting, Chalamate is probably not the right person to play The King. He is an overrated actor. I am sure there are characters which he might nail while performing. But King Henry V was not one of those (at least for me).Overall a decent film, if you could overcome few boring moments here and there."
321,I thoroughly enjoyed this as a fantastic piece of storytelling. It was gripping from start to finish - not always easy in a movie over 2 hours - with fantastic performances and breathtaking cinematography.One star deducted for being quite historically inaccurate. Didn't diminish my pleasure in watching the story unfold but adjusting people's perception of historical events isn't a good thing.And another one deducted for being highly imitative of Game of Thrones. At times it felt like someone decided to make the Battle of the Bastards Extended Version.So 8 out of 10 and definitely worth a watch.
322,"Good acting, good story, good action and actually really enjoyed it. Well done Netflix for starting to make more quality over quantity."
323,"'The King' is a Masterpiece. Timothée Chalamet was amazing as Hal (The King). The storyline is great. It keeps you awake every single second. Some of you might know that this is based on literature works (Henry V, Henry IV, Part 1, Henry IV, Part 2) by William Shakespeare, and hey.. who doesn't love Shakespeare's work ?(nobody)The movie revolves around the 15th century. After his tyrannical father dies, Hal, wayward prince and heir to the English throne, is crowned King Henry V . Now the young king must navigate palace politics, the war his father left behind, and the emotional strings of his past life.This is a historical drama movie, and this is the most amazing movie of that kind I've ever seen till now. It is intense, every actors in it acted strong, the cinematography was amazing. I cannot think of any other cast for this movie, they were amazing. It's an epic movie which will make you take no break in between. You must watch it, or you'll regret it later."
324,"This movie was really good, it will definitely one of Netflix's best movies this year, top 3 at that. Still yet to see The Irishman. The writing was good, the acting was damn good, the action scenes were well done. I knew Timothée Chalamet was a good actor but he was eye catching as he portrayed King Henry V."
325,"I REALLY don't understand the ratings for this film, not only on IMDB but other platforms as well. I thought The King was riveting, with a great Performance from Timothee Chalamet, and Robert Pattinson. It should have a higher rating and is definitely one of my favorite films of the year."
326,"I have never been into history. Tales of stories long past never really interested me tbh! This film however caught my attention straight away, the characters and setting are nothing new but I genuinely enjoyed the story and felt every emotion of Hal by the end of the film! Well done 😎"
327,"I didn't expect this movie to be so good. Normally NETFLIX has a little bit low rated movies. But this one was great. The theme of the movie, costumes, etc. And the most I liked was the lights the rooms was illuminated with candles. That makes it very original."
328,"The best Netflix film to date. I didn't expect a lot but was pleasantly surprised by the pacing and the performances. As a lover of history I was ok with the story which had to fit a 2hr window. I would have given it 10 if the battle scene was a little more detailed and longer, but most audiences can't sit still that long."
329,"The story is so far off fact its painful for anyone that knows the historyAs a film story then it's all over the place and makes little of flowing nicelyShakespeare invented but he knew how to write events to elevate charactersThe acting isnt that bad, even the Keano quality accents"
330,"The King's ratings are probably diluted down because of the (alleged) lack of historical accuracy in the movie.
Since this bloody chapter of the 100 Year War between England and France has been depicted by many - namely in Shakespeare's epic plays - it is only natural that people dislike any deviations from reality.
To me personally, it is not a deal breaker. Perhaps because I am not fully aware of the inaccuracies depicted in The King.As for the movie itself - I think is a very good portray of how a young King rose to power. His transformation from a drunken kid at fault with his father to the rightful king and leader of an army is well performed by new Hollywood hot property Timothée Chalamet (Call My By Your Name).Joel Edgerton plays his right man and protector Falstaff - but also co-writes the script with director David Michod, a collaboration previously enacted in Rover.Overall the movie has a solid score and visually ambitious scenes. Namely, the climax battle of Agincourt is reminiscent of the superbly conducted chaos of the best battles we saw on Game of Thrones, for example.The things I disliked about the movie are perhaps the lack of something more epic. Everything seems planned and going in the right motion. There are not many changes in pace. There is a relevant twist near the end but other than I thought it needed to feel grander. More epic that it really felt.Also - nothing against Robert Pattinson, but why casting an American actor and make him a cartoonish jackass with a fake French accent? Would it not be easier to cast a French actor to make the accent more believable? Found that part to be a bit childish.But in any case it is a good historical epic movie - more a 7.5 than a 8 really - and a visually and creatively ambitious one for Netflix. Worth a watch.PS: Netflix had already ventured in the genre in Outlaw King, but I think The King is a superior movie overall"
331,"I loved the look of it. The acting was good. The stroyline was well conceived. Despite all this though it was OK. There was something missing from it. It wouldn't deter me from giving this a generous 8/10 but still, something didn't fit. It was poerful though in it's own way."
332,"The movie was truly immersive and enjoyable. It easily keeps your attention for the entire 140 minutes, which is difficult in today's day and age. However, it doesn't always do it with action or great set pieces, but with mesmerizing dialogues and a few great jokes that are played straight, making it even more hilarious.I liked all the actors involved, but I LOVED Joel Edgerton. He steals every scene he's in. Great writing on his part too. This year Netflix has a bunch of great, original movies. Just kick back and enjoy the spectacle... unless you're braindead and claim this is boring. In that case, go watch the Kardashians."
333,"The King has everything you want from an historical drama, particularly if you are male and love battles. The battle scenes are awesome, though still fall short of the literal thousands that actually took part. Close-up fighting means you won't really notice. But The King is also a thriller as well as a drama. There are some very unexpected twists. And it has a conscience, which is perhaps the main theme. This is the real surprise. It's a beautiful piece of writing, keeping within actual history, yet expanding for intrigue. Many of the characters are truly well done. It's brilliantly cast in that regard. Oh, and Henry actually looks like the real Henry. I can't tell the filmmakers how important that is. There's an overall darkness, that is, low light, to the piece. The medieval ages were lit by candles. Whatever, it works, as does the muted tones. The King will be one of the more respected historical pieces for 2019."
334,"My expectations were definitely not high, I expected to watch the film for 5 minutes and get bored. However, the film sucked me in in the first couple scenes and I begun to see the talent of the creators of this film. The cinematography and acting were top notch and the well written and well paced scenes opened me to the characters and the world in which they reside.Confusingly, this film made me question my sexuality more than ever I've ever questioned it before, as the protagonist of the film was more beautiful than most women."
335,"It is a great and universal story. The streetkid that slaughters the French army.The most important scene is that of the battle between the (spoiler alert) heavy armed French troops drowning in the mud, slaughtered by the lighty armed Englisg troops.As it is shown in the movie, the battlescene is a copy of the 'Battle of the Golden Spurs', anno 1302 in the mud of the Flemish fields between the French army in armour on horses and the lightly armed on foot Flemish army, as it is described (romantisised) in the 1812 novel by Hendrik Conscience: De Leeuw Van Vlaanderen (The Lion of Flanders). In this 'The King'-movie, they even show the moment where they not collect the spurs, like in the Conscience novel, but in stead the swords of the French. A beautiful symbolic moment in this movie.A must watch story about wisdom above arrogance."
336,"Timothee Chalomet is outstanding as Henry V, and the script is very nicely written."
337,"A welcome change in Netflix' originals. The cast was perfectly chosen for each role. The realism of the battle was a rare treat. Not many movies about the dark ages depicts battles like this one did, awkward movement, no overscaled armies...And let's not forget how the music fits perfectly with each scene. A dramatic and realistic gem amongst Netflix's originals!"
338,The dialogue and writing is not very good. Plus it's totally inaccurate historically.
339,"This film was well made, brilliantly cast and an absolute joy to watch. The leading cast performers were brilliant and time just flew in. I am not concerned by total historical accuracy as long as the film keeps you actively engaged which it did for the whole 2 hours. I loved it ....."
340,"A true masterpiece, brilliant acting and directing, with an engaging soundtrack touches you deeply and the deafening silence among certain scenes is pure emphaty. Highly appreciated."
341,"Great performance from all the cast, beautiful shots and a great film at last from Netflix."
342,"Don't expect this as strictly accurate historically because it's not. You'll enjoy the movie more if you take this as a work of fiction that's loosely based on historical figures.Solid acting and directing. Cinematography could be better since there are several scenes that are too dark, you can hardly see the actors' faces.This is not a thriller, it's a slow burn. All in all, a solid, quality film."
343,Great pace. Great cinematography. Great acting. Great struggles.
344,"Without the gravitas, language or drama to disguise that it's ....all just silly men's business. The cast and script is a disaster. Why was this made?"
345,"Ok, there are a few artificial and modern devices and phrases thrown in that seem forced and a bit of PC nonsense. The do mar the surface of this screenplay and production a bit from perfect to nearly perfect. But so too do verbatim Shakespeare productions with his anachronisms, kowtowing to the then contemporary sensibilities and interests of the Tudor court, and his glossing of the Hundred Year War chevauchee warfare (going around the countryside and killing all the villagers and farmers when your 'noble' opponents won't leave their castles) -- which in modern times would be classified as a major war crime. So this is a ""based on"" story written by one side, just as all of Shakespeare and virtually all war stories are since the Iliad itself.
Even Hollow Crown, which is at least a star or two above this in quality, strains against the dishonesty in some of the source material.So aside from script writing/dialogue of this which is above average but does not excel, the rest shows talent and and an overall well done and entertaining work. Clearly they had to pick a young heartthrob actor for Henry V to have a prayer of getting the valued younger demographic viewer , but given so many of them are without talent, the lead actor, Timothee Chalamet, is quite talented and able to carry this film well. Sean Harris, has graduated from his whispering almost mumblecore Borgia days and is great. The rest of the cast is quite good, although Robert Pattinson seems to half play his part as camp and that is a tiny bit distracting.Overall though this is much better than Netflix's record of mediocre productions. Certainly accessible to all audiences as well, especially compared for example to the Hollow Crown, which as I noted is considerably better acting, but not really accessible to people not already familiar with the major events and characters from Richard II to Henry V."
346,"Finisht the movie 5 second ago, had to write something about it. The actor's are chosen perfectly, the scenes are truely beautiful and realistic, and the music is just 10/10. You should absolutely watch this movie, amazing story and the best movie so far created bij Netflix."
347,"Amazing film, loved it, actors are Excellent, will watch this again."
348,"Booring same story again and again, we want new creative stories that when we see them we will be amazed"
349,"As others have noted, while this film is quite entertaining, historically it verges on complete fiction."
350,Great acting! Netflix keep coming with the great movies!
351,"Just wonderful in all respects - acting, directing, script, sets. There have been a lot of medieval themed shows and movies of late. This story of Henry V ranks with the best of them."
352,"I don't know why so many people are saying that Disney + will win the steaming wars. I mean, how many star wars can you watch without getting tired really? Netflix offers all kind of entertainment. This movie is awesome. It starts a little bit slow but the payback is worth the time."
353,"Netflix sunk a lot of money into its version of Henry IV(2) and Henry V. It did not spend it well or wisely. What we are presented is a small kernel of truth with a vast coconut husk of fancy. They got the names right, at least.Yes, the small details of early 15th century life and so on were good. The first half of the movie focusing on the fictitious ""young Hal and Falstaff"" story line is acceptable for its well recognized mythology. But when the movie plays fast and loose with clear history such as the campaign against Percy Hotspur I should have known nothing good was in the offing. But I still held out hopes because the production values were so good. Yes the acting is good, particularly if you like brooding young men. It truly is a lovely, gritty tale. 75% fiction, but a lovely tale.The Battle of Agincourt is soooo wrong. Yes, there were archers. Yes there was mud. Yes there were French knights and men at arms on horse. Netflix had the opportunity to make a truly epic presentation of one of the most epic battles in military history. What a disappointment."
354,Timothée Chalamet giving such a wonderful performance! Great movie. I fully recomend it!
355,"Im not going to repeat what every other person have said so far, because i agree with all the praise. Theres just one thing i want to point out thats important for me: Im really glad, that i could watch a recent film production, that in no way try to lecture me about politics, values or anything such. I cannot think of another movie produced in the last years that doesnt in any way insert liberal hints in plots / scenes / characters / dialogue in a low key attempt to slowly brainwash me as a viewer.For this i am greatful. Finally i could just enjoy a movie for what it is."
356,"The movie was excellent! I did not expect anything like this from Netflix, but they surprised me.The other reviews said enough. I will just point out several moments that I believe are relevant to our times:
The guys who plotted to remove the king from power cited his non king-ish (non presidential) attitude and were concerned about his mental state.
There was consensus among his lords (17 intelligence agencies) that France (now Russia) was a threat, while she was not.
His best adviser (CIA/FBI/NSA) manipulated him to go into war.Sounds familiar?"
357,"The first 10 minutes of this is a good indicator not to continue watching. Character development is lacking, and the acting is at the level of a high school play. A total and complete waste of time."
358,The film goes ok with the first hour but then the battle happens and everything goes wrong like how does they know who is the enemy they are wearing the same thing and the death of Robert Pattinson character is so stopped that you feel like it's a joke and at the end they try to save the film by putting a twisted ending on it wow!!
359,"What a great movie.Co-written by Joel Edgerton, I would say good show mate. Great costumes and directing. The dialogue is fantastic. The soundtrack really puts you in the moment of the characters. I would also say that the fight scenes were really realistic unlike other fight scenes were you feel there's a lot of choreograph movements but watching this movie looks like it's, the fights, not choreographed at all,like mad fighting which should be the case in the mud and also during Prince Henry of Wales vs Sir Henry Percys fight scene. A good cast and great performance by Timothée Chalamet. All that said, the cast would not have done this with out a great Director behind the camera. Hats off to you David Michôd, cheers mate."
360,"No way in hell are these ratings true.. if your into loooóng drawn out conversation in shadow, vague attempts at action or just watching grass growing. then by all means this is for you. 20 minutes in felt like 2 hours.. if you want art.. go to the museum. if you want a good action filled period piece, look elsewhere because it's not here."
361,"This is not a boring movie but it's far from being an epic one. It basically lacks the emotion that makes movies like Braveheart stand out. Several scenes that should, or could, have been tear jerking, ended up being dull or just uninteresting because of the poor script, or ruined with dialogues charged with modern political correctness that of course don't have a place in medieval europe.Aside from that, the movie presents some inaccuracies from an historical point of view that ultimately portrays a wrong image of Henry V and other characters, as well as of the 100 years war."
362,"When it produces such mediocre movies! Everyone is way over his head in this movie! The young actors, the script writer and the director! Absolut no suspense or exciting scenes! Just flat!"
363,Not very good at all. a big waste of my time and their money
364,"Excellent!!!
Actors, scripts, time!! Everyone should be talking about this Netflix production. I'm glad it won awards because it's perfect!
👏👏👏👏👏👏"
365,"Wayward prince and heir to the English throne, is crowned after his tyrannical father dies. Now the young king must navigate palace politics, the war his father left behind, and the emotional strings of his past life."
366,"This is a fantastic film with monologues of succinct wisdom and restraint by King Henry V of England.
Although as he was known as a bloody warrior in his quest to conquer France and the progenitor of the Hundred Years War; this film shows his great distaste in having been betrayed by his own family and counselors to be coerced into this Battle stance whereas he had been one who had sought only peace for his country.Is this not the same with us, we love our home and our families but are told by those whom we respect that we must war with others and that we must ever vigilant against adversity?A simple man once who fought in a ring for a living; who changed his name's for his belief, said 'I am not at war with these people no matter what color they are! I am not one of you either so why should I go to war because you tell me to? (paraphrased)....I think hearing Muhammad Ali's words as a young girl clarified my purpose to support peace and repudiate war.Is it not clear now -oh my countrymen, living in a land meant to be the paradise where all who come are to be welcomed in spite of their differences or beliefs? Is it not obvious that we are being driven by false counselors of the airwaves, and even more, so the false leaders we've elected that we should battle each other?Whereas if we but joined together in a collaborative mission to truly, in reality, provide support to each other, each in our own way, to focus our energies as one to heal and support all life, that of man, mammal, fish, fowl, and plant alike!WE ARE THE CHILDREN Of GOD!
WE CAN CREATE The PEACE we so desire deeply in our hearts and our beings so much so is that we have been burdened by discouragement depression and discordance for generations because it has not been so.
SPEAK YOUR TRUTH!
TAKE BACK YOUR POWER!
And so it shall be done
Blessing of love and peace unto you"
367,"This was a film I enjoyed watching. The acting was excellent, the atmosphere was engrossing and the cinematography was captivating. The story line was very predictable which is understandable as this is based on real events but the ending I felt was very abrupt. There was so much more to tell and I was left a little disappointed and somewhat cheated after the final scene. It was as if the writers decided they didn't really want to develop the character of Henry and further. I was left with the impression that he was going to become another hen pecked monarch (as his son was to become), instead of one of England's most noted warrior kings. In my opinion if film producers such as Netflix are going to go down the road of selling us the promise of historical drama they should at least attempt to be as accurate as is reasonable. It is interesting to note that at least part of the film used Shakespeare's Henry V as a basis for the writing. He was of course well known for taking liberties with historical fact.
I"
368,Tim is incredible. Great cast. Watched it 2x so does Rob
369,"There are impressive battle scenes in this movie, and the costume design is excellent. Some of the cast perform very well, such as Sean Harris, Thomasin McKenzie, Joel Edgerton, and Thibault de Montalembert.But the story is poorly written and it greatly changes history. The real events of this time period are much more interesting than those of the contrived and rather silly story of this movie.1. They ignore the ten years between the Percy Rebellion and the death of King Henry IV. The king was just age 36 and not dying in 1403, he actually died in 1413. Henry ""Hotspur"" Percy, shown as a young guy about age 20 in the movie, was actually three years older than Henry IV.2. They chose the wrong actor to play Henry V. He looks much younger than Henry was at Agincourt (Henry V was age 29 at the time). Henry was actually a typical Plantagenet, a tall, athletic, strong man, not adolescent-looking. He had a stronger personality, he was more charismatic and better able to inspire his men.3. Henry V never killed Hotspur in single combat. Henry was just age 17 in 1403, while Hotspur was age 39, although they seem about the same age in the movie.4. Henry was not as rebellious and as much a drunkard as shown in the movie. He was, like many of us a bit wild in his teens, but this was greatly exaggerated in the movie. Although he probably had disagreements with the king, I doubt as a devout Christian he truly hated his father, as shown in this movie.5. Henry V never killed William Gascoigne, who died in 1419 at the age of 69. Gascoigne retired voluntarily several years before his death.6. The English nobility and clergy are all portrayed as stupid, scheming and/or cowardly, while the drunkard Falstaff is portrayed as wise, honorable and brave. This is rather silly.7. The Dauphin of France never came to meet Henry before the battle of Agincourt, nor did Henry go to the French camp to challenge the Dauphin to single combat. It would have been foolish for either to risk capture."
370,And slow paced. It does not help that we all know the ending. Did not add anything to my superficial knowledge of the history of the battle.
371,"I'm still of the opinion that Netflix should give large releases to their motion pictures especially seeing as many are worthy of such a large theatrical run worthy of the content on display. I'm bummed that I wont be able to see the upcoming ""The Irishman"" for the same reason. And while I wish I couldve been able to witness ""The King"" in a theater nearest me, it is not hindrance on the quality of the film.This is a film for a niche audience and one that perhaps only Netflix is in a position to fund and proudly support as of late, especially in this saturated market of summer tentpoles and franchise pictures. And it is for that reason that I adore this film even more. It is a full-stop motion picture set in England of old loosely based on history to tell the tale of a man who must truly find his own Avenue to become the man he is not meant to be but who he really is. And what does that mean for England? And for France? And for the loads of people who just want to get on with their merry lives. Without spoiling too much of the film, we follow Hal as he just come to succeed the throne from his father for whom he is greatly estranged from. In his unexpected succession he must grapple with whether or not he must go to war with France under suspicious circumstances. This campaign for which he must now lead gives us a truly interesting look at what it must be like for a young man to have to rely on older men, many of which he can't hope to fully trust, to council him to make decisions that grow increasingly more difficult to surmount.
The film takes a more subtle approach to character development as it shows Hal, wonderfully portrayed by Timothee Chalamet, come to conclusions on his own about who he wants to be but time and again be shown that who he desires might be impossible in the world that his father left in his wake. The cinematography is good and captures the tone and the beauty of the gloomy land of Britain and France while the musical score by Nicholas Britell is simple in its composition but by relying on strong strings and ambient sound design, adds to a steady tug of war between hope and doom.
The screenplay by Joel Edgerton and Director David Michôd is equally literate and compelling if nothing else, tracking the nuanced obstacles that our characters face.The film is a great reminder of the quieter epics that can still be delivered in this saturated market and one that Is both contemplative and ultimately highly entertaining. In regards to historical accuracy, it should be noted that the film is based in part of Shakespeare's Henry V and thus is more in line with classic Drama than historical documentary. Even still, the film has merits both technically and in the acting department that hold it up.This was a delightful film and a little treat in the holiday Season."
372,"This would have gotten a 10 if they had kept to the timeline of actual events. But, I won't elaborate. Great cast. Excellent acting. I was glued to it the whole time. Great portrayal of the time period."
373,This is one of those films that remind me that I should maintain my subscription to Netflix. What a day and age we live in to get such unbelievable theatre on our tv at the touch of a button. An epic.
374,Timothee Chalamet was beyond incredible in every scene. I hope he gets recognized for this performance. My new favorite actor!!!
375,"I came by this by accident, and I was not disappointed. Beautiful piece of history captured very well, excellent film work and wonderful acting. Watch now."
376,"I don't watch many movies anymore, owing partially to the onslaught of big-budget drivel that is presently stupefying the public. But this is not to say that I dislike movies! Few of the movies I do watch are so good as to warrant a review , but The King is one of them.I'd rate as a 10 in each of these categories: plot, acting, score, screenplay, cinematography."
377,"Most films play was historical accuracy. If you're watching the film for that you will be disappointed. However, this is an extremely well-made, well acted and well written movie! Chalamet is superb. So is Robert Pattinson. I imagine both of them will get nominated for their outstanding work.Something thought it was too long. I didn't feel that at all. I did skip through war scenes tho as that's not my thing, but overall it kept me in suspense, and that's quite an achievement for this type of film!"
378,"The natural qualms of many reviewers is that the movie is full of historical inaccuracies, and that it's going for a Braveheart level of 'authenticity'. While it would have been interesting with a more accurate account of the battle of Agincourt (sources after all describe the battle in some detail), this is nonetheless good enough if you like me have forgotten most details of the Hundred Years War. After watching the movie, you can spend an hour on Wikipedia to fresh up your knowledge on what really happened. or dive deeper in history literature.In most respects, this movie is truly great; I am not spoiling anything here to avoid having to mark review as such. I did fell the ending (most of the post-Agincourt treatment) was a bit rushed, on the other hand the movie is already at a respectable length at around 2:20 so maybe this was necessary."
379,"Nothing happens in 2 hours of the 2 h 20 min movie. How the hell would you rate such a terrible film 7.4? It had a lot of potential, but was wasted sadly.. Please next time indicate that the film is boring and the conversations and the story-line is so badly written."
380,Chamalant gives a very cool performance as Henry V. Shoutout to my aussies great film
381,"Nice soundtrack, acting, cinematography
Nice performance for chalamet, but in some scene his over acting"
382,"I thought it was good, but not necessarily great. A good part of the film I felt was a little bit too serious and brooding, and the pacing was a tad slow. The use of ""Olde English"" also made things a little bit standoffish for me at times.However, it did do a good job of showing the intrigues of the Palace Court and the burden that a King has to carry on his shoulders to rule a country. And of course it did a great job of recreating the Battle of Agincourt, one of England's finest hours.On a side now, why the hell is Batman French? And a little bit crazy? LOL. Anyway, highly recommended."
383,"Mendelsohn draws us in so subtly. The context of that lost father and son relationship is fleshed out perfectly in a form we have been telling each other since language was a skill for us.. The hook is set.
Familiar but satisfying ground perfectly played. The familiar is made new! ChaIamet, with his outright hostility to his father in his deathbed shows us the second side of this broken relationship. It renders depth and provides doubt.
I gained new respect for Robert Pattinson as he shows movie goers that small roles can be memorable. His portrayal of the French Prince was a revelation to me. It's the first time I've seen him become a character. He rendered his French Accent like a fish breathes water.
I might seem a bit too focused on teh
Joel Edgerton revealed a perfect English Accent and was a huge part of every scene he was in, whether or not he spoke. Not many can pull that off.
I might seem a bit too focused on the accents but they matter. After seeing Brad Pitt and slew of other A List actors mangle British accents, I like them well done.
A movie that will surprise many."
384,"With the success of GOT, there has been a renewed interest in late Medieval English history, and Shakespeare's history plays . The King is loosely based on Chimes at Midnight by Orson Welles which Welles based on Shakespeare's Henry V. It's the story of Chimes at Midnight told from the point of view of Prince Hal rather than Falstaff. Prince Hal is young rebellious and dissolute , Falstaff is his mentor in debauchery. Then through circumstance in-spite of Prince Hal's disavowal of the throne he becomes king. This all happens at the beginning to reveal more would spoil. All the references I mentioned at the beginning are alluded to enough to pick up on if you are familiar with them but don't get in the way if you don't know them as the film can stand on it's own.Beautifully shot darkly in natural light gives both accurate vision of what the late Middle Ages looked like and sets an emotionally sombre tone for the movie, the acting is very good and seamless, all the cast working off each other so none truly dominates. Timothée Chalamet is the lead and does admirable portrayal of the loss of innocence and idealism to the assumption of responsibility and in Medieval terms this also translates to ruthlessness. Some have mentioned that the film is a bit too long but this is necessary to set the tone and tell the story."
385,"How Temothee transfers from calm voice to anger and rage!!! And simple, open, cruel and unconcealed presentatipn of violence!! Absolut 10"
386,"And that's what it is, jingoistic rubbish, full of tired clichés (the degenerate coward French), lame story telling and dreadfully uninspired cinematography. Some of the better performances (like Edgertons) indicate it could have been a better film, but in the end there is nothing to be saved here. A bad film made at the wrong time.
I have to commend Pattinson though, who does a great job at portraying himself here."
387,"What a boring flick!
Story has gaps and the battles are not passionate compared to movies like braveheard."
388,"Gritty, realistic, strongly paced. The narrative that leads us, through the ages, to Agincourt. Done well. Strong performances bringing history to light."
389,"It looks more like a theatrical play than a movie. It is a bit confused, unconnected and the characters are two-dimensional."
390,"My god, what a well made Netflix film - Enjoyed every second of it. Based loosely on the works of Shakespeare, 'The King' has both drama and nail-biting action. It stars Timothée Chalamet who really deserved a Oscar nomination for his performance, but the supporting cast where brilliant as-well."
391,"You know what are cliche elements in a historical drama? This movie has those cliche elements and doesn't have them at the same time.
You believe the main character as a young boy and understand all of his actions, his weaknesses and his brave character to face his difficulties as a new ruler. Most of this connection is for Timothee Chalamet great acting and also the good writing and directing of the film.
The battlefield filming was also great and realistic."
392,"The King is based on plays written by William Shakespeare ""Henriad"", which were based on actual events. The movie has taken some liberty to change things here and there to move the story along, most notably the character of Sir Falstaff, King Henry's most loyal confidante in the movie but was disregarded as a fool and jester with no clear ending in the play (boo! loved the right knee bit.) The haircut is real, the immediate marriage to Princess Catherine isn't (took five years later, lasted only five months, reuniting when he was on his deathbed.) All the politicizing must have been real, as you know one thing humans are consistent with is greed.Timothee Chalamet proved he has already earned his stripes tackling this role with ease, a testament to the great actor he's slowly becoming. He has proven 'Call Me By Your Name' was not a fluke and that he can go as far back as the 1400s to add a scrawny yet authoritative King Henry to his Filmography. Robert Pattinson was larger than life, as was intentioned by the writer but there were moments where he came off as trying too hard. But the commitment was there to see the character through and he deserves praise for that. Note that Chalamet whose father is French plays an English king while Pattinson who is English plays a French prince. Lilly Rose-Depp, Chalamet's on and offscreen partner was only in the movie for a short time but managed to make her impact. Dean Chapman (who we adored in Game of Thrones, right?) was cast again as a prince eager to prove his claim to the throne.The set design paled in comparison to big-budgeted films but it's good enough if we're not being too picky. That drone shot mirroring Jon Snow gasping for air in the Battle of the Bastards, they knew would elicit comparison which they didn't seem to mind. As far as historical war movie goes, this isn't bad, but it isn't the most memorable. There have been many Shakespeare adaptations before and there will be many more to come. Unfortunately, this might get lost in the shuffle just as Prince Dauphine did in the battle of Agincourt."
393,"Yes I agree that, this movie is not 100% historically accurate but I think they tried to use chalamets moody and passive acting into their script and adapt and twist the historical truth. I think they wanted to put a twist at the end to shock the audience.Acting is superb. Music is on point."
394,"Whether the historical accuracy of the film is correct or not, this showcase of a medieval period drama lands flat in that, it tries, but fails to reach a deep enough character study for the main character played by Chalamet, with his motivations not fully explored, or his psychology as he takes on the role of king left almost as a second thought.While it is beautifully shot and there are a couple of highly accomplished action scenes, ultimately this movie shows its length, and however good are the acting performances, particularly from Chalamet, acting alone can't help salvage this movie from being sadly passable."
395,"I really enjoyed this film, the cast and the portrayal of the back-room kingdom plots and schemes. Battle scenes are done quite well, however as you can easily find, the historical accuracy of said battles was not fantastic.All in all, I still really enjoyed the character development, the politics, the battle scenes and having the young king Henry grow up through the course of this 2 hour long film."
396,"The casting of this movie failed a bit with the choice of the main actor. No, he wasn't a bad actor at all. However, he looks much younger than he really is and than the character was supposed to be."
397,The acting is SO good; Rob Pattinson is fantastic as the Dauphant of France! The history is told spectacularly. I'm glad I stuck with it because it took a good 30 or 40 minutes for it to get very interesting.
398,"8/10 but it's a dwindling one. It really scrapes an 8 just about, it's really close, and you know what, Netflix almost made an absolute hit,m. They almost united everyone under one rule - the "" i fu**ing love this movie rule"" - they 'almost' did.Hate me if you want, but I actually didn't realise this was based on true-events until I came on here to check the reviews, and to be honest, I loved it before I knew about the historical inaccuracies and the few niggles here and there people have picked out. Really, if I had known about the historical inaccuracies beforehand, would it have made a difference to this review?, probably not. I love it after too but it's an a 'what could've been' in all honesty. I don't think it's too long either, but they had the capabilities to create a masterclass here funding-wise, they really did. Just missed the bigger picture with this topic and setting - feels like they saw the headlines and gobbled up that thought. It's a shame Netflix will be the brunt of the hatred for something that could've been perfection.However, lets not forget the good things about this movie because it's entertaining and immersive if you can look past the accuracy factor. It's unfair to write a review and only have gripes with accuracy and no positives I feel, but hey, different rules for different people right? But here's a fair review, so I'll run through the pros and cons summarising each below for your reading pleasure.PROS
---
+ Acting: I thought the acting was excellent. Egerton and Chalamet are great, and the talent of the latter is noticeable immediately I think.+ Music & Sound: Excellent music and sound throughout. Really chosen well I feel, and all create immersion for the scenes and the vibes throughout. There's slight humour, grit, anger, tension, anxiety and it's all portrayed well.+Cinematics: Again excellent. As a spectacle, it's something for sure. It's shot really well, especially the battle scene. It's slow when it needs to be, fast when it needs to be; it's immersive at times and entertaining At times too, and that's what you want from this section really.+ Length: I think it's perfect to tell the truth. It's no Irishmen or OUATIH, but its no short either - it's right for me personally. It all knits together really well (inaccuracies aside) and I enjoyed the length. I was engaged throughout and wanted to see the next scene.
//
CONS
---Accuracy: So here's the rub. I guess it really does have to be mentioned because it's HUGE, and I don't think being American counts as a factor here lol (and yes I did laugh). They really should've done better with this, American or not. You don't set out to build a masterclass movie with all the pros listed above without researching first. It's just silly. If Its billed as a Historical movie, then why change the facts, if not, then fair enough, it's amazing. Like I said, I didn't realise beforehand, maybe I should've in fairness, but it's a gripe that has to be mentioned. Poor, poor on the directing part. I don't think anymore needs to be said, it's far too apparent and obvious to the history buffs and lovers of this time period.Historical Language: Now this follows a little from the previous con, but I think it's worth mentioning separately. Some of the language is a bit 21st century for the time period. Now I've seen a few other reviews with this factor and I agree, but it's not always present. Some of the language is very eloquently written and flows really well (but that might be the acting in part). Just listen a bit closer on your next watch, you might pick out a few.//Just two cons you say? Well they're big ones, but that's really all other people have been saying too as far as I see. A movie heavily downgraded for its historical inaccuracies both in events and language but one I loved out of my partly my own stupidity and partly because IT DID have some great features. Netflix almost had a viewership united, apart from some braindead research and a look for a cash-grab.8/10 but it's a dwindling one."
399,"Decent enough but i thought it lacked enough content. It felt like it was a battle and it was over. There wasnt enough story or background. Would maybe have been suited to a 6 part tv series.
Acting was good but i didnt get enough from the film to recommend it with any vigor"
400,Another fine addition to the Netflix originals that are vast and many are wonderful. It is certainly very slow paced at times as most of these middle ages epics tend to be. Much of the cast were people I had not heard of. There were a few though that I definitely recognized.The battle scenes were well done and the action was gritty and believable. I don't know how historically accurate it was as I know little about King Henry.There are definitely better movies based in the same era but this one is still worth looking at. Assuming you have Netflix there isn't much reason to not check it out. If you like movies with medieval knights and honor stuff then it should definitely be checked out and I would watch it again for sure
401,I was really surprised at how good this movie was. So engaging. It is a must see.
402,"Hyper realistic , great acting and cinematography. One of the best Netflix films I have watched in a while"
403,"In keeping with the surge of medieval dramas - popularized by Game of Thrones - Netflix has released another period film ""The King"" that sheds light on the lesser-known history of King Henry V of England during the early 15th century. One of the biggest issues with this movie is it last for more than two hours and I'm are still trying to understand protagonist's motivation. How did Henry V go from a reckless youth all the way to calling out an enemy to fight in single combat? How did he go from refusing his father's throne to accepting it? etc. The reasons are a little muddled. At the end, movie is an admirable, albeit forgettable, retelling of a well-known (Shakespeare) character. While it does have its qualities, the flimsy character development hindered me from investing emotionally into this portrayal. I'm glad I saw it, but I doubt anyone (except some old English people) will rush back to see this in the movies.Rating: 7"
404,This is the best movie of my life in 2019. Timothee Chalamet He is great at acting. I think it would have been nice if the season came out as a TV series rather than an original movie like Netflix. Made better than the game of thrones.
405,"This is a dark movie, brilliantly photographed and acted, maybe historically incorrect...but who wants to watch a High School History lesson in cinema?Watching Chalamet as King Henry with his angel like face demanding to kill all the prisoners of war was a moment which gave me goose bumps all over, one of many intense moments this movie offers. The Battle scenes are spectacular.
Chalamet is the most talented and gifted actor of his generation.
I hope he'll be having a great career ahead, as long as he stays true to the seriousness and the depth of his acting. He has a wide range of emotions to offer, between anger, fear, sorrow and sensitivity.
And that wars have always been built on fake reasons and lies...thanks for the screenplay to make me realize that."
406,"Great film, pitch perfect in terms of acting, casting, direction, soundtrack, pacing and execution.Nice visualisation of the Battle of Agincourt too."
407,"I now feel I've been as close as I could come to Agincourt and survive. What a battle. Truly one for the ages. Showing Falstaff as a canny old warrior who predicts (and explains) the outcome, worked for me, however contrary it may have been to either Shakespeare or history.Speaking of Shakespeare, I WAS disappointed with Hal's battle speech to his army. Naturally, the writers couldn't having him spout Shakespeare's inimitable words. To have had him mention ""band of brothers"" or ""St. Crispin's Day"" would have destroyed the illusion of reality in the present movie. But I think Shakespeare's concept of Hal claiming to not want even one more warrior there, though they were greatly outnumbered, because then there would be less glory to share - I think that could, and should, have been stated in contemporary words. Also, the incredible pride which survivors would feel for the rest of their lives, and could share with grand-children (and the envy of anyone not present on that day.)I thought Robert Pattinson was fascinating as the Dauphin. I didn't know beforehand he was in the movie, and did not recognize him at first - only thought to myself, Who is that riveting and strangely handsome presence? In only a few scenes, he deftly projected a slimy evil that was a necessary counterpart to the not-totally-good English.One error, I think, was not to adequately introduce the audience to whomsoever became the disembodied head that the Dauphin had the little boy carry to Prince Hal. Who was it? A female? It didn't look like the sister. No other clues.I watched the movie as an English major who has read all of Shakespeare, and a history and battle buff who has read most of Churchill, and I was riveted to the screen for the duration of this movie (which is longer than movies I usually watch.) I was thrilled with this rare film, and came away feeling that I understood much better what happened at Agincourt, and the complexity and mystery which lie behind great events of history.Thank you to all who made ""The King"" possible."
408,"I feel so sorry for people behind creating such movies, when I see movies which are empty of everything, of plot, of good acting, of music, yet they are perceived as great movies just for a well known director or a famous actor, while real pieces of art such as this movie are completely underrated and underestimated, a great film, brilliant acting, breathtaking music and cinematography, and a good plot, am really glad I watched this, thank you for making this movie"
409,"Hal (Timothee Chalamet) receives word of his father's, the current King of England, illness. Right now, Hal is leading a quiet life as he has turned his back on his family. Hal soon finds himself in a challenging position and feels forced to accept the life he once tried to ignore. After his father dies, Hal becomes King Henry V and must now take over from where his father left off or perhaps... Hal might even take a different path all together, especially regarding war and delicate topics such as politics. Thankfully Hal won't be alone. Hal invites one of his closest, most trusted friends from his hometown, John Falsaff (played by Joel Edgerton). In the past John was once a knight but in the present day he spends most of his time sleeping and drinking beer.For the history and Shakespeare buffs out there, I can warn you in advance to keep an open mind while watching the film. This film does in fact take a different path at multiple times compared to what the history books may actually tell you.The introduction to ""The King"" is a slow burn. We gain a basic understanding of Hal and his life, but the story goes back and forth as he talks with his father and mopes around in his current life. Needless to say, once Hal is crowned King Henry V, I found myself rather curious and wishing to progress further into this film.Visually, The King is a great looking film. Cinema buffs who own the latest high resolution TVs will be impressed with the film. The image quality for Landscapes and Costume designs should also be praised here.As for performances, ""The King"" is generally loaded with positive experiences. Actor Tim Chalamet as the lead role was generally fine but I felt he got better as the film progressed (and no, I'm not just talking about his character). Robert Patterson I would say for most part was also fine. Solid praise should go out to Joel Edgerton who manages to deliver a fun and heartfelt performance and was easily one of the best elements of this film.As a plot, apart from the slow start (20-30mins in), I generally found myself enjoying the film more as it progressed. Naturally the film builds up to a bloodbath finale.Overall, The King has more strengths than weaknesses. Praise goes out to the supporting cast such as Joel Edgerton. As a plot, it's a slow beginning but worth while if you can push through it. The film's visuals are also enjoyable and solid considering this is now a Netflix exclusive in Australia.6.6/10
Walkden Entertainment"
410,"Another interpretation of William Shakespeare's ""Henry V"" quite modernized starring two of Hollywoods most -in hotthrobes.
The execution is quite good with many epic moments, great production design and costume work. The story itself is interesting however the story telling sometimes a bit slow moving with the tendency to bore the audience a bit.
Performance wise it was convincing most of the time. Timothée Chalemet was as expected very good. Sometimes a bit one toned but skinny Timmy had indeed some memorable moments where he could show off his acting weapons. I also really liked Joel Edgerton. Thomasin McKenzie had an appearance but rather unnoticed and unspectacular.
Robert Pattinson was the weakest part, I can see why he was cast but I found his French accent rather a bit ridiculous and performance wise also not the most convincing stuff he did.
I assume the film could have been a bit shorter and probably had the same or even better effect. Still a good historical epic with many good scenes and a great look and feel in general. Nice atmosphere. Could just have worked a little on the direction and writing."
411,"Quite frankly, long battle sequences is like the most boring thing. And this film basically revolves around a war. But it's not what stays with me after it's over and essentially not really what I think it's about - to me it's more about family. Solitude. Responsibility. I take with me the silence between the lines. The facial expressions. The suppressed emotions. ""The King"" is a slow burning and beautiful film. Timothee Chalamet is brilliant in the leading part and Robert Pattinson has great comical timing in his unexpected role."
412,"I think my eight rating is fair,
Really like the plot and the actor that who is playing the king is brilliant.
The only downside to it I think it's a bit slow at times.Awesome movie recommend."
413,At last a Netfl8x movie worth watching. Keep up the good work I may keep my membership going if this is going to be the standard you make all other films
414,"At 2 and half hours, you barely feel bored. The pacing and the production values all hit the spot. Tight script, great camera work, excellent performances all culminate to make one of the greatest films of 2019."
415,"Truly, the only fault I can find is that it simply felt too short. Despite being over 2 hours long, I couldn't help but wish for more. The acting was spectacular, the cinematography was beautiful, the plot was engaging, and the script was exceedingly well-executed. This was a wonderful performance in every sense. I would recommend it to nearly anyone."
416,"Netflix should aspire to make movies like this -movies with depth and character development, not only fluff and cheap writing."
417,"Perfect. Timothee Chalamet has matured into an excellent actor. He was the reason I decided to watch the film. Very well directed and excellent cinematography. Not an ""Elizabeth"" as the director lacks Shekhar Kapur's gravitas and of course Cate Blanchett has a leg up over Timothee.
But it has been a whirlwind, keeping track of Timothee's exalted ride from one marvelous film to another."
418,"No one can tell the history 100% accurately its proved.
So,if i just take this only as an war movie then it's one of the 5 historical inspiration war movie ever made in my points of view.
No in am not an British, i am from a country whis was once a slave country of The Great Britain's kingdom.So i don't here to support this movie bcoz in this movie British was won the war.
Actually, it's acting, inspirational thinking & decisions for humanity is forced me to write something good about this masterpiece.
Do u can think,an highly Alcoholic & inexperienced boy was the Britain's first most successful king ever by beleiving in another bigger alcoholics decisions.
No extra romantic & sexual scene.
Thousand reasons i can say but can't. Just try this."
419,"Word-wise, it's Shakespeare lite, but producer Brad Pitt's got good taste in movies about manliness, and Timothée Chalamet may be the best actor of his generation. So ""The King"" has heft. If you like manly, muddy, medieval war movies-it's a must-see."
420,"I am not qualified to judge on the historical accuracy, although I am pretty sure the facts diverged from the narration.However, the movie it's quite good in a sort of gritty way. I enjoyed the photography and the battle scene was realistic enough to make you feel the slippery soil, the weight of the armour and the taste of blood.Chalamet as the wayward Hal, soon to be king Henry, was a bit flat in his interpretation. His character didn't emote much and even the would-be ""band of brothers"" speech was hardly inspiring.He was more of a confused boy, prone to bouts of cruelty than an heroic and noble king. And yes, the English really had no business invading France...I liked much more Pattinson as the evil dauphin. His broken English was excellent and hilarious."
421,Enjoyed this movie but just felt like the editing could've been a bit more refined andade it better. Still a pretty enjoyable film.
422,"I have one word for this film: AmazingBut that makes my review to short: so, the sets, the production, the costume design, the musical score, the intensity of the acting. It has all of this and more."
423,"Chalemet, Harris, Edgerton and the music of the film are great"
424,"Amazing shots, beautifil scenes, incredible and brutal fight scenes, masterful soundtrack and great perfomances. The King shares a true (although not that faithful) story about one of the most amazing battles of the 100 year war.Despite the kinda weak and badly edite first half of the movie, the second half is absolute in its resolve and direction.Solid and gritty, my kind of movie."
425,"I didn't even know about england kingdom history untill i watch this movie, and i just find out that the plot was inaccurate to the actual event. But still, i like the way timothee played this main role, being a king who didn't want to shows the superior side is great somehow, even everybody is being rude by mocking his accent and trying to comparing him with another actor, at least he'd been tried and he did great👍"
426,"Normally, Netflix movies suck but this actually had a decent story, good acting and was actually funny. I think Pattinson made the film, which also surprised me. It was a little slow at times but also had really cool battle scenes. All around, it was really entertaining and definitely worth the watch.
Irrelevant side note: Thomas is cuter than Hal?"
427,A strong historic storyline taken partly from Shakespeare's plays and told with dramatic licence and some inacuracies.Nevertheless a very well cast and scripted film with great acting performances all round.The only downsides are continuity and content with some disjointed scenes needing more links and an overwhelming desire for more detail.On the whole a great release from Netflix.
428,First film with Chalamet in it and I have to say I was blown away by this guy. He's gonna be an actor to look forward to in the future. Without him as the main character I don't think this film would've been as good as it is. Pattinson did a good job as well but Chalamet is an actor that I think we will be seeing a lot more of.
429,"Tried to score this 7.8, it is pretty good. Joel Edgerton co wrote and produced this, and Brad Pitt was co producer too, they can be proud of this. Lately these sort of movies have been misses.Even if it was slow once or twice; the script, dialogue, score, (maybe some suspect) fighting, cinematography, I enjoyed the shot of King Henry V in the courtyard when there was a beheading.I'm no historian, just enjoyed a good movie"
430,"If you have a problem with historical inaccuracy, just straight out avoid this film. Having said that, The King is a valid fictitious portrait of actual historic events and lives such as that of Henry V, appreciably portrayed by Timothée Chalamet, in a correct performance that doesn't strike at first but slowly begins to entice. Historical subject matter is dealt with care and attention to details, minus some historical facts which history buffs are not even done complaining about.When I was watching the film, it felt slow and tedious in some moments, unable to grab my attention to its full extent. The pacing can be quite damaging to this film, although it's easy to confuse slow pacing with slow tension-building moments, which are done purposefully to generate impact at certain points in the film.Perhaps you could compare this film with Kenneth Brannagh's 1989 film Henry V, which was adapted from the Shakespeare play, and its dialogue is million miles away from the one in The King, but both portray king Henry V in different manners, in different tones even, with both title performances being up to par. Robert Pattinson's performance is excellent, if there is someone who shines in a role, it is him, without a doubt, and his French accent is delightful.Whether you are into English history or are a fan of Shakespeare's Henry V, you probably won't enjoy much of The King, but you could certainly try if you want to. Otherwise, I think this is a quite enjoyable film, one of Netflix's best productions for sure."
431,"The King was a solid, tense period film over the English/French rivalry from the middle ages. Aussie master David Michôd returns with a gripping portrayal of these dire times, with touches of Shakespeare tongue and brooding drama. It's a tale about honour, family, and the fight for peace over war. With many stories from this turbulent era in history, the film keeps you hoping, but is bittersweet by close...From the opening moments, the film has an unsettling mood that carries the tension throughout, never over erupting but sticking to the very end. It's dark mood is pitch perfect for the era where beheadings were commonplace if you dare go against the King's wishes.Timothée Chalamet as Henry V is outstanding, one of the most promising young actors with this performance here, proving his efforts for the masterpiece Call Me By Your Name were not by chance. Michod & Edgerton on the writing credits again here, backing up the tight script of The Rover (2014) they co-wrote. Not to mention Edgerton acting abilities are on point once more as Henry's best mate on and off the battlefield. Incredible cinematography from Adam Arkapaw that depicts the scale of these battles brilliantly, while showing the intimacy of Henry's life and the decisions he chooses along the path.Considering this a Netflix film, this along with Annihilation proves they can deliver cinematic pieces of cinema worthy of the masterpiece throne. There was no sniffs of it being a Hollywood blockbuster here, with material like Henry V's battle against France would be a money hungry producer's dream to glorify and exploit for the masses to suck up. Instead we have a well paced brooding tense film that is executed with a dirty sword right from the mud pit of the battleground. More of this please...7-8/10"
432,"I must say that i am not aware of the historic events that tha movie depicts. Neverheless the movie was surprisingly good. The acting was good (Pattison not so much), the fighting realistic and all in all a very down to earth but still interesting enough movie to watch."
433,"I found that the cinematography, costumes (chain mail everywhere!), acting and fast-paced and suspenseful plot of The King all combined to produce a satisfying and fairly gripping film.After reading some of the negative reviews, I see that a significant contingent of people are quite angry about the historical inaccuracies. That´s always a problem with fact-based films. There are so many people who believe themselves to know all of the details (I presume because they read a lot of books? Written by other people who read a lot of books?), and they are going to be annoyed at whatever is changed or omitted for the sake of the film and at the behest of the director/writer/producer (in this case, all three are probably complicit). It is true, too, that Shakespeare wrote a very famous play entitled Henry V, and some people appear to be angry that this is not that.My best advice would be to watch this production as an action-adventure film created in the 21st century. Thinking of The King in that way eases some of the quandaries which will surely arise in inquiring minds, such as: why was a young metrosexual male with the body of a pre-pubescent girl cast in the role of Hal? It stretched credulity, to put it mildly, that an adolescent with a toothpick thin body (his torso was displayed naked in more than one scene...) could have prevailed in any hand-to-hand, knife-to-knife battle to the death with such thick-necked, seasoned warriors.Ultimately, The King is a fantasy tale in which a slacker with pacifist leanings eventually undergoes a transformation not unlike that of Michael Corleone in The Godfather."
434,"Toegegeven: Henry IV / V zijn niet de beste stukken van Shakespeare. Prima dat je ze eens in de zoveel jaar afstoft en weer eens probeert. Dat is met mate / gemiddeld gelukt. Henry wordt vrij donker, gepijnigd neergezet door Timothy Chalamet. Hij maakt er het beste van en overtuigt wel als koning tegen wil en dank. Zijn kompaan Fallstaff is een mooie rol die er uitspringt. Goed neergezet. Voor de rest vooral vrij rauwe scènes in een vlakke film vol intriges en verhaallijnen uit de middeleeuwen. Meer van hetzelfde. Gaven geen nieuwe inzichten. Pattison als Franse kroonprins was om te huilen. Volstrekt ongeloofwaardig en tweedimensionaal. Dat was sowieso de afdronk van de film: erg tweedimensionaal. Met Henry en Fallstaff als enige ingekleurde figuren in 3D. Maar dat is best weinig."
435,Timothée Chalamet is excellent in this film as Henry V. He grows into the role before your eyes and by the end you believe him to be every inch the king. The battle of agincourt is expertly filmed but reminded me of the Battle of the Bastards in Game Of Thrones. It is a sober and gritty history piece. If you like historical films you will enjoy this movie.
436,"This was on at the London Film Festival. It is loosely based on fact, though there are three inaccuracies one about Thomas of Clarence , one about Falstaff and the other about the Dauphin of France. but they get the result of the Battle of Agincourt right.
The dialogue attempts to sound slightly Shakespearian but there are various phrases that grate on an English ear like "" lets go visit with Henry IV"" and ""in order to have reform you need regime change"", and a reference to the archbishop tasking.
We saw it with the HOH subtitles and there was a bit where a horse ""nickers"" which I assume is the American or aussie for whinny. The graphics are good- computer generated sailing ships,and a fairytale castle , The sets were shot in Hungary and feel genuinely medieval, costumes, props, battle scenes all done well. The acting is pretty wooden except for the Dauphin- straight out of Blackadder. It takes longer than it needs to to tell the story but its an enjoyable romp through ( somewhat inaccurate) history with plenty of gore and grunting."
437,As the movie is releasing by the streaming giant 'Netflix' so i wish this movie will get lot of money in the box office and i think the story of the movie will also be interesting and fascinating according to the trailer.So you can watch this movie without any kind of tension and the price of the ticket is worth for this movie.
438,Very very good. When it was over I just sat there for a few minutes before I turned it off just thinking about what I had seen. Good Job bringing Henry V to life.
439,"Timothée Chalamet does not disappoint in the lead role. The story was not one I was familiar with, but the script was engaging; press pause for a loo break, didn't want to miss anything..."
440,"This film had high praise and quite good review from various film critics coming from film festivals. So at first glance the film seemed to be filled with a great cast and a promising director. Many of the cast members had proven to show great performances so acting wise I had expectations. However, I felt that Timothèe Chalamet was the wrong choice for Hal. His accent wasn't convincing and didn't feel natural throughout the film. At times you could even hear his American accent which lost the authenticity of the character. Whereas I thought Joel Egerton was very good and provided a good side character that was needed. The standout for me was definitely Robert Pattinson. His french accent was on point and very authentic, at times some of the pronunciations of words didn't seem right but overall was good. My only issue was that the he was in the film for a very short time and didn't show his presence enough. The dialogue was okay for him but there is one joke made by him that evidently was funny but didn't suit the atmosphere of the film and how people would actually talk during the 15th century. I also disliked the way his character eventually dies. And if it is accurate to history then fair. But his death was extremely stupid and removed any prowess that he processed as a character. But his performance saved the character. The script was messy at times and that's shown when a actor writes and script and not a proclaimed screen writer who could have easily elevated the film on many levels. The film was quite long and slow paced. It definitely could have cut down the film by 15-20 minutes. I thought that the cinematography was good and the battle scene at France was excellently made. It felt gritty and historic to how war really was depicted. Chalamet was extremely good in this part showing his excellent training that really paid off. For me the film is being praised and disregarded in the wrong areas. Chalamet is getting positive attention to one of his weaker performances and Pattinson is being overlooked even when he is clearly the standout. The battle scene is being overlooked for being 'too muddy' which is wrong in every sense. Also a true historian wouldn't like this film based on the inaccuracies in the film. But if you are not into history. The inaccuracies won't bother you.
But overall this is a watchable film but not at the standard some people are putting it to be. With better acting choices such as Dacre Montgomery who was also up for the part of Hal would have been the perfect choice based on his audition tape that really showed brilliant acting that Chalamet didn't in show."
441,"A true lesson for every leader. ""Everyone has a kingdom under their eyes "" ... the people you trust can sometimes mislead you"
442,"Created my account to Rate 0 to The King title, but I can't even give 0 rating to this utter waste, I need my 2h & 20min of life BACK!!!"
443,"Total waste of time.
Actors are whack. Lighting sucks. Uninspired story line.
Nothing to save."
444,"All around perfectly pitched performances from the leads and supporting cast. A gritty but balanced view on a pivotal event in history. The cinematography was second to none along with sound design. Chalamet delivered on many levels, both in emphatic moments and quiet intimate scenes, This is one of the best historical action dramas I have ever seen. and I am sure it will the stand the test of repeated viewing"
445,"Timothy Chalamet gave an amazing performance portraying King Henry V, however the stretched duration and a slow paced conversation made this movie wanting less. Alongside Timothy, Joel Edgarton did well and the rest were just fitting enough.The fight scene at the near end of the movie was a good and structured altogether.I will go with 2.5/5 for ""The King"""
446,This film was cerebral and such a fresh breath of air. My hat goes off to the production of this film. Thank you to the cast and crew for making such a masterpiece. I could only hope for more films stuck as this. This is why I will never relinquish my Netflix account.
447,Great quality movie. Love netflix for putting out movies based on these times
448,One of the best historical movies I've ever seen. Attention to detail is unmatched. Great soundtrack. I can't believe this is Netflix.
449,"Great cast, directing, excellent score and most importantly, great job with the script based on the life of Henry the V. Even though is a part of his life, it's the part worth knowing. Just watch it, great escape for two hours and twenty minutes!"
450,"This is not an action flick. This is a dialogue flick that requires the audience to listen and THINK. The movie also requires enormous talent from the actors to deliver the dialogue with the absolute highest authenticity. With the exception of Robert Pattison's accent which cuts into his authenticity, this movie is perfection. Timothy Chalamet is absolutely incredible. I saw this slight, small boy and thought. ""How could he possible inspire leadership."" His acting portrays a MAN in a boys body who commands respect. I've never seen anything like it. I could feel the burden of being 15th century royalty and the conflict between this king's desire to to be good with his need to be strong. Anyone who values a cerebral ""historical"" film will walk away spellbound."
451,They did a great job with this movie. It shows the lengths a man goes through to achieve true power and at the same time tells the story of a young boy and how becomes a true man and fulfills his duty
452,"Love historical movies and series, so I am glad they still make them. This one particularly I found to be watchable, but lacking depth. I didn't feel for any of the characters, although I think the acting was quite good, so it must be the writing and poor character development. It didn't leave me with any emotions after watching it and it probably will be forgotten pretty fast. I was hoping for something like The Outlaw King, which I enjoyed, but I found The King to be slow (too long) and a lot less interesting and exciting."
453,"This was a great movie, and leave it up to Netflix to bring one of the better movies all year to all of us. Bravo Netflix!"
454,"I would like to say, I love it... but for the truth, not really. Till the battle I though Timothee like a child how tried to be a king... his mimics, his ways, not really impress me. In battle finally I see some impressing moments. It was more inaccurate and some scene I think was import from Shakespeare. Robert Pattinson as Dauphin,left me with dual feelings. From one side I laught of his accent and tried to be French and other side I was impressed with his acting skills. Way better than before.
But the ending made me angry. I am not really like Depp's acting and the way she portrayed Catherine of Valois.
And the end, I like more Hiddleston's Henry V better, than this. Timothee is great but Tom's Henry has more potential as a military king as this one."
455,It was great! I personally feel like the movie can have a sequel. It ended with questions.
456,"This is an interesting biopic of King Henry V. It starts when he is a ""playboy"" Prince of Wales. His father did not want him on the throne, but when his brother died, he was it. His rule was methodical and perhaps ahead of its time. The film ends after his war with France.I like the characters in the film. I was thankful they didn't speak with a Shakespearean accent.Guide: F-word. sex. no nudity."
457,"The King (2019) is a historical drama that takes place in the 15th century. It centres on the story of Henry V after he is crowned King of England following the death of his father. The main focus of the film is the battles between England and France. The battle scenes were fantastically Choreographed and the cinematography was, at times, gorgeous. As a big fan of history, I was not disappointed by this film. Robert Pattinson's French accent earns bonus points for The King. Timothée Chalamet was great as Henry V."
458,"9/10 acting
9/10 storyline
10/10 cinematography
Definetely worth a watch, I hope to see more movies such like this from Netflix. Beautiful"
459,"I enjoyed it, but am at a loss as to why they can't make movies about a historical figure more accurate, surely, his short life was fascinating enough not to add in events that never happened. Great cast and acting. It is slow. but absorbing, and some people might find it too slow."
460,"Brooding and understated, The King is a most excellent recent arrival on Netflix. Covering the life of young King Henry the Fifth as he comes to power it is a long and beautiful film full of strong performances.Every scene of this seems carefully crafted and the end result is a feast for your eyes. Even when it came to the main battle, they pull off a fight right up there with The Battle of the Bastards in Game of Thrones. It will make you hold your breath and squirm in your seat as it all unfolds. It was very well executed, and might even be the first time I've seen knights in full suits of armour take to the field in a film.Being a historical story if you are familiar with this part of English history there may not be much here story-wise that is new, but the quality of everything you see on screen makes it well worth your time."
461,"Pros:
The fight choreography was purposefully sloppy, and I felt that added a lot to the film and helped the tone they were trying to create.
Joel Edgerton's performance was solid, and he stole every scene that he was in.
Robert Pattinson and Ben Mendelsohn were nice surprises but were not in the film enough.
The directing was serviceable with no glaring irregularities.Cons:
The film was both too long and underdeveloped. I feel this would have worked better with four, hour long parts to really flesh out the characters and their relationships.
Characters would come and go in the blink of an eye, causing me not to care about any of them.
Timothée Chalamet is a vacuum of charisma and was boring in this film, per usual. The moments where he had to show emotion were jarring and fell flat, mostly due to his character not being fleshed out.
A lot of the film was too dark to make out.
An essentially non-existent score.
The twist at the end explained one of the main red flags of the story but was still unsatisfying.Overall: Soulless and lacking any kind of originality. I admired the world/tone they created but since I didn't care about the characters it was in one ear, out the other."
462,"You generally don't expect Netflix to make good movies but this one's a beautiful exception. Great actors, great script and brilliant cinematography. If you wish to see striking scenes with thought provoking dialogues, this movie is a must watch. Robert Pattinson plays the eccentric Dauphin to perfection and Lily-Rose Depp also did justice to her small role. Chalamet portrayed King Henry effortlessly and makes me wanting more of ""the king"""
463,"I was in awe watching Timothee Chalamet play Henry V, topped with a great cast, setting and ambience. Shakespearian purists and 15th century historians may find it hard to watch, but it's not supposed to be a 100% accurate historical depiction, nor a homage to Shakespeare. It's not listed as a documentary, so I really don't understand the critique. It's entertainment. The script simply threads in a number of historical events and weaves it into a gripping and enjoyable movie. A must-see!"
464,It has absolutely stupid and unlikely ending. King becomes socialist and kind of pacifist right after ordering to execute prisoners. And all of that because French cheek he has never met. Very naive..
465,"Historically Inaccurate even by Shakespeare's standard. The armor Henry wore during the battle of Agincourt reeked of 'we need to show the actor's face'. I mean come on! he has a mail hoodie which he didn't even wear on his head. I do give props though for not using swords as the Knight's main weapon during battle.The acting is good, although Robert Pattinson's french accent really bothered me and I couldn't take it seriously. The story though is different, it bothered me a lot. not just because of its historical inaccuracies but also on how the characters were portrayed. This is not an acting problem because as I have said the actors did well it is more on the directing or writing side of things where this movie fell short. The characters aren't likable and I found it hard to sympathize with them. I don't really want to spoil the movie so I'll just end the review here.so TLDR: You can watch this is you have nothing else to watch but if you have any sort of love for history and the medieval setting then DON'T! you'll just hurt yourself :D"
466,There was a lot more around his early life and French campaign. All felt a bit thin and predictable.
467,"Wow! This is a brave and controversial movie. It takes Shakespeare's Henry IV (in part), Henry V (in part), a pinch (a really tiny pinch) of history and throws it all into a pot. The pot is shaken vigourously and out comes Henry V: The Myth. The timeline is messier than Bohemian Rhapsody - and that was a mess - and the screenplay plays hard and loose with the truth, but the end result is so captivating and so utterly entertaining that I could not help but love it - once I had realised that it had no basis in fact but for a couple of names.
Written by Joel Edgerton and David Michôd, the director, they throw history and the truth out of the window and just go for pure, sincere entertainment. Edgerton, bravely or foolishly, even takes on the icon that is Sir John Falstaff and is triumphant, giving Falstaff the role of glue between king and commoners. His accent wanders and is not historically accurate, but I really didn't care - this was no Russel Crowe as Robin Hood via the Beatles, George Best and Jim Bowen. The performances are, without exception, spot on, but credit goes to Sean Harris as William, Chief Justice (a role inflated greatly from the original) who plays the role with powerful understatement and innate menace, much in the mode of Mark Rylance as Cromwell in Wolfe Hall. It is, dare I say it, almost Oscar-worthy. Also worth noting is Robert Pattinson in his scene-stealing cameo as the Dauphin. He is perfectly accented and suitably cyclothymic in the role and adds a tremendous amount to what could have been a throwaway role. The screenplay did, of course, allow for this, but he really takes it to another level.
I think this is the important lesson to be taken from the film. It is very much a team effort. Nobody hogs the limelight, nobody's ego is on show. The director has presented an ensemble piece that is both intimate and epic. The music provides a sturdy emotional core. The camerawork is as good as it gets. The costumes and production values are given full reign.
I don't like to give films a high score generally because it raises expectations and can lead to an equally strong counter-feeling, but in this case, I will take the risk.
Great film. I think I might buy the Blu-ray when it appears, it's that good."
468,First this movie is over 2 hours of a story that is stretched out much too long. And not one of the characters is even approaching being interesting.Second the cinematography is so dark it should have been recorded in black & white.Third 90% of the actors speak as if they are all coming down with laryngitis!Forth the story in itself is just a bore and I cannot see any public interest in it outside of the people that thrive on Medieval European history.Good luck if you choose to suffer this movie.
469,"This movie was obviously written by an illiterate 5 year old with a crayon, who was interrupted halfway through by his illiterate mother who then fed the child chalk and acorns before repeatedly dropping him out of a 5 story building and then wondering off to blog about why vaccines cause autism. The child then crawled inside and finished writing this god awful movie, thereby inflicting it on the world and literally causing a massive drop in IQ for the whole world.Well done Netflix!"
470,"Wonderful story, excellent writing & extraordinary performance by entire cast! Loved it! Cheers!"
471,"The King is without a doubt one of the best written, directed, acted, and produced pieces of medieval film ever made. The cinematography, productions design, music, casting, costume design, and every other part of this production were top notch. David Michod and Joel Edgerton did a extraordinary job writing this story in such a way that it felt like the characters and dialogue were completely believable. David Michod does a superb job directing both the action and dialogue heavy scenes. I will definitely be seeing all his future directorial efforts.
Timothee Chalamet is phenomenal. I haven't been this impressed with an up and coming actor since I first saw Leonardo DiCaprio. I expect to see big things from him in the future. His character arc from a drunken prince that nobody respected to the well respected king of England is believable and satisfying. Joel Edgerton was excellent as Sir John, friend of Prince Hal. He did an excellent job playing the reluctant warrior. Without him saying a word you could tell had seen his share of war, knew the horrors of it all, and still wanted to fight and sacrifice for his King. One of the few female characters in this film is the wonderful Lily-Rose Depp as Catherine of Valois. She is beautiful, strong willed, and perfectly cast in this role. I absolutely hated the Twilight movies, but Robert Pattinson started to change my mind with his performance with The Lost City of Z, and solidified his position as an outstanding actor in my book with his performance, although brief, as the Dauphin of France. Ben Mendelsohn is in the film only briefly as King Henry the 4th, but he is outstanding as always. He is one of those actors that can make a big splash with only a few scenes.
The Battle of Agincourt is the most realistic medieval battle scene I have ever seen put to film. Usually movies show medieval battles as intricate sword fights and well choreographed battle sequences. The King shows battles like they actually were. The battlefield is filthy, the sides start off organized and soon descend into chaos, and with everyone covered in mud it's hard to tell who is your friend and who is your enemy. This film does a great job in this battle scene showing just how tiring it is to actually fight in armor on a wet battlefield with swords, axes, and hammers. During the siege of Stirling it shows a great depiction of the use of Trebuchet's to pound a fortification into submission. I love Trebuchet's and its not that often you get to see them in use.
Do yourself a favor, if you haven't already, and go watch this movie right now!"
472,"After watching 7.4 average review, I wasn't expecting much from this film, may be that's the main reason I ended up liking it more.The casting is great, specially the young king, loved him in the role. The cinematography looks beautiful, some of you might get annoyed by the tint they used, but for me it worked, fits well for a period drama. I had no idea about this story and regardless about how accurate it is or not, I was invested.It's nothing game of thrones or Vikings but as a film it works fine. The twist which they add at the end that, France never really attacked Hal can be predicted when the assassin just surrenders in the beginning of the movie and tell Hal that he has been sent to kill him. This idea doesn't sell you, But inspite of this suspicion, the movie catches up with Pattinson's character and you kinda forget it for a while and then it's officially revealed at the end that the attack from France never really happened and the ""Good"" king, was corrupted by his own people for their own benefit.The movie has a lot of scenes where the emotions are portrayed with actions over dialogue which I love. Again, my ratings may fall down a notch after some time passes but for now I loved this one. I'd recommend this film to everyone who love period dramas."
473,"This movie is artistically and perfectly crafted.

Editing - 10/10

Audio effects - 10/10

PS: What's up with all the 1/10 votes fot this movie? Oh right, I forgot, maybe this type of voters praise movies that have no artistic values whatsoever and are in absolute need of superhero action or maybe horror movies with screams and irrational events."
474,I was mindblown by how realistic it was. The actors were literally perfect. The makeup and hair was on point. So were the clothes. I think everything was perfect. My only problem with the movie it was too short haha. I hope Timmy and the other great actors'll get the appreciation what they deserve. THIS NEEDS AN OSCAR!!!
475,"The performances of The King was powerful. Especially the entire cast and the performance of Timothée Chalamet, who as an English myself, very willingly convinced and intrigued me with his speech and dialect to every powerful line said. I'm so impressed with the portrayals of the other casts, whom seemed eager and passionate in every scene. I hope it gets the appreciation it deserves, and I am very hopeful of the new generations of cinema in the future in regards to this film.Thank you so much to all the cast and crew members who fought their efforts and wills on this project and piece of cinematic art. Truly a masterpiece."
476,"I love the movie, all cast is incredible, especially Joel. This movie was a great surprise. I didn't expected to be this good."
477,Historically so inaccurate I was waiting for the King to announce he was vegan because he thinks it's cruel to kill animals also it's more environmentally friendly in his opinion.
478,"The best Netflix movie ever!!!....The music,the acting,sets!...all perfect!!,I'll give it 100/100!"
479,"Easily by far the best movie I've seen in a very long time!
Acting was amazing as was the production!
Must see!"
480,"This film was a masterpiece. Every shot could have been a still picture. It has very artistic cinematography, and it was pleasing to watch.The dialogue was engaging, it made following the plot much better. However the plot was a bit all over the place. Needless to say, a nice watch. I would recommend to anyone who likes historical pieces with action."
481,"(Flash Review)Without researching or dwelling on the facts, as many reviewers have complained about, this story is weighty and engaging. An unwilling prince Henry V is thrust by fate to the throne after his younger brother, designated to reign, is killed in battle. Future King Henry V has vision for peace for England while being pressed to take large swathes of land by force by his father's inner circle; namely all of France for starters. When a peaceful approach fails, the new King prepares for battle. Will the outnumbered English be able to defeat France's mature army? When the dust has settled and the blood finished dripping, who can he trust to forge his early reign? The atmosphere is full of darkly lit scenes also devoid of color; muted when used. The story's tone is portrayed serious and gritty with heavy music painting the mood. The acting, editing and production were high quality. Take the story for what it is and it'll be enjoyable."
482,"Hal (Timothée Chalamet), disgraced eldest prince of England, whose disdain for the disingenuous nature of politics has rendered the reluctant heir to the English throne. Hal, having turned his back on royal life, choosing instead to live amongst the people in disgrace, as a philandering outcast. Hal is put in the unenviable position of assuming the English crown despite having tried valiantly to protect his undeserving and unprepared brother whom he presumably loved, and who was favored by his tyrannical father, and birthed the crown. When both his brother and father die, England looks to Hal to be crowned King Henry V. He is then required to embrace the life he had endeavored to escape. This film does a brilliant job of showing the many obstacles the young king must confront. From palace politics and internal betrayals, to chaotic inter-kingdom disputes, the young King Henry must confront the feuds his tyrannical father left behind while balancing the needs of his subjects with the emotional strings his past life have left to him. The relationship with his closest friend and mentor, the now alcoholic knight, John Falstaff (Joel Edgerton) conspires to portray this coming-of-age story of a king at the helm of a kingdom on the brink of war, faced with the daunting challenge of making a name for himself, securing peace for his kingdom, all while remaining true to himself and honoring the virtues he understands to be he and his people's only saving grace. This story is masterfully written and acted. It does a wonderful job of leaving the task of deciphering its ethical conundrums and moral underpinnings to the interpretation of the audience. Wonderfully done, all around."
483,"Very fascinating story considering it's true, I think there are many other things about Henry the 5th that weren't said in the film that are connected to the storyline but I guess it's up to the viewer to do research. Not much action but when there was it was done so very well. Good storyline and very good acting!"
484,I started watching it because I actually thought this was a TV show. I rarely watch movies but decided to give this one a try and it was awesome.
485,"Good story and excellent film
The king was hero to be war and intelligence"
486,"Maybe I am easily impressed, but the growth of the calibre of acting never ceases to amaze me. I was born in Shakespeare county close to Stratford, and I am sure never in his wildest dreams could Shakespeare have imagined that cinematic technology would be able to portray history this way and with such plethora of talented actors. In Shakespeare time, the audiences had to use their own imagination to see the battles. This movie is brilliant."
487,"So I'm not sure how historically accurate this movie is but I can say that Timothee Chalamet truly shines. He really grabs your attention and busts out his acting chops in the first half especially. Acting was good all around!! Going to give a shoutout to the amazingly horrid bowl-cut bangs that were featured throughout. Never did I think I would enjoy loathing a hairstyle so much. Robert Pattinsons wig was swoon worthy and I wish he was in the film more. His insultingly theatrical French accent needed more screen time. I had to keep pausing to do dishes, laundry, etc so it felt very long but that was because I had so many distractions probably. Overall, I really liked this film! I love that Netflix is finally giving us higher quality films with top notch acting!! Give us more!"
488,"Wow, what a stunning film!
Cast - brilliant!
Director - brilliant!
This film was so intense I never wanted it to end!"
489,"I don't care about how accurate the story was. It was entertaining, the acting was good. More like this please Netflix."
490,"As a big budget epic ultimately made for a smaller screen, the lighting balance was bang on - even dark scenes were discernible mid-afternoon in my living room. Additionally, the sound was *excellent*. All dialogue - even the thick accents - was clear and evenly balanced, and I didn't have to adjust the sound wildly to not be deafened by battle scenes or strain to hear TC's Hal's sotto voce tones. The cinematography was great - no pixeated blurring when the camera panned quickly - and the colours looked gorgeous. In short: cinematic production values exceptionally well employed for television viewing. Chalamet & Sean Harris very good. Pattinson hilariously villainous - as intended."
491,"I usually enjoy movies set in this time period, and this one was exceptional. Excellent story, well-acted, and beautifully filmed. I'm not a student of medieval warfare, but this looked like what I imagine such battles would look like, with the men actually tiring and fighting with everything they had. Highly recommend even if kings and knights aren't your thing."
492,"Just caught this today on Netflix. As an English major, I am well versed in Shakespeare's Henry V and the films by Olivier and Branaugh. As an 'armchair historian', I am familiar with the historical battle of Agincourt, particularly the account by the late John Keegan, a renowned British military historian. The location of the films battlefield resembles the actual site which is important. The problems of the French mounted and knights on foot had with bog conditions and the crush of people is accurate.The film does borrow from Shakespeare in a couple of inaccuracies for the sake of the story.
1. Henry and Hotspur as contemporaries. Nope Henry Percy, Hotspur, was roughly 15 years older;
2. Single Combat with Hotspur. Nope, the Battle of Shrewsbury was an actual bloody battle where Hotspur died.
3. Falstaff, A beer once brewed in St. Louis but not an actual personI did like how they tied in the issues of the legitimacy as Henry IV, aka dear old dad had usurped Richard II and was constantly challenged by other nobles."
493,"The only place I found fault with The King, was the cinematography. For me, it was often too dark, which muted the detail from many a critical scene. Otherwise, The King was a well done and a complete epic drama, one I most assiduously enjoyed."
494,"It's not Henry V and it's not a documentary of the events leading up to the Battle of Agincourt. Judge it on its own merits.
Personally, I liked it a lot. It's dark, it's not a fast burn. The acting and script aren't flamboyant but rather sparse and conservative.
I could have lived without the ye olde pre-battle speech although it did let lead actor Timothee Chalamet off his leash for a second which was nice.
The battle sequences are lumbering and brutal - probably a lot more realistic than a lot of the ballet productions used in many period pieces.
The supporting cast I thought was great. Joel Edgerton is transitioning into an elder statesman-like period and this role is a great start. Robert Pattinson is the only real disappointment in a brief but pivotal role as the Dauphin. His accent and blonde dye-job compete for the worst bits about his performance but the whole thing lacked the chicanery and arrogance I think he was aiming for.
I think Netflix has done a good job. The movie worked great for me at home but it's also cinematic enough to render well on the big screen."
495,I enjoyed this film I like period pieces. Good acting realistic fighting all around i enjoyed as a movie watcher. Now i can't speak on its historical accuracy but for all the reviewers trashing the film based off this I'm going to have to give their review a not helpful. Dont bash the history of the film the entire time then give me no suggestion on a accurate film. Provide a solution please I'd like to learn.
496,"Where do I begin? This movie was incredibly slow and boring, which is crazy since most of it involved battle. The lighting was terrible, the acting was only ok. There was a lot of fiction in this movie, that really didn't add any greatness to it at all, so it defeated the purpose and left us with this garbage. Don't waste your time."
497,This Movie Could Have Been Done Much Better It Was Very Painful To Watch From The Bad Fighting Scenes To the Terrible Robert Pattinson French Accent Should Have Been Done In Half The Time and Very Boring !!!!!!!!!
498,Great story telling. Outstanding performance by Mr. Chalamet. Well done!
499,"The story in this film needs to be exactly like this to appeal to the masses. It caught my attention, so now I have actually started to read more about the history of the U.K.
Great movie and actors. And I would say that the lighting artist makes exceptional good use of the natural lighting in this piece of art. At times, almost like a renaissance painting.Please dear Netflix. Continue giving us these masterpiece surprises."
500,"The story is slow paced, but the acting is great and the scenematic scenes alone are fantastic!"
501,Thank you netflix for this film. timothee chalamet is on his way to become the new dicaprio.
502,"I liked this movie a lot. Watched it to see how Timothee had done and I ended being quite surprised. It's technically a war movie, but war is of little importance in it, it was only the necessary end that the plot was asking for. But the movie is much more than that: it's about what it means to become a man, to ""come of age"" in its literal sense, to be free, to not let yourself be carried from life any longer and truly start to make decisions, to be conscious (of yourself and of life, of finitude, mortality). It's a ""slow"" movie compared to what we usually have today, but it had to be to say something besides thrilling and drama and plot twists. The director did very well, there's always present the detach of Hal from the others, his (supposed) coming of age, his detach from the life he led: above war and drama, that's what the director was going to: show him detached from the rest, from whatever is in front of him, and not left there lost in the middle of life, and he did that very well. Timothee's put a very good performance: he shows confusion, determination yet still grieve: a mix of expressions that do not fit a king but yet fit very well what he is in the movie.
His dialogue with Lily rose Depp is the moral of the story: after all, he never detached from his old life, he still wasn't free, he was still moved by grief, played by life. And only in the end does he show that he understood what is needed to become a man, to stop being young.
The script is quite good, never too clear, almost always just on point, saying what it needs to be said for the public to understand.
Congratulations Netflix for another good movie."
503,I had high expectations going into it and it exceeded all of my expectations. While it can be slow in some parts the action scenes and ending make up for it.
504,Looks great and acting is superb but it's just kinda boring. Historically inaccurate movies usually mean overloads of action but not this one. I wish I knew what I was getting myself into before starting it. Don't expect braveheart. It's a lot of nothing with lots of dialogue. The slow build up to the finale was an even bigger letdown.
505,"There is a lot of positives regarding this film. The acting, sets, costumes, and locations are superb. It is undoubtedly worth a viewing. However, one should not watch this and feel that they are informed of this period of the Hundred Years' War, as it is historically inaccurate... Which then begs the question, again with these types of films that are based loosely on history; why not simply make a thoroughly fictional film inspired by real events and state as much - though in this case it isn't nearly as historically inaccurate as Mary Queen of Scots was as that film was turned into a modern activist or social statement film based on falsities and fantasy."
506,"Ironic the treatment that this is getting by so many, considering everybody was bashing Mary Queen of Scots for being historically inaccurate - for all the same reasons. At least they were obvious about it and didn't try to hide it like this one, which only people reading up on it will figure out. It is quite wrong, to the point where it's weird they wouldn't straight up say ""inspired by real events"" or ""inspired by Shakespeare's fictional works"" because a lot of important plot points and characters are fiction, and the general audience won't even find out.
But I do suspect that the intense fanbase of the actors starring in The King, is much to blame for the many glowing reviews. Netflix' best? Try Roma, The Irishman (even though it came out shortly after this one to be fair), Mudbound, even Okja. I swear, they got more heart and realness, and don't rely almost solely on the popularity of the cast and the epic movie sets. That is just not good enough - not for history, nor for storytelling."
507,"Amazing drama, i can understand the mixed reviews on this because of its historical inaccuracy, but overall its a pretty good movie with over the top performances like the one for Henry V intelligently given to Timothée Chalamet, loved the costume design on the film and absolutely loved the whole tragedy that this movie delivers."
508,"I found it a bit inaccurate and very slow that becomes dull at some times. For a Netflix movie, it was good, but nothing remarkable as a movie referred to history."
509,"Normally I don't really like this kind of movie but I really enjoyed The King. Timothee Chalamet is an amazing young actor who was incredible as King Henry V. I never really liked Joel Edgerton but he was good as Henry's only friend and confidant, Falstaff. I'm ashamed to admit I was a huge Twilight fan (Team Edward) so I was anxious to see Robert Pattinson as the Prince of France and he excelled my expectations. Lily-Rose Depp (Princess of France & Henry's wife) only appeared for a bit at the end but she was noteworthy and I look forward to watching her in the future."
510,"#TheKing is a surprisingly effective film, full of great performances. Chalamet is as good as expected he is the king of the year, but it's Joel Edgerton who (almost) steals the show. It showcases what hatred does to someone built for good. It's long (and slow), but it kept me engaged throughout."
511,"A very underestimated movie with fight scenes that go beyond. Braveheart was great for popcorn fans. But if I ever believed a movie about young kings, lords and legends dying. This is it. Watch. Enjoy. Remember kings were not all grey and wise. They started young and naive. Amazing."
512,"Many reviewers have complained about the historical inaccuracies of this film. That's a legitimate criticism, but i am watching and judging this movie independent of the historical constraints. If you want to see a movie about the details of King Henry V's ascension to the throne of England and the battle of Agincourt, you may be better served by a documentary.The King is a well written, well directed, well produced, well acted and thoroughly engaging film that i think should be judged on its own merits.Joel Edgerton co-wrote and also starred as the superbly likable Falstaff. Quite an accomplishment.The transition of Hal from drunken lech to wise and unflappable King Henry was probably a bit fast, but it hardly detracts from the credibility of the character or the plot line. A testament probably to both the writing and to the strong performance of Timothee Chalamet.I even found myself liking Robert Pattinson who played the obnoxious Dauphin.Sean Harris is a unique character actor who rarely disappoints and his portrayal as William is riveting.The King has a high level of quality violence but not in major quantity and certainly not used in such a way to dominate the entertainment value of the film.If this ensemble of writers/director/actors/producers decide to collaborate again, i'll be lining up to experience the result."
513,"I wasn't sure about watching this at first. But, Wow! Just wow! So glad I decided to give it a chance. Excellent movie! Unusually easy to follow period movie. Very heartfelt and moving. Superb acting by all, especially by Chalamet. Love this movie!"
514,"I'm truly satisfied, an absolute masterpiece, I liked every thing about it, the music, the story, the actors, and spatially the main actor who played King Henri, young boy but a true talent.
My only complaint is that there was less details in the story, come on it's about King Henri!!
Anyway as I said I'm very satisfied, it was a pleasure to watch the movie."
515,"The cinematography is great but the acting takes the cake, very strong by most actors and I'll be sure to check Chalamet's movies.
Unfortunately it could have been put to much better use had the writing been more subtle, maybe the writers could have taken their time to reflect on Shakespeare's writing, who knows, maybe they even did. Henry's drive and ambitions could have been much deeper than merely the maturing of young rebellion.
Without getting into spoilers, Catherine's scene could have been dealt a lot better and given real depth to her, much of what she said could have been acted out instead, as would befit such a conversation, and such a time."
516,"When I read this entire story about Henry V and his won battles in France (Link at the end). It pretty much sumns up what I just watched for 2 hours and 20mins. So to ppl giving this 5 stars or less, lol. You guys should get YOUR stories straight, before acting nonsense in here."
517,"If you like medieval war movies with a bunch of drama check this one out, the movie is not afraid to show you how war is like it's brutal and I liked it I'll say just give this movie a chance it deserves more, also the movie ends very sudden left me wanting more I could have swear the next episode was going to start that's why I give it a nine out of 10 I wish there was more"
518,"Worth watching. Decent movie. Interesting story.
...."
519,"Everything about the movie was very close to the History books. The acting exceeded my expectations. Robert Pattinson has always been a great actor, but with this movie he has completely convinced me on the potential he has. Timothée Chalamet was also very convincing overall the director did a marvelous job"
520,"I don't really have the words to say just how surprised I was by this film. It is a story cinematically told, but the way the screenplay really honed in on the human drive - that minutia - behind great and ghastly events really sat well with me.So often people resign themselves into tacitly accepting great convoluted conspiracy theories about machiavellian machinations operating in deep states and so on and so forth.What people often fail to grasp or what we underestimate is the power of individual self interest and how the desire of one person can drive entire nations into darkness or light.Worthy work by all involved. Mine is a wholehearted recommendation. Watch it for many good reasons but mostly watch it because it's worthy of your time and consideration. I think this one will stand the test of time."
521,Enjoyed this film and wanted more but sadly it had to end.
522,"The King is historical drama and film and I'm enjoy this film while watching. The most important and special things in The King film is Historical battles scenes, all actors strong performance, and amazing cinematography.
The King is must watch film for every historical drama and thriller movie lover."
523,"What a great piece of film making. My only issue is that I find it hard to see into the mind of the king and he seems at best remote and distant - it's hard to see what drives him, despite a beautiful performance in the lead role.A lovely film, a brutal film, an honest film that makes the world of Shakespeare acceasible to all.I can only hope one day to write something so wonderful"
524,"Just WOW!!!!! What a movie. Great story, great D.O.P, everything is just great. Above all the monster in this movie is the music... Worth the expectations and worth the wait"
525,"This film is immaculate, and can be really appreciated if focus is pushed away from its historical accuracy. The film highlights how in medieval times power really was portrayed as the key to happiness, and to be a worthy man, you must have power. For me it was fascinating to see the character of Henry V develop and what power and pressure can do to someone. How his original morals were left behind, along with any emotions of fear and grief, otherwise it would defy how men were supposed to be. Sure it ignores historical facts, yet in that it achieves multiple character lines that are much more impactful, giving the film itself real substance and worth. loved it"
526,"Dispite this movie is rather fiction than Biography things, we have to agree that its was a good movie. Great acting, great characters, PERFECT WRITING (Oh God I was tear up cause its so poetic), and the battle scene was trully epic (yeah, I know its GOT reference). So, for you who not the historical fanatic, its really recommended for you.I really waiting this movie to come to the theater in my country."
527,"When together, Chalamet and Edgerton steel scenes, and the fighting sequences are glorious in their own right; however this adaptation of Shakespeare's classic proves too slow a burn, and lacks much emotional engagement, leading us through a story as muddled and unhinged as its titular character."
528,"Wonderful movie, editing, acting, photography. Who cares about accuracy, it's a work of fiction, not an essay!!!"
529,"A beautifullly shot and directed movie, with incredible cinematography, acting, and atmosphere, and quite honestly, one of the best films of the year so far, it's depressingly realistic, and cinematically gorgeous at the same time, I loved this movie.."
530,"Thanks Netflix, I enjoyed this movie. Kinda boring in the beginning but overall, perfect movie."
531,"Beautifully shot by the extremely talented cinematographer Adam Arkapaw & with a surprisingly evocative score which literally gave me goosebumps during certain sequences (courtesy of Nicholas Britell), ""The King"" looks & sounds incredibly impressive, additionally boasting numerous effective & understated performances from recognisable household name actors - most notably from lead Timothée Chalamet who is simply magnetic on screen...But unfortunately, none of this compensates for the noticeable missed opportunities; multiple important events occur off screen & the plot is progressed through verbal exposition instead of visibly depicting the story as it unfolds, immediately breaking the ""show, don't tell"" golden rule of filmmaking. Hence, scenes are disjointed, often misconnected & incoherently constructed; giving a sense as though the feature was condensed & edited mercilessly until what must've been a 4 hour runtime was sliced to 140 minutes.Dialogue is clunky, verbose & regularly provides the impression rewrites were required in order to perfect & streamline the narrative before shooting; after witnessing ""Boy Erased"", the main culprit for this error would be Joel Edgerton - who is continually proving himself to be unfit for helming the scripting process.Questionable directorial decisions are made too: for instance, providing a character with a distracting lisp... Tonally, in such a brooding & atmospheric piece, a comical pronunciation felt out of place.It's a good film... Not remarkable. There was potential for it to be - but that was unfortunately never realised."
532,"I am usually quite hesitant when choosing what to watch on Netflix, in particular their films due to their melodramatic and corny narratives. After watching the trailer for The King, I thought id give it a go. Thoroughly enjoyed Timothee Chalamet's performance as the King, and felt that the cinematography is the best yet produces by Netflix's own brand. Highly recommend."
533,Great storyline! Great battle scene! And an even better ending!!!
534,"Well what can I say? The movie was great, though slow at times, wich is okay for me since it was reasonably long. The main battle was very nicely filmed and was really immersive as far as my personal opinion goes. The soundtrack was great and the little plot twist at the end completed the story in a nice way. Overall it was nicely written, they didn't go into detail too much with the characters (because they didnt have to). Acting was great as far as im concerned. Might be the best Netflix movie out to date. Great flick!"
535,You'd be hard pressed to find anything wrong this movie. I watched it on Netflix. The battle scenes are hard hitting as are the relatires of being a 'King' so young.
536,"The King (3.5 out of 5 stars).The King is a pretty fair historical drama film about King Henry IV of England. About a story when Henry gives his distant son Hal (Timothy Chalamet) the role of being king after his passing. Hal was always a drunk and distant son which Henry preferred his other younger son. Hal trying to correct the conflict that his father has left behind. He receives an insulting message from France. And an assassin sent by the French King. Which Hal prepares for war with the French.The plot is entertaining and worth watching if you care for historical dramas. Especially the story and setting taking place in the 15th century. The script and direction may be a little too long or prolonged in the second act of the movie. Which made it slow and boring in some parts.The acting is great with the performances by Timothy Chalamet as Hal. Joel Edgerton playing Falstaff, Hal's best friend and advisor. Sean Harris playing William, Hal's advisor. Ben Mendelsohn as the ill King Henry. And Robert Pattinson playing the Dauphin, the French King's son. Pattinson's performance as a French prince with the accent was something different.The direction of the historical drama is worth watching. The story behind King Henry's son Hal and his rise to ruling England and making it a peaceful place was good. There will be some slow parts which the film could have used some editing some scenes to help with the pace.The battle sequence is decent. It was a bit confusing with the chaotic battle with both armies crowding in. Making the characters feel claustrophobic and buried underneath the bodies.Overall, The King is a pretty fair film. The plot is good. The performances are great. And the direction is decent. The film suffers from weak pacing and prolonged scenes but it delivered telling this epic tale of these characters."
537,"I love that it's more realistic than most films like this. One example is the first fight scene, but warriors are tired quickly which is a reality if you imagine them in gear like that fighting.I do wish it was more historically accurate but they never claim in the film that any of it was."
538,"This movie has fine touch and nice approach towards it's story, but at the end I wasn't as satisfied as I thought I would be. Timothée's cool and stuff, but he seemed like he wasn't giving his best, for what I'm hoping for to see in Dune, giving him a chance again. Only few things I liked about this movie, like catapult's effect and especially knight's armour, because it was so real and showed it's heaviness if you're the one to wear it. Acting was poorly executed and Robert did no more than others. Whole movie you're waiting for that last battle, 'till it happens - you're just bored or offline already. Perfect modern example how'd you make a movie like this, is ""The Outlaw King"". Give this movie a chance if you are fan of swords and stuff... or just don't."
539,"Inexperienced actor, novice production, not too much expectation from Netflix."
540,"What a brilliant film! The acting was A plus with great character development. This film had a little bit of a BBC flare to it. That is a compliment, the BBC is far above any others when it comes to cinematography and storytelling. This film for sure had the likes of the Gladiator, which is a classic! The King, a must watch!"
541,"Wow! no agenda stuff. no politics. just a well written, well acted film beautifully shot. I am not a history buff but this seemed authentic. awards should flow"
542,"Ok, let's state first that this is not an wholly accurate historical film, in fact, the accuracy of the portrayal of Henry V and his contemporaries is at times way off the mark, as are those of the events portrayed, however, as a history based drama and cinematic experience this is outstandingly good. All of the elements here, storyline, script, acting, scale and production values combine to make a powerful gripping and truly Impressive film, perhaps a modern take on the historic epic genre. It blew me away on first viewing. A great movie (well done Netflix!). One of the best of 2019."
543,"It's a modern English Language movie of the 5th Henry King of England. It is well acted, enacted & scripted. It left me wanting more from this superb cast who work well together, with 'No Blondes' stealing the limelight. The story follows the 'teen' prince & his failures and then as the crowned King & his victories.This is a much better version than 1989 Kenneth Branagh movie 'Henry V', that is based on the same King Henry 5, but because of copyrights/licences/permissions/red tape etc, 'The King' cannot be labelled an 'adaptation' of the original source & is not a 'remake' of any original movie that came before. Therefore it is 'loosely based' on 'several' of William Shakespeare's fan based or fun based - ie: 'fantasy' 'history plays'. Because the two movies are based on the same king anything you don't understand in one movie you can use the other to clarify. Like I never understood why two guys were singled out to have their heads chopped off. In 'Henry V' it was three guys but the reasons were clearer when I watched 'Henry V'.My concern is for the numerous unnecessary loss of life over a 'misunderstanding', egged on by those who have an eye on their own kingdoms, as forewarned by King Henry's sister, Queen of Denmark.What I like about this period in history is that the Kings & Queens of old, did themselves participate in whatever battles or wars that ensued. They didn't just send out their cavalry or entourage of soldiers, supporters or village people. Can you imagine Queen Elizabeth 2 in her younger days with whatever weaponry was used to fight 'The Falklands War' or whatever war you can think of?"
544,"I will not be talking much about historical accuracy because I honestly don't think it matters. It's a film not a documentary. Going into this film I had little idea of what it was about and its historical context, so I will be judging it as an average viewer.Simply put: it could have been better. And in my opinion it deserved better.The events of the story are just too great and too long to be confined to a movie. A better mode of story-telling would have been a series.I would have loved to see more of Henry's rivalry with his father. There was only about 10 minutes total of them on screen together. More talk of battle tactics would have also added to the awe, and why exactly you can't just go around a medieval castle to attack. The ending is especially the weakest point. So the king of France is a madman who believes he's made of glass, and you only show him for 3 minutes and it's not even a good 3 minutes? Besides that, the movie makes it look like taking over France was quite the piece of cake that only took a month. I also felt that Gascoigne's death was really underwhelming and hypocritical. No blood on screen then while we had to watch the brutal beheading of another character that barely mattered.And being that everything had to be confined to a movie, a lot of great historical events that would have made an even greater story had to be cut out. Such as the time when Henry fought against France at age 16 and got an arrow to the face where new medical tools had to be created to pull it out. In general the theme of having to go to war at such a young age was ignored in the film. Then again I'm not sure what age Henry is supposed to be in the movie, because he was 26 when he became king.Also, maybe it's just the style of the movie, but the colours are so dull. It is a misconception that everything was just black, grey and brown in the medieval period, especially in what people chose to wear.Anyway, I'll just keep dreaming about a series of this."
545,I am definitely convinced by chalamet acting and found the movie extremely captivating. Robert Pattison fake french accent was the only thing I couldn't handle.
546,"It's rare to get films of this quality, it was VERY good. The battles were probably the most realistic I imagine they were like. The sword fights were fought my people, not superhero's."
547,"Thoroughly enjoyed this film end to end. Its most notable successes include Nicholas Bretel's evocative score and it's eloquent screenplay which manages to strike a perfect balance of Jacobean language that doesn't fall into the hole of over-romanticized drivel.Excellent cinematography befitting the film's gritty themes of war and honour and wonderfully introspective performances from its stars.My only quarrel is the lack of female characters (other than Lily Rose Depp's fierce portrayal of Catherine of Valois). Though understandable due to the time period, I feel that with the abundance of artistic licenses taken with this story, the writers could have afforded to include more significant female figures (of which there were no shortage in the Plantagenet era)."
548,"I don't know how to feel about The King. On one hand, it's legitimately impressive how Netflix pulled this off. On the other, it's quite a mediocre film when you think about it. It doesn't say anything particularly interesting and does very little to distinguish itself from other historical epics. Oddly, it feels quite small scale at times and almost lazy (did they have the English siege a castle for like 15 mins to avoid spending money?). I think the performances are fine, but the film is a bit unimaginative."
549,I enjoyed the movie while watching it. But in the middle i realized that i will forget the movie. The best thing about the movie are the actors even if none of them had their best role. Every other aspect of this movie is solide but isn't really unique .The plot is fine except the ending because the little twist at the end is unnecessary for the plot. The cinematography is good and there are some good looking moments in this movie. The editing is solide even though there are some cuts that fell out of context.Now to the big proplem of this movie: It isn't unique. If there weren't all these young star actors and you would show me a scene of this movie i wouldn't be able to recognize it.Watch it if you want but you don't have to.
550,"I missed enjoying historical movies. This film reminded me why.This one, in particular, presents a page of history with a young European King (England's Henrik the 5th), along with the common treasons, friends, foes (that specific game at the court); war isn't missing either (with a version of the battle of Agincourt) and the music is set just right (sumptuous, grave, sublime).To finish this review with a quote, I underline what one of the movie's heroes said: ""A king has no friends, just followers and foes.""."
551,"As soon as I put this movie on I thought WTF am I watching in the first 10-20 mins? then ...OMG ! this movie is absolutely brilliant well acted. How much is based on true events i don't know? but now I want to know more about King Henry IV. This movie is absolutely brilliant. I really enjoyed it and to be honest I really didn't see that coming. If you're reading this, don't judge the movie in the first 20mins. Let's just say it's a slow burner."
552,"The King is another middle age war story, that's impressing visually, but offers nothing new to the table. These types of movies that Netflix are producing are becoming a lot more common, but Netflix is doing nothing to make them stand out. The King and Outlaw King have different plots, but both feel the same to me. They're alright when it comes to the screenplay, and they both have amazing visuals and war scenes; I've already forgotten most of Outlaw King, and since The King is so similar, I think this movie is just going to slip out of my memory in about a year.The screenplay is a major factor as to why this movie is so forgettable; there's nothing to talk about, it's simply plain. They should've put more into it and make it more unique, even if it makes The King not true to history. The way the characters were written felt really lazy. Why does Hal hate war so much and try to avoid it? Why does Hal not want to be king even though he doesn't want his father in charge? What battle did Falstaff take part in and why is he in such a good friendship with Hal? It's like all the characters were written to feel or be something but without reason. The screenplay in general is lazy, and the runtime is over two hours, I think they could've put in a lot more to improve the characters.The acting was great, but the way Timothée Chalamet acted Hal felt cold and emotionless most of the time. Timothée Chalamet probably had to act Hal in that way, but it does the character no justice. If Hal was acted more in a compassionate human way, then I might've cared if Hal would die or not. In fact, since all the characters are so one dimensional, if they all died, I would wouldn't care at all.The best part are the visuals, battles, and music, which is what holds up The King from getting a rating that is lower than a five. The visuals is what you'd expect from a Netflix film; it has stunning cinematography and excellent filming locations. The action is realistic and I like how they mention the fact that fighting in full knight armor is going to tire you out quickly. The music is my favorite part; it's sad and droopy which adds to the entire mood of the film.The King is pretty much standard in the genre and it's not going to be memorable in the years to come. The acting and aesthetics can only go so far when the screenplay adds no context to any of the characters. The King is not a bad movie, but it's not a necessary watch, just watch it without any high expectations."
553,"Well written, well acted but I am sorry I would have liked at least 3 battle scenes."
554,"It is totally opposite to its predecessors, the Olivier and Branagh versions of Shakespeare's Henry V. In The King, there is no majesty or nobility, neither in kingship nor in war. Collaborators Joel Edgerton and David Michod give their film strong anti-war and anti-monarchy sentiments, re-imagining the literary tradition in an unflattering way.The pace is slow and the decor stark, drained of colour and vitality, without any pretense to rousing historical spectacle. Most of what occurs seems little more than drudgery -- the drudgery of office, of diplomacy, of battle. Even in speech, long pauses between lines make it seem that even to articulate a thought requires effort, and talk is a kind of drudgery in itself.The odd, deliberate miscasting of Timothee Chalamet gives the soldier-king a
rather startling effect. He isn't given many dramatic high points, but we still keep watching Timothee's pallid Henry in his various predicaments. He is enigmatic, even compelling sometimes, a misplaced boy-king stumbling through history.The King has a cold, Nordic look, maybe like a Carl Dreyer film. We expect Falstaff (Joel Edgerton) to enliven the general spirit, but the famous buffoon here is merely a dry advisor to the king. Any lightening of mood comes from Robert Pattinson as a clumsy, loony Dauphin of France, and Lily-Rose Depp as the insightful and superior Princess Catharine.The Battle of Agincourt itself is a superb mud-bowl, with armoured knights clashing blindly at one another, filmed in sharp lines and grey tones like a medieval etching.In its own fashion, The King is engrossing, maybe even once in a while a bit exciting. If the film's intent is to depict a cheerless, unheroic age, it does so well enough. As a dark meditation on royalty and militarism the film more or less succeeds on its own terms."
555,"This show is reaally boring for me personally, i couldnt get past 52 minutes, its too slow and boring for people around 20"
556,Timothée Chalamet is becoming the best living actor. Amazing film.
557,"Compelling from the start, it will keep you hooked to the very end. Beautifully shot and with performances that have you feeling for each and every character. This is simply stand out."
558,"Its a very well made film. The story, characters and cinematography is woven magnificently. Don't compare this movie to this and that done in the past including Shakespeare. It stands on its one and is a fresh take on Henry V and his legacy."
559,"It's clear after watching this movie that Timothée Chalamet is going to have a bright future. I just wish that someday he is going to work under the direction of Danny Boyle, because he just fit Boyle's style perfectly. The movie in general is decent enough to be nominated for an Oscar (Best Picture), but it's not going to be the one winning unfortunately. The acting is awesome overall, especially Robert Pattinson's Frenchy apparence and Ben Mendelsohn Kingy's one. In conclusion, a movie that I recommend it to everyone."
560,"If you want a great, entertaining movie, watch The King. It may be inaccurate, however, it is a film, and an absolutely amazing one, at that. Though littered with inaccuracies, the film is nothing short of a landmark in showing realistic battle from the 15th century. In my opinion, people need to stop rating something this well made, so low just because they have a personal vendetta against historical inaccuracies. Most movies would be boring, if not made different than the actual story. It keeps us captivated. Then after, if you are interested in the history, go and read for yourself, but until then, shut up and enjoy a very VERY well made film about the battle of Agincourt."
561,"My only regret is that I watched The King on a 52"" TV. This is most definitely an epic movie deserving of ""the big screen""! The writing was flawless, directing was deft and meaningful, and the acting transported me. I wanted to know these characters personally. Still do! Movies like this from Netflix should really shake up old notions of what is Oscar ""worthy""."
562,"A well acted, superbly directed historical drama with a compelling script. Lavishly shot with gut-churning battle sequences. A must for medieval period buffs."
563,If you enjoy a more genuine historical film then this should hit the spot. From the costumes and linguistics to the nature of fighting and negotiation this aims for a realistic feel and let's the truth in the battle of agincourt create it's drama without trying to force any.
564,"Gritty, mind blowing, real! The King is a must see, not like other self important same story line medieval movies of the past. Visuals are amazing, storyline that isn't boring, the acting is phenomenal. You feel apart of it from beginning to end.I just couldn't tear my eyes away."
565,"Deeply moving and enticing story depicting history and legends. I found it most entertaining, with an excellent cast."
566,"Intelligent script, brilliant acting, perfect locations, - deserves a cartloads of Oscars."
567,"I may be biased because I'm so sick of the current state of movie industry in 2019. Major production companies stick with prequel, sequel and all these safe bet for financial guarantee. On the other hand, Netflix is making Oscar worthy contenders such as Marriage Stories, Irishman and The King. And the general movie industry are treating them unfairly due to lack of screen time in theaters. That's the definition of discrimination.
Back to the movie, I'm only a regular movie fan so I'm not qualified enough to claim this's a Oscar worthy or not but the story line is solid with memorable twist. The acting from Timothy is fantastic and he deserves at least a nomination for the role. He has been completely transformed from a dreamy, good looking type cast to a deeply thoughful and troubled man. I believe such transformation of acting requires dedication and research."
568,"After the first watch, ive seen that there more to this film than meets the eye. After 6th watch i can say this maybe is the best movie ive ever seen. And ive seen a lot. So what was so great? Acting? Plot? Screenwriting? Answer is everything. Everyting in this picture is flawless. I recommend you watch this movie twice, because you might not be able to absorb its beauty in the first watch. Second time you will see how genious is Timothée Chalamet as Henry V. And all other actors. Every sentence in this movie is in its place. Music is played throughout the picture, and it steers a heart. I must mention Sean Harris and his genious attribution to this masterpiece.
I mostly measure greatness of the movie by how it stucks with you after watching it. This movie is stuck in my mind days and days after watching it, and i think it will stay with me for a long time. ALL HAIL KING HENRY!"
569,"I stopped watching this movie after 20 minutes, Zero charisma, very mellow acting that makes you wanna go sleeping."
570,"I really enjoyed this , so did my wife . No expectations at all and it was fantastic.Robert Pattison is scary good! Wow"
571,"This was recommended to me on netflix and i found it was a great way to waste time, yes i think it's good that netflix are putting money into films like these, the costumes were great and so was the cinematography but a lot of the time i was bored since it moves quite slow"
572,"I fell in love with this movie and would have rated it with 9 or even 10 stars...if I wasn't that caught in the plot and googled about the King and his victory.
The story, just as mentioned in other reviews, is just loosely based in historical facts. There is lots and lots of fiction. But damn, the movie is catchy!
My advice: Enjoy for what it really is, pure entertainment. For history lesson try wikipedia."
573,"It was family entertaining to watch - i like the score, Battle scenes and fighting ok. Not a fan of casting Cedric as a french prince his accent sucked!As for the history - think most people who know it will easily pick it apart!"
574,This film looked great and had some amazing performances but I just dont feel like it reached it's full potential I think if they should more of Henry's life it would've been better and more entertained and would also give a lot more character development
575,"What a snooze, and what a somnolent slog through the Henriad. Of the eight Shakespeare plays on which this movie is based, I really only liked ""Richard III"" (and actually took a class in undergrad solely on that play). I generally know the material fairly well, and I love historical dramas like this, but everything about it was so dull and leaden, and nearly all of it missed the mark, that you'll need to be a major Timothée Chalamet fan to sit through it. Robert Pattinson's French accent is ridiculous, and he's on screen for maybe five minutes, but Joel Edgerton, who co-wrote the film, is great as always. This isn't worth your time unless you really want to see a hot young Hollywood star sporting a snazzy bowl haircut and galumphing through the mud in a few well done battle scenes."
576,"The main attractive of this movie is the cast, and the lot of advertising that Netflix gave it made me want to check this out.
The one scene that did fascinated me was one of the last ones, where Catherine shows up and revealed Hal that everyone was lying to him. That is what this movie needed and a lot of it but we didn't get it.
It's fair to say is slow paced and kind of lacking an actual plot development.
I usually hate Netflix movies but this one is not that bad, they sure have a lot to improve though."
577,"Truly i loved the film, i don't have a moment when i want to turn off it when i mostly have on other movies when i wach it on computer. Great scenes, great battle an great story telling, i don't care if it historicaly unacurate, because most movie is. But this one have a point like most others dont have. If you love history movies with great batlles you must wach it and that's it."
578,"I see a couple of review that said it wasn't fully tell the true history. well, idk the og story was so im gonna say this. this movie was fill with a reall good performance from the actor. really good. the fact that they dont really have many events that occurred feel like nothing because how good all the role are. love the set, they do pretty total to it.and i think i might be good if this one have a sequel ."
579,"The film itself contains amazing scenes, a great battle, it actually takes armor seriously and blades dont just slice thru plate like butter, i love the soundtrack and overall had a great time watching.
BUT, however, the historical accuracy, while being very horrible, should not be the main point of view when reviewing the movie, as it has been for some people who rated the movie with a 2 or lower.I would highly recommend watching, but no, it is not historically accurate, nor do i think it is trying to be."
580,"Didn't know what to expect and captivated from start to finish. It never felt grandiose, but delivered big on performances, script, scene-setting, and storyline. Forget historical fact and just enjoy a great little BIG movie 😎"
581,Thats a great movie....no doubt.... But Pattinson/ Edward special apearence worries me.... Weak and same old acts by him
582,I had no big expectations when I started to watch. It was a Netflix movie after all. They didnt get higher in the first half hour or so. First I thought this is yet another movie about millennials sort of traveling back in time to make it right. But for some reason I stayed on and surprised me. Not much action but well acted and a good story with a decent dialog.
583,"R.Pattinson seems to be carried his acting talent to a whole different level.
And Joel Edgerton is the coolest as expected."
584,Blew me away. This newcomer Chalamet. What a force.
585,"This will probably be the best costume drama of the year as it has the atmosphere, costumes and the sets that makes a great medieval movie. It's so believable, just visually stunning to experience and look at. It's also one of the most realistic medieval movies I've seen, the fight choreography was just brutal and real which made me sit on the edge of my seat as it was unpredictable and not the regular sword fights, it was something special. What also made it realistic was the musical score as it wasn't really any music at all but when there were music, it was really epic and powerful. Another thing which I noticed was the natural lighting that was used. Some people may find that a negative thing, see the Game of Thrones episode but it works here as it is a historical medieval drama, where there only were these kind lightning so what we see in front of us is natural lightning and a lot of darkness which also goes for the dark nature of the film. Costumes, props and the sets were some of the best things of the movie, for example just seeing the historical accurate armor that the actors wore was just an amazing feeling as it was one of those childhood fantasies and it is justified in how it's portrayed, clumsy but effective. The battle we get to experience is something I was expecting after watching through the movie, true mayhem of nothing other than blood and death, that whole sequence was just magnificent. How the last sequence of the battle was shot in one take made it so much better and realistic, superb choreography.David Michôd did it again with his dark visual story telling with his spectacular directing and crew behind him, the cinematography is just stunning, wow. The script is great, a lot of dialogue which makes it really slow paced but it works if you take the time to see the artistic cinematography behind it all. I believe you have to re-watch the movie to get all the details as there's so much detail in each scene, just the wide shots are just incredible. The script which is written by David Michôd and Joel Edgerton who also stars and produced the movie. I only have positive things to say about the script but the dialogue could have been more Medieval and what I mean is the profanity in it, other than that nothing else. This story is nothing that I have never seen before, it's amazing and sorts of breaks the old Hollywood way of making medieval movies. It's a beautiful thing.The ensemble cast all does a great job, an excellent job at that but there is a couple of them that stands out. Timothée Chalamet plays the title character, King Henry V. His performance is so strong that I would be rooting for a Oscar nomination, it was superb as I found it as great acting but also doing the character justice of the real life counterpart and Shakespeare proud. Joel Edgerton is the other actor I want to praise, I got this feeling that his character wasn't needed in the beginning but I was wrong as his character and performance makes the movie, the inspiration and help he gives to Henry V and the chemistry Joel and Timothée has is amazing. To the third and final actor I want to write about, Robert Pattinson. It was a really good performance but the thing everyone have talked about is his accent and it's bad but I think I know it is bad, through dialogue and character sake. The character dislikes England and mocks them with speaking with such bad English, it can be that? Who knows, it was laughable either way. Otherwise a good performance! This was seriously a really good movie, an epic one at that and one that is far from others in one way. Perhaps one of the best historical medieval movies I've seen. A coming of age story of Henrik V from his father's death to his adventure in France, a story worth told and executed perfectly."
586,"I originally had this down as a 7/10 film..and then I did some research. Bad move! Turns out old Henry wasn't a pacifist at all. He was a 'hack em all down' type of guy. Also, a lot of the one to one fights never happened in real life and Sir John Falstaff is a fictional character who is mentioned in four plays by William Shakespeare. Ok! So, basically, they made most of it up! Anyway, that said, it's an enjoyable film. It's written well, acted and directed well. The film held my attention and drew me into the story. 6.5/10"
587,"I knew nothing about the film more than some noise during his run through festivals, so I decided to watch it and it was a marvelous surprise. I know it's not really historical accurate, but I don't mind, because it gives you a wonderful story that's really rounded from start to finish.Everything is superb in the movie, Story, Direction, Photography, Acting, Music...and I just want to point that this kind of acting is something not usual on this kind of movies, I guess that's why some people is giving bad reviews. But if you enjoy the cinema outside hollywood, that's not fast paced and tries to go deep inside the being while the story is driven by the actor, this is your kind of movie.If you expect an action movie with a lot of fake fights with FX this is not what you'll find here. How the actors and director creates tension on every fight is worth some study, they are slow and clunky but they really work.About the acting,they try to give a lot of weight and substance using silence at their favour, all of them act this way except Robert Pattison that plays the opposite, being gross with a funny accent that helps to give some contrast in the movie. I really don't get why people is doing memes about this, when is totally intended and well executed.More than that, and without wanting to do spoilers, the way Henry goes from start and how it close the story at the end is super nice to me, he though life was easy but we all know it's not.Have fun watching it :)"
588,"GRADE: B-THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A powerful battle scene and Timothée Chalamet's fine performance does not an epic make.JIM'S REVIEW: It isn't easy being king, especially if you don't want the job. But duty calls, and Henry, Prince of Wales, or Hal to his friends, must fulfill his destiny in David Michôd's historical drama, The King. The film is given the royal treatment with good production design, panoramic vistas, and lavish period costumes, with special mention to Nicholas Britell's elegant music score which elevates the film's pedigree to nearly epic stature. Yet, despite all of the filmmakers' noble quest for accuracy, the final result is a bit of a prodding melodrama lacking a strong narrative, compelling characters, and any real excitement.Timothée Chalamet has the title role as the unlikely king and this young and talented actor adds another thoughtful and convincing portrayal to his fine repertoire. As his loyal friend and mentor Falstaff, Joel Edgerton plays his character with no humor and a far too serious edginess but Sean Harris has some nice moments as the scheming William Gascoigne. Robert Pattinson is Hal's chief nemesis, the Dauphin of France, and he entertains in his few scenes, but his borderline campy buffoonish interpretation and thick French accent just does not gel with the serious trappings and undercuts the conflict and the character's needed menacing nature.Still, Mr. Michôd directs with authority and he crafts his film with much flourish. But his screenplay, coauthored by Mr. Edgerton, gets bogged down in too much historical details, politics, and court intrigue while failing to establish well-drawn characters and interesting dialog. Everyone talks in dry expositional conversations with no genuine emotional heft. Everyone pouts and stares. Everyone broods excessively. But then, is anyone ever happy in the 15th century?As the battle lines are drawn between King Henry V of England and King Charles IV of France, the film starts to build some interest, especially in its very well-staged mud-soaked action sequence of The Battle of Agincourt, but this overall thrilling effect comes a little too late.(And let's face it, Mr. Chalamet's rousing pep-talk on the battlefield, sans Shakespeare's prose, pales by comparison.)The King strives for greatness but settles for conventional storytelling with just a tinge of mediocrity."
589,"Its a very good story to watch!
The only bad thing about this movie, is his time and sometimes you got bored, but this little prob isnt so much bad
I recommended it to who it may concern"
590,"Timothee Chalamet is spectacular as the King in this. It did a good job showcasing the grim reality of medieval times, the Battle of Agincourt, the intrigues of the Palace Court and the burden of a King to rule a country."
591,"This is a bit of a tough one. Part of me wishes to sing this movies' praises as a gripping tale, well told. It certainly is that. That said, the movie is completely a-historical. This just isn't, at all, how these events went down. It makes me wonder how we would judge a movie that simply, in a straightforward manner, portrayed WWI with Germans winning. That would be kind of weird... right?! As such I'm going to give it a compromise 7. As a more overt piece of historical fiction, I would give a 9 or 10. But given this drapes itself in a historical gloss, I'm subtracting points.Now I get those reviewers who will reply that this movie does not bill itself as a documentary... but historical quibbles aren't the issue here. This movie just makes stuff wholesale. You might as well call the king Jason the V, or Fred the V... I could say more, but you have probably gathered my point by now, this movie really pushes the boundaries of narrative ""liberties"" in the service of relating a historical event a bit too far, I felt."
592,"I've just finished watching this, never wrote a review before, but this movie is incredible was unsure on the casting at the start but Jesus Christ I was wrong, very wrong... what an actor Joel edgerton is, blew me away... can't say enough good things about it... it's beautifully shot. And just transformed me into the movie, I was almost about to write I would loved to watch 10 hours straight like a season, but no it's just perfect as it is.... round of a plause for the effort put into this, contender for best movie I've seen ! Bravo"
593,A movie about war that is so incredibly boring and If I date say so a little bit rasist
594,Who cares about the historical inaccuracies? The story was well done and the battle was real.
595,Netflix continues to get English history right. Everything was en period. The Battle of Agincourt sequences were the most realistically violent cuts in cinematic history. Timothee Chalamet delivers a career-high performance. The ending is so surreal it is still in my mind hours later. I will definitely watch again. The best film I've seen on Netflix in 3 years as a subscriber.
596,"Absolutely loved it. Excellent acting, excellent battle scenes and full of plots and excitement. A must for people who love these type of movies."
597,"If you are a cultivated person and have read history or Shakespeare this picture will hurt your intellect. This is a picture created for Homers Simpson who like war movies, blood and violence."
598,"The mood, acting and musical score of this film is excellent - but is totally spoilt and undermined by its complete and utter lack of historical accuracy and more importantly the lack of any clear disclaimer explaining this.There will be individuals who will watch this film in the belief that it reflects the historical fact surrounding Henry V, his life and accomplishments when in fact it does nothing if the sort."
599,Don't waste your time with this movie. Many things not true in this movie. If you are going to rewrite history at least make it entertaining.
600,"Such a great movie that you'll enjoy for sure, an amazing plot and an incredible performance by timothée chalamet, all the actors played their roles very effectively, i wish netflix makes a season 2 out of it to tell more of the king henry's story starring timothée. for the medieval movies fans you will wish it never ends."
601,It's the one of the best films ever i love it and the music is amazing
602,Good acting and armosphere but the story is really boring! cut the movie to 1h 30min
603,"It seems the only negative reviews are in regards to the films historical inaccuracies, which personally I couldn't care less about. The film is very slow and one note almost the entire way through. It takes over an hour for the film to really pick up any pace. And when it does, it isn't exactly that engaging. That being said, the acting and cinematography are excellent - albeit a cringey performance from Pattinson. It's really a shame that the story was lacking. I would say it's worth a watch but don't expect much action or excitement, which is what I had first anticipated. Instead be more prepared for lots of conversations and dreary violins."
604,"Acting dreadful, plot didn't resemble any Shakespeare I've read and the battle scene was comically inaccurate."
605,"Despite having quite an interesting topic,I feel like the film wasn't made properly. Quite long scenes without anything really happening. Except never ending dialogues, naturally...The one and only scene worth seeing is the one at the end where you can see armies fighting. And that's all,I guess. So,unless you like history, English kings, and long conversations, don't watch this movie. Or, if you want, give it a try and see for yourself."
606,"One reviewer wrote ""it's hard to fault it.""Really? Not at all.It's a fictionalized account of one of the most celebrated battles in English history - Agincourt - and of one of England's most celebrated kings, Henry V.This film is slightly more botched than Dunkirk and more insane than 1917. All were botched ""historical"" films.On a positive note, at least Hollywood got ""Midway"" right."
607,"A great disappointment for Shakespeare fans, but a greater disappointment for any one with some knowledge of history, especially of military history. There are so many mistakes, that it would take longer time to cite them here than watching the movie.The movie succeeds in almost getting everything wrong regarding the battle of Agincourt, if they have studied the battle, then they have failed to understand the dynamics and what determined the outcome.The story of Henry V was so full of mistakes, misunderstandings and misconceptions that most fake news of too day, seems true.The cinematography was good, the actors were also decent, but the story was truly horrible, what a waste of potential."
608,"This film is gorgeously filmed, gritty, and haunting as DRAMA. Unfortunately, it suffers much of the same historical inaccuracies that plague many recent films of its genre.
Much has already been said about the goofs in the staging of the battle at Agincourt, and I won't bother to reiterate those.
What I find much worse is the casting and characterization of both King Henrys, and Catherine of Valois. Thimothée Chalomet gives a wonderful turn as Henry V- as he would have been at least 7-10 years BEFORE Agincourt. At the time of the battle, Henry V was 24 - NOT a boy, especially in those times. But issues with Catherine are worse. She was 15 YEARS younger than Henry, and casting and characterizing her as his contemporary is a ludicrous as the casting of Catherine of Aragon and Henry VIII in ""The Tudors"" - but that's a separate gripe. And Catherine of Valois was a royal princess trained from birth to prepare for and accept her role in the Royal Marriage Game. No matter how she felt about her husband, she would NEVER have spoken to him as was depicted in The King, ESPECIALLY given the difference in their REAL ages. A) she would have known better and b) he would not have tolerated such words from her. Henry V was notorious for his insensitivity and intolerance for criticism. All the contextual errors means that that final, touching scene where Catherine and Henry ""get each other"" is probably even MORE inaccurate than the omission of the stakes in the ground that protected the archers in the REAL battle of Agincourt. Oh, and Ben Mendelsohn is tragically wasted as Henry IV. Mendelsohn is fine talent, but his mumbling and lurking beneath filthy hair do no justice to either the role or the actor."
609,"Th first half of the movie was very slow (justifiable), the second half felt rushed. It appears to be a low budget film and that showed in terms of battles, sets and choice of actors.
Acting was mostly decent and battle(s) gritty but I was left with a feeling like somebody removed the plate before I finished the meal."
610,A strong performance from Chalamet elevates what could have probably been a dull and mundane film.
611,"Absolutely beautifully shot and edited, The King delivers in tone and story with an outstanding support cast and a reserved but commanding performance in young lead timothee chalamet.Joel Edgerton shines through, while the performance of Robert Pattinson regrettably comes through slightly forced and affected.The King manages to subvert expectations of the genre and does not rely on narrative crutches such as romance or revenge; and while not a historically accurate film, presents its story in an incredibly real 'warts and all' setting.While a long sit for the casual viewer, the filler material feels welcome if not necessary to at least showcase the talent of the cast and crew to full effect, and does not feel boring at any stage.A must see and potential genre classic."
612,"Yes, the king is a film that knows how to tell the story of King Enrique in a good way, has a good story, a good script and a very good direction of photography, the performances are good and the story does not lose thread as it progresses . The king is undoubtedly a demonstration that Netflix can make good movies."
613,"As many reviews have already noted, this film takes liberties to historical accuracy like a knife to butter. A hot knife through room temperature butter. (i.e. Thomas was never considered as an heir in lieu of Henry, both boys were experienced soldiers by their late teens, and Henry's ""party boy"" years were a literary flourish by William Shakespeare - historical documents show he was consistently involved in war and politics since youth. He was also not one to shy away from war and his marriage to Catherine of Valois was considered/negotiated when they were very young, in part to give him legitimacy/acknowledge his right to the French throne. He was also 6' 3"", but perhaps that's nitpicking. Battles were also inaccurate: Hotspur was actually 23 years older than Henry, who was only 16 when Hotspur was killed at the Battle of Shrewsbury at the age of 39; the one-on-one battle never happened, being yet another invention of Shakespeare's. Finally, the Dauphin, Louis, Duke of Guyenne, was not present at the Battle of Agincourt.)So, we'll continue as if this was a period/historical drama inspired by real people (except the fictional Falstaff) and real... er... general events. Again, said by other reviewers, this movie had so much potential but for some reason was forced into a 2hr + film format; a damn shame considering it was on the perfect platform for any other alternative. Characters were underdeveloped to the point that I didn't care about them. Henry's sister, Queen Phillippa of Denmark and Princess Catherine of Valois, his future wife, each had only one scene of dialogue; the bar hostess had more screen time/character development than two of the most important/influential women in the film. It's not just the ladies - Henry's father, who he did have a difficult relationship with, was not given enough opportunity to show their troubled relationship, making the deathbed scene was unmoving. Henry's cousin, 3rd Earl of Cambridge, who he says was ""like an older brother"" to him, is beheaded after telling Gascoigne he accepted a surprise meeting with a French agent... and I kind of didn't feel anything. All these characters needed much more screen time for us to feel like they mattered, for us to be invested, and for us to relate/sympathize with Henry after their betrayal. It should have been easy... in real life/actual history, he and Sir Thomas Grey were executed for an actual conspiracy again Henry, known as the Southampton Plot. There was also a third guy - but let's not bite off more than we can chew. The only character I felt for was Falstaff... the only fictional character in the movie. I know I echo the sentiments of other reviewers, here and other places on the 'net, but this should have been a mini-series. If it were structured/presented in ""acts"" (each titled ambiguously like ""The Rise"", ""The Plot"", ""The Betrayal""...or something) then it would hint/hearken to Shakespeare and all these historical inaccuracies would/could be ignored/explained. Finally, I had a problem with the accents - something I feel would have been fixed with a miniseries, considering the caliber/abilites of the cast. Pattinson and Chalamet slip up noticeably several times, to the point where it interrupted my viewing. Pattinson might have had an easier time, considering that with Chalamet, it was not only pronunciation, but also cadence - he pauses/takes breaths/speeds through parts of sentences in the way American speakers do. It was most apparent in his private conversation scene with Lily-Rose Depp (who did a lovely job, by the way) near the end of the movie; several entire sentences are delivered in an American accent; it also doesn't help that he's the only American in the main cast and Chapman, who plays his younger brother Thomas, is actually British. In any case, I think both actors would have been fully able to deliver more convincing accents if given more time, i.e. a mini-series.All in all, the acting was great, the script felt natural and unforced, the cinematography and speed reminded me a bit of Macbeth (2015) and The Lost City of Z (2016), both of which I enjoyed. Not a waste of time, but not as good as I had hoped/as advertised - definitely a missed opportunity."
614,"What if schoolboys rule the world? Surely it's no different from when schoolgirls rule the world. Isn't it in school that seniority determines who's to say what's to happen? Or isn't that at least what the seniors mean to teach the juniors? Isn't that what the student nestors mean to teach the newly initiated student?Wisdom and impulsivity in practice are largely born to the person, although even the youngest that will be wise can be a little mischievous, but only require one fair spoken word to mend their ways. Do onto others and won't they be allowed to do onto you? Any little scoundrel can teach you that, even when they aren't called Kant.The story is an honest portrayal of the infidelities of the mind of those in power, sometimes led astray by those that seek power but not more than advantageous position. The King meant to break with the former King, his father's ways and seek peace. The King meant to leave the people be. The King meant for the people to enjoy the spoils of life and was no stranger to them himself.Why fight even though there's plenty of room to live? Why fight taking your people to war lest they suffer famine they hadn't suffered, had you not taken them to war? The wisdom resides in some young, some old, some men, some women, in none that favor a position of power. We love, stay healthy, and work, and choose to take care of all of our worries rather than create them.We should allow ourselves to do this and we shouldn't allow ourselves to be thwarted in our intentions and motivations as long as they are good. Great movie to illustrate that. Honest portrayal. Honest ending, both good and bad."
615,A tremendously well-played act! And this I say as a medievalist who normally is very sceptical about movies on medieval times.
616,"""The King"" is an entertaining movie which offers great costumes, battle scenes and effects. However, it's quite forgettable and mediocre when it comes to the plot, its development and the characters -an issue that also plagues ""Outlaw King"" (2016), Netflix's previous try on the Middle Ages.The creators of ""The King"" just couldn't decide what they wanted the movie to be. Shakespeare or history? An oppressed protagonist, belittled by all, or a fearful warrior ready to lead his country? Falstaff, the coward, or Falstof, the brave? Joel attempts to make a blend out of these options, but the result is utterly unsatisfying.Let's elaborate a bit. A movie on Henry V. It won't include St. Crispin's Day speech, won't depict Falstaff accurately, won't spit archaic terms and witty humor profusely and won't glorify the English cause. Sorry, mate -Shakespeare knows thee not.We can't argue ""The King"" aims for historical accuracy, either. Many reviewers have outlined in good detail the blatant twists poor dame History has suffered on the hands of wicked and gloomy Joel and his companions.Of course, the movie never claims to be a recitation of the Henriad (we already have ""The Hollow Crown"" for that purpose) or a dramatization of the actual life of Henry V (such an intent would better fit a documentary or a mini-series). Indeed, movies are supposed to be creative, thrilling and impactful; deliver quick, but powerful messages; surprise the viewer most acquainted with its underlying story.Now, ""The King"" has none of these qualities. It's a dull piece about a ruler, somewhere in the world, fighting a national war, pressed by the sword of Damocles -one of the most overused plots in cinema history. It's riddled with clichés and cheesy dialogues which disrespect the talented cast here assembled, so badly wasted.Speaking of the cast, again we contemplate the creators' indecisiveness. They're evidently unsure as to who is their protagonist. At first he's a pacific, unserious scoundrel, repealed by his father's warmongering nature. Crowned, he's despised by followers and foes, for his young likeness. Suddenly, however, he becomes grave; a ruthless patriot; a cold and virtuous despot; a Netflix-sponsored music video of Sabaton's ""Carolus Rex"".Yes, I understand that's called ""coming-of-age drama"". That he's fooled in the end, as an epitome of the blind masculine ambition. But everything is too fast, too unsubtle, too unconvincing.Now, contrary to some, I wouldn't say the director miscasted the main role. It's just that it lacks verisimilitude, which is paramount in a movie of such serious atmosphere. When they cast Chalamet, creators evidently want us to expect him to overcome hardships with a cunning mind or a strategist spirit. But what we see is the very opposite: they make him prove his mettle in the battlecore, in duels, in the mud.I'm sorry, Joel, but as you yourself said, Chalamet isn't that guy. Next time, invert his role with Pattinson's."
617,"Not alot happens in this film but that doesn,t matter all too soon its over great acting great costumes all in all how films should be no explosions hollywood blah blah blah just an immersive believable experience with a basis in fact"
618,I'm gonna be short about this. Character development not so great. Scenes were too dark and for a movie this long it surely felt like a half an hour full of ****.
619,"I love this movie it takes our patience at first.Iam teenager,so it is a historical learn for me and I was connected the movie very well."
620,"UM ÓTIMO FILME HISTÓRICO SOBRE A SAGA DO REI HENRIQUE V DA INGLATERRA, QUE TERMINOU A Guerra dos 100 anos DIZIMANDO O EXÉRCITO FRANCÊS NA Batalha de Azincourt, COM DIREITO A POLÍTICA E BELÍSSIMAS (E SANGRENTAS) BATALHAS MEDIEVAIS!!!TEM BATALHA!!!

621,"The King looked promising but after the first hour I was greatly disappointed by the poor quality of the scripting and dialogue. Some scenes are completely improvised.Other than that it appears to have been made without a purpose, the characters are very vague and they don't develop and aren't interesting. It left me looking for a good reason for watching it. I had almost fallen asleep after the first half and then I just quit watching it entirely.I'm not a fan of the main actor either. That might just be the reason why a film which consists of showing his face or the lack of facial impressions for 140 minutes can be just too much to take for a demanding old fool like me."
622,"The acting was very good and the Battle scenes are Very good, while there are some liberties in the story it is still a great depiction of late medieval England"
623,"I was surprised by Chalamet, i didn't expect that he could be a Shakespearian character but he could and impressed me. He carries this film on his shoulders. But Pattinson was like a parody of a French chef, he was a like character if Saturday Night Live."
624,"I very much enjoyed this film.
However, I consider this a costume drama rather than historical drama, since there are many inacuracies that don't really attribute anything to the story.
Also, I was somewhat disappointed wirh the battle in this film.
Though exelently filmed, the tactics shown were simply wrong."
625,"Intense, vivid and credible!
One of the best from Netflix.
Helped me overcome the disappointment I felt after watching The Irishman"
626,"""The king"" is a good movie about the youthness of Henry V, especially the period just before he became king and the first war against France. It is interesting to follow the change of his personality after having inherited the crown, due to power, fear, responsability, enemies and the difficulty to trust in someone.
It is also an important moment in the history of England, although unfortunately Henry V is not much told by movies or books. One more reason to appreciate this work."
627,"This turned out to be a pretty impressive movie, but then again, any film about Henry V that happens to have Falstaff in it is going to grab my attention. However, I should point out that this is only based on Shakespeare, this is not a rendition of any of the Shakesperian plays that centre around Henry V. The first thing is that Falstaff, at least in Shakespeare, doesn't go to France with Henry, and secondly the language in this film is somewhat more modern that what one generally gets with Shakespeare.The main focus of the film is the events that lead up to the battle of Agincourt, though at the beginning we are introduced to Hal as being the hard drinking, carousing, prince that we all know him as from the Henry IV plays. However, Falstaff, while being his good friend, is actually much more level headed, and much less of a buffoon in this film. In fact, as I mentioned, he travels with Henry over to France, as his personal advisor, much to the disdain of many in the court.There is a lot of political maneuvering in this film, particularly with Henry IV initially disinheriting Hal, but later being forced to accept him as king due to the death of his other son (and his other son basically died due to stupidity). However, a lot of the focus is the preparation, and the invasion, of France. As I mentioned, there is a lot of political maneauverings here, and it appears that the French are actually attempting to goad Henry into action, though it turns out that there is a lot more going on behind the scenes.One interesting thing in the film is how the battle of Agincourt played out. Look, I'm not entirely sure if the battle was actually filmed at Agincourt, because it certainly didn't look like it, but then again much of where the battle was fought has been turned into fields. Yet, in part it didn't seem like it went on for too long, and it certainly didn't feel as if there was a huge number of soldiers participating either. Personally, maybe that had something to do with budget constraints. Yet, the thing about the muddy ground, and the English using that to their advantage, certainly does add to the realism.Yeah, this turned out to be pretty cool film, and there was a lot of realism about it as well. It is certainly worth checking out."
628,"A story with strong points about things like leadership, who a leader can trust and family relations, where a lot turns on the line ""uneasy lies the head that wears the crown"".Some points are heavy-handed and somewhat clichéed, where the longs cuts and overdramatized, long looks of the actors don't help, while others are handled with more depth.However, it has very little to do with biography, when you compare it to the historical knowledge we have of Henry V, his personality and the unfolding of the events it covers.They have told their own story drawing on a well-known historical figure and famous plays, which is fine, but biography is a mislabel."
629,"The King follows Henry V from his drunken antics as a prince through to his first victory in France. Of course first thing's first with this kind of movie; it's exactly that, a movie. This is not a documentary. It's a piece of thrilling entertainment based just as much on Shakespeare's play than it is on actual historical records. To treat it as anything other than that would simply be unfair to the film's intent. There's a lot in here that isn't accurate, such as the plot behind the scenes, or the strategies used at the Battle of Agincourt. But on the flipside there's a lot here that does feel authentic, and I feel like it struck the right balance between fictional entertainment and brutal realism.The movie can feel slow at times, as long stretches of time can go by without anything bombastic happening. The first hour of the movie follows Henry as a prince, resisting the crown and seeking solace in his own brand of peace, before being thrust into leadership after a dying father. While slow, I didn't mind this section much because it took the time to really establish Henry's character and his borderline pacifist nature. It gave him trauma and motivation in an abusive father, and laid the stage for the French campaign. It's not until halfway into the movie that the French campaign even begins, and even then it's a slow start thanks to a castle siege depicted as slow and uneventful as a castle siege would really be. It all culminates in the Battle of Agincourt and the French surrender, leaving ten to fifteen minutes for a coda at the end, complete with story-defining plot twist. Pacing is not this movie's strongest suit, that's for sure, but for me it never dragged and kept my attention throughout.Arguably The King's most visceral aspect would be its battles and fights. While the Battle of Agincourt lacks the historical accuracy of the strategies utilised, it worked because the focus was put on the press in the muddy field, complete with claustrophobia and brutal, ugly brawling. In many ways it felt reminiscent of the Battle of the Bastards in Game of Thrones, which is certainly no complaint. When charged by a vanguard of cavalry, the hero of the battle doesn't casually step aside and carve the horse in half, dismounting its rider. Instead the horse crashes into the line and the hero is catapulted off his feet into the line of men behind him. Similarly Henry's challenge early on starts out like knights in shining armour, but a sword fight quickly becomes a wrestling brawl on the ground, clanking armour plates, and exhausted breathing from both parties. Even the siege in its uneventful presentation still felt surprisingly visceral as three trebuchets launch flaming projectiles into the castle day and night, and the looming threat of hunger and disease is never forgotten.Another aspect in The King's favour lies in its pure acting talent. I didn't always dig it as sometimes it felt like certain actors were taking the film too seriously, begging for awards with gravely whispers erupting into dominating shouts, but that's honestly not much of a criticism. Hey actors, how dare you take your craft seriously and put out great performances! Timothée Chalamet was the worst offender for this, but he pulls off the role of Henry V so well, balancing the tender desire for peace with the anger and authority required to be a strong leader. His portrayal was definitely full of layers worthy of dissection. Ben Mendelsohn chewed up his small runtime the only way he can, Sean Harris played the advisor William with as much ingenuity as required, Joel Edgerton was the perfect best friend, tired soldier, and wise mentor. And then there's Robert Pattinson who took his role as The Dauphin as seriously as was necessary and had fun sinking into the role of a slimey, privileged villain. His French accent was not authentic at all, but deliberately so, mocking Henry and the English and insulting their language.The third big plus for The King comes from Nicholas Britell's domineering score as it sweeps high and low and keeps the plodding pace of the movie moving ever forward. It embraces the medieval setting with authentic-sounding instrumentation and composition, while also maintaining a brooding string section throughout. It is equal parts melancholic and bombastic, changing as required without losing its uniform tonal quality that brings the whole film together. Similarly Adam Arkapaw's cinematography once again proves he deserves to be up there with Deakins and Hoytema. Every shot is oozing with artistic merit worthy of being framed, and the Battle of Agincourt wouldn't have been nearly as spectacular to watch without his eye behind it. For me his most successful shots lie in the more subdued and tender moments, framing a solder against a sunset, or the montage of trebuchets in the siege, or the decidedly muted colour pallet in the royal courts.The King has some big problems, mostly in pacing, historical accuracy, and mumbling line delivery, but when it does something right, it goes the extra mile. Chalamet is great as Henry V, offering us an interesting character to follow and sink our teeth into, the battles and action scenes feel true to realism despite how inaccurate they might be, focussing on both the thrill and monotony of war and not hiding from the brutality of either, and in almost all technical regardless I don't have a single complaint. I give The King a good 7/10, pushing up the higher end to an 8, but not quite topping the crest.https://qyrosmovies.blogspot.com/"
630,"The movie was great if feel like the history of the England also have dark scene like the joker also so tell that "" the king has no friend only but the king has his followers or his servants.......................""the story was also great because so how the young han v have great knowledge of war"
631,Even as an American the blatant historical inaccuracies were bothersome. The film isn't necessarily to blame since it's centered around Shakespeare's plays and not facts (although we're heading further away from fact).If you go into this movie just wanting to be entertained then you will be quite happy with it. Do not however watch this movie in the hope that you'll get a history lesson because you'll be either sorely disappointed or ignorant.
632,"This film has managed to hit all the right notes perfectly. From casting to acting to costume design and beautiful cinematography. I never felt bored even once. War scenes were shot in one of the most natural and believable ways. I'm not sure about the facts but the premise and story itself is told in a very true to life and relatable way. You get to experience the emotions of the protagonist from his initial scenes till the end, masterfully performed by Timothee Chalamet. Netflix should invest in these kind of creative endeavors more! The quality of this movie has set a high bar for Netflix. Must watch!"
633,"The set, the writing, the script - all brilliant. The movie is kind of slow. However, the acting is really captivating. I was really impressed."
634,"First Henry was not a wayward son. He had a falling out if I remember but not to the point this movie portrays. I cannot properly find the words to explain more, but the movie thinks more of itself than it deserves. Yes Henry was a good king as we look back on this time and yes Agincourt was a very important battle for the English and our current way of life. Also the interaction between Henry and the french girl (whose name I forget now) is ridiculous and frankly unrealistic. These things are Hollywoodisms I understand but this is a movie about actual people and events. Why make them fake? There are enough lies already."
635,"Opening scene
""that wind you feel is coming from England""

""Scotland is that way""
Points opposite direction of smoke seen blowing behind him"
636,"If you love Game of Thrones and you are the kind of person who proudly says that historical movies are movies, man, not documentaries, you are going to love this.If you know about the period and about shakespeare you are going to cringe. It may bother you so much you won't enjoy the film, and the film is enetertaining and well made. It's possible too that you are able to suspend your belief and just take it as it is. Up to you.I would have preferred if the king was a fantasy one, maybe a King of the north, and the Dauphin the heir of the throne of westeros or something. I understand that to make a film you need to tweak timelines and sometimes merge characters or make up ones but this is re writing history to suit the sensibilities of the present time, and that feels a little dishonest to me.At least there was no anachronistic gender fluidity.It's a very good film nevertheless, I enjoyed it."
637,"First of all, I think a lot of Netflix historical efforts get short shrift. I have enjoyed Marco Polo, Medici, and even the Troy series which many people on  voted down. Outlaw King was an enjoyable yarn if a bit heavy on tropes we've seen too many times. All of them I had no problem finishing, however, this film from David Michod I could not finish. I tried to watch another film by Michod, the Rover, a year ago and couldn't finish it either. Both that film and this one are technically well executed, the dialogue is grounded, there are no obvious and irritating plot holes and yet I at least can never connect with any of his protagonists. This is strange because Guy Pearce in the Rover is quite sympathetic, so it's not whats on the paper but the execution of it that fails.It takes guts to rewrite a period in history that has already been covered by Shakespeare, and it can be done successfully but I don't think it's been done well here. If this is a success for Netflix I hope it leads to more high end historical productions but I felt the need to check the hype on this one.6/10"
638,"The scène fighting with knights with full armour is fake, only rich people had full armour and the doesn't fight, they sitting safely on the horses miles away from the battlefield to look if the must flee to home or Celebrate and honor on ironing if there warriors are winning"
639,"I do not know much of the period. Whether this film takes more from Shakespeare than historic fact. But I know that it is a thrilling watch.The casting is superb, Charlamet portrays a young, but wise and fearful king. A role that makes you want to second guess him as a leader and then want to follow him into battle. Something that is truly hard to convey. The supporting cast is just as impressive...every character is believable.There are some beautiful shots in The King. Stand out battle scenes that are breath taking and desperate. Certain moments where you gasp at what is happening in front of you. Much like the Battle of the Bastards or Helms Deep.This action/drama is a must see for anyone that has a passive or assertive interest in history. Whether or not it takes artistic licence or not, take it up with Shakespeare."
640,"What genius thought it would be a good idea to rewrite Shakespeare?! Cobbled together from the plots of Shakespeare's Henry IVs (Parts 1 and 2) and Henry V, but (obviously) not as well written cause, duh, who can improve on Shakespeare? Seriously baffled by this decision. I mean if you're gonna use Shakespeare's plot then why not use his words as well? I mean the guy's only a genius.
I liked the performances fine but would've loved to've seen them tackle Shakespeare's Henry V, would've been way more memorable than this forgettable 'Shakespeare for Dummies'."
641,The story half stopped. Poor cheap battle scene. Blood is poor.
642,"Highly enjoyed this film, whilst also developing a slight crush for the lead (lol) the young actor is absolutely fantastic and this film had me feeling patriotic at pinnacle moments, I would definitely recommend this film - on my list of the best Netflix films/series' of the year.Great film all round, bit of a hidden gem!"
643,"If you're a history buff with an interest in seeing real life events dramatised on the screen then this film is for you. If you're looking for something with lots of action and excitement then you should look elsewhere. This movie tells the story of King Henry V of England's rise to the throne and his war with the French and decisive and important victory at Agincourt. The thing, of course, is that while the story is broadly based on actual events, it does not stick to the facts. Instead, it embellishes, changes and sometimes omits what actually happened in the interests of making a good movie. If you're wanting a history lesson this isn't it. There is no question that this movie is brilliantly acted and executed, but it is pretty slow going for the most part and takes a while to actually get interesting. I resisted the impulse to abandon it early on and by the time the battle scene came around I was glad I persevered. In the end though, I was left feeling pretty unmoved by it all and doubt I'd be bothered watching it again."
644,Didn't know what to expect but I loved Timothée from Call me By Your Name so was intrigued - but wow he was great! Robert Pattinson as the crazed Dauphin was impressive tooJoel Edgerton was brilliant as Falstaff and I was genuinely moved by his arcAt 2hr20 I thought I'd get bored but the movie was so well written and enjoyable that it flew in and I wished for more
645,"A wonderful performance by Timothee (as usual he carries the whole film), but its just hard for me to believe that he was such a righteous man ... given his age and well known debauchery ... it was hard for me to understand how his character did a 180. Also, the frailty of his body made me wonder how he could even fight with all that chainmail and armor ...?!?"
646,"Great performances from Chalamet, Egerton and even Depp as well just about everyone else. This is a thoughtful film that owes more to Shakespeare than historical source material.
My only gripe, Robert Pattinson. A dreadful actor delivering 'Allo Allo' style lines, surely they could've a French guy who could act?"
647,"""The King"" is a bold and daring story of one of the most interesting monarchs England ever had. This narrative, however, inaccurate it might prove to be, still makes for a great premise, and without a doubt, it delivers enough to keep you gripped throughout its run time.
The film witnesses a remarkable performance of a true rising star, Chalamet spares us none of his talents as he explores his subject deeply and vividly and delivers a solid effort that only bolstered his acting status, the rest of the cast was great as it gives much-needed authenticity to the story.
In the end, this film serves its purpose of telling a story, and it does it wonderfully, A solid film."
648,"HAHAHAHAHA, empty Hollywood movie betting all its interest on the new favourite actor of the cinema. The only depth of this film is in the music and the expression of a chalamet that will remain closed all along. One only has to do a little research to see that all the historical elements are excessively modified. Moreover the representation of the French as cruel and arrogant is quite pathetic. This film doesn't even have the pleasure to teach us anything about history. It's a popularization of Hollywood history, full of money and empty of meaning."
649,"2 hours and 20 minutes of bullish, that's all what it is."
650,One of the worst movie I've ever seen. Don't waste your time.
651,Should have been a mini series though. I feel like there was a lot more you could have fit in with the story line.
652,"Watched it for Chalamet, stayed for Edgerton and Pattinson particularly the latter...I have been excited to see this ever since it was announced that Timothée Chalamet was going to be playing King Henry V, who as always is a triumph up on screen - he's the male Jennifer Lawrence, who keeps picking the meaty roles and will eventually land his Oscar (and rightly so) however it wont be for this role!Chalamet plays a character that soo many others have played over the year, yet he brings a subtlety and captivating performance - that at times i don't see anyone else on the screen.I am the furthest from a Robert Pattinson fan but somehow he had me eating out the palm of his hand as The Dauphin - campy, over the top and at times creepy.
Yet his death scene was very lacklustre and i felt all this built up through the film was for nothing!Sean Harris as always excels playing Chief Justice William Gascoigne - theres a scene near the end that had me soo gripped just by how he completely embraced this character and went toe to toe with Chalamet.Joel Edgerton as Falstaff brings a much needed breath of fresh air into The King and for me is one of the biggest stand outs from the beginning.The battle scenes are directed brilliantly and gets you right in to the action - which at times is quite brutal but the cinematography adds a new dynamic that feels more rich and exuberant.The end battle in particular did give me Game of Thrones vibes which i also quite liked.Overall there are alot of peaks in The King which kept me gripped, however there are other movies in this genre i have watched over the years that i feel are better developed."
653,"Having so much mass produced mediocre material around these days, it is so brilliantly refreshing when you finally do find that gem. The King - I was glued to every second of this film. It does not rely on mindless gore, but utilises a solid plot, amazing cinematography, a script so good you will want to repeat phrases yourself when someone is being obnoxious around you, and acting that puts you in the movie, never to be snapped out due to poorly acted line.Edgerton in plate mail stomping around.. I was passionate about his character, just so so enjoyable to experience. And just wait until you meet the Dauphin...Absolutely recommended to anyone who wants to experience a movie, rather than just watch one.10/10."
654,"Honestly, I have no idea whether it's accurate or not, but I know it's amazing. The acting is fantastic, and the cinematography is superb. I cannot give this film enough praise. Some say it's a bit slow, and I'll admit that's true, but if you like period pieces with great acting this is definitely for you. I normally try to analyze films, but I just...can't on this one. So watch it or don't, but it's great."
655,"Great writing, and it takes you back in time and you feel part of. But what is the most great about the movie is the historical accuracy. Every little detail was thrown in: how people behaved, what they wore, what they talked about, what they ate, if they ate, the hairstyle. Many many thanks to who developed this project. Another similar movie is definitely Outlaw King, always on Netflix, check that out too."
656,"The writer of the movie John Edgerton wrote a scene for himself that had no bearing on the plot of the movie. The troubling scene is during the first night Falstaff arrives to the new king's castle. The scene shows Edgerton enjoying a bath and moaning in pleasure as his foot is massaged by an unseen servant. The young king comes in to speak to Falstaff. When he does the servant nervously jumps away from the bath now standing at attention. It's a young boy. The prince and Edgerton exchange creepy glances as the scene quickly ends.The next scene we are told Falstaff is a ""good man.""In a later scene, boys are brutalized to show how evil a villain is.Throughout the movie young boys are always treated by the writer and director as props or drones not as human beings."
657,"Half an hour in and the inaccuracy is astonishing. Enjoy this if you !Ike but forget about it being history. ""inspired by historical events"" is about as close as you can get. And yet the facts are dramatic, dynamic, suspenseful - all the makings of a great plot. If only the makers of this had used them"
658,"A stereotypical prince whose interest is about war.. It is easy to predict he will be dead even if you don't know the history.I am not much a reviewer on the view of ""hystorical accuracy"". If the movie's itself have a really good concept of its own history and convince the viewers on this frame then i don't obsess to historical accuracy but this movie could not convince the viewers on this frame.Even all soldiers wear a kind of plate armor, which is not real. There is a difference between a soldier and a knight.I don't know that but when i read somethin it says that Dauphin, the French hair did not kill children in the forest.One of the most important scene is battle of Agincourt and it is really disappointing. The tactics in the battle are really terrible. You can win this war with this tactics if your enemy is dumb. There was no crossbow archers in French army. There can not be so many plate shiny armors in a battle. One of the main mistakes is not usage of tabards in the battle. You are shooting a battle scene but most of the soldiers did not wear any tabard therefore it is almost impossible to know who is friend who is enemy.Apart from historical accuracy, there is no good cinematography. Could not find any dark and epic atmosphere so the movie could not convince the viewer.
They are shooting a movie, with no gesture no mimics of the 15th century. It is almost like they put together cast and said lets shoot a battle scene. No good performances, no good character development...Most importantly, it must be a joke that the ratings of Alexander, King Arthur or Kingdom of Heaven is lower than this garbage."
659,We can only hope for more of this quality from Netflix
660,"If you have enough patience to sit through it. There were lot of moments you just felt you'd give up, because there were so many moments that not just slow, staggering or even stagnant. But at least this movie was without disgusting CGI effect, explosions, crazy soundtrack, stupid over-the-top makeup. The tempo was extremely slow, but the dialog was still quite intelligent enough. Acting of all the actors was pretty good, they were just enslaved by a very slow script with very uninspiring conversation among the characters. The head chopping scene in early British style punishment looked quite shockingly real. If it's in 3-D, the head might rolling out of the screen and ended up on your lap.All in all, it's watchable, not great, not even would move you emotionally. Forget about what some of the reviewers' accusations about not matching the exact historical facts. Give it a rest, will you? This a dramatized movie adapted and roughly used some history as the background. You don't have to check your history textbook moment by moment, scene by scene, to see if it's correct. If you're so split-hair stubborn, try to find some BBC documentary stuff to satisfy you. Why can't you just put everything you knew or learned in the class aside, and watch it without any self-bondage or binding. It's just a movie, for Christ's sake!"
661,"Henry V was an interesting enough person in real history that creating an embellished and incredibly inaccurate piece of film is not only unnecessary, but insulting. They couldn't even bother to get basic history even marginally correct - oh, yes, Henry V was son of Henry IV, but that's as close to accurate as this gets.
The ONLY reason it got any stars from me is because the fight scene with Percy was very well done, though, again, not at all true to the history.
I don't blame the actors - they were actually quite good. I do blame the WRITERS and PRODUCERS for creating a completely false narrative for one of the greatest military minds of the early 15th century.
Please, if you're going to create a historically-based work, try to get the history at least somewhat correct. Embellishment is one thing, but rewriting the facts is dishonerable, at best. Even just getting the dates of death right - or close - would be a huge improvement for this work, much less the circumstances of the deaths.
Shame on Plan B for putting this out like this."
662,"I was looking forward to watching this for a while and when I did I was very disappointed.The acting is very good but the film itself is dull. There is no suspense, no action, no charisma, nothing to hold the attention.There are worse films out there but this one I almost switched off halfway through and I've only done that about 3 times ever."
663,"This film starts out well by depicting Hal and Thomas, the sons of Henry IV Lancaster, and how Hal assumes the throne. The first third is fine. However. The supposed machinations to get Henry V to go to war in France are so wildly off the mark as to ruin the movie. Much of the Battle of Agincourt itself was depicted accurately. But the Dauphin was not present, and he did not challenge Henry to single combat. The King did not personally surrender to Henry either. There was no assassination attempt on Henry historically, and both the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Chief Justice were loyal and favorites of Henrym unlike in the movie. Oh, and in the royal Court bishops do not wear mitres- that's only in church services."
664,Nothing about king Henry V in this movie is historically accurate. Horrible. I hope people don't think they are learning history from this. The real Henry V believed that it was gods will that he fight to unite France and England under his crown. Thisovie makes him out to be anti-war with France and his father to be a horrible tyrant which is also very inaccurate. Stay away!!
665,"This movie thoroughly traduces history, but so it goes. Historical fiction is first and foremost fiction, with history as selective window-dressing. This film fails because the clunky, tone-deaf screenplay makes so little sense - with or without a little prior knowledge of the history - that no amount of mud-streaked plate-armour or moody candle-light could make it less grating.The film ignores the fact that England and France had been at war since the mid-14th century, and that Henry V came to the throne as an experienced, enthusiastic and cunning warrior-king with a keen sense of entitlement to French real estate. Yet what really grates with this script is the grossly simplified picture of Henry we're given. The writers plainly boiled everything down to a simple idea: a pouting teenage wastrel has responsibility thrust upon him, eventually steps up to the mark when his innate nobility is stoked and is so guileless that he is dragged into war by scheming grown-ups.I fear that the expensive pretence of historical accuracy blinded viewers and producers alike to the fact that the story is so crass and simplistic, and the characters so one-dimensional, that it wouldn't make the cut for an average soap opera.On a positive note, I can now see why Timothée Chalamet was cast as Paul Atreides in Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of Dune. He can bring grit and majesty."
666,"This is a decent film but after hearing the praise I couldn't help but be a little disappointed. The acting was decent but just the overall tone I struggled with. It's a sad film of a new king trying to do right but probably just doing the same thing that's been being done before. There's a lot of death and strife. That said I just wasn't drawn to any of the characters. I didn't really care for anybody on the English or French side. The action was pretty good and chaotic and I think they did a real good job with that part but when you have no emotional investment really it doesn't land. I did like the end where the King figured out the one who had been misleading him, although I assumed that from the get go. Worth watching but it certainly didn't blow my mind."
667,"The starting is ver good, but the ending is weak, this young actor Timothée is so brilliant, he has a long career ahead, I am sad becuse I thought this film could be great but just normal, not big deal, if you want to watch it, that iis up to you"
668,"As the movie opens, young Prince Hal (Timothée Chalamet) - the first son of King Henry IV of England - has left behind royal life and adopted his infamous ""wayward"" life. But soon thereafter his father's illness and eventual death brings him back to the court and ultimately puts him on the throne as King Henry V, immediately plunged into the complicated politics of the 15th century English court, with a desire to set right some of his father's wrongs, to establish the legitimacy of his reign and to achieve some of what his father had been unable to achieve - primarily to successfully claim the throne of France.Basically, the movie is well done technically. The sets and costumes give an authetic 15th century atmosphere, and the climactic Battle of Agincourt, in which the English (led by young Henry, by now King) defeated a much larger French army, is extremely well choreographed and it does accurately depict the use of the English longbow, which was in fact a much superior weapon to the cross bow used by the French, the use of which played a key role in the real Battle of Agincourt.) Having said that, the movie is also riddled with historical inaccuracies that are too numerous to recount here. Rather than being based on the historical record, ""The King"" is largely based on the relevant plays of William Shakespeare, which produces one of the greatest (because it was so central to the story) of the historical inaccuracies - the front and centre presence of Sir John Falstaff - who never existed, but was a fictional chartacter created by The Bard. So, if you're looking for a history lesson, you won't find it here except perhaps in very broad brushstrokes. Nor will you find a recounting of Shakespeare. This is more of a mish mash of some of Shakespeare's work, combined with a bit of history and a lot of historical licence.It's a tough slog at times to get through. I found it far too long at almost two and a half hours and there were times when it felt as though I could have skipped lengthy parts of this and not really missed very much of consequence. However the performances were good, and while I think it's a bit over-rated, I certainly wouldn't call this a bad movie, especially for those with an interest in the medieval era. (5/10)"
669,Loved this movie from start to finish. Incredible direction and production. Superb storyline / script.
670,"I was looking forward to this film it's ok but, and that's typical of a lot of films released now.
The battle scenes are ok and there are some good touches in them and taking nothing from the actors but its lacking something.
I cant help but thing Kenneth branagh's Henry v is far superior."
671,"'The King', just impressed me by his style of narrative, I think that in the absence of a better montage this film could positively conquer criticism.
This movie offered me one of the best battles I've seen in the cinema, offering without a doubt the necessary realism."
672,"I really enjoyed this movie and respect its commit to accuracy of fights, shields, armors, war techniques and even conversationsThey didn't try to be cool by the fights or cliche conversationsThat's why they r unique history film"
673,"What is facsinating is to consider that French have lost the battle of globalization, and this movie is part of the war, a battle to rewrite history."
674,"But couple details - like King Henrys wound in Face - distracts me. Read Bernand Cornwell book 'azincourt'. Seems To me it iso More historically accurate than this. Great film thouhg, especially Joel Edgerton as Sir John."
675,"I just want to outburst my honest review about this film, The King. I wanted to share this because of how good the movie was from every inch of it as I'm suffocated to its story and script. This was the first movie I watched Timothée Chalamet having a role that is mature but still have the heart to it as Hal, King Henry V of England. It was pretty epic, I am so engaged on how it is put together and end up becoming a masterpiece. And now, I believe that 'A King has no friends.' It is challenging to accept the fact that most of the good people comes from those who are forced or love to do stupid things to fullfill their needs and leisure. But this film, earned my respect on how to treasure the person you truly know from the beginning as they tell you the truth of yourself like being honest that it could hurt you in a good way leaving you knowing who you can trust. Robert Pattinson was so outrageously fun on this, like in his line as I remember 'Speak English, I enjoy speaking English' as he fought the King of England with his childish words knowing that he deserve to be a King's alliance to his father in France who he, indeed laughing in return of not knowing what the future is up for his blonde son. It was hands down, one of the movies I find long for a war era type of film but the substance is pure. Like it lingers on your thoughts knowing every person around you might question those you can trust in peace and by words. I will never forget how Hal offer The Dauphin of France a request for a battle but refuses him by shedding blood on an open field making me sad for what awaits on Sir John's fate. I felt the words of Hal returning to his men with anger and despair as he kneel to the dead body of his friend showing desperation of making decisions which made him a King of truth by the end. Such a film with great performances, I just loved it. *****"
676,Great movie. Great piece of history told in a beautiful way. I can go on and on about how good this movie is but you should watch it for yourself and be the judge. Definitely worth the 2 hours plus run time. Last but not least Robert Pattinson is also great as the zealous douphin cant wait to see him in the new batman movie.
677,"The reviews I read so far fall into two categories. Firstly, it's not historically accurate. Secondly, it's a superb story.Firstly, Shakespeare often took liberty with the truth (eg. Macbeth). This story does nothing Shakespeare would not have been willing to do himself. However, the language is not accurate (it's nothing like Chaucer). So, I am comfortable with its accuracy and deviation from the truth, especially as the deviations were not for political reasons.Secondly, the story telling is very enjoyable. The movie deals with logistics in battles, politics, power struggles, and alliances. The meeting between the two kings was very well played out.I saw some comments about the ""woke"" nature of this film. I strongly dislike Netflix who have a string of fundamental issues with their dealings of the sexes in their productions. This is the first show i've seen from Netflix that does a solid job in dealing with the sexes. Keep in mind that most characters were passive (and that includes a few of the female characters). The characters that counted (of both sexes) were thoughtful and thought-provoking - which is almost unheard of from Netflix (or modern Hollywood for that matter).If there are weak characters, it would be Pattinson (who was almost certainly told to play a French Imbecile) and Harris (who was mostly steady but inconsistent, especially as the story progressed).For those that complain about the portrayal of Depp as Catherine, she is exactly what I would expect from a woman brought up in a noble family surrounded by wealth and the best tutors money could buy. I would suggest that many modern actresses could learn MUCH from Depp (eg. Blanchett, Gadot, Brie Larson etc who are frustrating actresses with minimal subtlety, minimal strength of character, and inconsistent acting talent). Depp was amazing in that she behaved much like a normal but very capable human being who earned respect rather than telling you she deserved it.I am married to a professional, very capable, and strong woman. Any decent man would want a woman like Catherine. For that, I am grateful that film makers cater to people like me who are not politically correct. I lost a lot of respect for actresses like Blanchett and female leaders like Kathleen Kennedy who were once amazing women (see Kennedy's ""the force is female"" t-shirt as an example of how immature this once amazing woman has become).The King is a slow paced movie. I enjoyed much of the dialog. I enjoyed most of the acting. I would suggest the portrayals are somewhat sanitised - although they were not sanitised for sexist/racist purposes as oft happens today.If you like a thoughtful story, this is definitely worth watching. If you have been burned by Netflix's intolerance that it frequently exhibits (eg. the later seasons of Black Mirror), rest assured, this film is not your typical Netflix ""woke"" propaganda. I certify it ""woke free"".There is some violence. I do not recommend this for under 16 or those that are squeamish as a few scenes are up close and personal."
678,"I really had no idea the film was already finished. My jaw dropped as I watched it end just craving more of it. Please let there be a part 2!!!!!! If so I will be waiting on it as if it were my vacation. lol. I mean seriously I myself was fooled by some of the characters. I was irritated at the lies yet impressed as the King knew not to fully trust even his own men. Yet he handled it so well. This film was definitely intense, intriguing, and I was much entertained I even forgot I was studying. So worth it."
679,I am convinced that those who gave a low rating did not watch the entire movie. What a great portrayal of Shakespeare's work. The leading actors did a brilliant job and that speech timothee chalamet gave before the battle deserves an Oscar. Also phenomenal directing and cinematography. Great job Netflix.
680,"This film start with a man ""Hotspur"" stabbing a man at the battlefield, the introduction of a England Prince ""Hal"" and his friend ""Falstaff"", and Hal's brother ""Thomas"" get kill and Hal's father ""Henry IV"" die by his illness scene! As turnout, this film is about Hal start a war with France to unite his own kingdom! Entire film quite slow and bored! The action in the film also low satisfaction and messy! Such as, first one, Hal fight with Hotspur and eventually kill him at the battlefield scene! This scene have some punching and Hal easily stab his opponent to death! Low satisfaction and not intense! Second one, the ending battle with France scene! This scene have some arrow shooting, punching and stabbing scene, but quite slow and messy! Very disappointed! Barely intense scene is, Hal chop off one of his own man's head scene! This scene show in detail! At the end, Hal and Falstaff fight with France's army! Falstaff kill by France's army! The prince of France ""Dauphin"" arrive, he step down from the horse and slipping at the mud! Hal order his army to kill him! At the very end, Hal found out the war with France actually is a lie setup by William, he kill William by stabbing William's head! That's it! Another disappointed film!"
681,A good film. But origin of the F-word was around 1475. He reigned 1413 to 1422. So needless use of the F-word.
682,Great set pieces. Wonderful actors. Haunting and beautiful. It's just a shame there has to be constant mood music throughout. The sound needed to breath a bit. Oh well - I guess Chris Nolan has a lot to answer for - but I think only he and Hans can do it effectively...
683,"Created my account to Rate 0 to The King title, It wasted my 2h 20min of life.
I need my time back!!!"
684,I haven't seen this movie. But I already know it's the best movie ever. See u
685,"Extremely well made with disturbing parallels to the ongoing coup attempts in our present D.C. kingdom where every man ""has his own worlds behind his eyes"" (as the kings sister warns him) and the truth is not forthcoming from even the best of them. The photography, acting, and direction are top notch. The screenwriting is well-researched and translated to our understanding. The action is quite sufficient for this caliber of film, which reminds one of the HBO approach to John Adams. But the striking aspect, as another reviewer pointed out, is the political war that was engaged before the young king came into power and the persistence of just behind the throne treachery pervading the entire story. Trump is not a teen, but young in the world of cutthroat politics. France suggests that the king is not in his right mind. And so on..."
686,"Was looking forward to this movie but I was disappointed right from the start ,changing historical events is shame full. The films version of the Battle of Shrewsbury Complete joke 5000 soldiers died on that day and Henry Percy died in battle. Also future king Henry V fought along side his father King Henry IV it's a insult to our history.
Watch the Hallow Crown much better"
687,"It's the worst movie I have seen lately. It's too slow, the text of the dialogues are very poor. Even the sets and the cinematography aren't worthy.
I really don't get how people can give more than 3 stars to this movie!"
688,It had so much promise and I kept thinking it'll really get going soon but by the time Robert Pattinson showed up with a French accent I gave up.
689,"Did the writers of this garbage go to the Mel Gibson school of history? Artistic licence can be acceptable sometimes, but this was too much. After the first few minutes, watching the far-too-young Hotspur speaking (like his father) with a decidedly unNorthumbrian accent at the dinner table, I knew this was going to be a travesty.The costumes and period settings were fine, and the acting too, however, after 42 minutes, I gave up. Not wanting to be pedantic, I missed the Battle of Shrewsbury, because according to this nonsense it DID NOT TAKE PLACE. Anyone with the slightest historical knowledge knew that this was one of the most important battles in English history. The first between 2 English armies using longbows against each other. And where was the King? Henry IV had an army of 28,000 against Hotspur's 14,00 (Owen Glendower never turned up in time to help out). Prince Henry was carried from the field with an arrow through his head, and Hotspur took a fatal one in the eye.There was no need for Falstaff (played by one of the writers) because he didn't exist. I wasn't going to stay with this for the Battle of Agincourt: apart from having a fair idea how it actually went, I have been on that battlefield and wasn't going to watch more fiction.Finally, the idea of Prince Hal beating Hotspur in a one-on-one fight is ridiculous. I'm being generous, giving this 6."
690,"The acting itself is amazing, the producers and director had everything perfectly concocted. The music, the sets and the fashion were amalgamated to tell the story.
I genuinely loved the lines and use of ancient English, especially in King Henry's lines with his voice too.Anyway, I think Henry should have fought the Prince Dauphin to show his greatness. And I've seen the aerial view of Sir John Falstaff on the battlefield, was the same as Jon Snow's in the battle of bastards. The commenders' chairs also were identical to those of Lannisters in GAME OF THRONES."
691,"This Netflix adaption, based on Shakespeare's ""Henry V"", follows a reluctant Prince's ascension to becoming King Henry V of England, where he strives to unify the country and resolve domestic difference's, and ultimately lead his united country to victory in France, claiming the French crown.The musical score, and Timothée Chalamet's ""Hal / King Henry"", are both dark, brooding, slow and intense. The movie echoes the same feeling, building slowly until the Battle of Agincourt in 1415.The cast are superb throughout, (Robert Pattinson as the Dauphin is hilarious!), and the dialogue is excellent, not a word is wasted. The movie does have a slow pace to it focusing often on Henry's isolation at the top, and at times gets a little bit lost whilst trying to maintain thoughtful tension, which comes across as a little flat.However, the camera work, and production quality do make up for any shortcomings, and what you are looking at is a work of art."
692,Interesting drama with a dramatic visual lookSlow start but builds up nicely with as always Timothee Chalamet immensely watchable
693,I feel Henry V was portrayed as a drunk wayward prince who became an almost saintly king overnight . I enjoyed the film and found it very interesting . However I came away from it thinking Henry V's character was a bit unbelieveable .
694,"(lite spoilers) The King has everything required in a great film. Compelling characters excellently portrayed. Great script. Gritty realism in sets and costume. Subtlety in plot and dialogue. I really loved the period language. But ... for some reason it just never really got there for me. I can't speak to historical accuracy for I don't know the history. There are elements and segments that really stand out, but overall it has a brooding quality that felt overdone. It never seems to get out of the gray. There's a portentous weight on everything that never wants to let you breathe. They didn't really need the constant score. There are many scenes that would have played better on their own without the incessant tonal atmospherics. I think performances were strong enough without having to force the scene with bg music. The battle was a powerful series of scenes but I think GoT stole some of that thunder with Battle Of The Bastards."
695,A by the books medieval epic that does little to reinvent the formula.
696,"The King tells a very interesting story about the rise of King Henry V. The action is good, but there is not enough of it. The story gets a little choppy in parts and feels a little rushed in the middle. The acting however is great. It really feels like you are back in time watching the events unfold. Overall this is a very solid movie and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a movie to watch on a Friday night."
697,"Ok, as far as Netflix fare goes this is probably among the best it has to offer, although that's not saying too much. The King was ok - it looked good, and the acting was reasonable. However I found the music to be incredibly intrusive as it barely stopped droning for the entire movie. Why? Why do that? We don't need to be told what mood to feel all the time. Most of us are quite capable of working that out for ourselves!I found the whole thing a little overblown, and even forced. When compared to something like Wolf Hall for instance this is rather pale fare.So 6 points out of 10 for Joel Edgerton for his accent, which was great, and for the overall look of the film, but that's all. Sorry The King."
698,"The King Made by David Michôd is a beautiful movie with wonderful cinematography and soundtrack. Timothée Chalamet is very good in the movie, making a character very different from anyone he has done before. I liked the message that the movie passed me from every king even with good intentions always corrupting for war and evil. My problems with the movie are his attempts at humor, using Joel Edgerton's character as comic relief, Robert Pattinson's character resolution is terrible, a real disappointment for me, and some explanation / apology that the film gives for considerably important situations. in the movie, which I won't talk about here for spoilers. I really liked the character of Lily-Rose Depp, his interaction with Timothée is very good, questioning him and I think that although a little expository does not compromise the movie. I liked it but expected more. 7/10"
699,"Created my account to Rate 0 to The King title, It wasted my  2h 20min of life."
700,I had really high expectations as I like historical fiction. Yes - fiction. I don't mind historical inaccuracies as long as it's entertaining. This movie wasn't. It was just boring.
701,"As a sometime musician, I find it interesting that while a modern musician would be loath to change a single note from any of Bach's or Mozart's compositions, today's screenwriters have no problem rewriting Shakespeare so as to not only change the play, but to make it the opposite of what Shakespeare intended.Watching this I had mixed feelings. It is a well made production, the cast are generally good, the battle scenes are well done. The problem for me was the premise; if you want to rewrite Shakespeare you better be an extraordinary writer, or it will not work. One of the most important things for any movie is the ability for the audience to suspend disbelief and to maintain that suspension for the whole movie. It becomes a serious problem when the audience starts asking questions like ""Wait, he's an anti-war millennial but out of the blue says kill all prisoners"". Where did that come from? Or he's a King who just conquered France, but then gets lectured to by the French princess and he just stands there looking like a lost puppy. It just doesn't make sense.It occurred to me that this movie isn't supposed to make sense, it's only supposed to tick the boxes for the woke millennial college student who fantasises what it would be like to be a King in the middle ages. It would be a great opportunity to show medieval neanderthals concepts like being against war and listening to princesses. The woke millennial fantasises that he can kill real warriors in single combat but he'd rather be sitting in a dark corner being moody. He looks moodily at the deplorables around him and wishes the middle ages would end already.I don't know too much about the real King Henry V, but for me to suspend disbelief I would have to go along with the idea that a modern woke millennial can mood his way through being a King in the middle ages, to be a pacifist and sensitive guy who reluctantly kills because he's forced to. Such a King would have been regarded as a pathetic weakling and Henry's own father usurped just such a King. As I said, I don't know too much about King Henry, but I know he wasn't this guy. So my suspension of disbelief failed, which is disastrous for any movie. I think this kind of rewriting of history to suit modern sensitivities could work, but it requires writing and directing with much more skill and subtlety than shown here."
702,This film borrows a lot from Shakespeare's imagination and adds more mythology besides. But it's worth just to see Robert Pattinson's hilarious turn as the sassy French prince.
703,Why was it filmed so dark. You couldn't see their faces so couldn't get to know the characters. Really poorly thought out.
704,"The story of Henry V, from inheriting the crown from his father to his famous victory at Agincourt.An often stirring, thoughtful and very serious telling of the tale which focusses predominantly on the strategies and smarts needed by the young king to get him through war with France and to understand the political necessities to be supreme ruler.The cast are excellent with particularly Harris as Henry's principal advisor and Edgerton as an enjoyable, albeit less comic than usual, Falstaff edging ahead. Chalamet is the tricky one and whilst he is a terrific actor and performs a great turn as Henry, occasionally it seems an uncomfortable fit.There is little to take issue with however. Edgerton's script is fine if a little flowery in places and fun though Pattinson is as the Dauphin, he seems as if he's auditioning for a Bond villain role.The film twists and turns quite nicely and is often quite violent, but overall it's a great tale, beautiful to look at and well told."
705,"Let me just say, I think this is a good movie, the production, the directing, writing and acting are all brilliant, but the movie is also very slow, and drags a lot during the first and second acts, for the most part. With a runtime of nearly two and a half hours, something that begins to bore you that soon into the movie, that is a problem. The only thing that kept from from turning it off, was the amazing performance of Timothée Chalamet - despite his consistent whispering throughout the film.The third act is where the movie really takes off, and we get a very intelligent, and well shot action scene. It was very similar to the Battle of the Bastards from Game of Thrones, and it served the movie well. The music in this film is also very good. One of the best things about this movie, was none other than Robert Pattinson. Who would think the emotionless vampire from Twilight would come so far. He shines here (pun not intended), despite his very minimal screen time. His French accent was also very good, I did notice a few off words here and there, but other than that, he was an intimidating villian to the movie. I just wish we got more of him.However, my biggest complaint, and anyone who has seen the trailer or the news, is that the movie kind-of tried to set itself up to be a romance. Well, that's what I got from it. There is literary no romance in this film at all, and Henry's love interest doesn't appear until very late into the film.Despite it dragging in tons of places, the King is still a good movie, abit very slow. If you don't mind those kind of films, then you will find a great deal of enjoyment from the King, if you are expecting an action-packed war film, or a love-stricken romance, this isn't your movie.6/10"
706,"I really enjoyed this film and I've been very happy with how Netflix has made another very accurate historical film. I won't repeat what everyone else has praised it for, and my only complaint is that sometimes I felt some of the characters were a bit bland. Like they wouldn't react to something like a real human would. MINOR SPOILER at one point a characters son dies in front of him yet he doesn't so much as flinch. Other than that I loved it."
707,It's very long and dark and sometimes quite tedious. Robert Pattinson is such a breath of fresh air. Okay movie; wouldn't watch it again.
708,"I liked this film, Timothée Chalamet, Sean Harris and Joel Edgerton played exceedingly well but I would have liked if the director would have omitted the Greta Thunberg wannabe as Quenn Catherine and the scene between Henry and Catherine at the end."
709,"I was looking forward to this movie because it promised to basically be an expansion of the story most people know from Shakespeare's Henry V. Unfortunately it is a one note waste of the viewers time.Historically inaccurate in a number of different ways. I get annoyed with Falstaff being the one genius who puts the strategy of Agincourt together (not only is that crazy, but Falstaff only existed in Shakespeare's plays, not in the real world), that the king fights on the field in complete absence of the Royal Guard, and that the various embellishments like single combat to settle wars.The real problem is that it is a one note work. The same dull droning music plays throughout, mumble whispering is the order of the day for every scene, and there is no emotions portrayed except, well, sort of a cross being ennui, fatalism and this is the first reading of the work. Every has this same emotional note for everything, whether they are riding into battle, eating dinner, ordering people to be executed or...well everything.What a dull waste of time."
710,"I am a man who is quite knowledgeable in history, whose authenticity and accuracy are important. Obviously, a perfectly authentic film is almost impossible to make, I wouldn't expect it, and of course, movie is movie. But nowadays, there are plenty of options at your fingertips. Since this movie is a historical one, you need to test its authenticity!
First of all, I would start by saying that this movie is not bad, but unfortunately it is not good either. I'm a little disappointed... Just a little bit, because I saw in the trailer what the movie would be like... In my opinion Netflix wants to compete with the HBO Game of Thrones (which is a big mistake in such a historical movie) and the crew (and many others, unfortunately) are very misinformed about what the late medieval Europe was look like. There are many stereotypes...
I understand that the budget was fundamentally low, and that movie is partly based on Shakespeare Henry V's (which in itself makes the film in many ways inaccurate in itself, mainly in terms of events), but the former reasons do not explain the more historical inaccuracy. I've read reviews (both here and elsewhere) that sets and costumes are realistic... No, not realistic! The whole environment is too dark, the costumes are not authentic, understated and too colorless and for example I don't see any skinny dresses on man (which was very popular back then). Medieval people loved colors! From the points discussed above, Henry V (1944) is much better. And then there is the ""battle"" (of Agincourt) (which is not entirely bad, there are right moments), which is like the BotB in GoT (sad). The Battle of Agincourt in this movie is too chaotic, unrealistic, with mistakes, for examples: mounted men-at-arms have no lances, there is no French dismounted men-at-arms and infantry (crossbowmen), English and Welsh archers are ""shooting"" at the wrong angle with their longbows, no sticks, etc. And finally there is the siege, which is worse than the battle (very minimalist)... Some (major) mistakes of many: the besieged place (Harfleur) is not a castle, but a port city, instead of trebuchets should have been used guns, no mining, etc. Sad because I was expecting something from this movie, but it seems to be so telling. Thanks to everyone who read my review!"

712,"This movie is well done, gripping and holds your interest until almost the end. However, so much of it distorts the truth, in fact NEVER happened that I can't give it more than 6 stars. Why do movie producers have to lie about what really happened? Tell us the truth. Making up a more ""woke"" version is sugar coating. Henry V wasn't sorry for winning Agincourt, it was a victory for Englanda. I liked this movie up until the last 10 minutes, then it got silly."
713,"What a tragic waste of film. Poorly written, the acting was sub-par, the historical context was skipped over... why didn't I give this up ten minutes in? I suppose I wanted to see if it got worse, it did. Much worse, worse than I could have ever imagined"
714,Must have had a low budget and very poor movie era research. The knight armor and schloss settings were totally inaccurate. I simply couldn't stand to continue watching this trash. Ruined the who thing for me.
715,I only watched this because Timothée Chalamet but I was really disappointed and turned it of within an hour of the film. I would mabye watch it as everyone is different but I just don't like these kind of films.
716,"I think I have outgrown this sort of film. I was aware of the overwhelmingly good critiques to this picture, however, it's not what I had expected. Nor what I wanted. I think the latter is the most accurate of my taste.I am not wanting to watch this kind of film anymore.The great direction, set pieces, costumes and detail are what makes the movie. It is not flawed as a period piece - in fact I go far to say it is better to represent the people as various ages, especially the young King Henry V. I believe it is a more accurate portrayal of what people were like during this period - however some have commented on the inaccuracies. So I am not a historian. I just liked those parts the most.However pretty it is, it is pretty dull for me. It takes its sweet time to move along, and I am up for that generally in films, but I am not up for this kind of pace to accomplish a moody movie.That's it I think - I am not into moody movie's at the moment. Been done so many times. I think that will be it for me in this genre..."
717,It might be nice to watch but historically inaccurate. The king acts so modern day (unlike the real HenryV) what's the aim in glorifying invasion of other people's land .that was medieval and wrong. why do they take the trouble to show the french dauphin as a blood thirsty moron ? you were invading their land for god's sake. It made the movie looks like a British propaganda!!
718,"Why do film makers insist on mangling history? This film, whilst reasonable to watch if a good 30 minutes too long, has about as about as much to do with the historical facts as does a Harry Potter book! There are so many inaccuracies it would take too long to list them all but just a few are:-There was no such man as Falstaff - Harry Hotspur and Henry did not fight each other, by the way whatever happened to the actual Battle of Shrewsbury? - Henry IV was on the battlefield at Shrewsbury and nominally in charge, not Henry's brother Thomas - Thomas died in France, not Wales - The field of Agincourt is nothing like to one shown, go have a look if you want to, it's well signposted - Henry ordered the killing of the prisoners after the battle not before it - The Dauphin died of dysentery months after the battle, not on the day - I could go on all day!The real history is exciting enough without the fanciful imaginings of the writer/director getting in the way and remember, a lot of gullible people will watch this film and think it is all true."
719,"This could perhaps have made for some good story telling, if only it wouldn't have included so much historical balderdash.
If you want to distance yourself so much from history, you might as well create a work of fantasy with fictional characters and have them do as you wish. But to borrow historical events and characters, and portrait them in such a ridiculously biased fashion... it's just not right. Betraying not only historical fact, but even the already inaccurate scripts of Shakespeare upon which the movie was based, so completely."
720,"The scenery is good and so is the acting, as many others pointed out, but other than that, it's a pretty doll movie with pretty bad and unbelievable(and not in a good way) fighting scenes.
Maybe if you are a big fan of the genre you will still enjoy it, but for the rest, I will definitely not recommend"
721,"Could have been great, instead its entertaining for those that know nothing of history Or Shakespeare and frustrating for those who do. Oh well, should have known better these days."
722,"""The King"" is a Biography - History movie in which we watch the story of Hal who is crowned King Henry V after the death of his tyrannical father. He has to learn about politics and the war that comes but also he has to control his past and his emotions from his life before becoming a king.I liked this movie very much because it is based on true history events and shows the dark details of not only the palace politics and interests but also behind the relationships and friendships between the people of the palace. I liked very much the interpretation of Timothée Chalamet who played as Hal / King Henry V and he was simply amazing. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Joel Edgerton's who played as Falstaff, Ben Mendelsohn's who played as Henry IV and Sean Harris' who played as William and they were all very good. Regarding the direction that was made by David Michôd, I have to say that it was very good, with much of suspense and action, and it was obvious that he studied the history behind the characters and their relationships between them in order to be correct and the result was this masterpiece."
723,"I have a severe problem with films that purport to depict historical characters and then proceed to script it with only the most thin relationship to historical fact. Henry V has a well documented history and was not the drunkard and wastrel before being elevated to the thrown.The film as fiction was well enough done, but grossly dark on the screen. I had to turn off all lights in the room to watch the picture. The casting of the puny actor as a great hand-to-hand fighter also tested credibility."
724,"Henry the Fifth becomes a little man due to poor editing and worse acting. Anglophiles rejoice.Screenplay.............................. 6 (out of 10)

725,And yet another stupidly and poorly executed parody of the french language. Really amazing that they can't even take a french actor to do it.
726,"This movie was a snooze fest for me, I watched the entire thing in just under an hour"
727,"It's just a big waste to put all this enormous efforts, and magnificent capabilities into such an inaccurately informing film."
728,"A well put together movie. it brings not much special to the medieval genre but does stand strong on the battle scenes. the movie has a high priority for realalism and accuracy, and devlivers on that front. but there is not much emotion sparked throughout the movie. it feels more like a documentary with high budget reinactments.6/10: well made, but kinda boring"
729,"An overall good movie, good soundtrack, great acting, and there is so few movies out there about medieval age history where there is tons of stories to tell about it like this one. But why inserting some free French bashing in it in this interpretation of Charles d'Albret 1 ? This is literally killing the veracity of the movie. Is this because Michod as an Australian feels he needs to take the side of England ? Charles 6 the king was crazy, why not just emphasize this true side of the story ? When you do a movie about history, you stick to the truth, you don't freely interpret it at your convenience."
730,It give me some good game of thrones vibes but also it gave me some bad ones it is solid film
731,"As a thing-in-itself, it is an enjoyable film.I with they'd cut it adrift from any historical or Shakespearean hints.If only they'd set it as a time travel epic, with the King travelling back in time to force 2019 BBC sensibilities and language onto the mediæval idiots who'd got it all wrong.To begin with, I tried looking up dialogue that sounded vaguely familiar, thinking I'd probably misremembered it, but I gave up after a while.I should have realised, with the first 'meet with' that it was 100% opposed to anything historical.I wouldn't want to put anybody off watching it, it is a brilliantly acted costume drama, with the plot and dialogue set in modern times."
