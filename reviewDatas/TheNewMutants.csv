0,"Who said this is Horror ???! After the repetitive promises and tries to release this...thing, it fails. A redundant teenage issues story in a sci-fi mold about young mutants discovering their abilities and (AGAIN) trying escape some sort of a facility. This time the difference is...they are only five of them! wow, yep this is mainly the plot.Clearly we are living the fast money grabbing age and with the epidemic backlash - either socially or financially - big companies don't care for their dedicated fans or even the general audience as they blindly want to make more money.The new mutants and what painfully follows (origin single hero stories, pointless sequels and human vs animated classic reboots) are no exclusion...With a weak plot of a stereotypical teens with issues concept, a very poor atmosphere throughout the whole movie, some plot holes here and there, painfully incoherent accent and of course a predictable story telling!For audience like myself who I know they deserve better...Save your money for something worth and free-stream what you like till the big companies stop being greedy."
1,"I went in with low expectations and yet still left disappointed. I'd like to say something positive but I really can't think of anything right now. The plot, dialogue, characters, acting, cinematography, lighting, everything was just awful.I don't usually take note of accents in movies, if the characterisations are fine then I usually just gloss over them. It says a lot that even I noticed how bad and inconsistent these were.The backstories were glossed over and only partially explored for the most part with glaring holes in most of them.The ""hospital"" setting was not set up, explained, or even logically consistent. If you don't know who is behind it with a certain name drop, then you won't get any answers here.Just bad. Bad and a waste of your time. Watch literally anything else. Go for a walk. Play with your dog. Live life. Don't watch this."
2,"Yeah I'm going to get downvoted for this but I honestly believe that it's WORSE than Suicide Squad. The acting is awful, the CGI looks bad, the characters are unlikable, tons of plot holes and the logic is all screwed up. I could go on all day but I've only seen the first X-men movie, Origins: Wolverine (which I need to rewatch tbh), and the two deadpool movies. So when I'm talking about the logic and plot holes, it's from stuff that is unexplained in the movie since this movie gave me little care to find the whole story of The New Mutants. I'm not against the Lesbian stuff shown at all but it does feel rushed and would have been better kept in the sequel. Oh well, it's just another movie that introduces new characters to replace the old ones since these new characters fit the agenda by Hollywood (Like the Star Wars Sequel Trilogy and Terminator Dark Fate as examples) today except there are no MaREY sues or Gary Stues thankfully."
3,"67.000.000 $ for this crap?! For this money we could shoot 100 movies, and at least 5 of them would be great."
4,"This movie is soulless and dull and so bad, its better off you dont pay this movie any money so we can stop getting stuff like this"
5,"The New Mutants is a movie about 5 teenagers, all of them a stereotype seen in hundreds of movies (the shy girl, the outcast, the rebel, the sexy and the traumatized), that try to survive an ""evil"" experiment of a big corporation. All of that with bad CGi, horrible performances and a pointless script. If this movie was an attempt of a Mavel Horror movie, the only thing scaring enough was the price of the ticket."
6,"@garcwrites: This movie is a slow burn that gives you enough time to get to know the new mutants but it's not very atmospheric. It doesn't put you in the mood, despite the horror vibe of the piece. I never felt anxious, or worried for any of the characters.Even if the tone is a bit of a miss for me, it is a smartly constructed story. I felt I got the characters. I understood their fears, their traumas, and why they were the way we found them on an intellectual level but I hardly felt for them. I can't say that the actors didn't pull their weight, even though they are no oscar worthy performances, but giving that the atmosphere wasn't really there nothing elevated the work they put in.The action scenes and visual effects were great for what they were going for, but in comparison to the sets looked like an expensive new car in a junk yard. The facility they were in is so rundown and cheap looking that I couldn't believe that it had voice activated locks. It would have been easier to believe that the doors opened and closed because of a Mutant's power.The New Mutants felt like a great idea that wasn't totally followed through. There is a gun-shy feeling to it. They didn't go all the way or didn't strike the right tone. The first half of Josh Trank's Fant4stic Four felt more ominous than this entire movie. Unless they going for an intellectual horror superhero movie - if that's a thing - it worked! Because I understood what I was suppose to feel but never experienced any of the emotions."
7,"Would perhaps appeal to teenagers, but not to anyone with a discerning opinion. Inappropriate for young teens and too abysmal for anyone over 18."
8,"See, this is why movies like these should not be PG-13. This should have been rated R."
9,These characters all have some seriously cool backgrounds but it seems like they were all thrown away? Also the concept of Danis powers causing nightmares to be real is really cool but it seems like they didn't use it to the full potential.All in all an alright movie but it felt like a lot of stuff was just forced
10,"However, to make this movie go up to a 1/10 or 2/10, take LSD because it increases the experience."
11,I now know why they kept pushing this movie back. The lead actress could not carry it at all. The fake Kentucky accent was absolutely terrible. Graphics were laughable and not even in a cheesy comic book way. I'm a fan of Anya Taylor Joy and Maise Williams but even their performance were glazed over. I had low expectations and it managed to go even lower.
12,Makes batman and robin and batman forever look like a masterpiece
13,"I was really expecting optimus prime to kill those smiley guys and say ""GIVE ME YOUR FACE"" and josh macdon to scream ""OPTIMUS"" when he's in danger but instead i got this lame piece of trash that isn't fun or cool at all"
14,Worse than mulan 2020 and that movie is also really bad and cringy
15,Dont waste your money and precious time on this trash!
16,This movie is so bad like 5.6 is too generous for this filth. I think we should all give revenge of the fallen a 10/10 because this is so bad.
17,"Personally, I feel that that essence of what it is to be a mutant has been lost"
18,"I thought waiting so long to see this movie would be worth it, but no, it turned out to be a total disaster. The movie hasn't set its tone, sometimes you feel like it's from the horror genre and other times from the superhero genre."
19,The star wars prequels are better than this cringe piece of TRASH
20,This a bad movie. The plot holes you can drive truck through
21,"First of all, this is not """"""okay"""""" LOL. this movie is actually garbage like it's so bad, I would rather watch celebi and exaks adventures over this."
22,"Wow this movie is objectively subjectively and just bad in every way
Also exak stop being silly and lying."
23,"This movie is not worth watching. Its story has no twist and turns but that's not the worst part, the worst part is the acting. There are no actors that match their characters. except for Adam. Maisie Williams is even the worst-performing actress. Don't waste your money."
24,"Watching the movie is like watching the first two episodes of any CW television shows. It introduces the stereotypical teenage characters with issues. It goes on for more than half of the movie. Then it comes to the climax where the new kid loses control over her powers. And then the movie ends. I felt empty afterwards. I waited for years due to the delays...to watch this movie. Anyways, I gave this movie 3/10 because I like Anya Taylor-Joy and Maisie Williams as actresses. And I like the Buffy the Vampire Slayer's ""cameo"" of sorts. Oh wait, Marilyn Manson is credited in this movie. Going down to 2/10."
