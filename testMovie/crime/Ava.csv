0,"Seem to have seen many almost the same films over the past few years. Assassin with military background falling foul of her employers who turn on her. The only difference with this one was there is almost no story, why are people being killed, why turn on such a good operative. I would have walked out but it was raining"
1,"This is classic Hollywood comedy: Actor (played by Jessica Chastain) who also owns the production company (Freckle Films) hires another actor with one hit as a director to direct an action flick written by his actor friend and they get many famous actors to act on it. How hard it is to do an action film with famous actors. It's surely a huge hit.Little they know, the actor-writer is not a good writer and actor-producer is not good at reading scripts as he think he is. Because everyone is friends with everyone, nobody is honest. Hilarity ensues. Experience is tragic for the audience. Comedy for the Hollywood insiders."
2,"SPOILER ALERT
I dont understand why good actors like Jessica Chastain and Colin Farrell took part in this movie. There is no story at all. They fight for no reasons and the fighting scenes are not even enjoyable.
1. The alcoholic background is useless
2. The reason why Simon tries to kill ava is weak
3. The family issue only makes it more of a TV drama
4. Why does Simon kill Duke again?
5. What's the deal with Tony?
6. Why does Ava have to fight the whole club security just to pay Michael's debt? Why?
7. After resisting so hard on drinking alcohol, she finally did it. And what? Nothing happened? The whole movie makes it like something really bad going to happen if she drinks. Well...she drinks and what? She still fights Simon.
8. Simon and Ava fight. Just...wth happened? They just stop fighting? Seriously...Simon just stop trying to kill her and walk away and what? So Ava can have time to chase him with a gun? And why does Simon walk? Oh So he comes to the hotel walking? No car?
9. And for the love of God please stop with the hair! It's so tiring and frustrating to see Jessica Chastain struggle with the hair through the whole movie!"
3,"I like Chastain as an actor bit this is not her genre. This film felt very cheap. The story dull, the direction amateur and the action scenes were really really bad. You could see the fight scenes coming from a mile away. The poor story telling was so bad that the excuses to have a fight we're incredibly lame.I can't explain why so many top actors took part in this cheese fest. I got goose bumps as they had to blurt out their awful lines. The whole thing just felt B-Roll amateur. Not recommended."
4,"The first 30 minutes were really promising.
Good action, suspenseful vibe, great acting... but as soon as one of the secondary character Michael appears, everything flops.
Not only because of his insecure and awkwardly mediocre acting, which reminded me of some cheap drama or love story soap opera... but because he represents an entry point into Ava's past. A boring past which has nothing to add to the story or her character.So if we crop off all the family stuff and stick to the action... then it could be a solid 7.
In stead it is a poor 6.Worth mentioning:
Jessica Chastain and John Malkovich performances are great. Colin Farrell somehow sticks to his (good) average, but who really disappoints is Geena Davis. Her approach personally felt to me like ""Let's make it clear - I'll say some words, get the money and leave."""
5,"I could write and explain the how absurdity bad this movie is - from absolutely incoherent storylines, to fights that are so edited and cut, that they are impossible to understand - but I'm just gonna put this as clear as possible: Don't waste your time.Oh, by the way, a secret assassin's organization would have operatives that are, let's say, good at their job?Andwhoever the choreographer for the ""fight sequences"" was, he/she was definitely not a vet, or even a martial arts fighter with understanding of how a REAL fight flows.Here's to you Colin Farrell, and you Glock with a REFLEX SIGHT and ridiculous suppressor. You stealthy, sneaky, sneaky assassin's."
6,"No real reason for this movie to be made.100% predictable,no likeable characters,no one to root for,chastain kicks ass just about everyone but does not seem strong or body trained,the whole thing is laughable.she also does not possess the star power to like her regardless.boring and stupid."
7,"Paint a black spot on the door of this and walk away at pace. A mercenary cast, not only in the story, assassinating any engagement you may have developed from the start and doing it with some ease - All Very Awful."
8,"The movie is simply horrible. A little non muscular woman overpowers dudes 2-3 times her weight with ease, breaks their bones with punches which even don't seem to tire her, snaps necks like it's nothing. The fighting scenes are pure laughter, scenario or story is simply non existent, the background of characters is non existent. It's really really bad and a total waste of your time. I would also say that it's an insult to waste such goods actors for something like this, strange they didn't aim higher than this."
9,"Female assassin on the run, history of brutal kills, ex military, etc...the list goes on n there r many similar movies. But when u make a movie on a bad ass female assassin pls dont put family melodrama n cliches aft cliches. The hand to hand combat is not choreographed well, the film is devoid of tension n suspense n the worst is the piece of cake assasination plan.
Jessica Chastain aint convincing as an assassin.
As a fan of Colin Farrell, i got disappointed. Well, he is in good shape but the footage is very less.
So ther is a scene wher the character of Chastain is narrating her alcohol abuse n childhood stuff in a group therapy and jus when poor Tony's turn came to share, the camera cut off, how selfish man.
Gena Davis played an assassin in Long Kiss Goodnight n sad to see her in bad condition, very old n with those plastic surgery lips.
The woman who played Chastain's sis (she was ther in Teeth n It) has a very chubby face n poor ol John Malkovich talking as if he is wheezing but he does get to kick some ass."
10,"Pretty fun movie, although Common's acting was very common"
11,Jessica Chastain plays an international hit-woman. John Malkovich is her handler. It sounds like a Luc Besson thriller in the making. It's not. This is a ludicrously hard-to-believe story with soap-opera level writing and stiff performances all around. Everyone has a haunted past... infidelities... alcoholism... gambling addiction... clich√© after clich√©. At no point did anyone convince me of their character. This feels like the first draft in a college freshman's scriptwriting class.
12,This was a terrible movie. There's just no good points in it. The whole thing is a mess. The storyline is all over the place.
13,"The worst movie of 2020. I'm 100% sure the storyline is written by a 5 year old. It made me wonder why great actors participate in such a movie? Not all of them can be broke, no ü§î.
I wanted to give an example that says it all, but actually I already wasted to many words on it..."
14,"In the first 5 minutes, she shuts Peter hand/phone, bullet breaks the window (window cracks..) (it's a movie so we will get pass the fact that they have super eardrums .. ). Ok, she drives on the back left car windows are brand new :D .. sorry I will stop watching here I imagine the rest is just bad too, the movie factory just make quantity over quality.."
15,"Ava Starts AWESOME with great international spy assassin action, though it fast lost heat, getting to the level of a soap opera drama with unbelievable amount of tears that i could not like.It should have stayed on track with action, but no.Still, i can admire the effort and above all the all-star cast, that includes the always beautiful Joan Chen, as well as old time fave John Malkovich who fought pretty good when his time came.Jessica Chastain in her main character role as well as her nemesis Colin Farrell also did a good work, as expected from them.The cast even includes two Oscar winners: rapper Common and the forever gorgeous Geena Davis, who at 64 even looked more elegant and stylish than the much younger Chastain during the scene where the two women played cards.So, as you can infer, cast is not a problem. Problem (in my eyes) was the plot that did make this flick and all action thriller. Because the tears and the telenovela subplot deflate the excitement, preventing the film to reach an awesome peak that would have made it truly memorable. That - sadly - did not happen.Nevertheless, the Ava is acceptable, probably the best in offer in cinemas right now. I'd say it'd be worth of your bucks and time."
16,Same old material been renewed and also a no brainer
17,Just a really bad film from the fighting to the acting. you know what will happen before it dose. she cant fight at all. and the cut seens are so so bad
18,"It's awful. I wrote a review but deleted it because I don't want to waste my words. Only saving grace is the A list talent that signed on to this trash for some reason, and that still couldn't stop me from shutting it off halfway through."
19,"Not sure i agree with the bad reviews. Good acting,Good fight scenes, Watchable roles by solid actors. Bit short and sweet straight to the point movie. Seen a lot worse with huge budgets. Worth your time in my opinion. Defo gets better as it moves along.Enjoy."
20,"Jessica Chastain plays the elusive Ava, who is the top assassin of a shady company. However, as she relapses into alcoholism and a mental breakdown is on the way, the company deems her a liability and wants her gone. In sceneries reminescent of the John Wick movies, like hotel rooms, a flashy nightclub and abandoned church, she fights both physically and mentally to protect herself and the ones she loves.Or at least, that's the premise. In reality this straightforward storyline gets sidetracked a lot by Ava trying to reconcile with her family whom she abandoned, trying to save her ex-boyfriend from bad apples, and Ava's mentor trying to save her. It took the strength and pacing out of the story, and took precious screentime away which I feel could have been used for making Ava's mental ""breakdown"" seem more convincing.
Technically, the movie had some flaws. Unfocused shots at times, the action scenes had an abundance of shaky cams and jump cuts (which I dislike), and digital zoom-ins made the editing just seem... off.However, Chastain was not a bad actress in this movie by any means. She was just one of the top actors in what turned out to be a bit of a B-film."
21,"Is the writing bad because the audience is stupid, or are the writers all a bunch of dorks who do nothing but play video games and watch lousy movies? Either way, this movie is an assault on your intelligence at almost every step. Why do film makers think that the more people who get gunned down in an action scene, the better? An orgy of gunfire and murder are rarely called for, and this over-the-top school of storytelling takes away any sort of tension the scene may have had at one point.First of all, shoot a pistol inside of a car (with the window up!) and if you weren't deaf before, you will be, at least for a while.By my count, she killed 17 people at the hotel in Saudi Arabia, obviously up against The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight. If she had killed two people who happened upon her, it could have been exciting...and believable. 17? Just completely stupid.The rapper guy may look the part, but he's no actor. Whatever, it was a stupid, thankless role. There was already enough drama in the story without adding her personal life, but that's the Hollywood formula machine grinding away.Puerile as the story was all along, the ending went even lower and dumber.Colin Farrell-whose character is a deadly assassin-gets his butt handed to him in hand-to-hand combat by an old man, and then a woman. I don't mean to be ageist or sexist, but have you ever seen a woman or a guy pushing 70 in the UFC? And then when he is in this desperate battle to the death with Ava, they both are sort of chuckling, like this is all good fun. Unless they are both psychopaths, it wouldn't be fun, not even a little. This sort of mirth robs the scene of any tension because they make it out like they are just having fun, instead of being in a fight for their very lives."
22,I don't know why there are so many negatives on this movie. I love it. Jessica Chastain is one of my favorite actresses and John Malkovich is a favorite as well. I like the way her assassin job weaved around her personal life. After seeing this it's clear that Chastain can do action movies. Maybe folks are putting too much microscope on it. I have watched it multiple times and still love it.
23,"I don't know any assassins & hope to never meet one - if you know what I mean.
There are plenty of reviews already so I'll just add what I thought was refreshing about the film & what I thought could've been better.
Most films about assassins - Bourne, Wick, and Atomic Blonde come to mind - depict them as somewhat aloof and mysterious. This film grounds our assassin as someone closer to a real person. A human being with proper foibles who exists among other imperfect people.It's a smaller budget film but the cast is killer (pun intended). Seemed like it was shot fairly quickly but the actual performances are proper top shelf.Ideally the action needed to appear less ""choreographed"". Just as it depicts Eve as a real person, the fights, too, should have been more ""warts n all"".
Felt like I was watching two different movies: gritty American family drama and then a European espionage thriller or Jane Bond 007.
This movie tried to bridge the two genres & that's what I enjoyed most about it."
24,"How and why would you take a hit-man (hit-""person"" to be politically correct) genre that's been done so many times before, screw it up, AND turn it into a soap opera?I mean this whole Michael thing is straight out of ""Days of Our Lives"". Why not create a heartfelt conflict between the sisters and their mom, instead of just seemingly-random cast Common as Michael. Like my heading says, a 5th grader could've written (and directed) this better. I get that actor/trying-to-become-a-writer Matthew Newton is a newb, but to have such an all-star talent line-up, you'd think he would've at least had a seasoned writer proofread the script to avoid embarrassment. His screenplay was riddled with plot and technical issues, it was convoluted, and borderline laughable. Only in the last approx. 15 mins did it grab and hold my attention.To make matters worse, actor/trying-to-become-a-director Tate Taylor failed miserably in directing his cast, and certain scenes were horribly directed. Don't get me started on the lame action scenes. Right from the start, Jessica Chastain was unconvincing as an assassin, and I know in front of a seasoned director, she would've nailed it. Even A-list actors need direction in scenes. With Taylor, her fight scenes were phony, as was her character.I feel really bad for the A-listers having this mess on their resume. This type of filmmaking is more suited for the Steven Seagal and Bruce Willis has-been B-movie type actors. Now, watch seasoned filmmaker Luc Besson's ""Anna"", who cast (as a lead!) never-heard-of amateur actress (in her first-ever acting role) Sasha Luss, and his writing, directing and action scenes will blow your mind, especially compared to this mess! The moral of this story here is, don't blow your money on A-list actors in hopes they will make your film a success; instead, put that money towards film school, then cast a Sasha Luss type newb actor, and you'll have a better chance for a successful film. It's a very generous 6/10 from me - mostly out of pity for the A-listers."
25,"The story is not very new and actual very common. We have seen lots of films about female assassins and surely there were many that were better than this. I must say though that this new interpretation by Tate Taylor was at least quite entertaining, even if it doesnt come close to justify the great talent involved with it. First of all we have Jessica Chastain and an exciting ass kicking role. She was really good in it, giving her character quite some edge and playing it off believably. Nice turn for Chastain who usually shines and those kind of roles. In the supporting cast we have Common who is rather underused. Joan Chen who really needed a better role, she was the most comic-like and an sbsolute stereotype. Colin Farrell was okay but that role did not really require an actor of his caliber as besides some good athletics, Farrell did not really have to show anything off here. Last but certainly not leased there was John Malkovich who made the role better than on the paper so that is at least something. Generally all of them were fine enough for an action film like that. I just felt the film sometimes lost itself in its many subplots without going one clear direction. But yeah as its quite short in running, the time passes well and you won't get bored. There are also some little twists that makes it worthwhile, too."
26,"This is not a bad movie, I've seen bad movies and this is not that. Granted, the characters needed development, but everything else was there.
I don't usually watch fight scenes, but when Jessica Chastain fights, actors are going home with bruises. There were no action doubles, Colin Farrell and Chastain were getting hurt. You cant do krav maga for a week or whatever of shooting and not hit someone accidentally when you're supposed to be just coming close. The fight scenes were pretty vicious.I've never seen John Malkovich do a fight scene before either.
Kind of intense."
27,"A successful thriller with a convincing Jessica Chastain who argues in the best Jason Bourne manner, who does not reinvent the genre but enriches it in an entertaining way.
6,0"
28,"It was enjoyable. Great action scenes and great make up. The acting was on point. But it did feel kinda rushed, i mean it's a 96 minutes film what did you expect, but i didn't get to connect with any of the characters and care for any of them, even Ava.My main issue was that there was no real ending. It felt like I left in the middle of the movie..."
29,"Jessica Chastain does an admirable job sharing screen time with some of the immortals of the last century's box office greats.Geena Davis and John Malkovich both have a long pedigreed of making great films, but give the devils her due, they also made a lot of stinkers as well.This movie isn't a remake of the Long Kiss Goodbye, arguably one of Davis's best movies ever. So it shouldn't be compared as such.is there anything truly new in this film, a resounding NO, but than today their isn't a lot of brand new content out there. If it has been made by American's it likely been made in another language or country.If you are looking for a formula film that has passed the test of time, this will fill your needs. Its got action, suspense, a back story, betrayal and reconciliation. So that's it in a nut shell.Enjoy or don't, but there are really slim pickings out there."
30,"This has gotta be the most boring, plot less movies that I have seen in a long time. There is no plot, it isna TOTAL waste of time. Do not bother with this POS, it is not worth the time it took to write this review. Watch something that you liked 10 times rather than waste a minute on this piece of crap."
31,"I do not understand some of the insensitive reviews given to this amazing movie. Either I am too superficial or that you all are misunderstanding Ava. The movie beautifully depicts the moral issues that Ava, the main character, is encountering, in choosing between what is good and evil, and she is having this wake of consciousness all over her through her contracts to kill people.
Yes... I can almost hear you screaming 'clicheee'. Well to some extent you are right in that every modern action movie is adopting the same plot. But hear me out guys! The movie has none of those inspirational cringe songs which are played gloriously when the main character is beating the living heaven out of the ""bad guy"" (pun intended). The movie starts (kinda) with a scene of Ava quoting Solon, ""Count No Man Happy Until the End Is Known"". And the movie ends with the same quote too, and not in a shabby or clumsy way that many other nth rated movies are choosing to adopt.
The intense emotions between Ava and her mother and their past is absolutely nothing short of delicate. So stop wreaking havoc on this movie man.
Try to adopt a more artistic view when you these movies. Maybe read a book or two on history of philosophy too (Frederick Copleston is my absolute favourite!)."
32,"The first 30 minutes were really promising. Good action, suspenseful vibe, great acting... but as soon as one of the secondary character Michael appears, everything flops.
As for the homicide organization itself, I really like that part with the agent codes, which counts how many homicides someone has committed and how much they get paid for it.
It would be nicer if there was less family stuff and more action. But overall the film is solid and worth a look."
33,"Loved The Long Kiss Godnight and Geena's other action movies. So, when I heard about a kick ass female assassin, I thought she would star.But - she's the grandma in a wheelchair. What a bummer. She could have saved the movie. There's not a single character in this movie you care about."
34,"Start with the name ""Ava"". In Latin it means ""bird-like"" and she's certainly slim and not musclebound. In Greek it means ""life"", and yet her trade is death. In Irish, Ava is the most fearsome warrior, and she certainly is that too.
From the first scenes, Ava is looking for meaning. She's also fighting her personal demons. She's into philosophy and the viewer also needs to see beyond the violence and ruthlessness to the subtle subtext.
Ava is not a killing machine, she feels, she thinks, she struggles. Will she be victorious, or defeated?
I disagree with those reviewers who only see the surface, the action and the battles, and are irritated by the ""gratuitous family scenes"" that don't seem to add to the story. Those scenes are the real story.
Matthew Newton knows what he's writing about. The top-flight cast signed on because they saw what the story was really about, and chose to be part of it.
Read between the lines and see the movie for what it is, not what the movie poster suggests it looks like."
35,Jessica Chastain can flawlessly perform the toughest roles. She takes this film from mild drama to insane action in the blink of an eye. The supporting cast is an ensemble of A+ actors. Film is really good and the poor ratings from others has zero merit.
36,"Totally competent addition to my favorite genre, ""the bad ass woman who beats the crap out of everybody."" The cast is great and Jessica has the acting chops to sell the action and the emotional roller coaster her character is on. Which is good because this film has a ton for her to shoulder. She's an assassin, an addict in recovery having a rough week featuring a crisis of faith about her work, trouble with her boss because she is questioning her assignments, a job going spectacularly bad, then a trip back home to reconcile with family she walked away from, a past love, also an addict, now with her sister. And she has daddy issues. But, get out of her way! There's nothing Jessica can't solve with her fists, her feet, a gun, harsh language and a full clip. Included is a John Wick nightclub moment. My wife watched the whole thing, without wandering away, and had one complaint. She said Jessica should have put more time in at the gym like Charlize Theron did for Old Guard."
37,"A bad review, this is a good film, perhaps there was some predictability, but overall I liked this movie, the end predicts a sequel and I hope there is, for me, the cast did good work in this film."
38,"By day, she is known as Ava Falkner. By night, she might as well be known as Mrs. John Wick, due to the exuberant fight sequences that are part of her profession as a hired assassin.Jessica Chastain is outstanding in the role of the badass Ava. Her handler named Duke (John Malkovich) is disappointed in Ava's human concern about her victims because she is not supposed to know anything about their identities and their crimes.In a dynamic opening scene outside Le Bourget airport in Paris, Ava gets the job done on a corrupt financier. Her next assignment is in Riyadh, where she is to assassinate a German general and make it appear as though he died of natural causes. But she is being set up by her employer, Simon, who is the godfather of the Murder, Inc. enterprise.After Duke is brutally killed by Simon, Ava is on her own to deal with Simon and his family members. At the same time, Ava must protect her mother, Bobbi, and her sister, Jude, an expectant mother. A love interest in the film that was underdeveloped was between Ava and Michael, who linked up with Jude after Ava had left him years ago.The most touching scene in the film was between the mother and the daughter over a game of cards. Bobbi opens up to her daughter about how she had once betrayed her, choosing the word of her philandering husband over that of her daughter. The betrayal sent Ava into a bout of alcoholism and a long recovery period. The card game scene was beautifully performed by Chastain and Gena Davis as Bobbi.There were exciting location settings, as well as interesting camera angles on the part of the director. The screenplay included a group of colorful characters. One figure who may be important in the sequel is the daughter of Simon, who is last seen stalking Ava on the streets of Boston. But this film belongs to Chastain for her dynamic interpretation of Ava.The filmmakers wax philosophical in the ancient Greek tale of Croesus, who was told by Solon that of human happiness, ""Count no man happy until the end is known."" In the film, the meaning was skewered by focusing on the last moments of one's life. But the actual theme is that the merits of one's life as a whole may not be judged until the very end when an entire set of choices in life may be added up.In the film, we don't yet know the final results of the life of Ava Falkner. The filmmakers clearly have a sequel in mind before arriving at the wisdom of Solon."
39,"Intelligent drama part with onion layers of personalities being revieled. The action part were a bit too predictable for my taste, though Jessica and the other lead characters were superb. Jessica Chastain shines like a diamond when she does intelligent drama roles, in this movie she's more a Swarowsky. Nice but not the real thing. I give the movie a SIX, for Colin Farrel, Geena Davis and of course John Malkovich does brings light to the Swarowsky and makes it sparkle a bit more."
40,"I love Jessica Chastain. Great actress. The movie was ok, it could have been much better. Music, directing needed something else. Storyline could also improve. Such a great actress wasted."
41,"I saw ""Ava"", starring Jessica Chastain-X_Men:Dark Phoenix, The Martian; John Malkovich-Space Force_tv, Warm Bodies; Geena Davis-Grey's Anatomy_tv, The Long Kiss Goodnight and Colin Farrell-Artemis Fowl, Horrible Bosses.
This is an action tale about a female assassin that works for a black ops organization. Jessica is the hit woman-person? certainly not a hit man-that was trained by John, who is now her handler. Jessica has mostly high profile targets-who would suspect a woman?-but she has a problem. She likes to talk to her victims before she kills them. Basically, she wants to know why they are being targeted for her skills and Colin-her boss-doesn't like that. He puts a termination protocol on her and that's when things get interesting. Geena plays Jessica's estranged mother. They have some unresolved issues. There is a lot of good action and fight scenes; Jeff Imada is the stunt choreographer and he was trained in Jeet Kune Do-among other fighting techniques-and has been in and choreographed a lot of movies you would know; Batman V Superman:Dawn of Justice, Fast & Furious movies, Bourne movies, Big Trouble in Little China and They Live, just to name a few.
It's rated ""R"" for violence, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 36 minutes.
I really liked it and would buy it on Blu_Ray."
42,"Ava (Jessica Chastain) is an Assassin working for a Black Ops organization called The Company headed by Simon (Colin Farrell). Ava likes to ask her marks if they know what they did and deserve to die because of it, and this rankles Simon who feels she is a liability and wants her dead. Ava's Handler, Duke (John Malkovich), does his best to protect Ava and wants Simon to rescind the Kill Order.This is a little different Assassin story as we see some Soap Opera stuff thrown in with Ava's family who she hasn't seen in 8-years. Even so you must know by now that I like Assassin movies and even some bad ones are still good enough for me. That said, this is a very good one with a mix of Soap Opera family stuff and keeping Ava alive when Simon wants Ava dead. Oh, Ava is a former Alcoholic with PTSD.Notables: Common as Michael, Ava's ex from long ago and now engaged to Ava's sister Judy (Jess Weixler); Joan Chen as Tony who runs a gambling operation and Michael is on the hook to her for $80,000 and Ava will try to get him free of Tony; Geena Davis as Bobbi, Ava's mother. Diana Silvers as Camille, Simon's wife.As we go along we have all the confidence in Ava and she is in the class of other Assassins: Ana, The Red Sparrow, and, of course, John Wick among others. So do we miss the tension and suspense that is not in here? No, but some of the fight scenes do have us questioning who will be the victor.I do hope that John Malkovich does more movies in any capacity. He is always more than good and deserves an Oscar just for appearing in any story, just like Woody Harrelson. Enough said.Now at the end when we see Ava walking away and we see a girl following her and we think it may be Camille, but no, it is the girl we saw on a motorcycle who listened in to Ava and her mark in the beginning of the movie, but we never saw her again until now. So for a moment we thought there may be a sequel, but we think not. But a sequel would be welcomed anyway. (9/10)

43,"I was gonna rate this EPIC movie a 7ish at first until the very end, then bam, totally unexpected ending! You can clearly see that Tate Taylor, the director is Heavily influenced by such greats as Sam Peckinpah & John Woo. Matthew Newton, the writer nailed this masterpiece with his very believable scenarios and characters. Geena Davis plays an awesome supporting roll. It is my opinion that Jessica Chastain is one of the best female action stars of our day. When watching this awesome movie, do not over think it, just enjoy it."
44,"As bland as an avatar
Great cast
Poor script
Poor direction
Awful choice to sit through a cliched movie
Much better movies that it tries to copy:
Any Bourne movie (the original cool assasin...)
John Wick (ask Common!)
And any tired rehash of a Liam Neeson movie.....This movie is a waste of time!"
45,"I didn't think it was as bad as most of these reviews say it is.
Is it formulaic? YesIs it unnecessarily heavy and melodramatic? YesAre there silly and contrived plot holes? YesAre the fight scenes ridiculous and unrealistic? YesBut most action movies are, and do have such nonsense. (Especially with female leads.)Reviewers are complaining Jessica Chastain is too small and skinny to be beating up men. And then they want to compare her to Charlize Theron. Charlize Theron is skinnier than Jessica Chastain. So is Angelina Jolie. It's usually ridiculous when women beat up men. But hey, that's the movies.Jessica Chastain is beautiful, a good actress, and I think she did a good job with the fight scenes. Jess Weixler and Dianna Silvers are beautiful also.
(Geena Davis was always ""meh"" to me. Even in ""Thelma and Louise"". Good movie but Geena Davis was nothing special.)I saw the ratings before I watched it. And being it is an action movie, I wasn't expecting much. I wasn't disappointed.You want to be entertained by a silly action movie with beautiful women? I think 6 is a good rating."
46,"As a stand alone film it is a bit weak, hence my score. But as a Jessica Chastain vehicle for a new TV show I could be convinced to add a couple points. But the question is whether they could bring something new because we already have the excellent 2010 Nikita and of course Alias.I think there was plenty of great acting and Jessica Chastain carried the film well. The fight scenes were reasonable, nothing spectacular however.A lot was wrapped up in the ending but they did leave an opening as well. I feel like the budget was in the tens of millions and so I hope there is a sequel or a TV show in the works if it makes some money back..."
47,"I just like ""girls kicking ass"" films so this was kinda fun. The story has serious holes in it, I know, but if you like a little ""girls kick ass"" films, this is entertaining to that end."
48,I saw this film with my girlfriend and it was thrilling.
49,"Headline says it all. Decent femme spy film to fill an evening. It tries to have a point of difference and does, but it isn't unique or authentic enough to score higher. Disengage brain and enjoy."
50,"I'm usually a fan of these types of international woman spy/assassin types of movies. Most of them all have the standard plot of the woman is deep down really not that bad and turn good in the end after getting revenge on those in charge. This one is the same but really the action wasn't that great, no exotic locales, pretty mundane family conflicts. All in all a below par movie of the genre."
51,I guess this is an attempt at a female driven action movie but its a total faceplant.The lead tries hard enough but at least get in shape for the role. She doesn't seem like she could peel a banana let alone take out dozens of armed men.Little girls could get empowered etc which I suppose is the point but overall this could have been far better.
52,"I am reading people's reviews and I keep seeing people writing""there is no story at all, people fight for no reason, her drunk background is not necessary"" and it dawned on me that people skipped the intro. And the part about her drunk background, it contributed much to her story. For crying out loud, her files explain why she joined the military and ended up as an assassin. Her file said she was a good soldier but also a liability because of her behavior and that explains why she was attacked. The Duke was killed in defense of his favorite protege. For Christ sake I can't believe I have to explain this to people-why some events happened in the movie.
If one pays attention, you will realize that the intro gives all the background info there is to know about Ava and the actress did her best to portray these qualities. My point exactly is people perhaps didn't see that part of the movie and therefore couldn't appreciate it. Also if you watched the intro and careful taken your time to read her files, you'll realize that everything adds up. In order words if you skipped that side of the movie, then don't watch the movie at all."
53,"I really wanted to like this movie. I'm very fond of Jessica Chastain John Malkovich, and Colin Farrell. Great acting overall, but I have to say I thought Chastain was miscast. I don't think she had the gravitas to pull this off, just wasn't convincing to pull off the physicality, not enough muscularity, too slight a body, just wasn't convinced when she went to battle with these tough guys, that what I was seeing was real.I felt that the movie lacked choreography, especially the first half with the rapid fire shots, all with all the action taking place, you were never really sure exactly what she was doing to take these guys down. In the second half it evolved into some more articulated fight scenes. However, there was way too much family drama. The sister was unbelievably annoying. The mom? Eh? Common? An actor with his chops and presence, should be given more to work with.I would say it was moderately entertaining, but not particularly convincing. It is not a bad film, it's just not a particularly good film. As much as the ending hinted of a sequel, I seriously doubt that will happen. She is no Jason Bourne!"
54,"This was a dull dull film! The cast, outstanding - on paper. Together? On film? yeah I started looking for Hannah on Netflix after a while to stop myself falling asleep! Please don't sequel this film using the same writers. Please DO NOT!!"
55,"I watched this without reading any reviews first, and was glad I did - I probably would not have watched it otherwise. In my opinion, it does not deserve the bad reviews at all. Granted, it's not a superlative gem of a movie, but it definitely has its qualities. We watched it in a group, and all agreed that it was a good action movie.Personally, I liked the fact that the female lead (Jessica Chastain) is not infallible, nor indestructible. In fact, she gets thrown around a lot, which is a lot more realistic than the usual indestructible characters. As a killer, she re-discovers her conscience, and primarily thinks of her friends and family. As a result, the movie had a realistic feel to it, which made it more enjoyable. The ending was also good, without being hollywood cheesy.Will recommend this for a good action movie."
56,"I love the cast, I pretty much hate everything else. It was a waste of time to watch this."
57,"Common was great, as always. But his role would have been better if Logan Paul had been cast. Couldn't really focus on the plot because I was do other things around the office ( tax season, ugghhh, lol ) but will watch when I have time."
58,"Ava is a new crime thriller movie directed by Tate Taylor, The Help director, The Girl on the Train and Ma.Ava (Jessica Chastain) works as a hit man for a black ops organization. For this she travels the world to eliminate the highest members of hostile organizations. If Ava receives the wrong information during a mission, the mission will end wrong. For example, she is put on non-active by the black ops organization. Because of this, Ava withdraws from family and tries to resume her personal life. When she learns that her boss has planned an attack on her for the mistake she made on her last mission, she must now protect herself from a loved one from the black ops organization.This movie has a standard story for a crime thriller. For those familiar with crime thrillers, the film can quickly come across as familiar and somewhat predictable. The film is completely predictable when you have seen the trailer, because it actually shows the entire film. To enjoy the movie a little more, you better try to avoid the trailer.Jessica Chastain does a good job in the lead role of the film, but she has acted better in other, better films. Colin Farrell also made them acting as the boss of the black ops organization. His character does not really come across as a dangerous threat to the hero of the story and so there is no real extra tension in the film."
59,"Enjoyed the film. Suspenseful and open for a sequel. In the genre of Nikita, Borne and Hanna."
60,"This is a solid film, yes the premise has been done many times but the execution is different. I enjoy different foods but I also go back to burgers or pizzas because I like them and they are good. Same old but I may try different flavours and ensembles. This is exactly what this film is, a different flavour of a similar genre.During lockdown people must have gone bonkers to give good movies ratings of 1 and 2. I honestly have no idea why this has any rating lower than a 6. We are talking 1 to 10, so a decent film must receive 6 7. This is a good action film and it kept me interested, didn't feel the need to play on my phone as it happened with other highly rated films.It has good actors, good action scenes, good story and whatever else is needed for a good receipe. I was looking for an easy good action movie and I got it. Didn't need to get mindfu**d or leave me make up the ending, not an Oscar movie... just pure fun. Bloodshot got just as many bad ratings and again, I don't get it.You want a good action film a la Bourne go for it, and then give it at least a 6 cause it deserves it. The story is solid, it explains clearly why things happen, why she asked the questions and what the repercussions were so whoever said it doesn't explaint it, clearly wasn't paying attention and who the hell analyses action films, are you looking for a realistic spy/assassin movie? Should probably not watch any James Bond then:)) The film is not driven by stupidity, by doing things for the cause of moving the script along.Again, it is a good spy/assassin action film."
61,"IMO, fuggedabout all these one/two star reviews,
this movie starring Jessica Chastain was petty darn
good and as ""Maximus"" once asked ""Were you entertained?""
well yes I was for a good 90 minutes or so.For those who are complaining about the plot, Researchers found
many years ago after reviewing thousands of movies going back
100 years - that there are only about '8' plots/stories in the movie world;
imagine that. So don't expect anything original, just sit back and watch.Interesting (for me) to see/hear Joan Chen (from one of my fave movies
'Taipan') and John Malkovich (who was excellent), Colin Farrell did ok.
Geena Davies played the taciturn mom alright also.Again, seems that female revenge movies are all the rage (de rigeur)
right now; check out 'Peppermint' with Jennifer Garner and ""Chocolate""
from back in 2008, for more badazz ladies. I give 'Ava' a well deserved 7/10."
62,"I cringed to see colin Farrell in it. Watching Ava's final journey hitting the bottle and despairing into the sadness & madness was very touching & well portrayed before her epic battle royale. The final fight scene AVA nailed it really brought the film up top notch, not sure I liked seeing her followed by Farrells daughter in end though, not sure that added up or not"
63,"Not a bad movie, felt it was too slow. Action scenes were pretty good, but i give it a 6 out of 10 stars."
64,"Ever since Tabacco advertising was banned. The female lead in most Netfix films is a smoker. She will be beautiful like Chastain. Although her being a smoker adds nothing to plot or character. I assume the tabacco industry is funding these films.
."
65,Jessica Chastain is the leading lady of hollywood and she proves her worth by single handedly saving this film. The plot is good and entertaining and while it's not an edge of the seat kind of thriller but it does the job. Changing the name from Eve to Ava was rather bizarre decision at very late but they managed it well. If you are a Jessica Chastain fan you will definitely enjoy this film but others may find it less amusing.
66,"Good entertainment. The action scenes could be better. Don't expect too much from the script: the movie is full of clich√©s, poor dialogue and totally predictable. But still, it's a movie that doesn't bore so much. Good for those hours when you have nothing to watch."
67,"The plot did not have many surprising elements. However, the fight scenes and the wonderful acting of Jessica Chastain made it a very enjoyable movie to watch."
68,"I just love how Jessica Chastain play. Great actress.
Movie is predictable, but I enjoy in her transformations."
69,"A lot of action some very good fights a good scenario jessica chastain is very good
so why many peoples don't like this movie ?
it is a mystery
for me i enjoy it too much and i will watch it again and again for sure"
70,"Although only a supporting role, Geena Davis really pulled off some great scenes and had some good chemistry with Jessica Chastain, I really enjoyed their interactionsI don't know why people are giving this 1/10 - sure it's been done before to some degree, but a 1? That seems strange. The action scenes were solid, there were definitely a few 'wow' moments and 'did she just do that?' scenes. I think some people are just unhappy with their lives and take that out on movie reviews, it's a little sad actually.Anyway, I would definitely recommend. A solid 8."
71,"I enjoyed this movie, and Jessica Chastain was awesome! :DGood action flick. Good acting, Likeable, fairly believable characters. Good pacing that kept me gripped.Check it out, it's cool and fun!(P.S. I don't understands all the negative reviews. Sure it's not a masterpiece, but it wasn't bad. Hehe. )"
72,"You would think after seeing all the stars that are in this movie it would be at least somewhat decent right? Jessica Chastain ruins it. The other movie I saw with her in it ""Molly's Game"" was kinda ruined by her acting as well."
73,This is a pretty cool film with a well known cast. The fights are intense but believable. I enjoyed it.
74,Stop putting Common in movies. He has the charisma and acting ability of wet paint!
75,"Great cast, run of the mill story.
Definitely think some of them had a slow year and bills to pay"
76,I have to admit that streaming platforms have brought down the standard of cinema. This movie has big stars but a pathetic weak plot.
77,"This movie was so awful it inspired me to break a habit of a lifetime and write a review. It is my penance for failing to read the reviews of others, which would have warned me.There isn't really a plot, but what little plot there is is (a) mind-numbingly boring and (b) makes no sense.The acting is poor, but probably mostly because the script is so dire. The big name actors were doing their best, I'm sure, but the lines they had to deliver made it impossible to portray characters we could believe, much less identify with. Nothing about any of the characters made us care about them.The gratuitous violence, which served no plot purpose, and for which no reasons were offered, was therefore like unskillful dancing: lots of activity but no reason for anyone but the participants to bother paying attention.Really. Save your time. Watch something else. Or read a book. Don't watch this.P.S. I have to tick a box answering if my review contains spoilers. It couldn't. Nothing of the slightest interest actually happens in this movie."
78,"Utter tripe. Cliches left right and centre, unconvincing characters, yawn fest of a plot. What Colin Farrell and Jessica Chastain are doing anywhere near a film like this is beyond me."
79,"This is the story of a woman who kills people for money. It is hard to predict the next scene. The action and fighting scenes are well-directed. I liked the background music. I liked the movements of the camera. Jessica Chastain was awesome. Colin Farrell was very good as always. However, I know that this is only 20% of Colin's talent. He didn't have that much play in the story. In summary, if you are a fan of action movies, this will be a nice pick for you."
80,"I read the, mostly bad, reviews after watching the film. Yes it is a cliched story and I think the family problems sub-plot slowed it down a bit, but otherwise it was a well made film and IMO it was/is an entertaining one and a half hours."
81,"Well, while the 2020 movie ""Ava"" does have some overly-used clich√©s for this particular type of movie, it actually still turned out to be a rather enjoyable and entertaining movie.I sat down to watch the movie initially because it had John Malkovich and Colin Farrell on the cast list. And it was more than pleasing to also see the likes of Geena Davis, Ioan Gruffudd and Joan Chen make appearances in the movie. I must admit that I was especially fond of Joan Chen's character, just a shame that she didn't have more screen time. Now, I can't claim to be overly familiar with lead actress Jessica Chastain, but she really carried the movie well with her performance here.""Ava"" provides a good amount of action and character development at the same time, while it spices it up with a pinch of drama and thrills. I actually enjoyed the storyline told in this movie by writer Matthew Newton, though it definitely had some generic elements for this particular genre of movie. But it was at the same time interesting and fresh enough to actually get past those clich√©s.Sure, the storyline was predictable, and there weren't actually any surprises along the way. But while the movie was as it turned out to be, I found it to actually not be any less entertaining given that factor.You know what you are in for when you sit down to watch a movie such as ""Ava"" from director Tate Taylor, but something the predictable serving can be a good thing.I enjoyed this movie, thus I am rating it a six out of ten stars."
82,"I can't stop thinking of the amazing resemblance of Ava (Jessica Chastain) in the movie and her mother (Geena Davis). Having forgotten the actual age of Davis, I actually thought she was doing a dual role.Well, that aside, it was a good movie. I've seen a lot more action movies that are much slower, less engaging. This one will get you drop anything else you've been doing in parallel perhaps. The cast is impressive, worthy of any major movie. The story line is not particularly inventive but it carries a few interesting twists and character developments.I'd say - press play and enjoy!"
83,I love Gina Davis. To date she's played the best female assassin in film. The Long Kiss Goodnight. This was entertaining. Done very well.
84,"This film start with a woman ""Ava"" picking up a man ""Peter"" at the airport, and she kill the man scene! As turnout, this film is about a black ops organization leader ""Simon"" want to eliminate Ava, because he thought Ava is the liability of the organization! Entire film full of boring conversation! All the shooting, and stabbing scene have blood at certain point, but overall quite messy, not satisfy, and too short! The martial art fighting scene have things broken at certain point, but overall quite slow, not satisfy, and too short! Barely laughable scene is, Ava want to copulate, and runaway with Michael, but Michael saying Ava's sister ""Judy"" is pregnant! At the end, Ava shot Simon at the head to kill him! That's it! Another disappointed film!"
85,"Excellent Action movie, not particularly complicated but it's definitely entertaining"
86,An absolutely atrocious movie with a painfully bad story line. One of the worst I've watched from start to finish.
87,"I just enjoy the genera of woman assassin's, seeing Gina Davis just pull back memories from the long kiss of goodnight, I really enjoyed the movie with all the drama and action, I just need so much more information I need the second part, I felt this was only the start."
88,"I like ""besson"" films, but also i like films.
Some like horror, some i see, but mostly don't, does that make me rant about them? bash the movie into the ground because it is not my cuppa tea? Call it respect.About this movie
There's action, there's dissapointment.
Some reviewers think they have the power of knowledge, but i doubt them.
So i watched, I loved the ""reality"", that's lately in more movies.
That the main character, is badass and isn't.
I watched it till the end, and yes it is worth my time.
It is not a Marvel movie. It is not a film noir.
It is a movie that could be based on real events.I liked it, don't care about these amateur critics that start crying after 5minutes, that's not a critic, that's childish, period.Acting is not triple A, but that's the addition that it made me feel like a portion of realism.
Some scene's look like the person is just stupid, but that is just the thing that happens a lot in real life, doesn't it?The only negative i could write is, it is a ""watch at home"" movie, but that's also a plus for me."
89,"I hope Chastain will not ""Rambo"" herself. After some success Stalone became writer, producer, director and his films just suck. Chastain is so talented and motivated to explore her options, but she is a bit over-involved here. This actor ""Common"" is just terrible. He is a bad actor. There is no chemistry anywhere near him. The sister is not very good either. The story of the feamale assassin betrayed is a bit tired, but Chastain is so great it is always worth watching her jhourney in all of its parts. If she would have refrained from producing, this could have been better. At any rate she is always a pleasure to watch and having a taste of Geena Davis is a bonus point."
90,A forgettable script with terrible casting choices is rescued by Chastain who basically carries the entire film by herself.
91,"Great acting.
Interesting story. Drama, spying, action... It's not boring at all. It's believeable.
Overall good action scenes, some moves won't survive UFC common sense but they are totally tolerable."
92,"I watched because I'm a Jessica Chastain and Malkovich is always good. Even in this. However the movie goes downhill immediately with the appearance of the ever underwhelming Ioan Guffold whom I've haven't forgiven for his abominable performance in Fantastic 4.The plot is convoluted. Awkwardly oscillating between family problems, professional problems, and a devastating case of terrible casting.Jess Wexleir is not believable either as a sister or a singer. Sadly Gina Davis is long on implants and collagen and short on acting skills these day. But Common really sinks this boat.Feels like such a step down for Chastain and Ferrell."
93,"People on here writing reviews like they are professional well paid film critics, and not just like everyone else here, sat on the sofa or cinema chair eating crisps passing the time. Stop trying to be clever. Review it give your opinion, and move on."
94,"Ignore the negative reviews - I have no idea why people are slating this. There is absolutely a storyline (pay attention during the opening credits), the cast is stellar and the action sequences are excellent. There is emotional complexity in this movie that average action thrillers don't usually depict. It's not perfect but give it a shot! I found it pretty enjoyable."
95,"I was quite thoroughly entertained by this gem of a movie. Contained enough elements in the plot to hold my attention until the very end. Apart from the incredible action scenes, it is also a story about family and loyalty, among other things. Jessica Chastain is well-suited for this role and her supporting cast did an amazing job as well. Would highly recommend seeing this movie."
96,"Wow - this one grabs you from the word ""go""!! great effort by the lead to show the conflict and skill involved. It has been said that if you kill one there are two graves you must dig. This shows the weight of those actions. Love the players too from the bad guy to her boss to her sister -- all perfect for their rolls, very believable. Common is terribly miscast. The confused politics take away from the whole effort of the project. The action scenes are the highlight of the story. Wow - must be the director of JOHN WICK or BOURNE because these are tight, and right. Of course, the old ""um, they just broke her ribs and now she is climbing a rope"" argument is valid here. But overall, loved this movie. Would recommend"
97,"I really enjoyed this movie. I was more happy that there was a story mode instead of endless killing. The actress who plays Ava is absolutely HOT. Who knows, a follow up in the Making?"
98,"A wonderfully combined drama with an action thriller.
It is about a hit man who works for an independent agency, who due to mismanagement wants to dismiss her from the position, while facing her harsh family life.
Entertaining
Quality.
Good action sequences, good effects and shots, well-executed stunts. Only two moments are not well achieved, but the rest are.
It combines history with action in a wonderful way.
Performances at the level.
Jessica Chastein shines on the screen.
Leaves the sale open to a sequel.
Good soundtrack.
While the opening credits are there, she handles interesting data about the character, so as not to lose sight of them.
You sense most of the things, but they give the film its own style, even though we have seen women this tough, they have their own thing."
99,"The storyline is predictable. I thought the Jessica Chastains acting was spot on. Personally I found the twist of a black ops assassin/spy that has to go to group and has issues just like the rest of us, a bit refreshing. It's a mindless escapism flick; take it for what it is and don't over think it."
100,"Ava Faulkner (Jessica Chastain) is a paid assassin from Boston. If you miss her quick bio during the opening credits they recap it at her AA meeting. She gets her orders from John Malkovich. After a hit that has gone awry, Ava becomes a liability to the company.Half the film is a drama about Ava's family. Geena Davis plays her mother and Jess Weixler is her sister. Common is her sister's boyfriend and her ex-boyfriend with a gambling problem. Chastain and Malkovich is a must-see for me in any film. They did a great job.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
101,"Ava need to make another part of his life,
how they can end this organization....."
102,"Jessica Chastain was great The overall scenes, action and characters were allright. The plot was allright, but it felt like there was a bit too much irrelevant stuff going on."
103,"I watched it yesterday and was pleasantly impressed with the fight sequences and Jessica Chastain's performance. It was a pretty straightforward action thriller executed well. It wasn't about another assassin who wants to retire due to some trauma. It was fairly gripping and had some nice surprises on the way. There are two sides to the story: Ava's assassin life and her family life. The film balances both of them well for the entire duration. Another thing that deserves a special mention is the cinematography: it's good to see the camera not shaking too much during the fight scenes and the choreography being impressive at the same time. In short, Ava is just fun and then some. If you like raw action, give this film a watch."
104,"The premise of this movie is so poorly thought-out, the actors executing it never stood a chance.It's idiotic, rushed and lacking any real logic.A highly trained assassin, who's a recovered drug-addict (and alcoholic?), is being hunted by the group she works for because she's been talking to targets before assassinating them...The questions surround the motive or reason as to why her group has ordered the hit, because like so many highly trained assassins our recovered drug addict is questioning the professional ethics of her employer...Oh and her ex-boyfriend is engaged to her sister in a weird, pointless sub-plot."
105,"*** SPOILER ALERT ***Chastain is fantastic, and I'm a huge fan of Malkovich AND Farrell... But this movie is so simplistic and over-the-top... When she has to fight her way out of trouble, and overpowers / out-fights / out-shoots more than a dozen German soldiers, the movie already starts to strain... All these soldiers are presumably as well trained as our hero (a former soldier). I nearly hurt myself from the eye-rolls.After that, it's a string of cliches.... The writing just feels lazy."
106,"Despite the rather low average score this is quite a nice action movie, especially as there are a couple of great actors in it."
107,"I've seen a lot worse movie. I wouldn't call it bad - I enjoyed the acting. It feels like a story I've seen before, and a little messy story (too many unimportant details), and it might be more of a drama with a small but of action. A movie about a troubled woman.It's a fine movie, i wouldn't recommend it, but I wouldn't not recommend it!
Great fight scenes, okay storyline.I don't get why people are confused? The storyline is pretty straight forward, maybe with too many side stories.6/10 - would watch once."
108,"This is a decent attempt of a thrilling action film. It is like a female Jason Bourne minus the amneaia that stars the ever watchable Jessica Chastain (Ava). It also has the big old timers such as John Malkovich (Duke), Geena Davis (Bobbi) & Colin Farrell (Simon).The premise is that Ava is a paid assassin that murders high profile people/politicians/traders etc that are seemingly corrupt. Her handler is Duke and they work for a collective group known as the ""company. She has reservations about the ""targets"" and starts questioning whether or not she is given false narratives. This will be her downfall...The chaos and secretive nature of her job is juxtaposed against her social life where she had had a troubled life with family before she joined this company. She is a recovering alcoholic and her sister is now dating her ex boyfriend. Cue the family conflict and tension & also their mother has recently been hospitalised... Due to her work she managed to have disappeared from their lives for 8 months.Overall, the writers are trying to bring some added depth to the clich√©d assassin character with some interesting family dynamics. It felt like the film focused more on this aspect which may be off putting for viewers that expect a different type of film."
109,"I was excited to watch a movie with such a great cast, in particular during the pandemic, as we don't get to see a lot of new movies, But infortunately, this is bad... really bad.
The fight scene are slow and you almost feel like that are repeating the moves while filming it. They try to make Jessica Chastain do some John Wick moves, but it's just not believable and not only for her. The gun fight are ridiculous, the bad guys run to her gun and die one after another.
But even without that, it's an extremely predictable movie, poorly writen, full of clich√© with only unlikable characters, starting with Ava.
You can watch this movie if there are nothing else but don't expect to be really entertained...."
110,"Don't know why we need one more of this kinda add-ons to the genre and contents that we've already seen thousand times. The thing that I don't buy into it is that black character's involvement in this almost pure white movie. He's just out of place, a check-n-balance arrangement to show that Hollywood is really trying to put the minority actors in a pure white background movie. But that character simply couldn't be just forcefully inserted into this storyline, not just there's no chemistry between these two early love birds, even there's nothings existed between her sister and the black guy. They just looked like strangers to one another or to each other. It just looked so unnatural and so awkward to jam a character out of nowhere and to force that guy into the churning pot.The leading actress did a great job but not quite convincingly believable. The fighting scenes were more like those Kung Fu movies in 1960 to 1970 out of Hong Kong. Any guy who has watched UFC will not believe anything of it. A feather wt. female fought the light heavy wt or middle wt. males? That's massacre, man. It could only happen in movies, not in the real world."
111,I really liked this film!! Very good action sequences and Geena Davies as the Mum was Fab! The acting was good. A very action packed film.
112,It's a nice action movie deserves much more ratings than one given to it. For me it's 7.5 to 8 stars
113,"The plot unfolds slowly,, am in love with chastin, whether we have seen same plot, malkovich and common bring out family value,, put in some drama and action, AVA is worth watching."
114,"So Management is super-mad at her because she asks the people she's about to kill what they did wrong? How about a little freedom for the assassin? I guess it could be a sign of a future fall-down, but sending your daughter across the world to spy on your assassin, only to find out she DID ask him what he did wrong?!? Must be against some assasin's code I'm not aware of.Common's acting was a bit cringy at times, I'm always skeptical about rapper-turned-actors. Wouldn't more practice fix those small issues? Geena embodied annoying Mom energy, and the sister pulled off annoying sister pretty good. Malkovich, Farrell and Chastain made it work for me."
115,"Think bad soap opera with the occasional poorly choreographed fight scene. I don't know why any of these actors would take this job. From cheesy lines to poor cinematography, nothing about Ava is worth the investment in time to watch."
116,I disagree about the criticism of the wrong casting. Aside from Common who was terrible. and it was nice to Geena Davis casted.I think the problem with this is that it didn't know what it wants to be. On one hand it's a family drama on another an assassin action thriller. Unless it's going to be 3 hours long I don't see how you can put the two together coherently and also have a John Wick style kick ass roller coaster to keepnthe blood lust alive.Overall not bad but not brilliant. Worth a free viewing on Netflix.
117,Entertaining and violent in a messy enjoyable fast paced way. Acting was fine and good. Except for Common. He should remain a TV actor. But all in all well worth your time.
118,"I kinda liked this movie! Its not very original, because there are many movie like this: Anna, Peppermint etc but it was higly entertaining. I didn't loose interest the whole movie and wasnt bored. Good acting, great cast, interesting storyline."
119,It was spectacural but i felt like it didn't have a very big story.
120,"16 minutes in and the opening ""song"" is STILL playing. I use quotes because its not a song, its obviously thrown together loops on auto pilot. I could watch no more because I foresee it being a recurring theme throughout the film. whoevers in charge of the music dept over there should be fired."
121,"Why would folks like Jessica, John Malkovich and Colin Farrel even sign up for such straight up non sense? Did they not read the script?No story line, pointless deaths and fights, weird and acerbic conversations, convoluted twists...I could go on and on and on. Geena Davis's was the only believable character in this entire farce of a movie.Wish I could 90 minutes of my life back! Even in the quarantine....."
122,"It's the same old style of female spy movie,beautiful woman with surprisingly fighting skill & some life problem but I'm quite enjoy this.
Just one thing, why that Colin Farrell who act like he's a master die so fast?"
123,"Editor keeps using digital zooms almost in every shot which cheapens a film that looks like it was shot in a few days time (mostly indoors). I am surprised Jessica Chastain signed on for this. What a weak movie, not even B-movie... it's a Shhhh-movie. Horrible! What a waste of time."
124,"From the bizarre soundtrack to the strange storyline, I have no idea what the hell I just watched. Nothing made sense. There was no point to half the random storyline's going. Just odd. Don't waste your time."
125,Nothing special. Same old storyline. Characters line are flat. Every scene is boring. I don't thinks anyone made a jokes in this movies.
126,"Production, plot and sometimes acting all seem cheap. I love Chastain but NO, this did NOT work."
127,"It's just a shalow hitwoman story.
Lot's of unnecessary and unrealistic killings mixed with zero story.
No reason whatsoever for the charecters to bond or hate each other.
Seems to be written by a tennnager."
128,Great action film.... did not like the ending so much
129,Possibly the worst film I've ever watched.A strong cast with many excellent films to their credit. What on earth possessed them to even consider this awful film?
130,A nice action movie with a family backgroud history. Good enough for a lazy day and way better than others of the same genre. Jessica Chastain is pretty here. An enjoyable piece of cinema.
131,"Very shallow by the numbers tale. I couldn't connect with the characters in any way. The story lacked depth, it has some decent action scenes but overall a missed opportunity to make a decent female led action movie."
132,"Everything needed to know about Ava was in the intro of the movie. The rest of the movie was an illustration of what her files said she was in the intro. So if you haven't watched this yet, make sure you take your time to read her info in the intro before proceeding to the main story or else you will end up not enjoying the movie. To me it felt like the female version of John Wick."
133,"It was a fine movie but very predictable, also I would change the end like this:The fight with Simon in the Hotel Room ends there, no need of the walking... After that she talk with the sister, some meanful words, she explain all about the money that she is going to give to the family and she goes away, later some hitman try to kill her with no success and when she is trying to scape in some moment get trapped and killed by Camille (Simons daugther), and then repeat again the greek quote that Duke said. The End."
134,"Yes, the premise has been done before, as have plenty of horror stories and others, it's the execution, direction, etc that make some stand out over others...some of these ""reviewers"" who ripped this movie, if you can say you didn't like ""Hanna"", or the Korea movie ""The Witch"", should have their movie card pulled immediately. This wasn't the best but damn sure wasn't the worst, Chastain is at the forefront....sad little people all boo-hoo about the pandemic just waiting to smash on anything....IMDB should institute a way to read the reviews for every person on all movies, to give you a good idea on whether or not to ignore it immediately lol. There's not much else out there to watch these days, this is def watchable, not a 5, def not a 10, but somewhere in between and again, worth the time."
135,"Wow I'm so glad I didn't listen till the negative Nellys in the comment section because what an earth are they expecting? Citizen Kane?
This was just as good as every other assassin action film that I've seen only better because it had a really good cast and it was led by a kick ass woman in Jessica Chastain who was as good as she always is.
Some fun action pieces, a bit more backstory than expected which I enjoyed, and the violence was brutal and realistic which I really dug.
No idea what people's problems are with this film
6.5/10"
136,I really liked this movie. The story had a good tempo. Not too difficult. Easy to follow. Very nice fight/action scenes. Go watch it...
137,Great action scenes spoilt by a overly dramatic home life story and secondary characters. Where have all the good writers gone?????
138,"Well I see IMDB still has a troll problem but this was such a great thriller I felt compelled to say something. Jessica Chastain, John Malkovich and Colin Farrell were all at the top of their game. Thoroughly entertaining. If you like spy thrillers SEE this film. If you have even a scintilla of appreciation for true acting craft SEE this film."
139,"I wonder how many bad reviews and most of people don't like it,
ok let us say it's not ""John wick"" in action but still acceptable action movie. Jessica made great effort in many action scenes. also story line is not that bad.
you want every action movie either become john wick or the movie become bad, thinking like kids...."
140,Why the hate ? Only 5.3 ??? Her acting was great. And my review is too short ? Who care !
141,"Wow what a disappointing mess this one was. Just goes to show that even one of the best in the business, Jessica Chastain (who is in practically every scene), can get burned by a poor script and bad direction.Indeed, even a stellar supporting cast including Colin Farrell, John Malkovich, Geena Davis and Joan Chen can't save this pointless, disjointed action flick from heading straight into the bargain bin it belongs in at Walmart (or Amazon).The 'story' is all over the place, with way too many superfluous side plots like the needless mom and daughter/s angst, ex-bf angst, killing ethics angst, gambling debt angst... yeah, you get the idea, adding nothing but run time and groans to the proceedings.*Spoiler** Such a senseless waste of talent. Case in point... why on Earth does Farrell's character just show up at a hotel looking to kill 'Ava', then ludicrously walk away after a bloodsoaked stalemate and end up getting shot by our anti-heroine walking away down the street nervously looking over his shoulder. Ludicrous.Mind you, you have to admire co-producer Chastain's optimism... Ava actually sets itself up for a sequel. Cannot see that happening after this stunning waste of the casts talent and our time. Oh well, back to old 007 films yet again."
142,"Why do screenwriters treat people like idiots last couple of years? Why no one takes time to write a good script and why are they putting so much money in production, action scenes and actors when the plot itself is not worth it?If you need to clean your house or something like that or need to chill without paying much attention to movie then I it is just ok to watch.."
143,"Is ""Ava"" yet another tiresome plug for US exceptionalism? In my opinion it would be easy to reach that conclusion.A cold, trained killer, who bumps off people around the globe, the US state does not like. Ava comes to question what she does but her response, is stick to the sanctioned serial killer script. Finally deviating, only when her handler and her own life, is threatened.Its hardly an endearing proposition. Made worse, by a rather predictable and trite back story, that goes nowhere interesting.Its unfortunate too, as the cast hand in reasonable performances and the action is alright, if nothing we have not seen a thousand times before.5/10."
144,"I think this movie is very good, the family part is very touching, and the performance of the actors is also good."
145,"Just a waste of time and very boring, another stupid action movie without a plot. I gave it a rate of 2, just because I like John Malkovich, otherwise it would have been 1."
146,"I didn't like the direction,incoherent,suddenly lost the narrative and gets into a tv soap familiar drama,then it goes back to non sense killing.
I didn't¬¥t like the fight scenes.Sometimes they look fake and overdone.
I didn't like the music score.
I liked the cast but not the movie.
I believe all this happens because Chastain produces the film too."
147,"Much better than reviewed, this movie appears to suffer from severe critic-itis, where familiarity breeds contempt for narrative and entertainment value.
I notice jaded, negative reviews from men, women and user-reviewers. The movie I saw had great humanity and said a lot about individuality. This is NOT a Michael Bay movie of cardboard cutouts. Other reviews complain of ""soap opera"" writing. I disagree. Every development of supporting characters bears on main character's development and arc. If soap operas were written this well, I'd be watching them.This is basically Atomic Blonde 2.0. Jessica Chastain watches Charlize Theron produce and star in Atomic Blonde. She says, ""I could do this; and maybe, do it better.""I suspect the bad-ass female Bond-spy-assasain--done with any integrity--starts with Luc Besson's La Femme Nikita (1990), perhaps the most likely pop-culture origin of the Marvel movies Black Widow. Then we have Hanna (2011) and Atomic Blonde (2017) among a few others.Ava (2020) is in this line. It betters Atomic Blonde in its character development and sequel set-up. It falls short of Atomic Blonde in fight chereography. Jessica generously gives the best lines and good scenes to her supporting cast--not often done. Geena Davis has the most surprising character arc of the film.Jessica chose her scritpwriter with care, All Matthew Newton's scripts are about real people with real emotions--not Michael Bay cardboard cutouts. Ava is about people also, bettering Atomic blonde on this count also. Colin Farrel and John Malkovich are at their best, not phoning in their performances.Jessica is still beautiful to watch. Her final makeup, probably chosen from a dozen, sketches is very striking. The end allows Jessica an interesting feminine twist on Terminator unlike anything in recent memory and nothing like Cameron's female terminators. Nicely done I say. Good narrative set-up for a sequel."
148,"Good acting all round from an impressive cast, featuring a flawed assassin with an actual living family (for once!), coupled with brilliantly choreographed fight sequences make this a fiercely entertaining, if highly implausible, addition to the action movie genre. Recommended"
149,"How could one feel anything but contempt for a ""hero"" that runs around killing innocent people for no reason at all. This film is plain garbage."
150,"I cant believe Jessica would do a film like this, since she is the producer as well, I guess she was trying to take a role which is so hardcore, bad ass and cool , but it just didnt work, not even close. It is too bad for this film that we are in 2020 now, cos everyone can just skip a movie whenever they want to, and i decided to stop this one on the 2nd fight scene, thats about 24 mins.. If u want to watch cool fight scene+female spy that sort of things, check Anna or Hana or Red sparrow or even What happened to Monday first, in terms of plots and action and everything are just way too better than Ava. 3 stars for jessica, colin and john, 1 for action and none for the script."
151,"Some action scenes could throw you out from your chair, some are boring and not properly intact. 'Ava' has the mixture of family drama, secret agent stuffs, killing and a lost love. There are a bit of lessons worthy to be keep in mind that are portrayed all throughout the film."
152,"Don't listen to the american brats that wouldn't even be happy if they were given 1 million dollar for free... they always complaint no matter what.The movie is actually quite good, and I recommend you give it a go...
Main actress is really good in this one, and the story was quite original actually..."
153,"Story is usual, not new but packed script and good back ground score bind you till the end this thriller. Story of an assassin, Ava who works for an organization, is an perfect killer having some family matters of her sister, mother and her ex-fiancee now became her sister's. After some circumstances organization want to kill Ava, and what is next and end? You have to watch this good thriller. Some kickass fights really enjoyable. No boring path round the movie, it entertains you till end and yes, end is open and might have a sequel too. Overall watchable once. Rating of 5 is not justified for this it should have 6 and more."
154,Seen this formula done so many times before. This was watchable once...the end..
155,"This film is classic. My mother recommended I watch and when I asked why, her response was 'girl power'.I like that Ava killed the antagonist. She showed no remorse which was unpredictable. I thought she would let him live.The ending narration was great as well as the daughter of the antagonist."
156,"The reason I turned it off is because I thought it would be a high octane thriller, but it's half assassin story half whiney family story about a recovering alcoholic? So it descends into melodrama when you want action, which leaves you disappointed and going on to the next film."
157,"When you see those big names, and some of them have Oscar nominations, you expect something out of them. Not better things, but you know what I mean, something. But this writing is so moronic that you question your own sanity for picking it out of the streaming line choices and also wonder if all those seemingly capable stars have actually read the script? This writing? And they still willingly choose to do it? No, it can't be. They must be under some kind of siege... maybe they are the ones who are being hunted by those assassins, Not Ava."
158,"Bad acting. Bad plot. (i.e. the same type of super-female we've seen 10,000 times)Avoid at all costs."
159,"Ouch! A perfect waste of 90 minutes.
A barely existent plot, consisting of a few violent episodes, held together with cobwebs, cliches, and mildew. There's zero character development, which is a tragic waste of some very talented actors. The script is lame, and the cinematography, like the rest of the components, creaks through the gears in a totally perfunctory fashion, with zero absorption. Even the action sequences are dull. By halfway, I was fairly certain that it had been directed by an algorithm. Fat paychecks all round, but thin gruel for the viewer.If you ever want to show someone how not to make an action movie, give them a copy of Ava."
160,This was basic garbage and I can't believe Jessica agreed to star in it. Don't these actors think before taking on roles these days.
161,"When i noticed the cast ensemble here, I was ready for something a bit more intense and structured. And with those exceptions at hand, it plays the opposite of that.The films hits as it was rushed, as the actors could not work long on their scenes, and the action scenes where limited by budget and time constraints.
The editing also sometimes hurts, as some of the action scenes are messy and even normal conversations are thrown off by stressed cuts.There is so much room here for something amazing, a female jason bourne with a proper story and in-depth personality is probably some of the goals. But it plays of as one mixed the dish together a bit to fast, like someone kept telling them to hurry.
Also there is a suspected unbalance of the budget, as it is used on all of its major actors present. And then the unbalance pushes the remaining film schedule into a stressful venture.Everyone in their leads play their scenes as good as they can, the support cast is not weak, they just lack a depth, the action scenes work sometimes but then fails on their next interconnected scene, when it just looks bad. Its like a roller coaster, fun sometimes, but way to long going upwards and then rushed into a short speedy downhill."
162,"Great acting, very good fight scenes, well chosen soundtrack, boring seen-it-a-dozen-times plot. As for such group of well praised actors I expected a more solid story. Good enough to watch after work hours and not regret it."
163,"As always Collin is Bad, super bad as always. If he wasn't in this movie, at least worth watching but he ruined yet another movie with his weak acting.
Watch the version without Collin in it, that may worth your time."
164,"This movie could have been so so much better. It had the right actors(Jessica Chastain, John Malkovich, Colin Farrell & Geena Davis), had some interesting hand-to-hand fight scenes and though cliched still effective emotionally flawed protagonist.But three really really big mistakes by the director/writer kept this move from being a highly rated action thriller.1. Way too much unnecessary melodrama. Her backstory was complicated enough but they add an additional complication which has no purpose in the film just to cast a well known actor. Several times the film came to a halt when this 'extra complication' was on the screen.2. Protagonist makes three decisions that an ordinary dumbest criminal would not make. It is so obviously badly written scenes that it makes movie almost laughable. This is a highly-trained international assassin that been able to be cloak and dagger for many years, please do the character justice and not have them so something on the intelligence level of a 14yr old junkie. Yes, the decisions are that bad.3. Motivation: I have very little reason why anyone is doing anything as there is not enough character backstory to make you care. You cannot appreciate or understand how things are if you never knew how they were. Characters appear, given a name and proceed with an action that you are unable to invest in.While this sounds bad, the acting(Chastain, Malkovich and especially Geena Davis) saves the moves and makes it somewhat watchable...for me. The 1 or 2 star reviews are just people being negative, this movie ranges between 4 star to 7 star depending on personality."
165,"I guess there aren't many great actors who don't also do action movies anymore. Some of them are pretty good at it. Jessica Chastain had already played the baddie in one of the X-Men burgers, ""Dark Phoenix"" (2019), and here she is in one of those double-crossed hired-gun things, ""Ava."" Lot of choppy cutting around punches and kicks and stuff. As strong as the 5'4"" or so Chastain surely is, I started to have my doubts re in-the-realm-of-remotely-possible after she arm flipped the half-dozenth guy over in hand-to-hand combat. I don't know--I'd need to see her with a friend who turns into a giant green CGI Mr. Hyde every time he gets angry for me to fully suspend my disbelief on that one. But, if I'm not going to complain about her slipping around bullets in a floor-long dress, I should probably drop the matter.Lot of tough talk and dead stares in this one, too. Despite her character in this one getting into trouble for being too chatty, I'm thinking Chastain is the female equivalent of Ryan Gosling. The camera seems to love hanging on their silent, almost expressionless faces. ""The Tree of Life,"" ""Drive"" (both 2011), Zero Dark Thirty"" (2012), ""Blade Runner 2049"" (2017). They seem like chill, quiet folks to me for being occasional action stars whose characters kill people. By the way, an internet search of the female equivalent of Gosling, as does Chastain and Gosling, turns up more than I would've thought.Come to think of it, big stars have long done blockbuster-type roles for paychecks, but it seems as though it used to be more so in supporting roles, to lend some prestige to such flicks. Think Marlon Brando in ""Superman"" (1978), say, or Helen Mirren in a ""Fast & Furious"" installment. Here, there's also John Malkovich, Geena Davis and, to remind everyone of a better similar movie (""In Bruges"" (2006)), Colin Farrell. Anyways, I mention all of this because there's not much to say about ""Ava;"" it's utterly forgettable.There's some melodrama regarding her alcoholism and a love triangle involving her sister's boyfriend, who also has a gambling problem. Oh, and the mom has obsessive-compulsive disorder, so, I guess that checks off the list of simple traits passed off as characters. One shouldn't expect more from a title and protagonist named ""Ava"" as a more complex form of ""Eve,"" who works for an organization referred to as ""Management,"" though. Chastain's character is contracted to murder 41 people--and she kills even more than that in the process--for reasons unknown, and it's not until she tries to steal her sister's boyfriend that she realizes she's a bad person. It doesn't take that long, however, to figure out this is a bad movie."
166,"I had low expectations going into this film, and in the first few minutes I knew I was right. People from AR don't sound that way, they certainly know firing a gun in a car makes EVERYONE deaf and Jessica Chastain as an action star is about as dumb as Common as a leading man. Let alone the belief that 3 white women from MA all have this affinity for a large black man.
The pointless attempts to establish this backstory of Ava as an alcoholic/drug addict is just completely pointless. The only piece missing from this train wreck is they needed Michael Bay to direct.
The other reviews are right, the plot is contrite and although the action sequences are mildly entertaining, they cannot carry an entire movie.
The basic plot being that the recovering addict assassin is marked for death by her own people (Colin Ferrell with a porn-stach), basically because of her own existential crisis.
At least when CF was being hunted by his own people, he had the sense to hide In Bruges and make it entertaining.
Chastain is just a knock off bryce Dallas Howard with a vegan attitude who should NOT be trying to play action hero."
167,Have you tried to watch any of the many scenes of her TRYING to run?
168,"Great cast, I hoped the other negative reviews were not accurate. Alas, they are. Boring, poor writing, some weak acting. Just skip. Save yourself"
169,"The cast was promising - Jessica Chastain has been forging a career built on great characters who pass the Bechdel test and are not just a backdrop for the male protagonist. Unfortunately, as another reviewer pointed out, this was clearly a Hollywood friends trying to do a thing together situation and it just didn't work.Common as Michael is awful. Geena Davis, who has fought for women in Hollywood, has to utter a sentence 'I chose your father over you because I was afraid of being alone'. Jessica Chastain played a scene where she threw herself at her sister's fianc√© and asked him to run away with her. Diana Silvers has maybe 5 sentences in the whole flick. There's so much talent in this movie and they've wasted it on complete cliche of a copy + paste script with poor direction. And of course we know there will be a sequel due to the hint at the end."
170,This movie is getting slated by most people...its an ok movie.could have been made better (remove Michael for a start)....in a time where not many films are being released this was quite enjoyable to watch
171,"Deployable movie with famous actors but terrible ultra-violence !
Jessica has lost her face, figure and skills in any regard."
172,"Bad studio backdrops, terrible fight scene co-ordination, bad sound editing where will it end.Sure the big names regret this one."
173,"Jessica Chastain I love you, you're an awesome actress, but this movie is pure garbage."
174,Reasonable movie completely ruined by the poor sound the director should never work again to allow this sound on his movie
175,"Lots of action, random eruption of fights, plot doesn't flow and don't expect too much intelligence in the movie though the story has some secret organization that does covert ops. For some reasons their wanton destruction has no one caring, no cops, no fbi etc. Could have used a lot more foreign assassin escapades ~ trains, airports, car chase, explosions, before complicating AVAs life with personal issues that turn this from action thriller to drama."
176,"Real average movie. Nothing noticeably terrible, but it feels like a watered down version of other action movies. The directors could have definitely made the bad guys better at their job though. Our main character manages to tie the fight at the end while drunk and injured, which is ridiculous even for movie logic.Minor detail that bothered me: at the start Ava puts the phone on the hood of the car, then when she enters the car and the camera pans out, it is gone."
177,"Dang, this is so violent! I mean I watch gore movies now and then but this one is just violent. I don't wanna watch a beautiful woman getting bloody beaten and then wins because she is scripted to win. There is no thrill, no glory, no story development, it was shallow overall. But there are two things this movie has. One, a little drama. This one scene in particular. Two, female beauty. Actress shows off her nice body with clothes that emphasizes her body line. I think I watched til the end because of the second one. Hahahahaha"
178,The acting is not bad but the characters lines and stories are weak.I was surprised to see how deep the casting roster went.Individually i like everyone in the cast but they didn't mix well together in this movie.A lot of the scenes in this movie didn't need to happen and were irrelevant to the story or plot.The fight scenes are excellent but few and far between.For a spy/assassin movie i would have liked to see more espionage and more action.Jessica Chastain played her role very well and was the best part of the movie. 5/10 from me
179,"This story was done so much better in 2011 with Gina Carano in
""Haywire"" & without all the OTT BS of illegal gambling & dodgy nightclubs & a dysfunctional family, seriously who greenlights garbage writing like this."
180,"A great acting line up but their delivery was astoundingly boring. Even the fight scenes were lacking. Not worth much to watch unless you need to fill in 90 odd minutes, and only if you can download it free. Disappointed"
181,"The question that this film makes you ask is how so many big name actors can still make such a poor film.
So the plot is cliche: beautiful woman with a troubled history becomes an assassin with a conscience. But the whole film just looks like everyone is going through the motions. Even the action scenes look half hearted. Nothing is convincing. There is no character depth. You are generally left without caring about the characters or even whether you watch the rest of film."
182,"A really good film for what it is, very john wick-esque. Builds on some interesting pillars of assassins mythology. Would recommend!"
183,"There's very little in Ava that makes us care for Chastain's titular character or her inner turmoils. Her past is said to be an unpleasant one but for a movie about an assassin, that's typical. The edits were all over the place, with many scenes feeling disjointed. A good chunk of the first hour is just Ava going through the motions - she conducts hits in different countries, her tendency to question the morals of her cases is highlighted, she goes for jogs, checks in to hotels, and takes messages from her superior Duke (John Malkovich, who has no business being in a movie like this, except for the paycheck). Nothing really sparks interest.And with the movie's progression, I wondered if it was this easy for Ava to switch between a stone-cold assassin and someone who wants to reconnect with her family; one that she left many years ago because of her heartless father. The whole thing feels tailor-made for viewers who seek quick resolutions and instant gratification in their films.
The set-pieces aren't bad but nothing too great - the Riyadh one being the worst of the lot. What did surprise me was the short but all-out brawl between 66-year-old Malkovich and a suave-looking Colin Farrell.The film's connective tissue is supposed to be the father-daughter vibe shared between Ava and Duke but it doesn't hit the highs you expect. Part of the blame goes to the sloppy dialogues (the screenplay is by writer-actor Matthew Newton). The biggest problem with Ava is not that it's generic (Chastain is just having fun here), but the fact that we've seen this assassin-taking-revenge plot handled better in other films ('Salt', or even 'Colombiana'). We know how it'll all play out, we know who's getting written off.Farrell looks good but the characterization is so dull that you don't want to know more about him, or his daughter Camille (played by Diana Silvers). The pairing of rapper Common and Chastain doesn't work. The chemistry between the two is practically non-existent. When Ava refers to her mother as 'Ma' and not 'Mum', it felt like a subtle nod to the director Tate Taylor's previous film. I wouldn't recommend this film even to action film buffs; in fact, I'd advise them to keep expectations low."
184,"I don't watste any second on the movie, bad acting, bad music and the story Line is written by 8 year olds"
185,"A somewhat predictable plot, but this is an action movie so I wasn't expecting much in that department. The only redeeming feature in the movie is Jessica Chastain, hence why I don't give it one star. Common is absolutely terrible, as in every single movie I see him in; no idea who keeps thinking he can act - a wooden plank would probably do a better job. And the story line for his character is boring and completely expendable. Jessica Chastain is one of my absolute favourite actresses and it hurts to see her in such a movie, because she deserves so much better."
186,"Really good one .pace rhythm sustained throughout.redolent of Nikita (1990) or more distantly Colombiana (2011) .... so Besson-adjacent not as good but ...i do not understand the neg reviews .believable main actress .never seen her before.Geena Davis is a Goddess actress.The mother daughter talk is AWESOME best bit.Farrell ace.Malkovich the man with the most annoying voice in the known universe is very good here.Scene out of Le Bourget Airport farcical for anyone who has been to Paris even once; no they do not have tall American fir forests between Le Bourget and Paris but hey.Rhythm Beat is everything.This film has it.Female assassins genre still rocks.PS: Common looks like a young Richie Havens you expect ""Freedom"" any minute"
187,"Clich√©-ridden film. Takes 40 minutes before any actual dramatic tension is introduced, and even that is without mystery because the film telecasts who the good guys and bad guys are. By the way, that first 40 minutes includes some painfully bad family drama subplot. I mean, soap-opera level stuff."
188,"Jessica Chastain proves once again that she's not a lead and she can't carry a film. Even when she hand picks every single aspect of the movie, from who's pointing the camera to all the casting decisions she still fails.Perhaps movies should be made to entertain, not check boxes."
189,"Or bad story, nothing enjoyablefighting scenes are very bad, nothing is realisticwaste of time"
190,"Thanks Jessica for wasting my time. This is the worst 'action' movie I have ever seen. That introduction of 'multi-ethnic' or 'multi-cultural' characters was baseless and didn't even fit anywhere in th storyline. If the idea was being 'inclusive', where are the LGBTQ characters?. Such a horrendous effort to produce an american action movie. Don't bother."
191,"Is Hollywood running out of ideas and why is common in this film ?First of the movie is too predictable long and drawn out with stupid plots ,i was on my phone and between sleep and wake and never had to rewind the movie because I knew I wouldn't miss anything important.I am disappointed because when I saw the 3 actors I thought this was going to be 100 but realized it was100% pure garbage and common was the garbage container."
192,"We all know, it's a matter of taste, after all. And thrillers with depth are just my personal favourite.
The character Ava gives us something new, somethnig we haven't seen before. While we have seen hundrets of one-person killing machines, this one has a real, realistic and understandable history. And not only a history, she has got a present, which means: real issues besides her current job. The viewer gets to know her problems and issues up close. The scenes and dialogues with her sister, her mother, her ex fianc√© are atmospherically dense and paint a really three-dimensionl picture of the main character and her social relations.
Honorable mention: Who knew that Geena Davis could act like that!!??
For me, the best one-person killer movie since 'Leon: The professional', and nearly as good. Very similarly to Luc Besson's hitman Leon, in Ava, we get to know the hitwoman as a torn person struggling to get whole again.
An unexpected masterpiece!"
193,"Bad script, poor acting, and horrible editing. Total waste of time watching, it should be zero star!"
194,"What a harsh movie, scenarists, directors and producers had it gone all wrong :(("
195,There were less than five minutes of the film in which Jessica Chastain's acting was almost believable. The rest was pretty painful to watch.Literally every scene has been done in another movie. I'm embarrased for John Malkovich and Colin Ferrel for participating in this.
196,A nonsense and unrealistic movie ever seen on secret agent field. The story and the acting could be better than this.
197,"Awful, could've been great... but it just wasn't.All those incredible actors, what was the director thinking?!"
198,It goes nowhere but not fast. Plotless and pointless. What were they thinking?
199,"The first scene of the movie is just dumb, she wants to kill a business man so she sits at the backseat of the car with him close range and shoots her weapon in a closed vehicle and (i guess her ears are made out of titanium).why not just finish him off when your outside of the car and minimize risks that he might get the better of you?For a super skilled assassin that killed dozens of people it just doesn't resonate authenticity..
She does acrobatic maneuvers and Jessica clearly isn't fit in the movie, she should have taken a few months of training before filming like male actors do to make her role credible."
200,Jessica chastian is great and as always John malkovich is a dream the problem is the below par script if you want to watch a really good female driven assassin film watch haywire or point of no return aka the assassin
201,"Jessica Chastain is my favourite actress. She always delivers a solid performance in every film she has been in, even the dreadful X-Men film. I loved her fight skills in The Debt when she was sparring using Krav Maga. The fight scenes in this film were unimaginative. There was no excitement at all. Atomic Blonde and Anna had some incredible hand to hand combat scenes but this film was a let down. Why on earth Common appeared in it is a mystery as he is a terrible actor. He is so wooden he should have splinters. I tried to like it. It had potential but it had no Ooomph!"
202,"Nonchalant script and dialogues. Chastain looks totally out of place in action sequences, even in jogging scenes. Stunt choreography at times too lose that you can see the fakeness."
203,"Great actors terrible performances, bad story e the worst dialogues!"
204,"This movie might be the 1000th movie trying to be Nikita or the female John Wick.Obviously, we have the usual stupid stuff, like a 5.3 ft skinny woman able to tank multiple punches from muscular soldiers. But of course, when she punches back, it's instant KO. Ridiculous...What made this movie worse than the other Nikita ripoffs is the absence of... everything. No style, even less substance. At least, other movies tried to look cool (Atomic blonde, Peppermint, Red sparrow, Maria...). But Ava has no plot, no charisma, no fun... nothing. 1h30 of pure boredom."
205,"Wanna see some good actors in their worst acting scenes ?
Watch Ava !
The scenario fits in two short sentences. Everything is predictable.
The realisation is terrible. The picture was shot by a stinky teenager.
A bad bad bad movie."
206,I disliked everyone in this film. I didn't care about them; or what happened to them. I only watched the whole movie because I rented it.
207,Plot: none here. movie score: the worst. actors: non convincing. Don't waste your time on this one.
208,"Ahhh... apparently US actors can't google stories about Australian writer / directors to see whether they have a problematic history of violence. Surprise surprise! Better make him step down as director. Unfortunately they were too late to get somebody who could write an interesting plot, characters or dialogue."
209,For such a crew of actors the acting was horrible. They didn't even try. Just cashed their paychecks.
210,"Who are these people actually working for?the 2 main people in the management are dead( duke and simon)
So who's still in the company?
Ava waltzes around the world killing people and also her home town of Boston but not once has the police put out any resources to catch this killer who doesn't even hide her identity, Michael is so boring he could cure insomnia and the Simon character is also poor he's a trained killer but he goes to her hotel and despite trying to kill Ava he walks away and walk he does,he doesnt just call an Uber he literally sets off walking home...
The alcohol part in the hotel where she finally drinks some has the sound effects of it giving her super powers yet it actually does nothing to alter the story so why bother putting it in?
Oh Ava by the way despite brexit the UK is still a European country....
If you want a poorly acted film with bad fight scenes and a story that's so paper thin its almost not there then watch this but if you want a decent film in this genre then rewatch the Bourne films 100% better than this drivel....."
211,"Great artists, but who ever wrote the script should be nutured and forced to write the Twitter messages for Trump in his retirement."
212,"The film was shot badly, there really are no action scenes and when they appear, they are just awful, it was very difficult to watch as the action scenes were edited very clumsily and incomprehensibly. I don't understand how cool actors like Jessica Chastain, Colin Farrell and John Malkovich could have starred in such a stupid and banal film. I can't praise them, and I can't scold them, they were ... they just were. The main character is very incomprehensible, I do not want to empathize with her at all, the minor characters are also very poorly spelled out their motivation is stupid. The only thing I liked was the soundtrack, it was good, but otherwise the film is bad. The director tried to make a drama / action movie about a hired killer showing how poor and unhappy she is so that we would feel sorry for her and empathize with her, but she does not show from the good side, and therefore it is simply unrealistic."
213,"Script is boring, action choreography is horrible, and everything is so predictable that I was surprised to not find Dolph Lundgren on a cast."
214,"I like action movies. I really like ""Leon"" with the unique Natalie Portman and the unruffled Jean Reno. I love ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" and all the Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie family issues. There are many more action movies I like, but ""Ava"" will never make this list.P.S. Jessica Chastain is a wonderful actress and a very stylish and beautiful woman."
215,"The story is so weak, like it leads us to no where, just lost, as lost as the direction. I like Chastain and Farrel, but this movie is a waste."
216,"A redheaded John Wick with alcohol Problems and Mental issues meets soap opera and bad acting.My biggest pet peeve was with the alcoholism in the movie. It had no place in there and was completely pointless. The fighting scenes were pretty solid though, which made me feel that it was still worth watching."
217,Every line of dialogue is physically painful. Every clich√© lined up for an hour and thirty minutes.
218,"Geena Davis moments are pure gold.
The cast is perfect, but the plot and story are lame, and the director work is terrible, so cast can't save the movie.
Jessica can hold an action thriller, that's for sure, but the Coriography of the bare hands fights together with poor directing skill results with artificial scenes, you can even feel when the director cuts a scene or when he says action.
The family plot of the movie could have been removed to make space for more action plot. Ava could, theoretically, have a equal but it won't, it's not good enough. If you just want to kill 1.5 hours then watch it, you will forget it shortly after finished."
219,"It was ok , its something to watch if you have nothing better to do"
220,"Only in Hollywood folks; so a 43 year old 5'2"" 110 pound woman is going to take out dozens of full grown men that are trained soldiers ?!?!? I don't bloody think so, no matter how well she was trained. The writing is weak & this type of storyline has been done way to much ! Please stop the madness Hollywood and give us something original and believable."
221,"Not only the story is a clich√©, it's also completely illogical, some elements are so dumb I had to wash my eyes, and my soul still ached. Some stars in my rating for cinematography and general feel without taking plot into account, but overall verdict is:don't bother watching this."
222,"Popular actors with zero chemistry and this movie has so many mistakes and a terrible story.
More drama than action and after a while it gets old.The lead actress is not at all believable as an assassin. The way she holds/fires a gun is bad. All fight scenes are close ups with multiple quick cuts.
She can't run or fight and there are much better actresses to play this character who are already in shape and would have trained for the role.
Bottom line is that she never stepped foot in a martial arts studio and it shows badly."
223,"Just wish the unbelivable female ""assassin"" had crashed her car while lighting a cigarette in the first few seconds of this pointless drivel to save me wasting my time watching the rest of this film to see if it could get any better. I was wrong. It got worse."
224,"I wrote a review recently of ""The Last Days of American Crime"" in which I stated it was quite possibly the worst film I had ever seen. Well, I can now safely say that ""Ava"" makes that piece of absolute rubbish look like a cinematic masterpiece. You would think a film with great actors like Jessica Chastain, John Malkovich and Collin Farrel couldn't fail, on how wrong you would be. What you get is another run of the mill story about an assassin, except this time there is literally no story. Nothing in the film makes sense, the dialogue is nonsensical, the actors are just phoning their performances in and the fight scenes, are well just poor. There isn't a single redeeming thing to say about this film.......... avoid at all costs"
225,"Bad acting. Dumb, reused story. How many times do we see the Le Femme Nikita movie with the female unstoppable heroine?Boring as hell. Avoid at all costs."
226,"A classic American movie (as my grandfather says, ""American Lemonade""), which has already been seen on the movie screen, which is close to the average, badly changing the frames of the movie, which makes it boring to watch."
227,"Seriously bad movie. Story makes no sense, character narratives and plot changes throughout, action is like watching an amateur homemade movie.
Save your time and skip it!"
228,"Is it possible to waste money doing movies like this? Despite it is always the same stories, the same backgrounds, the same epilogues, the same events... there isn't neither the effort to introduce something new or to develop the conflicts of the protagonist to create a deep empathy with her. There a lot of triviality in this movie, very superficial scratches of the characters that make impossible for the viewer to feel anything watching this. Perhaps the worst thing to me is the attempt to give some profound meaning to Ava doubts on her killings, talking with her subjects to understand why they have to die, and then she completely forget these doubts and kill a lot of people without any problems. All the ones of the military police for examples, men that are only working for a general, with their families at home. The pointless shooting at the game room another. It seems that this movie is for ignorant spectators: give them a bit of ""something that seems profound"", a bit of ""pure stupid action with deaths and guns and punches"", a bit of family problems, add also a bit of a social and psychological problem like the alcoholism, mix all together even without a real logic and the people will love the movie. Well, I'm sorry but I didn't love the movie and it made me angry about its nothingness."
229,"So the good is that there are a handful of decent action scenes - not John Wick decent, but acceptable.The bad is that the dialog is terrible, the acting (especially Common - who told that idiot he could act???) was stilted and literally unbelievable (not in a good way) and the plot was stupid beyond belief. Who cares if an international assassin is curious about why? If she still gets the job done, what does it matter? And yet this is the central point of the story. And we are supposed to believe she is a reformed junkie? And the utterly stupid dynamics with her family? Children write more plausible plots than this.Save your time/money and skip this trash."
230,Most idiotic movie.jessica is godd as a actress but not director .skip this one
231,"What Jessica Chastain, John Malkovich, and Collin Farrel doing in this movie? And beautiful Geena Davis is too young to play sick mother."
232,"Almost everything about the movie is bad.Let's start with the writing. There isn't really much of a plot to speak of. None of the characters seem particularly three dimensional. Was this written by an AI that doesn't understand emotions and how people actually speak to each other?We've a leading female character who doesn't seem particularly strong but she can single handedly take out a small well trained bunch of guys by hand or by gun.The editing is poor as well. The audio isn't always in sync from one cut to another, the director seems to think he can use digital zoom (cropping) and nobody will notice how blurry the resulting image will look. Well, we do notice these things.I didn't give a toss about what happened to any of the characters, and in a week I won't even be able to remember what happened in the movie.Go watch a Neil Breen movie instead. At least they're so bad they're funny. This movie didn't have any soul at all and it shows.I guess that's what you get when you have a writer with the track record of Matthew Newton."
233,"Jessica Chastain should not be the lead role in this, or any movie for that matter, as a matter of fact she should only play extras that are victims that die at the beginning of movies, that is the extent of her talent.... I couldn't even get through the trailer of this crap. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this because I would have demanded my money back immediately!!"
234,"Originally writer, director was fired for to past legal (domestic violence) problems. The director brought in to replace him, Tate Taylor, is the director from ""The Help."" A good director but not really known for his action films, lol. Then the movie studio decided to change the name of the film AND the title character from ""Eve"" to ""Ava"" which resulted in a lot of re-shoots, dubs and cuts. Kind of a mess.
BUT the three lead actors here, Chastain, Malkovich and Farrell, could basically stand around reading the back of a cereal box and it would be a dramatic and entertaining evening. AND IT IS!!
Don't pay to much attention to the plot or the mechanics and you'll be just fine.
With Geena Davis, Common and Joan Chen throw in for good measure because, yeah, why not."
235,"The plot moves like a snail, but the action sequences aren't that bad and while the story isn't that great, at least their is something to distract you from the crummy plot."
236,"Worst film, and script I've ever listened to and watched. The 2 combined, result in an abomination of cinema. How professional people from within the 2 fields believed that either match the other or either was worthy of release baffles me. It's so awful it's either the worst film ever created, or the worst comedy ever written???"
237,"It is even more disappointing when good actors like Jessica Chestain and Colin Farrell are in this whatsoever movie. So many plot holes and pointless fight. She left the bullet hole on the car window and drives all the way back? No prob. Why is there is a fire alarm in the hotel? No explanation. Why she needs to be alcoholic? No answer. Why does she need to make a fuss to pay the debt? bc she likes it? btw, Ava looks more like a retired agent who has serious depression, she can be everything but a pro."
238,Wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this trash.Wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this trash.Wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this trash.
239,The movie is the versi√≥n bored and female of John Wick
240,This movie is beyond terrible! The plot does not make sense at all and the little love triangle between the sisters is quite disturbing. Not what I expected at all. They could've kept this in the drafts.
241,"I agree with the low stars ,& commentary. What are all these great actors doing in this extremely mediocre film? Story is boring, the fight scenes are REALLY boring, & yhe mobie is disappointing. Don't waste your time on this film."
242,Probably the worst movie i've seen in years. Just don't watch it.
243,Had so much potential. Predictable. Slow moving. Meh action. I just kept waiting for the twist or turn.
244,The acting in this movie is AWFUL. The fight scenes were poorly filmed/ cheesy and the soundtrack/audio to build suspense was nearly nonexistent. I was really looking forward to seeing this as I love Jessica Chastain. I'm so confused on how this movie with A list actors is such a failure. I created an IMDB account JUST so I could vent about my extreme level of dissatisfaction. I have never been motivated to write bad reviews I don't even yelp but this movie did it.
245,Great cast of actors unfortunately they now have to live with the fact that they took part in this cluster**** of a film.
246,"In the end, I still couldn't understand what I just watched."
247,"Don't know where to start and where to end. I genuinely believe that producers are holding hostages the Farell and Malkovic families and they had to star in this epic fail movie.
The movie has no start and no end. It's all over the place. I was longing for the movie to end.
Save yourself time and money.
It's more exciting watching the empty wall in your house."
248,Disappointed to say the least. Chastain is a great actor usually but the script is weak the the direction is poor.Fight scenes along with over the top fight noises ruin the film even further.Stay away.
249,"If I could give a review lower than ONE it would have to be MINUS 100. This totally bad movie is an insult to most viewers as I see by other reviews. No wonder there is so much killing in America when writers, producers and directors come up with something this disgusting. My only wish is that the ending was different with her getting killed, that is what she deserved. So sad to see some good actors in this, they must be really hard up for money to do it."
250,"I have no idea why Jessica Chastain accepted this role or was cast. There is no denying her abilities as an actor, but action star is definitely not her forte. Compared to the amount of literal blood and sweat Hollywood's best action stars put into their roles. Her appearance in this film just comes across as lazy. Outside of that the script sucks and the plot is so thin and predictable."
251,"Top hit woman goes all over the world killing people and getting paid a large amount of money................but also has a problematic family. Yes we get it.
Get Carter, The Mechanic and many more films would be better veiwing than this."
252,Car window in minute 5:45 end after in minute 7:49
253,"Ava (2 out of 5 stars)Ava is an action thriller that gives Jessica Chastain the action star power. And hoping it would become an assassin franchise like Bourne series. Sadly, the story was wasted. Kind of like a poorly done Bourne movie. An assassin Ava has an awry target. Which puts a target on her back. And lets add a dull sub plot of her trying to take care of her family after she disappeared for years. Boring story. Dull script that does not do anything with the characters. Tate Taylor direction is dull and the action sequences are boring and poorly done.It does have a great cast Jessica Chastain, Colin Farrell, Common, and John Malkovich. Sadly, all there performances are wasted with flat acting from a bad script."
254,"One of the worst action movies I have ever watched ! Great cast .... why on earth they made this movie !!!?
Don't watch it !..."
255,"The first scene showed promise as did the intro music. The film imploded seconds after. They could have least had Jessica C workout in the gym for six months if she's going to be fighting an entire army.Worst release of 2020. Then again, it's been one of those years for everything."
256,"Cheap , shallow , with pathetic dialogues !
I can imagine Steven Seagul starring here (wouldn't be worse lol)
Avoid like plague"
257,"Soooo boring and bad movie, no story, no good performance, no good music or soundtrack! Nothing"
258,"Great cast, horrible story. Actually, no real story. An assassin movie that doesn't know if it's an assassin movie or old love story. Two stars instead of 1 because I managed to watch the whole thing. Why did they hate each other so much? Who ran everything anyways? Who cares. Waste."
259,"It could be a decent action flick, but the dialogues are so bad that almost obliterated any good entertainment from the action shots. The tension between sisters is super lame and Common just showed how bad he is as an actor, absolutely appalling.
I still love Jessica Chastain but she might as well erase this bad experience from her career."
260,"Some big names in this movie. Sure, they all give decent performances but everything about this is average at best.Don¬¥t waste your time on this."
261,Extremely annoying waste of time with poor casting choice and even worst story
262,"Did Farrell and Malkovich stumble onto the wrong set? Started off with 3 minutes of promise and just went pear shaped from then out. The story line, the acting (what can you really do with such A poorly scripted story). Methinks Colin and John are friends of Chastain and did her a favour to lend their names to this sham!!
What a crying shame. I'm sure they're all embarrassed now."
263,Its made for kids bad bad bad action nothing good nothing new
264,"It's hard to say what this movie tries to be. An action movie? A spy thriller? A hired killer's psychogram? Jessica Chastain sees to it the latter works, but it doesn't seem to be the intended focus. The ""thriller"" aspects are rather bland and predictable. If we consider it ""decoration only"", then one could say it is working in that modest fashion. It is however nowhere near a ""deep intrigue"". The facade of a spygame may help to establish suspense of disbelief, if barely. Personally I found the few drawn out action scenes a bit misplaced, taking themselves too seriously to be a good Bond'ish ""super agent joyride"", but still not ""realistic"" enough to hold my breath in suspense. Personally I like female action heroes, but if they take several punches from a trained man (be it just that cannon fodder soldier) w/o any visible effect I can no longer go along with that serious attitude. Not that a woman can't believably win - it's just that they should do so in a different fashion. Athletics, superior technical fighting skills, pain resistance, surprising a male opponent with unexpected ferocity: There's many things I can believe. This very feminine agent however should not be asked to pull off the toughness of a Brienne of Tarth. Not even once. That's just killing immersion. Also it is either unnecessary (for the spy game), or not enough (for an action flic).
Overall nothing is really bad here, but nothing is outstanding either. There's several masterful actors here, starting with Jessica Chastain, but it's not the kind of film to really build on that either. Kind of a waste really.
Everything is decent, some of it pretty good even, but... nothing is committed to. Ultimately I've enjoyed it and didn't spot any ourageous flaws, so the 6/10 can be called deserved. My excuses to the cast here: Simply can't justify a better rating."
265,"Ava is a melodramatic TV show about a family in discord, at least it probably was intended to be, but then someone thought it would be a good idea to add Atomic Blonde-like action scenes and John Wick-like ending sequel bait.And it's not even that bad, the writing is mostly good, the cast is great and they deliver good performances (except for probably Common, he's charismatic but not a good actor, which is fine since it's not his profession - he's a rapper). Geena Davis is having all the fun in this film, and John Malkovich is great as always. Personally, I think that Jessica Chastain is a little miscast for the role. If her character was more of a spy or a stealth assassin it would've been fine, but she's sort of both - a stealthy infiltrator and a commando-like mass murderer, and her build doesn't really indicate that she can throw trained men in gear the way she does.It would've been easier to appreciate the film if it was clear what was intentional and what wasn't. There are lots of inconsistencies in Ava's character. She does this weird asking questions thing probably to help herself with her conscience after killing ""the people who do bad things"" but she has no problem with killing armed forces that are just there to protect their superior commander, and they probably have families too you know. The ending was also a little confusing, for a second there I thought that Ava and Farrell's character had a minute where they've seen their similarities and probably the film would go for a more creative and weird ending (they probably did that intentionally), but he still killed her father-figure so that would've been a stretch. Instead, they just got tired I assume (like in Atomic Blonde). At some point, I thought the film would get darker and more desperate (I surely would've appreciated this) but no, it just ends with a sequel bait like in John Wick.Having this much dialogue and family drama is not even that bad, the problem is that this combination doesn't work the way they did it. This family is not interesting enough for you to get invested into old father-daughter problems, the love triangle, the gambling subplot, and more. It doesn't help that we did not see how Ava became what she is now, we get a brief slideshow that gives some facts, but that's about it.If it was just an action film, it would've been cliche but passable, I guess. The action is far away from Atomic Blonde levels, there were lots of cuts and obviously Malkovich can't really do this better due to his age. Ava looks scared in most of the action scenes as well. There are not that many action scenes and they are not interesting or pleasant to look at in any way.The addition of the family stuff just drags the film down, IMO. And even though the writing wasn't as terrible as I would've expected, I still didn't find much to hold on to in this."
266,The film sounds like it copied or was heavily inspired by The Killer 1989 starring Chow Yun Fat. I will update my review upon release in America.
267,Shocked! With the line up of talent in this movie is was plain and simple ... terrible.
268,I have never written a review before but this movie made me. Terrible story and a waste of great actors. I really don't know how I got to the end.
269,A really bad movie with a bad story and action scenes was made without thinking and without paying attention to details. The dialogues of the actors are limited and vague. You can compare the action scenes of this movie with John Wake movie and the spy and stealth scenes with movies like Red Sparrow and Anna and realize that this movie is a disappointing movie in this type of movies.
270,"Another sad attempt to make female assassins relevant. Seems like everyone trying to capture the Black Widow story-lines...even using other redheads, sigh."
271,"The protagonist is a female assassin with a military background, works for a clandestine black ops unit has to fight for her own survival as the unit she works for wants her dead since she got curious as why the targets are targets in the first place. Yup, that's the whole plot . Good action scenes and solid performances by Jessica Chastain and John Malkovich, as for the rest of the movie there is no polite way of saying it , but just plain horrible . It won't be a surprise if majority of the viewers walked out of the theaters within the first 20-25 minutes ."
272,"I do not understand how Jessica Chastain, Colin Farrell and John Malkovich are doing in such boring thing."
273,"So... this is yet another predictable and lame action movie with a flimsy female character that we are supposed to believe could kill any man 10 times her size and weight with her bare hands... OK... Let's hire a construction crane and suspend our disbelief for about 90 minutes... Now we have to believe that there is a secret ""black-ops"" organisation of assassins who identify themselves with lengthy digit sequences each time they pick up the phone, but... who actually know each other... Let's get another crane... and next we have to believe that the all-knowing boss who lives a secluded life by a lake with his family (in an absolutely gorgeous house) has trained her also flimsy teenage daughter to be an assassin... Let's get another crane... and so on, and so forth...
Jessica Chastain, Colin Farrel, John Malkovich... What a waste of talent. Or what better example that money can buy anything?
I give it 2 stars: one for the movie poster, another for the fight scenes. Great job there (I wonder... if there wasn't such remarkable fight choreographers at Hollywood nowadays... would this movie have ever been produced?)"
274,"Could have been better , action was dull slow and amateurish.
Didn't believe it for a moment .
The actors can't save this mess from its stupid plot ."
275,"I really like films such as Salt, Red Sparrow, Peppermint, etc. and I really like Jessica Chastain, so I was really looking forward to watching this movie. But even Chastain couldn't save this turkey. The whole backstory with her family was boring and irrelevant. The addiction part I suppose was intended to give her character depth, but it was just tedious. And the fight scene in the nightclub was just embarrassing. Colin Farrell's character had potential but was underused."
276,"Not bad. Jessica Chastain is a good actress but this one might be too much for her. Anna, Atomic Blond, La Femme Nikita are better femme fatales. John M. is always nice to see on the screen."
277,"When a 45kg (100lb) woman kicks a 100kg (220lb) man and sends him flying backwards 2meters, then you KNOW that you're watching a bad movie. And apart from the lack of realism that the movie has, there's also the typical plot-holes such as a highly trained assassin going for a jog, but having nothing to protect themselves with except a pocket knife... the movie has such a farcical amount of 'false suspense' and unnecessary hand-to-hand fighting scenes that this movie honestly deserves nothing more than 5/10. Anyone rating this thing higher than 7/10 should have themselves checked for a brain tumor, because this movie doesn't come even close to something like John Wick or Jason Bourne or The Equalizer (which are all 7/10 or higher movies).Honestly, if you're looking for an action movie to take up almost 2hours of your time, then rather re-watch some of the really good ones like 'Man on Fire' or 'Matrix' or 'Terminator 1,2,3' or something like that, because this movie is just plain bad."
278,"The girl killer, killed 41 pople for money, and a hundred, probably, when tryin to get away. its not reasonable to assume people will care about her personal misfortunes. i actually wanted her shot when i saw her shooting around at anyone.
the best thing is G.Davis.
movie is still entertaining enough."
279,I will keep this brief - this film is appalling - there is nothing nothing redeeming about it - from Colin's Oirish accent - be gorrra be gosh top o' da mornin' - a 5 yr old could write a better script than this which leads me to the point how do these films constantly get made?
280,I love Jessica Chastain and I thought a good spying/action movie would really suit her. It does. But the story led absolutely nowhere and her character terribly lack depth so I really couldn't get attached. The rest of the act is just supporting this very unconvincing story. Shame because Malkovitch and Farrell are also good. So all in all a waste of time. A lot of blood and action scenes for a very average experience.
281,I'm just glad it was on Netflix and I didn't have to pay for it.
282,"OK. I have never done this before. Reviewed a film whilst watching it.But Ava turned up on Netflix, today, and I already had thoughts on the film so why not.So I've currently paused it around the 14:45 mark.A few things occurred to me. Firstly, it lacks that Hollywood sheen you normally get with thrillers. It almost feels like they had some budgetary constraints. Secondly, It seems fairly straightforward so far. Thirdly, the direction seems a little off, as if this may be the director's first or second film. As an example, there is a singer on stage and everyone in the audience is dutifully lined up, no pockets of people, just uniformly spaced out people (both in the literal and metaphorical sense) just nodding their heads gently to a ballad. It's like the director said, ""right you lot, stand there look like you're nodding to the music"". Anyway, initial thoughts. Back soon.Ok, back now (18:32). Just a quick note. The writer(s) has(have) added a few nods to us oldies (lines like ""Hey Jude"" or when Geena Davis is introduced they reference her disappearance from our screens of late and also a nod to ""the long kiss goodnight""). Also, even the camera work looks amateurish. There is something TV movie about this (and I mean late 90s TV movie). Let us watch more.26:44 - So our introduction to John Malkovich....in Normandy France. Now I'm getting the impression someone has pulled strings to get some of these actors into this film because they took a crew to France (I honestly think they did) rather than have Malkovich travel (he is a French resident). Anyway, let's carry on. Surmising. None of that is true (probably). On a side note, you can tell two seasoned actors who know their craft when you see Malkovich and Chastain together.34:45 - I really wanted to know Tony's (the alcoholic) life story. Oh well. Back to the plot.44:30 - actions sequences are a bit meh (well you just have to look at the action stuff everyone else is coming up with to realise this is meh). In any case, I'm getting into it. The ""big name"" actors are definitely holding this film up.54:05 - Pffft. Pointless side story with pointless action sequence. I'm now getting sidetracked here. The script is a little bit here and little bit there. It's lacking I'll be honest. I'm really not caring about many of these characters. Still now I'm nearly an hour in, let's carry on. May be the third act improves. What is this film trying to be?67:23 - This film really doesn't know what it wants to be. It's a bit of this and a bit of that but nothing complete. It's got action sequences with moments of supposed ""pathos"". Just isn't working and I am getting bored and uninterested. I can only guess (and hope) soon enough they're gonna throw in a mega action sequence.71:52 - there is a lot of ""buzzwords"" to do with spying, thrillers, espionage, assassination....code words, protocols and so on....like there is a big organisation which this film will never get into. Just talks the talk but does not walk the walk. At least when John Wick uses words like parabellum...you find Out all about it....this uses management and such....but who the hell are these guys? Banging my head here.75:14 - you know that scene in Austin Powers when a henchman gets killed and then there is this little side joke about no one really thinks about the henchmen's family, his dreams so on....well I'm beginning to feel sympathy for the henchmen in this film. She's been paid to kill 41 people...but absolutely zilch to kill the thousands of poor hard working henchmen. Honestly, a henchman in this film is turning out to be like a red shirt.86:55 - Ok decent fight sequence and unnecessary let's stop and chat a bit moment but ok that perked it up a bit. Now we are heading to the end. It doesn't make sense what just happened. If I was going to want someone dead, I wouldn't personally do it....if I was the part of an organisation that had lots of people to do it for me.89.59 - acting still good (ish) but simply put this film is frankly not worth wasting your time over....and it ends. Well at least one good thing came out of watching this....at least I can tell others not to bother. Bit of a snore fest TBH."
283,"So much in this movie fell flat. Generic story with nothing new to offer. No back ground on characters.
Just a real boring film with no story.
I found the fight scenes looked so fake it took any enjoyment from an already rubbish movie.
Just proves that big names are not all you need to make a hit."
284,Wronged women going rogue is becoming a theme- Jennifer Garner & Blake Lively have similar films but here Jessica Chastsin is an assassin so she's all trained up. This movie lies heavily on formula and has a very cheap feel for such a big star. I expected something for complex.
285,"For today's audiences, action films are box office $$$.Chastain is a very good actor, not action action film fodder.She deserves better than a badly conceived beat-em-up."
286,"The trailer revealing most of the movie was a bad sign, reminding me of B movie trailers on old video cassettes. I love the leads so I tried to like it but it is only sporadically entertaining. I also found it impossible to sympathise with a character who killed multiple innocents throughout the film and I actually rooted for anyone fighting the lead, which is another bad sign. Disappointing overall."
287,"Same old story, same old happenings, same old end.
Yes but since there are no new movies to watch, so one cant complaint much. In these covid times, if there is a new movie it is a treat nevertheless.
So since there is nothing else to watch, give it a try. Good watch to consume a bucket of popcorn's and just dont expect a lot."
288,I wish I could give it a 0 star ... it's not even entertaining... seriously what's a point of wasting so much money and talent and energy for this garbage of a movie!!!
289,Why do you have to make such movies? Just give away the money for some cause that would make me happy!
290,"Initial Thoughts:
The first thing that comes to mind upon finishing ""Ava"" is ""Wow... That was bad."" This film was the longest hour and a half of horrible hand-to-hand combat sequences with a bunch of unrealistic gunfighting I've seen in a long time. Unfortunately, there seemed to be no passion in how the fighting sequences played out and that was only part of the downfall to this film.Going further into passion, or in this case, emotion. There was none. From start to finish there was no true build-up that lead to a fight or an ""emotional"" family conversation. Everything felt so bland. None of it felt convincing enough to say, ""Yeah, I feel for them"", or ""Heck yeah win this fight!"" The easiest way to describe this film is a cross between the ""Bourne"" and ""John Wick"" series, but with worse choreography.Possibly the only good part of the film was the story. I could feel where the director was coming from trying to make this a movie about a woman with hard pass who overcomes life's difficulties and becomes this killing machine. Unfortunately, the intention and execution are at opposite ends of the spectrum, and as stated above, causes this film to fail.Before I get to my overall portion I will say this. If you're looking for a film that offers a kick-ass female lead, with a great story, and worth your time. My recommendation would be to watch the film ""Anna"" (2019). I don't have a blogged review of the film, but I did rate it 7/10.Overall:
Not a very engaging film. For all its many action sequences, this film falls through the cracks for me. Not emotional. Not long enough. And not even an ok execution of the story. This film I wouldn't recommend, but I would recommend ""Anna"" (2019) (7/10).Enjoy the show!"
291,"Saw this in my Netflix banner. Everyone sees this movie as a cliche stuff. But cliches are sometimes good, here everything went bad. Bad cast, bad story, bad fighting everything. Movie started really good and felt like some hit man stuff is way ahead. But disappointed when it reached almost half. Do not waste your time for this netflix movie."
292,Sad to see actors like collin farrel in a disgusting project like this.. There was not even a single moment to like about this film. I wish i had not wasted 40 mins of my life watching this crap.. please dont
293,"I am such fan of assasin, badass character movies and was so excited to watch this movie. Waited patiently for it to be released on Netflix but was utterly disappointed. It was hard to sit through the entire movie. Had to push myself to give a chance to Ava. Ridiculous action scenes, unreasonable story line with nothing connected to each other. There were so many whys by the end. Such a waste of great actors. The entire planning and directing seems to have been done over zoom with the director and actors in their pyjamas. The global pandemic has certainly taken toll on action films."
294,"Just sad that it wants to ride on other movies like Atomic Blonde, Red Sparrow and Anna. It is yet another clich√© film."
295,"This movie lacks a good script and has some of the worst action movie choreography I've seen in some time. Despite having a badass lead for the movie they really didn't produce anything of value to show her talent. Usually these types of action movies lack good dialogue but can make up with decent to good action scenes, but yikes. This movie ain't it. I really don't even think they tried hard to make this movie good, low effort performances and an all around terrible production."
296,Great cast and they messed up the rest. And I have to right more as my review was deemed too short but there was nothing else to say.
297,What a deception... I wonder how and why is it that such talented people participate in such horrible productions?I couldn't get over half of the film and even that had been too much..
298,"This was a disappointment. Let me start by saying I'm a huge Jessica Chastain fan and she's still great here. She proves to be a great choice to lead an action movie. But she's almost too good for this movie. The screenplay can't decide which movie it wants to be; either a assassin on the run story or a dramatic family showcase. The direction doesn't do much to clear it up, having no creative touch. Colin Firth is a decent Villain but the film can't decide what he wants to be either. Other than Jessica, the other big plus is the beautiful scenic spots outside. But alas, Jessica's great and committed Performance remain the only reason to watch."
299,They end it up like there will be another movie following lmao. I didnt get why they try to kill her. Probably i fell asleep somewhere in the middle.
300,"This movie was so bad, Action scenes where awful, really badly played out, with by the looks of it really bad CGI'd gun fire. I had to fast forward most of this to see if there's any good scenes and there wasn't. It was trying to be Atomic Blonde and failed really badly because it had nothing original at all. If you wanna see a woman in action see Atomic Blonde or Peppermint."
301,It was a solid 6/10 before the final fight scene. It was just so bad. Simon just walks off. With no car. No back up. It just makes zero sense and took away from the whole film. John Malkovich is incredible as usual. He is why it is a solid 6 until the end. If they removed the whole Michael storyline it may even have been a 7/10.
302,"Who thought a mix of melodrama and assassin movie would work well!? A very generic action story + that family-whatever issues haunting (including an AA session) our killer queen make this movie, well not too bad but a rather wasted opportunity. There are some well executed action-scenes but they can't save Ava - the drama elements of the movie did not convince me and felt somehow out of place and redundant. All in all not recommended."
303,"This is one of those typical movies where we could see crime and drama and that is it. Nothing to see. But unlike worse movies at least it looks like a movie, meaning good recording, intro, effects, and actors. Just the story is bad and because of bad story, nothing is happening in the movie except common predictable boring stuff. What is special here tough is that movie is showing lot of random micro events and geographical locations, including my city and a person I know in one of footage. So if this movie had some story, purpose, surprise, lesson it would deserve more rating stars."
304,"The lone redeemable quality of ""Ava"" is Ava aka Jessica Chastain herself. With a cogent display as an assassin; she indeed helped me get through an otherwise impoverished execution!Barring our main assailant, everything else had a rough showing. From a shoddily written plot which had loosened up quite a bit in the process to a coerced implication of romantic interest & family countenance. It just didn't feel right!The action is fine I guess, keeping in mind, its fair share of competent gunfights & hand to hand combats, subsequently providing subordinate entertainment value. Still far away from any appeasing outcome though.A slackened screenplay failing to deliver justice plotwise which was supposed to be a high octaned one. Feeble nature of the writing; especially on the characters' front didn't help either. Emotions fell flat, inclusion of inessential dramatic aspects made it look ill-suited to the core cause. The reason simply being, individual on-screen personalities never got their due establishment in the very first place.In brief, it was an improper treatment; that failed to bear any fruitful results in the end."
305,"Jessica, Jessica, I can understand Malkovich who while a fine actor does end if career movies like this. But you are young and talented and you should run for the hills the next time you see a script like this."
306,Just above barely watchable. No likeable characters. Today's generation is ruining action movies.
307,"Jessica Chastain isn't credible as a tough assassin, the action scenes are too desapointing. Main character is too emotional. Nothing interesting in the story. Just a waste of time"
308,Considering the acting talent this film is just not really worth making the effort to see.The story is just far too shallow and tries to cover far too many bases.Overall it became tedious and predictable.
309,The main character is not not a good fit for this role at all. Not sure what the producer was thinking??
310,"It is definitely not a 7 or 8 but also not a 1 or 2. The story is a cliche but there are no plot holes. The acting is not so bad and the action is also not so bad. There are no bright sides in the movie, but at least you can go through it to the end."
311,"There to hundred of movies like Ava, but Ava might be one of the worst among the list. The plot is nothing new, it contains addiction, a broken family, and being hunted by her own people. Movies with this overdone plot can work, this does not however. It is just an all around lazy movie. Lazy writing, acting, and special effects. Do not waste your time.On the bright side, this is nowhere near the worst movie of the year.29/100."
312,"AvaThis movie lost its was a little as it tried to run two story lines simultaneously, the slick international hitman and her handler and the recovering addict daughter trying to re-establish her familial attachments.As a result the movie became baggy and ponderous about half way through as the back storylines of so many characters needed to be established. Due to time we ended up with the usual stereotyping of ""hoods"" and ""damaged"" families and it all became glaringly superficial.Some of the acting was suspect and John Malkovich merely played himself expertly, Jessica Chastain seemed to rely on cheekbones and a bobcut to get by doing little and Colin Farrell overworked it, the whole thing was ""hammy"".Overall I was bored and fidgeted from about halfway, I give it at most a 5"
313,"It just really missed the mark. The action was bland and uninspired and the dialogue was awful. Wait til it's free or better yet, don't bother."
314,"I love Jessica Chastain. I found the idea of her as an assassin/action hero intriguing. With the all star cast, how could it not hit the mark? The fight scenes weren't terribly exciting or believable. She was no John Wick.End of the day, okay to watch...but not a great movie."
315,"Retired assassin, now an out of shape soccer mom of three, loses her van keys and goes through hell to find them."
316,..... and so sad that all these classy actors took part. A very unconvincing performance in every way with an overused storyline.
317,"They pay 1.2 billions to every actor, that's the only reason the have to work in this movie"
318,"Actors: JChastain - who doesn't like her. - is pretending to be an athletic assassin. Why do all these great actors even sign up for a movie like this? There's also a rapper appearing on screen. He has the charisma of a plant.
Story: written on a sunday afternoon, besides the pool? One long list of clich√©s.
Locations: boring
Dialogues: uninspired
Lessons learned: It's not easy to make a good action movie!
Final thaught: the movie has an open end. I really hope there is no sequel."
319,"Will there be a second part??This is the American version of ANNA, but ANNA is much better!!!"
320,"Other reviewers here have made numerous great points already as to why you should avoid this mess..Jessica Chastain, John Malkovich, and Colin Farrell do a good job, as expected. However, the writing and directing are horrible. The fight scenes are boring. The visual effects, while not overly abundant, are very poorly utilized when they do appear. There are countless, useless story plots. The decisions some of these ""trained killers"" make is absolutely ridiculous.A shootout in a hotel in Boston? No problem, it'll take 180+ seconds for an alarm to go off or for anyone to even react. A big fight in the middle of Boston Common, the biggest park in the downtown area with constant foot traffic regardless of time of day, along with ANOTHER gunshot in the park, and there's NO ONE around and no reaction for at least 90 seconds. If you've ever been to Boston, you know the BPD are ALWAYS around the downtown / Boston Common area. That, and there are also pedestrians all around the park at all times of day.The subplot with Michael (Common; a supremely talented musician, but a not-so-talented actor) and Ava's alcoholism are both ultimately pointless.They set us up for a sequel, too. Good luck to us all, we're going to need it."
321,"This movie is really dull. Nothing you haven't seen before in a Hollywood action movie, with the exception of some things being done worse here.What really irks me is how Ava has a lengthy fight with someone in Boston Common, one of the busiest parks in the city regardless of time of day, and there was no one around / no reaction to the fight or a gunshot right by the street in the park. There's suspension of disbelief, and there's bad writing. You decide.Skip."
322,Why always Same kind of films... this is one of the worst film ever made with knowed actors. The rating should be -1. What a movie man.....
323,The movie stated off well and thought that this would be a good view. But after 10 to 15 minutes the movie started to get sloppy and boring not worth the while..
324,"This is a joke of a movie. Painful to watch. But as I said, Jessica Chastain manages to shine even here."
325,"There are movies, that have plots that were used a zillion times but the action, the choreography or good acting makes it enjoyable the zillion and first time. Well, this is not the case.
I can't believe the heroine, the fight scenes look like from the 70s B movies and the whole movie is predictable with some poor endeavors and plotholes trying to make the painfully used up plot a bit more interesting - to no avail.
Like I said, 3 stars because of Malkovich, he's good as always."
326,That was unfortunate...with such a great cast I am saddened to say I just watched something similar to a made for TV movie. How disappointing!
327,Way too much family drama. Action parts are barely OK but the movie drags on and on with all the family BS.
328,"Jessica Chastain is the only reason to watch this film. Without her it would rate 1 star only. It's like the writer has pieced this together from a thousand other genre similar B movies, then conned an A grade lead to lend it credibility. Truly dreadful."
329,"Predictable and barely original, ""Ava"" tries hard to be a different thriller but rarely succeeds.In this action-thriller, a deadly assassin working for a black ops organization, travels the globe specializing in high profile hits.A star-studded cast makes up for ""Ava"" being just another one of those spy thrillers we've all seen. Jessica Chastain kicks ass and Colin Farrell is terrific. The script and story are redundant to the point where it's exhausting to watch these films over and over again. The genre needs something new and the female lead is a good start but it's been done before. Watching the cast is what kept my eyes peeled to the screen, if not this is just another waste of time in quarantine.Follow @snobmedia for all reviews!"
330,"Ava Faulkner (Jessica Chastain) is a professional assassin. She was an over-achiever, a drunk, and then a soldier. She is constantly battling her addiction. She got recruited by her superior Duke (John Malkovich) into the company. To his dismay, she continues to ask her victims questions before she kills them. Duke's boss Simon (Colin Farrell) is concerned. Ava returns to visit her family after an 8 year absence. Her sister Judy (Jess Weixler) is dating her ex Michael (Common). Her mother Bobbi (Geena Davis) is in the hospital for a minor heart attack.This has lots of big name actors. This needs to decide what it wants to be. It has all the elements of gritty personal drama and flashiness of an international murderous conglomerate. In one moment, it has some realism and in another, it has all the fighting gun action of the latest John Wick film. It hits me all at once in Saudi Arabia. I'm fine with the exaggerated fighting in the hotel room. I'm excited by her pretending to be the damsel in distress. Taking on a squad of heavily armed soldiers is just being unnecessarily over the top. They don't seem to know how serious to take this movie. It ends up being a B-movie with a lot of talent who are cashing in some cheques."
331,"The movie is worth the watch but frustratingly falls in many plot points and execution points that could have made it even greater, I think the makers of this movie literally said let us jump on the John Wick band wagon and make a similar movie that will be as successful because that was successful. But what they did was fail to tell their own story well. For one the movie centers around intelligent and skilled assassins and has all these ingredients for real intrigue but fizziles out with the antagonist and supposed assassin's boss running to a conviniently secluded spot that would facilitate killing him inconspicuous.Even the way the movie ends you can tell they are pandering almost off-puttingly to requests of a sequel, which a really good movie need not do.the even more frustrating thing because it had all the ingredients to be great (great cast, great premise, etc) but could have done better with unpacking the plot and making the fights more believable and compelling."
332,"So it was an average movie with some decent action, worth a watch, but I have to say I've seen about 5 of these ""hit-woman"" movies in the last 5 years and they're wearing a little bit thin. It doesn't matter how well trained you are, unless your Bruce Lee's sister, a 55 kg woman ain't dropping a 400lb bloke.Anyway, my major complaint is with the trailer. It's the full movie in 45 seconds. Watch that and you've seen the movie, plot, the lot."
333,"The story itself isn't too bad even though very predictable. However the montage and the actors game is very disappointing, looks like very cheap movie."
334,"Jessica Chastain and John Malcovic .... must be a great movie or so I thought . Boy was I wrong. As in previous reviews , I agree it started off very promisingly although it treads a well worn path , but I think its attempts to bring something "" new "" to the genre resulted in it being "" neither fish nor fowl "" . Other contributors have commented that this is not Ms Chastains type of role but I thought she was as good as most and better than many at portraying a female assassin and John Malkovic gave his usual John Malcovic performance , if steady as opposed to spectacular . Geena Davis laboured ( as did the rest of the cast ) with a contradictory script involving complete changes of character , but managed it pretty well . That's the best I can say about this ridiculous movie other than , for once , the worst performance didnt go to the constantly accent changing and hugely overrated , Colin Farrell . That award goes to the guy supposedly playing Michael"
335,"To give you everything you need to know about the Jessica Chastain assassin flick AVA is to read the IMDB description of the film:""Ava is a deadly assassin who works for a black ops organization, traveling the globe specializing in high profile hits. When a job goes dangerously wrong she is forced to fight for her own survival.""Pretty generic, right? There are only about a dozen films that I can think of off the top of my head that would fit this description. So...what separates this one to make it worth watching?Not much.Chastain stars as Ava, a deadly assassin who...oh, you get it. When the ""job goes dangerously wrong"", she heads back to Boston and into the arms of her loving family - who want nothing to do with her.Chastain is good, but nothing special as Ava...she seems to be able to pull off the physicality of this role quite well (like Jennifer Lawrence in RED SPARROW or Charlize Theron in ATOMIC BLONDE). The head of the shadowy organization that Ava works, played by Collin Farrell, is generically shadowy and Farrell plays it professionally with a touch of ""over the top"" acting (but not too much). The great John Malkovich is a spark of energy in this film as Ava's mentor. Mr. Malkovich, as is his want to do, eats the scenery in every scene that he is in. Under normal circumstances, this would annoying, but in this film, it is welcome. Ioan Gruffudd and Joan Chen show up (briefly) as adversaries of Ava and all of these components makes the ""assassin side"" of this film work well enough.The ""family side' of this film just doesn't work - except for one scene.Common is just plain bad in the underwritten role of Ava's former lover who is now married to her sister. Jess Wexler is forgettable as Ava's sister (I even had to look her up on IMDB to remind me of who played this role) and Geena Davis - as Ava's estranged mother - looks like she is just there because she owed someone a favor.Except for one scene.And that's the interesting thing about this film. Right in the middle of this very generic, very ordinary film is a ""come to Jesus"" meeting between Ava (Chastain) and her mother (Davis). This scene was ""Oscar worthy"" with 2 very good actresses going back and forth with each other (with Davis dominating the scene). I gotta think that this scene was the only one Davis read when she agreed to do this film and was pouting during her other, generic scenes.Director Tate Taylor (who took over when the original Director was bounced when past sexual indiscretions were unearthed) and writer Matthew Newton bring nothing new to the genre. It is all very...generic. The action scenes are professionally done, but generic. The situations are contrived and...generic. The acting is...scenery chewing generic. The ending is predictably generic.All-in-all an ""entertaining enough"" generic action flick - except for that one scene (and maybe Malkovich's performance), they make it worthwhile.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10 - it really is a ""5"", but will add a point for Malkovich and another point for the mother daughter scene). - and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"
336,"If this was some sort of satire on the action genre solid 10. But I can't tell, so it's a 4. It's really really bad lol. When I saw that 3D cgi flash grenade/smoke grenade I DIED LAUGHING. And I can't believe that John Malkovich agreed to act in this C-movie. Literally below B. MA was good never make an action movie again. THE MOVIE IS FILLED WITH CLICHES. Do not defend this movie. It is soooo bad. I have changed my review to 3 because I remembered the crap cinematography and directing on this ass film.Sorry not sorry,
Joe MammaP.S.
if you liked this movie you have minus 20 chromies."
337,"A decent ensemble of a cast what could've used some caffeine. A plot that was predicable. A backdrop of a city famous for its accent that luckily no one attempted to imitate. All that and more is featured in ""Ava"". Actually not much more is featured. Lemme ruin it for you. Gambling addicted ex boyfriend is engaged to Avas sister who is preggo. Avas mom and her reconcile after estrangement. Avas surrogate father and assassin trainer gets killed and she gets revenge. There. I saved you a $1.93 at Rebox. You're welcome."
338,"Cliched, derivative, dull nonsense. May be entertaining on a wet Sunday if you're bored. The action scenes are competent but I never felt like the lead was in danger.
Decent cast, all phoning it in. I suppose this is the future of the movie industry.
Poor dialogue, confused writing.
I could explain more but it would be a waste of everyone's time. Avoid."
339,"For context here, I went into this moving with very high hopes. On the one hand, I love Jessica Chastain with all my heart, and on the other, a movie about a female assassin? Sign me up. Unfortunately even the cast and the fact that it had some promise from the trailer could not save this total below average film.Even as someone who likes a good trashy movie, this film is SO disappointing. It starts out fine, turns mediocre, and then is so much garbage I turned it off with about 20 minutes left because I was sick of wasting my time. Seriously, don't watch this movie. If you want a fun female assassin, watch Killing Eve or literally any other movie."
340,"Don't waste your time, it's just boring and slow. the storyline is full of gaps and it doesn't make sense at all."
341,"This is diabolical. The fight scenes are embarrassingly bad, the sound effects comical, the editing cheap and the story drab and pointless. AVA is one of the worst films of the year, a total waste of a very strong cast and a whole 96 minutes of my life. Avoid."
342,"A classic holywwod movie! A girl from a family who becomes an assisin,after a broken family, no scenario, no plot, just a flat movie without escalation.Only guns, fight and family business and family drama."
343,"Violent scene every 20 mins, you won't be disappointed if you like this theme. Actress is the reason I watch this."
344,"The title character was simply absurd, story lines and motivations murky at best. Fight sequences were filmed so badly I couldn't tell if they were trying to make me feel every blow by swinging the camera back and forth or if they were so badly choreographed the camera guy was trying to mask them. I think the former."
345,One of the worst movies seen with such talented actors!
346,"It tries to hard to be a thriller, and misses
This might be better as a Hallmark Channel movie. This has the feel of being made up. The acting is poor. I was looking for something as good as Salt or Hannah , this isn't it. I started the rating at a 3, that was early. It's degreed to a 1. Wait, what's this, it's sponsored by Tide."
347,"It was bad!!!!Director did nothing,Actors did'nt even train how to hold a gun,Colin Farrel was good,Script was fine.My opnion:""waste of time"""
348,This movie is absolute trash. The fight scenes are unbelievable. The characters are unlikeable. The music was lifted from the nineties. I hope everyone's paycheck cleared because this was just a paycheck movie.
349,The whole movie is huhhhh?Why huh????????why this huhhhhhhhh?why this scene huhhhhhhh????Why this scene is necessary huhhhhhhh????????
350,"If you are looking for a silly movie that is entertaining half the run time, you will be entertain. Just fast forward family b-plot. Two main actors are great as always and that's a joy to watch. I guess business is business and they just need to keep producing new stuff, no matter how mediocre it is. I have 26 mins left minus family subplot, 12 mins give or take. Action scenes have shaky camera and quick edits hiding poor choreography, but it's still watchable and not a total disaster - it's quite fun actually."
351,"You have to spend good money on every part of the production and it's almost as if all money went to the actors. The writers were bad, they couldn't afford more of Jessica's double, consultants and coaches for fight scenes clearly got no budget or they were off the clearance rack, the family part was a huge distraction, why Common for that role? Btw, that casting director should never work again. There was no reason for Common. That was a waste of budget. You had two interracial situations for zero reason. All it did was cause distraction. There was also noooo reason for Colin Farrell. He talked a big game, only to be kicked in the knee and shot in the head... and they're assassins? Omg. This movie couldn't get worse. I watched the whole thing to prove that to myself. The whole movie could be summed up by looking at ""Ava's"" hair... vapid and cheap. I'm not mad that you wasted money on that movie... I'm mad that I stood up past my bedtime to watch it and it was horrendous. There were levels to the story that was so unfitting, distracting and ill planned. The director needs to never work again. They allows that lack of quality to happen? Ugh. I can't."
352,It is sad when i see a movie with this budget and yet they don't ask how saudi dress.
353,"Ava (2020) is about 75% chick flick, 20% action/thriller, and 5% what Roger Ebert would have termed a cigarette-smoking movie. The chick flick portions are a dreary mix of alcohol and substance abuse, sibling rivalries, family betrayal, domestic discord, and daddy issues. The daddy issues spill over into and often overshadow the action scenes, where the protagonist's mentor is a surrogate daddy figure confronting palace intrigue orchestrated by a pretender to the throne.The action scenes are well done with excellent fight choreography, but too few and too far between, and are nearly always confined - to a single room, the back seat of a SUV, a patio deck or a small section of a jogging path. They are often dimly lit, presumably to hide cables and the substitution of stunt performers.Political correctitude and inclusiveness often proves distracting in recent films, and Ava is no exception. However, the diverse pairings of combatants in Ava prove interesting, with women fighting each other and men, and an elderly man fighting a much younger one. But #MeToo seems to have trumped inclusion, as the assassination targets are overwhelmingly male.Ava is not a particularly likeable or sympathetic character. She has issues and insecurities, no love life, and tensions with her family, employer and ex- fianc√©. People fear her and respect her reputation, but nobody much likes her. Jessica Chastain does as well as can be expected with the script she's given - a mishmash of familiar tropes hobbled by compulsory woke elements.Smoking seems problematic. Ava smokes constantly and seems to inhale more smoke than fresh air. The effects seem obvious on Chastain's face, as she looks closer to 53 than 43, but also on her physiology, as she seems perhaps ten kilos over fighting trim. Yet she is supposed to be a top assassin, capable of defeating multiple highly-trained opponents in armed and unarmed combat. The fight scenes are well choreographed and Chastain seems to do much, if not all, of her own work. But when the action slows to a crawl, she looks more like a middle-aged soccer mom than a finely-honed killing machine who jogs for exercise, holds her breath for an extended period, and engages in exhausting fights that last longer than professional boxing rounds.While Ava doesn't seem to have a love life, she navigates her way through two bedroom scenes, but without removing her clothing. Both scenes seem more perfunctory than impassioned.Motivations seem a bit murky in both the chick flick and action scenes. Characters act in manners designed to facilitate plot progression, not as one might expect rational characters to behave under such circumstances. In one scene, a character abandons several weapons and walks away unarmed after a particularly tenacious character threatens to kill him.Ava asks her victims if they know why they're targeted for assassination. She seems to have a deep-seated need to know and to justify her own actions, although she seems remorseless. Yet, the filmmakers never realize that the audience also needs to know in order decide where their sympathies lie.Production values are more than adequate, with credible performances by Chastain, Malkovich, Farrell, Common, and Davis. The action plot suffers from a lack of originality, a surfeit of emotional baggage, one-dimensional victims, a lack of credible response from law enforcement which can't seem to figure out that Ava was in each of forty-one exotic locations at the time of high-profile assassinations and also in several hotel rooms that were shot up, and a more credible protagonist who either doesn't smoke or is actually short of breath after intense exertion."
354,"To start off, they kill off a very good actor in the first minute. Then the ""BLM"" actor looks like he is covered in plastic! I s-you-not! I have never seen an actor ""Common"" so bad or so badly made up!!! I stuck it out, hoping it would get better, but it did not. The big names just did not live up to the poor scripting.Common - leave the acting to professionals
Colin Farrell - worst accent I have ever heard
John Malkovich - Not an action star
Geena Davis - Just, well, old
Ioan Gruffudd - Why waste a star like this?So, my 10c? Leave it on the ""shelf""..."
355,"Excellent cast but a bit boring. Can't catch your attention.
The best: barely 90 minutes duration"
356,"Ava is another film where a skinny girl is beating up huge guys and kicking their ass,i dont need to tell you what i think about such films,they are very unrealistic and its message is from beginning till end to give unpowerment to women.When we talk about this quality it was fine at best,it didnt have nothing new in genre and it felt like a million of other films of same type that we seen in recent years,Jessica Chaistain was a solid lead and she sold her character in a solid way that was also somewhat enterteining.Action scenes were also very mediocore but i didnt expect nothing better before watching.Ava is in end another film that has solid action and characters but it doesnt distant itself from many others"
357,"Magnificent cast , no real story , boring events with no point of view what so ever , bad 90's fights choreography , extremely lazy righting and directing"
358,"Story make no sense. Only half of a hour from the beginning of this film is good. The rest is So bad. I wonder is this made as action or drama?
Only the reason for people to watch this is that Jessica Chasten leading this. Collin Farrell play the role which does not worth playing."
359,"This movie is such a bore. Chastain almost save this film from its dullness but the story killed it also, not only to mention it is ridiculous. A lot of character development in the film but still fell flat and dull. It seems like I over expect a lot in this film from the likeness of Old Guard, Lucy or Anna."
360,"Great actors wasted on the most ridiculous spy/drama/romance/addiction issues plot that is so splintered I'm astonished they could ALL suck; every story line, all 36 of them, are terrible. I promise you, you will not like this movie."
361,"Anything with Colin Farrel and John Malkovich can't be bad - so I thought. The ""softer"" side of the movie brought my rating up learning Ava's extremely complicated life and how she tried to make it better.The action side was just so unbelievable. First, Jessica Chastain may work for Interstellar or even Miss Sloan, but not as an action hero. The running seems are comical as she does not have an athletic physique, runs duck footed and has no muscle tone. Are we really to believed that she can out-fight 10 men in succession?Second, the movie never really tells you who the ""management"" is working for and why. She just is a hired assassin.Finally, the plot is too predictable.All-in-all it gets a 0 as an action movie, and 8 for a drama and an extra point for Colin Farrel."
362,"I'm soooo confused, what did I just watch? To say it was a surreal, almost existential experience would be putting it mildly. Amateur hour at the Apollo here people, avoid this frankly embarrassing, at best TV movie, that absolutely belongs on the Sc-Fi Chanel showing at 4am. That's it, that's all I have to say. Now go and watch Lucy for an honest to God existential experience! But in a good way! Goooo!"
363,"When I looked at the pretty decent cast list, I dared to hope that this wouldn't just be the same old formulaic hybrid acton film - but oh, well - one can but dream! Jessica Chastain in the title role is an assassin. When her latest job in Russia goes awry, her handler ""Duke"" (John Malkovich) tries to shield her from the oncoming storm as she seeks some sort of refuge with her estranged family (a poorly mother - Geena Davis; her sister and her boyfriend). Enter ""Simon"" (Colin Farrell) and some really tediously long fight scenes and, well you know the drill. I know I shouldn't have been surprised by the derivative nature of this, but Farrell has long since lost his on-screen charm; Malkovich adds surprisingly little and reformed alcoholic/druggie ""Ava"" has virtually no redeeming features to her character to make anyone care whether or not she lives/dies or just drinks herself into well deserved oblivion. Mercifully, it's only 90-odd minutes, but even then it frequently drags with a stilted dialogue and shallow characterisations. As an action movie, we have seen it all before, many times - and I would not bother if I were you."
364,"This is very in the middle. Acting, fighting, story, everything is meh. It tries to be more than what it is by adding an addiction element but it just doesn't work for this kind of movie. Everyone hum drums along knowing that this is just a paycheque. In some ways it reminds me of a poor man's A Long Kiss Goodnight, almost like a 20yr sequel to the original but definitely pales in comparison. I was kinda hoping Geena Davis would turn into some kind of badass rather than just a crap mom. If you need and hour and a half to kill and can't think of what to do; by all means watch this but don't expect it to blow your socks off by any means"
365,My kids fight better than AVA. This movie is like a poor man's last shot before death bed.
366,"Jessica, you got money to waste? Feed the hungry, have flush toilets built for the Native Americans but don't make stupid, unbelievable movies like this. You killed17 guys in the first action scene without missing a shot. In the final scene with Colin, you rough and tumbled without breaking or hurting yourself. Are you serious? I recommend people to see this just so they can say...WTF!"
367,"This mindless, politically correct, trendsetting, counterculture film habituates you up, and thus brings us down another rung in cheap trick action, pointless evil relationships, and totally smeared in blood ineptitude. This flicks lack of style and sophistication looks to bring you into the broad dark side of everything. The films tenor was especially suited to the bottom feeding, no talent, go with the flow twin sirens, writer Matthew Newton and director Tate Taylor. The outcome of all this and that is you've been had once again, by the invisible sticky fingered hand of Hollywood degenerates"
368,"With respect Jessica Castain has never impressed me as an actor. While she tries to emote she's completely two dimensional. In this film her portrayal of a dysfunctional assassin is less tragic than it is aggressively tedious. With the exception of Malkovich every other actor in this film is similarly flat and boring. Even then the Malkovich role could have been done by a stuffed toy so wooden is the direction for the character. The score is interesting until it plays all the time at which point it's simply annoying. Fractured plot lines and incomplete subplots remove any sense of tension and poor directing eliminates any chance of compassion for the heroine.
I'm convinced by how bad this is that the lion's share of the blame for this mess is on the director
If this is the future of action thrillers we are really in trouble"
369,"Go watch Salt
Go watch Bourne
Go watch Wick
It's sad with the pedigree of most of the people in this movie except for Common"
370,"To be able to suspend your disbelief for these types of movies, a certain amount of flair and style is required. Ava does not deliver. Watch Red Sparrow, Salt, Atomic Blonde, or Salt instead.In this case, the characters, situations, and their organizations are not at all believable and the film lacks in the style and wit that would otherwise help carry it.Otherwise competent actors such as Chastain, Farrell, Malkovich, and Davis meander in the pastiche.The closing narration followed the edgy synth breakbeats of the end title was a welcome reprieve.That doesn't mean it isn't enjoyable in its own way, and surely work and effort was put it, but the sum of the parts are below-average."
371,"You've seen one you've seen them all. It's not the worst vengeance, action thriller you've seen, but it's certainly not the best. I'm a big fan of Jessica Chastain fan but she's sadly completely unbelievable as the main character. One to avoid."
372,It's rare that I see good actors overact and just destroy a film. Add in Jessica Chastain's inability to coordinate a fight effectively on screen (I mean come on! Even post processing couldn't save the fights.) and you have a weak film with a script that's been done a thousand times.Skip this movie and watch YouTube videos of cats farting. It's more entertaining!
373,"Terrible dialog, boring sets, fake. So many stupid parts why spoil it. Go waste 2 hours."
374,You guys have successfully wasted my time. Thank you
375,"I just don't understand the point of making a movie like this. Money, time, professionals and that's what's made? Did not sympathize with a single character. Did not buy in to the story at all. How can some go so wrong when others are so good."
376,"There's potential in the story but the pacing is all off. Exposition told in quick take near the beginning starts off a jumpy and rather obnoxious narrative. The cast is great, but the characters need more fleshing out and development. Most of all the music was horrendous. It cheapened the whole vibe."
377,"The intro part was good and promising, then after the main title the decadence started. It is like a femme fatale wanna be, I couldn't figure it out yet whether the problem was with the actress, the character, the plot or the tree of them. I have no problem with this kind of 'modern' movies where the fighter is a girl against the world, but this movie crossed out all the limits almost near to the ridiculous, a non-athletic lazy problematic lady against the army, give me a break. After the 20 minutes I fast forwarded the movie and all looked the same and the ending also looked crap. Don't waste your time, there are tons of much better 'femme-fatale' movies if you like this genre. This will be for sure the kind of movie you will find as an option in a long way bus display TV or in a flight, very helpful to fall asleep."
378,"Why do ""assassin"" movies ALWAYS have the same plot?! Assassin has somehow run foul of their own employer or team and said employer now wants them assassinated... Boring"
379,"12/07/2020 A Writing/Script Example? John Malkovich delivers a not-so-original ""Pearl of Wisdom"" to the principle character Ava. Quote: ""Yours is not to reason why, yours is butt to do or die"". Now how quaint and poetic is that piece of lip-o-gram? Where have I herd that lion before? As stated in other reviews, there is nothing new nor exciting in this empty piece of film to stimulate viewers interest. I should note, John Malkovich was excellent in his part. The rest? Ho Hum - Average An hour and a half of the same old/same old nothing new. OK to watch but memorable it's NOT. In case I forget, I write this review primarily to remind myself to NEVER rewatch this movie ever again. Bon Appetit'"
380,"This is a perfect example of why I cancelled Netflix: Predictable, not authentic, dumb ""ex black ops"" whatever. Common is completely wrong for his role. Geena Davis is mediocre. John Malkovich has far too much dialogue. He is great if you can't sleep. The only decent action is the fight between Ava (Jessica Chastain) & Simon (Colin Farrell). He is well cast. I hoped they would run off together for a change. No way. It's what you expect: An open ending; meaning there will be (yawn) a sequel. Argh. Skip this pablum."
381,Slow sad poor copy of john wick better watch old movies on tv. Waste of time
382,"It's official Netflix will buy anything. I think I have a gift because 5 minutes in I knew the movie would be a disaster. If this was an attempt to show the strong female leading role it was weak at best. I was actually having anxiety watching constantly checking the timer to see when it would be over. The movie kept flatlining ""MEDIC!!!!!"""
383,Why even you need to make this film? Seriously! Why on earth someone will give it more than 1 star?
384,"Even a good cast and good performances (especially by Chastain and Malkovich) couldn't save this dreadful script. The lack of continuity of the film made it long and tedious to watch. Unfortunately, this is a miss."
385,"Not sure what the point of this movie was, a lot of different subplots but no focus. Ava doesn't really fit into a good action category which leaves it aimless. Decent enough acting and cinematography."
386,Could have been good but it wasn't. There's way too much family pap and it's also a weak script = cardboard characters that I didn't care about. 4/10
387,There was a moment I forgot I was watching the story of a hitgirl (or Hitwoman?) and I think it was because the story was difficult to follow. Not the worst of 2020 and I enjoyed Jessica Chastain and John Malcovich acting. A solid 6.
388,"The bad:
Jessica Chastain is miscast as an assassin. I adore Chastain in many of her other roles in the past, but she is a character actress and simply not suited to play a butch stereotype of an assassin in an action movie as this. Come to think of it, Jessica Chastain is well into her forties and it is rather laughable to see her fight younger assasins and butcher them without a sweat...More bad: the entire direction is NOT like a butch action movie should be. It's lacking in flashy action photography for example. The soundtrack is annoying, because it is pumped up and loud constantly while there is no action to be seen in many scenes. There is a fluffy, boring storyline, without any spark or punch. Even the presence of the great John Malkovich cant save this picture from drowning.Isnt there anything good to be said about it? No."
389,"Awwww, give it a chance. It does try hard. Good acting from Jessica, John and partly Colin. Poor on Common. He could take some acting lessons. Storyline is confusing at times and then at other times, you think you understand, maybe. All in all, it's a Salt 2.0 movie with Jessica unbelievably fighting off 7 Marines/army men all in one scene! That's how believable it is. But they do keep a straight face while doing it. I paid. $2.99 on pay TV to see this, so watched it to the end."
390,"After watching this movie, I was left a bit conflicted and tried to think about what I liked about this movie, and what I didn't like.Essentially, the story introduced a number of plot points that never went anywhere, which lead to a movie with no real motivation for the characters to really do anything.Why did the big boss have such a massive hard on for killing Ava? Because she went a bit off script?Why did Ava question earlier assassinations? Was there a shady agenda and she was killing the wrong people?The fight scenes were really well choreographed and the acting of the main characters was fine for this sort of movie.Common's acting in this was wooden and felt very much like he was going through the motions.I think if the plot was tighter and had more direction this could have been great. But unfortunately it was just ok."
391,Fighting scenes were slow and weak when I think of similar assassin movies in particular John Wick or Ninja Assassin. They could have been trained better to appear more solid. Just s thought as a viewer.
392,"Complete disaster of a movie. Only reason I gave it 6 stars instead of 4 is because of the incredible (wasted) talent.
Geena Davis and Common's acting was so bad it borderline cringe worthy."
393,"Pretty much as titled. There is no substance to this movie.At the beginning the movie attempts to have some world building. But unlike John Wick, all the information is shoved down the audience's throat, displayed on screen explicitly, instead of feeling like part of the assassin world.The movie then tries to create a backstory for Ava, but nope. The former love interest, the unfaithful father, and her alcohol addiction are terrible ideas, and boring. They explain only superficially how Ava ends up in her current occupation, instead of why. The movie is only 96 minutes and these subplots are a huge waste of time.Finally, the reason her superior wants her dead, her habit of talking to her targets, is not explored at all in the movie. The organization then fails to off their top assassin, twice, could have gotten away with it, but still insists on ruining themselves. Only because their top assassin talks too much to (soon to be) dead people?"
394,"Jessica Chastain as an action star?? ü§£ü§£ü§£
Very predictable rubbish attempting to rebrand Chastain as something other than a ginger android. This film felt like the cast lost a bet or owed the studio a favor, so they got stuck appearing in this ""film"" and phoned in the absolute minimum performance they could get away with. The only people who should be proud bbn of this work are the stunt crew, everyone else should be whipped mercilessly in the town square.
Any time a movie relies on Common as its leading love interest, you should immediately demand a refund and run far away from the screen."
395,"Okay, you're our best operative. You drink? No biggie. You talk to the victims? Whoa whoa whoa. We have to draw a line somewhere. Kill her.The main actors are big names and I thought they were a guarantee of quality. I was grossly mistaken. The first part of the movie is not bad, but the second ... It all went to hell. Lots of things unrelated. It seems like they invented scenes just to fill 1.5 hours. There is no tension, no sense of danger, everything is somehow silly and lukewarm. The story had potential, but the realization was criminal. I have to remember this director so I don't watch his film in the future. Unreal and boring - why didn't I listen to the commentators?"
396,"Not put together properly. . Frustrating to watch with good acting and a decent story so poorly told.
And the ex- fiance now sister's boyfriend seemed .....obtuse.."
397,"Long story short. I enjoyed the movie. Unfortunately when the action happened. It looked cheap, and fake. Good actors. Terrible action."
398,"Boring movie, slow at many portions. Action scenes okay."
399,So great to see Geena Davis again! Hurray! Why Colin would agree to be in this movie is a mystery. Not great fighting scenes. Not great story line. But always good to see Colin.
400,"Watch it if u wanna be annoyed. Cause it's not good. Or just watch it cause there was nothing else to watch. Why have so many known names in this movie plot is crap! Like r they saving the world? Whats the purpose of killing them? Ava has soo many issues daddy issues, depression, addiction to alcohol and drugs and then suicide tried to kill her self then fights Simon off. cmon where do u think people get the ideas how to kill them selves from!!!"
401,The movies had some great actors but sorry was just not up to par.
402,Another mild woman-forced protagonist action movie.
403,"Seriously why though? Why did this movie has so many good actors playing in it?
This is one of those female contract killer we've seen plenty of times in hollywood, like Salt and Anna. They all pretty much rely on a same trope which is contract killer wanted out and got chased by their own boss. The thing is, unlike Ava, Salt and Anna have interesting thing going on for them, they had meaty backstory, interesting characters, great plot and satisfactory conclusion.The only good thing about Ava is the opening scene with Jessica chastain and Ioan grufford, an assassin asking her target why they were targeted, it was interesting, it tells us the audience that perhaps the assassin grew conscience about what they were doing. But no, she was just asking so that her boss getting pissed and wanted to kill her.The main character, Ava, was so unlikeable. She's poorly written , there's nothing that made me connect or sympathized with her.
This movie adds so many unnecessary things and hoping it would make a good plot. An alcoholic, troubled family, love triangle between twin sisters, mafia boss, etc. They wanted this movie to be more than your regular assassin movie, they wanted drama and instead this movie plays more like a TV movie drama.The performance is nothing spectacular, nothing that stands out. The action scene was also just your run of the mill fighting, even seems terrible sometimes, which in my opinion is a CRIME in an assassin movie, you have to HAVE great fighting scene/action sequences. The ending was terrible. One of the saving grace of this movie is the score, my god they were so good it made me finished watching this just so I could listen to all of it."
404,"I couldn't even finish it, once she took out no less than 30 heavily armed MP's I knew it was time to turn it off and come back to reality. I understand trying to escape your life through film, but this bordered on a far more outlandish plot line than The Never Ending Story.."
405,"The film is somewhat repetitive with an unsuccessful attempt at excellence. We are talking about a classic action movie when the hero in red dress who's never defeated appears. as if we were watching the cinema of the nineties, but with modern technologies.The story is not well woven, as there are characters that were not adequately presented and events that were not completed.
events were transferred to another suddenly and unconnected, for example, a problem was raised in the film that AVA faces an ethical problem in killing without knowing the reason, but her bosses do not allow Speaking with the target. and from this standpoint, the film suggests that this is the main problem that the hero must search for, in order to complete the story. but on the contrary, the author transferred the problem to another form completely.The combat scenes are in vary between good and acceptable, but there was slow combat movements and clearly tacky, but they are made good enough to be viewed, and this is a major weakness in the film, which is classified as action and speed.
The acting performance is good in addition to the script. None of them are distinguished.The film in general is good for those who love action, but without expectations of escalating events, the level of the film as a whole is average, so expectations remain medium."
406,"Movie for the most ok, but wow, what a lousy intro and the soundtrack throughout is almost unbearable . . Something needs to give. And this time it was almost me. I am not usually picky, but this just came across so cheesy and cheap."
407,Mountain of gun violence from Hollywood. What hypocrisy!
408,"A former addict with family issues returns home after disappearing for years to become a hit man/woman. Her sister now lives with her ex, and her mum seems to hate her. Then for no reason at all, her employers decide to try to kill her... It's all done badly and the story is a mess... Characters seem to disappear, others don't serve any purpose, the story... Well... it actually has no story, it just has a series of scenes with a backstory to the to guide the viewer through them... The action is just as bad as the acting too... Yuck."
409,The only reason why I even watched was because it starred Malkovich in it.
410,"Action category ""B"", the plot is hackneyed, but it is ok for one time watching."
411,"One problem with this film is Chastain, though a good actor, is no action hero. She can play super powered Dark Phoenix though in this film she is trading punches with Colin Farrell and so such, very implausible.Amazing cast but unoriginal plot, guess these guys are bored of this lock down and would take any role. The plot and script are more of a Scott Adkins caliber rather than these good actors."
412,"Jessica Chastain is good, as is John Malkovich, but everyone else is mediocre and the storyline is clich√© filled and full of absurdities.
I enjoyed the fight scenes, and the first 30 minutes or so were really promising, but the family drama was overdone and didn't contribute in a meaningful way. Not the worst film I've seen, but not one I'd recommend."
413,"It sounds like, looks like John Wick female version. But it is not.
It is easy to predict the plot, fight action is OK but not great.
Too much drama, not enough action. Not really likeable characters."
414,"A solid telemovie. That's what this felt like. Lacked the polish or a Bourne or Bond or Amazons Hanna for that matter.
Not Jessica Chastains best work either."
415,"The initial action sequence was great, so I thought yes, this is going to be good, unfortunately that was the highlight. The Acting was fine, but in general it lacked something. An okay movie with a good cast that lost its way along the subplots. Only Adequate."
416,"I love films with spunky, female action babes but this tries to cast an aging actress housed in a dumpy mom-bod as a CIA assassin, lethally adept with weapons as well as with her hands. If that's not bad enough, they injected some kind of Lifetime movie storyline that seemed to be a completely different film, into a film featuring assassinations, and CIA intrigue. And if THAT'S not bad enough, they decided to give the lead (and her sister) a pointless interracial relationship, ugh."
417,"Jessica Chastain is probably ma favorite actress, saw pretty much all her movies. ""Ava"" isn't one of the good ones. The narrative is shallow and underdevelopped. I liked the intensity of some scenes and the effort to create something raw, but they missed the point."
418,Was Chastain believable with the physical fighting? She took out a lot of guys phyiscally and she looks so slight. Did they have to give so much screen time to the family issue thing? None of the family she had was likeable or relevant to the story. The sister Judy (Jess Weixler) was horrid and the love interest triangle with (Michael) Common was contrived and he is too wooden. Geena Davis as the mom was cranky and spent 5 minutes of the film playing cards with Ava and knocking the table. Why was ex alcoholic Ava able after a off the wagon drinking binge able to defeat fellow trained assassin Simon (Colin Farrell) and why did he just give up and walk away after fighting her for ten minutes only to be shot down in the street hobbling away? Why did Ava smoke so much in the first 10 minutes of the movie then nothing for the rest of the movie? Why does John Malkovich (Duke) sound the same every movie he makes? He is very monotone. I think this could have leant more toward the assassin side than the domestic. Would have been a better result. Not terrible though. Lots of famous faces.
419,"Ava is the newest action picture starring Jessica Chastain (Zero Dark thirty, A History of Violence). Chastain is a very capable actress, especially in dramatic roles. Ava, however, is a role that doesn't suit her. It's a role that involves fighting and many cold looks and a certain amount of toughness (I am thinking about Charlize Theron in Atomic Blonde or the Old Guard) that Chastain simply doesn't have.
Ava is an assassin that, we are told early in the movie, has battled with addiction to alcohol and pills. This backstory would be interesting if it had any impact on the movie's events. Let me give you a quick insight.
The movie starts with Ava picking up a target and after having a friendly chat she climbs in the back seat and has a friendly conversation with him before she kills him. She asks him why someone wants him dead. This comes up a lot in the movie but it is never clear why Ava wants to know. The whole sequence takes about ten minutes and is extremely uncomfortable to watch. Mainly because Chastain doesn't look comfortable. She doesn't look cool and calculating and heartless but rather confused and a little unsure and trust me that's not the character.
After Ava gets rid of the body she meets her handler Duke (John Malkovich, giving his best to a thankless and flat character).
We can deduce that Duke and Ava have more than a professional relationship. They're more like father ran daughter.
Duke gives Ava her next job where everything goes wrong and she has to run from the people hiring her.
I will stop with the plot here but trust me it doesn't get better.
Duke's boss Simon (Colin Farrell) is such a flat and unexciting character that I wonder how he made it so high in the organization. Farrell is a very capable actor and he tries to make the most of Simon's shallow character. I can't help but wonder if it would haven't have been a better movie with Farrell's and Malkovich's roles reversed.
Over the course of the movie, Ava has many scenes with her family, and part of her backstory is revealed. But rather than doing this through flashbacks, there is a very boring monologue held by Chastain about what happened to her character. Even more confusing is that her ex-fiance is now engaged to Ava's sister. In fact there are so many issues Ava has to clear up with her family that it feels more like an episode of This is Us than a spy thriller.
The whole first half of the movie has about one exciting scene, which in my opinion is way too short. It's a scene where Ava has to fight her way out of a hotel after she is being chased by a horde of bad guys.
And while this is a very exciting scene and the fight scenes in general are the best part of the movie, we can see that they are staged.
If you look closely you can see the actors react to a punch before it even happens and in instance, jumping out of the way, a long time before something is thrown at them.
In a movie like this, I expected a big showdown or a big twist that changes the whole perspective. Something that would make the whole affair a little more exciting and at least give us a thrilling ending. Instead what we get is a boring and predictable finish, that makes the whole movie even worse.
The only grace in the movie is John Malkovich. His usual calm and calculating demeanor is the best thing about the movie. His character, like all the others, is underwritten. Malkovich makes the best of it and he actually does a decent job. He has the rare talent to change his demeanor from sincere to threatening in a millisecond which really helps his character.
All in all, I can say that Ava is a movie that boasts with it's star power and then lets them fall flat.
I can only advise you that when the movie comes to theaters in September, save your money and go spent it on something nice or maybe another better movie."
420,"Found the directing to be something out of B movies, and the story was over the top.The characters were not convincing, the fighting was so fake and bad.The plot was being made up on the spot I think..Don't bother"
421,Fir 20 min of frist time move be good but the last part of movie not good and prefect and end is very bad
422,"As much as I like Jessica Chastain, this was painful to watch. Someone tried to jump into the ""powerful"" feminist assassin bandwagon alas John Wick, but failed miserably. The story is absurd. The plot is full of holes and predictable. From the first scenes you can't believe Chastain's character is what they are trying to sell us. She doesn't have the physique, the dexterity and the technique to be a full metal assassin. It's just unbelievable. Even her acting is sub par. The lame and slow choreography of the fight scenes makes things even worse. Big names like Malcovich or Davies just got onboard to cash their much need covid-relief check. This is a lousy movie. It's a bad copy of a copy of a copy. Makes John Wick (which is mediocre at best) look like a Scorcese film. Ava could end up being 2020's worst. Stay away. Or maybe just watch it to see how bad cinema can be."
423,"I'd like to know whether Jessica Chastain is even more tone-deaf than I imagined - or just extraordinary incompetent at vetting? I mean, his numerous crimes have been all over his Wikipedia page for years. I also want to know what the thoughts/conversations were like during the backlash and Newton's subsequent exit."
424,"There is, what I believe to be intentional, a side of weakness to a person in control and in charge. Sadly, I felt it took away from the character and the development of the plot.Also, the interactions that should matter are mostly bad. Most of the cast has a weird delivery to their lines, and I might like to blame the direction instead of them.. Well, maybe not Common's, whose way of talking felt childlike in a way I never noticed before (he is a rapper or something? Will pay attention to his next role). Aside from mostly everyone, Geena Davis (mother) sells her scene perfectly. For a moment, her dry and no-waste interactions with her daughter made me believe Chastain was who she said she was (even though it makes no sense really).Instead of a Spy-Killer movie, you get more of a drama.. and it doesn't really sell it."
