It was beautiful, clean and added a bit of magic & belief which is what we all need this Christmas. Wonderfully over the top - I highly recommend watching!!"
1,"Some people just have to spew hate but don't believe them. This is a WONDERFUL ADDITION to my list of 'watch every year' holiday movies with LOVELY ORIGINAL MUSIC and fun dancing. The cast's musical talent is off the charts and I love that it shows little girls as brilliant,
and mathematical. I am so happy for my two young grand-daughters to have Journey to identify with."
2,"What a magical movie!!! The colors!! The costumes!!! The singing!!! The sets!!!! The magic!!! It's a cross between The Wiz and Greatest Showman. I enjoyed every minute and will surely watch Jingle Jangle every Christmas holiday going forward right alongside Polar Express and Elf.Jingle Jangle is such a pure, heartfelt movie. You will enjoy it."
3,"What a great Christmas musical comedy!! Filled with great performances, songs, characters, cinematography and direction. Definitely worth a look!!Tim Treakle"
4,"I am a sucker for a good Christmas film, and a good underdog story. This one hit all the right notes. Yes, there are tooth-achingly cheesy moments-what would a good Christmas film be without those? But more importantly, when this movie hits your heartstrings, it really hits HOME. I was sobbing in the best, happy-cry way at multiple points, and when everything ties up with a bow at the end, it feels so truly well-earned. This captures the real meaning of Christmas-it's definitely going on the once-a-year Christmas film rotation."
5,"Such a magical uplifting Christmas movie. Music elements make it even better.
Just what is needed at this special time of year. Great cast, great acting, lovely story, great music, brilliant dancing and that extra touch of magic."
6,"I just adored this movie from start to finish. I'm a huge fan of stage musicals and this definitely gave me a stage-musical feel all the way. The story's very heart-warming and I the message in it is even better - nothing's impossible when you believe it can be done. We lose so much of this feeling when we grow up that we most often lose our way and this clearly demonstrated this belief. Back to the film though - the sets were absolutely breath-taking, the music was fantastic and uplifting, the singing was truly awesome and the dancing was exceptional - the cast was fabulous too - it was a breath of fresh air to see such a fabulously diverse cast.Overall, this is one movie that will remain a favourite of mine for years and years to come <3"
7,"This movie was Black Girl Magic, Black is King, and melanin greatness. It was beautiful, funny, heartwarming, magical, and colorful. The soundtrack alone is a whole mood. Little Black girls and boys can watch this movie and see themselves in Journey and Edison and let their imaginations run. I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
8,"Far beyond the usual Netflix Hallmark-style Christmas films, this one is high budget and very well produced. The musical numbers are fantastic and the costume design is marvellous. It's a tad cheesy and more than a little absurd, but the plot is solid and it's very charming."
9,"IN A NUTSHELL:
This jubilant movie is a breath of fresh air. If you love musicals, you'll love this. If you don't, step away. It feels like a colorful Broadway stage play but it's even better because of the magic of technology and filmmaking. The movie was written and directed by David E. Talbert featuring a mostly African-American cast. It's not the typical Christmas show, but it will definitely get you in the mood for magic and wonder. Thank you to Netflix for saving 2020 with all of the awesome content this year and for inviting me to screen this movie early!TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This is entirely family-friendly entertainment. Yay!
Little girls, especially, are going to love this.
When your kids have a hard time with math, just remind them about the ""square root of possible.""THEMES:
""We wait for no tomorrows!"" - Don Juan Diego (Ricky Martin)
""The square root of impossible is the possible in me!"" - Journey ( Madalen Mills)
Obstacles
Possibilities
Be who you're meant to be
""If you believe, it's all possible."" - Grandmother (Phylicia Rashad)THINGS I LIKED:
The musical score by John Debney is spirited with fun variety. I don't know if little girls around the world will stop singing songs from Frozen 2 but these songs are really sweet. Every singer in the cast blew my socks off. The songs perfectly fit the scenes and feel like they belong to the story.
The lively singing and energetic dancing are delightful. It reminded me of the joyful movie The Greatest Showman , which is quite a compliment because I absolutely love that movie.
The talented cast includes charismatic performances by Forest Whitaker, Keegan-Michael Key, Hugh Bonneville, Phylicia Rashad, Justin Cornwell, Anika Noni Rose, and even Ricky Martin!
Madalen Mills is absolutely adorable and fantastic. Her voice is pure and she's definitely got some acting chops that will surely grant her a great future in films. Do I smell Disney in her future?
Who else wants Phylicia Rashad to be their grandmother? Yes, please.
I thought the toy matador was so fun and I wanted to see more of him. He's voiced by none other than Ricky Martin!
I love how the live-action movie was intertwined with animation.
There is a cute snowball fight scene that used local business owners and shops as Extras in Norwich, England where the scene was filmed.
Charming set design and production.
I didn't know Keegan-Michael Key or Forest Whitaker could sing! Wow! Nice! Forest Whitaker actually sings three times!
John Legend recorded the song ""This song"" and stated, ""As a father, I jumped at the chance to be involved with a holiday film that's both inspirational and inclusive, a film with a great message where my kids can see themselves reflected on the screen."" He wrote some of the other songs and produced the film as well.
Some really great CGI.
The costume design by Michael Wilkinson is extremely vibrant and detailed with fun touches.
Keep watching during the closing credits for some more cute images that match the job titles of the crew.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The lips don't always quite match the singing. All of the songs are good but they're not all memorable.
Some cheesy, overacted, cliched moments.
It's hard to tell where the story is supposed to take place...USA? Europe? England?
The new toy toward the end of the movie looks an awful lot like Wall-E.
There are a LOT of plots crammed into the story.FUNNY LINES:
* ""You can throw roses at my feet later."" - Don Juan Diego (Ricky Martin)""Ok, back to me!"" - Don Juan Diego (Ricky Martin)
""Well, you hurry back as slowly as you can."" - (Forest Whitaker)INTERESTING LINES:
""It's not stealing when you borrow indefinitely."" - Don Juan Diego (Ricky Martin)
""What makes you think you can get it work?"" - Edison Latimer (Kieron Dyer) ""Because there's nothing that says I can't."" - Journey (Madalen Mills)
""The magic isn't just in what you've lost. It's in what you still have."" - Ms. Johnston (Lisa Davina Phillip)
""A child with an imagination always belongs."" - Jeronicus (Forest Whitaker
""Never be afraid of what you can see. Only be afraid if you no longer see it."" - Jeronicus (Forest Whitaker)You can see the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel and website"
10,"This is a wonderful movie that everyone should watch! My two-year-old even loved it. It has great music, singing, dancing and acting. I could say more but just view it for yourself."
11,I love this movie!! So much Christmas magic and a beautiful story!! Yes i cried too
12,"I enjoyed this musical so much! I didn't know it was a musical but when they started to sing, the voices were so good ! Such a cute story reminding me of Neverending Story or The Princess Bride. The sets and costuming were top rate and of course Forrest Whitaker and P. Rashad! I love her sweet smile! Forrest is SUCH a great actor! Thanks everyone!"
13,"The diversity and talent of the cast and dancers, in combination with stunning production design, original animated transitions and world-building make Jingle Jangle the Christmas musical-fantasy classic unlike any other. Wow, David E. Talbert, wow."
14,"Amazing cast, visually stunning, & a unique story. It was a little long at 2 hours, but would absolutely recommend to others. A solid choice to add to your holiday line up each year."
15,"This was incredible! The story was so good, whether you're a kid or adult. Ignore what others say about trying too hard."
16,"Looks amazing, sounds fantastic; and the costumes are nothing short of glorious. But this film needs to head back to the cutting room and loose about 30 minutes.with John Legend as producer, it's no surprise that the voices are impressive. The musical numbers and choreography top notch.The combination of digital animation and live action is seamless.But this film feels heavy and by the end of it, we were carrying kids to bed."
17,"Great story line. Great actors. Beautiful staging with eye popping colors. Amazing singing and wonderful songs. Broadway on TV! I loved it. Not quite a Christmas movie, but What a great way to start the holiday season."
18,"Absolutely wonderful Christmas movie. The costumes and sets are just stunning, brilliant actors and singing, the songs and choreography catchy and entertaining without being cheesy. Lovely cosy colourful movie to watch at any age."
19,"Very entertaining, high energy choreography , great dramatics, well designed costumes and soulful. I loved Miles and Miles by Marshida it was inspiring and uplifting as the movie. I have watched it ten times so far.😂"
20,This is a true authentic Christmas family movie!! I was captivated by the amazing cast. It was magically and now it will be a classic for my family!
21,"LOVED THIS MOVIE!
I just adored this movie from start to finish. I'm a huge fan of stage musicals and this definitely gave me a stage-musical feel all the way. The story's very heart-warming and I the message in it is even better - nothing's impossible when you believe it can be done.

22,Such an incredible feel good movie. Incredible costume designs. Great music. Forrest Whitaker does such a great solo performance and truly performs the sorrow of his character. The little girl is a true star in the marking with a beautiful voice.
23,Every moment of this movie was incredibly enjoyable to watch. From the set to the costumes and the wonderful actors. I had a smile on my face the entire time.
24,"I'm not a fan of musicals, but I can give 10 stars if done right, like Frozen. On the plus side, this one does have the best sets I've seen in a long time and Forest Whitaker does a great job with his character. But the dialog and story are very weak and the songs are not inspiring at all. If I had it to do over again I'd skip this movie."
25,Truly inspirational and amazing to watch! Definitely worth watching.
26,"Children and most adults will probably love this film. It's got everything but in my opinion a little too much of everything. If you enjoy the greatest showman then you will recognize the similar music and choreography right off the bat. For me this movie is way too sugary, over the top and cliche without any real sincerity."
27,"The music, the theatrics, the dancing, the colors, and THE VOICES! WOW! It made my heart happy and we need that with everything going on. I'm sure I will watch it multiple times during this holiday season with family and friends. #MochaHolidays #JingleJangle #HolidayMagic"
28,"Beautiful movie, great actors, my little girls recommend it..."
29,"It looks pretty and feels magical, but thats about it. The movie seems to want to check to many boxes at once and ends up forgetting to do the most important thing: be a good story. The story is rushed and not unique, the personalities feel completely fabricated and dialogs unrealistic. This movie is probably fun for very young children, but thats about it"
30,"Feels like netflix wanted a bunch of things in this movie, but this resulted in little time for each keyword. There was no time appreciating any relationship and decisions. When the characters lack motivation and logic as well the movie becomes lackluster."
31,It's not horrible but definitely passable. The story line is just so predictable and familiar like bits of other movies were pieces together for this one. Definitely not Forrest Whitaker's best performance but some actors were fairly good. Also some weird parts that didn't quite fit or provide much to the story.
32,"One of the worst if not the worst Christmas movie I've ever seen. The disappointment is proportional to the size of the production, what a huge waste of resources. Photography and costumes are the only things I save. The story is terrible. The characters are a bunch of stereotypes put together randomly and the soundtrack is the pinnacle of bad taste for a Christmas movie. I am very surprised to read so many positive comments."
33,"What a lovely, charming Christmas movie. Journey is just fantastic. Watch by yourself, with the kids or grandkids. You'll be glad you did."
34,"The robot 'Buddy' was treated with E.T level importance, the kids just MUST risk their lives to retrieve it, which would be fine were it not for the fact the kids spent only one (very) short scene engaging with it. There was never a connection formed for the kids (or the audience) to really care whether the robot would be saved, or would be repaired. By the same token the inventor and his love interest shared only one musical number together in the beginning, and then were apart for the rest of the film, and so once again it was very hard to care if they would end up back together.Only upside to the film is the musical numbers (great dancing, great visuals). Skip the rest of the film (it drags), and just watch those segments on youtube or something."
35,This is an instant Christmas classic!! There's amazing music and costumes and CGI and -Christmas magic!!
36,"I was surprised at how good this movie/musical was. In a world of remakes it was good to see a new storyline. The music, the costumes, the settings, the actors...all amazing. I hope this makes it to DVD so I can add it to my collection."
37,"This Movie/Musical is incomparable and is certainly not your average film. ""Jingle Jangle"" will wow you in multiple ways. The storyline and plot are amazing and will keep you glued to the tube. The cast is hand-picked and made each part believable; especially the newby, little Miss Madelin Mills ... who plays the part of Journey Jangle. Her charisma is magnetic. WHO IS SHE AND WHERE DID SHE COME FROM? We'd like to see more of her.The music is electrifying and makes you mumble the lyrics even if you don't know the music pieces. The vocal choices displayed in each song were unpredictable and more inviting than your traditional Broadway musical. This movie is sure to get rave reviews. A MUST SEE! A MUST RE-SEE!"
38,"Where do I start. Bad acting, must have used most of the budget on Forrest Whittaker. The songs were out of context for the moment, completely forced with lyrics that were nonsense. The plot is ok, but some if it just doesnt make sense. Its about an hour too long, its padded out terrible songs and scenes which are completely pointless offering nothing to the story."
39,"I watched this with my children last night and we loved it. The visuals and design are stunning and well thought out. The music was catchy, uplifting and beautifully sung. The choreography made you want to get up and dance. As an adult who has watched lots of Christmas films there's always similar themes that you can pick up on but I think that's part of a Christmas film is recognising that hope, joy, faith and belief are usually going to be a part of it. The animated parts were amazing as well and then on top of all of that, the representation made my heart swell. My child even said ""look she has skin like my skin"" as he stared at the screen with pure wonderment. This is definitely a new holiday classic for us."
40,"FIRST let's get the thorny issue out of the way: People are saying this is a racial story or a black story. If that's the first thing you noticed, you may need to reassess *why* you noticed that so much. Yes, the lead characters *happen* to look African by heritage (ethnic traits do tend to pass down from same-ethnicity parents!) but I detected no agenda beyond the rather tautological message that self-belief is the key to -erm- self-belief!
Now for the actual review. Visually it's gorgeous, but so sweet I sometimes felt queasy. Here's my problem, it looked like an archetypal Christmas film, but did not feel like one. That story could have happened at any time of the year. It was a dull predictable story too - the plot actually had not one single 'I didn't see THAT coming' moment. That's probably still entertaining if your actual or emotional age is still in single figures, but, if you've been around a bit longer, you may come away jadedly disappointed at how little life-affirmation it gave you.
It promised to be so much more from the trailer, but I just didn't really accept the characters as real. They were each introduced with formulaic clues as to their inner psyches... then those psyches were never explored. Given that it was over-long for a children's film, they could have found opportunities. Instead we were assaulted with 'uplifting' Disney-style power ballads, but few real emotional interactions. Even there, half the time they weren't even singing *with* or *to* anyone. The songs certainly showboated some powerful voices, but had lyrics that were inane and did not even properly rhyme. I had forgotten every one as soon as the film ended. Sadly the songs also highlighted that though Mr Witaker has many talents, in comparison to the other singers, singing is not his strongest.
Without giving away the plot: I came away annoyed that character A clearly under-valued character B, which turned B bad, and then character A was never called to recognise they were actually responsible for creating their own antagonist. Including that one confrontation, admission and reconciliation in the story would have raised the dramatic effect and pathos enormously.
My favourite bit, seriously, was recognising one of the location shoots as a place I know!
In short, it was ok for a bit of fun - a funked-up Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium if you will - but I wouldn't watch it again next Christmas, or ever."
41,"Don't believe user review who give rating 10
It's really bad move."
42,"I am a huge Christmas movie watcher, and this may be one of the best I've seen lately. The story is original and heartwarming. The characters are immersive with wonderful actors. The costumes and sets amazing!!! Every scene is a delight for the eyes. The songs are so powerful. This movie is for children and adults, and should be shared together. Whoever put this together, thank you!!! This put more happiness and holiday cheer in my heart than any movie in years 💖"
43,"The story was fantastic, it had everything within it to be great: good storyline, stellar cast, Broadway vibe. Just everything was too much. Over acting, over singing, over trying.
It's good, but not a must watch, and not a watch again"
44,Such a fun holiday movie!! I normally fall asleep during kids movies but I was awake the whole time loved all the songs and the feel good spirit!!
45,This is a jumble of movies you've already seen. It's Wonder Imporium meets short circuit meets Christmas carol meets polar express. It has beautiful sets and a good cast but it's just a thrown together fruitcake of played out themes.
46,"It's a musical but doesn't know about it.child actors disaster.
target; broadway
result; disney channel.
I would like to write at length, but you get tired just reading. Netflix Christmas/Noel/New Year productions are getting worse every year."
47,"So the positives.
General idea and story telling ok. Not really an original idea as it has a load of influences.
You can clearly see the main influence is the Greatest showman.
Easy watch that require you to put little effort into watching to understand what's going on. Some kids will enjoy it but I think they'll get bored quite fast.Songs. loads and loads of songs A bit too much. Nearly every scene has one. Over acting over singing over everything.Critics will love it due to its diverse cast but I don't rate films that kind of way.I like forest Whitaker and Keegan-Michael Key performances.
4 stars."
48,"If you're looking for super deep plot twists and layered story telling then no, you won't find it here.
Jingle Jangle may try to cram as much festive cheer into the 2 hour run time as I do with pigs in blankets at Christmas dinner but that doesn't take anything away from the vibe of this film.Beautiful set design, costumes, cinematography, choreography accompanied by a high end soundtrack by some of the industries' highest award winning creatives gives us a real treat on the eyes and ears.I'm not into musicals at all but even I couldn't help but get swept up in this little gem of a Christmas musical, nodding my head and tapping my feet to the non-traditional songs we've become accustomed to with typically 'white Christmas' films.After all of the misery that 2020 has brought to so many, Jingle Jangle is the perfect remedy to put on and forget, even for 2 hours, everything else and feel all warm and fuzzy.Does it have flaws? Of course. Does it matter in a festive kids musical? No.Also, Forest Whitaker's performance should not go unnoticed as he proves he is still very much worthy of being the lead actor. Couldn't help but choke up at times (no spoilers here) and who knew he could deliver when it comes to dropping a tune. He should do it more.
Madalen Mills also destined to become a superstar.Take it for how it was intended and you will love it!"
49,The Movie is a real disaster. I could not understand what was going on in the entire movie ! The acting skills were average. It is a real time slayer.
50,"Ignore the bigots this is not a film about race and not should it be discussed as one, it is simply a delight! Magical and full of charm please watch it it's a real treat"
51,"They're boys, so generally immune to musicals, or so I thought. But they watched every minute of this spectacular holiday movie. A treat for every single sense, eye popping colours, award worthy costumes, and what incredible voices! We all loved every minute and this will become a holiday favourite. Witty dialogue, sweet messaging, what's not to love? Thanks for creating a movie for the entire family, albeit Granny is now inundated with requests for a Buddy robot..."
52,"I'm not a big musical movie lover, but this movie took me so many places. I laughed, I cried, I got goosebumps.... I was taken back to childhood feelings of love, imagination, excitement, hope and wonder. It was absolutely heart felt and I can't wait to add it to my family movie library."
53,This is the type of movie I watched growing up. Its awesome Netflix and the producers and writer are showing quality diverse stories with the magic we all love. This movie made me smile all over to know that children will see themselves in the characters. This is just what I wanted it to be. I loved it.
54,It's escapism for your eyes and soul. Costumes are rich and colourful. Singing and dancing is on song. The actors are great.If you want something to lift your spirits. Then watch. It's really fun.
55,"Awesome movie! The story's very heart-warming and I the message in it is even better - nothing's impossible when you believe it can be done. The costumes are beautiful, vibrant, and imaginative! Loved the dancing and well written songs! Do yourself a favor and believe in magic while you watch this movie! Love love love this movie! Funny, fun, imaginative!"
56,"I'll admit that once I realized that it was a musical watching the trailer I lost interest but wanted to put something for my 6 year old daughter that was ""Christmasy"" ....I was immediately HOOKED!!! The story is just magical! The songs truly catch you where I found myself wanting to sing along, the costumes and the set...everything just comes together so beautifully!! The actors did qn amazing job especially little Journey and it really captures the heart of Christmas and the joy we all need this time of year especially during this past pandemic and 2020 being well..not the best. I will definitely rewatch again with the whole family and make it a holiday tradition to watch every year. Thank you Netflix for this wonderful and magical movie!!! Now I feel like watching The Greatest Showman 😆❤🎄** I'm glad I chose this movie for my first review **"
57,"I watched this earlier and was amazed
It's such a good film deffinatly in my top 5 , I really strongly recommend it"
58,Great feel good family movie!!! We absolutely loved the songs and wardrobe. Beautifully done
59,"I watched this movie with my husband and we both were touched, enlightened, entertained, dared to dream and felt every emotion we felt watching Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer! For a few hours, we were able to forget politics, covid-19 and everything disheartening! This musical was jazzy, cultural, diverse and everything a holiday movie should be!!!!"
60,"A Christmas movie that will certainly go down in history, this movie was a delight from one spell-binding scene to the next.Great acting, singing, and dancing - with colorful period pieces and costumes, this is a must, must see for the holidays.A delightful cast and a fantastique story line, a classic and more makes this the first place movie of the season. It nudges out all competition.You'll watch it again and again; not just during every holiday season - but as soon as it ends, you'll want to turn around and watch it again!"
61,"It's hilarious to me to read the reviews and see people saying this is ""overally racial""??? I think this was a breath of fresh air after everything that's been happening this year, specifically the stupid race war. The one or two films that they have under they're belt compared to the MILLIONS of predominantly white films? Yeah I've seen those movies before this was something different!
Hahah what a joke people are. It's sickening that people watch a movie and the first thought that comes to mind is RACE!!Anyways my one con on this would be timing and singing other then that outstanding Christmas movie. Great start to our families Christmas movie night."
62,"A modern day classic that belongs right up there with it's a wonderful life and Christmas story .
10s across the board on everything, we needed this right here and now .
All those nasty negative reviews are coming from ....let's just say the same people who voted for Trump ( . U guys should be ashamed of yourselves and let all the hate go ."
63,This is not your typical Christmas movie and in a good way!
64,"Sets, costumes, singing and acting is wonderfully magical. Well worth your time! Definitely one of our new family favorites!"
65,"In these bleak times Jingle Jangle is the musical salve we could all use! Fantastically bright sets, rousing songs, wonderful dancing, and a whole lot of heart from these characters who may be new but immediately feel familiar and warm. The amazing children, especially Madalen Mills, definitely drive the show; but Forest Whittaker is achingly endearing and Keegan Michael-Key is delightfully warped. Please keep making more movies like this, where we get to see diverse casts, centered on stories of their lives. Representation matters so we can show our kids the full hearts and souls of all people."
66,"I'm not usually one for Christmas Movies but this one is great! Great story, awesome acting and who knew Forest Whitaker could sing like that? I highly recommend it for the whole family."
67,Such a well done story with great music and super fun characters! I loved the costumes! The story was so well told and the acting was perfect. Nice job! We will watch it every year. I love the holidays.
68,"Magical! Brilliant! Heartwarming! Spectacular! This movie is an instant classic. An amazing cast! The set was fantastic, the acting, music and choreography was superb. I haven't watched an entire holiday show in years, I didn't miss a minute of Jingle Jangle."
69,What a beautiful movie with fantastic music. The characters have layers which makes the movie all the more enjoyable.
70,"What a beautiful movie that's so fun and heartfelt. There are some out there fantasy moments, but it's a family holiday movie! My kids absolutely loved it - they joyfully danced along to the songs. The characters are so great, especially Mrs Johnston, the postal worker. The representation is so great - both for communities of color and smart, brave female characters. This is going to be in our annual Christmas movie rotation. Highly recommended."
71,Absolutely adored it! Music was amazing as well as the dancing!!!!! One of the nicest Christmas movies ever!
72,"This is a Christmas film I will definitely be adding to the holiday line up. It's really good with stellar cast, great animation and visuals for this especially Christmas season. Don't believe the low criticism saying it's a waste of time. If you have the feeling of imagination and Christmas spirit you'll like the film."
73,"I'm not sure why there are comments about this being too long. Have you timed the Nutcracker or the Christmas story? Your kids can watch this in the afternoon and be amazed. It's Broadway, it's the Sound of Music, it's a family story for all ages and perfect for a moment of pleasure in a year so full of crazy! Finally a welcome addition to 2020."
74,"Great film. We'll be watching this again.
Didn't pick up any songs that stuck. But my kids absolutely loved it."
75,"This movie has heart. It was suggested by a friend and I thought it'd just be another one of those cutesy familyfmusicals... but by the end... I was crying. Forest Whitaker is just amazing, and you might not think the story is all that great, but at the end, you realize how great it is. It's a movie about losing hope, giving up, and coming back from that. Really just give it a chance."
76,"Beautiful costumes and settings, amazing dancing, singing and a great story which kept you guessing. Exactly the sort of film I want to watch at Christmas, and would happily watch it every Christmas from now on!"
77,Jingle Jungle and all that staff in title was a fun time for most of runtime and i think that young kids could enjoy this film and had a fun time with it.Characters are wacky and over the top but for this kind of films it works rather well and such things made this film even better.The best part was Key who was scene stealer here and his character had everything that he needed to have and he accepted that with a pride.Whitaker and rest of cast were also good and kids for the most of film did a good job.Runtime is perhaps little to long and it starts to drag in scenes but still in end this is cool kids film
78,"I absolutely loved this movie. I am sort of neutral when it comes to live action musicals but the musical performances in this movie were fantastic and the music was beautiful. The background was a perfect fit. The acting was top notch with a very likeable cast. The only reason I didn't give it an outright 10 is because I felt part of the story was missing, specifically the part about the daughter. I sort of wanted to know what happened to her during her absence but I used my imagination!"
79,Adored this Movie. I rmbr wen David E Talbert used to Produce Plays. Your work is Outstanding from the Cast to the Musical numbers and Dance. God Bless You🌹
80,"Tis the season for new movies... at least it used to be before the virus hit. What normally would be a busy Friday night has turned into scarce pickings over streaming and trying to keep up with the idea of specials that these sites are loading out. Tonight though, I managed to catch the early seasonal film, an attempt to get a Christmas spirit going in hopes your little ones will catch the magic of the holidays. So, what do I think of the latest direct to stream film? Please read on to hear my thoughts as I review.

The Lack of Suspense
The Story is Weak AT a lot of parts
Too In your Face/PreachySummary:I give Talbert and his crew props for crafting a tale that feels much like a children's novel meant to inspire and ignite the dreams of the young. Jingle Jangle is a movie with all the trimmings and charm that feels like it came out of Disney or Nick Jr. studios. Very little darkness, very little dismay, the diluted hard knock lives only act as a means to ignite the spark of hope that this movie carries with it. The inspiration of hope, creativity, and belief are strong messages in this film and you can be sure those who love their Hallmark and young adult films will get caught up in the aura this movie unleashes.
In regards to the manner it tells this story, that is my favorite part at this stage of my life and where I think the movie does things quite well. Costumes bring you into the Christmas Story vibe as a much more ethnically mixed cast shows off the designs and brings you into world Talbert wants to build. Settings using stage pieces and CGI take that journey one step forward, but mixing in a bit of fantasy clockwork that the Nutcracker made a few years ago that is intriguing to see. Regardless the world building is rather impressive, and other movies can be seen as the inspiration for the direction they chose. Amidst the different acts, a nice telling using clockwork robots is used to fill in the interluding space, again capturing the charm of a Christmas specialty shop I visited when I was younger. It's a nice twist in style that I appreciate, though maybe it did get a tad overused.. However, the real wow factor for this movie's presentation is the songs that come with it. While not as diverse, Jingle Jangle's soundtrack reminded me much of The Greatest Showman. Wailing orchestral music combines with hip hop, funk, and classical to make a toe tapping ordeal with numbers that are both motivating to get up and dance and also emotionally layered as well. The opening number in particular was one of my favorites, and a middle number as well hit the spot, while others serve to be whacky and entertaining for all ages. Like many of the modern day musicals, lots of time and resources went into this element, and I believe some story sacrifices were seen to load the 2 hours with as much music as possible. If that's your angle, this movie should be number one on your spot this weekend, if not, well read on to hear my limitations with the film.A strong opening that promised magic and a true Christmas adventure, quickly become rushed, musical numbers overshadowing the story and character development at many parts of the movie. Never did I feel this more than the opening where so much set up was cast into an interlude in order to fast forward to where our younger cast could make a splash so to speak. It seems during this rushed opening where villains and supporting characters quickly got crammed in and swept aside that the Christmas components also got lost, dropped into the pre spirit visit of Scrooge's life and not really escaping this until the very end. The movie sort of diverges from even the Christmas error, instead becoming more towards rival toymakers, greed, and some inventing components similar to Hugo meeting Wall-E's designs so to speak. Was it cute? Yes, quite adorable, but I don't know if I would call this a Christmas Journey, more than journey for self-growth near the end of the year. In addition, the suspense and challenges we see in movies (Santa on trial in Miracle on 3rth street, Home Alone's Kevin defending his home from robbers, or even the Rugrats trying to trap Santa in the chimney) were missing in this film.. A few challenges and test of character, Jingle Jangle trades real development of threat and ingenuity to solve problems for more musical numbers, feel good monologues, and kid friendly slapstick for lack of a better word. It leads to sort of a haphazard story that is a bit weak for my tastes and loses the collective picture I think we all look for in the seasonal films. And perhaps the worst of all... it feels like a sappy, political, Facebook post when trying to deliver its messages. Again inspiration, but I agree too much that it misses the mark of a truly motivational movie for another filler meant to be added to the collection of the streaming movies, but again if that speaks to you, you should have no qualms with the film.The VERDICT:Given what passes for Christmas movies these days in a world of mass produced generic films, Jingle Jangle stands out in several departments. It's got the charm and magic of a kid's imagination that the season is about, with costumes, CGI, and setting that finally took me back to my childhood. Throw in some toe tapping numbers and some cool storytelling effects and you once again add points for raising the positive factor for the season. However, the movie is again about the superficial entertainment pieces and misses the full cohesiveness that several classics have maintained from over twenty years ago. The story is nonsensical and not much of the Christmas direction it promised, and the film's pass on adventure did not quite keep me as engaged as the opening number did. Still above all else, it's going to serve as an inspiration to a number of families and given it's accessibility is perfect for a direct release at home. Given the thoughts, the ideal is for those with young families, primarily ages 3-12 who like the song and dance gimmicks and not so much about complete stories.My scores for the film are:Family/Fantasy/Musical: 7.0 (Family/musical themes)
Movie Overall: 6.0"
81,"Jingle Jangle has such a feel good factor, proper Christmassy film that all the family can enjoy. It has goodies, baddies, singing, dancing & great characters especially ""Journey"" what a wonderful little actor she made the film. It touches your heart, tears of happiness I would definitely recommend this film to anyone."
82,I enjoyed this movie with my daughter! She finally got a chance to see someone who looked like her in a Christmas film! I really liked the way that the story was all about the strength of LOVE. I will surely watch this movie again next year & for many years to come!Anderson Brown
83,Finally a colorful Holiday story that was so enjoyable and filled with the joy and magic of the holidays!!! Thank you to the WONDERFUL cast!!!! Just BELIEVE!!!
84,This movie is a treat! Excellent story. Excellent music and choreography. Great for all ages. Forrest Whitaker shines.
85,"Although, it not the typical Christmas Story, it is packed with magical wonder. Great movie. Great story. Thank you for including everyone."
86,"Recently, I took a Friday afternoon with my family to watch a Christmas movie. We were scrolling through our Netflix account when a spectacular cover with vivid colors, costumes, and steampunk aesthetics popped up in the ""recommended"" tab. Ever curious, my family decided on the title, Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey, for our evening's homemade theatre. I should note, holiday movies are one of my favorite traditions each year, so I was ecstatic about a brand-new release with a different take on the Christmas story. Released November 13, 2020, director and writer David Talbert took my family on a trip to the magical world of the fictional Jangle family. Complete with steampunk holiday magic, the story follows the famous inventions of the Jangle family toy store. Conflict arises when the antagonist steals plans for a future prosperous invention, leading to the downfall of the Jangle's fortune and toy store. Now, the fate of the Jangle's shop lies in the hands of Jeronicus Jangle's clever granddaughter, Journey. I would recommend the marvelous and sensational take on a Christmas movie because of the engaging set, magnificent musical numbers, and well turned out characters.
I was a little nervous before starting the movie as the run time caught my eyes. The entirety of Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey lasted over two hours! However, only half an hour through the film, I became hooked on the artistic settings, environment, and stop-motion and CGI animations. I felt I could feel the effort poured into the glamourous buildings and detailed costumes, all through my TV screen. Despite the steampunk mood, the state of a Christmas town was evident. The high-quality camera captured each intricate brick, beam, and snowball in each scene. Overall, Rob Cameron's colorful set design earned my respect and attention during the lengthy Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey.
The set was not the only aspect of the film to keep my concentration focused on the movie during the fantastical storyline. Music is provided by John Debney, who also contributed to numerous famous works such as Elf, The Jungle Book, and The Greatest Showman. Debney moves the tale along with tuneful numbers. One verse in, and I could tell the upcoming songs would be phenomenal. We found ourselves smiling and occasionally dancing along with the characters to upbeat music. To summarize, the music featured in the Netflix original added an enchanting element to the overall film.
Further, the cast and characters in Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey amazed me. I recognized the name Forest Whitaker, who played the inventor Jeronicus Jangle, and Lisa Davina Phillip, who captivated me with her hilarious scenes and songs. Halfway into the movie, I did become worried the story would become monotonous and crowded as more and more characters continued to be introduced. Nevertheless, the ending nicely wraps up the storyline. The actors took the plot to another level through singing and character development. Since Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey is geared towards children, I found the movie to be predictable. However, I was not let down by the loveable characters, especially one adorable CGI robot, Buddy.
In summary, I would suggest the Christmas themed musical, Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey, because of the intricate set, delightful soundtrack, and diverse characters. I would describe the film as wholesome and festive. A holiday must-see, the Netflix original left my family with wonder and joy."
87,"Quick Summary: What's the square root of impossible?! A grandmother tells a Christmas story of magic, imagination and determination to her grandkids. In this story there's a little girl, Journey, that goes on a musical adventure trying to find her place in the world. And in the process tries to reconcile her family and become an inventor. And this little actress is a POWERHOUSE!Parents should know: It's a magical new Christmas musical that's safe for pretty much every age! There are a couple of warnings I would give. The movie involves magic, and even though it's more a science skill than supernatural power- if that bugs you, you won't like the movie. There is also a fair amount of fire. And a parental death (not a spoiler- it's in the description). Check out our full parent review with discussion questions at down the hobbit hole blog. I think this one will become an annual watch for us! Such a fun and inspiring holiday movie."
88,"This was the best way to kick off the Christmas season. My family loved watching this movie last night. We loved the story, the singing and dancing. I'm so happy we started off our season with this movie. We will be watching it over and over all season every year. Thank you for the representation and the real life example of how our people have been disenfranchised. Even by our own kind. I'm glad it had a happy ending. This will be our new tradition: watching Jingle Jangle for Christmas!"
89,"Knock off version of the Greatest showman & puss and boots...but for the black community, lost interest after the first number. Seems pointed towards children with ADHD. Way too much going on to focus on any actual storyline."
90,"After reading the negative reviews, I realized the people who wrote them were looking for ways to tear it down. It is a Christmas movie, naturally a little cheesy, and what Christmas movie isn't? The music and choreography were great. The casting, while not flawless, was incredibly enjoyable. The storybook animation was stunning to look at. It would be unfair to assume that this movie was made to win best drama at the oscars. It's made to be an uplifting Christmas movie with amazing representation not seen in most blockbuster Christmas movies. Before tearing it down, maybe watch it an open mind and take it for what it is. It brings so much joy in such a garbage year and I absolutely loved it."
91,"I wanted to see a movie not a musical.
Singing is ok but the songs take to long.
Great atmosphere and sets but when i am 15min on the movie and had to listen to 2 songs that takes +-4 minutes ... Sorry i switched it off.
And the actors are over acting it would be good on a Broadway show not in a movie."
92,Omg this movie put me in a good mood! Everything was amazing! A beautiful change from all the ugliness we have endured in 2020. Definitely a must watch.
93,Amazing film...reminds you how Christmas can be magic.
94,"I have long been a fan of musicals. ""My Fair Lady"" to ""LaLaLand"" and everything in between. Holiday musicals are my favorites and ""Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey"" could not have come sooner!!!
Well written, fantastic cinematography, production design, costume design and all! Forrest Whitaker gives a remarkable performance. In a time when there's is such craziness in our world experiencing this piece of holiday magic on Netflix gives one new hope and all it requires from us is for us to believe."
95,"Okay most Christmas movies are cheesy but this movie is very entertaining and colorful. Madalen Mills (Journey) is adorable and puts on a great performance. I wasn't surprised to read the negative reviews with racial undertones. One person even said that it's unfair to make a movie that's 90% Black, really?! I guess he didn't see The Lord of the Rings, or The Wizard of Oz! Shall I compile a long list of all the White-Washed movies?! These same type of people had the same things to say about Black Panther, the haters just can't stand to see more than the token Black actor on the big screen."
96,"This is a wonderful inspirational movie 🎥 that the entire family will enjoy... The acting, storyline, music and set design was 💯.. Great Work"
97,Me and my family loved this movie. I usually don't even like musicals but this was done so well. I'm going to add this to my Christmas movie collection. I love the cast of actors & actresses. Its story about hope & belief which ppl need around this time of year.
98,"I love this movie. I love the storyline, the songs, the acting, the animation and the magic. I was delighted from beginning to end."
99,"It's a feel good christmas story!! With great sets and costumes.... But more over is the transition between animation and live acting that is spectacular... Great singing and acting, what we needed for this Christmas and all the Christmas coming. A family Christmas classic!!!"
100,I love the inclusivity and the songs are so good. Great family movie!!!
101,"So many comments have mentioned it being an all black cast, well I didn't even notice that until I read the other comments and actually its not an all black cast as Hugh Bonneville makes a slight appearance. The film promotes the message that belief and forgiveness can solve anything. Its a wonderful film with great acting (especially from Madalen Mills who plays Journey and is just 11 years old), wonderful west end stage style songs and amazing special effects. 0its the ideal movie to get comfortable on the sofa with snacks and a duvet. Well worth watching."
102,"A must watch! It's not your typical Christmas movie which makes it even more magical and special, I watched it with my family and we all loved it from start to finish. Make those cups of cocoa, grab the popcorn, snuggle up and enjoy."
103,"This magical diverse Xmas movie takes you on an adventure sprinkling affirmations of Joy, Determination and Belief throughout this wonderful Children's fantasy with exceptional musical indulgence!"
104,"The feelings we used to have from Christmas films-love, laughter and warmth-are all wrapped in this masterful movie. It feels good and the music, family and universal love was lovely and overwhelming in the best way. I loved it so much!"
105,"This film was enriched with culture! It was nice to experience such a diverse cast potrayed in a Christmas film.The music, the story was well thought out and didn't rush ; you were really able to connect with the characters as we have probably all had a Mr. Jangles in our family and certainly a Gustafson! This movie is now a part of my children and I new Tradition. Job well done.Beautiful masterpiece!"
106,This feels and looks like a made for tv rip off of the greatest showman with less memorable songs and a better script. Unfortunately the bland songs stop any momentum of storyline you wish they'd just skip to the next part. Great to see a mainly whole cast of black actors. Visuals are also excellent.
107,"The cinematography and costumes are stunning, the music is excellent, and the choreography is Broadway-caliber. And it's a story filled with magic in a fantastic, steampunk world. If you're looking for a great holiday movie that families can enjoy together that is a standout from the usual holiday fare, this is the one that 2020 needed. Jingle Jangle will be an instant classic. Absolutely loved it."
108,"Everything was delightful about this movie. The actors were strong, the songs were moving and the animation was supreme. Thankful to have a strong black Christmas movie with depth and creativity. Oh, let's not forget the costumes! I haven't felt this magical about a Christmas movie since ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas"" first came out. Thank you for such a unique creation.To be clear, the only reason people are reviewing this movie negatively is because it's made of a majority BLACK cast which should not be an issue today. Just enjoy the movie for what is it. ART."
109,"This film was not the best film ever. It wasn't the best Christmas film ever. It probably won't be 2020's best Christmas film. I'm not sure it was aiming for any of those and nor do they matter.
The story is nice, the animation is brilliant, the cast and performances all wonderful (massive kudos to the kids), the songs perfect for the film and would not be out of place on a big Broadway stage, and the ""staging"" of it (sets, lighting, costumes) all spot on.
Watch it, tap your feet along and feel good. Why would you need more?"
110,"Absolutely amazing!!!! Grab your popcorn, hot chocolate, and a blanket to enjoy a Magical Moment to start the holiday season. Absolutely Amazing!!!"
111,Got bored fell asleep no story line acting was poor watching my grass grow was more interesting.
112,"Biggest jumble of a movie since The Greatest Showman. Usually love musicals but this just isn't good. For a Christmas film, it didn't feel very festive despite the snow on the ground. Just when you started to get a bit of plot then they'd start with yet another song. Feels like a pick and mix of popular films that just don't gel. So disappointing. Oh Forrest what we're you thinking?"
113,"Watched this movie and was positively surprised by it.
A great music score, beautiful stage and scenery, great effect animation, lovely acting and an entertaining storyline. Don't really understand the negatieve reviews."
114,"The story line was great, I love that the bad guy was a little manipulated and how intelligent Journey was (she's a genius). But the movie basically started with an unearned emotional number about characters we didn't know yet and ended with a bit too much flying, that was over done. The ending also doesn't seem thought out, did those kids never look out their window and see the factory before, thats hard to believe."
115,"I like very much It's a fun story to watch. The atmosphere is beautiful,
the graphics are obviously very beautiful. During the Christmas season Make it look warm and the family in that movie is even more warm. Everything is perfect The light, color, sound, camera angles, the performances of the actors are very good. I cried very deeply. The eyes convey emotion, the tone is beautiful,
the sound is great. There are animations to enjoy, From start to finish. In the end, the family was reunited like them, I recommend this movie this Christmas, watch this movie with my family, it will be very happy."
116,"Very entertaining. Loved the music, loved the color, loved the story. I don't know why it's pg versus g though. Very clean film. No language, the worst of it is a woman trying to com e on to a man, and that's not even that bad. I felt very comfortable with my young kids. All boys, and they all enjoyed it! Would recommend everyone who loved Roger and Hammerstein's Cinderella (musical with brandy) and the greatest showman watch this as well!"
117,Feel good positive movie 2020 needed this! The stardom cast reminds you clean is never a thing of the past.
118,"Of course we've seen the plot before but who cares, the music, singing, dancing and acting was great. I will definitely be rewatching again and again."
119,"This is what 2020 needed. We've been desperately waiting for Christmas chronicles 2 to be released and had no idea this was even in the works. It appeared on Netflix so we gave it a shot and it's brilliant. It's fun, magical and superbly directed. My kids have started watching it again!!! Can't wait to see what the director comes up with next."
120,"Awful script, badly acted, silly songs. This movie is such a horrible mess that I feel embarrassed for the whole production. Money doesn't make a film good. Netflix placed another bad movie in their hall of shame."
121,"I happened to be walking through Norwich when I saw this being filmed in Tombland.. (It really does look like that) I saw the streets covered in snow, and the snowball fight being played out.I didn't expect much, but it looked fun... Have to say, It was enjoyable to watch. Visually stunning. Ignore the lower ratings.."
122,"It seems like it is a cute movie, but I don't feel like it contributes much, and gave me serious ""The Polar Express Vibes, and Annie Music vibes, but isn't nearly as good as the two movies. The music was poor, and it's only been half an hour after I watched the movie and I forgot all of the songs, except one, ""Make it Work"" which I did enjoy a lot. and it didn't give enough time to really let you bond with the early characters, and only seemed to be the cliche type villain, where they don't get what they want so they retaliate.The thing is, this movie gives me serious, and I mean SERIOUS ""The Polar Express"" vibes. Some scenes reminded me of it, and just the overall theme of this movie was exactly the same about BELIEVING, but the only difference in my eyes is that The Polar Express has very inspiring music that doesn't compare to anyone else's, and the plotting and entire movie did capture my eyes. (I'd recommend The Polar Express more, it has very unique music that cannot compare, and has it's entirely different thing going on that captures your full attention, while being a bit of a musical itself, it definitely flows better since it goes very well with the scenery and doesn't make them stop to capture more minutes in the movie, it's not lengthy and it will always make you curious for more.)Even if this movie didn't peak my interest, the actors were amazing, even if they were given a cliche script to read off of. I'd ENTIRELY recommend them to play in other movies."
123,"Great movie! Wonderful actors, incredible sets and costumes, and heartfelt songs. Not to mention dancing! A very enjoyable family movie."
124,"Beautifully made, exciting, and playful. A great start to this 2020 Holiday season."
125,"Watched this movie with my kids and by the end we were all crying happy tears. It's a heart warming spectacle with phenomenal costume and production design, infectious songs, endearing characters and a strong central performance from Forest Whittaker.I only gave 9/10 because I would have liked more musical numbers but that's a personal preference. I wasn't disappointed with the ones that were in it.Definitely being added to the annual Christmas movie marathon."
126,"Jingle Jangle, Netflix's latest big Holiday push, is an extravagantly produced musical fantasy with some really good songs and performances. The movie is sort of Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium by way of Willie Wonka and for the most part the elements on display are quite well done."
127,I watched it with my family and we just loved all the musical parts. Vivid colors throughout! This movie is a feast for the eyes. Worth taking the time to watch with your whole family. Merry Christmas!!!
128,"Acting, singing, and choreography were all wonderful. Storyline is not unique but beautifully done and uplifting to the spirit. Sorely needed in difficult times such as these."
129,"Loved it! Beautifully produced, fantastic singing and dancing and special effects. The storyline is a much needed message for children today: to believe in yourself and all things are possible. Great for the entire family!"
130,"Utterly spectacular Christmas family movie!!! Touch of Greatest Showman, Short Circuit all served up with a large dose of family magic. Delightful!"
131,"From the grumpy old man, that got stung by the midas touch of happiness and joy, as a child walking the christmas streets of haugesund, norway at a snowsprinkled evening, ravaging every toyshop and windowexposure of nodding santas and illuminated shining toy trains running through the nicest of the nicest landscapes, making christmas the most magical time of the year.i shall admit as becomming old ive lost that julespirit, but ever now and then i can revive that feeling when viewing a good x-mas film, and this is the one for 2020. the production are pure magic, the music and dance and additional score are just impressing, and the acting plain an truthfull enough to give it at 10 stars,the only thing that could damage that badge were the sound design here and there, but i cant wait to show this to my wife, because she is like a toddler in a pile of presents when viewing this kind of movies.so in all the sad and bitter world of real life with bad economy and a bad pandemic, take a break from it all with jingle jangle, highly recommended"
132,"Jingle Jangle is: ""Something sensational, something spectacular, something revolutionary!""Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey is truly magnificent. The accomplished cast brought a touch of magic to phenomenal festive feel good film.It was written and directed by David E. Talbert and produced by singer John Legend. It stars Hollywood greats including Forest Whitaker, Phylicia Rashad, Hugh Bonneville and the voice of Ricky Martin as the impish Don Juan Diego.Jingle Jangle introduces rising child star Madalen Mills plays Journey Jangle who has a beautiful singing voice and captivating acting skills. Anika Noni Rose ""Dreamgirls"" who plays Jessica Jangle brings soul and power to the original songs that will be sung for many a year to come. Lisa Davina Phillip plays Ms. Johnston adds a touch of British humour to this brilliant film.I loved the colour, the costumes, the story, the songs, every single moment of Jingle Jangle.A very Merry Christmas indeed!"
133,"Jingle Jangle is a must watch movie/musical! The songs, costumes and cast will have you feeling charismatic throughout the movie. It will have you tapping along and leave you with a joyful smile! It had great movie tributes/influences throughout:
The Greatest Showman
Peter Pan
Wall E
Santa Claus
Harry Potter
Marry Poppins
Black Panther
A Christmas Carol... to name a few...
The movie ended with me in tears and basking in the feel good holiday magic 💫 Jingle Jangle will show little girls everywhere that their voice matters and can do anything they want. All they have to do is Believe and step into their World of Wonders and possibilities!"
134,"This had all the ingredients for a great family Christmas film.Good cast, check
Solid story, check
Great set and costume design, check
Excellent special effects, check
Top songs, checkThen whoever did the sound/music mixing and editing went and threw a massive spanner in the works.When it comes to a musical, one of the most important things to get perfect is the sound, but oh my days... the levels are all over the place and it really makes a negative impact.It's especially noticeable during songs where there are lots of dancing and additional background noises.One moment everything sounds great, then the music it too quiet, then the vocals are too loud and then suddenly everything muddies together.It's a shame, as it's a massive flaw in an otherwise enjoyable film."
135,I REALLY wanted to like this film. First I just wanted to say the attention to detail was amazing. The actors were great and was so lovely to see a Christmas film with diversity. Only let down was the story line wasnt very gripping and dare I say slightly boring.
136,"Jingle Jangle a Christmas journey
PG
Director: David E Talbert
Starring: Forest Whitaker, Keegan Michael Key, Hugh Bonneville, Anika Noni Rose, Madalen Mills, Phylicia Rashad, Ricky Martin, justin cornwell, Sharon Rose, Lisa Davina Phillip, Kieron L Dyer, Miles Barrow, Diaana Babnicova etcOverall rating 95/100Jingle jangle a Christmas journey is about an imaginary world that comes to life in a holiday tale about an eccentric toymaker, his adventurous granddaughter, and a magic invention that has the power to change their lives forever. Wow what an absolutely amazing and delightful holiday movie Jingle Jangle Christmas was, there are so many good things to say about this so lets get started.First of all the cinematography was fantastic, the movie had a charming tone, great soundtrack and a unique narrative/ point of view. This movie looked absolutely fantastic, the movies visual creativity and world building was truly fantastic, it just felt like Christmas in one amazing visual explosion of colour amazing set locations and creativity for the story world. The movie also had a very charming tone, every single component of the movie was charming and made you feel all warm inside just like a good Christmas movie should do, this charm never went away and in fact just got better and better as the movie went along. The soundtrack was also fantastic, there was some very catchy and easy to listen to songs that just put a huge smile on my face, and the vocal talent involved was excellent. I Also loved the films unique narrative and viewpoint, telling the story from the perspective of 2 kids and their grandma was really interesting and tied together with the films themes, it also made the film feel like one massive story book which I absolutely loved as well, also adding to the movies visual creativity.I also loved the movies representation, likeable characters, performances and chemistry between characters. This movies racial representation was absolutely excellent, I loved that the majority of the cast was ethnically diverse, it made a refreshing change for a holiday movie and worked excellently. The movie also had incredibly likeable and loveable characters that were very easy to connect with, The granddaughter played by Madalen Mills had heaps of charm and the way she changed Jeronicuses (Forest Whitaker) life and bought the light and happiness back for him was just excellent. The chemistry between them both was also excellent, all the relationships within the movie felt very real and authentic and handled with great emotion and sensitivity. The performances themselves were also very good, and believable adding to the emotion of the movie which I will talk about soon.My only slight negative for the movie would be that it was slightly generic in places. The movie had slightly generic dialogue and characters that has been seen in previous holiday movies especially with the villain being someone supposedly cast aside and getting popularity for themselves.My next few positives would be the character background, set up with the villain and interesting toy creations. I loved the attention to detail and character background for Jeronicus, seeing him happy when he was younger and establishing and developing his relationship between his daughter was excellently done, it didn't feel rushed and established the desired tone and themes and established the characters well,. I also did like the set up with the villain, him being set aside from Jeronicus and his ideas and creations set the villains intentions out well and this transitioned well into the main plot of the movie with an excellent and campy performance from Keegan Michael Key who did a fantastic job. The toy creations were also really creative and were visually striking.My final few positives would be the deep themes, emotional weight and heart-warming ending. The movie actually had a lot of deep themes that was handled very well, how the movie tackled the process of grief and how that effects the relationships within family was very emotional and made the film have a surprising amount of depth, this added to the emotional weight of the movie a lot, the movie which was helped by its performances was genuinely emotional, in its handling of the relationship between Jeronicus and his daughter and will get to a lot of people. The ending was also extremely heart-warming, the movie had very satisfying endings for all of the character arcs and ended the movie perfectly.Overall, Jingle Jangle Christmas is a fantastic holiday movie, with fantastic performances, a great soundtrack, with heaps of charm and is a Christmas classic that I will be revisiting."
137,"I went in blind with this movie. I didn't watch the trailer. And I was pleasantly surprised. I love musicals hence my name. I adores some of the songs in the movie. The STORYLINE is EASY to follow if you pay attention. The people givelinf it negative reviews must be ADHD or just plain miserable and unimaginative. How can you say Felicia Rashad is crappy actor? What about Forrest Whittaker? Come on now. They are film veterans, y'all need to go back to bed and get in right side.The story essentially is about family and believing in yourself when all hope is lost. The impossible is POSSIBLE if you have faith in your ability. And don't forget to ask for help when you need it the most! How hard is that to follow? Don't listen to the negative people!Watch it for yourself. Absolutely fantastical and purely for people with hearts!"
138,"It started off very good and promising. I loved the music and the actors were wonderful singers. I loved the charm and magical feel and atmosphere. However, I did start to lose interest towards the middle of the film. But by third act I was engaged again. So pacing could have been better.I did love the overall story. And as mentioned above it had this wonderful magical feel to it that felt perfect for Christmas. I really loved the young girl who played Journey and thought she really stole the show. She definitely is the heart of the film. I also felt the film needed more Anika Noni Rose. She has such a rather small part but she's absolutely great with what she does. However, I wish the story could have done without was the Don Juan toy (voiced by Ricky Martin). Every scene with that character felt too corny. Too childish. And therefore by association, I just didnt care for Keegan Michael Key's character Gustafon. He was less annoying, but still came across a little stereotypical villain. I do get that it is a family film and so obviously there has to be elements for kids. But I was totally fine with the Buddy 3000 scenes. I just dont think that character worked for me.I would say that the film was enjoyable enough. I do think its a worth a watch with the family this season. Do I think it will become a Christmas staple? Honestly, I dont know. I enjoyed it for it was but Im honestly not sure if I would re-visit it again next year. Especially when there are other faves and new content to consider.I listed the film as 7. But I think its probably somewhere between a 6.5 and 7.Also, the movie kind of felt like a mix of The Greatest Showman with A Christmas Carol."
139,"(No spoilers enjoy) The Prince of Egypt is a way better film don't waste your time.. animation was nice so effort is in the look of the film Aesthetics.. this film have no sense, the good from earlier, thats deh 2 outta 10.. the rest should be banned at least in the America's and other places with the internet for them to who have Netflix..."
140,"This is a beautiful movie with a diverse cast. The costumes are amazing. My kids loved it. It is a little long for younger kids, but its to be expected with a musical."
141,"I found the movie to be a messy amalgamation of good movies we've all seen before - lacking originality (so I'm saying lazy). The narration and camera angles are akin to The Grinch - The 'belief' is just the recycled Santa Christmas spirit vibe; there's a bit Christmas Carol in there along with a number of others.To be honest, it felt like this movie was more about demonstrating equal opportunities and diversity rather than delivering a good show.Perhaps for kids who aren't aware it's plagiarised most Christmas favourites, it may be a decent watch.Forest Whittaker is the saving grace in acting terms."
142,What a wonderful movie - nothing is IMPOSSIBLE if we believe :)
143,What an absolutely delightful movie! What a great family movie! It was nice to see # 5 alive again (Short Circuit)! 😊 Forrest Whitaker was wonderful!
144,The head and voice of Elias are the same as Wall-E.
145,"The plot is a holiday fairy tale, told like a story time. Some of the sets look like recycled from The Santa Clause movies. The musical numbers are catchy in spots. And effects are also descent.
Forrest Whitaker does play a broken down toy maker very well, and his scenes with the kids are watchable. Keegan -Michael Key is also charming has the main viilain. The kids also bring some fun to this also. This is a fun holiday film for everybody to enjoy."
146,"Amazing effects - some of the best special effects I've ever seen. Incredible costumes. But it was just trying too hard with not enough story.And it was trying to be the next ""The Greatest Showman"" but none of the songs are memorable.If they had fleshed out the beginning of the story and shortened the second act and made it less boring, it might have worked.In the end, beautiful to look at, but blah."
147,"The magic of wit and creativity that this movie portrays is very well executed. Adding to it the mix of dance and glam and colors in all its corners puts you in the christmas vibe. However i couldn't stop seeing Magorium's magic store, Wall-E's voice and shape, and the trip to Neverland with PeterPan and Wendy.
Mashing all those themes up in the movie removed the dazzle that we were supposed to have on Journey's inherited creativity and wit. Several short and loose ends that needed more focus.
All in all its a great movie to watch...in the holiday season.."
148,"Jingle Jangle is a brilliant piece of work for the whole family! David Talbert's masterpiece represents all that is good when a storyteller creates an epic adventure that parallels so much of how we desire life to be. From amazing acrobatic dances to moving songs, CGI that doesn't detract or distract from the humanity of the story, this really sets the bar high for Netflix and for every other studio as well. It felt good to watch a new story that had the familiarity of The Greatest Showman, Mary Poppins, A Christmas Carol, Mr Magorium and Willy Wonka. The sets and costumes are extravagantly elegant, the music is delightful, and the cast is one of the best ensemble casts assembled anywhere. Watch it and I believe that you will fall in love with Jingle Jangle."
149,"Wow wow for two days now I have watched this movie about five times. My daughter say to me Mama this is the best movie ever. I agree, the songs are incredible The costume are to die for, well done guys."
150,"The only thing i didn't expect from this movie is, there is less confrontation between Mr Jangle & his former assistant. As an adult watching this kid's vibe magical movie, it still gives me some good time & moment to enjoy this movie until the end.
I did not expect much but i would love to see more what Buddy 3000 can offer for the whole movie besides believing in yourself for it to be alive."
151,"The cast was great, the dancing wonderful and the story was above average. I wasn't a huge fan of the music used which really took me out of the movie every time the singing started. The movie was a bit long and that ending was just odd. I loved the casts chemistry and the characters just the story needed some pizazz."
152,This movie is plain awful! Have seen much better Christmas movies on the Hallmark Channel. Be warned! Do not waste your time on this garbage movie!
153,"I just loved this, one of the best Christmas movies I've seen for a while! The sets and costumes were amazing. Original story, fun, it had something for everyone!
Perfect family Christmas movie!"
154,"Just what we needed!Brilliantly written, it's like watching chocolate on the screen. I bet this would make a great musical at the theatre at the west end.The sets look great, acting's spot on and a great ending.Thanks Netflix."
155,"Jingle Jangle: A Christmas journey is a 2020 American musical fantasy film. I saw the trailers on Netflix and thought it looked really good, so me and my mum decided to watch it on a Saturday nite in lockdown. The storyline was okay, on the other hand the music was really good. I wouldn't say this movie is 10 as I have seen much better musicals in my time but was okay to watch. I think maybe children might like it but some scenes are more for adults as children might not understand the storyline. The movie was hyped up to much and was not as good as thought it would be. A little disappointed but overall it was okay."
156,Since when did content on Netflix become so wet? Have I been hit on the head or are they trying to reduce the populus to drones now they have a captive audience....
157,"While my 2 year old was fascinated with the movie, it was not very entertaining for me. Combine the big dancing numbers of the Greatest Showman, with the set from Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium with any Disney movie and you've seen the movie. Obvious Lip-syncing. The singing and dancing Shakespearean Choic are just too over the top. Could have been good without all the unneeded theatrics."
158,"Lovely characters, commendable well-known actors (the young lady playing Journey is marvelous), vibrant costuming and choreography, but....though it really does have a ""Greatest Showman"" vibe, the flipping back and forth between animation, puppetry, cgi, live, ""now"" versus ""then"" versus story-telling was just exhausting. Greatest Showman is riveting and I watch it often. This movie though, I can't keep the storyline straight. Every time I think I'm focused, there's another overly loud, overwhelming musical number and I'm lost again. I wanted to like this more and I tried to finish, but it's giving me a headache so I'm bailing out. Good try though."
159,"Whimsical musical enjoyable for kids and adults alike. Stunning costumes and sets, gorgeous music that fills you with Christmas joy Really enjoyed this! Just waiting to buy the soundtrack when it comes out on CD so I can listen in the car!"
160,"Just so predictable and a melange of so many different films, Wonka/ The Greatest Showman to name a couple!
Surprising Forrest Whittaker was part of this considering his repertoire! Animation was brilliant tho but not enough to carry such a cheesy film, didn't have much Xmas spirit either, fell very short."
161,"Very disappointing Christmas movie,after the year we've all had I watched this in anticipation of a much needed morale lifting film. The story,acting and the songs were very poor.
I wanted it to be good but it wasn't,the only bright spark was Forest Whitaker as he stood out amongst some very poor actors.
Am hoping for better off Christmas Chronicles 2."
162,"Setting is oke , but storyline, acting isn't good. The songs are weak and ads nothing of value .
Overall not good enough"
163,"Beautiful sets, the colors, the animations, etc., but... Too many elements, too many pointless characters, scenes, songs, messages...
It's like whoever created it were told that they only had one chance to make a movie in their lifetime so they throw in every idea they had and this waffly movie came out. It's like Hugo, meets *batteries mot included, Christmas Carrol, Toy Story, the cat in the hat, wall-e.."
164,"This gorgeous musical-like Christmas production is high on special effects, large dance numbers, and a diversity of musical numbers. It glows like Broadway Production number with lavish sets and powerful theatrical costumes, and dramatic emotional performances. Strangely enough though, this movie extravaganza seems to lack the traditional number of musical pieces and plays more like a child's fantasy movie with a lot of musical scenes, instead of being a real musical that allows the audience to sing, hum along in a seamless fashion throughout the movie. Nevertheless, this is an enjoyable, huge production piece that deserves rapt attention, in the fashion of Hugo (2011) with music or a youthful fantasy version of Chicago (2002)."
165,I am not big on musicals that's only reason it didn't get a ten. This is a wonderful movie for a family night. It's a make you feel good movie.
166,First off the music in this was amazing. The dancing and singing all on point. I would love to see this on Broadway. Story was original and decent. Great for kids. Few flat spots in the story where it could have been better. One for the more exciting and fulfilling Christmas movies out recently.
167,My wife and I watch this Christmas tale today and found it to be a joy part Broadway musical part mystical Christmas tale but most of all a very entertaining movie Christmas movie with some shortcomings in spots but heck its Christmas and all of the adults and children who enjoy the holiday. Did I mention this movie visual was spectacular to watch. I gave it a nine for giving us something a cut above and different from the run of of a the mill Christmas story.
168,"I have to be honest. when i saw this was a 'black' x-mas movie i did not want to watch it. I thought this would be another one of those 'inclusive/represent' movies. Wich usually feel forced. THIS MOVIE DID NOT FEEL THAT WAY. It is an amazing movie with good acting, singing, dancing, songs and a lot of magic. Oh and don't forget about the costumes. I love this movie and nothing felt like it was added for political reasons. Just a good movie where most of the people just happend to be black. (ofcourse i understand that that's not the case but as long as the wright people get hired regardless of skin color, gender or sexual preference i'm happy and this movie feels like thats what they did)"
169,"Just watched with the kids and it's awesome! Great effects and production, dances and songs blew your socks off. Love forrest whitaker and his performance was incredible! A lovely little story and 'buddy 5 (3000) is alive!!!!!'"
170,"......You will LOVE this....Mixing the magic of Christmas with the magic of special FXForrest Whittaker, as usual, is awesome and to be honest the film didn't really have any weak links. Where we generally see Christmas films inundated with romantic rom-coms this made a very refreshing alternative to the normality of the genre.Has the same heart as The Greatest Showman with hints of Wal-E and The Nutcracker in what I can only imagine will be a Christmas film that will grow and grow with time!!Enjoy this Christmas with your loved ones and if only for a short while let's forget the trials and tribulations that 2020 has thrown at us!"
171,A Wonderful Movie gives you the Joy & Happiness with the Christmas Holiday Spirit.Really Enjoyed it.
172,An amazing family movie. Great for kids. A plus to Netflix Christmas movies.
173,"Finally a musical I could enjoy to the fullest again. The latest musicals have all had great songs but were lacking a real interesting story. But this ... Not only is the music stunning and beautifully performed but this musical also has a fantastic, magical storyline. It is a mixture of Finding Neverland and everything you wish for in a Christmas movie. Sometimes it was a little too over the top, so I am giving it a 9/10 stars."
174,"That is the first thing my mind went to when it opened to a large shop, full of moving toys.. and magic. Not original there, but still definitely original. Was not expecting a musical, though, so that was surprising. Pretty cute, my little niece loved the music."
175,"I loved the snowball fight and then I saw the locals were in the film. This is awesome! I'm from Halloweentown/St.Helens, OR. Anytime a production includes the locals, makes it a special film. I also loved Buddy! Thanks!"
176,Jingle Jangle is Netflix's foray into the Christmas musical market.Forest Whitaker is the grumpy inventor Jeronicus Jangle. Many years ago he was the greatest toy inventor. Then his young apprentice Gustafson egged on by a villainous toy stole his his various designs and became famous and wealthy.Now Jeronicus is heavily in debt and has lacked a creative spark for many years. When his estranged granddaughter visits him he is coaxed back and inspired to work in his latest creation. A talking robot.This is an engaging film but let down by forgettable songs. It needed a big show stopping number. The kids might find the songs a tad dull and also the movie is overlong. The colourful production values are very good and almost Disneyesque.It does borrow heavily from other movies. The Princess Bride in the way it is framed as a grandmother tells a story. The Greatest Showman is the obvious inspiration and Wall-E by the look of the robot.
177,"The film is stunning. Beautiful sets, costumes, CGI, and talented actors. But the story is so boring, and the musical numbers are dire. It desperately wants to be The Greatest Showman, but doesn't come close. Also, its not at all Christmassy."
178,"Having just reviewed the darkly comic Christmas story Fatman, starring Mel Gibson, I anticipated being hauled into the light spirit of a classic-type holiday musical called Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey. I was right-it is like other Christmas stories specially crafted with high voices and high jinks for kids, and not so much for adults.The story is boilerplate holiday sentiment-family trying to bring everyone together amicably, greedy guys trying to tear family apart, and songs suiting meaning without much to remember except bouncy tunes and dazzling dancers. Oh, yes, one of the only white guys is the banker Delacroix (Hugh Bonneville), who is about to foreclose on the shop (been there and better done in It's a Wonderful Life).Jeronicus (Forest Whitaker as the older, Justin Cornwell as younger) has lost his gift for invention as well as his invention book, thanks to former assistant Gustafson (Keegan-Michael Key), a disaffected emerging inventor seemingly ignored by his boss. Jeronicus, now just a toymaker with a toy shop now pawnshop reminiscent of the kind of clutter Johnny Depp made magic with) will, of course, be saved by his irrepressible granddaughter, Jessica (Madalen Mills-no child could be that cute, but she is), who has his inventive genes in good order.Writer-director David Talbot knows how to create and sustain the imaginative world of effervescent kids to complement it with serviceable songs from Philip Lawrence, Davy Nathan, Michael Diskint, and John Legend (a producer of this film) like ""Square Root of Possible"" and Legend's R & B ""Make It Work."" ""Magic Man G"" may be the most memorable, and ""This Day"" could have been from any Broadway musical.Jingle Jangle has the potential to be a holiday staple despite grouchy critics like me for whom Bad Santa is the mark of excellence. If you gravitate to over-crowded Dickensian sets, clear villains, weepy moms and grandmas, and magical inventions like the High-flying Buddy 3000, a robot who talks and seems descended from E.T. or Wall-e, then relax by the fire with your kids and a modest cognac, and watch it on Netflix.You may doze, but then you can pick up the story because you've seen it all before. Merry Christmas."
179,"Nice story, ruined by the musical!! Every 15 minutes...God!!!"
180,"The movie was missing something. It just seemed too simple. I think a darker tone would've elevated this film. But regardless, it's unique and kids will like it."
181,"Beautiful story with amazing cast.. but the sets, costumes, music and choreography make it absolutely magical."
182,"I do not understand those negative reviews at all. This was a fun, sweet holiday musical aimed at kids but enjoyable for adults too. The music and dancing was top notch. The costumes and sets were eye candy. Such talent all the way around. I guess haters gotta hate, but don't let it deter you from watching. This was really a lot of fun to watch and it got better and better. I'm going to have to watch again because I want to learn the songs. Love it!"
183,"A Christmas adventure movie.
Made of magic.
It is about an inventor who achieves his greatest creation and is stolen by his apprentice, unleashing a great adventure.
A great blockbuster.
Quality.
Entertaining
Family.
With well-executed musicals and original songs, although in two or three moments the musical ensemble looks a bit out of proportion.
Forest Whitaker is spectacular as always and also sings.
Ricky Martin voices an animated character.
Only two or three moments the special effects are not fully achieved, the animated characters and the sequences where there is action are not well achieved, the video game graphics look better.
It reminds us of what Christmas is, to give, to share, to spend it with our loved ones, to forgive, but above all to have faith and believe.
A movie that aims to become a Christmas classic."
184,"Jingle Jangle mirrors many Christmas films that we know and love and provides a breath of life into a recently stale genre. Pulling themes and familiar tropes from classics such as Edward Scissorhands, The Wizard of Oz, A Christmas Carol and The Grinch. From the music to the costumes, characters and scenary Jingle Jangle is ""something sensational, something spectacular, something revolutionary.""We are invited to listen to the tale of the world's best inventor, Jeronicus Jangle's (Forest Whitaker) fall from grace due to the thieving acts of his apprentice Gustafson (Keegan-Michael Kay). Losing everything, we see a beaten and broken Jeronicus, in a shabby, bleak, Scrooge-esque state, fighting for survival and in need of a Christmas miracle, to help save his shop and his home. Will his family, friends and colleagues provide him with the support he needs to regain his identity, imagination and creativity?From the very beginning Jingle Jangle is a wonder to the eyes and ears. Jeronicuses environment looking like a mix between Diagon Alley and the city center of Whoville; you are sucked into the world effortlessly. With its streets populated with individuals wearing clothing resembling the familiar bright wrapping paper patterns we use every year. With a contrasting emerald colour scheme, for Gustafson and his henchmen; echoing that of another fraudulent inventor ... or wizard, that we tend to see this time of year. Matching the dazzling garments, we are treated to slightly cheesy, but totally expected, impromptu song and dance numbers throughout. Something that even Jeronicus questions during his love interest Ms Johnston's (Lisa Davina Phillip) solo number. ""Are you drunk? Background dancers?"". A stand out performance by Journey (Madalen Mills), Jeronicuses Granddaughter is one to look out for.With the introduction of Journey and her meeting Edison, Jeronicuses assistant, we are filled with hope as we find they have what Jeronicus has lost. Creativity, wonder and belief in themselves to follow their dreams.Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey is a heart-warming, colourful, thoughtful, underdog adventure for all ages. High budget production, slick performances and choreography, and a memorable tune here or there. Jingle Jangle reminds us of what it is to have a childlike curiousity when approaching all that we do and to never give up. Even when times are tough (I'm looking at you... 2020).""A child with an imagination always belongs"" as does this film, to your watchlist.8/10, would watch again."
185,"I rarely write reviews, but this wonderful movie warrants it. I'm disappointed but not suprised by the obvious posts from racists who consistently downgrade films with predominantly black casts. This movie is not at all racial unless merely having a black cast makes it so. If that's the case, are all the holiday movies without any people of color suddenly racist? Of course not! Let's just enjoy the movie for what it is - an endearing holiday musical filled with magic, stunning visuals, catchy music and great choreography. It's also a wholesome family movie with a positive message. I'm adding it to my collection of movies that become a holiday tradition."
186,"This film very much takes a leaf out of its flying Buddy 3000 robot. It is wonderfully and masterfully constructed; it is visually spectacular; and, at its core, it brings a beating, emotional heart."
187,Don't waste your time on it. Rewatch a classic christmas film instead
188,"Mumbled dialogue, waaaaaay too long and out of place musical numbers.
It has all the ingredients to make a blockbuster, but widely misses the mark. The first 15 minutes are excellent, but it takes a dark turn after that and starts to meander.Avoid if you value your time."
189,"The story itself is simple and endearing, however the film itself is too full. Alsmost as if it is trying to overcompensate, while not focus on any character properly. It is just not funny enough, and extremely childish. And too long to be entertaining for children"
190,"I am a HUGE FAN The Greatest Showman. I had no expectations of this movie coming close the Greatest Showman. But it's cute. The story starts off like a tragic Disney flick and it's ""kinda sorta"" cute but a little cheesy. The gal who is hitting on the father didn't seem to be a necessary part of the story and honestly, the scene of her hitting on the father/toy creator was completely unnecessary and made my daughter uncomfortable as it was an unwanted ""advance"" to a guy who was completely unaware how she felt about him.It didn't need as many songs, as we agreed there was one song we were interested in listening to again.The setting was adorable with cute Christmas vibes!"
191,"Like my summary suggests, the music, unlike the lyrics, was really unfitting for the theme and time period of this movie. Saying this, the music was really good and enjoyable non the less.Sets and costumes were really good. Sadly there are not many locations, but they do make the best out of it. The dancing choreography was better than expected. CGI was a lot better and more believable than most big block busters, so that is a huge plus.I really wish the entire movie was with animated puppets, because they looked really awesome. The actors were not bad, quite the opposite actually.It was a shame they used an older actor for the main character, instead of using the same just with some facial changes to make him appear ""older"".Humor, while not really amusing, was not bad that it got distracting.I do not know if children will enjoy it, since there is a lot of talking.
Even tho the music was very unfitting, I still enjoyed it."
192,"I only really watched this because of the people saying it's like The Greatest Showman... It's not. The story is pretty dull - although it had a promising start.
It's pretty well acted, the cast is likeable, the song and dance routines are ok while on screen but instantly forgettable.
The trailer made it look like this was going to be some sort of Christmas buddy movie with the girl and her robot but the robot is barely in it.
It's fine, the kids will enjoy it but it's not destined to be a classic which is a shame as it could have been so much more! And more should of been made of Mrs. Johnston and her backing singers who are great!
My guess is that a lot of people will really enjoy and rate it highly for it's diversity of cast..."
193,"I had a high hopes for this movie as a lover of musicals and family movies. I will say that my kids liked it and the costumes and dancing were fun, but I found the story to be very boring."
194,"Conceited, contrived, trying too hard. Good cinematography though."
195,But why the hell do they all think they have to sing?
196,"I will admit I am a cynical man, but when I was watching this Netflix is clearly trying to paint a perspective of how they see the world and be at the forefront of racial change even if it means making this movie hyper stereotypical and go backwards in what they think they're achieving.Besides the aggressive racial ploy the movie for what it's worth is not terribly bad. It has a great production value and it's easy on the eyes. The acting is really good as well but the movie also falls into the trap where it tries to do too many things at once and at sometimes seemed like it was trying to do too much and lost itself.If you're into Christmas movies for the sake of it, this might be your thing, but it doesn't bring anything new or classic to the table. Essentially a rip of Greatest Showman with a netflix burning left agenda twist on it. It was lighthearted enough to make me smile in certain bits and this is why I wouldn't give it anything below a 5. But this movie is definitely passable."
197,Utterly dreadful nothing to recommend poor very very poor
198,Some you win some you lose this doesn't work it's dreadful
199,"Too long, bad acting, overdoing it way too much. Very disappointing. Besides the sets and the costumes it's a waste of time"
