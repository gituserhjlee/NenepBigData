0,"Modern Family is primarily a comedy that revolves around three families that are held together more by their virtue of acceptance and love than by the blood ties that connect them. Each character has been thoughtfully written out and played to perfection by a slew of actors who take your breath away. A family that is so imperfectly perfect that you draw the expectations for your own family - present or future - from their actions, morals, decisions and values.It's a show where an old rich man marries a young woman of colour; where a white patriarchal figure accepts, not without his reservations, his openly gay son and his partner; where a gay couple gets its chance at parenting when they adopt an Asian girl; where we have a teenage pregnancy create the foundations of a loving family; where an old couple decides to give parenting a spin in the second innings of their life; where each child grows up emboldened with the confidence that his family is there to support him/her to become their own person.What the show does impeccably well is throw societal expectations for a toss to underline only one thing - who we are and choose to be does not dictate the rightness or the wrongness of our being. The only this that does is the purity of our hearts. That is it. One episode after the other, we have the writers create interwoven and hilarious narratives into episodes that break stereotypes and societal conventions to showcase the meaningless of their existence.Despite the seriousness of the central theme, the show is outright hilarious. It is witty - much too witty to understand every joke, every emotion, every retort in just one watch. The writing is spot on. It makes you live the characters and fall in love with each one of them - one episode at a time. It's made me pause the show because I had to laugh so bad. It has also made me pause to make way for a few tears which flowed without announcement, without purpose. The families, despite their eccentricities and unconventional way of being, are ever so relatable in how they love one another. The only way to truly love someone is to let them thrive in their own choices - that's what I learn from this show - every day.It's unparalleled what this show has done for the people who were too scared to come out of their closets and the parents who were too scared to have a kid who did. I cannot recommend this show enough. You will feel a myriad of emotions when you truly embrace the depth of the stories and therein lies its beauty."
1,"For those still in withdrawal from the cancellation of Arrested  Development, let me write you a prescription: Modern Family.  The comparisons are obvious and with good reason. The postmodern comedy  for the 21 century was ushered in by The Office(UK) and Arrested  Development, but I, for one, doubted something could come along and  satiate my longing for another truly, original comedy.  Albeit, you may initially be wary to see yet another mockumentary-style  show, but by the end of the pilot, you'll be smiling/laughing way too  hard to stay cynical. Thus far, the plot lines have been really fresh  and the characters are so, for lack of a better word, lovable. This  show fulfills all my comedy needs, and I feel like I must resort to the  listing of relevant adjectives: Witty, dry, smart, outlandish, silly,  clever, cute, sarcastic, subtle, not-so subtle. HILARIOUS.  I hate to say it, but the laugh tracks and raw goofyness of classic  sitcoms like 'Seinfeld' and 'Friends' are obsolete and leave something  to be desired. You will find that something in Modern Family.  And who knows, maybe some of the more painfully funny and poignant  scenarios will reveal insight into the changing dynamics of both the  modern family and modern comedy.  Great show. Period.  And let's get it right this time around: don't cancel good TV shows.  Pretty please?"
2,"Give this show a chance. I really kind of watched it against my will, but figured I'd give it a shot. I bet out of a hundred pilots, I would like maybe one - this was that one. I literally laughed out loud at numerous parts - the way that it comes together is interesting / well-done - each couple has an interesting balance - great dialog (IMDB won't let me spell it with a ""ue"" at the end) - original characters - I'm impressed.I don't think I've ever seen ABC come out with something in this vein. Normally their shows are a bit watered down, but this is edgy and as fresh as anything I've seen hit network TV. I know that comparisons to Arrested Development will be frequent, but I think that this has more structure. The characters aren't as wacky, but they're more believable and easier to sympathize with in my eyes. Tremendous acting, great kid actors - I forwarded the pilot to a bunch of people already, and I feel lucky that I got to watch it before it came out officially."
3,"I just want to say that I love this show!! It is good family entertainment. I believe all of us can relate to someone in it or have a relative that can. For those of you who only saw the pilot (which I watched by accident and loved)please don't give up on it, it is really good comedy. I can't decide who my favorite character is, Cam, Phil...all of them, each week another one cracks me up. I rarely watch TV but this one has me hooked. I agree that the format is much like The Office, which I also think is funny, but the shots to the camera, the expressions are some of the best parts. We have all of the shows on dvr because my daughter and I usually can't wait till the next Wednesday to see it again! Again...Best show in years!"
4,"Modern Family is one of the best shows on TV in 2009.It's written by smart and funny people. It shares some DNA with Arrested Development and Fraiser, but has a little bit more heart.6 episodes in and I am still impressed and still laugh out loud.I usually avoid ABC because their programming in years past has been terrible and vanilla. Happy to see they have taken some chances on this show and hooray for them, it seems to be finding an audience and critics love it too.I usually hate shows with little kids in the cast... they usually end up getting used as cute crutches when writers run out of ideas, but Modern Family has been giving the kids sharp dialogue to match the grown ups.The gay Mitchell and Cameron couple are portrayed honestly and they are hilarious.The very underrated Ed O'Neill is pitch perfect as the grouchy but soft family patriarch. Sofía Vergara who plays his Colombian trophy wife is excellent and very funny in what could have been written as a terrible bimbo role.I wasn't sold on Ty Burrell as the dad who tries too hard to be cool after the pilot... but he's a slow burn, and now it works.Julie Bowen as the slightly off kilter mom adds an anchoring charm to the mix.Every person on this show gets good lines, and the quality is holding up... I hope they win a boatload of Emmys."
5,"Up to Season 7 was great, a laugh a minute but season 8 & 9 just bomb I think I manage one laugh a show. They should rename it to Sarcasm Family it's just full of bickering and bad jokes."
6,"When I saw summer promos of this sit com I thought it looked forced and very predictable. As Cam would exclaim, ""Surprise!"" It is well cast, written, and consistently laugh out loud funny. The documentary camera bit is actually as well done, no, even better than one of the best, The Office. I recognized most of the talented adult cast, they have great chemistry, and it was so hilarious when Shelley Long guest starred as the ex wife. But it is the kid actors on the show who are amazingly well directed in their parts- Manny, as a son, stepson, brother, uncle, and cousin is a hoot: he can wisecrack with the best of them, and then break your heart when dad isn't able to fulfill his promise for the weekend. I always thought Steve Levitan did agreat job with ""Just Shoot Me"", on NBC and I think he and ChristopherLloyd have got a hit show for ABC. Take a look at this so ABC won't cash in on some more ridiculous reality shows."
7,"I'm just gonna say that this show has gotten so bad lately that i started literally hating all characters. Each and every single one. Well, just about...After pretty good first few seasons, everything that followed was getting harder and harder to watch. Jokes are so lame that elicit more and more facepalms.The only character i still respect in this show is Ed O'Neill, and that is just because he used to be a women's shoe salesman... I will never forget Al Bundy."
8,"I saw the trailer for this show a while back and was instantly intrigued. Shot in a ""mockumentary"" style it follows the lives of three couples who's various members are related as family members. Although the set-up is slightly cliché, a gay couple, a stereotypical family and a Columbian wife and son (from her first marriage) with her American husband, this is where the standard ends. The dialogue is fantastic and at many points I found myself really laughing quite loudly, something which is very rare for a TV show to accomplish for me personally. The casting is also spot on with the inclusion of Ed O'Neill (the infamous Al Bundy!), Ty Burrell, Julie Bowen and Sofía Vergara, with each actor really bringing something unique to the mix. I strongly recommend this show to anybody who appreciates good comedy, the ""to-camera"" sections of the dialogue have a very close resemblance to the original UK version of ""The Office"" and for those who are familiar with this, Modern Family will be a welcomed return. Great show, great acting, great script. Highly recommended."
9,"Because I have not one, but two, DVRs I'm able to give all the new shows a chance, which I did with ""Modern Family"". Am I ever glad I did!! I have found that everything about this show is believable. Though the situations that occur during any given half-hour show would obviously never all happen in that short a stretch, I have no difficulty in believing that they would all happen. I never feel that anyone's exaggerating to draw a laugh or milking a laugh. It's just the only ""laugh out loud for the whole show"" on TV today. It is, IMHO, the funniest show since MASH, and that's saying some.There are some parallels to another of my favorites, the little appreciated ""Arrested Development"", ""Modern Family"" has its own unique flavor; and the flavor is . . . hilarious!!!"
10,"I weep for the untimely departure of the wit and intelligence of this show's first seasons.
For the past two seasons, I felt the writing less subtle than before. But this (hopefully) final season takes the cake! The stories are garbled, the direction inexistant at best and the acting on constant overload.
I won't cry its demise."
11,"It's hard to believe there was a time when I rated this show 10/10. In the first seasons it was so funny and clever, jokes were not new but it just felt genuine. Somewhere between season 6 and 7 this show should have ended. Characters are just a joke, it makes no sense they are this stupid and plane, that was not them at the beginning. The 10th is just unbearable to watch, I didn't think it was possible but it just gets worse with every episode. It's hard to me to believe in 2009 I waited every week to watch a new episode. Just another show that suffered from wanting to make more seasons than necessary. Watch until season 5 and just stop there. Really."
12,"I decided to check out ""Modern Family"" after hearing all of the critical praise about it. The show was five episodes in, so I caught up on the action online. And I must say that the acclaim is well-deserved. The show is nothing like what I'd imagined when I read about it. It is not a typical three-camera sitcom and it actually IS as gut-wrenchingly funny as people say.With any modern TV comedy, people are going to compare it with ""Arrested Development"", which is highly regarded as one of the greatest shows ever by many. ""Modern Family"" is not quite ""A.D."", but I can see why some people may compare the two.""Modern Family"", like ""Arrested Development"", is a comedy about a wacky extended family that is filmed in a quasi-documentary style, similar to ""The Office"". The characters don't acknowledge the camera, but they do contribute ""talking head"" segments to supplement the action. The show is less cartoony and surreal than ""Arrested Development"" or ""30 Rock"", but the comedy can still get pretty off-the-wall.The ensemble cast is great. There are three branches of a single family. The patriarch (Ed O'Neill) has re-married, bringing a Colombian-born wife and her son into the fold. The daughter (Julie Bowen) and her husband (Ty Burrell) have three kids. The son (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and his partner (Eric Stonestreet) have just adopted a Vietnamese baby. The show focuses mainly on the parents and how they raise their families and interact with each other in today's society.My favorite character is Phil (Burrell), who plays the dad who tries to be ""hip"". He means well, but he's really kind of a wimpy husband. Phil's always putting himself in awkward situations (without always realizing it) and some of his lines are hilarious. He tries so hard to be the ""cool dad"". Next I like Cameron (Stonestreet), who's gay and proud of it. He's sensible and sensitive and he has some great lines, too.Although I haven't really connected with the show like I have with some others (just a matter of personal style), there's no denying that ""Modern Family"" is an above-average comedy. It's written well, with humor sewn throughout the fabric of each episode, and each episode packs some laugh-out-loud moments. And I say this as someone who rarely actually bursts into audible laughter. (Occasionally, with shows like ""A.D."" or ""30 Rock"".) This show does it, though. Phil, in particular, has me in stitches.To give you a comparison, I'd say ""Modern Family"" is like a cross between ""The Office"" and ""Arrested Development"". Presented more like the former, with humor and content drifting more toward the latter. More grounded in reality than ""A.D."", though, and without some of the triple-entendres and zingers.The show finds windows to sneak in some wholesome family morals like togetherness and acceptance, but the episodes always end with a laugh.But the rumors are true. ""Modern Family"" IS a very funny new comedy. Check it out on ABC or ABC.com if you don't believe me. (Or wherever else it's available.) It definitely should be on your radar."
13,"Modern Family started out great. However, the later seasons have become more and painful to watch."
14,"This show was great for the first 5 seasons, it was original, funny, smart.... then the kids grew up and the writing lost its humour. Season 6 was ok, but after that it just went downhill. It's such a shame they didn't end on a high note rather than drag it out, flogging the horse until it was well and truly dead. Part of the problem was the child actors who were adorable when little but lost their ability to act as they aged!"
15,"I wasn't sure about this show. I liked Ed O'Neil and wanted to see him succeed in another comedy. I talked my girlfriend into watching the pilot episode and we laughed uproariously. The casting was so good. Ed O'Neil's delivery is absolutely pitch perfect. Ty Burrell is annoying but, in the perfect over-compensating way that you would expect from a dad who feels his Life has aged while he has remained a teenager. Julie Bowen manages to under play her role as Ty's annoyed and insecure wife. Sofia Vergara is absolutely gorgeous as O'Neil's younger, Latina wife. Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Eric Stonestreet are hysterical together. The show ties together so well each and every episode."
16,"Modern Family is an exemplary show. It's got everything to love in a sitcom. It has humor, heart, great acting, great writing, likable characters, I could go on forever. The jokes are sharp, believable and it's also not too hyper like a lot of today's sitcoms are. It has quieter moments. And not that I'm bothered by a laugh track, but it also understands that you don't need a laugh track to be funny. I love to watch it with my family every Wednesday. My family and I love it to death. It's as well one of those rare examples of a show that hasn't suffered from what I like to call ""SpongeBob Syndrome"" (With flanderizing characters, recycling episode plots, etc.). I definitely recommend it :)."
17,Not funny at all! I gave this a chance and tried a few episodes but gave up. It's the opposite of laugh out loud funny! Why do so many people like this and why does it win so many awards? The situations are so contrived and exaggerated. People just stand around looking daft and some supposed joke takes place. Hate the camera work too.Sofia Vergara is quite a natural comic but the rest just look ill at ease and unpleasant.This is the most overrated comedy in years. How can this compare with Big Bang Theory?I can't be the only one who doesn't think this is funny.
18,"Scripted shows that employ a documentary format often use the P.O.V. talking-head shot as a gimmick to put more visual variety into the show, and to create a style of story-telling that they hope will keep your attention without having to improve the plot or characterizations. You can tell because they often go back to the interview at the most weakly-written moments. This is one problem, but not the major one, with Modern Family. The aspects that disturb me the most are these: they're supposed to be modern families and there are no working mothers (do the writers misunderstand the term ""post-feminist era""?) except for a few temporary jobs in single eps. Also there are no poor or even lower-middle-class characters. Actually, I do remember one character who was poor, but of course he was a one-time character on a Christmas episode. I'm sick of the characters whining about first-world problems like not being able to buy the ""perfect gift"" for their spouse on their birthday. What's so tragic about buying the iPad the day before or after their birthday? I realize this is a satire, but the writers don't seem to have that much contempt for the people they're satirizing. They don't seem to be TRYING to show how spoiled and self-centered many upper-middle-class are (it just comes out that way). That's not part of the satire, except maybe with the character of Haley (Sarah Hyland). Another thing that bothers me is that Claire (Julie Bowen) comes off as a lot crazier than the writers seem to intend. She's ALWAYS breathlessly freaking out, and it's more irritating than funny. In real life she's be at least an OUTpatient in some psychiatric facility. The gay couple (Eric Stonestreet and Jesse Tyler Ferguson) are gay stereotypes, especially Cameron, but since I hate political correctness and they're actually funny it doesn't bother me much. It would be nice, however, if the show did what it could to improve America's perception of gay people. Since Camoron is a prissy, whining, crying drama queen, the other character, Mitchell, could be the antithesis of a gay stereotype. The comedy could come from people thinking the character is straight. Manny's (Rico Rodriguez's) character doesn't resemble any human being on the planet. He's too cartoonish (sitcoms have always had kids who act like adults and adults who act like kids) and neither funny nor well-acted. On the positive side, Ed O'Neill is amazing as Jay Pritchett. As he was in ""Married, With Children"", he's like a comedy machine, delivering every line perfectly. To sum up, Modern Family is funny and entertaining but not particularly witty and intelligent, and uses a kind of soft-edged, sentimental satire that flatters, but doesn't challenge, the audience's ability to laugh at itself."
19,"I really don't know how people say this show is good. Believe me, it's not. I wanted to see this show because of the positive reviews it has received, so I watched the pilot first. It was boring, clichéd, and annoying. Even Ed O'Neill is bland and boring, that made me sad. The normal family (Phil Dunphy) is dumb and uninspired. The gay couple is stupid and annoying. I don't have anything against gay people, but the fat one is nothing less than annoying and disgusting. The other gay is OK, but he doesn't make me laugh at all. Sofia Vergara looks too much excited, like she's hyperventilating....it's really creepy. The kids are bland or clichéd at best. After the pilot, i though ""Well, it's the pilot...maybe the second one is better...."" Well, that's not true. Everything is bland and boring at best, or annoying and unbearable at worst. The characters, the story, the comic parts. Believe me, I tried to laugh with this...I couldn't. Now for the big picture.....there is no music whatsoever. It makes you feel like you're watching a home video, maybe that's why the series is boring. And finally the worst part.....the camera....it goes up, down, left, down, up, right.....so, who gave the camera to a 15 year old drunken kid? It makes me dizzy to watch this show, and with the story and characters, it makes me sick. I can't stand watching more than 5 minutes of this ""thing"" now. So, to summarize, DO NOT watch this series, there are better things out there...in fact, almost everything could be better than THIS!"
20,"I just bought this after a friend of mine recommended it, because it was supposed to be so funny. And maybe it is, I'm sure it is for some, but not for me, here is why: not one single funny character! the gay couple i super annoying, the fat guy is supposed to be funny because he is fat and dramatic, the colombian kid, funny because he's fat and acting like a grown up, not funny! the women in the series, sexy super cliché all the time, not funny! the kids, not funny. the father (son in law of Ed..) is the most funny character, but is sometimes over acting his part. To sum it up, i find the whole family kind of irritating. They're always hanging out together (who does that!), pretty, rich and perfect family. I feel more like throwing up than to laugh. In fact I haven't laughed since episode two (I have just watched season one..)Maybe this series works for rich white happy families who recognizes them self in the ""funny family situations"", people who just had a baby and think that kids are super funny just being kids. Maye I am just a little F#%d up for needing more morally deprived series like ""its always sunny in philly"", ""peep show"" or ""trailer park boys"" to get me to laugh:) I don't like comedy series to be about ""learning something"". It reminds me of a modern ""step by step"", but even though I disliked that series for the same things, they at least had some funny characters and good dialog."
21,"The first 5 seasons of this show were as good as just about any sitcom that's been on tv. In season 5 however, it started to decline, drastically. I still watch because I've been here so long I want to finish it out, but most weeks it's painful. They 'jumped the shark' long ago, and the once hit comdedy has been on a traumatic tailspin ever since. Reading rumors as of late that the upcoming 10th season could be it's last, makes me feel somewhat, well, relieved."
22,"This show run it's course after season 3. It's basically just repeated storylines each season. God only knows why this show is still running and why the cast, whose acting is simply awful, get paid so much. 
Somebody put this show out of its misery"
23,"Much like the Roman Empire that once stood brawny and proud, this show is now worn, crumpled and ready to cave in.
I hadn't watched an episode since season 6 as I grew tired of watching the repetitive format. Just tuned in to check out season 11 and Jesus! What on earth happened?
I'll tell you: The show got milked for all it was worth, and now the cash cow is about as parched as the surface of Mars.
Season 11 Ep 2, Cam is trying to sell the viewers a smart fridge!?
Then again, this show always did love its product placement.
Sad to see it decline over the years. Should have wrapped long ago."
24,"This show is severely overrated. I admit it is occasionally funny, and the premise of the 21st century ""modern family"" is an accurate and humorous representation of today's familial diversity. However, the acting from the majority of the cast is so pretentious and falsely exalted I have to skip through the episodes on Hulu just to look for a laugh.By far, the saving grace of the show is Cameron - the lovably gay eccentric that this world needs more of. His mannerisms exhibit a delicate confidence and appreciation for life's nuances. If only Mitchell could match half of Cameron's genuine exuberance, they'd be the perfect family. Cameron remains my only real laugh instigator on the show.I'm shocked and appalled Julie Bowen won an Emmy for her indigestible supporting role. Apparently, acting like a bitchy, whiny, bossy 13-year-old is what being a mom is all about in today's modern family. She'd fit right in with the cast of Troll 2. Phil remains the only bearable flesh of the family, and even he's losing my vote lately. Gloria has blatantly been mistreating and exaggerating her ""accent"" for a laugh to the point where she's probably offending the country of Columbia. And don't get me started on the kids.Here's some advice for the producers: Replace everyone but Cameron, Manny, Jay, and Lilly. Hire some writers who know what 'subtle' and 'organic' mean. Stop giving yourselves the hype. Unless you can deliver you'll be just another rock painted gold like Lady Gaga's 'Born This Way.'"
25,"Very sad decline. What was once groundbreaking television, un-PC, and thoroughly modern, has become a social justice pablum fest. The characters have all become ridiculous, with only Jay and Phil giving us occasional flashes of the brilliance that once made the show great.Plus, it turns out none of the formerly child stars can actually act."
26,"At first when I heard the name of the TV show I was intrigued. I started watching it and man, I haven't laughed so hard in my life. I hope there will be more and more seasons to watch! And Sofia Vergara is AMAZING! Best actress EVER! I can't wait to watch the next episode! And Lily is so cute. There is a humor in every episode. I have my favorite episodes like when Lily cursed at the church, or the episode with the tornado, and there is the Halloween episode when Sofia shouted 'You put egg on my house I kill what you love'. And then there is my big thank you to the creators and the great job they had done, they are doing and the more that will come."
27,"Imitator Family steals everything bad from the last 60 years of television. From ""The Office"" it steals hurky-jerky rapid camera shifts to try to show it is ""new""; from ""I Love Lucy: it steals contrived plots that are completely unrealistic. From ""Steinfeld"" it tries to pretend it is a ""real-life"" show and thus about nothing, even though most sit-coms are about ""nothing"" and their attempt to turn them into something. And by taking plot devices from everything from ""Father Knows Best"" to ""Roseanne"" it tries to create laughs where there are none. While Ty Burrell and Eric Stonestreet play horrible stereotypes poorly, Ed O'Neill is good and Sofia Vergara is very good. However, in 10 years this series won't even be seen at 2 AM in syndication."
28,Diehard fan started from season one. Not from the US but am able to get most of the jokes. I love Gloria as her acting are very natural and funny. People say it's getting worse but for me its still above the standard.
29,"After 6 seasons it gets repetitive and annoying.
And the cringy slapstick combined with the bad acting can't support the time between the 1..2 good jokes per episode.
The quality of humor decreased over time and very hard in season six and the writers are still mostly playing the steroetype card.
First 5 seasons were OK and if you're not too demanding and usually laugh about
unintelligent humor, i recommend the show."
30,Used to like this show but the last few seasons - and the current one only continues the slide - have become stale scenarios divided into the usual personality groups where everyone tries SO hard - often having to rush their lines to get all the details out in in their allotted time slot. It looks like - and is - such hard work. When actors try this hard to be funny it just does not work. The story lines seem to get more and more unrealistic. Frankly this show is in a race with itself - to the bottom. I would have to think that the actors themselves must. Probably should have been killed a few years ago.
31,"I tried watching this few times on TV but I didn't laugh at all. The jokes were clichéd or far from funny. Boring and repetitive story line.
Some of the characters are toxic to watch. Even the kids characters...One of the worst sitcoms I've ever seen.
Why are these people some of the top paid actors nowadays in television for this show?!?But what I didn't liked most in this show was the camera work.
It gives me massive headache after only few minutes with all that fast moving and zooming in and out all the time! It's really annoying!!! Makes it unwatchable."
32,"Modern Family is an another offspring of the colossus of political correctness in American sitcoms. We have tree families who are prosperous, predominantnly white people from dreamland suburbia where the ""others"" are treated as accessories: Sofia Vergara is an over-the-top emotional trophy wife, the gay couple is conceived as representing the whole range of looks from chubby and feminine to masculine and rational. On top of it we have their adopted daughter who happens to be Vietnamese and the nerd sister. However, the most annoying of all characters by far is Phil Dumphy who is desperatelly hanging on to his Stepford Dad thing and overdoing it so many times that he more often than not turns this borderline entertaining show into a creepy family cult full of paranoid pefectionism and shameless stereotypes. All in all, this is a show that's exactly good enough to make you not switch the channel, but bad enough to regret spending time on it."
33,"I have only seen one episode, thank god. No, you aren't the only one who doesn't think this show is funny. You also aren't the only gay man offended by the stupid gay stereotypes. Not all gay men are scaredy cats. The only stereotype I saw broken was the fat gay man. They should be really modern and include a skinny lesbian. Both gay guys were afraid to stand up for themselves. Good West Side Story reference though, it still did not come off funny. That about says it all. No, they insist I drag this out! no pun intended. Obviously the episode was unmemorable or it would be easy to have ten sentences. Or even more, since apparently they cannot count. How many more do you need?"
34,"The first 2 or 3 seasons of Modern Family had a lot to offer. A strong cast, sharp wit and reasonably interesting storylines. Predictably, the show then dragged on far too long and by the end it became truly abysmal. This is not the only American sitcom to suffer this fate but there's still no excuse for it.I loved the performances from Ty Burrell and Eric Stonestreet and was always quite impressed with the child actors but beyond that the show quickly became stale and repetitive. The stereotypes around gays, Latin Americans and black people are as cringy as Phil himself. It's not that I'm a triggered snowflake or anything, it's just not very funny.5 seasons would have been acceptable, 6 at a push. But 11? Seriously? Why do they always ruin these shows like this? Anyway, there's enough to like about the early seasons but once Luke's voice drops, get out of there."
35,"I do not like too many of the newer 'comedies' (Well ""Big Bang"" is a fantastic show). This show just seems like everything is contrived and forced. I did try to watch 'Family' but kept vomiting - you all know how that is. With that in mind, questions do pop in my mind, like: Why all the awards? Good question. And Why all the hype? Another good question. People do like the show - that is obvious, so maybe I am just missing something. Wait while I ponder in deep ponderance mode. Hmmmmm, what would I do to this show to make me a fan? Let me see - a-HA! Maybe if the cast boarded a charter boat, and went on a short trip and ended up on an uncharted island. That is brilliant. Would I watch it then? Would I? Ah - nope. It is not what I am looking for and I just do not find it entertaining. Show stinks"
36,"Produced in the mockumentary style popularised by embarrassment comedies like ""The Office""[1] and ""Parks and Recreation"" this take is far too tame and restrained to work. Those other shows savage the people whose petty lives they satirise. When the mockumentary camera is used to deliver a pure sitcom in ""Modern Family"", it reveals only that banality is... banal. That is, stripped of the cruelty and gloating of embarrassment comedy, all that's on show here is a tired parade of sitcom stereotypes. And when these stereotypes extend to race and sexual orientation, the result is truly repellent.Even /had/ the writers decided to use the mockumentary style to depict the lives of these characters as empty, pathetic, and meaningless, the characters aren't even substantial enough to savage. And what would be funny about savaging stereotyped minorities anyway? The appeal of this remains unfathomable to me.[1] I'm specifically referencing the British version of the show here; I've not seen the American remake, so can't comment on it."
37,"While I enjoyed the first two seasons of MODERN FAMILY, the third is a bit tired. Very few funny lines and situations. They should have stopped while ahead. Two season would have been great. The acting is over board, even for a sit-com. The two gay characters are horrible...both the writing and the acting. Can't gay characters act like 'normal' human beigns???? They always bicker and how they've stayed together this long is beyond belief. And these guys were actually nominated for an Emmy. Who do they sleep with? Also annoying is Ty Burrel. Lousy actor in an inane role. He too was nominated?? Give me a break. Even for a sit-com, the situations for the most part are unreal. The camera work is also horrible. Trying to be like an art movie with all that hand held camera movement and zooming. Besides re-casting, they should stop with the 'fancy' camera work. After all I've said, I do enjoy the little girl who plays Lily. She's be best thing on it. Ed O'Neil also deserves some credit as he's the only one who acts with authority and humane qualities. As for Sophia, well, she's still great to look at and at times she comes through well, but stop with the screaming. As far as the kids are concerned...again, RE-CAST."
38,"It's entertaining but it's not a classic sitcom or comedy series. You won't have any laughter-sounds in the background and it's not so funny compared to classics like Love and Marriage or Simpsons but it's somehow entertaining because the plot is usually quite original. The fact that Ed O'Neil has a major role made me watch this, he's still a good actor and somehow I grew up with him. The gay guys are quite annoying sometimes. It looks a lot like they try to make it a reality TV show but it's not, just camera moves around like that. Weeks after writing this review I had the feeling to add some things I highly dislike: This series promotes a very negative type of family and is full of subliminal messages and tries to brainwash you. They always put the beauty of the 2 mothers Julie Bowen and Sofia Vergara very much in front, character is not that important it's always more about their sexiness and makes them awful role-models. The gay-guys are nice people but this series tries to force the impression on you that a gay family with adopted child can work just sooo fine. The way they behave is always so nice and so typical TV-gay and nothing how real gay people behave. What bothers me the most is the way that those children are portraited, with their very feminine way of dressing and adult-like hairstyle they try to make them look like grown up women although they are children and trying to put a sexual focus on the three girls in this series. Especially the oldest daughter has her breasts almost hanging out of her clothes for the whole series and is usually slutty without regret. Even the youngest daughter (the Asian one) looks more like she is styled up for a ""young miss Texas"" contest than just being a normal little girl. Hands away from this Hollywood-Illuminati try to brainwash you and how you look at society."
39,"It's little wonder this show was the darling of awards shows-pandering to every possible subset of the Hollywood weirdo enclave.Don't misunderstand-the first few seasons, up through about season 5, it had potential and often found itself uproarious and profoundly funny; then the lot of creators got far too big for their britches and begun jumping sharks at every opportunity- desperately trying to find the revelry it had once bathed in.Coupled with some of the absolute worst child-turned-somewhat-adult actors known to man, and it found itself the has-been comedy that just couldn't redeem itself.Too bad, had they just stuck with the formula that rose them to the top, the show could have gone out on a high note rather than the *womp womp* we're left with. Take note, Hollyweird, America is tired of your pathetic attempts to preach down when you should consider yourselves blessed to be invited into our homes in the first place."
40,No longer funny! They need to end our misery! Put everyone on an airplane and crash it!
41,"What's happened! Seasons 1 - 5 were absolutely hilarious ""Modern Family"" was the best show, one of my favourites in those seasons the writing was SO clever and the laughs were constant it genuinely was a very good show always entertaining with its ""mockumentaty"" style to it but after season 6 things obviously changed writing creativity was dropping off and the laughs weren't there anymore and seasons 7+ forget about it I'm not finding any laughter at all I hardly watch it anymore. The show had a really good run but they have dragged it on too much now and sadly have ended it poorly. If the show had been left at season 5 my rating would have been 9 - 10 stars and would have well and truly deserved each one but the older seasons have really hurt that rating they just aren't funny anymore and it's really disappointing. The kids have grown up and you just don't get the same laughs if any at all. Do yourself a favour if you're looking for a new show with lots of laughs definently watch this one watch seasons 1 - 5 and then stop! Don't ruin it for yourself I don't watch it anymore other than the odd one here and there just to see the show finish because I was so disappointed it's just boring cringe, worthy even. I'm so disappointed!! Why they felt they needed to make 10 seasons when the show had obviously lost its touch well before season 10 was been filmed and to ruin such an amazing show I'm so disappointed ""Modern Family"" I'll try to only think of your early seasons back when you were for sure worth the watch and I'll try to forget what a mess the shows become."
42,"I've only watched a few episodes from the first season, but, aside from not containing one iota of actual comedy, this is one of the most offensive shows ever created, and the writers should be castrated. One could understand if this were satire or black comedy, but it simply isn't anything, while it does succeed in offending practically every minority group on the planet, especially gays and hispanics. Instead of a real gay couple were served up with a couple of raving gay queens. Instead of a hispanic, were are treated to a modern day Carmen Miranda. But speaking as a gay person, this is the most offensive piece of garbage since Will and Grace. I know the networks have no class, talent or style in their work, but this is beyond all that. Simply pathetic!"
43,"Actually from the first to sixth season, I think it's a very genius show. Love the character. Love the story. But starting in seventh season, I think the show is not as funny as it was before. Phill is not funny but tried too hard."
44,"I gave it a good long run. Decent humor, likeable characters, okay stories. BUT, I just can't handle the falsetto hyper accented screech any longer.
Sorry, but she's easily the most annoying voice on television today."
45,"For a long time, 'Modern Family' was my favourite show on TV. I would watch an episode and it would crack me up. Each of the characters was hilarious in their own way, and the situations that they were in always made for good viewing. Seasons 1-6 are some of my favourite TV comedy, and season 7 is good enough. From that point onwards it just gets so boring.Maybe it's just the actual passage of time rather than the material going stale. As the show has gone on new characters have been born and the children have grown up. In the more recent seasons all of the characters that were children when the show started airing have just become insufferable. Lily has become an annoying hormonal teenager, Alex is an bad, Manny is irritating and both Luke and Haley are dull.The remainder of other characters have largely stayed the same, but on their own they cannot right the ship. Phil is consistently the most entertaining character, and everyone else is fine. I would argue that the show has grown stale because audiences have grown tired of seeing these same characters over and over again. The jokes just don't land like they used to.While we're here, can we mention the tease of a 'main character's death' that turned out to be a complete and utter waste of time. Now credit where credit is due: season 10 does mark something of an improvement over the previous season. That's hardly an achievement, but it's better than nothing.The later seasons have killed the series for me. I cannot be bothered to watch anymore. But don't let the negativity of this review deceive you, I really did enjoy this show for a while, but everything after season 7 isn't worth anyone's time."
46,"This show has gone downhill in the later seasons. Just watch the first 5 and enjoy, by the time you get to Seaton 10 it's become too slapstick and everyone delivers their lines too quickly. A shame but enjoy the early work."
47,"Its best times are long gone when Modern Family used to make good episodes and great seasons with smart dialogue and funny jokes. The last 3/4 seasons are just filled with lame and sarcastic jokes nonstop that make your eyes roll. Having watched this tv show from the very beginning, it's impossible not to be sad for it's closure but honestly, I'm glad it did ended since it wasn't making any sense either. It remains a tv shows that tackled serious problems in a unique and funny way and for that you should see it."
48,"I absolutely love this show. I really like every character and the development he has experienced since the beginning of the show. The show is always funny, there are so many wonderful moments. It's just so satisfying to watch the show.
A rewatch is definitely worth it, I've watched every episode at least 3 times. The cast is perfect too, there is a certain harmony between them. I'm unhappy with the ending after season 11, but I can understand it too. Hopefully there will be a big and epic ending after 22 episodes and maybe a spin-off in a few years.Btw I'm from Germany, it's really popular here.
Thanks to the Cast, Producers, Writers &Crew"
49,I love this show and I am angry as it ended. I never wanted it to end.I started binge watching it during covid-19 and this lifted my spirits whenever I felt anxious during tough times. I will re-watch it again and again but I know deep down that it's not going to be same.Family comes first . Jay Gloria Manny Joe Phil Claire Haley Alex Luke Mitchell Cam and Lilly. I will miss you guys.
50,"It started out as one of the best comedy shows I have ever seen. It keeps the steam going for some seasons, then it starts to drop and one can forgive it, because you love the characters. But season 10 is so embarrassingly bad. I loved the show in the beginning, watch the first seasons, but stop at season 9, at the latest."
51,"You know the mark of an amazing show when you can watch episodes over and over and over again and still enjoy it like it's the first time.
This timeless show is exactly that. I am a big fan of Friends and without comparing the two too much this show is for this generation what friends was from that generation.
It's a show that makes you happy, sad and gives you laughter all at the same time.
Modern Family is my happy show!"
52,"No doubt this show is entertaining and brings one into a good mood. But the more episodes I watched, the more I got irritated by the fact that the name ""Modern family"" isn't justified at all:You got three families - two of them with stay-at-home-moms and working fathers. This couldn't be more traditional. Maybe the producers thought by adding a gay couple with an adopted child and a mixed American-Colombian family, that's enough to be modern. But what they have totally forgotten is challenge the traditional gender roles of the US-American family. Judging from the rest of the reviews here, nobody even seem to notice. Which is worrying."
53,"PLEASE don't renew this series for the 2018-19 season! Better yet, cancel it immediately. The story lines are tired and silly and most of the characters are offensive. Especially the ""Gloria"" character who prances around with her fake Charro / Carmen Miranda impersonation. Hispanic women should be grossly outraged at being depicted by this stereotype (an airhead with tight-fitting clothes). And the gay guys remind me of the depiction of gay men in the 1950s - all swishy high camp. And what's with the fat one who constantly wears those shirts with those outlandish cuffs rolled back? And he's a coach? Puh-leeze! Any coach that nelly would be booted off the team in no time at all. Jay (Ed O'Neill) is the only character that makes any sense. Most of the children are untalented and downright boring."
54,"I haven't seen a ton of this show. Because what I've seen I've found to be awful. I have never liked the mockumentary style filming for comedy series. I feel annoyed by most of the characters because they seem to be charachatures filmed in a way where they are supposed to be treated as real people who are funny. It's a conflicting blend that just doesn't work for me.It doesn't make me feel relaxed and entertained. It makes me feel on-edge and annoyed while the characters try and typically fail to amuse me. I have a lot of trouble understanding why anyone likes it at all. I feel the overall story idea of multiple families all connected going about their lives is fine for a TV comedy. But I loath the style in which they present the ideas in this show. Also, young kids acting in a sitcom is usually a turn-off for me unless they are used scarcely. This show has a lot of kids utilized a lot. So that's another issue. Overall this show is a skip unless I'm with my friend of similar taste and we want to watch this show to ponder why anyone likes it."
55,"This was watchable wallpaper/background noise for many years, but the BS 'social justice' agenda pushing is just too damn thick.We get it, you're woke.You know more than half of the world think's being 'woke;' is basically the same as being born with an extra chromosome, right?Lame but watchable show ruined by the same progressive BS that ruins pretty much everything lately."
56,"I enjoyed Modern Family for several years. Not every show was top notch but most were up until 2 years ago. The 2016/2017 season was awful, not one good show in the whole season. I had hopes the 2017/2018 season would get back to the earlier quality. But this show is now unwatchable. I am embarrassed for the cast members. They are getting rich but they have to know they are producing terrible work. The storylines are tired and worn. And, is every young character going to have a borderline incestous relationship with an adult family member of the opposite sex? CBS, take back your renewal and put this show out of its and our misery."
57,"I gave this a try back when it first came out, got halfway through the first episode and turned it off. To say it seemed, shallow, clichéd and in some cases offensive to my intellect would be an understatement.A couple of years later, seeing it still running, I gave it another try, thinking it must have improved. What I saw was shallow, clichéd and offensive to my intellect.I then erased it from my mind until now, when, amazingly in its sixth season, I somehow hypnotised myself into believeing it would have got better again. I tried a recent episode. All I got was - you guessed it - a shallow, clichéd and intellect offending mess.I never made it through a complete episode, despite the presence of Ed O'Neill, who, if I'm honest, was the only reason I gave it a shot in the first place.From what I have seen of it, however, I can say that the parody of a ""Modern Family"" that they sought to portray is sadly way off the mark. It isn't a parody, it is a caricature. A badly thought-out, sometimes hideously over-acted mess that fails to elicit even the smallest of chuckles from me. Most of the time I was just staring in disbelief at the inanity of it.There isn't any clever humour in this show. Just a lot of dumb humour and stereotyping of minorities that makes you blink in surprise that anyone could find it funny.SUMMARY: Bad. Really bad! Not even train-wreck good. If I say I'd rather watch 2 Broke Girls instead, you'll understand just HOW bad!"
58,This show is awful and boring. None of it was funny the only reason I watched the first episode because everyone was saying it was good but boy were they wrong.I thought the acting was pore and the show just gets annoying after awhile. The characters that were annoying were Gloria and Phil because Phil keeps trying to say these jokes that aren't even funny and Gloria is just plain annoying and I also get sick of her voice blabbering on. I know I won't be watching this show again.Also they don't have a laugh track in the show but I think they should because then you would know when to laugh.
59,"The many critical accolades for this comedy series puzzle me. For the most part, I find it tiresome, a broadly played, cutesy attempt at a portrayal of ""contemporary life,"" replete with fairly gently insulting caricatures of gays, Latinos, precocious children, and a crusty ""colorful"" character making an attempt to adjust to his aforementioned Latina wife and her son. It follows the often used technique of rapid-fire cuts from one family interaction to the next that should appeal to those suffering from ADHD. How clever!The best I can say for ""Modern Family"" is that it is somewhat less irritating than many other current comedies, like the dismal ""How I Met Your Mother,"" the dreadful ""Two Broke Girls,"" and new lackluster efforts like ""We Are Men,"" ""Sean Saves the World,"" and ""The Millers."" The best left is the long-running ""Big Bang Theory"" which is, at least, literate and brilliantly acted.Just as television has produced a number of superb dramatic series, its comedies continue to slide into an abyss. We now have brilliant dramatic productions, mostly from basic and pay cable. Where are the comedies?"
60,"I love ""Mordern Family""! Even though, sometimes characters like Gloria, and Cam get annoying sometimes. The show is great, and now it's even better! On wensday I watched the episode where ""Larry"", the family pet, (cat, in case you were wondering) goes missing, they eventually find him, and you won't believe what Cam tells Lily. The main Characters are: Claire, Phil, Cam, Mitchell, Jay, and Gloria. Main supporting characters are: Lily, Manny, Luke, Alex, and, Haley. I hope this has no spilers, so you can enjoy, this awesome show. Other shows that you might like if ""Modern Family"" are, ""Aressted Development"" or, ""The Office"". You can get both of these on Netflix. If you don't have Netflix you're out of luck! Overall it is a great show! Catch it on Wensday nights on ABC."
61,"After Seeing so many good reviews here of this show , I struck to idea of watching "" Modern Family"" .... I seen episode 1 , which was boring,but i tried to force myself to watch more because i thought that May be ahead their will be good episodes .... But I could not bear this show ,I switched it off right in middle of episode 3 ...Again i started fresh by watching its 4th episode , but this was also boring ...so again i switched it off after watching episode 4th also ..Now i have made my mind to never watch this show again . #bad story line,bad humor,Bad Screen Play . nothing will hold u to watch further episodes of show ."
62,"This show is very clever, witty, and full of surprises. I have been a big fan for years ever since the first episode. However, Sofia V.'s role (Gloria) is becoming so annoying as a character that it is ruining the whole show. She continually whines at that crazy high pitch/volume all the time, always with the same complaints and her hypocritical attitude is almost unbearable. Please come up with a new direction for her. After years and years of speaking English, she still sounds like she immigrated last summer. I think her accent is actually getting worse. All the other characters are evolving and yet she still has the same persona as the first season."
63,"Kinda like TBBT the show went downhill after season 4. Never laughed once, maybe because i laugh in drama series, but its not my favourite, and wasn't for a long time."
64,People just want to laugh and that's all there is to it. All you to do is have some cheep laughs with boring character. On boring sets. Then all you have do is repeat the same stupid jokes with the same stupid characters over and over again. Comedy fans are not bad people. They just have interest what so ever in anything original. They just like what's marked. It is what make comedy so easy. The actors have some talent. The story lines are awful. The humor is awful. There are to many bad comedy shows that are popular. How this lasted as long as it has. And how it got and 8.6 is just something I do not get. 8.6 is just overrating it big time. The actresses in it are pretty I think at has a lot to do with it. Because it is not funny at all.
65,"I love this show but if they don't tone down Clairs character I will have to stop watching. She is ALWAYS so over the top neurotic now I cant stand her character anymore. Just take it back a few notches!!!!! I get nervous just watching her. Her actions are illogical . The other characters are true to the original characters, they have developed normally over the years and are still believable. Lilly is a great character and her lines always make me laugh, I love her attitude and Joe is a cute little boy. Manny and Luke aren't as entertaining now that they are older, Luke doesn't seem to really know how to actually act, they are going to have to address this. Mannys eccentricities were cute in a little boy but as a teenager they are annoying. If they could rework him a little it would be more believable and likable. If they could address these issues it would be the ""10"" show it used to be"
66,"All seasons were very good, but... I do think that instead of Dylan should be Andy the one who is with hayley at the end... It would be a better ending!"
67,"How have I never seen this before..... I've just got to season 3 in a couple days and wow it's so bloody good. Has had me in stitches non stop. Great cast, great acting, great story writing. So much love. I can't turn turn it off haha"
68,"I see it as an experiment in the domain of TV series. or just a challenge. because it propose old themes, from family to friendship. but it has the courage or madness/eccentricity to put this themes in a real new package. and the result is not always comfortable. first - because the limits of humor are very, very far. second - because it reflects the XXI century in the most precise manner, with its aspects of Babel Tower to the sexual minorities and parenthood, Ed O Neill and Sofia Vergara as a delicious couple and Eric Stonestreet and Jesse Tyler Ferguson in a form of chemistry who seems escaping from every rule. so, an experiment. easy to love it. more easy to criticize it. and this is not exactly a bad thing."
69,"The first few seasons were good but the show got very repetitive after that. Every season, several episodes are devoted to celebrating special days (valentines day, Christmas, Halloween, Thanksgiving, birthdays and anniversaries) and we get only 2-3 episodes per season that don't revolve around celebrating some special day. The writers must be running out of material or something."
70,"Modern Family proves once again that you can put a thin coat of shiny paint on an old, boring car and sell it as a sports-car.The show isn't necessarily terrible per se, actually it's watchable and at times even somewhat fun. Still nothing near the level of awesomeness you'd expect from something that has raked up so many awards over the years.The premise was interesting, but let's be honest, what's so ""modern"" about those families? When you scratch the surface, it's still playing all the staples (clichés?) of the traditional family sit-com.Not one but TWO incompetent husbands: Phil is the typical well-meaning, but irremediably childish, middle-aged husband whose job stability and competence is a mystery. Jay is all that, with a sprinkling of Grumpy Old Man for good measure.Claire is yet another stereotypical stay-at-home mum, whose role is only to play the fussy and shrill counterpart to Phil and the kids. And speaking of shrill, oh boy... Gloria! Could she be more one-dimensional and annoying?Things don't go much better for the gay couple either. The idea of having a straight man (sorry for the pun...) in Mitchell was OK, too bad he borders on plain dull, still retaining some of the awfully outdated traits of the typical gay man. Traits that reach the grotesque with Cameron... A flaming drama queen who overreacts at everything.Oh and the kids are, again, from the usual set of characters: the vain daughter (Haley), the brainy 'ugly duckling' (Alex), the thick boy (Luke), the sassy little girl (Lily)... Where they try to go for something unusual, they dig even further... Manny has to be the most absurd persona ever seen on TV. A preteen who acts and talks like a middle-aged man from the 50s is just beyond quirky. It's downright stupid.So, despite the contemporary spin given to the family ties (extended family, homosexuality, adoption, age difference), the core of the story and of most plots is still way too close to a standard 80s (or older) production. Situations progressively went from vaguely credible to over-the-top and gimmicky as well, as if the whole thing wasn't questionable already.It still makes for decent casual TV, but definitely not worth all the awards and praises it's been getting. The smart choice was pandering to the critics and to the cool crowds with the addition of socially relevant topics to a decades-old format. The fact those topics are either mere props or treated with little subtlety hasn't prevented Modern Family from gaining largely undeserved accolades."
71,"This once brilliant comedy has experienced a precipitous decline across the board: scripts, acting, direction. What was once fresh and hilarious about its wink-wink knowingness, has become predictable and crude. A show like ""Parks and Recreation"" remained fresh and funny for its entire run; this one, sad to say, has not. The actors SCREAM their lines, even when confiding to the camera. Sublety has gone out the window. Time to shut up the shop....."
72,"'If life gives you lemonade, make lemons and life will be all like whaaaaat?'"
73,My go to show whenever I feel down. It's funny and teaches family values. It has made me more open minded. Cam is my favourite character.
74,"What appeared to be an awesome comedy series till season 5, then lost the steam after 6th season. Similar to another tv series The big bang theory. I would have recommended this tv series for everyone. But I lost interest after season 6 started. No more comedic punches, or silly gigs or anything that made this must see tv series till season 5. Special mention to Mr Ty Burrell. He is an awesome actor . When the kids were young, this tv series was way more fun"
75,"There isn't a weak link in this ensemble cast. Ed O'Neil leads the way as Grandad Jay with Julie Bowen, Ty Burrell and Eric Stonestreet in particular producing numerous laugh out loud moments. The recurring Clive and Julianna encounters are pure comedy gold. There's also a good heart at the centre of all of this and you generally leave the show with a smile on your face and feeling a little better about the world."
76,"Wow I am blown away! This show is really good, with my hand on my heart I can say that this show is one of the funniest I watch in my Life. But not only that it teach you about family stuff and there is moment that you just want to cry with them. I really recommend it."
77,I fell in love with Modern Family when it came out. This show has like everything. The writing is very good as well as acting. Its comedic for everyone. The show starts declining in the middle of season 6. It gets boring.
78,"I watched about three episodes of this show and laughed not even once. This show is terrible, unfunny and boring.
If you want to watch a good TV comedy show, watch ""It's alway sunny in Philadelphia"". That is REAL laugh out loud funny.
Hell, even 2 Broke Girls is a million times funnier than this, and the show is very mediocre (still watchable though)."
79,"Early on this was one of my favorites. I enjoyed the characters except for Gloria as portrayed by the untalented SV.
Sometimes Ty Burrells' character was annoying but I now find him to be a buffoon and unwatchable - and even Eric's character has become annoying. The last show about them thinking they could be Hip Hop Dancers was beyond the pale. They don't know what to do with the kid's characters- especially the son -. I can bear Manny for a while but in short doses
This show has seen better days and what I find especially annoying is how the producers dupe the viewing public with a "" new season"" One new shoe every so often stuck in with endless reruns- and this is a common practice these days
with many programs.New. would somebody please put trishaw out of its misery ."
80,Modern Family is one of the most laugh out loud funny shows currently on TV right now. A lot of shows nowadays you might get 2 to 3 mild chuckles every episode but MF you have at least that many times every episode where you're literally Laughing Out Loud.Being a big Married with Children fan that I am it's nice to see Ed O'Neill get another show. Also been a big fan of Julie Bown since she was on Ed. The real scene stealer a lot of the times on this show though probably is Ty Burrell.How this show is able to juggle all 3 different smaller families within the 1 overall bigger family is very well done.
81,"I don't write many reviews, so this is gonna be short.I was unfortunately forced to watch 5 back to back episodes of this mind numbing garbage by my brother as he is a big fan and wanted to get me into it.The jokes are horrible, the characters are idiots(save for the great Ed O'neil), and the plots are painfully stupid.Skip this overrated show."
82,"Modern Family is perhaps the most underrated sitcom. When you compare it to other comedy TV shows , it is right up with them . I mean it's no 'The Office' , but it's better 'F.R.I.E.N.D.'. Modern Family is all about its fun and likeable characters. It is about how a family grows over the period of 10 years. Each character is unique and interesting in his/her own way. The show is very relatable and will make you feel good when you are having a rough day ."
83,it used to be my favorite show and i enjoyed a lot watching it. screenplay was so creative and realistic at the same time but lately ( last 2 or 3 seasons ) it's all soulless and dry like a bunch of celebrities hanging out. even the way they dress up is kinda unrealistic.
84,I can watch modern family forever and I won't get bored! Every rewatch makes me laugh as much as the first time. I am going to miss this show so much.
85,"I only started watching this show a couple of months ago, but I'm already in love with it. The jokes are hilarious, and the characters are pretty funny (and lovable, but Phil's the best..)"
86,"When I watched the first episode of Modern Family I couldn't stop. I think Modern Family is one of the best family comedy movies around. I find the actors funny. It never gets boring and I could watch this big family for hours. I find Phil ""Ty Burrell"" and Gloria ""Sofia Vergara"" the funniest and most authentic."
87,"Very fun to watch because you see that every family deals with (meaningless) conflicts and what is most important, it makes u feel like you are not alone in tough family situations - in a fun way."
88,"At first I kind of hesitated to watch this show, but turns out even their first episode managed to make me laugh. The joke wasn't flat and they didn't force it. It's the type of joke that'll make you laugh because it's stupid. AND for me, i fell in love instantly with the characters especially Phil."
89,"My favorite sitcom so far. It's smart, sweet, and unique and most importantly unpredictable. The one thing I abhor about sitcoms is when I can predict what's what the punchline is. And Modern Family avoids that completely, and what's even better, the humor is not awkward. It's just unique and full of love and sweetness, without losing the realism.The kids are realistic but funny. I love Manny and all the depth in the relationships as family. Another case where cast chemistry and great writing create a work of genius. I haven't seen anything like this comedy EVER."
90,Super funny also relatable something you can all watch as a family it's lovelly
91,Eric Stonestreet is the best part of this show! Always laughing when he is on screen!
92,"Entertaining in a modest sense and good for families watching together, but Modern Family lacks any real spark. There's little about the show that really draws you in and perhaps the writing could have been bolder rather than safe."
93,"I really really hate this show, fake rich family with no real problems that live in huge houses with new haircuts everytime you turn around, boring, stupid, can't relate to any of the annoying characters, it isn't a real representation of a modern family, but a corny smiley tv family, they never make tv shows of people living in mobile homes, only rich people, this show makes me mad, nobody cares about your ugly baby or being pregnant, you have money so shut up your going to be okay, try being pregnant and homeless with no family, that I'd watch, by the way I'm a guy, try being poor and being broke with no escape that's life, that's a modern family, i hate shows like modern family, go watch a better underrated show like strangers with candy, that show is comedy gold, so naturally it gets canceled, the best always do, don't waste your time watching modern family, its so phony"
94,"I rarely watch network television anymore, but a friend of mine convinced me to watch this. The writing is sometimes funny, hit and miss. However except for O'Neil & Stonstreet, the acting is terrible. Where do they get these people from? Gould couldn't act to save his life (Ok, he's just a kid, but STILL). And was Haley adopted? She looks nothing like the rest of the family. Maybe we'll find out in a later episode the mailman is her father.This show strives for the same comedy and edginess of Arrested Development. But it falls way short. Not because the writing is bad, but because the acting stinks and there is no chemistry."
95,"I've been watching Modern Family since the beginning, and while most TV comedies have me staring at the screen with an immobile expression (if for some reason I'm even watching), while Modern Family is good for several LOL moments each and every week.I also very much like Chuck Lorre comedies in general (i.e., 2-1/2 Men, Big Bang for two)--they're very intelligent, exceptionally well written, and quite funny. But you don't really get involved in the characters of any particular show: It's simply a view from the outside looking in, watching what's happening on screen for a very enjoyable 30 minutes each week.I find Modern Family different: the situations and story lines are often hilarious, but underneath there's still a very warm and human story, and you actually find yourself caring about the characters. For those who remember the old Mary Tyler Moore show, Modern Family has the same feeling, it's just updated for today, and a bit more sophisticated and ""real"" all around than any '80s comedy could be."
96,"Typical churned out for a quick buck American junk. Prehaps its just the first episode but I doubt it. All the characters made me feel uncomfy and I couldn't warm or relate to any of them. Wooden acting and no personality there seemed to be a lack of WELL known faces (thank god) makes you wonder why though, guess they didn't want to be seen in this garbage and who could blame them. Mind I did like the idea of putting on the calender a date to shoot that awful whiny kid pity that unlike real Americans they didn't use a real gun.I'll give it one more try but I guess I'll use the time this is on in between the Simpson's to wash the dishes"
97,"I remember when this show was tolerable. Now it is terrible!
Should have stopped it after 5 years"
98,"Most hilarious TV show there is. Wonderful mix of ethnicity in family By adding Sofia Vergara. Show does not get boring every episode has a new adventure. Along with being funny, the show teaches the hardships of family and how it is okay to not get a long some times. It shows what family is for and what they will help you get through. It also shows what it is like being in a family as a kid with three different age groups with the Dunham kids. It is a comedy all families can sit together and watch because they can relate to it. It has encouraging messages and valuable life lessons, showing that in the end you are capable and strong enough to achieve what ever you want to."
99,"Modern Family is a mockumentary about a big joint family further consisting of three families. Recently divorced Jay Pritchett(Ed O'Neill), his second wife Gloria Delgado-Pritchett(Sofia Vergara) & her son Manny Delgado(Rico Rodriguez) is the first family. Jay's daughter Claire Dunphy(Julie Bowen), her husband Phil Dunphy(Ty Burrell) & their kids Haley(Sarah Hyland), Alex(Ariel Winter) & Luke Dunphy(Nolan Gould) is the second family. Jay's son Mitchell Pritchett(Jesse Tyler Ferguson), his partner Cameron Tucker(Eric Stonestreet) & their adopted daughter Lily Tucker-Pritchett(1st & 2nd season twins Ella & Jaden Hiller, 3rd season Audrey Anderson-Emmons) is the third family.This is the most unique comedy I've watched in recent times. It's not a traditional sitcom with a laugh reel. However, it's freaking hilarious! All the members of this quirky family are funny in their own way. Each character cracks you up at some point of time or the other. This show wouldn't be the same even if one character didn't exist. All the characters share great chemistry with each other. In fact, you don't even realize that's it's just a TV show. You really believe that they are a real family. I love all the characters. However, if I had to pick just two, then, Phil & Gloria are my most favorite characters on the show. Ed O'Neill has done a brilliant job as the patriarch, Jay. Sofia Vergara has done a mind blowing job as the nagging Colombian wife, Gloria. Julie Bowen has done an awesome job as the strict wife & mom, Claire. Ty Burrell has done a bang up job as the loving but clumsy husband & dad, Phil. Jesse Tyler Ferguson is impressive as Mitchell. Eric Stonestreet has done an outstanding job as Cameron. The kids, Sarah Hyland, Ariel Winter, Nolan Gould & Rico Rodriguez are spectacular as Haley, Alex, Luke & Manny respectively. The supporting characters like Dylan(Reid Ewing) are superb as well. All in all, Modern Family is a must watch. So, sit with your family, switch on the TV & watch a show that the young, middle aged & old can relate to."
100,I've watched 6 seasons so far on netflix and there was only a single moment I laughed. Too clowny for me.
101,"The worst TV I think I have ever seen. Funny? No, just idiotic drivel."
102,"I love this show I do but I hate the character CAM. the guy is controlling, selfish, over- acting, and manipulative. his relationship with mitchell is the most toxic relationship in the whole show and it is stressing me out seeing them. I actually don't want to watch the show anymore because of how Toxic Cam is which is a shame because i love everything else about it."
103,This was funny when used occasionally and not heavy handed. Now she just comes across as unlikeable after the Paris episode.
104,This is what i call a perfect show.You may not laugh at every minute but overall you will enjoy the show. Every character is different and well executed. My personal favorite is Phil and Luke Dunphy. Phil is the delight of the show. Personally speaking he is the only one who will truly make you laugh. Ty Burrell has played the character perfectly. Only complain I have about the show is Mitchell Pritchett played by Jesse Tyler Ferguson. I don't like that character and I don't like his acting. I also love Claire Dunphy played by Julie Bowen.She is this controlling mom who has to take care of everything as her husband act like a child and has somewhat a free sprite. As far as I am concerned this my one of the best show in T.V. And I think it will surely continue for a long time.
105,"What the heck? O'neill is bad and was in Married With Children. Never like him in anything at all. This is so sad and every time I change channels and see this is on. I just want to keep going. It is not really funny, and if you think it is, you must love crude and rude jokes. I used to love comedy movies and tv but now it is just bad.This is as bad as watching reality tv but is not at all reality tv. Television is so pathetic now. I can't most of it anymore."
106,"This hilarious new show centers around three families which are interrelated through Jay Pritchett, his uptight gay son Mitchell Pritchett and his married and harried daughter Claire Dunphy. The families occasionally meet with each other at family functions, such as the meeting of Mitchell and Cameron's new baby in the first episode.The stand-outs on the show are Sofia Vergara as Jay's fiery Colombian wife of six months, Ty Burrell as the wannabe 'cool dad,' and Eric Stonestreet as Mitchell's flamboyant boyfriend.'Modern Family' mostly reminds me of a more grounded 'Arrested Development' mixed in with the documentary-style laughs of 'The Office.' Each episode has three main story lines that involve the members of each branch of the family, and unlike some multiple strand shows where some story lines get boring, this show makes them all work."
107,"I never wanted to watch this due to the title, ""Modern Family."" I thought it was about a dysfunctional 'modern family' with out-of-control and disrespectful children, and, unfit parents, who nowadays, are looked upon as funny, like in ""Shameless."" I don't see that as funny, but, as a growing and real concern.However, I was asked to watch it about a year ago, and, I was completely wrong. This is actually a very clever and well-written comedy about a very decent and close family with good kids and caring parents and adults who all help one another as any good family does.There are subtle rivalries, white lies, and, some snubbing going on...even a few minor insults; but, they are a very good and loving family...and, funny! On the other hand, if this weren't such a good family, many of the things being said could come across as mean, and, even appalling.Each character is very well developed. Each has their own special personality set just right to make interaction with one another work very well as a comedy.I'm happy that someone asked me to watch this as I now watch it every chance I get."
108,"I really tried to get into this show for its first year or two. But I was only repeatedly reminded of how much better I enjoyed the 2006 TV series, ""Sons & Daughters"".Modern Family is a bit over-earnest -- it tries too hard in its originality -- and seems to concede to too many network television requirements in order to sustain itself to a broader, pop audience. The characters are more contrived and less creative than ""Sons & Daughters"", and the strain and weight keeps the show from taking off. Forced comedy is rarely good comedy.That said, Modern Family is still a decent show. When you contrast it with most of the formulaic sitcom driven that has dominated the airwaves for the past decade, it might seem like a revelation. But it lacks the greatness, lightness, and creative flair that Sons & Daughters had. I'm still not satisfied with its derivative replacement."
109,"Wow - you rarely find television comedy this fresh and original. Okay, the settings are familiar ... and maybe a lot of the ""family"" situations but what goes on is definitely NOT what we've seen before. For one thing, one of the families is a gay couple - played not with the usual clichés but with real human complexity - and funny without the usual slurs. This show is literally dripping with talent - wonderful writing and a stunningly talented cast make for an auspicious beginning for this show. All the kid actors are amazingly talented. Ty Burrell is particularly great, already ""inhabiting"" this quirky, VERY funny character. And Julie Bowen - almost criminally gorgeous to begin with - turns out to be sublimely talented as well, giving us a fascinating and fully 4-dimensional character that dazzles in every way. What a great new arrival to prime time TV !!!"
110,"I've watched every episode many times over as i did with friends, this is as good if not better, all characters are funny and over the top loveable, from grumpy grandpa jay to super-tryer dad phil, the whole disfunctional family are a family i would love to be apart of. Add in boyfriends and neighbours, this is a comedy show of 5star quality. Long may it continue"
111,"First things first, I think this is the funniest sitcom since ""Arrested Development"", but it also dares to be heartwarming by the end of each episode. Thanks to the laser-piercing sharpness of the writing, it continually gets away with such a potentially fatal combination and has become that all-too-rare show that I schedule my otherwise hectic life around – even if the individual episodes are available on the ABC Web site hours after they air. Created by Christopher Lloyd (""Frasier"") and Steven Levitan (""The Larry Sanders Show""), the show offers a simple premise and a familiar format. It centers on the families of Jay Pritchett, his daughter Claire, and his son Mitchell, all of whom live close to each other in Los Angeles.The format is a sitcom under the guise of a mockumentary (much like Christopher Guest's best films, ""Waiting for Guffman"" and ""Best in Show""), which allows all the characters to express their honest opinions about each other, primarily exposing their personal idiosyncrasies and irritants. It's a tried-and-true approach, and in the expert hands of the writers involved, it works beautifully. Jay is the aging patriarch happily married to a much-younger Columbian spitfire of a wife, Gloria. He struggles to keep up with her energy and high-voltage temperament, while helping to raise her cherubic, pre-adolescent son, Manny, acting well beyond his tender years.Meanwhile, Jay's high-strung daughter Claire is married with three kids of her own. Her realtor husband Phil is your typical one-step-behind dad who thinks he is much cooler than he is, while Claire's control-freak tendencies are a reflex to not only his affable, conflict-avoiding nature but to her hopeless inability to push her children (especially eldest daughter Haley) away from the apparent hellion she was as a teenager. But I have to admit my favorite dynamic on the show is between Jay's lawyer son Mitchell and his flamboyant life partner Cameron, a former music teacher. Instead of focusing entirely on their same-sex relationship, the creators wisely chose to focus on them as new, overcompensating parents to their adopted Vietnamese baby, Lily. It's really easy to endear yourself to this extended family who manage to generate genuine likability through their somewhat dysfunctional nature.The fact that Claire and Phil represent the only traditional family structure of the three makes an emotionally resonant comment on the acceptance of diversity in contemporary relationships that cross cultures, generations, same-sex barriers and overseas adoptions. What's more, the point is not hammered in any moralistic manner but through shrewd characterizations, relatable personal crises, and genuinely funny, laugh-out-loud outcomes. The show is also blessed with an excellent regular cast that starts with Ed O'Neill who manages to bring curmudgeonly warmth to his Al Bundy-like bluster as Jay. At first, Sofia Vergara's Gloria bordered a bit too much on stereotype, but as her own foibles were exposed, e.g., her self-denial over her bad driving and her hypersensitivity to any misconstrued comment about her heritage, she became far more relatable. Julie Bowen could have been the show's inevitable wet-rag, but she makes Claire's often unpopular stances as the sensible mom hilarious case studies in the slow burn, the dead-eyed stare and the double-take.As Mitchell, Jesse Tyler Ferguson superbly contrasts Mitchell's elitist attitude and discomfort with public displays of affection with a deeper need to squash his ""mama's boy"" reputation. Even with such keen competition, there are two standouts in this crack ensemble. In Steve Carell-like fashion, Ty Burrell makes Phil a hilarious doofus of a dad in classic TV style, while Eric Stonestreet's Cameron is one of comedy's ingeniously lovable creations, an emotionally naked, over-the-top character who stays true to his corn-belt sensibilities. All the kid actors are great without being grating, and guest stars have turned in some stellar work. Most notable have been Shelley Long as Jay's new-age ex-wife unforgivable for ""The Incident""; Fred Wiilard as Phil's evasive, joke-alike dad in ""Travels with Scout""; and Elizabeth Banks as Cameron and Mitchell's perpetually drunk gal-pal Sal in ""Great Expectations""."
112,"This is the heir to Arrested Development. Need I say more? Fantastic!!!My favorite character is Cam. Fully developed.Least favorite character is the husband. I will miss Michael Scott from The Office, too, but come on...Manny is wonderful as the man-child.It is easily one of the best written comedies to come out in years. I would put the combined quick wit of the writers and actors who deliver the lines up with Archer. The show is a reminder that for the best filmed entertainment is TV is replacing movies for not just high quality drama a la Sopranos, Band of Brothers, etc. but also comedy. Congratulations to the cast and crew for well deserved Emmys.I hope that the show continues for many seasons."
113,"Based on the previews alone, I knew I would be watching at least the Pilot episode of ""Modern Family"". I am a big fan of the ""Office"" (especially earlier episodes) and love the format, so I had high hopes for ""Modern Family"". I am happy to report that my hopes were not let down for this show. In my opinion, this is the greatest 1st season comedy since ""the office"". I've been reading numerous articles about the show and it seems like Ty Burrell, who plays Phil, is the break out star. I hate to say this, but I think Phil is probably one of the dumbest parts of the show. His character is basically a Michael Scott rip-off and the actor seems like he is trying too hard. I basically want to say to the producers of the show: You have a really witty show with some great writing, PLEASE don't resort every week for predictable, LAME slapstick plot lines. You guys are better than that. I give them major credit though, because this show has TONS of potential. First Season review: B+"
114,"Everybody is saying that Modern Family may be a good runner up to Arrested Development. Well I disagree. And that's the beauty of having an opinion. This show is simply one of the greatest comedies I have ever seen! The characters are great, their chemistry on screen is amazing and the situations they create are just too laughable. Also, I find the dialogs brilliant and the awkward silences even better! And the quasi-Grey's Anatomy conclusions to every episode brings a real life feel to the show, which is where I think it diverts from A.D.. It has a meaning, while being outrageously funny.For me a 10 out of 10."
115,"One episode out of ten is really funny, so the rest is fillers and a way to have the storyline go different ways. And the writers find new ideas to make you laugh ten episodes later, and so on (hardly exaggerating). In-between some cool and current/retro guest stars. Which doesn't change the fact that it's awkward and not so funny the rest of the time. With the way these characters seem to do stupid and easily avoidable things all the time. Disappointing. Things took off a little different times, but it didn't last long. Not sure what to think, and how the show lasted 10 years and a half..."
116,"Nothing personal about these actors. They were fine when they were children but now that they are little adults their lack of acting skills shines bright.Nolan now does a weird thing with his voice and Rico now comes across like a clueless idiot. If the show wants to revive itself and get out of a creative coma then they should ax these two and make Cameron's sister a regular.The show was funny the first 5 years. The last 3 have been terrible. yes I know it still has its fans but so does ""Donald Trump"". The shows lack of major awards in the past few years should send a signal to the shows producers that this family in in crisis. ""Seinfeld"" & ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" were still getting major awards late in their respective runs. ""Modern Family"" isn't."
117,"Modern Family is definitely the best new comedy of our time, as proved by the numerous Emmys it has already won, both for the show itself and its actors, directors and writers. Modern Family won Outstanding Comedy Series for the past 4 consecutive years. The only show to top that number is Frasier. Even though Modern Family is my current obsession, my opinion is not swayed by this bias. It truly is the light-hearted yet deep-messaged comedy we needed.Modern Family reflects the growing image of society's families nowadays, and although it can be over-the-top diverse, at least it means it can cater to everyone's needs of relatable- ness. As the tag line suggests, it truly is one big gay, straight, multicultural, happy family. Although not every episode, most (especially season 1) episodes end with all the story lines connecting together and the whole family learning a lesson as a whole. I especially love the Voice-over by some member of the family saying something audience members can learn. It truly gives you a nice feeling inside, seeing these messages come across. Overall, Modern Family is the perfect blend of light comedy and meaningful words that the audience can embrace at their own accord."
118,"I'm not easily impressed by comedies, but I haven't seen a comedy this good since Seinfeld. In many ways I feel Modern Family is better than Seinfeld and of course, it's very different. It's one of those shows you could buy the DVD and watch again and again and enjoy it thoroughly each time.Modern Family is refreshing, warm, smart, hilariously funny, and it does not have a laugh track which is great.It has a superb cast. Just to name a few: Manny is played beautifully by Rico Rodriguez. This character is refreshing, warm and funny. It's great to see a young male character in a series who is not continually arrogant and rude. He is intelligent and wise beyond his years.I have to mention Sofia Vergara who is wonderfully vivacious and funny. Eric Stonestreet is just hilarious. The whole cast is wonderful. I'm glad to see the gay characters being given equal time and are not just someone's sidekick nor are they just token characters as is often the case with all mainstream comedies and shows today. It's also good to see that many of the cast are just average looking everyday people.When so many comedies today are so tepid today and such a waste of time and money, this one is stellar. I could go on and on about this show and how good it is. I have only seen the 1st series, but if future series are anything like the first one, I can hardly wait. The show leaves one feeling good. I hope it has a long run."
119,"Great,Sensible and Awesome timing Comedy with Best Casting Ever...
Best Part is the ending of ever episode where they conclude with a Good Moral Values for Life and Relations in Modern Family...
Hats off for the Writers for there Best lines with beautiful screenplay.
All Artist's Maintains great bonding with each other as perfect family and there eye-contact towards viewers will make you feel like there neighbors.
This is the First US TV show i saw, felt really bad when they Ended it....
""If this Show Doesn't go for 10 Years,Then i don't know what I'm doing in the Show business"" - Ed O'Neill(Jay Pritchett) When They Started this Series.
Guess what..!!!!!!!!!!!!
He is 1000% Right int the End..."
120,"Starts out hot, some of the middle seasons get a little boring, but the last few seasons really picks it back up"
121,"This show didn't get my attention first when I saw it on Comedy Central, but once I started watching it from the first episode I fell in love with it. The characters are great, the script is full of absurd and cringy situations, the writers are brilliant. And I like how Ed O'Neill's character, Jay is so different from Al Bundy. If you're looking for an actually funny comedy experience with lot's of laughs, look no more, you found it."
122,"Modern Family hit the ground running as a unique, sharp and witty show. It didn't have the standard laugh track and got the audience to react to what they thought was funny. The unique and modern characters and their interactions made for some good laughs here and there. Despite its decent start the show proved it was not sustainable and fallen off the radar over the years. It is not what it used to be and sometimes tries too hard. It has gotten to the stage in its life cycle where only its devoted fan base tune in."
123,"I would like to start off by saying that I can see why some people have a problem getting into this sitcom... I didn't immediately fall in love with it. I do believe it is not everyones cup of tea! Having said that I do suggest people give it a chance and watch a few episodes before passing judgement! It gives both ends of the spectrum. There are some 'silly' moments that make you chuckle and laugh, but there are also some subtle jokes. The difference is the 'silly' moments are well executed. When I watch some shows that take the 'silly' approach to comedy, I see how easy it is to take it over the top, and for me that takes something away from the show. Of course it is similar with the subtle humour. It is easy to lose an audience if all you throw at them is dry subtle humour. Its about finding a balance, and I think Modern Family does this well.There are a couple of characters that are like mar-mite, and its not very often you find a show where you love ALL the characters. Having said that, every character has their own 'thing', and the more you learn about the different characters identities, the funnier they become. I also love the fact that parts are shot in a documentary style. It gives a more realistic and intimate feel that works very well with the theme of 'family'.I could go on and talk about how well written it is and how it is one of my favourite shows and such but I think it is better you just all give it a go for yourselves! And remember, give it a chance! I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did!"
124,"Modern family is the perfect family T.V series that is loved by everyone. It combines humour and the every day crises' in the family. It is also something new and different to the regular T.V series'. There are 3 families in the show. Jay (mitchelle's and Claire's father) and his new young Columbia wife Gloria and her son Manny. Then there is Claire's family which consists of her husband Phil and there 3 kids Hailey, Alex and the youngest Luke. last family is Mitchelle's family which is one of the newest families. Cameron Mitchelle and there Asian daughter Lily.Together they are extremely hilarious including Gloria and her Colombian accent. Must watch show!!"
125,"Albeit most TV families have no relation in real life but this show grotesquely flaunts interracial ""adoption"" which actually tend to be illegal kidnappings.The thought of a TV series with a title ""Modern Family"" (which is a cool idea) promoting illegal adoption and such -- you have no idea what you are doing, put it that way. Keep it a clean family and I can go for it. Trust me, it's not funny.I do support the gay couple having a family. There are options today that you should defend -- idiots like to steal babies, your babies. Because you are gay or something. You should make them your babies. Our society doesn't actually let people walk around with someone else's kids and you should be so lucky."
126,"This show was seriously one of the best prime time comedies ever for maybe 4 seasons. That's only reason I rated this a 4. Everything was great, seemed original, it was funny, and everyone looked forward to watching it. Then it started to become a drag. Storylines would build up with great expectations only to fizzle out and go nowhere. Most of the kid actors grew up and became unfunny and cringeworthy. Plot lines and punchlines became so played out and repetitive eventually the show became intolerable to even watch. If you have never seen this show (dunno how because reruns are everywhere) stop watching after season 5 or you'll begin to hate anything to do with this show. I skipped many episodes of later seasons and eventually stopped recording it because it was that bad. I did watch the finale and even that was terrible. They really beat a dead horse with this one. Instead of milking every penny out of it, they should have shortened the seasons to focus more on content and not so much meaningless filler. Seriously went from vip to the dumpster."
127,"Don't have second thoughts about watching it, just go for it. A classic!"
128,Consistently good writing and acting. The timing in this soon to end series was impeccable. Sad to see it go.
129,This sitcom makes me laugh my head off! Would recommend!
130,"I absolutely love this show. I really like every character and the development he has experienced since the beginning of the show. The show is always funny, there are so many wonderful moments. It's just so satisfying to watch the show. A rewatch is definitely worth it, I've watched every episode at least 3 times. The cast is perfect too, there is a certain harmony between them. I'm unhappy with the ending after season 11, but I can understand it too. Hopefully there will be a big and epic ending after 22 episodes and maybe a spin-off in a few years.Btw I'm from Germany, it's really popular here."
131,"Makes me laugh so hard, I love the characters, so funny!"
132,One of the best shows ever with laughter every second from every episode from every season Phil one of the fathers on the show is one of the funniest characters in television history he's loving and comforting but also hilarious and dumb at times overall great show that's very well written with great acting
133,"Modern Family centres on the lives and trials and tribulations of family life about three Interconnected families led by Jay Pritchett played by Ed O Neil from Tv's '' Married with Children"".I think this was a great show,In It's early days with some strong messages about the Importance of Family but like so many shows It has made the mistake of running on to long and therefore rehashing alot of the same Ideas.However In saying that the Acting Is top knotch, all of the Actors are so believable In the roles you would think the were a real family.The writing Is witty and Incisive without getting bogged down In sentimentality.So overall I would recommend this show Particularly (seasons 1 - 5) which In my opinion has some of the best writing and acting, I have ever seen In any Sitcom excluding Frasier."
134,Modern family is one of the best comedies on tv and is a very enjoyable show to watch. The cast is amazing and the comedy is great. Sadly the series is in its last season at the moment but we have been lucky enough to have 11 seasons of this terrific show. I strongly recommend everyone to go and watch this series.
135,"This isn't a bad show by no means, but its not great either. Its more of a time killer than anything else. I can't really explain what's wrong with it, maybe its the whole principle. Yes its modern family so everything has to be modern but i for one don't like that. Everything is modern just like in any other home and all of the kids are ""modern"" as well, just like in any other home. To me its more of a really show than a sitcom. Most of the stuff they do i do too, and the stuff that's supposed to be funny isn't, for me. There is something missing and i just don't know what that is but the atmosphere of the whole show just don't feel right, it doesn't feel like a loving family that cares about each other they all seem fake. Just like in real life. So basically i find this more of a meta show than a sitcom, making fun of the entire world basically. But this is my opinion and opinions are subjective"
136,"A really funny & good show, until the last two seasons..."
137,"This show is truly incredible! I've grown up with this show and watching it all my life, it mean s so much to me. Modern Family tells the story of an average family trying to work out their everyday lives. What isn't included in that description is the amount of heartwarming, beautiful undertones that lie in the show. Additionally, it will make you laugh hysterically as it has never seized so amuse me. I promise you-you'll be sobbing during the finale. Do yourself a favor and watch Modern Family!!"
138,Just started watching this masterpiece last night and I am already going gaga over it. The best part - there are no laugh tracks !
139,Absolutely to not be missed. Each actor has his special character. Gloria is just great.
140,"This series tells the life of three different families trying to survive all the adversities of life, and with this premise it may sound like a typical comedy without much to highlight, but the brilliant writing and the wonderful acting have made it one of the series winners. winning the Emmy for best comedy 8 years in a row.The first 4 seasons of this series, which are insanely good, just lay the groundwork for what's to come. Seasons 5, 6 and 7 are among the best that has ever been and will be on television. With ideas that have never been seen before with a wonderful performance and an incredibly well written story that ties these three seasons together as one great and wonderful work of art. And then follows Season 8 returning to the first four episode format, with wonderful episodes that continue to be and will forever be comedy classics.Seasons 9 and 10 were the series' low period. In those seasons, I can count how many episodes were good, but those standout episodes are amazing but it shows that they didn't have as many ideas as before and the show was about to be canceled, but season 11 came with only 18. episodes, but each one of them was unbelievably good. The finale feels a bit rushed, but everything else about the final season was wonderful and it felt like it brought in some clever writing that gave them so many awards once again.This series is one of the best that exists in the history of comedies and will remain as a classic that you can visit several times and relive the incredible adventures that these characters had for more than 11 years.The. Best. Show. Ever."
141,This is simply the best TV Show since Friends!!!! Simply incredible. I'm going to miss the whole family!!!
142,"We're to start!!! If you have not seen or heard of modern family you are living under a shell. It is one of the most funniest and most loved show, so watch it now!!!!!!!!"
143,It's one of the greatest and funniest Tv shows I have ever seen.
144,"A funny comedy that the whole family can watch. Very well acted, with great writing. The characters are all relatable and my family loved it. While TV shows seem to be getting worse ( and more woke by the day) this show has some old fashion humour with some modern twists. A great show that leaves out politics ( left and right) and just entertains."
145,"Didn't like second part of the finale but first was simply perfect. Some tears run down my cheek at some point, really moving. Will love that scene between Luke and Phil and the basketball, best of the show in my opinion."
146,Awesome show to binge watch. The chemistry in the family shown is a brilliant creation.
147,"Modern Family is a show that grows over time. The first couple of seasons may not be that good but if you stick with it you become a member of this awesome family. At the end of 11 seasons, it is one of the few shows that I really attached to. Definitly one to watch"
148,"Every episode is very loving, no matter how quarrel and unhappy, the family members can still unite. Each character is so distinctive and likable."
149,Great sitcom about a modern family in America going about their everyday lives very funny series goes off the rails after serious 5 but worth watching guarantee laugh's.
150,All the characters are amazing in acting the best of their roles. I love Mitchel mocking every now and then in the funniest way possible. Phil is so amazing being a husband and a dad. (Y) like like like... :D :D
151,"I don't understand why a scripted sitcom use reality tv style camera work. We now have image stabilization technology for a reason, to make videos stable so that you can focus on the content. I tried getting over it and focusing on the content, but it just looked cringey enough that I do not watch this show anymore."
152,"There is just about nothing wrong w/this show. It is hilarious & very rarely do you ever find such an absolutely perfect cast. Sometimes you see good shows that have the wrong cast spewing out the lines, this show does not have any of that. Each week they just keep getting better & better every single week they just merge better & better as a completely believable family. The cast is fantastic as a whole but I have to say that the three that really standout are (in order of the quality) Rico Rodriguez as Manny, (Ed O'Neil's Stepkid) Ty Burrell as Phil, & Eric Stonestreet as Cam. I love Ty Burrell as Phil but we have seen him in things before, however you've probably never seen Ric Rodriguez before & he is absolutely brilliant in his role. As far as the comedy goes there are so many zingers that fit perfectly in the story being told that week, that DVR's were made for shows like this. One of the best things about this show is the absence of a laugh track. It makes it that much more genuine & truly funny. If you haven't seen at least a few episodes (No one episode is not enough to truly gauge this show) you don't know what you are missing. My only worry is that the quality will go down, but the way the First season has played out, I'm not too worried. Plus the cast is just getting more and more comfortable together. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because I feel that there should be more of the interaction between the whole family instead of focusing so much on the core families. However that is my only minor complaint & if they don't add that, It won't change my opinion on the overall quality of the show. Give it a try & you will be happy you did."
153,"Modern Family is simply addictive it's so good. The writers have explored a multitude of topics related to the titular ""modern family"" with amazing success. Gay couple, foreign born wife, three completely different kids. Every episode manages to touch our lives through their lives and make us laugh, cry, and tune in again and again. There are fights, misunderstandings, love, devotion, mishaps, and triumphs. Sometimes (rarely) it is not as ""comedic"" as one would expect, but it is never boring. The entire cast has amazing skills and I can't single any one in particular that is better than the other. Each character is played superbly and works in tandem with others. This show receives many praises and deservedly so. Keep it up!"
154,"This is a great show all in all, a joy to watch.. I like the main family (the father), he marries this loud Latina, lives with her passionate little boy, Manny. The three of them create quite a hilarious family with a lot of laugh. Then comes the son's (gay partnership) family, you can almost feel the normality of this arrangement and somehow forget that gay partnership arrangement used to be a taboo, I am glad that they set it up like this rather than the conventional husband-wife scenario. These guys are funny. They complement each other very well.. then there is the Dunphy family, I like father Dunply, he is the best comedian of all the Dunphys follow by his little boy the only casting I am not convince is Sarah Hyland as Haley, I don't know, just feel that maybe someone taller and older could better play the character especially since Haley does nothing but keep chasing after boys and she wears too much make-up too."
155,"Just a quick summary on the TV series: Modern Family is about a three families intertwining their lives in a comedic way. Firstly, I am in love with this. Modern Family is genius and deserves way more awards then it has. The ""mockumentary"" film style is very interesting as well. The acting from Ed O'Niell, Julie Bowman, Ty Burrell, Sofía Vergara, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Eric Stonestreet. And especially from the children actors, Rico Rodriguez, Nolan Gould, Sarah Hyland and Ariel Winter is brilliant. They really do show an authentic way of seeing family life and the actors do give that justice as well. The ""to camera"" interviews and conversations closely resemble the UK's ""the office"" but is sill very, very funny and suit the story line for that episode.Whilst watching this, I realized I was actually, genuinely laughing out loud, which not many TV series or comedy films do.Great acting, hilarious stories, smartly filmed and just plain funny. Seriously recommend this."
156,"Modern Family is a real treat for all sitcom fans of many ages and interests.Here's why:* it's never mean-spirited, always heartwarming, despite the flaws of each character
* Nerds get Phil, Alex and Manny - quite a lot for a show that doesn't try to compete with Big Bang Theory
* the LGBTQ theme of Cam and Mitch is fun with stereotypes without being offensive, also without being preachy
* the same goes for Gloria - Sofia Vergara is just hilarious.
* you get grumpy Ed O'Neill - what can go wrong!
* every episode has a nice lesson learned
* lots of movie references and fun seasonal episodes (Halloween!)
* there are absolutely no glitches in the tone of the seriesI can't understand why people hate the later seasons. Apart from the kids being older, you get exactly what started in Season One.9/10 - one point lost because of the use of babies and toddlers on screen who more than once look like they are uncomfortable. I know it's a family sitcom but I had to cringe a few times."
157,"The more I see 'Modern Family', the more I fall in love with 'Life In Pieces'. Modern Family is horrible, boring, unrealistic, unbearable at times. Very overrated."
158,"Watching Modern Family is so much fun! The actors are great. Ed O'Neill plays a great role as the grandfather and the chief of the family. Ty Burrell (Phil Dunphy) plays the childish father of the family and so are his jokes. The story is really funny and it get's me laughing everytime. Besides all the jokes there's still a plotline. You really feel for the characters and it's interesting to see their development. Each character has it's own special personality which makes it even more interesting to follow their development.The ""Modern Family"" shows a modern American family and can sometimes really be associated with the real world. There are a lot of little troubles in the family but in the end you're still one big family.I'm happy that i started to watch this series because now i watch it every chance i get."
159,"The first 3 series were well written, even witty, in spite of the awful shrieking performance of Sofia Vergara, an appalling stereotype of a Latina if ever there was one.By series 5 it has hit the shark tank and crashed. The young boys (12, 13?) sexualized and misogynistic, rating girls by appearance only aided and abetted by all the adults around them and the young daughter (6?) evaluating young boys in her class through the same lens encouraged by every adult in her circle.The awards astonish me. I can understand the first few but not the later ones.I rated it 5 because of my enjoyment of a fresh new series at the beginning but it's well past its sell by date now and calcification has set in, it has lost any originality and wit and veers so far into slapstick and unreality that it can't even engender a tired smile. Offensive to just about everyone.5/10"
160,"I can's stop enjoying this show... i just want it more and more this is a brilliant comedy from Steven Levitan and Christopher Lloyd... it's very complete, you got to laugh and you it's teach you what is the real meaning of a family.... The jokes is fresh, the cast is perfect,when i watch this, i can't stop laughing, and even after i watched this.. in this show everybody have their own things, like Phil dunphy, who always trying to be a cool dad and funny husband, but he isn't. and he's trying so hard to make it happen and it end up very fun to watch, for us.. Sofia vergara, wow... she's hot... i just can't take my eyes of her, and every time she talks... her accent just make me laugh.... i was hoping someday i will have a family like this, funny, close to each other, and full of lovemust watch this! i'm sorry if my English is not really good"
161,"Another mockumentary, but it's brilliantly done. It kind of has the feel of the interview sessions from The Office mixed in with the family humor and somewhat similar dysfunction of Arrested Development.This series has great actors and the show is rather light and laid-back. It isn't as heart-felt as Scrubs was, but it's an easy watch with great dialogue and inventive situations.The title is perfectly fitting to the series, it's about modern families. Each family (three in total) is connected to the other and the stories always have a relevant meaning.You shouldn't miss out on this show! You will need to pay attention to understand many parts, but it's an easy series to watch, especially if you watch it over the weekend with popcorn.Enjoy it, it's Modern Family."
162,"This is not a feel good series anymore. Season 1-7 was great!. But season 8-9 is all about tradigy, bad jokes, real life that we dont want to see. Its ennough to live the real life ourselfs."
163,"In the pantheon of great television comedies aired in the last fifty years, ""Modern Family"" is a notable standout. Part of that is due to the great scripts, with their interwoven stories, machine-gun timing, and character-wise references. The other primary factor is the cast, which displays a mastery of all comic traditions. This is a true ensemble show, so I hate to single out any one talent, but Julie Bowen deserves special recognition among this group of comedians.I think the true test of a great comedy is the number of laugh-out-loud moments and ""Modern Family"" is packed with them. In fact, it compares favorably with the script of any comedy film in terms of humor and cleverness.Each of the characters has its comedic niches, based upon its personality traits and neuroses. When combined, they create a family that is loving and hilarious. I have seen most episodes more than once--a practice I reserve for only the best shows (like ""Seinfeld"" or ""Frasier""). I hope this show last many more years."
164,"I caught a few minutes of this show by accident with it being on directly before a show I was going to watch. What a pile of sh**. Boring and fake. I have no idea how this scores so highly on ImDb, I was very surprised.I recommend avoiding this. The biggest loaf of cr@p I have seen in a good while."
165,"Entertaining, sweet, light-hearted and funny. Some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments in many episodes. It actually got better with each season! I'm blown away with the writing and the characters. The chemistry between the cast members is so enjoyable as well. So many hidden jokes and ridiculous moments that keep it original. Love this show; will be really sad to see it end."
166,"This show is about 3 linked families - patriarch Jay (Ed O'Neill), his young and beautiful second wife, Gloria (Sofia Vergara), her son, Manny (Rico Rodriguez), and following that is Claire (Julie Bowen), Jay's daughter from his first marriage, Phil (Ty Burrell), her husband, and their 3 children Haley (Sarah Hyland), Alex (Ariel Winter) and Luke (Nolan Gould). There's also Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson), Claire's brother, his husband, Cam (Eric Stonestreet) and their adopted daughter, Lily (Sorry, Idk who plays Lily). I'll start out with my favorite characters: Phil - I honestly love Phil. Even though he's a little goofy and somewhat dim, he's one of the nicest people you can imagine, exactly the kind of person I wish I knew. He tries so hard to be accepted, despite being kind of a geek (but a lovable one).Jay - Jay reminds me of my dad - seems a bit obnoxious at first, but he cares deeply for his family and will do anything for them.Mitchell - he's a bit bossy but he has some of the funniest lines.Manny - he's an odd mix between Joey and Ross from Friends - like Ross, he's smart but terrible with social situations and is very kind. But, like Joey, he's obsessed with women and is something of a womanizer. His advice is often terrible but he's willing to do what he can to help out.Andy - The male nanny and Haley's new boyfriend. Like Phil, he's one of the nicest people you know, and he cares about everyone around him to eternity.Characters I feel indifferent about: Alex - I like Alex, but she's a bit of a smarta*s. Normally, I think that's kind of funny, but she should tone it down just a little.Luke - he's okay. He's like Phil, but less nice (he's not mean, per se, but he's not as cuddly and loving as his dad). Sometimes he makes me laugh though.Cam - he's very loving but also dramatic and over the top, and he tends to overreact in pretty much every situation. He does have his moments.Haley - She's kind of spoiled, but sometimes she shows moments of caring. Plus, she's hot (give me a break, I'm 16!) Characters I hate: Claire - she's selfish, arrogant, and just plain mean-spirited. She's even bossier than Mitchell, and she's almost always mean to everyone, often for no reason. She also has to prove she's right about everything, and is often willing to destroy something important to Phil or the kids. She doesn't deserve any of the things she has, and I wish Phil would leave her. One time, she spied on the kids, and they all got mad at her and she told them to suck it up and that's what parents do, when she had no right to be angry at all and no one in real life would tolerate that kind of unacceptable behavior. (before I get attacked, let me just say that I have nothing against Julie Bowen, she seems very nice and is a great actress, I just really hate Claire) Pepper - Cam and Mitchell's other homosexual friend. He's incredibly obnoxious, whiny, and rude. He can't take it when things don't go his way, and he's even more dramatic than Cam. Honestly, why are they even friends with him?!?"
167,"If the Office and Arrested Development had a love child ==> This would be it!I like the way the show is directed...its almost Arrested Development- esquire (My favorite show ever). It is definitely my favorite New TV show this season. The characters are distinct and really funny. Also doesn't hurt that The gorgeous Julie Bowen and Sofia Vergara are in it; Eye Candy. Although this show is kinda cheesy but in a good way; There's always a Benign ending with the family coming together. Phil's character is probably my favurite..Ty Burrell is hilarious!While it is not a substitute for AD fans, it is as close as TV show can get. Arrested Development fans have something to watch now.I'm addicted to the show! You should be too!"
168,"This show consists of great actors who are very talented individually. Each one is able to embody their roles and as an audience you can really feel and relate to the characters. The show is very funny, light, family-oriented and what I kike best is how it tackles social issues and actually present life lessons in every episode ending. Give it a try and you will get addicted to every episode you watch!"
169,"Wouldn't it have been great if the characters were composed of more of the old Married with Children episodes, not only with just Ed O'Niell but a progression of the show where Ed O'Niell is Al Bundy who won the lottery, retired and divorced his wife, father of Kelly and Bud. Kelly is a housewife, mother and Bud is in love with his boyfriend who just adopted an Asian baby. Al's ex-wife Peggy lives in Europe with her new rich husband and Al is remarried to a young woman who also has a son. This would've made the show a great success from the very beginning if Fox had come up with the show instead of ABC, just bringing back a modern version of Married with Children would've brought in a lot of viewers."
170,"I love this TV Show, it's so funny!I watch the same episodes over and over again, and it never gets old.The Story is great, and the show is so funny."
171,"We stopped watching TV shows(with the exception of Psych and Hannah Montana) several years ago for the lack of entertainment value. You know what they say, you never get your time back. This show is worth every second. It defies boundaries yet pokes light fun of cross generational, racial, and gender issues. It makes it all okay, which brings back the ties to being a healthy family unit, no matter what the differences are.The timing/acting is well done.Does the camera person have a boob fixation?...oh...maybe I'm too close to the screen(I am watching it here on the IMDb Hulu thing).Thanks for the entertainment. Looking forward to Wednesdays."
172,This show is high on my list of favourites on TV at the moment. The humour is just so unique that you can't help but find yourself giggling about the experience hours after seeing it. The links between the families are very clever and it will really make you smile and I love the fact that it seems that you can slot your family into this programme in one form or another!I think that the gay couple storyline has got to be my favourite with hilarious quotes and situations that make you really laugh out loud. A must see for all ages. The only drawback that I can see with this programme is that its only 30 minutes long! It leaves me gagging for more and that's the only reason why it didn't get 10 out of 10.
173,"All I have to say is ""Wow."" I just caught my first episode, and even though I've never seen the show, I found it humorous and very easy to get into. ABC definitely has a hit with this show on their plate, that's for sure. It's absolutely hilarious. With it's take on the modern semi-dysfunctional family, it's just realistic enough to be enjoyed by most people, but there is an air of surrealism (in my opinion) that makes it all that more enjoyable. I also like that it's only a half an hour in total, you don't find too many truly humorous and enjoyable shows (well, I guess you find some) that are short enough that you don't feel like you've just wasted an hour. I would definitely recommend this show to my friends, family, and coworkers!"
174,"this is shot in a mockumentary style, and i loved it. it's very reminiscent of Christopher Guest's films, so if you love Best in Show, For Your consideration, then give this show a look, you'd like it.it pretty much condensed the families into several archetypes: the gay couple adopting an Asian baby, the older wealthy man with a younger foreign wife, the ""cool"" neo-American young couple.while i doubt that they will weave complex plot lines, watching the interactions between the family members with their surrounding, and their family dynamic is fascinating enough.i enjoyed it. i recommend people to watch it."
175,"Modern family is about just that, a modern family warts and all. You have the old fashioned patriarch but not so old fashioned that he hasn't snagged himself a Columbian trophy wife with her precocious over-mothered son, the two grown children one gay in a partnership with a theatrical sometimes clown, and their adopted baby, and the other married to a big kid - ex male cheerleader - and their three children (party-girl, brainbox and airhead respectively). The program is filmed mockumentary style with talking-head style comments to camera, but also breaking the fourth wall during the action bits which is usually timed to perfection for maximum laughs Observational and incredibly witty, silly and mocking of just about everything, Modern Family is hilarious and one of the best sitcoms on TV today. It's adult in it's themes but isn't gratuitous or resort to bad language, it relies mainly on the screen presence of its talented actors and very physical humour generally. I would say it was family viewing if the family were a little older, or much would go over a younger person's head. Steven Levitan and Christopher Lloyd, the writers, pitch their comedy perfectly and every script is flawlessly written - certainly one of the more intelligent sitcoms around - and deserve every new series and award they win. All the actors are great in their particular roles but interactions with Sofia Vergara (the stunning Gloria) or Eric Stonestreet (Cameron) or Ty Burrell (Phil) are my favourites. One of the funniest things I've ever seen on TV was the ""ice-dance"" in the car park between brother and sister Claire and Mitchell. Enjoy"
176,"I liked watching this one. The cast is great. Ed O'Neill certainly isn't Al Bundy in here, even though once a while he still has chance to put up the stupid face he perfected in so many ""Married with Kids""-episodes. What actually surprised me is how good the kids act. My favorites are Rico Rodriguez as Manny and Ariel Winter as Alex, which deliver their lines perfectly. They outperform their TV-parents in pretty much every moment! I welcomed the inclusion of a gay couple, but it was very stereotypical for my taste. Eric Stonestreet is ""La cage aux folles"" all over again and he isn't blessed with his script. Only Jesse Tyler Ferguson manages to keep it real once in a while as the more down-to-earth in the relationship, still the screaming, worrying and squeaking is layered a bit thick here. Less would have been more here.The screenplay feels forced and predictable once in a while. Especially in the first season the writers seemed to have a hard time make their protagonists quirks believable, which are responsible for the humor. Most of all Julie Bowen and Ty Burrell seemed to be skeptical of some ideas of their roles, which is most feel-able in the first role-play-sex-episode. Phil Dunphy being such a perfect charming seducer with almost Bond-qualities seemed to openly contradict his character definition as the clumsy but lovable family dad, even though the actor sure pulls it off acting-wise. If that guy possesses such social finesse, it's hard to accept he gets in trouble with his wife that often...The second season works better, the writers and the cast seem more comfortable with their roles. This at least gives me quite some faith the series might develop into a real gem. At least two episodes here made me laugh hysterically and that's worth quite something!"
177,"Now that season 2's over and I've seen every episode except one, I think the time is right to write a review on the series Modern Family. Following Arrested Development and The Office, Modern Family is a mockumentary TV show. But instead of ripping off AD it manages to establish its own voice early with a string of characters more down-to-earth but still funny in their own right. There weren't enough great episodes for me to bump my rating to a 9, but I never felt this show dipped below a certain quality. The dialogue is not dependent on pop culture references, bathroom humour or a laugh track, giving this show an advantage.Modern Family is intelligently put together, often by having three different stories sharing a motif reflected in the episode title. Some of the best episodes, particularly in season 1, have the characters giving commentary that can be touching. I do like most of the characters, including Alex, even if she's an imitation of Lisa Simpson, and Phil, even if the dumb sitcom dad has been done before on other shows. There's no denying Gloria is beautiful and Jay is played well by Ed O'Neill, even though I was never a big fan of him in Married with Children. Of the three branches of the family, my favourite is the Dunphys.The best episodes, I think, are Coal Digger (season 1) and Caught in the Act (season 2). Here's hoping for a good season 3!"
178,"Seasons 1-6/7 of this show were a masterclass in comedy. Such well written characters that were not only loveable but hilarious. Sure, the later seasons weren't loving up to the same incredibly high standards that the first had set, but even at its worst points it was still a charming show. At the final episode you cannot help but feel emotional as it's the end of a legacy. This show will always be special."
179,"I have seen the show two times, and I sometimes watch random episodes. This is truly a masterpiece of a show! Everything with it is perfect, from casting to intro song! Every character is relatable in some way or another, wich makes you kind of getting everyone's side in arguments!"
180,This show is hilarious. It has kept me laughing all 10 seasons long. It had some lesser moments but every show has lesser seasons and greater ones. However I still love this show and I will never get tired of watching it.
181,Cameron and Phil are hilarious! Great family show based on humor and love. Good job ABC.
182,Amazing take on the weird things happening between the family members....love binge watching the show...
183,"Family is what you make of it and have the guts to laugh at everyone's imperfections. I thought I would never be able to laugh out loud again after Friends ended but thanks to MF, I am doing this all over again. 
Just when you think one family is funnier than the other, bang! Surprise laughs!
The writers of this show have to be commended for their on-going smart family dynamics and how there is a funny side to everything.
This show and ""Fresh of the Boat"" are my favourite comedies on air at the moment."
184,"I feel good watching modern family. They are the family I dream I had. I can´t wait for the next episode and see what the kids will become, which carriers they will choose and who they will end up with. Really funny lines, word-plays. I really recommend it!"
185,This Is One Of The Best Comedy Shows Of This Generation. Right From The First Episode I'm Hooked Into This Show. This Show Shows The Average American Family And Its Joys And Hardships Complemented With Humor. The Actors Are All Very Well Suited For Their Roles. I'm Sure You'll Agree With Me That This Is The Best Show To Watch With Your Family.The Extra Scenes Where The Characters Talk To The Camera Add A Interview Kinda Feel To The Show And I Always Find Those Parts Funny !! Never Have I Felt A Family Show More Addicting And Great(As I Mostly Watch Some Thrillers And Dramas). All In All Its An Awesome Show With An Awesome Cast. Don't Miss This One Guys.
186,No more words needed.I cant even choose whos the funniest one. I love everyone. Best authentic show ever!!!
187,"Modern family is the best show I have watched for a while! I'm a tough man to please, but I've only watched the first 7 series, so my review could change quickly!"
188,"The classic of Friends lies in friendship, and the classic of modern family lies in the tolerance of family, both of which are heart-warming rays for lonely life. Ten years later, gay marriage and marriage between young and old are no longer modern, but fortunately, we always understand that love and tolerance is a new special bond in a family."
189,"I still remember when I opened the first season a few years ago, I felt that this drama was inexplicable, like a documentary, how can I still sit down and talk to the audience.
I also remember that after watching a few episodes, I feel that each episode is a routine, and every family has a variety of problems, and then panic and hurriedly solve the problem, and use the love to generate various kinds of coincidences and magical reunion At the end, the soul chicken soup ends.
But I still fell in love with this big family. As a person with very, very low tear points, I might be moved to cry for half of the episodes.
In this big family, everyone respects each other and truly loves each other. My American relatives have subtly influenced me. The current mode of equality between me and my family must have a contribution to the modern family.
After watching everyone's departure today, I am also alone in the next chapter of leaving my parents. I hope to embrace research like Alex, hope to be as confident as Lily, Claire, Gloria and Heley, and hope to love life and travel the world like Manny. I hope to be as romantic as Phi, and hope to have my own soul mate like Cam and Mitchel. I hope that when I am old, I can continue to start a business and learn a new language like Jay. There is always a next chapter.
Goodbye my american relatives"
190,"It was hard to see this one come to an end...it had a great run and some wonderful memories. SPOILERS AHEAD.....
I hate to say I'm disappointed in the wrap up. We saw so many adventures with this Modern Family, and to have them part their separate ways was truly lackluster for me. I get the whole new chapters, spreading their wings, etc, but for a family that prided itself on closeness and shared experiences, this sort of counters what we saw in 11 seasons. Leaving the light on was the shining moment in the end, so to speak, and that in the end did the show justice."
191,"For those of us who loved this show and are sad to see it go why would they have 3 different breaks of 2 - 4 weeks over this last season in 2020 (unless they're trying to ease us into this demise slowly)? One month between eps 14 & 15, preceded by 3 weeks bet eps 12 & 13 and followed now by 2 weeks after tonight's episode on 3-18 before we see final shows on April 1."
192,"Great show, impressed by the documentary style element as it was the first show id seen made like that. its quirky its funny, the cast are loveable. Only complaint is the last three to four seasons were nothing compared to the others, all the characters become out of touch, the show has lost surprise element and originality"
193,"The 4 Family Couples are THE DUNPHYS (Phil, Claire, Alex & Luke,)
THE TUCKER-PRITCHETTS (Cameron, Mitchell, Lillian Elizabeth ""Lily"" Dang & No Calhoun ""Cal"" Johnson,) THE DELGADO-PRITCHETTS (Jay, Gloria, Manny & Joe(y)) & THE MARSHALLS (Haley, Dylan and Paula 'Polly' & George.)
They all have A lot of Shenanigans and Mayhem and THE WHOLE FAMILY Clan went through chaos and cool, calm down and unrevealed surprises.Among The Way Haley and/or/nor Dylan didn't see the surprise parties for them due to official schedule time restraints and there's no vows and yelling SURPRISE to Haley and/or/nor Dylan Marshall to celebrate her own birthdays nor 1st Wedding Anniversary Unsightly Unseen & Unheard of."
194,I really liked this show for the first couple of seasons...but I've really got to wonder why soooo many of the network shows have to circle around gay characters now...
195,"There is nothing wrong with this show ever always. It is perfection incarnate.My toes literally curl when I watch this show. I've been known to shout instead of laughing because laughing isn't forceful enough. Also, anyone that doesn't like this show has an empty brain.The first time I watched it my laugh muscles were sore for a week, but I didn't stop. I eventually pull a smile muscle and had to go to the chiropractor. Then my stomach muscles contracted so hard from laughing that I had a hernia. Then, I did a cartwheel and transitioned into a bowl of popcorn. That sprained my ankle which I repaired with some of the humor from Modern Family.LOVE MODERN FAMILY!!"
196,"In the vapid, nearly transparent mess that television sitcoms have become, one show that has stood above the rest as the freshest and most endearing comedy in quite some time is ABC's ""Modern Family."" In the 30-minute uproar of laughs sitcom, we follow three non-traditional families through their everyday antics and how they deal with them by just beingthemselves. The series stars a wonderful ensemble of authentic, genuine characters: ""Married with Children"" star Ed O'Neill is Jay Pritchett, the patriarch of the family who is married to Gloria, (played beautifully by the even more beautiful Sofia Vergara) who is very much younger than Jay and just as high-tempered. Gloria has a son, 11-year old Manny (Rico Rodriguez), from a previous marriage. But don't let the number 11 fool you, Manny is wise beyond his years and effectively just as funny as the next adult. Jay has two children from his ex-wife (played occasionally by the delightful Shelly Long), Claire and Mitchell. Claire (Julie Bowen) is married to Phil (Ty Burrell), a zany real estate agent who sees himself as a ""cool dad."" More than not, the ""cool dad"" persona gives not only Phil some issues but drives Claire up a wall. They have three children; Haley (Sarah Hyland), a 16 year old stereotypical teenager who dates her on-again-off-again boyfriend Dylan, who's pretty looks don't often match her brains. Alex (Ariel Winter), a 14 year old wise cracking over achiever who loves tormenting her siblings in between her cello and lacrosse practices. And the youngest is the adorable Luke (Nolan Gould), the often times simple minded 11 year old who highly admires his dad and seems to be more distracted then he's aware. Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) has been involved with his partner of five years Cameron (Eric Stonestreet), a more than over the top personality that acts as the matriarch to their2 year old adopted daughter from Vietnam Lily. Mitchell is an attorney that usually makes him super organized and very paranoid to Cameron's antics whether it's his moonlighting as the clown ""Fizbo"" or wanting to dance at Lily's parent's day at school. What has made ""Modern Family"" so successful, especially in the past second season is the incredible scripting. The writing staff knows these characters inside and out, knows what they're capable of, and never takes themselves too seriously. They utilize all their talents in building some hilarious and nearly tear jerking moments all throughout the series. The series, which has gone on to earn a groundbreaking seventeen Emmy nominations including Best Comedy along with acting nominations for every adult major character in the show is staggering. In this past season we saw the family do a lot of maturing both on the adult and child side. Jay has become more sensitive to his family and seems to be growing a very tender love and admiration for his stepson Manny. Gloria has finally settled into the family and even though she still gets picked on for her mispronunciation of the English language or dressing far sexier for inappropriate events, she's officially a part of their family. Claire and Phil, as dysfunctional or annoyed as they may seem, it's evident to the viewer they have love at the center of their marriage. They continuously keep finding ways to spice up their love life which often brings them into a mess of trouble (See Episode: ""Bixby's Back"" when they bring back 'Clive' and 'Julianna'). Haley and Alex, whom in the first season seem to have been always been at each other's throats have seem to have taken a strong liking to each other and at Alex's graduation you see the true test of their sister relationship blossom as Haley reveals her insecurities about being less intelligent and compliments Alex on her addictive and wonderful personality. Lukewell, Luke is kind of the same but just getting older and even funnier. In the season finale, we see Cameron's genuine yearn to help all the kids and takes a great presence for Manny in his girl problems. Mitchell seems to share the same feelings without ever revealing it to Cameron. In the final moments of the show, Mitchell reveals to Cameron that he wants another baby and Cameron agrees but wants a boy. The performances of each of players are one of a kind, authentic and I dare you to find better on any comedy show on television today. The standouts always seem to be Eric Stonestreet, who won the Emmy for the first season, and Ty Burrell. Though hardly ever interacting with each other on screen, they seem to steal every scene they're in. Jesse Tyler Ferguson is endearing throughout the season. Sofia Vergara is electrifying, sexy, and uproariously funny. Ed O'Neill recaptures his magic we loved about him back in the 90's. Julie Bowen is magnificent and elevates the typical mother role into an accessible and triumphant comedic turn. The entire ensemble breathes new life into my television and shows the elevation of our comedy sitcom. It can still reign supreme."
197,"This might be a decent show if it wasn't so behind the times. It's supposed to be modern but it's actually far from it. Even an old show like ""The Simpsons"" has had a main vegetarian character for a long time. So this show should at least have a vegan character, but instead it's actually the opposite where they are randomly bashing vegans for stupid cheap jokes. A recent episode they were saying how they were making better money than the nearby ""vegan hotcake"" stand which was deserted. Ridiculous and pathetic. Veganism is very popular and gaining momentum everyday. Apparently the makers of this show don't care about the planet. Get with the times!"
198,I loved every season of this show (except for season 11)
199,"I was on an airplane when I first watched Modern Family. Unfortunately my sound didn't work, but I saw how beautiful Sofia Vergara was and is and I'm glad because of that superficial reason I looked up the show at home. Luckily Modern Family is on Netflix and after one episode I couldn't stop watching. Good comedy shows are rare in modern times, but this is definitely one of them.Modern Family is mostly funny, but also doesn't shy away from more serious topics like gay rights, adoption and immigrants in the US. Although I'm not from the United States the family situation is also very relatable to 'foreigners' like myself. The actor that surprised me the most was Ty Burrell, better known as Phil Dunphy, by far the person that makes me laugh the most. With Cameron in second place.Another thing I really like about Modern Family is that don't seem to care about political correctness. From the outside some people in the US seem so easily offended by jokes and I'm so happy that the writers of Modern Family don't care about that."
200,One of best TV series all time. Interesting view of 3 families. For now my favorite TV series. Hope still stay on screen more than 10. season. 10/10
201,Every week this show amazes me with its ability to have multiple hilarious story lines going on at once. I am in love with all of the characters. Even the ones that aren't that likeable. I highly recommend this show to anyone with a good sense of humor.
202,"LOVE this show. Great ensemble but the actor who plays Manny is a terrible actor. Last season it looked like a coach was trying to teach him how to use his hands more because all of a sudden he was moving his hands all over the place. He's the only one on the show not believable. I don't know if they should take him off completely or just decrease his character on the show. He's that bad. It's like a bad SNL skit where he just comes in, awkwardly says a few ridiculous lines (which were cute when he was younger), and then walks off as you're left wondering what the hell...... The actress who plays Lilly isn't so great either but she's young so I'm cutting her some slack.The rest of the actors on the show are fantastic and work so incredibly well together. The writing is terrific and hysterically funny.If they get rid of Manny I would give it a 10."
203,"Now already airing since 2009 and after many episodes I am still a fan of Modern Family. What it continues to do is amaze me in the amount of sarcasm and cynical lines said when they are in their 'talking to the viewers mode'. Characters such as Phil Dunphy are for me what makes Modern Family something I can relate to!The dynamics between Mitch and Cameron is another thing I really like. The feminine side from Cam in relation to the common sense of Mitch is priceless and quotes ""really paisley and pink"" make me laugh every time. In fact the only thing I do not find a good addition to the show, so far, is baby Joe. Looking forward to another episode! and just scrolling back through old ones"
204,"Let me start off by saying, this show is my favorite show. It is funny, crazy and everything I like in a TV show. I wish more TV shows could be like this one. Cam and Phil are my favorite characters in the show and every time they speak on the show I always end up laughing. I do believe that season three was not the best season because it was not as funny as season one and two. I did enjoy the 1st and last episode of season three because they were the funniest ones in the season. I would like to see Dylan in the show more often because he is just hilarious. In season three the dialogue was dry and left me thinking, 'seriously!?!? thats not as funny as it could be!' I was actually pretty disappointed with the turn out of season three."
205,"It is by far the best comedy show i have seen. Everything is delivered to perfection or near perfection. A very well written, acted and directed show. It may not make you laugh your guts out all the time in an episode but its laughs are natural. I mean it does not force laughs on you like most of the sitcoms or other mokumentaries. The humor is subtle and natural. Ty Burrell does a great job of being a dumb dad and he is my favorite character on the show. He makes you wonder what if he really is dumb. He is that good on the show. Jesse Tyler Ferguson and ed o Neill also acted to perfection. The show doesn't look pretentious and doesn't try to be too clever at all. It makes you feel that they are not some characters on TV but a family living in a neighborhood.A must see show for people looking for some laughter well delivered."
206,"I absolutely LOVE this programme! I think it is WONDERFUL!!! It is hilarious, and I genuinely feel happy as soon as I switch it on really. As soon as it starts I am smiling, and even though it doesn't seem like a laugh out loud comedy, I still laugh out loud at pretty much every episode. The only reason it doesn't get a ten is because sometimes the Dunphys pee me off just a bit too much (but I wouldn't get rid of them), if Claire chilled out a bit and her daughters weren't quite so extreme and slightly more believable this programme would be pitch perfect. As it is it is DAMNED CLOSE and I think that everyone should watch it."
207,"I was great in the first
Later on it become a show for gays
I stopped after session 5
I cant watch more
Stop showing us that gay thing is normal in tv like this"
208,"This is by far, the best family comedy I've watched. I can't believe I actually missed this series for 3 years, thank god for the internet!Each episode comes with a story and theme of it's own, it's like unwrapping a present with each new episode. What makes this show a hit is how close it is to the heart, the families are simply a joy to watch!The actors are simply a natural, kudos to every single one of them for making a supposedly simple comedy into one of the most hilarious and entertaining show I've watched in years. They injected life and realism into their characters.If you've missed this show, you're gonna regret it for LIFE."
209,"Modern Family is one of the best shows currently on TV. The producers and writers of the show came out swinging from the very first episode, and rarely, if ever, has there been an episode that has fallen flat. The show both admires and pokes fun at all types of modern families. There is very little, if any, political or social preaching, and the entire show is very politically incorrect. This is a breath of fresh air in a time when shows are either trying to force certain views on the audience, or are so raunchy and disrespectful of everything that the audience spends more time cringing than laughing. Whether you are male, female, young, old, gay, straight, liberal, conservative, married, or single, you'll enjoy this show and find something to relate to.The characters are eccentric and over the top, but not at all hard to believe. The jokes are not in-your-face slapstick (usually) and are delivered subtly and dry as a bone. It is a perfect blend.Modern Family really is modern America. No matter what your view is, this is a show that comes as close to reality as any show on TV. As such, it has a HUGE reservoir of material that all audiences can laugh at. If you haven't seen this show yet, you are missing out!"
210,"This truly is an excellent show which is satirical , humorous , and it has that toe - curling awkwardness at times which makes it all the more enjoyable. Basically it's about a few families who are strangely related and live close to each other. A traditional 3 kid family Concerned and feisty mother, dim witted father, typical teenage girl , smart preteen girl and a 10 year old boy with a suspected case of ADHDA Gay couple with an adorable Vietnamese daughter called Lily.An old guy , and a young hot Latino lady with a strange intellectually advanced but socially challenged son called Manny."
211,"Such a purely good show, there are simply no boring bits. It is the perfect balance between comedy and entertainment. its not just a long reaching attempt at constant laughs all its jokes are well timed, correctly placed and always do actually get a laugh. It would be hard to watch this and not enjoy it. there character development is perfect. and the show plays on their quirks nicely. they are crazy weirdos made for TV and tuned for laughs, they are very relatable and normal.do not watch it with arrested development in mind this could taint your view on the show, i believe it is better however i have heard many who have watched it expecting similarities then being disappointed."
212,"My friend kept telling me to watch this show, but it didn't sound very interesting. Then one day I saw it come up on T.V and I started watching it. Laughed so hard, it is extremely funny!! Great story line, new creative episodes each time. The character layout is very well put together. Love how there are the different sets of family life's going on throughout, but how they all are in one big Modern Family. Watching movies used to be what I would always want to do but after seeing this I can't stop watching it!!! Do yourself a favor and just watch this show to see if you like it, and I can almost promise that you will not be disappointed."
213,"It may be well underway in the states but I still have until Thursday to wait for my fix of Modern Family. Season 1 DVD purchased, watched and re-watched! Very few comedies have that impact with me: most of them I will 'catch' if they happen to be on at the time I decide to watch TV but Modern Family? - it is THAT good! Well scripted, well acted and genuinely funny. They may be extreme personalities but there is heart and sole in each of them! Phil is my personal favourite as I am ashamed to say it--I am he! There were SO many situations from season 1 that I just looked at my missus and we both laughed: its scary.Anyway, in short - you must watch this under-rated (in the UK) comedy! :-)"
214,"The show has started off in the right note... it is a family comedy of screw-ups, but it has a tone all it's own. The ensemble cast is hilarious, the highlights being Ed O' Neil, Ty Burell, and Sofia Vergara. All of the 6 main characters are really likable, and the separate format that the show uses on every episode to distinctively tell each of their stories makes it better. I was really surprised to see a show this funny come from the vein of ABC, and hopefully it lasts many years because a show this funny has not come out in quite a while. This show's title is correct... a modern representation of a modern family, simply because regular families these days are not in the normal aspect as many would think they should be."
215,"Modern Family is just one of the best sitcoms by far. It's funny, relatable and often has good a message for the viewer(like what's better than phil's-osophys). I only rated it 9 stars because the newer seasons and episodes aren't as good as the old ones but they're still good."
216,"I really don´t get all bad reviews here. Just because you don´t have a sense of humor, there is no need to downwright a whole tv-show.This show is so far, the BEST SITCOM in the 20-th century. If it would have been so awful as many of you says. How come it is still running..9 seasons and counting.The actors doing a terrific job, the script is amazing and the whole show is so IRL-realistic, sure sometimes is it not, but no serie or movie are 100% realistic.
I laugh in every scene. They don´t even need to say anything, their face espressions makes you laugh as well. 
The fact that is not filmed ""In front of a live studio audience"" makes it even better. You don´t need to here the ""fake"" laughters after every word spoken.I hope they do 10 seasons more.. But unfortunately the actors being older and might wanna do other things. Interesting to follow all of them from season 1 to 9 and see them grow up."
217,"The wife and I have watched every single episode of Modern Family since it first went on the air and tonight's episode (Feb 25, 2014 Season 06, Episode 16) was a first. The new concept for a television series had the entire episode being seen through a computer whilst Claire was forced to skype. Claire was in an airport terminal waiting for her flight back home when she accidentally dropped her cell phone in the toilet which limited her communication avenues. As a result of her little accident the entire episode required Claire to stay in touch with her family while she was in the airport via a computer whereby she skyped with various members of her family either individually and sometimes concurrently while talking and skyping with three or more family members at once.Gradually the storyline evolves with the family coming to an (incorrect) conclusion that Haley must be pregnant and so she has run off with Andy to get married in Las Vegas without telling anyone. The entire family communicates with Claire through Skype and Claire's little secrets come out that are just hilarious. These secrets divulged by Jay remind Claire of her own self as a young and very pregnant women in which she was also reminded by Jay of the time she eloped with Phil.We did watch this episode on our 60 inch TV, but maybe we should have just connected on our laptops so that we the audience could also feel that we were skyping along with Claire and the entire Pritchet clan. Kudos to the producers and the director for integrating technology with television that reflected the current times which allow high-speed internet, voice and visual technologies via Skype to set a new tone for television comedy in such a creative, unique and entertaining way. This episode should win an Emmy for its creativity and maybe we won't have to wait until the entire audience can vote on line (some day) for Modern Family to win their next round of Emmy's as this series so justly deserves once again.Modern Family continues to rate a 10 out of 10."
218,"I am a huge fan of this show, even if the quality has dipped slightly in the past couple of seasons. I think it's a lot better than some of the comedies brought out in the past 5-10 years. The only problem I have is with the kid who plays Luke Dunphy, Nolan Gould. He simply cannot act. God knows how he got the job.He sounds like a robot when he talks or someone who's struggling to remember their lines, which is weird because supposedly he's very intelligent. Bottom line is that the producers should have removed him after the first few episodes. Thankfully this error is overshadowed thanks to the amazing acting from the rest of the cast and solid story-lines."
219,"I just finished Season 5 of Modern Family a few days back and it was amazing (the season finale was awesome too but i'm not gonna spoil it here).Modern Family features families with their comedic problems and achievements that others can relate to is a great storyline. The comedy is grade A which makes me crack up a bunch of times, sometimes i even cry laughing! The little mix of drama is a clever detail to set the tone on one of the greatest sitcoms of the 21st century.The show is clever, funny and remarkably written IMO. So I give it a 10/10."
220,"We all get that feeling when we are down by something happening.One Wednesday, my sister and I, who both love watching Legal shows, Politicians and mysteries, and hardly comedies, turned on the t.v. and switched channels. Now, at this time, I do enjoy ""Parks and Recreations"", ""Arrested Development"", ""The Office"", ""30 Rock"" and other comedic shows, but I was hardly chasing after sitcoms and long form of comedies. When we came to ABC, 5:30 on the clock, Modern Family was on. My sister stopped and we watched. I laughed and enjoyed the jokes. I then repeated every Thursday for me. I was not sad anymore but thrilled. Wednesdays were marked on my calendar and I checked the shows schedule online.I never missed a live episode since the premiere.Modern Family is a GREAT comedy. No word can describe how amazing and funny and well-written it is. Its jokes are stupendous and hilarious. It is heaven on Earth. I do not know when a show will premiere that will actually eliminate Modern Family off my radar. Modern Family cures me of my stress and makes my day worth living. So as the saying goes: a day without laughter is a day wasted. I bought every disk, downloaded all episodes from iTunes and watch the new ones live!THE BEST SHOW EVER."
221,"Essentially, Modern Family is a sort of 'Mockumentary', that follows the lives of a family. We meet Jay Pritchett who has taken on the force of nature that is Gloria and her son, from her first marriage. The show also follows Claire, (Jay's daughter) and her family; her goofy husband Phil and their three children, as well as Mitchell (Jay's Son) who with his partner Cam, have adopted a baby girl.Honestly, this is one of the most funniest shows ever made in my opinion. It has some of the most lovable characters I have seen in a very long time, who are all precious in their own way. Gloria with her attitude, Phil with his one-liners, Cam with his flamboyance. The story lines are very simple, every week a new problem arises and they solve it as a family..No major story arch's. My favourite episode is perhaps 'Caught in the act', when the kids walk in on Phil and Claire having sex, it's just so awkward that it is gold!Amazing, Brilliant and Genuine!"
222,That is a modern family. That's for sure. The people perfectly match each other in this fantastic TV series. The best show since Friends I think. What is a perfect family? I don't think any family is perfect but this series show us how to life and have a good time with people around us we actually love.The producer on this show have found the ideal actors. The old Al Bundy is great and make the family whole. An rich father/grandfather and husband with a almost perfect life with a young latino wife with a little child. So now he have to start from the beginning after his own children is flown from the nest. His son is gay and adopted a girl from Vietnam together with his boyfriend. Al Bondys daughter is married with a funny guy and together they have three children. They have a great and beautiful house near they family but still a lot of troubles which makes the story and the show fun to follow. Nothing is perfect in the family but anyway everything is perfect. Watch and have a fun time.
223,"This really is one of the best comedies to come out of the States for years. The multi-faceted family are characterised in a realistic, believable and best of all very funny manner.From the dysfunctional Clare, Phil and kids, through Grandpa, his new wife and son to Mitchell and Cameron with their newly adopted baby, every scene is well acted and nuanced. The acting is all first rate and congratulations to whoever cast the show, as they are all perfect for their role.I sincerely hope a second and third series follow.Ed O'Neill is excellent as the grumpy head of the family and he has created another much more likable character than his role in Married with Children. He really is funny, sincere and touchingly warm through to grouchy and bad tempered. He is hilariously homophobic around Mitchell and Cameron, creating some of the best laughs of the show.All in all a great series and my family was hooked from the pilot episode.Watch it!!"
224,My husband and I tuned in for the pilot and have been hooked ever since... we both love this show! The characters and their quirkiness grow on you and we laugh out loud every single episode. The kids are awesome too. Ed O'Neill as the father/grandfather is spot on. The last episode where he has the grandchildren sleep over had me laughing so hard I had tears in my eyes. It seems as though ABC is pulling out all the stops as they had Elizabeth Banks and Ed Norton both guest star in the last show. This is one that I can't wait for each week and I actually re-watch it to catch things I missed the first time. Please keep this show on the air!
225,"How do I say this? I quit watching television way back in the mid 90s, except for PBS, or something that really interested me, like the Chronicles of Young Indiana Jones, or Heat of the Sun, or something that didn't have lawyers, doctors/nurses, and cops, or had some tawdry exposition of people bearing their personal lives regarding things that were once meant to be kept private.So, in a day and age of highly sexualized television to compete with online smut, what could one do? Watch sports? Subscribe to cable and tune into A&E? Heck, the pay cable stations were offering shows that were a little more creative, but also just as base.Well, I finally decided to take a chance on broadcast TV after a many year hiatus a few weeks back, and, lo and behold, I was pleasantly surprised. I actually found myself smirking, smiling, and yes, even laughing at the actual story material and actors enacting the play before me on my 10 year old SONY TV. I mean ... it was family humor. It was clever writing that harkened back to an old fashioned sense of humor.True, the shaky CAM thing has been with us since, oh, when now, the mid 80s? That is, the intentional use of giving shots a hand held look and feel is ... oh man, what's the word or phrase I'm looking for... cliché? Yeah, cliché, so much that it's now pathetic as anything. Before, shake-cam stuff was there because the cameraman had to hold the actual camera as he ran around in the jungle or on the streets of Hanoi to get some tough shots with his 16mm Bolex. Then the style got reintroduced for commercials to give products and companies an intimate feel and warm presentation. It was an unrefined look. And the majors are still using it 30 years later? One can only sigh.Phew, I got that out of my system. Okay, so the show is stylistically self referencing in that frame (no pun intended). But otherwise it's got a very fresh take on the family/neighborhood sit-com. It feels like someone finally managed to take the commercial ad veritae format and slap it into a family show. Even though it was probably formulated that way through some studio's market research, give them a hand anyway because it works.The circumstances are outlandish, and the acting is comedic, as are the stories. But this all makes for a very enjoyable program. One I will not miss in the future.Enjoy.*EDIT* Oh wow, 9 or 11 people didn't think my review helped. Gosh. I'm hurt."
226,The show is indeed very good but gets more bland and repetitive as it progresses. All in all its a good show to watch and have a good laugh.
227,"The plot is interesting, warm and touching +.a group of loving actors."
228,"It's the adventures of an extended family. Jay Pritchett (Ed O'Neill) is the patriarch with younger new wife Gloria Delgado (Sofía Vergara) and stepson Manny (Rico Rodriguez). His gay son Mitchell Pritchett (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and Mitchell's partner Cameron Tucker (Eric Stonestreet) are adopting a baby girl. Jay's daughter Claire (Julie Bowen) is married to Phil Dunphy (Ty Burrell) with three children; Haley (Sarah Hyland), Alex (Ariel Winter), and Luke (Nolan Gould).Ed O'Neill is TV royalty. Having Sofia Vergara as his wife is simple comedic genius. She is a Latina more cartoonish Peggy. Bowen and Burrell are the perfect comedic married couple. The kids are great. At the beginning, Ferguson and Stonestreet brings the show to a next level of relevance. The genius there is that the guys are lovable and regular folk. They normalize a gay married couple and them adopting a baby. These are likeable people in a likeable family. Their simple loveliness is their best aspect. It lasted eleven seasons with a diminishing return over the years. It's good."
229,"I feel so emotional, cause after 11 season its finished.
Modern Family, is like being with your family again. Lovely, funny, silly, dramatic, snob, mature, childish, multicultural bla bla bla. Every kind of person acting and they are acting well.Thanks for 11 years."
230,"It's crazy because I watched this around 2013 and I seen 3 seasons then I never saw it again. Then 2019 I decided I need to see them. I binged 1-10 and I'm glad I did but it was sad that 11 would be it's last. I've watched season 11 every week it's been on. Just finished watching the finale. I really wish I carried on watching back then, but listen it's a brilliant show. I loved it insanely. The finale had me quite upset but in a good way, knowing that everything that was happening... was for a good reason. Would recommended. Fun show, recommend binging it also. Have fun."
231,"Have watched this series from the beginning and I'm truly going to miss it. It has given me so many laughs and smiles over the years. I've never been much for sitcoms but if this doesn't rank up there with the best sitcoms ever on tv, I don't know what would. All the relationships on the show were perfect. I can honestly say I'll miss every single character on the show. Well done guys. And I loved the series finale."
232,"I can re-watch this series a million times and still not get bored. The actors really suit their characters well. One thing that have noticed about this series is that they relate to things that happen in our everyday life which us (the viewers) ca relate to, and to that they add a lot of comedy. The small story lines that they have pull the curiosity of the viewers. There is nothing i would change about the series. The series shows a lot of different types of people which makes society more accepting."
233,"I sure do give this series an 9 out of then. It's a comedy, which I love. It represents the problems modern families have these days. It's showed in a funny way. A episode is only 20 minutes long, so you can just 'watch one more episode'. You know that will turn out in watching three more. But that is because it's catchy.I watched all the seasons, you can see them grow up. You don't have to follow the whole season, because their all episodes apart. Which I prefer. I do recommend to watch them all, because sometimes they talk about things that happened before.The first family is the Dunphy family, Claire and Phil are married and have three kids. Haley is the oldest one and the wild one. Alex is the middle one and the nerd one. Luuk is the youngest one.The second family is the Pritchett family. Jay and Gloria are married, Jay is rich and old, Gloria comes from a poor city and is 20 years younger than her husband. Manny is Gloria's son. He acts much older than he really is.As you can see there are three different families, but all very common to daily life. If you like a series which has many episodes and a lot of humor in it, I really recommend Modern Family."
234,"Modern Family is one of the best comedy TV shows. The story line isn't complicated: It's about the members of a family in Los Angeles. Every episode has an individual story. All the characters are very recognizable and that's the strength of this TV show. The stories are not far-fetched or unrealistic, yet every episode is original and far from boring. Modern Family started in 2009 so there are 8 seasons and 2 are yet to come. Because of this, you see the characters evolving over the years. For example, Haley started as a puberty 15 year old and in the last seasons she is an adult. Some of the actors started at a very young age (Luke and Manny), but in the course of the seasons they became ever better actors. Modern Family is a feel-good show which you can watch at any moment. It's not that after one episode you must watch the next to know how the story will continue. This is relaxing, but sometimes it is also a downside: some episodes are much like each other. That's why I rate Modern Family a 9 instead of a 10."
235,"I don't watch too much TV generally, and I have few favourites in comedy, especially. I believe comedy's appeal lies in its being relatable as well as natural. And that's quite a challenge, and almost everyone fails at it.Not this series. This is by far the funniest series I've ever watched.Phil Dunphy is undoubtedly the star of the show, a real show-stealer, with his amazing timing and those facial expressions. Most of all, what's really satisfying to see is a kind man depicted as a winner, which happens rarely. Most people shown in 'comedies' are generally nasty and unlikeable and plain jerks. Not this one, he has a heart of gold, and seems to be the most humanly humans in the series. The character has been developed to such perfection that it cannot be outdone. And Mr. Burrell has acted, rather, lived the role of his life.He is complemented spectacularly by Ms. Bowen. These two are the real geniuses behind the show's appeal and popularity, I feel.If I had a qualm about one thing, it's the meanness behind a few dialogues. I think it stems from the creators' meanness. There are too many casual descriptions of animal cruelty in the series. For a 'Modern Family', Jay and Gloria and Mitch and Cam talk like savages. I detest the implicit endorsement of animal cruelty, and wish the writers didn't have to go to such disgusting lows in the name of comedy.But overall, this is a series I'd binge watch every time. There's no way I'm getting tired of this one."
236,"Like Friends, this show is another favourite of mine. It is well- written, there are different situations the families face. The show overcomes themes such as family bonding, love, gender, etc. It shows a lot of realistic situations and that is nice to see. It is well-acted, all the actors have done an amazing job especially Sofia Vergara as Gloria. All characters are interconnected with each other, no character is just left out. Manny was a very cute, chirpy and happy child but now they have just ruined his character, he is too stubborn, dull and not interesting, this is why I gave the show 9/10."
237,"For a long time before I decided to start watching 'Modern Family' I've been having doubts about quality and originality of the show. Now I'm in season 7 and I can not get enough of it. The story is easy to follow so you can just sit back and enjoy. When I'm having a break doing work I just put on an episode and it takes my mind off. The thing I was most surprised about after seeing it was the variety of characters. There's a conventional family with three kids. The wife Claire Dunphy is a control and organization freak but she has hers funny outbursts. Husband Phil comes off a bit childlike, always trying to be 'the cool dad', but he also brings the family together and shares valuable life lessons. The oldest daughter Haley is a popular, party girl and her younger sister Alex is very competitive, nerdy girl. Their youngest child Luke is a lot like his dad and they always do funny, odd stuff together. Claire's father Jay Pritchett makes another family in the show. He remarried a Colombian wife Gloria and took her and her son Manny in. She is very beautiful and also younger than his daughter so people always assume she married him out of interest, but we are soon proved wrong. Jay's second child, Claire's brother Mitchell, is gay and in a long relationship with his partner Cameron with whom he adopted a Vietnamese baby girl Lily. When the whole family gets together, there's no way escaping drama and that's the case in almost every episode. It's a great comedy source but it can get a little too familiar from time to time, so that's why I rated it 8 out of 10.With everything in count, it's still one of the best shows in its genre and I would definitely recommend it."
238,"Like holding up a mirror to our lives. These characters are brilliantly funny. Great scripts and great characters, all excellently portrayed. Thank you to all concerned."
239,"""IT'S GOOD!!!"". This sentence tell it all. It became one of my favorite TV series just by watching the 1st season. All characters are lovable but I think Ty Burrell and Rico Rodriguez characters are really steal the show.The series story is things happen around three family in which is related to each other. Simple, isn't it?.Parts of the difference from this show than others is sometimes the character would stare to the camera as if it's record by amateur camera, Talk and tell the camera as if it's a reality show, And I don't hear any ""Laughing sound"" like any others. That's why it's the modern kind of sitcom.It lighted my day by watching it. ""MUST WATCH"""
240,"I have to admit that this show has grown on me, I watch it regularly and the humor seems to have improved later on. I also watch it out of nostalgic Bundy sentiments... However, I still don't see why it is supposed to be the best show in the comedy lineup. And here are the reasons why:They just went berserk with stereotypes. I mean come on, here are the ""gays"", there the ""dorks"", there the high school sweetheart. This is overused to the extreme! Is it so difficult to produce an American series without clichés?Name just one character that has not gone on your nerves at some point! I can't. They are not unlovable, but why do they always have to behave in the same, shrill way?The main issue bothering me: It is not believable for any of the pairs that at one point they have met and liked each other for long enough to still be together. I just can't see this realistically - or even unrealistically in a sitcom world. Also, how come at least half of the characters are not dead yet? Judging by the idiocy going on every week, which is funny in the situation - but all in all, who could always dodge bullets for a longer period? On one hand this is cartoon slapstick humor, on the other hand the show has set itself the semi-realistic challenge to portrait a modern family suited to current society. Somehow it does neither to a full extent."
241,"I LOVE this show. I can in a few ways totally relate to this show...I basically had given up on watching most TV shows other than things like Family Guy and Mythbusters. And now along with Cougar Town I'm glued to the TV every Wednesday night.Ed O'Neil is one of my all time favourites and for him to be back on TV is like a dream come true. Married With Children was pretty much the last long running sitcom I followed every week, and now own all 11 seasons on DVD. This show will most defiantly be making my DVD collection when it gets released.So to ABC thank you so very much for making TV and life funny again, and keep up the amazing work."
242,Modern Family is Okay but It gets boring sometimehe last season came I hated it. there were no funny peole in the end there was nobody to laugh at. I have looked at it on TV BUT turn it off later I enjoy Frieds more. My Friend Nathaniel is sitting right next to me and enjoying it. I see some funny bits but it is bad
243,"Modern family is about a large family, Jay Pritchett (Ed o'Neal) being the head who is married to his second wife Gloria Delgado-Pritchett (Sofia Vergara), and step dad to Manny Delgado (Rico Rodriguez). Then there is Claire Dunphey (Julie Bowen) who is married to Phil Dunphey (Ty Burrel), whom have three kids, Haley (Sarah Hyland), Alex (Ariel Winter), and Luke Dunphey (Nolan Gould). Finally there is the homosexual couple Cameron Tucker and Mitchell Pritchett and their adopted daughter Lilly Tucker-Pritchett (Aubrey Anderson-Emmons).This is he best sit-com on telly, it is about a large family who face day to day dilemmas and embarrassing experiences. Each episode focuses on one or more characters day, e.g Phil buying a new car, or Lilly loosing her favourite toy, each with a twist of humour. The series are extremely well written and depict a family's life very well. This even could beat Frasier in some aspects as the humour is out of this world, anyone who doesn't like it should get a sense of humour. This is truly the best sit-com out there! If you haven't seen it yet I would watch it! **********/10 (Brilliant)"
244,"From the moment Modern Family came on Sky 1 unheralded I have been hooked and so have my family. I watch a large percentage of the network comedies on US TV - Big Bang Theory, Parks and Rec, HIMYM, Community to name just a few, but Modern Family is in a league of its own. There is not a single episode which I can remember not enjoying, in spite of what some reviewers have said. I own the first 3 seasons and have watched every episode multiple times. Anyone who has not watched it doesn't know what they're missing.The show's premise is a fairly simple one common to many American sitcoms, but what makes the show special is that the characters are so relatable and likable. Four seasons in and they feel like members of your own family.The story lines follow 3 interconnected strands of a single family: The Dunphys are the most traditional - Phil and Claire, and their three children, typical teenager Haley, book smart tween Alex and the youngest, Luke. Claire's brother Mitchell is gay, and lives with his partner Cam, and they (spoiler) adopt a baby Lily from Vietnam in the first episode. Claire and Mitchell's father Jay is remarried to a hot younger wife, the Columbian Gloria, who has son Manny from her previous marriage. Every episode follows the three sections of the family, and they often meet for social events and gatherings at one of the houses.The show works because, 1) it is laugh out loud funny, and 2) it has a great big heart. The characters have disagreements but underpinning it all is a sense of warmth and affection for each other. The show should be on people's must-watch list, and it should run for years."
245,"One Of The Best Comedies Of All Time!""Modern Family"" is one of the most praised and most watched comedy t.v. shows that is actually entertaining. There are several reasons as to why. For starters, the story lines include real life situations that you can relate to. The shows are pretty dependable when it comes to well thought out plots and story lines. In addition, the writers for this comedy t.v. show are canny and have a great sense of humor. Furthermore, ""Modern Family"" is an abundant show that families enjoy watching. Reason being is that the story lines are facile to relate to. For example, the Dunphy family is always dealing with a new issue. Whether it be with their teenage daughter, Hayley, who graduated and is off two college or their not so bright son, Luke, who happens to take after his father, Phil, or their genius middle child daughter, Alex, who just is not super social. Multiple issues they deal with are dealt with in families just like yours and mine. To demonstrate, Phil Dunphy who is all about trying to be cool and be more like friends with his kids rather than a dad ends up embarrassing them. I think that a lot of kids may deal with a situation like this or similar to. Essentially, the main reason this show has become so popular is because of how the writers intermix humor and seriousness so well into it. People get bored when t.v shows are just constantly funny or serious. The writers make sure with every script they write that each one consists of just the right amount of sobriety and comicalness. This way, the audience does not get bored while watching this show. You are typically continuously entertained when watching this t.v. show.On the other hand, some people feel that the story lines are not relatable. Some people feel that the trials the families face are too exaggerated. I can see why people lean to that because not everything on the show is realistic. However, people have to keep in mind that it is only a t.v. show. Plus, it is a comedy and as long as you are being entertained it should not matter how realistic the story lines may or may not be.Moreover, ""Modern Family"" has wise and farcical show writers. The creators of this hit t.v. show are Steven Levitan and Christopher Lloyd. An example of how this show is humorous is a quote from Phil Dunphy. ""When life gives you lemonade, make lemons. Life will be all whaaat?"" This quote was from his philsosophy book which he created for his oldest daughter Hayley when she went off to college. This quote also symbolizes how the humor is not real serious humor; it is just fun and silly and sometimes stupid. The actors is this show precisely make the show what it is. Some of the humor may not be expressed as funny if it was not for the actors and how they contemporaneous it in front of the camera. Overall, ""Modern Family"" is a well-casted and directed t.v. show. I would recommend this comedy series to people who enjoy a good laugh and who understand the challenges families face and what they do to overcome them. This comedy includes satisfactory story lines that you can relate to. Also, the writers include humor as well as serious matters into the script and the writers for this show are wise and entertaining."
246,"Modern Family is probably the best show I have ever seen, it's laugh out loud funny, and I have watched repeats over and over again. The first half of season 3 kind of waned a bit, but it got back to it's best in the second half. The pilot was hilarious, with Cam holding baby Lilly in the air with the song from the Lion King playing, I almost cried laughing. Did anyone else notice Julie Bowen (Clare) in the pilot, obviously extremely pregnant, trying to hide her baby bump? She looked ten times better heavily pregnant in the pilot than she does in later episodes when she's all skin and bones. That girl needs to eat a few burgers. The show could have been completely ruined by the casting of the children, but all the kids are great, especially Manny. I have turned off other shows or movies that are just as funny if the kids annoy me. I hate when they try to act all cute and they just aren't. Thank goodness these kids are great little actors. Hopefully my first born is as quiet and obedient as Lilly was in the first two seasons. And Haley is such a typical teenage girl in todays world, always on the phone and texting her family across the table instead of actually talking to them. Without a doubt, Cam is my favourite. He steals every scene he is in. And he and Mitchell are adorable together. Although I did notice the first season they barely even touched each other, let alone kiss, which they correctly fixed in season two. There might be the odd person who refuses to watch it because of a kiss but who cares. My favourite episode is when Clare and Mitchell's mother makes an appearance to apologise about her behaviour at Jay and Gloria's wedding. The flashback scene where she knocks the cake over while imitating Gloria is the funniest thing I have ever seen.All in all, a fantastic show, I hope it carries on into many, many seasons."
247,"By the end of the first episode of this show, I was hooked. I couldn't stop watching, and watched all of the episodes in the first and second seasons right in a row. Waiting for the third season was absolute torture, and now waiting for the fourth is going to be the same thing all over again. This show is absolutely hilarious and has me rolling on the floor at least 5 times per episode. Gummy bears...my cousin typed that with her pretzel stick; sorry; let's get back to the review. Anyway, there are so many personalities reflected in this show, and while every character is so distinctively different from the others, they all fit together perfectly. The writers-and actors-in this show were perfectly chosen and are extremely talented. I have yet to come across a joke that was made and wasn't funny, and haven't yet seen an episode that I didn't like-I've watched all of them about 10 times over and I'm still going!!! I am completely obsessed with this show and suggest that you watch it too. It's definitely worth your time."
248,"Ever wonder what Al Bundy (Married with Children) might be like as a grandfather, if he started his own successful business, married a hot Latina, and spent a bunch of time with her intelligent, chubby kid with a good heart and old soul? Well, O'Neill is not exactly Bundy in this show, but he brings every bit of the ""guy's guy"" to his Jay Pritchett character. In fact, I just read that O'Neill learned (and still practices) Brazilian Ju-Jitsu from the Gracie family (often credited for elevating BJJ to a mainstream, respected martial arts style throughout the world), earned his black belt in 2007 (after 15 years of training), and was signed by the Pittsburgh Steelers as an outside linebacker in 1969 (although he was cut from the team before the start of the regular season), so he is officially a bona fide bad-ass. I especially enjoy his head-to-head exchanges with Benjamin Bratt when he guest stars as Javier Delgado, Pritchett's wife's (Vergara's) ex-husband and father of her son.This show is hilarious, clever, witty, and endearing, and the entire cast is top-notch. Rico Rodriguez often steals the show as that intelligent, chubby kid I mentioned above; he's working with great scripts, but he nails every line, gesture, and non-verbal cue; that kid's got a bright future ahead of him. Vergara and Julie Bowen skillfully balance hot and eccentric. At first, I found Burrell's character, Phil Dunphy, to be creepy and unlikable, but Burrell quickly developed him into a goofy, ADD-stricken, creative, and loving father, who is now one of my favorite characters on the show. Nolan Gould masterfully displays many of Phil's characteristics in his own way, making him very believable as Phil's son. Eric Stonestreet is funny and charismatic as Cameron Tucker, Pritchett's son's (Jesse Tyler Ferguson's) domestic partner and co-father (is that the right word?) of a little Asian girl (I'm assuming that this was a sarcastic move by the show, since it's so intelligent in all other respects); I believe that the decision to make him a former Missouri farmhand and University of Illinois football player was great in that it would have added another dimension to his character, breaking from the stereotype that all gays are effeminate, but unfortunately, whether it's due to the script or Stonestreet's acting decisions, Cam is a big queen (he even runs like an uncoordinated little girl, making his college football and farm careers unbelievable), and the benefit of that background piece is lost.All in all, though, this show is consistently great. I know that I will laugh and be entertained every time that I watch an episode. I would recommend that everyone set aside to watch this series at some time."
249,"I love the show, the somewhat ""random"" filming, the jokes and the personalities. What I don't like so much about it, is all the touchy-feely moments at the end of the show. Where everyone becomes friends again, where everyone love each other and just having great family moments. I understand that this is a show about different types of families, but I think they should turn it down a bit. They try to kind of ""cover it up"" with a joke at the end, but I think it's too much of a ""Full House""- feeling to it. But as I said, this is the only thing I can complain on. Otherwise I love the show, and this is about the only show that actually makes me laugh out loud when I'm watching it by myself. Keep it up!"
250,"Most stupid show i've ever seen. I watched these a whole season and i litteraly can't laugh with these stupid and annoying characters. Bad actors, bad writing and none humor.There are a lot of bad shows out there but these is more bad then my top 50. Why the heck are people laughing with this dumb show? I'm a Belgian and here are really bad actors and bad movies. If i didn't know better, i would think this is Dutch and Flemish quality."
251,"Now, this is a show that makes me laugh. In a minute there is two things that are hilarious. Every minute. I first saw this series (thanks to Netflix) a day ago. I thought that Ed O'Neill would be funny and that's why I watched the first episode, but this is not about Ed O'Neill. The characters in this show are so awesome, and only thing that I wish is they don't blow my head off in every minute. Twice in a minute. Just awesome. Well... I could be wrong, but this is what this troubled world needs just now. Laughs, family, more porn. Boobs. I don't like humour, because I'm serious about humour, but this show really is funny. As I said, there is a joke (not a joke) in every minute of this show. So my best show ever."
252,"I love this show. Its well done and I really look forward to it. Its refreshing. Its great for all generations and its just not a family show, you do not have to have ""kids"" to get it. You just have to have a family to appreciate how very different every family is even within your own extended family. They put the fun in dysfunctional for sure.I love how the Dunphys do their candid interview on the couch every episode. Kinda like Mr. & Mrs. Smith.Every role is well acted and all the characters are lovable in their own way.I hope this one lasts a long time too."
253,"This is just my opinion, but the show is not funny, not funny at all."
254,"I love this show and have loved watching all the kids grow up and come into their own stories. Jeremy M. A.k.a. Joe is an ABSOLUTE gem. This kid was born to act! He is exceptional on so many levels I pray his career continues forever, he really is a natural talent. Poor Aubrey a.k.a. Lilly not so much. I truly don't mean to hurt any feelings but she is so dry... It always seems forced, coached. I kept thinking it would get better as she got older but alas... I stand corrected. Painful to watch her."
255,Wow man it taughts so many things in just 20minutes with so many laughs just can't believe they are not going to make more episodes :(. Thank you!
256,"This show is easily one of the greatest tv comedies of all time. The final season was really good,it was the best season since the fifth which was the last really good one.Between the sixth and the tenth season the show lost some of its magic but the first five maybe six and the final season are so good that stand out and nothing can change the final impression of this show which is positive to the utmost.
I don't want to get into many details.The ensemble cast was really charismatic and there was great chemistry.The writing and direction were brilliant.
All in all this show is going to be missed because shows like this don't happen very often.I hope they're going to make a spin-off at some point.In case that doesn't hapen I can always watch this again from the start to relive the unique emotions I felt the first time."
257,I've loved it since the very beginning and I still love it today. It'll be a sad day when this ends.
258,"This is one of my favorite shows of all time. I love the endings, how they reflect and make me cry almost every time! I will truly be emotional for the ending.
One idea I had was to have the last episode or two reveal the reason behind the interviews. Who is filming this and why? Maybe Luke or Manny for a college dissertation? I think it could be quite powerful and emotional.
Season 10 easily could have ended and come full circle, but the cast, crew, etc. clearly want more and want it to end strong. One thing that has set this show apart was the emotional talks at the end of each episode, so this needs to pack a powerful punch. I feel like they need that full circle element and addressing the interviews could do that."
259,"Never disappointing and always a hoot. This show never disappoints. From the actors and actresses to the writers, on point and very funny."
260,"Modern Family cracks me up every time. Each character feels so real and you really get to know them more and more each episode. The credibility of the characters lies mostly in their complexity as you get to watch them constantly contradicting themselves. It is definitely a feel-good TV show, as loving and caring families are shown in each episode. Personally, I find most of the puns and jokes hilarious- but I understand that is completely subjective. Every scene with Sofia Vergara is absolutely hilarious.One of the things that I completely hated about this show were how a supposedly ""politically correct"" TV series is so reluctant to including so many sexist jokes. I did not expect this from this show, where the characters are supposedly supportive and open-minded. In several instances throughout the show, the word ""woman"" or ""girl"" is strongly associated with inferiority. Cam is offended by being considered the mother of the family. Basically if someone wants to offend someone, they just call them a ""lady"". It crosses the line so far that at one point of the show, Claire uses the word ""girl"" to insult Gloria, another female character in the show. However, the female characters are portrayed as strong and independent, which makes it completely illogical to include sexist jokes. Another downside to this show is Cam. I utterly hate his hyperbolic personality, which adds to the melodrama of the show. He could have had the exact same personality except for being overly sensitive and nagging throughout the whole show. You start disliking him so much that you actually want something bad to happen to him.I continue watching this show as the sexist jokes are tolerable and luckily, Cam is not really the main character. Nobody really is, but it seems like there is relatively low focus on him as compared to the other characters. I recommend this show to anyone who feels like having a good laugh without becoming completely addicted to the series."
261,"I have been watching this series for a while now but I'm always amazed on how they bring something new and funny in every single episode. Seriously this series will make a chimpanzee laugh(just kidding). My personal favourite episode was the Connection Lost, I mean what a change! It's a bit off, the family-friendly side but in all a great series to watch."
262,"I've only been watching this show for a few months. However, out of all of my favorite shows, it is probably the one that took me the shortest amount of time to like. After watching only a few minutes of the pilot, I knew that this was something I was going to fall in love with. The characters are fantastic. All three of the adult couples have great chemistry. For me, the character that really makes the show is Phil (the father of the ""traditional"" family). I had never heard of Ty Burrell before this show, and I have yet to watch him in anything else...but he is absolutely perfect in this role.If I were to make a list of complaints about this show, it would be very short. At the top of the list, however, would be one of the kids--Manny Delgado. He is the only character that annoys me on a regular basis. Claire (the mother of the ""traditional"" family), has also irritated me in a few episodes, but that's not very frequent. Overall, I have almost no complaints about the rest of the main characters, so I am perfectly alright with overlooking my annoyances with those two.It's had its share of episodes that I haven't particularly enjoyed, but that has been rare."
263,"I was looking at the top shows ratings here on IMDb,really wanted to watch some true comedy and the title 'Modern Family' seemed like it might do that job.I watched the trailer,downloaded the first season and man was i right! I couldn't stop watching it. Unlike all the other sitcoms,this show was different,it was so hilarious that I watched some scenes over and over again.The characters are just genius!This is one of my favorite TV shows and the jokes are not entirely dedicated to sex like How I met your mother etc.I believe it's a nice change in the recent years comedy.Laughter makes you feel good and this show proves it,believe me I a much more happy person now."
264,"I was really excited for the return of Ed O Neill. But this show is just boring,mediocre jokes. I don't know how did this last so long, and get nominated for Golden Globe? Just terrible.Married with children was an all time classic. So casting old Al Bundy into the show was just bait. I don't know what other people see in this one. I give it a 1 star out of 10. Just boring just like our modern Society"
265,I really enjoyed the first nine seasons but sadly the tenth season is quite underwhelming. Still a good one but not even close to the previous nine. It would have been a 10/10 if season 10 had delivered.
266,"ABC-TV is Ready The New 4th Family on ""The New Modern Family"" and Haley Say Yes to Dylan before & after the baby twins come to the earth and they'll Having A Wedding and later this year for the new season is an Christening at The Church by The Minister and giving an christening to the new little twins from the Modern Family and introducing Mr. & Mrs. Haley & Dylan Marshall & Family as the new newlywed couple & family No. 4 on the new ABC-TV Show for 20th Century Fox is called ""The New Marshalls"" Starring Sarah Hyland & Reid Ewing are Haley & Dylan Marshall and the twin children has been named Birdie & Duke Marshall are will be casted and the new members, possible new neighbors and brand new people for ABC-TV in the 2019-2020 season will be along with the Wednesday parent program ""The New Modern Family"" on Wednesday September 25, 2019 at still at 9:00-8:31 PM Eastern ."
267,"Note: I have not watched past season 5, and I have no intention of watching further.The viewers can relate to something about every character, and it's quite entertaining to have a laugh at the family while you're somewhat laughing at yourself. Season 5 appears to show that they are running low on material, so I stopped watching there before the series got too bad. I suggest watching through season 4 and then stopping."
268,We need talk about Jay's family and background. We just need more characters like Joey. Great comedy tv show!!!
269,"I absolutely love this show!!! This is honestly one of the greatest comedy shows I have ever seen. It's not easy to make me laugh, but watching this show I laughed out loud at numerous parts. It's definitely humorous, light-hearted, epic and unpredictable. I've probably seen every single episode, but I could still watch this over and over again. I love the characters, they all delivered an amazing performance in their roles. After numerous twists and turns, the ending is always powerful, epic and thought-provoking.I find this show different from other shows: the situations are hilarious, but underneath there's a heartwarming story. I like that all the characters are certain stereotypes of people, but they all have their own unique way. It definitely reflects the growing image of society's families nowadays. I love how they are showing three different families, but actually they're all one big family. There's a man in his sixties, with a foreign, young wife and her son. There's another family of a man, woman, and their two daughters and son. And then you have two gay man and their adopted Vietnamese daughter. Everyone is related. They're absolutely fantastic together. No doubt this show is entertaining and brings into a good mood."
270,"I have watched through all the episodes released (so far) three times now. I recently had a break-up with the love of my life, so I was looking for something to keep me busy in the days that followed. So I began watching this series a fourth time. My only concern is that I burn through the episodes with such speed that they soon will end. By then, I probably will begin watching them once again.Because this is, by far, the best modern day TV show there is. I actually don't laugh a lot at it, but somehow, it always puts a smile on my mouth. Because it is not the jokes that make this show. Actually, the reason I don't give this show a 10, is because of the, sometimes, corky jokes and at times, the poor acting. However, what makes the show worth watching is feel good. One gets to follow the joy of these three families, the heartbreak, the sadness and everything in between. The feeling of being close is what the secret of this show is. Knowing that even the most perfect of families not are perfect, knowing that families who are non-traditional can be happy, makes this show both funny and meaningful. We all recognise ourselves in the characters, struggling to get their daily lives together. The key to this is how the script is perfect for each character. That makes it feel really realistic. The timing of the comments in the show is the finishing touch.I do, however, feel that sometimes this show is a bit too feel good. I never felt this in the past, but watching it after getting my heart split in a thousand pieces, makes me a bit sad because of how perfect everything is, and one think their problems are more insignificant than ones own problems. When watching it in this moment, though, I cannot help but love how these characters help me through my days after being left by the woman I love. Especielly interesting is the action packed episodes where the families go to Australia, to Las Vegas, to Hawaii and so on. These are always something extra and packed with jokes that makes me even laugh out loud.Whether or not you have a big and happy family like the one in the show, a smaller one or none at all, we can all enjoy sharing the joy, as well as the pain and sadness, of three families."
271,"This is honestly one of the greatest comedy shows I have ever seen. As if this show couldn't get any better it deals with some interesting topics such as interracial marriage as well as same sex marriage. Although most people like to laugh at me when ever I say this I honestly believe that this show is an inspiration. Usually I'll take something from the show and compare it to how I should do something. For example there are numerous times when Claire and Mitchell who are siblings will stand up to there father. Which is one thing that keeps me watching the show. This show features multiple celebrity guest stars. Overall I give this show a 10 out of 10 due to the fact that I came in thinking this would be the biggest waste of my time ever, however modern family has skyrocketed to the top of my list of greatest shows I have ever watched. It's funny and inspirational and I'd highly recommend anyone to watch this with your family."
272,"This is a really good show - for one season. It's funny and touching. The characters are real, they have their comedic quirks, and they care about each other. After that, it's just run-of-the-mill, crank 'em out every week, sitcom crap. My 10-year old daughter continued to watch half way through Season 2, but I had to make her stop. I couldn't even stand for it to be on in the background.But don't let that keep you from watching Season 1.This happens to most TV shows. The creators have good ideas and do most of the writing for the first season. You come to relate to the characters and want to know what happens to them. But greatness is measured and the creators can't keep it up forever. So they bring in ""writers"", the guys who crank out insults in place of humor and people getting caught in lies instead of drama. (Oh, and dramatic irony, you know, where the audience knows but the characters don't; like the husband and wife who in Season 1 were so in tune that they completed each others sentences, but in Season 2 have no clue what the other one is feeling, no clue what he really means by that tone in his voice, no clue what any sentient being, like the audience, would know is really going on because now all the characters are completely emotionally retarded. Yeah, dramatic irony. Really hate that.) But watch Season 1 of Modern Family (and Cheers, Heroes, Once Upon a Time, ....)"
273,"Producers have acknowledged they stole the whole idea for this episode from a short film called Noah. So what's the shouting about? It was a cliché-filled story (she was in the basement all along, but no one thought to look thereHER ROOM!) in a shiny package they stole. And brought to you by Apple! This is the all too sad pattern of most good shows. They start believing in themselves after a point and think they can serve any old thing up and we will love them. Yes the package here was a keen one, but credit there goes to some filmmakers from Oregon who came up with it. The writing here, which used to be the meat and potatoes of this show, is very weak. Sorry to see a good show resort to gimmicks instead of hard work."
274,"Modern Family is a winner! It's so funny, the cast is perfect and it is refreshing to say the least. 3 families, all related, but so different. You can't help laughing at the craziness that comes from such ordinary situations. Jay Pritchett, played by Ed O'Neill, is so likable as the patriarch who is married to a much younger Gloria,( Sophia Vergara, whom I love)! Her son Manny ( a very talented Rico Rodriguez)is so amusing. The daughter, Claire is played by Julie Bowen ( previously on Ed) married to Phil (the hilarious Ty Burrell).They have three children. The last family member is gay son Mitchell and his partner Cameron (actors Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Eric Stonestreet) who have recently adopted a daughter Lily. The stories are ordinary stories but with such a super cast and superb writing, they seem so fresh!"
275,"I've come across many sitcoms, but Modern Family is not only the best sitocm but the best show I've ever seen. I haven't even seen all the episodes, but I've already started to binge watch watch it. I was late in discovering this show considered knew about in fall 2018. From watching then, on almost all the episodes, I've laughed out so loud! This show is different from all the other ones out there, whether it be the characters, the storylines, and just everything about it, is really really good, and I really feel a connection to this show. Watching this show always makes my day, and nothing else could've been so fun other than watching MF. I don't really know to how to express my feelings because I'm so obsessed and in love with spectacular show. I'm one of the biggest fans and its not only hilarious and also depicts family values, and the behavior of each character is unique and also represents people of different ethnicities and sexual orientation. I really don't what else to say other than that it is the most entertaining show for me. But Modern Family is the best show I've ever seen and I don't expect anything else to replace this show. Period."
276,Probably watched it 10 times. Feel like I'm part of the family!
277,THE BEST COMEDY SERIES I'VE EVER WATCHED!!! I totally love the whole cast. Well written and good laughs.
278,Why is lily the only character that's not really part of the show. It's weird
279,"some news say the modern family is very good. e.g.New family comedy of the year. Every actor in the play is very good, and every family is very interesting. And different from many shows, the continuity of the play is very strong. In one word, ""modern family"" is one of the most outstanding comedies in the quarter. Among the most significant outstanding autumn drama sitcom. Since the ""happy a pro"", no a sitcom, such as ""modern family"" like the warmth and wit perfect fusion, and easily adapted to different joke changes, from the most ordinary but word games to hilarious dialogue, reuse drama of all things in the amusing are difficult to it. """
280,"Easily my favourite show of the 2010's, modern family has been around for six season and shows no signs of stopping any time soon. This is my favourite TV comedy since 'How I met your mother' and I don't think there has been an episode in it's six season that has not made me laugh. Modern family's comedy style is a type I can not get enough of and is slightly addictive. So Far I've seen the first five seasons (each as great as the last) and every character never fails to bring the laughs. If you are looking for a great, Funny, well written, well acted and overall hysterical comedy series look no further than the brilliant 'Modern family'"
281,"This has been the next big thing for comedy since 2009! I didn't like it from the first few episodes, I thought it was different, the camera work, and the interviews were a bit annoying to me, but the characters were spot on!Later on, I grew to love the show more, and more, even the camera work which I hated, it actually made it feel like a real family to me. The writers do a great job, and the actors portrayal of each character is perfect, every character feels true, and not just ""a character"": a crazy member in a crazy loving family. I relate to 90% of what happens in the show, very realistic scenarios, and very funny. You got generations, and different characters, which you must relate to, one way or another, which is exactly what makes it the perfect show.The life lessons, or whatever they are at the end of episodes are heartwarming, they truly feel like real life advice, and I always enjoy them.I hope this show lasts as long as they can make it last, because the day when we stop loving it will never come."
282,"The show is about rich white liberals. Who would want to watch that? It is so boring. Like trying to watch paint dry. Not to mention throughout the show the liberals don't mind their own business, and push their own values onto other people."
283,"I'm a fan of comedy series, 5 years ago i tired start this Modern Family show and i didn't like it, I don't remember why but now, After 5 years i start to watch the show again and now i just find out why i didn't like the show 5 years ago, Filming is really bad, It's like documentary movies, Camera is always moving and that's make me nervous."
284,"Do I really need to make compliment on this masterpiece or everyone knows how great, lovely and funny they are? I just cannot picture a life without seeing them, please never stop producing new seasons, people need you."
285,"Modern Family has always been and will be one of the best TV series. His professionalism in acting, production has been demonstrated that for 6 years on the air. A series created with unique style, without ethnic DISCRIMINATION, appropriate universal language for future generations, culturally focused DAILY FAMILY ISSUES. Modern Family continue triumphing by their originality and creativity focused on the daily problems of the family. Human artistic quality and professionalism of his cast have made this one of the most series view. Since beginning until now the technical quality has evolved rapidly and have adapted to the rhythm going technology. Good point in his favor. Modern Family the best series TV until today."
286,"During season one, I just thought it would be another Bill-Cosby-Show. In season two, the writing and the actors grew on me, though they are most often based on stereotypes. The kids throw hilarious punchlines. But it is a show that could not live without the dry sense of humour of the leading couple between Ed O'Neill and Sophia Vergara who sometimes bring elements of the unforgetten MWC into it. Watch the series back to back, you will see some scenes in ""Modern Family"" that will remind you of ""Married...with Children"". ""Modern Family"" feels like Al Bundy hit the lottery jackpot. The stereotypes sometimes are exaggerated, but it is still easy entertainment. If you want a really black sense of humour, watch Monty Python or MWC. Kudos to Ed O'Neill for playing Al Bundy and Jay whatever...Good choice of roles! My main point of criticism is that this family is wealthy and will never hit rock bottom like the Bundys, but apart from that, it is a funny show."
287,"Very few US sitcoms can leave that country and find a home abroad. Frasier was one that springs to mind and Big Bang Theory is another. The rest... don't work that well, because of differing cultural perceptions of what constitutes ""funny.""Well, add Modern Family to that list, a show about the siblings of Jay (the terrific and badly underrated Ed O'Neil), his new wife and her son, and Jake's children and grandchildren. It is at times exquisite, warm, downright hilarious, captivating, incisive, and always interesting. The writers have done a superb job of character creation, and it says much that my friends and I each have a favorite character. The balance is terrific, and everyone gets valuable lines. Ty Burrell as Phil Dunphy is unrelentingly a standout, in my opinion.Though heart-warming at times, the script never becomes soppy or lecturing. The usual staple of setup-punchline of lesser sitcoms (Two Broke Girls for example, where it is relentless and tiring) rarely occurs, or when it does, often it's subtle, and thankfully avoids the overtly sexual one-liners of the execrable Two and a Half Men.Quite simply Modern family is all class and deserves every accolade it receives.But there's more than just excellent writing to the show - the performances are credible and often the delivery of lines is perfectly-timed. Even the weakest cast member (Aubry Aderson-Emmons) is now getting useful lines though she can't act at all. Furthermore, the cast isn't mired in their own, unchanging universe. They are developing, changing with time - which happens as people go through life. This ensures the show remains fresh and eminently watchable.And its greatest flaw? Like many US sitcoms that features parents and offspring, none of the children look like they had either ""parent"" contribute to their genes. And who could possibly believe the offspring of the tall and voluptuous Gloria (Sofia Vergara) and slim, athletically built Javier (Benjamin Brat) would be a short and stocky (verging on overweight) Manny (Rico Rodriguez)?It's a bit off-putting, but as I say, the rest of the show is so good, I forgive it.I cannot see any reason why this show shouldn't set records for longevity and scoop many awards along the way. Just keep an eye out for Ty Burrell - he can be insensitive, facetious, noble, sleazy, supportive, loving, and idiotic. Often in combination!"
288,"Just my cup of tea.... Hilarious comedy that suits everyone in my family. I can't express enough how much laughter modern family has brought to my living-room. Phil dunphy reminds me of Jim's dad in American pie, lovely man & unaware of how funny he is. but every character has their own unique quirks which make this side splitting hilarious. You can watch over and over again and see new bits as you've missed them from laughing the first time. I would love for modern family & the middle to do a film together. Would be a box office comedy hit! Maybe meet up on a holiday or do USA wife swap or something. Would be absolutely hilarious & fab to see the dunphys & Pritchetts on the big screen."
289,"The first American TV show I have seen.
The first American TV show I have seen.
The first American TV show I have seen."
290,It's so funny and all the acting is great. All the episodes are great. Enough said.
291,"I love Modern Family. At first, I was a bit reluctant to watch it. But I saw the entire season 1. And mind you, I LOVED IT ! Slowly by Slowly , I started watching Season 2,3,4,5,6 . And it's still amazing ! The character development is great. Actors are just too good. Characters like Phil ( portrayed by Ty Burrel ) , Gloria ( portrayed by Sofia Vergera ) ,etc. will make you laugh till you die. xD Morever, this show is appropriate for all age groups. And now Season 7 has premiered. And mind you, I love it. So I recommend you to watch this sitcom. You will not regret watching it. Watch it with your friends, family, colleagues, etc. :) :)"
292,"It's an okay show, it's just not a great show. It doesn't deserve all the praise it gets, and definitely not an 8.6 rating. The plots are very dull, and the acting is just very forced a lot of the times. It is the kind of show future grandmothers might watch. You should watch it if you're bored and there is nothing on TV but don't expect to make it your favorite show or die laughing.I appreciate that they are trying to show how the idea of what it means to be a family is changing, including interracial relationships, gay marriage, and divorced families. It is in an interesting concept, yes, but it's just not that funny of a show. It tries too hard to be funny. Like, I said, it's okay, you may smile here and there but you're not gonna crack up."
293,"I used to like this show a few years ago, but the recent seasons are filled with jokes about sex and marijuana. Are the show writers saying modern people are losers with no hobbies outside degeneracy? I can't believe this show is rated PG. It's also quite formulaic after you've watched multiple seasons, and many episodes bring things up that are immediately forgotten after the episode ends, so there is no closure."
294,The faces of the characters when they look right into the camera tell you so much and males it feel like they are literally looking at you.
295,"I was very surprised and pleased to see all our characters and story to mature in a great manner. phil talks seriously with jay, claire gets more anxiety, Luke gets more grown up, cam becomes more funny,mitch gets more girly, hailey becomes a woman, and of course lily starts talking(the more the funnier). I'm a 14 year-old from India and got all these episodes form my uncle in the us. i kinda have a crush on alex or ariel winter and greatly find her beautiful. I think her reaction towards her first kiss was true, but did not like the character of that guy. he was also kinda fat...anyway, greatly appreciate for this show as it greatly entertains me. i would love to be a part of a family like this. by the way, my favourite character is and akways will be Ty Burrell 's."
296,"First of all, this a hilarious take on a modern day family. I like the fact that all the characters are certain stereo-types of people, but then they have their own unique ways overall. My characters are: Cam (warm hearted, sensitive gay guy, who is the funniest man on T.V.), Phil (A quirky, Goofy, ""cool"" dad as he likes to call himself), and Claire (a housewife with stress who's married to Phil). Then, the characters include Gloria (a columbian woman who's married to a man who is two times her age), Jay (a divorced dad of two kids, Claire and Mitchell, who is married to Gloria), Mitchell (Boyfriend of Cam, he is a strict lawyer who's dad is Jay). Manny (a passionate boy who was Gloria's son, before she married Jay. He is my least favourite character). Lily (a little adopted girl from Vietnam, who's fathers are Mitch and Cam. Haley (a texting, shopping college girl who texts all day). Alex (a smart girl who does not like her siblings). Luke (a weird boy who jumps on a trampoline with a pogo stick, or a box on his head. Dylan (a co-star, he is Haley's bad boy boyfriend). Favourite Episodes:Season 1: Pilot Season 2: Earthquake Season 3: Election Day Season 4: Schooled/Diamond in the Rough (so far).Overall, this show is great. If you disagree, you are missing out on a truly hilarious TV show."
297,"I recently watched Season 1 on DVD. Last year, during its infant stage, I did not watch ""Modern Family"" because I have not been compelled by shows on ABC in the past. Thanks to word-of-mouth, I will be tuning in every Wednesday night to see what the show has to offer.The mockumentary, perfected by Greg Daniel's ""The Office,"" has proved to be a very versatile genre without limits. Goofy boss, Michael Scott (Steve Carell), has lead his employees through a January Booze Cruise, a beach day at Lake Scranton, multiple Christmas parties and more. So what happens when Michael Scott and the Dunder Mifflin-Sabre employees go home? ""Modern Family"" has the essence of the 'day-in-the-life' scenarios as seen on ""The Office"" at home rather than at work.""Modern Family"" has its own fearless leader, Phil Dunphy (Ty Burrell), who takes his family and ventures through birthday parties, a day sitting at the airport and troublesome family picture days. There are no boundaries for the Dunphy-Pritchett family.Creators Steve Levitan and Christopher Lloyd have put their ""Modern Family"" through actual incidences with every moment as amusing as the last.I am hooked, and as this show is so open-ended, I know that I will be watching it for years to come."
298,"I started watching this show with much expectations, just like almost everything that Ed O'Neill ever starred in since Married with children. The comedy script is very successful. Casting is great, though I think that age of Ed O'Neill finally catching up with him. Sometimes it's still possible to catch a glimpse of old Al Bundy, but he is basically looks very tired, and just wants people to let him be. There is another thing, Sofia Vergara. Don't get me wrong, she plays her part very well as passionate Columbian woman and all the comedy goes with ""gold digging"" and such. Maybe it's just me, but the problem is that she's too sexy for this comedy. I can watch episode and laugh until she enters the screen, and than I feel as I'm waiting for much more adult content. Despite her being the absolute attraction of this show, it's ironically that it's her presence on screen, is the thing that disrupts this comedy - therefore it's 8/10 and not more. Other than this, in my opinion, this comedy is better than how I met your mother - which I like, so it's definitely worth to watch."
299,This series is very bad. I didn't like it because it's too arrogant for a series I think is much better than The Big Bang Theory and Family Guy. I don't understand this measured good series.
300,Just finished watching the last episode of the series. What a show! If you're a fan of comedy/sitcom this is a need to watch. Have fun.
301,Absolutely brilliant show. Only one thing ruins it. Aubrey! 😬
302,"Although some people disagree i must say this is one of the best shows I've ever watched. The cast are funny and the writers are geniuses. I do agree that the show regressed as it went on but that's normal for most shows. I wish Luke had a bigger role but other than that I thought the show was put together fabulously. One of the best parts of having a show that goes this long and there being kids is getting to see them grow up and when you do you start to miss that whole kid aspect and that is why I think it is great that they added Joe to the show as he became one of my favorite characters once he could talk. I thought the jokes were quite thought out and although some of them were not at all realistic they were still really enjoyable to watch. One of my favorite episodes was when Claire was stuck at an airport and we saw the whole episode through her computer screen, from Phil being too lazy to get off the couch to look for Haley who they thought got married and Gloria giving Luke a mohawk because he lost a bet to Phil."
303,"Well all I wanted was to see Ed O Neil as a person who LOVES comedy and Sofia as a person who LOVES her.
Nothing else!!!!!!"
304,"To me Modern family is one of the all time great TV shows. It maintains a high standard through all 11 of its series, has some truly wonderful Characters such as Phil, Cam, Jay and Joe And no real dis likeable other than maybe Gloria who is vain, bad tempered, selfish, a control freak and is obsessive to the point of creepy with her sons but the show is so well written even she gets her funny moments. While there are the occasional guest it's nice there isn't an over reliance so it makes them even more entertaining. Stephen Merchant was a particular favourite of mine. It really is great watching the kids grow up screen and seeing how they change as they get older just as you would in real life. Overall this show is excellent I can't remember a bad episode maybe just some that were average and that only a handful and With Over 200 episodes that is some feat."
305,"If you love sitcoms that make you feel good I highly suggest this show, the first season has the best writing of any show I have seen. All the characters have something eccentric about them and the writers put that to use and end every almost episode with an heartfelt moment. Please watch this show if you haven't."
306,"I would say this is the perfect TV show if you look for fun time. Every actors did their best in this show. Even kids acted like professionals. Comic level is not adult at all, which you can watch with your family TV together. The best thing is : I never got bored watching it. I can not believe, it is finishing its final season in 2020. No doubt about it, I will see it once again. Modern Family became my family in TV box. How can I forget that?"
307,"Great mockumentarie theme, it deserves to have 1 million more seasons and an overall nine star rating, just a great show!"
308,Best show ever! Hope there are more seasons coming😍
309,"Modern family is a show that makes you skip time and is hard to stop. From all the laughter and the ""one more episode"", everyone feels apart of the crazy yet amazing families in the show. You feel part of each family and laugh, cry and enjoy every day on the show."
310,"I just finished some of the best comedy series ever made. Modern Family (created by Christopher Lloyd and Steven Levita) deals with adventures and deviations from a family that is completely distraught, but completely loving with each other. This family includes three main couples and their children, each person with their individual personality, with different ages, genders, nationalities and sexualities, justifying the title of the series, and allowing us to share their fears and insecurities, as well as their moments of glory and happiness. , even more after 11 seasons, and that's what makes the icing on the cake I would say.It is not enough the performance of all the actors and it actresses to perfectly synchronize with their characters, but we also follow the emotional, intellectual and even (in some cases) physical growth. After eleven years of accompanying the same people, and seeing them grow so much, the series manages to make you feel as if you know each one of them, as if you were part of this family, to the point that you do not want to leave them, while wanting to see them evolve. The series does not necessarily follow a linear script, instead we see several small stories over the years of its development, with details that are maintained to create the feeling of time and continuous space. Basically small leaps throughout the history of this family. One funnier than the other.Another detail in the story that has to be mentioned is the emotional appeal it provides, it seems that each episode has a moral at its end, allowing us to learn from its philosophical perceptions, victories and failures, ceasing to be just a story of comic relief. The series takes advantage of the opportunities that the personalities of its characters to tell important stories and make fun of socially relevant topics such as homophobia, sexism, xenophobia, aging, career choice, parenting, motherhood, adolescence, among others, always leaving well balanced how much responsibly criticizes and when it satirizes.The series follows the format of a mockumentary, with its characters speaking directly to the camera at times in the form of small statements, or also giving small glances to the cameras at embarrassing moments. It was certainly not the first series to use this feature, but it was definitely one of the ones that most marked its presence in the style of filming, serving as an example for other future series."
311,This show is my favorite. There life is like an real family and they have the same problems like other families. It's funny and exciting at the same time.
312,"Light. Funny. Heartwarming.This is the show I watch when I feel too stressed in life and I just want to chill. It's beautiful to watch this family, with all their quirks and misunderstandings, stay strong through the trials. Somehow, this show gave me hope for the future. I love the culture of love and acceptance in this modern family, and I believe it's an inspiration to many families as to what a family that loves one another looks like. (Loving each other despite each other's differences)I absolutely love Phil! He is the best character in the show, in my opinion. I wish we had more of Phil's-osophy! Ty Burrell is able to deliver the humor excellently, he always makes me laugh or smile even when I know what will happen!I love all the other characters as well! Such well-written stories and characters, I really felt I could connect with them. I wish the last season had more depth to it, but the first 10 seasons were so great that it doesn't even matter to me.Truly a timeless gem among TV series!"
313,"It is a really wonderful experience to see the modern family. In the first second, you will be nervous that you may not be able to bear the responsibilities of those families. In the second second, you will be amused by the naive fantasy that each character cherishes the same responsibility as you and the embarrassing situation that they hit directly. Lean back and forth. The tangled role of the previous episode makes you feel so heavy that you are so disappointed in life. After a few minutes, you are relieved that every problem you are worried about is being undertaken by everyone at the same time, and they are also deeply deeply Lovingly.
What makes people cry the most is the instinctive love and support for each other. Perhaps for a pessimist, innate instinct and acquired moral barely match the mess of life, but the real beauty of life is that we can still choose to work hard. After that, a kiss, a glance, a touch and yet not a touch, are all making a difference."
314,"I really liked the show! First 6 seasons were great..
and I just wanna say one thing, Cameron and Claire are the most annoying characters ever.. I dont know how much I hate cam!"
315,"I usually don't do reviews of a tv show but this it's the
exception, i don't have words to say how funny it is.
My mother and i looove it."
316,So the first 7 season just came on to Netflix in UK and its hilarious i love this show cant believe i never watched it sooner to bad its finished now though its amazing
317,The details of a decade add up to the end of an era. Friends can see again and again
318,The final episode wasn't for the fans but it was for the actors and actresses and it was a upsetting ending to the story and instead of it being funny it was sad. I understand the mood but the final episode wasn't worth the hype given into it and therefore its just kinda just not the ending I or my family was looking for.
319,"Modern Family may seem as a mockumentary to indulge in for entertainment purposes only, but its impact has subtly altered viewpoints regarding social issues. As a family-friendly show, it is one of the few that included a same-sex couple without limiting the characters to stereotypes. It is an inclusive show that celebrates diversity in terms of age and sexuality but lacks representation of different ethnicities. Modern Family is suitable for all age groups and also adapts to change in respect to current world issues as it does not strictly follow a fictional plot. However, the excessive product placement is distracting and intrusive and should be limited to one or two products to sustain the integrity of the show."
320,"I would give this show a 10/10 up to season 7ish but the decline in script, acting and storylines is feeling tragic.
Seems to be no continuity in the characters, slapstick ""humour"", and the wit is just not as sharp as it was.
Only plus point to the new season is they seem to have forgotten to write Lily in."
321,"When in Rome ... do as the Romans do. Have you ever felt compelled to try something ? Do you once in a while say something mean for effect because you heard that is what you got to do nowadays or- that ... Well , in the same way ya have to ignore all that too! That's the experience of the modern family...funny sad better OR worse."
322,"I love this show. It's fantastic. I love how when you watch the first episode you think they're showing three different families, but they're actually all one big family. I think the show has gotten better as it has continued throughout the years. I think I like the later seasons better because the kids grow up, which makes for even better content. I don't really have a favorite season, but if I had to choose, I would say that the later seasons are more enjoyable, for me, anyway.This show is about a big family, a modern family, if you will. We have a man in his sixties, with a foreign, young wife, who at first you think is a trophy wife, but that eventually fades, and her son. You have a family consisting of a man, woman, and their two daughters and son. And then you have two gay men and their adopted Vietnamese daughter. Everyone is related. The older man, is the woman from the three-kid family, and one of the men from the gay couple's father. So everyone's a cousin, an aunt, an uncle, a sister, a brother, a grandpa, a grandma, a father or a mother to everyone. I know that read really badly, and for that I apologise, that was the best way I could phrase it. You really need a family tree to understand better.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous."
323,"My son recommended Modern Family when it was already on season 6 so I have a lot of catching up to do. My wife and I started with episodes of season 5, really liked them and went back to the beginning. We are now near the end of season 2. For me, the writers have succeeded in giving us a whole ensemble of rounded characters, taking time and care to acquaint us with every tic and mannerism so that we feel like they are real people we actually know. From there they can quite easily convince us, however absurd the stories sometimes seem at face value. The acting is great - everyone involved seems to be into his/her character and there is apparently real chemistry. To the extent that it is almost impossible to pick favourites, though if pushed I might have to choose champion trier Phil Dunphy for his eternal optimism in the face of a barrage of first world setbacks. I have to disagree strongly with some ""hated it"" reviewers here who consider the show offensive; as I see it the writers deliberately take on a lot of social taboos in order to show us how shallow are many of our prejudices. More please."
324,"""Modern Family"" is a look at familial relations in the 21st century. The different branches of a family in the LA area go through all sorts of trials and tribulations but press on. To be certain, there are a lot of disagreements among the family members: the patriarch (Ed O'Neill) has trouble coming to grasp with his son's (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) homosexuality, the daughter (Julie Bowen) is less than pleased with her father's marriage to a feisty Colombian woman (Sofía Vergara), while the grandchildren have their own issues to deal with.I just got through binge-watching the first season. I hope to see the rest of the show. The mockumentary-style filming gives it a feeling of extra realism; sometimes I felt as if I was spying on the whole Pritchett clan! But in the end, this is a clever show. I recommend it."
