0,"It's a simple, lighthearted Christmas - love story about two, a bit nerdy and quirky adolescents finding each other through a paperchase.
The story plays with traditions without being too cheesy, just a bit.A good way to relax during these turbulent times!"
1,"When you get yourself into a teenage Christmas love story, you know what you expect to get, and this series will definitely give it to you.
Actually it's quite cute, and even though it's filled with cliches, it's original.I admit, the first episodes were better (solid 8 stars), but as the story progresses some things start to fall out of place (barely a 5 or 6 in my opinion). It's presented in a way made me expect it to be a little more introspective and serious, but at some point it evolves into a typical cheesy drama. It became disappointing at some point, but it's quite short, so it wasn't hard to finish it at all.The biggest flaw is that the characters supposed to fall in love have no actual chemistry. The whole story was quite engaging while they were apart, but as soon as they started to approach, that couple stopped making sense. Don't get me wrong, I do not dislike the characters or the acting, it's just that they do not have that ""something"" as a couple.Other things that may upset you are poor acting from some side characters or annoying cliches, but when you watch this kind of shows it's highly unlikely you can avoid those things, so I'll assume you already expect it."
2,"This tv series was addictive from the pilot. Despite how cliched it was sometimes, it was also original and refreshing. The characters weren't your average 10/10 models, but normal people who were both relatable and interesting. Netflix did very well with this cute Christmas series."
3,Loved the whole storyline for this series but why make them teenagers if you are casting people that obviously don't act or even look like teenagers. These characters clearly don't look 17. At least make them college students
4,"Okay itÂ´s Cheesy,but I LOVE Cheesy...A romantic story about two loners in NY at Christmas time. They start a
back and forth dare challenge, through a notebook at a bookstore.
And slowly they develop a deep connection but is it real or just fiction.
Will they dare to see each other face to face or is it safer to keep it on the pages.Overall a well acted feelgood for the whole family.So to all other romcom lovers ,a must see!!"
5,I do recommend this one. It's very cute and emotional and I love it!! One of the best. Really originally and refreshing!!
6,"Ok full disclosure I LOVE xmas movies or shows but this one is not your usual cheesy like nachos fest about two middle aged people falling in love setting up a Christmas carnival. It's heartfelt and genuine, allows you take a side of happy go lucky or cynical and slightly bitter (the side I'm choosing this year personally). It's also got a bit of mystery to what comes next and it's written and acted well. The leads are amazing and you definitely should try it."
7,"This series is a really good one, I was waiting for this series to be released for a long time because of midori Francis. She has portrayed a really good role as lily as well as dash. This series as over all its nice. All the color grading, script, direction, acting, I like them all."
8,"I happened upon this cute, perfect little series today. On a complete whim I went for it, I typically have things running in the background, will play on my phone, have text convos, and do other things while I watch some shows- most shows... I found myself stopping everything, rewinding, and pausing if I had to get up. I literally blew through the series in one sitting, and couldn't have loved it more! The acting, the story, the characters! It's beautiful, witty, humorous, festive, and just perfect.This is a must watch. It's like a long movie and I adored that so much about it. I loved it wasn't a great story shoved into an hour and a half long film, it took its tile to play out, and allowed transparency with the characters. I could identify with both main characters, and the supporting cast was just superb!What a well thought out series! I hate it's over, but loved every moment. Thank you, so much, for giving me an evening of comfort, and story. I needed it! Xxoo"
9,We have all seen it before. Boy meets girl. They are attracted to each other. Things get complicated and they part just to end up together.Difference here is that this one is worth watching. There is a bit of a twist as to how they meet and what their relationship is. Watched it straight through this evening.Good holiday movie.
10,"This show is now going to be a Christmas tradition for me. I am known for playing Christmas music any time of the year and the soundtrack of this series is amazing! Last Christmas, River, A Holly Jolly Christmas are some of my favorite songs and each one is played throughout the course of the show. Now, let's get into the show.Austin Abrams plays Dash, a recluse who associates Christmas with loneliness and pain. The viewer thinks of him as snippy, depressed and witty. I loved Dash's sense of humor and his intellectual curiosity. In the Strand (the bookstore in NY), it becomes apparent that Dash is not only extremely clever, but he relentlessly searches for answers to the code found in the notebook.The whole premise revolves around a notebook. Lily (Midori Francis), a radiant and intelligent teenager, devises a way for her to meet a cute boy with the help of her brother Langston. She plants the notebook next to The Catcher in the Rye in the Strand and waits for someone to go along to play the game.As someone who loves to read novels, it was so refreshing to see two teenage protagonists my same age who have the same love for reading that I do. There are so many literary references sprinkled in each episode. One character's nickname was a reference to a novel that I read in 4th grade. Every little detail in the series is so impressive, even the perfect titles for episodes. The title of the fourth episode is very appropriate.What impressed me more was how they both changed each other. The notebook becomes a character as both give each other tasks to perform. Lily tries to make Dash see the positivity in the world and Dash forces Lily to come out of her shell. By the time that we are adults, we are completely set in our ways. We have decided if we are going to be cruel, use hateful language, give compliments to others or just be kind. During our teenage years, we can truly find out who we are and who we want to be. I think that there are plenty of people who have had a toxic relationship or are currently in one, but Dash and Lily are so good for each other. They force each other to decide who they want to be. Will they continue their destructive habits or change for the better?I keep trying to think of what I can compare the show to and Notting Hill is coming to mind. However, Notting Hill does not really explore Julia Robert's character and instead focuses entirely on Hugh Grant. Both Dash and Lily are explored, but so are their social lives. Boomer (Dante Brown) is amazing as Dash's best friend, he adds moments of levity that are dearly needed just like Spike (Rhys Ifans) in Notting Hill provides. Boomer is the moral conscious of the show who acts almost like an advisor or person of wisdom. He is easily one of my favorite characters. Lily's brother Langston is very humorous and I greatly enjoyed his scenes too.Someone reading this review might be asking why I rated the show a 10/10. For me to rate a show 10/10 signifies a personal connection. I felt a personal connection to all of the music, but also to Dash and Lily. In a weird way, I am a perfect amalgam of the two of them. It's rare for me to come across two characters who love books as much as I do, love Christmas music and embrace their weirdness or their quirks. Both also have support systems, whether it is through friends or family. I love this series very, very much and I wish teenagers were depicted like this more often.I do have a very minuscule critique. The cameos of the Jonas Brothers were somewhat awkward. I realize that is a slight spoiler, but it doesn't change the story. Nick Jonas was also an exec producer which is interesting to me. I wonder if he is friends with the authors of the books or if he read the book himself and loved the concept. Their cameos were still funny and if you are a Jonas Brothers fan then you will love it.I will probably watch one of the episodes again Christmas morning. I love the idea of going through a book store in search of clues. I would definitely not mind if I were locked in one, it would be a Christmas present for me. Please watch the show! If you are a parent, it would be great to watch as a family! Thank you so much for reading my review and please be sure to suggest it to your friends and family!"
11,I have nothing more to say than how amazing and heartwarming it was. And how I binge watched it in one night just because I just couldn't stop myself from doing so. I really hope there's a second season!
12,"The first few episodes I thought it was a cute series with some promising ideas, considering it was focused on teen romance. It seemed that this series was going to be more balanced between being cheesy and an attempt of portraying teens with a more introspective point of view. But at the end the writers didn't seem to know how to write the last episodes, even though is a short series.I was hoping this was not another fiction where starting a relationship equals happiness. I was expecting for the characters to meet mid season, and see more realistic problematic related to the start of a loving relationship. But well, nope... Writers chose the easy and cheesy... These kids won't be together until the very end, and that's a happy ending. It's so unrealistic and kind of boring.The whole story felt rushed and very often cringy, but the last 3 episodes are the worse. The editing also gets bad by the end, with some voice over obviously added to some scenes to make us think characters are having conversations. Very unpolished.
Actors were good in my opinion. I have seen worse, that's for sure. Maybe the characters could have been written better? Sure. Maybe the story should have been about kids in their 18s instead of teens? Probably, but then, apparently, the writers wouldn't know how to write something dramatic without having ridiculous plots to get to the climax."
13,"It's the perfect feel good ,cozy, watch while drinking hot chocolate under the blanket ,christmas series ."
14,"Very cute, clever and endearing. Hooked from the pilot. Looking forward to seeing how this pans out. Makes a nice change from teenagers swearing, using drugs and trying to get laid - that just gets old and poisons our youth."
15,"Nice little show but it's so hard to reconcile the age of the characters and age of the actors. Lilly is supposed to be in high school? She's played by a 26 year old woman. Cute story but why not get an appropriately aged actor?(Like millie bobby brown in Enola Holmes - for once, casting gets it right - a 16 year old played by a 16 year old)"
16,"I hesitated between giving this 6 or 7 stars. I still do. The first 5 episodes are okay. Not impressive, not bad, good enough to keep watching. I watched not because the story is great but because once you start watching, you need closure. But then episode 6 till the end is a bit too long and stretched, I started getting bored and even irritated. The ending looks very artificial, too much actually. It could have been better. Not sure if this is because of the book the show is based on or the series writing. In the end those 8 rather short (under 25 minutes each) episodes look like a single romcom feature film with a lousy ending. Especially the guy, he looks artificially too soft in the last episodes and I did not find him credible anymore, unlike at the beginning. He even looks like he is high in the finale. Bizarre. I am giving 7, because it made me watched the entire season. But as I said, it is short (few episodes, and short ones). I wish I could give 6.5 stars, 7 is for the first 5 episodes only."
17,"I was cringing at every step by the cheesiness. The diversity was cute. I have so much to say about this Ridiculous sudo Disney mess, but I'm gonna give one Ridiculous concept. The reaction of how the grandfather reacted to her holding a hand with or kissing a guy or going out or whatever and completely fine with catching the gay brother having sex in the apartment, and do not give me the double stranded between the sexs bull crap, he is gay. The grandfather's reaction was Ridiculous and unrealisticto the Boy: ""I see you're having sex in my apartment with a guy, so you got over your heartbreak and ready to go back to school""to the Girl ""you went out with a boy, you will be punished and sent away to Fiji""Da F!@K! hahaha"
18,I really enjoyed it. Very relatable and puts you in the Christmas spirit.
19,This show is so sweet and wholesome. I couldn't stop watching but also wanted it to last forever. Perfect for getting in the Christmassy mood!!
20,"This whole thing was baffling to me. It starts out pretty great with a jaded loner guy who hates xmas in new york and a girl who loves xmas... who via a series of romance type events communicate in a way where they don't know each other. But then it just goes on and on and on.The main girl character is rather annoying. First I agree with the poster below who thought the actors were mismatched. The guy is rather small and the actress has a larger / rounder head making her appear to be older, in particular next to this actor. She also has self esteem issues that she repeats over and over again when she is obviously not that bad.There is nothing particularly great about Lilly and in fact she is, weird. Not in the endearing way but in the weird way. I just can't really believe after he met her, that Dash would be that into her. There are entire subplots about the families that I just don't care about and probably fill up 4 episodes."
21,"I have no words. I'm confused. I don't know what I just watched. The cheesiness was one thing, but the grandfather...oh my. Also...we're just going to forget about all the mean things Dash did?! I'm dumbfounded."
22,"I enjoyed it a lot than I expected. Being a fantasy genre lover I adored it wholly. Definitely, the concept was refreshing and lovely new characters with Christmas theme making the romance go top the cherry tree.
It was just in a way simplest beauty so it might not be everyone's cup of tea to like it but just as it said when someone knows your feeling u see the good and tryna see this show is amazing (it sounded way amazing and better in my head).
Loved when she said fairytales might be for girls but they are written by men in the first place. Loved it!! Christmas always comes with some awesome romances."
23,Would've been better a little cleaner. I felt like they had to throw in every pc scene they could however they could. The story would've been better without all that pc fluff and as a movie. The story itself was cute but would never let my 14 year old watch it.
24,"I just saw Austin Abram in a recent very angsty young-adult romance entitled ""Chemical Hearts,"" and his Dash here was more or less the same type of loner guy. As for Midori Francis, it was always refreshing to see a lead character of Asian descent in an American series. Her Lily was lovable with her delightful oddness and effusive optimism. Even if the series following the usual rom-com formula, the chemistry between Abram and Francis made sure we followed their relationship all the way to finale. The dramatic snag in Episode 7 might have been inevitable, but it made Episode 8 too irresistible to miss.This cheerful holiday mini-series had all the trappings and tropes of a typical Christmas rom-com, only it was expanded to eight easy-to-digest episodes of just about 25 minutes each. What made this one very interesting was that we knew things Dash and Lily did not know, and we enjoyed following their long winding process of getting to know each other only from what they wrote in the notebook. Their challenges may seem silly, shallow and juvenile, however they were actually pushing each other to break out from their respective comfort zones."
25,"D&L hit all the Manhattan hot spots circa Christmas in their little game of cat and mouse. How about a visit to scenic Staten Island or the Bronx? I made it through episode 4. My wife and daughter are watching #5 right now. I've seen Hallmark Christmas movies better (and worse) than this. I love Fred Savage (we go in and we grind!), but I did not love what I saw of this. Just not for me."
26,"Could this happen in real life? Possibly, but it would be a logistical nightmare... But that's why Christmas miracles exist...If you watch this knowing and believing in Christmas miracles then you'll love it...It ticks all the boxes"
27,Terrible cheesy cliched mess of a series .... Around the 100th show/movie I have seen with an on the way to the airport climax ..... 3 hours of my life I will never get back
28,"Its a different show and I'll give credit to writers for that but I have to say that this season could have been wrapped up in four episodes. I enjoyed first 2 episodes and last 2 episodes, but to be honest, in the middle it was just waste of time for me."
29,"I just binged this show, so here I go:
In general, this was fun to watch. It has cliches, but the premise is pretty interesting and fun to watch. Just some keypoints for more structure:Characters: I like most of the characters, the biggest issue is that the main characters are not the greatest. I have some issues with Lily. She's the stereotypical ""Not like other girls"", she doesn't have any female friends (on that matter, not any friends at all, but more on that later), which I really don't like. Girls are constantly portayed as bad beside from her, which is just...not great. She doesn't have any friends, which I don't think is realistic, even the ""Weird"" people usually have friends, as a fellow introvert and bookworm, I can indeed confirm I actually have friends. I do like her character growth in this
Dash is a bit better, and I actually think he becomes more likable over the course of the story. I don't love him, but he was quite enjoyable to watch. He's not super fleshed out, but he's ok.
I like the side characters quite a lot, Sofia is great, and the ending made me really happy for her. In general, the side characters are pretty cool.The story/Pacing: Nothing insanely creative, but intruiging enough to keep watching. Especially the first three episodes are really good, after that is definitely gets worse. You could've wrapped this up in maximum 6 episodes, and it would've been better. I started to become a bit bored around episode 4, and I was already in too deep to stop, so I finished it.The Romance: It starts of good, but their chemistry isn't that good, which makes the whole story a bit...pointless?After I've mentioned quite a lot of criticism, I enjoyed this show. It's a cliche christmas show, but if you're into that, you're going to enjoy this one as well. It's also quite short, so even if you didn't absolutely love it, you didn' waste that much time. Is definitley worth giving a try!"
30,Not fun to watch with my 14 year old kid. Cute story minus the naked brother and boyfriend in all the episodes.
31,I don't believe they put Joni Mitchell's masterpiece River to that cheesy thing
32,I couldn't get past the first seven minutes. Didn't keep my interest no matter what. Blah.
33,This series is so bad and horrendous both me and my girlfriend want to die watching this
34,LOVED IT!!! binge watched all the episodes in few hours. Do not think twice just watch it I am sure you'll love it.
35,"This is perfect holiday heart-warmer. If you like or are in the mood for a sweet romance, I highly recommend. Also helps if you're a lover of literature :D.I hope they wrap this series up nicely. I already love all of the characters. 1 or 2 more seasons ought to do it, and I hope we get them soon!!"
36,"People in bed together?
Lying to parents?
Underaged at clubs?
Leaving home in the middle of the night?
This could have been really good WITHOUT the added token cliches and poor decisions.
Hate that all shows seem to have to have a standard checklist these days. It is getting so boring."
37,If Disney and the hallmark channel had a baby that was a little edgy it would be this show. If you're into that kind of stuff with Xmas twist then you'll love it. I did watch the entire season and it's not bad but just cheesy and cliche while also a little predictable. Seems like something that would be a hit for younger teens. I don't get the perfect 10/10 reviews it's getting.
38,"Seriously, don't miss it. Very well written, kept me hooked throughout the entire series. The acting is good, believable. But it is a genre you must enjoy, otherwise don't watch it - Just don't! If you're a romantic like me, this series will surprise you in a surprising, emotional cute story in Christmas time. Don't miss it! I mean it. It feels we are living in a time where this stories are underrated so I've been waiting for this for a long time. Let the child in you breath for God's sake, because when we're teenagers, stories like this really do happen."
39,I didn't expect this to be this sweet kind of a show. It definitely has the potential and is successful in setting some feel good tone to it. The wintery Christmas vibes are insane and makes me feel happy. Fast paced yet exceptionally romantic plot direction and ofc the soundtrack is up to the mark. It's certainly everything you wanna binge watch right now.
40,"This had me crying tears of joy! It was so cute! It's a great, short, Christmas T.V. show! I'm gonna be honest, I loved it! And not just because Dash and Lily are attractiveð"
41,This show is so much enjoying!!! Cast is so much cutee and the story is enjoyable
42,"Dash & Lily - B+ (Memorable)Perfect holiday show, you can binge watch during holidays. It has enough sugar, and brains to keep you hooked into watching till the end. It is far better than Netflix holiday movies parade dropping every week.The leads are charming along with supporting cast especially Sophia and Bummer. Though, Not sure why they would cast a 26 years old actress to play 17 years old. The guy atleast look like a teenager but Lily at times looks like an old actress trying hard to sound like an underage teenager. Sometimes due to story line she has to keep reminding us she is 17 but unfortunately she doesn't look like 17 years old. That's the only thing sticks out like soar thumb at times, but otherwise it was thoroughly entertaining."
43,"This was a cute show. Going into it, I thought it was about two people in their early twenties, not teens. In the beginning, I was worried that Dash was going to be that intolerable guy who thinks he is better than everyone and quotes authors and poets (you know, cause teens always do that). Luckily this behavior didn't seem to last beyond the first episode. The story was sweet. One gripe I had with this show is how the lifestyles of teens are portrayed. There is parental supervision when it fits the plot, but when it doesn't, there are kids having these nice NYC apartments to themselves, having the Morgan Library to themselves on Christmas Eve and openly drinking in a bar. The show was good on its own, it didn't need these unrealistic situations to add anything. The momentum of the show was great up until the last few episodes. Its almost as if there wasn't enough content to fit into all of the episodes, so toward the end the writers just started creating more conflict to consume time. Overall, I enjoyed it and I would probably watch it again."
44,It made me emotional and kinda happy so it was good
45,I love love love Christmas. So I'm loving the festive setting of this. It is overall quite predictable but there are some unexpected turns every now and then which I like. Also have to praise the Asian representation in this! The main characters are very likable so I'm actually care about what happens to them. It's short and fast paced so quite easy to finish. Can't wait for season 2.
46,This is embarrassingly bad. Horrible script. Over the top clichÃ©. An 8 year old could have written better dialogue.
47,Super cute show but they should've set it with 20-something college students rather than teenagers as it seems unrealistic that 17 year olds would be living these lives. Nonetheless it was fun to watch and got me in the festive spirit!
48,"Don't expect any twists and stuff this is a feel good christmas teen love story. The first episodes were fun to watch but when they met it just spiralled and ended just ok. I like the characters but I just didn't feel much of the supposed ""love"". They were really cute chasing each other though but yeah nothing mushy kind of love you feel in your heart. I recommend for one watch since it is an easy watch for christmas."
49,"I watched in a row and was so sad when it was over. I really enjoyed it! It's light hearted, sweet and touching. I loved the characters, they did great. I hope there will be another season as soon as possible. :) I will definitely read the books!"
50,Watching two wealthy kids running around complaining about everything in life is not enjoyable. The story was also boring and slow.
51,"This new series from Netflix is adorable! full of happiness,and realities during Christmas. I love the story and I love how the series gives advice & motivation to viewers. There is just one problem for me, I didn't like that the cast looks like 25+ and they're portraying a 17 year old highschool student, Especially Lily she doesn't look like a 17 year old teenager, I even thought that they already graduated college. But overall, I love the series!"
52,"I have to say I have been extremely disappointed with most new Christmas films, especially on Netflix. Christmas Prince induced my gag reflex, The Princess Switch served as nothing but background noise, and the list goes on. I was hesitant to give Dash and Lily a shot but thought it would be nice to have some holiday sounds on while I worked. I was hooked after the first episode!The premise is based on two teenagers falling in love through written letters in a notebook. You've Got Mail fans will enjoy this for sure. There is also a great coming-of-age plot where Dash and Lily help each other overcome personal obstacles during the holiday season. It gets cheesy at times but Netflix did a good job of knowing their Christmas Cheese limits and when to pull back. It definitely is not as bad as a hallmark movie and maybe more akin to Love Actually.I'm going to save the last 4 episodes for closer to Christmas time which is how much I am enjoying this series. It's not perfect but definitely give it a shot!"
53,I've never read the book but now it's ok my TBR list. When I saw the trailer I knew this would a sweet addition to the YA genre. The main characters due a excellent job or portraying the opposite of each other. A Grinch and a Christmas Enthusiast. The idea that you can convey your feelings through a notebook isn't new but the setting is. And each transaction the two go through to get to the end result is. The push and pull of each to get them to see the others side of life was compelling and sweet but not overly done.
54,"Light, feel good story. Lovely acting. It might've been like any other predictable romantic comedy from the 90s or 2000s.However, this one is completely refreshing, not least because of all the diversity and general woke-ness of the characters.Even if you're bored of cliched Christmas stories, you'll enjoy this one! But if you're a fan of Christmas themed stories, then you're in for a treat with Dash & Lily. ð"
55,I NEED a sequel! I REALLY DO! The only reason I gave it 9* instead of 10 is because the penultimate episode pissed me off and there were some plot holes.
56,"It's a truly sweet show. I didn't binge this all at once, but I watched all the episodes in a spread of few nights. The story is like a Nora Ephron style-esque romance between the two characters, Dash and Lily, communicating only via notebook. They challenge each other to step out of their comfort zones and fall for each other in the process, despite never meeting most of the time.
Both leads, Austin Abrams and Midori Francis, were great and had great chemistry even though barely sharing screen time. Seeing New York in all of its festive gleam was a delight. As a long time New Yorker, it felt very wistful watching when the city was bustling and alive with crowded people. The supportive cast was solid as well, including Boomer (the ultimate best friend), and some of Lily's family members Langston, her grandpa and her aunt Ms. Basil E.
The show plays out like some sort of fairytale,(appropriately titled half way through the show with episode 4, Cinderella) and it also acknowledges that the two build up each other perfect versions in their heads, leading to eventual let-downs and disappointment.
Very well made and acted and it kept mostly true to the book by the same name. Overall, a solid piece of holiday content and one I look forward to rewatch every holiday season."
57,"I'm watching it twice because I loved it. Maybe because it's light and cheesy and that's what you expect on a Christmas movie/serie. Of course it's not perfect, but I'm watching it again so I give it 10 for that. Don't usually see things twice. I liked it a lot."
58,"I gave it a 7 just for the Christmas theme, but it's not for 16+"
59,"I binged watched it within a day. It's very easy to watch. Simple, yet very pleasant story. It feels you with the Christmas spirit. Just the right amount of cheesy. It's a very warm tv show. I love it."
60,"I watched it with my sister and we both had a headache from watching it. My sister got nauseous while watching it. For me the first episode was fine until I saw lily... she is a bad actors I thought she was going to be cool and mysterious but she acts like a child i mean look at her clothes is there anyone who wears clothes like this in 2020? I like dash he's cool but kinda rude to everyone also he looks like Timothee chalamet if ur not wearing glasses and from far away.I want to talk about her brother and his boyfriend, THEY WERE THE MAIN CHARACTERS!!! I love the aunt I wish to be her. Dash's friend is bae I loved him. Also why is lily obsessed with Christmas like chill girl. And hangs out with older people??in conclusion I hate this show except for the brother and his boyfriend and dash's friend and the aunt"
61,"Trying to get into the holiday spirit, plus finding a half hour show I can watch on the elliptical, I thought, ""I wonder if Netflix has anything."" Well, it's like they heard me...THIS was on the homescreen and it was just what I was looking for. I ended up watching the 1st and 2nd episodes back to back and stayed on the exerciser longer than planned, too. It's fun and a little suspenseful and the characters are likable."
62,Austin mate it's not cool to gargle ever line. It does not make you sound interesting it's just annoying and a turn off oops turned off after the first episode. Teen drama at its worst
63,Entertaining enough for an easy binge. My biggest gripe it that the show is constantly going out of its way to remind the audience that the characters are teenagers. The plot would have been more believable if they were college kids and not in high school. It's a good filler show while you're waiting for some other releases.
64,I loved this show!!! It's a feel good series that will bring smiles and laughter. I'm recommending this to everyone I know.
65,"Such an uplifting movie. It is so well done, the storyline is really great - not your usual story. And it definitely puts you in a great mood. Watched it in one go! Will watch it again for sure. Can't say it enough - it's great!"
66,"I'll admit I was hesitant because the main characters are teenagers so I thought the show would be immature, shallow and angsty. I was pleasantly surprised! This little series is well casted, well written, well acted, sweet, sincere and perfect for the holidays! There's no hoke or camp which I truly appreciate! It's simply a clever well done show worth watching!"
67,"This mini tv series was really adorable. I felt so good while I was watching it. And the final episode was so emotional. Also, the main actor was surprinsingly good. I really loved his acting. I will definetely watch his other movies.P.S: You should read the book, too. It is really cute and would be a nice Christmas gift."
68,"This show is absolutely sweet in the most perfect way possible, it is beautifully shot, the Christmas feel is the icing on the cake, the characters and actors are enjoyable to watch and in the end you're finding yourself rooting for Dash and Lily! I genuinely hope you watch this show, its a feel good Christmas love story I think we all need right now! :)"
69,"It is clear that the actors who play the main roles are much older. The male main character looks like he's 35, not 17... And, the story... story is as if it was made by someone without a little sense..."
70,"Dash and Lily on Netflix is seriously the best. By far the best Christmas content I've watched in years! May be even the best tv series I've watched this year. It's funny, romantic, cute, heartwarming. It's ultimate feel-good and magical vibes all over. I love the score, soundtrack, cinematography and how it captures Christmas magic in New York City. You watch each episode and get lost in this joyous tale. With the short 20-30 min episodes finishing it in one night was seamless. Like one long movie! Even my dad and sister's longtime boyfriend watched it (they never watch rom coms) and loved it. We all watched the first few episodes together and then they went out of their way to watch the rest on their own. That says a lot for two men who would probably go for an action movie! Ugh I love this series so much. Also, the female lead is Asian and the actress is queer in real life (yay for representation!). The main guy was on This is Us and is so dreamy as Dash, complete opposite of his other character. Fine actor!
Ok off to watch the series a third time and get lost in its wonder and glory.
Spoilers (favorite scenes): I LOVED the scene where lily shows dash dyker heights and tells him she believes in him with the believe lights turning on. It was all so perfectly timed. And the last scene in the iconic Strand bookstore. WOW THE FEELS. And when dash told lily to visit Grand central. I was in dreamland too."
71,"This will ""literally"" make you smile. It is not the typical teen/young adult love story. Some of it is sappy, but much hits the sweet spot. New York City is more than a setting, as well, and is actually a character. Go into it with no expectations and you might be pleasantly surprised. Good job on directing, Fred Savage!!"
72,"Fun actors. Fun premise. Fun locations. Fun timeline.but ...Drama over reality... For example, several times a cellphone would have solved a predicament.Check list of PC situations... gets old and obvious.And the writers couldn't seem to move past using vapid vocabulary here and there. Our language has SO many great words. Stop using the ones that gross us out, well those of us who still see the imagery of words and feel cheated when a clever one could have been used instead. There's already too much ugly in the world, don't add to it. I realize this goes against my ""drama over reality"" complaint since in real life the language would have been gobs worse, but this film had a chance to give us a romp w/o patties and it chose not to.Another pet peeve... Surprises. If you think about it, they're more for the giver than the receiver. If you care about someone, you don't leave them worrying, you let them in on what's what. There are other ways to produce suspense."
73,I don't want to spoiler anything in this review... But this story just fits from beginning till the end! I can tell you so much more but you really should watch it and see it for yourself! The story line will be a rolercoaster (as long as you like rollercoasters) from the beginning!The amazing way how the interactions happen in this story and how does change the life of those characters! It is just so wonderful to be part of that journey... Maybe it will even change you?
74,"First of all I have to say, I don't tend to watch whole tv series as soon as I see it, I saw this pop up on Netflixs earlier and to be honest thought it was a film, didn't realise when it said ' next episode ' and I was so happy to realise it was a tv series, I love tv series much more as they can tell a story better sometimes and this, this was told in a fantastic way! Several hours later and I accidentally watched the whole tv series ( ops ) and loves every minute of it, sure it's cheesy and different however it's a great bit of cheesy - the story telling was great and I am one of loving a tv series that has narrating within it, it weirdly maybe me think of another tv series from its good qualities (not the serial killing part) .This is well worth a watch and I hope this gives everyone great joy on watching, I will be watching again with my partner. If you love a good love story with some comedy - this is it, great watch! Brought a smile to my face and a glow to my heart. Thanks"
