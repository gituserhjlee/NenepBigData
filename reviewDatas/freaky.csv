0,"It's a little late for a Halloween/slasher movie, but it looks like they really wanted that Friday the 13th release date. And to my surprise, this was way more fun than I thought it would be.Just when you think it's another generic, teen angst, alcohol-drinking, sex-thirsting movie, the kills start happening. Not only were they gory, but they were also quite creative. The movie just knows exactly what it is and never takes itself too seriously. Plus, watching mean bullies die in horrific ways was just so satisfying to watch. (Hopefully, I'm not the only one...)More importantly, Vince Vaughn is the reason you should watch this. You have this 6-foot-5 giant of a man running around as a teenage girl. From the way he speaks to his subtle mannerisms, it was just plain funny. He's the man-- or the woman, I mean.As for the negatives, it mostly has to do with the writing. Basically, everything with the family was boring and predictable. It was probably the most generic part of the movie. They lazily tell you everything you need to know as soon as they're introduced.I also hate it when movies portray a character as ""ugly"" or ""undesirable"" and the actress is anything but. In other words, they want you to believe that Kathryn Newton's Millie is some kind of weirdo loser, but I just never bought it.There's also a disconnect between Newton's Millie, who is shy, timid and quiet, and Vince Vaughn's Millie, who is girly-girl, talkative and fun. They just felt like different people. There's also, sort of, two endings. There was the natural conclusion, and everything was good, but then it goes on for another 10 minutes, and it was just unnecessary.Despite some annoying tropes and poor writing, this was a fun, self-aware movie with some horrific kills and really funny body swap moments.Score: 7 out of 10
Overall: GoodRecommended for: Fans of Vince Vaughn, fans of Freaky Friday with a slasher twist, or fans of watching scumbag bullies get what's coming to them.Thanks for reading!"
1,"This movie surprised me. I watched this at the Sitges Film Festival, expecting to see just another slasher, but this is something else. The comedy is just right, the violence is too good, and Vince Vaughn just kills it, quite literally. Overall, a great flick to have some laughs and to watch some great gore scenes."
2,"I loved it. Vince knocks it out of the park as a teenage girl and all the characters really pulled off their scripts. The point of movies is to entertain and I was so entertained during this film.
The issue is you can't take this movie seriously. It is not meant to be a realistic slasher. It's just an entertaining fun teenage horror comedy and a damn good one!
Not to forget, the very talented, very beautiful and very great Kathryn Newton who made a great serial killer Barbie. Top work from her and her co stars!"
3,"I absolutely love body-swapping comedies, such as Freaky Friday and The Hot Chick. I also absolutely love horror slashers like Halloween, Friday the 13th, and Scream. To combine these different genres was a dream come true. I'm glad it's getting such positive reviews. It deserves it. Kathryn Newton was great and so fun to watch her go from a sweet shy vulnerable high school girl named Millie, to bloodthirsty serial killer. Vince Vaughn was great too. It was also fun to see him as an evil killer, turn into Millie and acting like a teenaged girl. The gore and killings were awesome and brutal.Millie Kessler is an average high school girl. Her family is going through a tragedy because of her father dying a year ago. She gets picked on by her peers and even the teachers. The night before the Homecoming dance, she's sitting in the parking lot and the Blissfield Butcher begins to attack her. He stabs her with an ancient Aztec dagger that he stole and that makes them switch bodies.On Friday the 13th, the Butcher wakes up as Millie in her girly bedroom, and Millie wakes up as the Butcher in his gory grotesque lair. Millie must convince her friends that it's her in the killer's body and switch bodies back in 24 hours, or the switch becomes permanent. Throughout the day, the Butcher in Millie's body goes on a bloody rampage. It's so fun to watch. If you love body swapping comedies, and gory horror slashers, I would definitely recommend FREAKY!!!"
4,"I wasn't expecting much & usually avoid these types of comedic horror movies. But, it surprised me & I liked it. Vince Vaughn did a great job acting like a teenage girl. It was a good mix of humor & slasher movie. The cheese factor was a lot less than I thought it would be.....and for me, that was great. I'm glad I took a chance on this movie, it was worth it."
5,"When I saw the trailer firbthis I was cautiously optimistic that it could be ok. It looked like a Scream meets Freaky Friday. Well, it is that but it is really not very good.Of course this type of horror comedy is not to be taken seriously but it is not very funny or scary at all. The premise is just as the trailer shows. A high school girl gets attacked by a serial killer and they switch bodies. That's it.The serial killer the Blissfield Butcher is played by Vince Vaughn. The high school girl Millie is played by Kathryn Newton. Millie is attacked by the killer with a sacred Aztec dagger that has the power to switch their bodies. The fun of the film is watching each of them adjust in their new bodies. Vaughn does a good job with a very thin script. Newton just goes around looking evil. The film is gory but nothing we've never seen before in much better films. It has a couple of decent chuckles but again been there seen that.The film wants to convince you that it is really cool and edgy but it really isn't.Lazy film.Grade: C-"
6,"Sure it might be cheesy and a little cliche, but there's a good mix of gore, laughter and jump scares.The movie is well paced, well acted and has interesting characters.If you enjoyed Happy Death Day, you'll likely enjoy this one too"
7,"Vince is brilliant, and so are the majority of the cast, but the script/story is pretty poorly done."
8,Was I the only one that found this stupid and unoriginal. I went in hyped about this movie but sadly is disappointed. That's all I gotta say.
9,"This movie is exactly what you expect it is going to be and it was fun from the start to the end.
Actors are quite good, it is funny and gory with some emotional scenes thrown every now and then. Gotta give it to the lead actors, they did a great job.
Storyline is straightforward, but the cinematography, acting and script keeps you hooked to the screen.
I would add that this movie is quite bold in a good way, and challenges some norms but I loved it. I wouldn't be surprised if it was trashed by conservatives.In summary it is a must watch."
10,"It finally crystalizes with Freaky, the latest in the kind of high concept genre cinema Hollywood used to release on the regular (with slightly higher budgets) from Christopher Landon following his two Happy Death Day movies that this filmmaker is a bit more rote when it comes to Horror than he is totally adept and a natural (or at least has a clever sensibility on the regular) as a comedy writer and director. He takes this concept we have seen so often - echoes of the obvious Freaky Friday, sure, and even for a couple of minutes Big, but I see a lot more of Face/Off once this teenage girl is embodied by a serial killer and that's as high a compliment I could think to grant - and uses his R rating for hilarious bloodshed, and then some (body parts do come apart at points) while taking the poss out of what it means to be a somewhat neglected/bullied teen girl... Or Vince Vaughn.Vaughn hasn't been this funny in (checks calendar, holy sheet man) 15 years, which is when Wedding Crashers gave him that opening ten minutes of raucous insanity with some other moments of inspired dialog. Here he commits completely to embodying this type, but also makes her human as well. And when Catherine Newton is swapped with this ""Blissfield Butcher"" (and of course the town is called Blissfield), she especially goes to town, perfects the Kubrick stare and gets to have fun being the violent psychotic type (who, you know, can get knocked around a lot being a teenage girl). Where Landon falters is with the casting and writing of Millie's co-patriots, who are (Patton Oswalt voice) GAY BEST FRIEEEND and sorta woke black girl, and in those brief but notable moments when it means to be more heartfelt (a scene between Butcher/Millie and the mother in a dressing room between doors is exoected) doesn't work as well as it should, which is where Death Day has the edge.Where it excels is as a self-conscious and knowing horror comedy, which occasionally goes for drawing out suspense and shocks and is by no means bad at it but nothing we haven't seen before (keen lighting for that, uh, haunted indoor mini-golf set, I think) and draws out giant belly laughs at the kinds of jokes and dialog and even physical comedy that logically has been done but is executed with enthusiasm and two very game performers. It'll be an ideal party movie for the teens of many stripes for a while and gives me more of what I'd want out of a Scream sequelboot than I know Ill get when the time comes."
11,I was hyped for this movie but to be honest it's pretty bad. The acting is terrible. None of the main characters have any charisma to carry the film.
12,"A good watch with the right company. The movie though had no story. Same suspense throughout the runtime, predictable. Has so much potential to be a cult classic, unfortunately they failed to identify that. A great date night!"
13,"I expected more comedy from this movie
Was a very boring movie"
14,"I saw this movie in cinemas with my friends, and we all loved it. it has an interesting plot, interesting characters, great comedy, amazing gore, and a good ending.
if i were to complain, i would have to complain a bit about the ending. the ending is good, but it feels like a last minute add-on. the ending makes me think that there was another ending for this movie, but they scrapped it last minute. Other then that, it's a great movie. perfect if you want somthing scare to watch."
15,"Pretty great body swap movie- and a great combination of horror and typical high school/raunchy teen comedy. Vince Vaughn is hilarious and at times scary, depending on who he is at the time. The director, Christopher Landon has a real knack for this usually very difficult genre of horror comedy- he really is able to check all the important boxes for each genre without losing tempo. Highly recommended for those who enjoy the genre. One note- the death scenes are not for the squeamish. They are, at times absurd, but grounded, making them feel realistic. They are also very creative, graphic and at times, elaborate. So, you know, 'viewer discretion advise'..."
16,"Was a very entertaining movie, great cast and nice spin to a very used idea. The only problem I had with it was there was a lot of man bashing. It was subtle, but it's in there. If they would've just kept that BS out of there it would've been an awesome movie."
17,"Wow the big screen movies are back with Freaky a brilliant movie to see in cinemas. blumhouse did well with this, it nails the slasher genre and the comedy so well. horror comedy is hard genre to do but Freaky nails it! go watch this in theaters!"
18,"This movie is everything a horror fan could also for. It has its meta moments, it's scary and Friday the 13th-esque, but also funny. And it's with the times but pays homage to classic horror movie antics. It's so fun. So well written and exudes many powerful moments. If you love Happy Death Day, you'll love this!"
19,"It's nothing spectacular but it's definitely a ton of fun. Vince Vaughn is the star of the show, playing a teenage girl and hamming it up. He's great in this and a scene stealer.It's surface level with every character stereotype cranked up to 11, to the point of being caricatures; it's at times distracting but works in the context of this cheesy movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.Was hoping for a little more horror/murders but it keeps the movie light and comical instead of threatening and tense.This is a fun one to see with some friends and a bucket of popcorn."
20,"Freaky is by far, one of the most entertaining slasher films of the 21st century. The plot is very simple, and has been done in many films, but to have the body swap premise in a horror film keeps things very interesting. Unlike most body swap films, the acting is very consistent between the two actors. Vince Vaughn is hysterical as a shy teen girl, and Katherine Newton was very convincing as a crazed killer, she definitely had the more impressive performance out of the two. The movie delivers a pretty good amount of humor and the kills are nice and gory. For fans of the genre, Freaky is definitely a refreshing and enjoyable film."
21,Hilarious and Gory! Saw it with friends and had a great time! We laughed a lot. It's got some iconic characters in it too.
22,"Compared to ""Black Christmas (2019)"" which is the last Friday the 13th film I saw in theatres from Blumhouse, ""Freaky"" left me wanting more instead of making me make dash to the exit.This was a great slasher film that exceeded my expectations. I had expected this Blumhouse Production to be another miss and make me feel life's regrets of trying to see a new horror film on Friday the 13th. However, this fresh take on ""Freaky Friday"" was most welcome. It was a vibrant display of kill or be killed with comedy being a side note throughout, and not in the absolute classic, cheesy way that older slashers offer. My initial reservations were with Vince Vaughn knowing that he was a comedic actor. Those reservations were unnecessary as Vaughn playing a teenage girl was hilarious throughout as he tries to convince those around him that he's not the Butcher. On the opposite side of the spectrum, Kathryn Newton who played Millie, did a fantastic job of carrying the ominous presence of the Butcher to high school where the killing continues. By the end you'll be left laughing one moment and in the same scene cringing at the acts of violence.Overall, a really great slasher/comedy that I would recommend seeing in theatres on any given night. I went in expecting a 4/10 or less type of film and left with double the score and not apologizing to myself for sitting there for two wasted hours."
23,"Never a dull moment in this! A great mix of comedy and horror! To boot, the acting is spectacular. Vince Vaughn and Kathryn Newton are excellent in their reverse roles! The laughs are almost unending, and there is plenty of gore and tension as well! Definitely a fun watch that I would certainly watch again!"
24,"A teenage girl is stabbed by a serial killer with a magical knife he stole from one of his previous victims and their souls switch bodies and they have only 24 hours to get back into their original bodies before they're stuck that way forever.Freaky takes a little while to warm up, but once it does, it's off to the races. Vince Vaughn has never been funnier and Kathryn Newton makes for a very likable heroine and also manages to pull off the sociopathic serial killer stuff once she's switched bodies. It's well paced with just enough laughs, gore, and even heartfelt moments to make for a memorable ride."
25,"Centered on director-driven productions that are low-budget and made fast, Blumhouse productions share similar values in the vein of Roger Corman productions, which give their films an old school efficiency to them.In the case of Freaky, the script gets straight to the point. In the beginning horror movie section, the film practically holds a clipboard and just proceeds to check everything off before you get to say hello, ""That's our villain. That's the girl. That's her problem. This is her family and their recent tragedy. These are her friends."" Happy Death Day director Christopher Landon executed in an intentionally cheesy self-aware meta fashion. Vince Vaughn's serial killer wears an Incan mask that resembles Jason Voorhees. The tongue-in-cheekiness is intentionally cheesy and funny at times, other times it is just cheesy and formula.At the point of the body switch, the genre shifts to being a straight-up situation comedy. The irony and the jokes are in place but they are not tight enough nor pushing its clever premise far enough to get maximum laughs. Vince Vaughn is hilarious playing out the body swap gag but isn't given enough to do because he is always hurried along to the next scene. I laughed a few times but didn't leave with a full stomach of seeing Vince Vaughn acting like a high school girl.Originally titled Freaky Friday the 13th, which is actually a better title, the film never tonally reconciles the meta-horror and the Freaky Friday family comedy elements together. At times, when Millie as Vince Vaughn is running around the high school with her friends searching for the killer while hiding from the adults, it feels like a Goosebumps movie. When there are brutal killings, it is R-rated graphic to an extent of where I feel like I am supposed to laugh at the violence. I can't quite give an R-rated dark comedic belly laugh at a brutal killing cause of the PG-13 nature embedded into the context.If director Christopher Landon said the point was to have both the PG-13 and R-rated elements together, I would say fine, but the script and the jokes have to be clever enough to make that meta tone consistent. It is as if the speed of how fast they made this movie has compromised the potential of its own premise. There is a great premise here. I do think the humor and the tone could have been drafted some more and chisel the dialogue.I know there's a better version of this that could have been made."
26,"A high-concept film combining elements of films like ""Freaky Friday"", ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Scream"", ""Freaky"" is entertaining enough for people who don't mind the mingling of disparate genres. If you don't like taking liberties with genres, well, then, for a family friendly comedic Disney film, see the original ""Freaky Friday"", which starred a very young Jodie Foster (15 years old). For a straight horror film see ""Friday the 13th"". ""Scream"" is a self-aware slasher film which had fun with the genre and its tropes.For fans of slasher slash horror films, ""Freaky"" is par for the course as far as the gore goes for MA 15+ films. The plot involves two people unintentionally swapping bodies: a middle-aged man who is a serial killer (played by Vince Vaughn) and a teenage high school girl (""Millie"", played by Kathryn Newton). I can't say that ""Freaky Friday"" started off that genre of story but it's where I first came across it as a child, watching rental videos. Now, obviously, you're wondering how on Earth two people can swap bodies. You're overthinking things! Just go with it!The film is amusing enough in the comedy department. Can you imagine a cute teenage girl trying to be a serial killer? Absurd, right? Well...not as sublimely ridiculous as an even younger ""Hit-Girl"" (played by Chloë Grace Moretz when she was 12 years old) in the gloriously violent superhero film ""Kick-Ass"". When ""Freaky"" is not being bloody or sexual (sex scenes are minimal in this film but there is sexual talk and moments of sexual menace), it does later come across as a comedic Disney action film.The only person whose name I knew in the cast was Vince Vaughn, which I knew for his work in comedy films (right now I can't think of a film that I've seen with him in it but I'm not a film nerd). I can't say that I could have come up with his name to star in a film in which he plays a serial killer whose body is inhabited by a teenage girl. However, if someone had mentioned his name I'm sure that I would gone along with it as an appropriate choice. It's hard to say what names that I would have come up with for this role. Steve Carrell, perhaps, though he is terminally short and one scene would have been weakened with a short man doing it (the scene with Vince and a teenage boy in a shower room at high school).Whilst you get scenes of bloody horror, you do get meta humour and sociological satire. Millie is not a stereotypical teenage girl like you see in Hollywood films. She's attractive but bland, like her female best friend, Nyla (played by Celeste O'Connor). Her male best friend, Josh (played by Misher Osherovich) is gay and sassy and is the most interesting of the three of them. He comes up with some of the meta humour and sociological observations in the film.""Freaky"" is not a film that takes itself seriously but that being said, it does its mocking with a straight face. Vince Vaughn perhaps best exemplifies that. Playing a teenage girl, he is almost subtle with it. He doesn't over-egg the pudding of his performance. In fact, there is a really 'interesting' scene with his character in the back seat of a car with a teenage boy who Millie has a crush on. The two actors in this scene must know how absurd the film is at this point but they bravely push on. Vince could quite possibly earn an Academy Award for Best Actor just for this scene!I don't know if there are plans for any sequels to this film, turning it into a franchise. That being said, if they do plan sequels, I'd be surprised if they surprised me with what direction they wanted to take things. I've seen the first few ""Friday the 13th"" films and I've casually read about some of the further sequels its spawned. It's hard to imagine any sequels to ""Freaky"" breaking new ground, whatever direction they wanted to take things. On the topic of being predictable and I don't mean this in a negative sense, I could tell what was going to happen at the climax of a scene where Millie is trying to regain her body from the serial killer. I feel pleased with myself for having being able to recall the scene which presaged that moment. Maybe I should rewatch that scene though to make sure that it makes sense and there are no plot holes in it.Before I forget, there must be some dark wish-fulfilment occurring in this film. I don't have a degree in English Literature, so I can't posit in detailed terms Freudian notions of transference or whatever but I do have to observe that the choice of murder victims is well set up and you could theorise notions of dark desires, displacement, transference or schizophrenia in these choices. To be more transparent about what I'm saying, I'm suggesting that these are the kind of everyday choices that ordinary people might fantasise about after a bad experience with someone.Lastly, I do have to mention some plot holes...or just self-aware absurdities created for the film. Firstly, the first murder committed by the serial killer in their new guise...and what, exactly, was that device doing in a high school changing room? Secondly, how, exactly, was the serial killer able to continue on, after the 'resolution' to the body swap issue after they'd been......with regards to that second plot hole, that pretty much seems a bog standard scenario for those slasher films where the killer is like the ones in ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Halloween"".Oh, the score for the end credits reminded me of the theme from the film ""Jaws""."
27,I watched it a couple of days ago at the film festival and it was pretty good what the movie is about is a serial killer and a 17 year old girl switch bodies.
28,"After bringing us the genre blending slasher time loop comedy delight that was Happy Death Day and it's more sci-fi leaning sequel, Happy Death Day 2U, Christopher Landon is back with FREAKY.Keeping with his ongoing theme of taking two genres and slamming them together to great effect, FREAKY asks what would happen if The Hot Chick played out as a slasher film (who wouldn't want to watch that).FREAKY feels like a return to the straightforward simplistic fare of the first Happy Death Day for Landon, which works to great effect. After the fun (and quite gory!) stereotypical teen slasher film opening sequence we are introduced to Kathryn Newton's Millie Kessler, a student at Blissfield High who though some body swap magic gets put into the body of Vince Vaughn's aptly named serial killer, The Blissfield Butcher.This is where both Newton and Vaughn really start to have some fun, with Newton now a menacing serial killer in a teen body and Vaughn gleefully acting as a teen student in a comparatively massive and hilariously overpowered body.There isn't anything absolutely groundbreaking going on here but that's kind of what makes this film a whole lot of fun, It let's the focus stay on the great two performances and is honestly a perfect film to get away from 2020 for a while.FREAKY excels in every way you'd want it to, it fits perfectly into Landon's filmography and style with two great performances at the centre.Highly recommended if you enjoyed Landon's earlier Happy Death Day films or even if you're just a slasher fan, you won't be disappointed.FREAKY slashes into cinemas this Thursday the 12th November Australia wide! (Yes even Melbourne!!)Thanks to Universal Pictures Australia for providing the screener for review."
29,As soon as Vince Vaughn becomes a teenage girl everything becomes better
30,"Christopher Landon of Happy Death Day gives us the horror version of Freaky Friday in this clever genre mashup. Vince Vaughn in his best comedic role since Wedding Crashers plays a campy serial killer with a wooden mask and a bunch of weapons that likes to murder teens in increasingly goretastic ways. The movie is fun but and I mean this in the best way it feels like a Disney horror flick. It has a big heart and a bunch of comedy that mostly hits. Katherine Newton is okay in the lead. She's engaging when she's Millie but as the killer she's just not believable. That being said the film is filled with colorful characters, stylish cinematography and a sense of fun. It never quite reaches the potential it promises but it's a bloody good time nonetheless.****/5
Eric: 4.5/5"
31,This movie had great humour all the way through. Well done with the casting and script!
32,"This movie isn't perfect but damn sure is a fun watch. Went with a group of friends we all enjoyed it. The kills were intense, the script was clever and funny even if at times simple. I loved the little homages to other horror films. Definitely nice film especially for this Friday the 13th!"
33,"""Freaky"" is an amazing dark comedy horror flick with a lot of references of classic horror movies of the slasher subgenre. This film is as ""Freaky Friday"" and ""The Hot Chick"" in a horror story. The script is a satire of the slasher subgenre, a lot of funny clichés, cool performances, a colorful cinematography, great direction and good gory scenes. A modern classic."
34,"This is mindless slasher fun. Was funny, some good deaths & an awesome red jacket. Don't take this serious, its a bit ridiculous but a fun way to escape for an hour & a half."
35,So creepy and funny at the same time! Loved this movie the cast did a great job!
36,"""Reel Tunez... The Radio Show All About the Movies"" Movie Review (11/17/20): ""Freaky""Wow!! LOTS of laughs with the horror/comedy! Just think of Freaky Friday, and replace mother daughter with nerd school girl and a killer. Vince Vaughn is hilarious acting as the nerdy girl in the body of the killer (and EVERY time he ran, he ""CUT"" me up (pun.. but yes.. LAUGH!)... while Kathryn Newton is great as the killer in the school girl body! The cast was great and so was the acting in this Christopher Landon directed film (and if that last name sounds familiar, his ""Pa"" was Charles Ingalls on Little House on the Prairie (Michael Landon)! Also in the film was actor Alan Ruck who we all loved as Cameron from Ferris Bueller's Day Off.. but who did a great job playing the VERY unlikable smarmy shop teacher Mr. Bernardi.This is a great horror movie.. yet a great comedy, and Landon really did an awesome job mixing the two! I won't give any details to spoil it, but lets just say that at times we almost cheer the killer on!I'd rank this very high with a 7.3, and that a high score on my ratings! It's GREAT to see a movie during these times (during COVID) that is actually a great flick to catch in the theater!!Go so ""Freaky"".. and have fun being scared!"
37,"Freaky tells the story of a teenage girl who wakes up one morning to find her consciousness stuck inside the body of the man who tried to murder her the night before. She quickly realizes that this must mean that the killer's consciousness is in her body, and she spends the rest of the film trying to mitigate consequences and get her body back.On paper, this is a firecracker of an idea. It's simple, straightforward, but also creative and promising. It is Freaky Friday meets Friday the 13th, a fun but spooky body-swapping teen slasher film. And surely, when the credits roll, Freaky's finest accomplishment is that it does good service to this idea. Writers Christopher Landon and Michael Kennedy spend their 101 minutes with the concept leaving hardly any conceptual stone unturned, managing to wring humour, tension and heart from the story in all of the right ways, while always keeping good pace and never forgetting what kind of movie it is: a fun one.The trouble with Freaky, however, is that it's greatest strength is also it's weakness. In servicing it's central idea, this Freaky Friday the 13th, the film does manage to hit the right notes. But what notes are those? Well, they are the notes, the themes, the plot devices, the characters and the twists laid out by the film's inspirations. That is to say, in trying to be Freaky Friday and in trying to be Friday the 13th, Freaky more or less is those movies. It does an admirable job at mashing the two, but at the end of the day, it is never more than the sum of its parts. And so, as a viewer, you spend only so much of Freaky enjoying the idea before you realize that you have seen this movie before. You know where it goes. You know how it ends. The movie shies away from subverting expectations in any way, obviously frightened that it will veer to far from it's predecessors, but then it becomes it's predecessors.This quality becomes even more egregious as the film the progresses. Near the end of the film, when the clock is ticking and the stakes are high, the viewer never feels any real sense of threat because they have seen a slasher before. The killer always escapes their confines. The killer always appears to have the upper hand. The final girl always comes out on top. And then there are body-swapping movies. The protagonist always gets her body back. The protagonist always learns a heartfelt lesson. Things always workout. And Freaky never grows self-aware here, as it attempts to throw twists and turns into the final few minutes that cause the audience's eyes to glaze over. By this point, they has seen the film spend over an hour setting itself into a specific mold. They know that it's not going to veer from that, and it doesn't.And so, while I would recommend seeing Freaky with some friends, popping some popcorn, and enjoying the hijinks, never expect to be on the edge of your seat with Freaky. Enjoy it for what it is, and try to forget what it isn't."
38,"I saw a trailer for this last week & thought it looked like good fun for a Sunday & it delivered + more! Both Vince & Kathryn play both sides of their roles incredibly well. Vince when he's Millie delivers some of the best laughs of this film, just through movements & facial expressions more than words. Misha who plays Josh & Celeste who plays Nyla were perfectly cast for this film, adding so many well timed laughs into this. The horror side of it, like a lot of horrors, is pretty predictable but the visual side of it is really good, there's one at the start that's brilliant to watch if you're not squeamish & another later in the film that are top notch! The Kessler family aren't pushed completely to the side, there's a nice scene in the change rooms with the mother & you can tell the sister is protective. The love interest with Booker (Uriah) is a nice add to the story & delivered some great scenes, especially one in the car with Vince when he's Millie! If you want something to watch, that's not overly serious & a bit of horror fun, I think you'll really like this!"
39,I absolutely love this movie! It is hilarious but with a side of blood and gore to it! This movie is a great horror comedy and has a great twist to it! The movie is a bit violent when it comes to the kills for example the first kill of the movie is when one teenager has a glass bottle shoved down his throat or when The Butcher saws Millie's teacher in half. Great movie! I give it a 10/10!
40,"I saw ""Freaky"", starring Vince Vaughn-Hacksaw Ridge, The Lost World:Jurassic Park; Kathryn Newton-Big Little Lies_tv, Blockers; Uriah Shelton-Girl Meets World_tv, The Glades_tv and Alan Ruck-Speed, Ferris Bueller's Day Off.
This is a horror/comedy based on the 1972 Freaky Friday book written by Mary Rodgers-and also the Disney movies-and the movie is written & directed by Christopher Landon, who also did the Happy Death Day movies, Paranormal Activity:The Marked Ones and The Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse. Vince plays a serial killer in the vein of Jason-he has a similar hockey style mask-that is terrorizing a town. Kathryn is a shy high school girl-no boyfriend, she dresses drably, doesn't comb her hair, but you can tell that she could be a popular girl if she worked at it-that is the latest target for Vince. In his latest kill_a_thon, Vince finds a knife that just happens to be cursed and he uses it on Kathryn. But, instead of killing her, it swaps their bodies, with him in her body and vice versa-that's where most of the comedy comes from. Through diligent research-and the help of a couple of her friends-Kathryn discovers that there is a time limit on when they can switch back or it becomes permanent. Uriah plays the boy that Kathryn likes-but she doesn't think he knows she exists-and Alan plays one of her teachers. It's not all fun and games though, the violence is pretty graphic-there is one scene in particular that shows her cutting a person in half with a table saw.
It's rated ""R"" for strong bloody violence, sexual content-no nudity-and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 41 minutes. If you like these types of movies-horror/comedy-you should enjoy it. I did and I would buy it on Blu_Ray."
41,I watched it at the film festival and it was all about a body swap
42,"From start to end, comedy!! Once the ""mystery"" starts it's all up hill from there! Very good laughs and some very gory scenes, but perfectly done lol"
43,This movie is a great time and the opening scene was such a good hook. Go see this!
44,"Kathryn & Vince hardly share any screen time together, and manage to pull off some incredible performances. I honestly forgot at some points that they were switched (actually believed Kathryn was a homicidal maniac & Vince was a very confused girl in a man's body).The pacing was good, lots of good jokes, hard kills and bloody fun.
What more can you ask of a movie?"
45,Vince Vaughn is not only a great serial killer but an even better teenage girl. The move was surprising with twists and turns. All of the characters did a great job acting. This was a great movie
46,"This film is great. If you're a horror fan you won't miss the homage to Halloween, Friday the 13th & Scream. The comedy is perfect mixed well with the horror and gore. Vince Vaughn is hilarious and the film is just fun from beginning to end. A total must watch movie."
47,"This movie made the greatest decision in being rated R. Lots of gory kills that just make it better, the acting is great from the two leads, and the supporting cast does a great job as well."
48,"For those that don't know the lingo, ""body swap"" means exactly that - one person's consciousness is transferred into another person's body and often vice versa. You know, the Jack Black and Rock version of Jumanji, and Freaky Friday ( I can only remember the Jodie Foster one but there is at least one other).
Plenty of good reviews here.
I can only add that it draws inspiration from Mean Girls, Friday the 13th, and Freaky Friday, and it is original because of the inclusion that slasher/horror genre.
It's as much a genre swap as a body swap!
Blumhouse strikes again."
49,"What kind of ""this body is not mine"" but without Rob Schneider and version of evil is this?
A film that masterfully combines comedy and suspense, it is not horror.
It is about a murderer called the butcher who in an attack takes an ancient knife and when attacking a girl unleashes a curse by changing bodies with him.
Quality.
Entertaining
Performances at the level.
Vince Vaughn acts spectacular as a teenage girl.
The characters of the girl's friends and boyfriend steal the screen.
Has all the essence of this body is not mine.
The comedy is organic.
The deaths are fine, even some dismemberments look great on screen, excess blood.
Predictable ending but it entertains you.
If you like the films of the BH production company, you will like this film."
