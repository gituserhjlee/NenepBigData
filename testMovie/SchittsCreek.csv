0,"I have yet to make it through an episode without laughing out loud and I'm already on Season 3 after finding this show two days ago. This is one of the best shows that I have ever stumbled upon. The characters are perfectly cast and each is relatable in their own way. I cannot say enough good things about this show. Plus, Stevie and David are officially my favorite TV duo of all time.Watch this show!!"
1,"Apparently not for everyone, but I can not get enough of it.
I HATED the ads on Netflix, HATED!, but somehow I finally got around to watching an episode....instantly my new favourite show.Cast is stellar, offbeat quirky humour is my jam. Main cast and side characters fit so well together, people you don't need a laugh track to tell you when something is funny.The shared mannerisms between the Rose family are one of my favourite things about this show, you could almost believe they grew up around each other.
Consistent story line, sweet heartfelt moments, genuinely funny at times, horribly cringey at others.As someone who has never reviewed anything before, (was it hard to tell?), I felt compelled to share my love for this show."
2,"I had a hard time getting into it with the first couple episodes, but after learning about the characters it really gets good. I really enjoy it a lot. It's just a fun show to binge!! And Dan Levy (David)makes the show!!!"
3,"""Schitt's Creek"" is about love and humanity, told in an absolutely hilarious way. The show gets honest laughs and the characters become like family. It is simply one of the best comedies of all time. It is certainly THE most important comedy to have prominent LGBT characters (sorry ""Will and Grace""). A must see. Creator/star Daniel Levy is a comedic wunderkind. With the show ending with its 6th season, I can't wait to see what he does next."
4,"A killer cast mixing vets with fresh faces, Schitt's Creek is a great new cable comedy (although it airs on network TV in Canada.) The cinematography and production design remind me of Shameless; the sharp writing and unique characters remind me of Silicon Valley. The slow and steady pace reminds me of the Christopher Guest movies that O'Hara and Levy were in. It's a rich pedigree indeed. And it doesn't disappoint. I was puzzled why so many people didn't like it initially, but I think I get it: with a title like that, some people must have been expecting something juvenile, and laugh-a-minute. Schitt's Creek is much much better than that.The confidence on the part of the filmmakers is evidenced by the lack of a laugh track, and further, the musical score is used sparingly. It can be hilariously funny, but what really hooks me is that it has a heart and a sweetness that other shows might be afraid to show. There are no characters in the show that are unlikeable. It favors character development over easy laughs, and it may take a while for people to catch on to it, but to me this is a sweet slow buzz, and I am addicted.Can't wait for more."
5,"I don't know why so many negative reviews have been written about this show. Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara are classics and it's great to see them back working together. Eugene's son is hilarious and I find their over the top impressions of each of their characters to be spot on. The actress playing the daughter in particular is demonstrating how I see the attitude and behaviour of a lot of the young people today- shallow, vacant and self absorbed. I find this show to be clever yet silly at the same time. Read between the lines and stop expecting this to be like every other tired sitcom out there. I find this show to be very refreshing and I look forward to seeing more episodes. I have never taken the time to do a review before on IMDb but because of the negative comments I felt I had to say something as I hope people will open their minds and give it a chance."
6,"I'm one of the many who, I admit, expected absolutely nothing from a show called Schitt's Creek, so never bothered to even have a look in. Well, I'm here to say I have never been more wrong about a television program!Absolutely love this, and I feel sorry for those who don't get the abundant clever-but-subtle humour that has obviously gone straight over their heads and caused them to leave bitter, whining, negative reviews. Too bad for them, but it's their loss.Schitt's Creek grew on me episode by episode, so much so that I binge-watched the first 4 seasons on Netflix over a weekend! Once in, I couldn't leave! It just gets better and better and I didn't want it to end. I am now watching series 5 and will be awaiting the sadly final series come January 2020 (I hope).I read too many negative reviews from people whining about CBC nepotism and the fact that Dan Levy got a job on this show through his father, so please take note: Dan Levy is the creator of Schitt's Creek, so it could be said he gave his father this job. Together they put this show together, and by bothering to read the credits it's clear that Dan wrote and directed (I think) many of the episodes.On top of that, he plays David brilliantly! His sweetness, fashion obsession, insecurity, need for approval and wit are so cleverly played. People complaining about Dan Levy and his facial expressions: Hello! Those are part of his brilliant performance as David. All the characters express so much with just a glance, an eyebrow twitch or the sardonic curl of a lip -- words aren't even necessary with actors this accomplished! Daniel Levy: you have brought joy to my heart with your writing and portrayal of David Rose!Alexis Rose is annoying, dreadfully so at first. But she learns, she evolves, she grows as time passes. As does David. They are very believable as brother and sister, even sometimes displaying similar mannerisms and expressions. Such clever writing, acting and directing.I have laughed out loud watching Schitt's Creek. I have felt delighted, annoyed, surprised, cringey, charmed and deeply touched. Season 4 episodes Open Mic and The Olive Branch brought tears to my eyes. ""That"" scene in Olive Branch I have rewatched about a dozen times and will watch again and again. (Avoiding spoilers here so not saying more than that.)David Rose. I just want to put my arms around him, give him a big hug, tell him he's beautiful and good and right and that everything will be okay.Love, love, love Schitt's Creek. Love the humour, the satire, the subtle jokes and the big, fat broad ones, and most of all I love the love. It's a beauty!"
7,"This show is so enjoyable to watch. The acting is something else and really gives the show some spunk. All the characters in the town are so weird and unique in their own way. It is amazing seeing a wealthy family blend with the people of Schitt's Creek. The facial expressions and voices of the entire rose family makes me laugh every time. I also absolutely love the sarcasm from Stevie, as she continues to encourage the stuck up attitude of the entire Rose family. Very good show for laughing and casual viewing!"
8,Amazingly good series--LOVE all the actors in it!! but Eugene & Daniel Levy steal the series...with their humor & eyebrows...greatest series I've seen in a LONG while!! THE BEST SERIES ON TV!!
9,"I love this show. I was given the heads up by the UK tv/radio listings magazine Radio Times, of all things. Fortunately, Netflix was gifted to us and we thought we'd give it a try. Well, once my other half and I started watching, we couldn't stop. We've watched 4 seasons in about 3 weeks or so. This should give some idea of how good this show is. The draw was the wonderful Eugene Levy but the other cast members are absolutely perfect, especially Dan Levy and his fabulous character David. I just love the way some of the cast appear to be desperate to giggle at some points, indicating to me they are having a ball. Great writing and performances. Must also mention Catherine O'Hara and the clothes and wigs! I hope Netflix show season 5 soon. Withdrawal symptoms have set in already!

10,"With a title like ""Schitt's Creek"" you'd think that this show would be full of nothing but crass jokes. That couldn't be further from the truth. It's full of heart, and somehow this snobby, annoying rich family grows on you more and more with each episode.
By the end of Season 4 I had tears dripping down my face because of how these characters have found love through immense personal growth. My favs are David and Moira, but even though I found Alexis mostly annoying, I grew to love even her in the end.I'm so glad I had this recommended to me by friends who insisted I watch it, because I never watch these types of sitcoms otherwise.Thank you Dan Levy for coming up with this concept! I listened to him talk about the development of this show through a podcast and I have to say, I hope he writes more shows in the future."
11,I was the most sceptical person going into the show but when the season progressed the characters got a great depth despite the quirky setup. The site is suprisingly Emotional that makes the characters much more relatable considering the situation they are in.
12,"I think this show is refreshing and smart. It's a bit quirky so I can see it not being to everyone's comedic taste but I just love it. Way to go Dan and Eugene for capturing the ridiculousness of ""rich people"" reality TV when creating this sitcom. Dan Levy's character is amazing and Catherine O'Hara is great - love seeing her again! Excellent characters, good pacing and great writing. It's nice to see a hip comedy on CBC that caters to a wide age-range of viewers. I'm definitely looking forward to watching how the characters evolve and crossing my fingers that the story remains strong and that the show has another season."
13,"I see so much negativity about this show so felt the need to login and write a review.This show is funny. It's dry/sarcastic type humour, they may be confused about the show actually being funny since there is no laugh track.Is it the funniest show I have ever watched? No. But it is quite funny, the main characters are fairly likable, and for once on a new series the actors can actually act.It's not a show everyone will find amusing, but it has it's moments, and is worth watching - so far."
14,We just randomly started watching this show a week or so ago and finished it today. Such an underrated and hilarious show! Give it a shot and you'll fall in love with it. So well written.
15,"Excellent performances, I laughed out loud, worth a watch. Uh... OK I see that I must submit ten lines of text to make this review count. That's insane. Well, as a Canadian-US dual citizen, I love both countries and opt to promote the exceptional cultural contributions of both. This is the best Canadian content I've seen in a damn long time, and I'd like to make note of it. I'm normally a person of few words so I hope this pleases the IMDb review gods.oh Christ! It's still too short! Alright...Bobloblaw, Bobloblaw, Bob Loblaw, Bob Loblaw. I need two more lines. It's a good show. Can I not just say that in one line? I'm a very proud Canadian to be wasting this much GD time on a review. I see how many garbage shows survive and how many great ones fail. Check this one out."
16,"This show has it all: hilarious, lovable characters, amazing relationships, emotional moments galore and brilliant writing. I enjoyed season 1, loved season 2, thought season 3 was perfect and the rest of the seasons were all lovable and amazing. One of the best comedies of all time!"
17,"I had heard about this show somewhere but since we are not cable subscribers never got to see it. It is now on broadcast TV. My Wife started watching first and I got more more interested after catching a little bit here and there. Roland and Moira almost made me leave, but David, Stevie, Alexis, and Johnny made me stay. We started watching the episodes that were later in the series first and they have now cycled back to the beginning. Without a doubt the Moira character got way more annoying, the way she is in the first two episodes is much more bearable. Not a fan of the ending. I wanted something better for Alexis. Great show and great cast."
18,"Let's face it fellow Canucks, with the exception of a handful, most home-grown sitcoms have failed miserably. Corner Gas is probably the last one that was worth writing home about. And before that... Probably Kids in the Hall and SCTV. And when you consider that our hard- earned tax dollars have gone into the CBC trash right along with all those failed attempts, it's downright infuriating.Add the loss of HNIC to their declining profitability, and CBC was pretty much up ""Schitt's Creek"". And it's a good thing they are...Levy and O'Hara, in the new CBC sitcom ""Schitt's Creek"", almost make up for the decades of disappointment. And Levy's real- life son (who plays the on-screen son) is hysterical. He came out of literally nowhere. Nothing significant in his repertoire - ever. And yet he is nailing this character! Love him. Thank goodness, otherwise we could never willing excuse the outrageous nepotism. Happy to see the classic duo together again. This witty, dry, sarcastic comedy fits perfectly in both Levy and O'Hara's wheelhouse. I don't see how it could miss. I can't even begin to guess the tax dollars this one is gonna cost us. But it's almost worth it.Holy Schitt, CBC... It's about time. Way to go!"
19,I hesitated watching this show because of the dumb name but I am so glad I finally did. Such hilarious characters who seem far fetched but are very relatable. This show has so much humor and heart that one second I'm cracking up and the next I get a lump in my throat. So well written and delightful to watch. I hope it goes on for more seasons it's truly a gem.
20,"This show is hilarious - the humour is both adult and a little bit cruel - and the cast is spot on - watching the 2 old pros O'Hara and Levi working together again is such a pleasure. The writing is excellent; jokes are not telegraphed,and the laughs come as much from the delivery as from the lines themselves. The device that drives the plot is the fact that the Rose family has come down in the world with a tremendous thud and now they have to live like ordinary schmucks. This works the best when attention turns to the two young adult children in the Rose family - it- they are truly clueless and very funny to watch. To sum up, Schitt's creek features great writing and great comedy - give it a look!"
21,"I love how people dump on a series based on the first episode or two and The Canadian = crap stereotype is unfair and tiresome. This show is quickly developing its characters and by the third episode has me intrigued. If you are looking for Two and a Half Men or the like, don't waste your time. If you are a fan of the Christopher Guest movies, or Arrested Development, you will be a fan. Levy Sr. and O'Hara are at their best, and the rest of the cast which includes comedy vet Chris Elliot have delivered very promising subplots so far. It has been my first look at Daniel Levy, Annie Murphy and Emily Hampshire and all three have brought immediate depth to their characters. Subtle, ironic humour, great directing, and an excellent cast have me hooked. We need more TV like this, so give it a chance!"
22,"I must admit to really struggling to get into this show in the beginning. After Season 1, I couldn't work out why the reviews were so good, I just wasn't finding it that funny, and wasn't keen on the characters, but I knew I had to keep watching. I think the mistake I made was expecting it to be as laugh out loud as something like Modern Family for example. With Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy who have made me laugh so much with things like Best In Show and a Mighty Wind I was expecting the same thing. But then it just clicked, subtle jokes, characters that become more and more lovable each episode, and really touching moments which have made me shed a tear on more than one occasion. By season five I was feeling sad that there was only going to be one more season after this. This is so well written, and the first time I've seen Dan Levy in anything, and he is just brilliant. If you're thinking of switching off, don't, keep going!"
23,"The first season of this show is funny and worth watching, which is pulled off without the show taking itself too seriously. In the following seasons, they somehow find a way to continually add character depth without ever violating the jovial feel of the original episodes. And the way they wrapped things up was perfect. The last few episodes were like a 50-cal rainbow gun, shooting all the feels in rapid fire. If you start this show, you're likely to get sucked in and enjoy yourself; continue on to the end and you're likely fall in love with the quirky inhabitants of Schitt's Creek."
24,TV needs more people like Daniel Levy! The whole cast is amazing and I can't stop watching it.
25,"Reading some of the negative reviews above made me question whether i was watching the same show as them. I found the show one of the better comedy productions Canadian television has put out in a LONG time. Is it everyone's cup of tea? Obviously not! Granted the premise is a bit silly and it IS over the top, but that's what made some of SCTV's skits and characters so endearing. And the writing is sharp and witty (although there are some misses here and there). Levi and O'Hara are in fine form, and the actors playing the children (one is Levi's son) play well off the parents. Add in some pretty quirky locals, and you have the makings of a pretty funny sit-com. If you were a fan of the old SCTV, chances are you'll enjoy this outing tremendously!!"
26,I have never laughed out loud more during a show. I just love it.
27,"My coworker told me about this show, so I figured I would give it a shot. My husband and I watched the first episode, and then couldn't stop. We ended up watching seasons 1 and 2, in about a week, and now we are rationing season 3, so we don't run out them too quickly as there is only one full season remaining before they start again in January.You know when you watch a show, and you generally only like one or two characters? I love all of the characters!! They all play their parts so well, Stevie, Alexis, Johnny, Moira, and David, I love Chris Elliot, and his role as the Mayor is perfect for him! His wife Jocelyn is spot-on, everyone is! It is like the roles were made specifically for the actors.It is very funny, but also touching. We laugh a lot, out loud, which isn't something I often do when watching TV. I also teared up a few times now, and so did my husband. I wish there were more seasons we could binge on...This show is fabulous!!"
28,"I'm gonna miss this show so much , it was everything a tv show should be . I honestly hope Daniel levy creates & acts more because he is truly amazing at what he does (as does the whole cast) I live in Toronto Ontario Canada where most of the cast is from & going to take a drive to see the rose bud motel some day & then start watching the series all over again . Canada 🇨🇦 proud 👍"
29,"I have watched this en-loop for a very long time. Tubas now makes me smile. It gets smarter and funnier every single time. Haven't seen season 6 but I live and breathe for season 5! I am a better person and like life again, and people sometimes, because of this show. Do NOT tell anyone that knows me though."
30,"This is really a Levy family affair. The Comedy is dry and wet depending upon the circumstances. Eugene's son and daughter are both in the cast, but only the son plays his son. His daughter plays a role outside the family. Most of this CBC production cast is Canadian with the American exception of Roland. Levy family have credits for writing and producing too.The strength of this series is definitely the writing. The scripts have some outstanding dramatic moments and dialog between characters that make a lot of other shows pale in comparison. That actually over-rides the annoying over the top characters in the series because it brings them back to being real. Credit Eugene and Dan Levy, a father and son team with this dialog. Granted the cast including them have talent, but without the scripts great dialogue, that talent would come up short.Johnny Rose (Eugene) plays the father who is very careful and yet careless at the same time. The reason this works so well is that this series is mostly set in a small town. This bankrupt big city family moves here in desperation as kind of a last stop after a huge set back in New York City. They move into a motel as it represents their last resort. Moria (Catherine O'Hara) is an extremely annoying mother and former soap actress who is overtaken with herself and her family of wigs. She is sort of in need of a new job for her ego sake. At the same time she is so concerned with the family and adjusting downward from the mansion life style and big city.Speaking of self absorbed, daughter Alexis Rose (Annie Murphy) has not only that in common with her mother, but she is also Intelligent and Flighty too. This plays off Moira well as there are times Alexis can be annoying but more often than not she is annoyed by the rest of the family. She also seems to find men to easily and is poor at picking the right one, much less getting the right one and then losing them at least twice.As annoying as Alexis is, the person she is closest too and annoys the most is David Rose (Dan Levy), the brother whose the exact opposite of his father. David talks faster than anyone else, is obsessed and paranoid all at the same time, and at times is more like Alexis closest sister rather than brother. He has all the most outrageous wardrobe and yet has better tastes in clothes than Alexis though some of his prowess is gotten from his mom Moira who besides her wig has some outrageous tastes of her own. David is out there in more ways than one, as he sort of shares Alexis tastes for men which gives them the closest bond and brother and sister can have.When they move into Schitt's Creek, the motel worker is Stevie Budd (Emily Hampshire). She is very underplayed early on in this series but she often becomes the stable person who all the family and cast play off. While you would not think so at the start, by the end of this show I love Stevie the most.
While she is strong and independent, she is the only one who can say and do the right things at the right times. Without Stevie, this show just would not work as well.Then we have Roland Schitt (Chris Elliott), the Mayor of Schitt's Creek who more often than not is off drinking beer and doing some grass early on. He always has outrageously wrong things to say and do. Roland goes off on tangents that lead into disaster which his wife Jocelyn (Jennifer Robertson) tolerates though at times this wears thin on her.As the series goes along Twyla Sands (Sarah Levy), the cafe waitress gets more and more involved in the story. The slow development of her character is really put on the back burner until the middle of the series. All of a sudden you realize she can act, and her role becomes more defined as an anchor for the family.A couple of seasons or so in, David Rose finally meets Patrick Brewer (Noah Reed) who becomes the apple of his eye and helps David find someone stable he decides to bring into the family. David makes some mistakes along the way with his new business partner but then thanks to Stevie realizes who Patrick is to become in his life.While past failures pretty much overwhelm the family early on, the small town and the folks in it help them find strength and opportunity to come back. There are messages here throughout the series about relationships and how fragile they can become while when the strength develops how the most unlikely of people can team up and accomplish the most unlikely of goals. While the ultimate event to top off this series, the wedding of David and Patrick is accomplished, there is so much more going on around it that the series makes everything seem like positive things can truly result from chaos.This show proves that a tuba theme fits the goings on just fine., and going up Schitt's Creek isn't as bad as it sounds. Even having the name Schitt can be better than it sounds. They even manage to cross the lines of abnormal versus normal without being offensive and have fun doing so."
31,"""So it's about how you live your life. You know, doing what makes you smile. And being here, getting to hear your stories over the past few years, even the scary ones... that makes me smile.""Where was this show all my life?Sometimes while watching something so pure, you feel so good that you don't want it ever to end and you become so much a part of their journey that you're no longer just a fan watching the show, you're in it as a character. You feel what they feel, you get sad when they're sad, you cry with them, you smile with then and you love with them.Schitt's Creek is everything good and pure in this world. Such a fun ride with lots of laughs and emotions with a brilliant cast and exceptional writing. So overwhelmingly heartful and a show that celebrates love.
Unlike most of the sitcoms nowadays Schitt's Creek sticks to a certain plot. A rich family of four who looses all of their wealth and finds themselves in a place where they never envisioned themselves to be. Two joined bedrooms in an old, rusty motel in a sad old town. However, the best thing about this show is how they all grow and evolve and becomes better versions of themselves and finds the family which was missing within themselves.The level of character development in Schitt's Creek is admirable. Each and every character grows and develops in such an incredible way, subtle and maintained enough to keep a perfect pace throughout each season.Eugene Levy as Johnny Rose plays the father of the before mentioned disorganised family. He is the pillar that holds them together, he sacrifices his needs to keep his kids and wife happy. He is a father that you'd want as your own. Johnny's not always the funniest in the room but his compassion towards his family and friends is one of the purest things you'll ever see in a tv show.Catherine O'Hara as Moira Rose is another superbly portrayed character. From a stone-cold heartless washed up tv actress to a somewhat loving parent and a friend. Her style, poise, elegance on screen is really something and she makes it look so effortless.Annie Murphy plays Alexis Rose, who also does such a great job playing a challenging character like this one. It was such a journey throughout the show to see her character grow from a rich pampered spoiled kid to finally find love and valuing his friends and family.Daniel Levy as David Rose, well he is just flawless and the very best thing from Schitt's Creek. I sometimes rewind just to see his facial expressions and admire the level of acting. He is also a co-writer and director of the show alongside Eugene Levy. Also, David and Patrick are now one of my favourite tv couples. The two scenes where they sing to each other and of course the wedding scene is so darn perfect. :')But among all of the characters, Stevie might be the most relatable and down to earth. Also, Roland, Jocelyn, Twyla, Ted and even Bob.. god I love all of them! Reminds me of The Office.This show takes me back to the good old days when I used to watch only sitcoms all day without a worry in the world.
Sad that I finished it so quickly but once a wise man said, ""Don't be sad that it's over, open a bottle of Zhampagne and be happy that it happened."" and here's hoping that I'll find more shows like this one that makes my heart filled with joy because in the current environment our world is in, we need more shows like Schitt's Creek."
32,"An absolute stress buster . A cute loving light hearted comedy show . Initially I found some of its characters quite irritating , but than eventually , I literally fell in love with the show and it's characters . Will be watching it again."
33,"First off, this excellence in writing, casting, and performance stands without any criticism whatsoever....
But if we were all to dare to look to improve excellence(as is within our human condition)...I would have to say a ball has been dropped and rolled away into a far corner in the department of David Rose's hair. With David's personality being so specific with taste and such particular standards about what he considers acceptable, it seems that by now we would have viewed a very entertaining scene with him attempting to get all his hair needs met in the smallness of this place. Spas in other towns are mentioned, and in season 1 there is Moira and Jocelyn after a visit to Janine, but this subject is still very ripe for the picking if you ask me. I am a professional in the hair industry for 25+ years, and I am very curious as to how David Rose has not had any explainable verbiage given as to the continuing perfection of his hair. What gives?
On a different note, I cannot seem to get Tina Turner out of my head ever since season 4. You are all truly, Simply the Best."
34,"This show was such a delight! I enjoyed watching all the actors, they did such a great job and had so much chemistry with one another. It took me a few episodes to get into it but I'm glad I stuck with it. It just got better though the seasons."
35,"I'm really not sure where to begin but here goes.. I had this on my watch list on Netflix for a fair while as I've always been a huge fan of Eugene Levy, so for me it was a must watch. I dont think a single episode had me lose interest or not laugh my head off! This really is relatable emotional roller coaster with the best cast you could possibly imagine. I would love to see more things to come created by the amazing Daniel Levy! I thought it was fantastic how much they looked alike when i was a few episodes in only to discover there are 3 members of the cast from the Levy family so it made sense. I'm not going to through any spoilers in but if you want to watch something you cannot put down, which will make you both laugh and cry, then Schitt's creek is one hell of a watch, I also never really rate anything 10/10 but this is everything!"
36,"I love this show! Not many shows catch my interest these days, but this one is top notch hilarious!"
37,"Its a joy to watch a show that youve heard of before but never expected much from it so didnt end up watching it...and then kick yourself for not watching it sooner. The cast gels perfectly and you can tell they really enjoy working together. Writing is supberb, very funny at time and out of nowhere its very deep and heartfelt."
38,"I'm a sucker for comedy, since laughing is one of the perks of life. So I decided to check this show out - new series, I didn't get my hopes up too high. The first episode had me more puzzled than smiling. With the second episode I started to get it, and I laughed out loud at tiny bits of detail that were so hilarious.The humor is crispy and dry, clever and understated. I was thinking Party Down and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, not because these shows are similar, just the opposite, they stand apart from the rest. Originality is a fine thing you sometimes have to get to know before you embrace it.The father and son team - creators, actors, characters - are funny just flexing their massive eyebrows. But they are not everything; the whole weird idea and well chosen cast are wonderfully put together. I like this one, I hope it will grow, it sure as hell has potential:-)"
39,"The first season didn't have its ""voice"" yet, then halfway through season two I couldn't stop laughing! Season 3 is even better! Give it a shot it's a perfect Netflix binge worthy show"
40,"People writing the negative reviews need to expand their ideas of funny beyond ""friends"" or other standard network fare. Besides an outstanding ensemble cast, the over the top camp of the show makes it refreshing and funny as hell. The cast members success in committing to their characters and executing them believably shows the caliber of artists they are. Performing in roles this exaggerated and creating a real individual instead of just a caricature is, in my opinion, entertainment! I keep checking for new episodes and in the mean time I watch past episodes over again . This is truly a fun and entertaining show."
41,"I heard about this little gem via a few facebook friends who had recently binge-watched it on-demand. Tardy to the party I started season 1 about 2 weeks ago and am almost through season 4. I love this show.It's not a traditional canned humor show. It's a character study that requires investment. Every character on the show has layers and depth only revealed a after you've ""known"" them for a while. The plots aren't exaggeraged but feel comedic, the dialogue whimsical yet realistic.Give it a full season before you decide. I was on the fence for a long time but now really care about all of the characters like the family they are becoming."
42,"The comparison to Arrested Development is inevitable, but Schitt's Creek is different in that it has character growth which, for me, is as much an important driver of these ""from riches to rags"" stories and the humor in them.
A note about the cast: this is one of those shows where you can'timagine any of the characters played by anyone else. Catherine O'Hara and Dan Levy are unforgettable in their roles and ..someone give Eugene Levy's eyebrows an oscar already! :)The first 4 seasons are a treasure, but season 5 feels like the show is getting dangerously close to the bottom of the comedic barrel. It's evident the writers are manufacturing the same overused conflicts in every comedy: Johnny walking in on Stevie taking nudes, the whole ""your boyfriend kissed my boyfriend"" bit between Alexis and David, etc.
Also, as the show goes on, you start wondering whether the town was as rundown and off the beaten track and it was orginally suggested: in how many dingy towns does a shop selling upscale body lotions, lipbalm, candles and luxury cheese stay profitable???All that said, watching the Roses out of their element, and how they try in their own clueless, haughty, self-absorbed way to start over, gets one to care a lot about these characters, what happens to them, the lessons they learn and the victories they manage to score: they may not be 100% relatable, but they are lovable!"
43,"Not a fake review.I rarely write reviews, but was reading the reviews for Schitt's Creek and got tired of all the unnecessary hate. This is a solid show and certainly doesn't deserve the horrible 1 star reviews it is receiving. If you don't like this show it is because you don't get it. It is much deeper than it appears.Let's start with the name 'Schitt's Creek'. Already you know the show is going to be a bit on the goofy doofy side with a name like that. However, that is not all it is. Sarcasm, wit, talent, and depth permeate this show by way of refreshing jokes and characters.Have we seen a hundred Roland Schitts before? Yes, but this time he is played by Chris Elliot which makes all the difference. Far smarter than he looks, Chris Elliot's 'Roland' is a gem of a character especially when paired with his adorable wife Jocelyn Schitt played by Jennifer Robertson. Roland and Jocelyn Schitt have real heart. These two nail the small town couple who not only love each other, but love their town as well. (Speaking of love, pay attention because this show's main theme is love if you take the time to notice.)Stevie Budd. Ah, Stevie. Played by Emily Hampshire, Stevie is your typical ""over it"" girl. She has seen it all, heard it all and is rather unimpressed with it all. Her personality is deeply dry, sarcastic, and sometimes dark. She is also very capable and is often the voice of wisdom and reason. With all that said, she is tough, but isn't callous. She is caring, giving, and is a wonderful friend. We also get to see peeks of her weak side, the soft center protected by the hard exterior.Note: While Stevie is a great character, she plays the best off David. I hope the show brings their closeness back as she seems to have been put on a shelf after the Stevie/David hookup thing.Now, onto the Roses.
Let's start with Johnny Rose played by Eugene Levy. Alright, Levy is comedic gold. Always has been, always will be. Does he serve up the level of talent that we have all grown accustomed to in THIS show? Yes! Yes, he does, however he does so with restraint. What I mean is, there is not supposed to be a main character of the Roses. Each Rose is meant to shine as brightly as the others without the show playing favorites. Now, each viewer will have a favorite (mine is David Rose), but the greatness here with Eugene Levy's character Johnny Rose is that he isn't pushed forward. If Johnny Rose was made to be even a little bit more in the spotlight, he would steal the show for sure! That, thankfully, is not the case here. We get to know each Rose equally.Johnny Rose is an interesting character. He has the hilarious without-a-clue Dad vibe that Eugene Levy is known for. Always very slightly confused, Johnny is completely loveable. He is by far the kindest and most down to Earth member of his family despite having been the most successful. His ""let's make this work"" attitude is a breath of fresh air amongst his ever complaining familial companions. He is a good man doing the best he can in a ""Schitty"" situation. Love him!Moira Rose. First, I think it is important to state the obvious fact that Catherine O'Hara, who plays Moira Rose, is just as talented as Eugene Levy. These two actors have played alongside each other a few times, and it is always wonderful. The on screen chemistry of Levy and O'Hara is fantastic. I have no doubts as to why O'Hara was chosen to play the wife of Johnny Rose.Now, with that said I must admit that Moira Rose is my least favorite of the Roses. Ugh, I hate saying that as I truly adore Catherine O'Hara, but because this is an honest review, I have the obligation to be 100% transparent.Moira Rose was a daytime television star turned rich socialite. She has a slightly inflated sense of self which makes her descent into reality even more entertaining to watch. She is the Rose that has the hardest time adjusting to their new lifestyle. She is a very loving, supportive wife as well. (I do love this aspect of Johnny and Moira as they could have easily been given a bad marriage, which many people have, to showoff the success of the marriage between Roland and Jocelyn Schitt.)Moira is intelligent, sexy, unpredictable, classy, and emotional. She is a very well rounded character with more heart than might be first guessed. She is a star of a character. My issue with Moira Rose is in the details, specifically her clothing and voice/mannerisms. Her clothing is unrealistic and way off character. It takes away from her class and sophistication. Her with collection is confusing. As for her voice/mannerisms, I find them to be off putting and distracting. I've never heard anyone speak the way Moira speaks, which makes her character feel false. If Moira's lines were delivered with normal conversational inflections, and her wardrobe was brought down a touch, she'd be a far more enjoyable character to watch.Now onto David Rose. I LOVE David. Played by Eugene Levy's son Daniel Levy, David Rose is one of my favorite characters of all time. I say this with a love for Hyacinth Bucket from Keeping Up Appearances, Lucy Ricardo from I Love Lucy, and Basil Fawlty from Fawlty Towers. David Rose is hilarious! He could have a show all to himself. He is bold and brave, sweet and shy. A truly dynamic character. His repulsion at so many things never fails to bring a laugh. He plays well off of every single character on the show, and is often the character that is most relatable despite his over the top wardrobe (which, in this case, does work very well) and his confusion with normal life. His facial expressions, mannerisms, voice, and delivery of his lines is spot on. He changes so much through out the seasons in a truly charming way. While there isn't really supposed to be a main character, if I had to pick one I would say it is David. Daniel Levy really has followed in his father's comedic footsteps. I hope to see more of Daniel Levy in the future.The youngest of the Roses, Alexis Rose, acted by Annie Murphy, is perfection. This character is, sadly, the most realistic of the Rose family. She is like so many ""Instagram girls"" out there. Selfish, immature, vapid, materialistic. Alexis is a disgusting human being...in the beginning. At first, I could not stand this character and wished she wasn't in the show. However, as the show progresses, she has changed so much while still retaining her personality. We have seen her fall in love. We have seen her heart break. We have seen her work hard to better herself despite her situation. Alexis is perhaps the most simple of the Roses, but is definitely worth paying attention to.All in all, this is a solid show with characters that are much deeper than they first appear to be. If you don't like this show, it is because you don't understand it."
44,"Perfect, just perfect... Hilarious from the opening scene to the last scene of the last episode.If we all lived in a community of tolerance, laughter and love like the folks of schitts creek the world would be fixed...This must be watched chronologically to truly feel the character development...Heatbroken they'll be no more new episodes..."
45,"If ever a TV show that demanded full-length feature treatment, it is this gem."
46,"I'm in love with this series. Daniel Levy's writing and comedic acting is the best I've ever seen.We all know the acting between Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hare Is like breathing 😊So seeing this new talent (to me) was so refreshing!Please keep doing what you do best. Making people laugh, then cry, then think.Love. Love. Love you all.Gabrielle"
47,My favorite comedic show hands down. Each character was relatable. Loved each development. I have never loved a show from beginning to end. I was sad when it ended but glad at the same time. The writers didn't stretch the story line. Began and Ended perfectly. This show is a MUST WATCH!
48,"I stumbled upon this incredibly amusing series one night and I am now watching it for the 3rd time in a row. I love it and the humor is just brilliant. I have never watched a show that has every character so perfectly cast. Wow! David, Patrick, Alexis ... my best! The relationship between David and Patrick is so beautiful and special... I do however love the scene in the motel with David and Jake when the family all intrude. Haha. That was so brilliantly done. I also love how at the end of season 6 it takes you on to learn about the characters and their feelings about acting in the show for 6 years. I also discovered ""Twyla, David and Johnny"" are family in reality. Just the best series ever!"
49,"Where to begin? The premise, a known one, works so well: spoiled people used to a fabulous existence thrown into a regular life. But what makes this show unique is that as a family, while they've lost everything, they unknowingly each use their past know-how to go forward. Its funny, witty and full of cringey moments too, but has real, raw story lines that give each character heart. 1000 loves for this!"
50,"At first, I wasn't so sure about this show and the characters. After a few episodes, and throughout each of the series, you can see the character development which is so charming for a cringeworthy show. Really enjoyable and easy to watch, and understandably has gone on for many seasons! Will miss it though."
51,"This is honestly one of the best shows I have ever watched. Watching this family stumble through learning to live without money, without people to do their bidding, and with each other is both hysterical and heartwarming. The town of Schitt's Creek is a world where homophobia, racism, and every other ism does not exist. While you would expect the townies to be the ones needing an education, it's the ex-wealthy family who have a lot to learn from the town. The acting is superb, even the smaller roles feel authentic and have their own spot on comedic timing. Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy have impeccable on screen chemistry, as in all of their other projects. You will laugh and cry all in a twenty minute episode."
52,"I kind of fiddled around on my phone through season one. I paid a little more attention in season two. By season 6, I was foregoing sleep and feeling like part of their family. It was so bad that I could hear my own thoughts in Moira's voice. I loved everything about it....the growth, the genuine wit, and the incredible acting that made it the most believable series that I have ever watched. I will probably watch it again. All of it."
53,"Quite possibly the best Canadian television ever. I can't stop watching again and again. The character of Moira is one of my favourite television characters, up there with George Costanza and Dwight Schrute.
Please watch this show."
54,"Brilliantly subtle humor that definitely goes over the heads of many, (see every negative review below) but is incredibly rewarding for fans of intelligent comedy.All the actors are great but it's the younger generation that are usually the funniest, with Dan Levy easily stealing every scene he's in.Worth checking out if you loved Arrested Development, Curb Your Enthusiasm, etc. If you need a laugh track to tell you when to laugh it's probably not the show for you."
55,This has to be the most underrated show. I was late to the party but the comedic performances and writing are an absolute joy. Every character hits the mark and whilst some have some questionable personality traits I loved them all. Will be sorry to see this end. Tell your friends to tune in and watch. They'll thank you for it.
56,"I started watching this a couple of weeks ago not knowing anything about it. It took a couple of episodes to reel me in but man it is amazing! The cast are hilarious and I absolutely love daniel levy in this. Every episode has had me laugh, a few even made me cry. Oh and I absolutely love the way Catherine O'hara pronounces ""baby"" in this! Cracks me up.Seriously, give this show a chance. It's great."
57,No joke! I freaking love this show! I literally laugh out loud every single episode! The character David is phenomenal!!!!
58,"I cannot understand how this can get 10/10 when all the characters are annoying and not funny, the jokes are lame, the acting is just plain annoying it's so painful to watch! Tried once, twice, three times- didn't change my opinion on it. Skipping to Season 3 in the hopes it will show justification for the show's following- NADA! Just as annoying and disappointing as the first episode. Don't even mention it in the same breath as Seinfeld, show some well-earned respect to the latter!"
59,"I love the characters....and the comedy is well written. I can't wait for the next episode. I love all the actors and the fact that 3 are Canadian (that I know of ) is a bonus. I can just imagine down the road...the possibilities are endless...the Mayor's wife is priceless.... I can't wait to watch a rich family's struggles while shacked up in a small, ugly, motel.... I'm not sure if the son plays a gay man, and I think they should make that more clear in the next episodes. I would like to see more of the town, and restaurant scenes....ultimately even though we have a dislike of snobs I find it hard to dislike the Roses. Their pathetic disposition and apparent snooty is likable."
60,"This is pure genius
I wanna move to Canada even more now."
61,"So, I don't usually watch the crap that CBC normally puts out there but they've finally made me laugh out loud. This show is brilliant, irreverent and funny. They've hit the nail right on the head with the Kardasian type family mixing it up with the locals in small town Canada or the US (wherever). The locals are brilliantly portrayed, from the town founders grandson to the supermarket manager to the school teacher. Lots of adult humour (bleeped out) but you get the picture. The rich family, again brilliant! Eugene Levy and Katherine O'Hara, brilliant and they really bring that smarmy Hollywood mentality alive. I can just see Paris Hilton losing her marbles after she winds up moving from a 30 room mansion to sharing a motel with her brother and getting dumped by her boyfriend (Stavros) cause she's no longer rich."
62,"I have enjoyed watching this comic show. It helps when you have great characters and writing. I especially love Chris Elliot's character as the mayor. Everything about this show is first rate!
*** out of ****"
63,"This show is genius and talent souped together like a ship in a beautiful little bottle. The acting and characters are all AMAZING. I could not solidly decide which character was my favorite. (I've since settled on Alexis because she's a positivity child and I relate to her the most - even though I'm a gay man.) They all shine so beautifully. The themes, the writing, the comedy, the enviornment, the well drawn out characters & character relationships, etc - it's all just so well done. I could not stop laughing hysterically out loud through scene after scene of pure gold. The comedic scenes, and timing are TOP TIER. ( THIS SHOW IS TOP TIER.)In short, I could not keep my eyes off this show. It's the epitome of binge worthy comedy. I tend to be the kind of person who seldom gets hooked on a tv show; especially those with so many seasons, but I could not keep my mind off of these characters and their melodrama...this show is just so good. I have a group chat with a few friends and in a short review, I told them that this show is like consuming a bunch of macaroons on a nice day. It's just so easy to lose track of the deliciousness.Give this show a chance, and stay until the second season. The first is easily the worst, and that's saying something. :)"
64,I'm a newbie but damn I'm hooked!! Best of the Best!!
65,"I totally love this show! Catherine O'Hara is fantastic and had me laughing out loud. A Eugene and Catherine pairing always works so well. The show is quirky, ironic and really well written and is such a funny portrayal of a rich dysfunctional family. The whole cast play off each other so well, especially the sibling spats Dan Levy and Annie Murphy's characters have. Also the introduction of Chris Elliott's character was genius - he is disgusting in a great way. It gets better as each episode progresses. I can't wait to see more and great news there is a season 2."
66,"Initially it got over elaborated with things getting scattered and nothing seems to make sense as the family members were gathering their lives back. But with the time you involved with the journey and in the end when you look back to what the whole family went through, it runs feeling on satisfaction and delight inside you. A must watch!"
67,"I put off watching this show until there was nothing left...and I wish I had started watching sooner. I was so pleasantly surprised. You really ending up caring about all the characters, even secondary characters that start off as just annoying, they grow on you. I'll admit sometimes the characters did such awkward things that I found it hard to watch, but all in all, the show was sweet and funny and I really enjoyed it. Also ""you're simply the best"", I now love this song and it brings all the feels!!!"
68,"I am an Aussie and I absolutely love this show. It shows love and acceptance while delivering quality comedy.
The last season made me laugh and cry. Such a beautiful ending to a show that has changed the world and made its mark."
69,"This show masquerades as a frothy romp of all that is ridiculous. Ridiculing the hyper-rich and the hick alike. You'll start watching it for the branded showrunner Levy farther & son charm and wit and the impressive supporting cast. But slowly, almost imperceptibly, you will start to really care for these characters, especially David. Season four is where the show finds its heart center. And be prepared for romance and heartwarming love season 4 episode 10. This is a show that keeps you laughing and all the while it is enveloping you in the bear hug you have been craving."
70,"Second episode was even better than the first! I'm hooked.A rare combination of superb writing, acting, and production in a classic fish-out-of-water scenario. Outlandish characters, in perfect satiric hyperbole of our culture, particularly the over-the-top narcissism of the Roses. Their egotistic idiocy is offset by the cuttingly deadpan wit of the desk girl. The equally exaggerated town mayor makes the Roses look normal by comparison. Rapid- fire banter between characters and smart one-liners (""I just want a bath tub and a long extension cord, please!"") had me laughing so much I had to rewind twice to catch it all. Outstanding acting all around.I'm going to watch them again, it's that good."
71,"I absolutely love this show. I came across it this week (on season 2 now) and have to admit, it is holding me up from doing the things I need to do. It is so humorous, I'm laughing on every episode. The writing is just really that good. I like the fact that the episodes are short but sweet. I look forward to next one and the we'll you know what I mean. Thumbs up to the writers and actors. Every actor playing their character is just perfect. They are all great!!! I have never taken the time to write a TV show review, this is my first. I just had to express my appreciation for finding this gem. I walk away feeling happy after watching a few episodes. Thank you all again."
72,"Watching this show has been life changing as a person. It has a healthy, happy, and realistic depiction of a queer romantic relationship. While watching this, I was waiting for the other shoe to drop, expecting the queer romance in the show to end in tragedy, death, or played off as a ""laugh."" I was wrong.It was validating, hopeful, loving, and healthy. I cried, multiple times by how heartfelt and carefully crafted this love was. It felt real.It was the representation I did not realize I had been waiting for, for so many years.The show as a whole is beautiful, genuine, heartfelt, and loving. Gorgeous character development, that is believable and moving to watch.It is a masterpiece of television and I am grateful for it.Thank you folks for making it."
73,"This show, while silly, by design, is very well written, dirirected and superbly performed. The sets, lighting, sound and wardrobe are all top notch. The wardrobe design alone makes me laugh. But the acting is downright craft.
While ultimately a goofy comedy, the characters develop nicely and the the timing and nuance of the actors, young and old, is impressive.
If you are even a marginal fan of Catherine O'Hara and/or Eugene Levy, give this show shot."
74,"Started watching this from around the second or third season, before the glowing amounts of adoration came flooding in.Simply well-cast and engaging character development throughout. I've found myself rewatching whole seasons again in the off-season, as I find it very funny and heartfelt. I'm so glad they only kept it to the six seasons and didn't outstay their welcome, like many a sitcom these days.As always, best to ignore the super low-scoring trolls/haters, as this seems to be a genuinely well-received amongst the populace."
75,"When I first got into watching this show, I thought it would be very funny with lots of jokes. But after watching a few episodes, I realised it wasn't. But I still stuck with it because it has a mild and engaging aura about it. It's not an extraordinary show but it doesn't try to be that. Rather, it makes you smile (occasionally laugh) and admire the point that it tries to make. It's a social commentary about the different mindsets of rich and not-so-rich people. It tries to show that money & materialistic things are crucial for you only until you realise that there are far more important things in life like family, friends, love and career."
76,"I have never seen a comedy show that has so many underlying layers and character development. There are lessons to be learnt, there are stereotypes that are broken and oh my ..the relationship of Patrick and David made my heart melt. This show just rises above all the feel good fluff that is out there and makes such a deep connection. You laugh , you cry and you get hope from this show. It's the only thing that's distracting me during this crazy Corona virus crisis"
77,"Cannot say enough good things. Hilarious. Truly. Just an easy easy watch. Hilarious and the actors r on point. Love this show. I watch it whenever I am getting stressed out! Def has become my go-to show when I need to watch a laugh my a** off n relax show. I absolutely love this show. Love the Levy family and they nailed it w this show. Absolutely one of my all time fav shows for sure. one of my fav aspects of it is how at the start they r this ""family"" ...but not really a family. As the show moves forward and they have lost everything you find them changing and becoming a family they never were b4. So in loosing their 60,000sqft mansion n everything that Super wealthy life entails and moving into 2 motel rooms w a mere 200sft or so it has brought the four of them so much closer. They get to know each other again. Or maybe for the first time. They lost their wealth and world yet gained each other. They have a connection they've never ever had b4 and u can really see how each one of them changes and becomes better humans as time goes on. Of course in the **most hilarious** way possible!"
78,"I am really really picky when it comes to comedy television. Maybe comedy in general.
Sure, I watched cheers and Seinfeld, modern family Too. But none of those shows mad me laugh out loud to the point of tears in my eyes. But Schitts creek, a show where i uncommonly love every character, makes me laugh more than i do in real life.
As i said, i love every character, the show feels like home.If you like quirky tv and love to laugh, this is the right show for you.Usually in comedies, i dont like at least one character, but on schitts creek, every character is endearing and funny. I love everyone!!!!
*****spoilers*****
I love David and Patrick's relationship. It's sweet and also not overbearing. And the fact that the family accepts them, is sweet too."
79,"I had never heard of this show before but when a friend recommended it to me I thought I would give it a try. What a surprise to find this little gem full of so much laughter and humanity. This beautiful show written by father and son, Eugene and David Levy, is a masterpiece. It is the story of a super rich family who loses everything and are forced to move to a backwater town purchased by the father as a joke. Episode by episode we come to know the superficial Rose family grow and become wonderfully human. There is so much heart in this series. It is incredibly respectful in its treatment of so many topical issues. This show and its characters will grow on you. A real gem!"
80,"A friend who rarely recommends TV shows, recommended Schitt's Creek, so I was eager to give it a try. I can suspend disbelief when watching TV or a movie, but I appreciate people acting plausibly. Nobody in Schitt's Creek acts like a real person. Everybody is an ignorant stereotype. The ex-rich Rose family don't act like any rich or successful people I've ever met. In the first episode, Eugene Levy's character, Johnny Rose, is unable to explain to an earthy townie that the family needs time to unpack. Rose is supposed to be a rich video store magnate. He should have some ability to get people to do things. The rest are all neurotic, selfish and self-absorbed. None have any charisma or interpersonal skills. The townies are drawn just as poorly. They seem to be dense and limited, living desperate lives. The actors are generally talented, but the writers really seem to hate people.A person with an appreciation and some experience with a wide range of people would have written a much better show. Successful people may have management skills and the ability look for opportunities. Even rich kids, who travel all over the world, should have some ability to adapt. Townies may be resourceful, grounded and enjoy the small town life. I get its a fish out of water story, but written by people that have never seen fish and hate the water.After watching several episodes, I'm starting to doubt my friend."
81,"I watched the first few episodes, but I don't feel compelled to watch more. 
Like so many other reviewers said, the character of David is just so annoying. This show felt kind of lifeless to me, but that's just my opinion."
82,"This show is so awful I can't figure out why it was ever put on television in the first place. Every aspect of this show is unbelievably horrible. It seems like there is not one single thing they did right.The writing is terrible, it's as if it was written by a pothead in half an hour in exchange for a bag full of Twinkies. The jokes are terrible and the stories and characters don't even make sense. There are also plot holes galore, such big holes in logic you could drive a nonsense truck through them. Whoever writes this show should be banned from television.The acting is terrible. I hate to say it because I love the older actors in this who I recognize as being legends and have loved before, but this show is awful. I mostly blame the writing for not giving them anything to work with and even though they don't come off as bad actors in this not even they can save it.On the other hand the young actors and especially the son who obviously is Levy's real life son are terrible. Any time the son opens his mouth or does another pained facial expression I wanted to throw my remote at the television. He is so over the top and annoying I can't stand it.The idea is stupid to put it basically. So the guy's accountant screws him and the government takes everything away but they let them keep an entire town for some reason? They own a town? And they lose everything else but are allowed to keep it when obviously it would have a lot of cash value. Then they move there and three quarters of the family starts shrieking.None of the show is realistic and none of the characters act even remotely like a real person would act. It's a shame this show is so bad but it is."
83,"I wanted to like Schitt's Creek, I really did. With so many great performances between them, from SCTV to all those Christopher Guest movies, my sense of anticipation was high when I first heard Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy were to star in a new CBC comedy. It just isn't funny--and it's not just my opinion. Compared to ""Silicon Valley"" which makes me laugh to the point of tears, even on repeat viewings, this one barely makes me crack a smile. I am reminded of cartoonist Bill Griffiths' comment about ""Ozzie and Harriet"", which he described as ""low key to the point of somnambulism"". Ditto for Schitt's Creek, and for that matter, Corner Gas, another totally unfunny Canuck comedy. Most of these things just try too hard, and the writing just isn't there. The biggest drag on SC is Dan Levy and Annie Murphy, whom, especially Murphy, must have chronic indigestion for all their chewing of the scenery. I have heard Eugene Levy wax rhapsodic about the creative talents of his son. It just ain't there Eugene, it just ain't there..."
84,"It's so hard to begin this review, I've been such a fan of Eugene Levy my whole life and he's such a funny human being but when I watch this show Schitt's Creek, I have never seen better writing ,better cast ,better acting ,better humor, just everything blows my mind. My hat's off to Eugene and Daniel Levy for this masterpiece I love it."
85,"Don't be a bebe and watch this show!! Never have I seen a comedy show quite like this, where the goal is to make you laugh and the comedy is genuine and is very rooted in reality. It stands out in terms of quality and its focus on storytelling.The greatest thing about this show is its characters, they all start at point A and eventually reach point B by the finale, they aren't just there to be there. It is refreshing because its not random things happening like in most shows today, this is an incredibly well-crafted sitcom. Its intelligent, witty, quick and actually funny. This has become one of my favorite shows of all time!! I binged it in less than a week because of its incredible writing, acting from an ensemble cast. That is not an understatement, the acting is top notch from every character brought into the show and the seeing the faces so often with everyone having their own quirks and personalities that when the show wraps up, the impact of it ending is reminiscent of Friends; it is a goodbye you know is coming but it is one you don't want... because that would mean it's over. You get to watch these well fleshed out characters evolve season after season. If you are looking to laugh and want to watch something done well, watch this show!! If you ask me, Netflix should start getting the hint and focus on bringing out more shows of this quality onto its streaming services."
86,"The first season or two I didn't like this show that much. I thought nothing happened in the plot and it wasn't that funny. Season 3 and on I was obsessed with the show and I'm now rewatching. I think ANYONE could watch this show and enjoy it, just give it time. It's so funny and even better on a rewatch. The peak in my opinion is the Cabaret storyline in season five. I'm a huge theatre nerd and seeing theatre really help someone gain confidence made me soooo happy. Additionally, the character Alexis has some of the best character growth I've ever seen on tv. Everyone in the show is phenomenal and there's not an episode that I don't like. Schitts Creek is simply the best!!!"
87,Such a heartwarming show with great comedy and love
88,"I absolutely love it, and find it very interestingly"
89,I fell in love with every single character of this show..
90,"I have never been this compelled to make a review about a TV show. I decided to give this show a try on Netflix because, why not? Ever since the first episode, I was instantly hooked. The family's entire life shattered, forcing them to move to a small town in a motel. From there we meet these characters that each are their own person, style. The story was so good. I couldn't wait to watch the next episode. I don't think I disliked one episode.The character development is amazing. You see each character grow, for the better. You see this family that didn't know much about each other, forced to live with each other, learn more and love more. This show does not have flashy things or over the top plot twists - it is simple and that's where it shines. I never wanted more or less. It delivered perfectly, just the way it is.I just finished watching this show and am so sad it is over. The show ended on such a good note. I wish there were many more episodes to come but I understand why it ended - it was perfect. Judging based off other reviews, there are many people who feel the same way. Please, you need to watch this show. In our COVID world, this show will transport you out of these troubling times for hours to come.Eugene, Dan, and everybody who birthed this show and made it such a wonderful experience through and through, thank you very much."
91,"I would have given 7.5 if the option was there.I do like this show and the humour took a while to understand but once the characters quirks are learnt then it is a funny show. In particular for me Ted and Bob on the periphery of the show are very funny.The reason I don't go as high as 9/10 which I think was possible if ended different is because of the character development.The character and sorry develops wonderfully but for me the ending missed the mark. David's character ended well. But for Alexis and Moira/Jonny I didn't like it.The whole story seemed to be the message that yes they were materially rich before but they weren't a family or truly happy. Their friends ditched them when the money was lost. But the new town they made friends with all sorts of people who were genuinely nice.But then Alexis, Moira and Jonny are still ecstatic to be leaving. I'm not saying they had to stay but to me it seems like they went from being rich but not truly happy to a happy life to then throw it all away to chase money once more. Not one of Alexis friends visited her but in the blink of an eye she's moving to NYC.I just feel the ending went against how the story and characters had developed throughout.That being said I'd recommend watching."
92,This is the best tv series I have ever watched and I love it so much. I have never cried at a tv show before but this left me sad and desperate to re-watch it. I think that everyone should watch this series and I just hope that they get as much out of it as I did.
93,This show is definitely worth your time. Period. 😊
94,Great show. Character development is on point! Love every single episode.. I'm laughing my ass off! All of the haters can suck it..
95,"The Roses were extremely rich because of Rose Video. They end up losing everything and have their belongings taken from them in their home.They resort to their only property left which Johnny bought as a joke for David in a town called Schitt's Creek.This high maintenance family cannot stand the low-end motel and small town life. The middle-aged son and daughter are called ""kids"" by their parents. The kids go to the town parties, the bar, and meet new people.Over the years we watch the kids grow into more simpler people with a changed attitude. They start their own careers - David with Rose Apothecary, Alexis being a PR for her mother. We see moments where they show kindness.David realizes his ""friends"" when he was rich are no longer in contact with him. Stevie, an awkward secretary becomes friends with David. She ends up becoming David's maid of honour.Alexis meets Mutt Schitt at a party. We don't see him again much after they break up. Alexis is proposed to by the town's vet named Ted but unfortunately they do not end up together.Moira becomes used to the more simpler lifestyle and is excited when she receives an offer to star in the next Crowening movie. At the premiere they hold in town an accidental ""stunt"" makes the premiere viral and number one on Interflix.Johnny wants to try another business again. He uses Bob's garage for his ""office"" but has to serve the clients that come in as Bob mentions he is giving free space for Johnny so he mind as well do so. After Stevie's aunt dies and she is the new owner of the motel, Johnny joins Stevie to make the motel successful. They go on to NYC to propose to investors the idea of buying motels around the country and improving them.The Schitts are out of touch with pop culture. Jocelyn is a high school teacher and is married to the town's mayor who isn't the brightest. They get pregnant and Jocelyn drives herself to the hospital. They have boy named Roland Moira Schitt. Mutt comes back to see his new baby brother.Ronnie is hilarious - she is this black, bug-eyed woman who is so unbothered. Twyla works as a server at the cafe and we learn she actually won the lottery. She does not work for money but she actually loves her job. She says she has everything right here in this town despite having millions. Ted is the town's vet. He is handsome and smart - picks up on cues and we see his professional doctor skills. Mutt is the estranged first son of the Schitts - Roland complains he never sees Mutt and Mutt does nothing with his life. He could become mayor if he wants to."
96,"It definitely starts slowly but grows on you fast and before you know it, you know the characters by heart and can't let go. The show gets better by season and i laughed a lot as well shed tears. Amazing how they treated LGBT+characters with such happiness and positivity, and showing how normal and real they are. Very rare an its something all shows should do. David is my favorite character for sure and his and Patrick's love story is one if not the best relationships I've seen on tv shows. Bittersweet to let the Rose family go after just discovering this show but I will surely rewatch this show many times."
97,"I haven't even heard about this show untill the Emmys, i watched it and it didn't disappoint me. The plot,the characters everything is just perfect all together makes it a great comedy show ever created. Enjoyed watching it."
98,I wish it never ended! All the actors and storylines are Perfection. I Lol constantly and cannot believe how well the writers and actors nailed it. It's a Must See for Everyone!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
99,"I'm not trashing this show out of hate or bias. I'm trashing this show because it is absolute garbage. The fish out of water premise works and can be funny, but not with this show. The writing kills Schitt's Creek. The jokes are totally unfunny and fall flat. What makes this worse is that the audience sees where the writers are trying to make a joke hit but they all ultimately fall flat. The characters are all one-dimensional stereotypes. This could work in a true satire but this is not one. The story is about a wealthy, superficial family who loses everything and moves to a small town with small town people. The ""comedy"" is shown in their disconnectedness from reality and their journey trying to find their way in this small town. Where the show fails in is in the stereotypical portrayal of the wealthy. The acting and characters are simply too unbelievable and goofy. In order for anything to work, it has to be based in at least a little truth. No one is this stupid in real life. And let's not forget, on top of bad writing and characters, the jokes are just not funny. And on top of all of this, the production design sucks. Honestly, I was shocked at the awfulness of this show. I still love you Catherine O'Hara! Don't be mad at me!"
100,"Another ""fish out of the water"" comedy.Either is a big shot corporate lawyer who loses her job and work as a public defender (Benched) or a spoiled rich girl who ends up serving tables at a terrible dinner (2 Broke girls), this is turns out to be a favorable premise for TV comedic writers. And of course we've seen literally hundreds of movies like this, since forever.Anyway. The important question is, ""is it entertaining""? Well... NO!To begin with, all the characters are paper thin. 2 shallow spoiled adult kids and a neurotic mother, come along with an ex-rich guy who lost his money because he trusted blindly his accountant.The acting is also not good. Eugene Levy is a veteran in the field but you can do so little when the script is flat and the dialogs uninspiring and boring.Dan Levy, Eugene's son, is terrible, with an over-the-top mannerism and poor imitations of his father's grimaces.All the efforts for a joke fail miserably, unless you think a stick bathroom window after someone ""overused"" the toilet is funny. Or asking someone unsuccessfully for the same thing 100 times (like get me a towel or please leave from our room).Overall: Schitt happens, but at least on TV you can avoid them."
101,"I mean we've never heard of him and when I click on his name I see he has done literally nothing except MTV Live which was such garbage I never watched it again and apparently forgot he was even on it, but so what?His father is funny so let's give Eugene Levy's son his own TV series. We can let him direct and star and write and executive produce and do everything else he wants, and just assume that he knows what he is doing because he is Eugene Levy's son. We can throw a ton of taxpayer's money at him and let him have his own show.While we're at it, does Catherine O'Hara have a daughter? Can we also give her a ton of money and a show when she's done nothing to prove she actually has any talent of her own?After watching this show, I am completely surprised to see that it was not very funny. O'Hara and Eugene Levy were funny, but Eugene Levy's son wasn't. The writing stunk and so did the show. It doesn't make sense because Eugene Levy's son is Eugene Levy's son, so genetically speaking it's pretty much guaranteed that the show should be awesome, yet it is not.Anyway let's give him more money to do another season because if anyone can turn this show around it's Eugene Levy's son. He's Eugene Levy's son! Eugene Levy's! Son! He's Eugene Levy's son and he should therefore have his very own TV show!"
102,"This show is crap.I hated every second of watching it and wonder why I tried in the first place.Two back to back episodes and in that entire hour I don't think I laughed even just one time. In 60 minutes they told all those jokes and all of them were bad. How could they have so many jokes and not even be funny once? Not even one time? Put a random person on TV and tell them to make up jokes they'll at least get lucky one time in a full hour won't they?The characters are the worst especially the kids in the family. No offence to the SCTV stars in this who are awesome in their old shows but it seems like they are just in this to collect some easy money for showing up and reading lines. This is not a good show so why else would they be in it?Whoever wrote this show needs to watch more TV or go to comedy school to learn what real people actually think is funny, because this is awful.It takes a lot to get me off my ass to do the work of actually writing a review to say how bad a show is and after last night this show made that list. Awful awful show."
103,"This show is terrible, terrible, terrible. Worst of all is Dan Levy who is so uniformly awful I don't think there's been a single second he's been on screen every time I've watched this show where I feel comfortable watching him or really feel anything less than angry. The level of nepotism that must be involved in order to get this completely untalented moron a show and to keep it on the air for this many years must be out of this world. I'm insulted that my tax dollars are being wasted on this guy and his humourless show."
104,"CBC promoted the heck out of this series with all sorts of publicity and taking the somewhat unusual step of having The National anchor, Peter Mansbridge, and Hockey Night in Canada's Jim Hughson promote the show during their broadcasts prior to the premiere. In retrospect, perhaps that should have told us something.I have watched the first three episodes now and feel confident in stating this show is terrible. It is a bit hard to understand with Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara of SCTV fame as the leading characters. And in fairness, Eugene Levy's performance is not bad, although O'Hara's take on her character seems to be a variation on her Gloria Swanson/Norma Desmond impression in a take-off of ""Sunset Boulevard"". Hugely annoying.But the rest of the cast, especially Dan Levy's performance, is terrible. Chris Elliott has a track record elsewhere, but his performance here is that of an unlikable, almost creepy character that is not at all appealing. Annie Murphy's daughter character is just annoying and dumb, and when the best you can say is that Emily Hampshire's desk clerk character is your favourite, when she has maybe 60 seconds worth of screen time, you know you are in trouble.But for all that, the real problem is the how the rather weak concept is produced and written. It is hard to understand how 3 episodes of a comedy series can result in not only zero laughs, but not even a grin, as was the case for me in watching this. The sun never seems to shine here, and the interior sets are dismal and gloomy too as per the premise. So you have bad performances, unpleasant characters, poor scripts, unappealing sets, and a premise that seems based on some pretty crude jokes.It is truly awful. It is hard to believe just how bad it really is. How it got an order from CBC for a second season before the first episodes even reached air deserves some hard questions. I suspect this will go down the drain quickly with only the stench remaining to remind us of yet another CBC folly.Edited to add: A number of new, very positive reviews of this show have appeared within the last week, all with virtually unanimous positive ""helpful"" scores. Many of these reviews are from accounts that have just been created. Is someone from the production company stuffing the ballot box? I hope IMDb examines these."
105,"Schitt's Creek is just a bad show. I'm pretty insulted actually that CBC is giving it another season when everything I read says that the ratings crashed down to almost nothing and it must cost a lot of money to get these big name actors. Renewing a show before it even started airing is just stupid isn't it?This show has a lot of problems. Levy and O'Hara and Elliott are all totally wasted. They get in the occasional good line but that's more to do with them being pro's and less to do with the material they have to work with which is garbage. The daughter is OK but the son is really atrocious and he is also the producer, director and creator of the show, so it's not like he can be fired as an actor. Why is he there? I can only assume it's because he's his father's son. Levy is a legend so who would insult him by telling him his son is awful and untalented and has to be let go?The jokes are lame and also predictable and the plot let alone the whole premise of the show is nonsensical. How is it possible to own a town and why would any of these people act this way? We're supposed to believe they remain just as stupid and illogical after their circumstances have been changed for so long? How does anyone own a town and if they owe so much money why didn't the government also take the town away? If they own the town why don't they use that with leverage with people... since you can't own a town they must own all the buildings in it, so they could say ""do this because I own your house/business and if you don't I will evict you."" Biggest question of all..... if they do somehow ""own a town"" (which is impossible) and hate it and are so one-dimensionally snooty about living better WHY NOT SELL THE TOWN AND BUY ONE NICE HOUSE? Or buy a new business so dad can make his fortune back?The entire show makes no sense and it's a shame to see such legends wasted on it. I'd rather watch a much cheaper show where Levy and O'Hara just talk to an audience, answer questions and do improv. I'm not just saying that, I would seriously watch that show. As long as his son isn't also on it.One last thing, I hate fake reviews. Like, I really really despise them. IMDb you need to figure out a way to weed out these robots or cast/crew members and their family and friends who obviously sign up just to post glowing reviews en masse. They hide all the real reviews which I found informative (and in some cases much funnier than the show itself) and I don't understand what purpose they serve anyway. Even if they trick someone into checking out the show, they're just going to see how bad it is and then not watch again. Hence the awful ratings plummet."
106,"I saw adverts for this when it first aired on itv in the UK and never thought of watching it, but I was bored and trawling through Netflix and found it and saw Catherine O'Hara was in it so decided to give it a go as I enjoy watching her very much and it did exceed all of my expectations.There really are not many things I will rave about as I tend to dislike most things but this I loved and my partner even saw me watching it and had me start it again so he could watch it too.Yes the basic format has, like most things, been done before, what makes this stand apart is the characters.The Roses start as your stereotypical mega rich, spoilt family. At the start they barely have any connection with each other or reality and their ignorance and unwillingness to accept their new life, or each other, throughout most of the first series portrays this. What makes it work better is that over time each of them finds their own little crutches that helps them integrate with reality and helps them build a better family unit. I don't want to go into too much detail as I think it speaks better for itself but one of my favourite things about it is the relationships the characters build. It is also pretty refreshing to see a gay couple that is portrayed as a normal couple as opposed to ridiculous and dysfunctional, they are shown as genuinely loving each other and caring for each other, but the same goes for the parents. There is none of the typical drivel of the bickering couples you always see in sitcoms, they always try to support each other.Basically give it a go for the characters and their development I say."
107,"We loved the first few seasons of this show, but it's plummeting downhill really fast. By the end of Season 4, it felt like the characters were all evolving and it was even touching to see the transformation. But with Season 5, it feels like the writers don't know where to go.
We loved Alexa's character earlier on but now it feels like she's morphed into David.
We hope the writers can get their acts together soon!"
108,Chris Elliott was obviously kidnapped and forced to be in this show at gunpoint. I know this because he used to be one of the funniest people on TV and now he's playing a one dimensional moron reading jokes from the most poorly written scripts I've ever seen performed on television. If he's doing this willingly I'm no longer a fan. This show is so bad I simply can't believe it's on television. Oh and I agree with the huge number of reviews here who think Dan Levy is the most untalented schmuck in TV history and who are suspicious that these thousands of glowing ratings and reviews the popped up are not genuine. I don't know any people in real life who have watched this show and actually enjoy it.
109,"I'm not sure where all of these glowing positive reviews and ratings are coming from. Are we watching completely different shows or is this some kind of vote rigging where these votes have been purchased? Or maybe are the cast and crew of this show voting again and again to drag this show up?This show is not funny. The acting and writing are painfully bad. The worst thing of all is definitely the character of Eugene Levy's son who is played by his real life son, who is so annoyingly bad and unfunny I literally threw my remote control at my TV, which was a big mistake because then it took me several seconds longer to retrieve it and change the channel.Universal opinion of friends, work and everyone here in my family is that this show sucks so I honestly wonder who you people are who like it and are watching it. I have not met one of you in real life, that's for sure."
110,The characters just yell at each other and the story is supeeeer cliche. A waste of time!
111,"This show is terrible.Eugene Levy's son is probably the worst comedy actor I have ever seen in my entire lift. He really is so bad that every time he is on screen and especially every time he opens his stupid whiny mouth I want to find the nearest heavy object and smash my own skull open with it to spare myself any more suffering. That might be a slight exaggeration but only a slight one because yes Eugene Levy's son really is that bad at acting.Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara are both good in their parts but they are totally wasted in this. Their characters are about as deep as a sidewalk crack.The stories, jokes and writing are total garbage. I could coax better writing and funnier jokes out of my three year old with the promise of a cookie before nap time. It's sick to think that a lot of people are being paid a lot of money to make crap like this, particularly when many much better shows have been canceled. Typical CBC!Do yourself a favour and avoid this show at all costs, it is a pitiful effort."
112,"I watched this show because I am a huge fan of basically every SCTV cast member. Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara are comedy legends and Canadian legends and they alone should make a show worth watching. Unfortunately everything and I mean everything else about this show is so cringe worthy I couldn't watch it any more, even for them.Levy and O'Hara are still good. The few times I smiled in seasons one and two were because of them. But not even they can milk funny out of the garbage they are given to say and do by the writers. All the jokes are repetitive and the unfunny, over the top situations just get amped up more and more in a constant effort to try to one up themselves.Everything is predictable and nothing is funny. None of the characters are remotely believable. None of their actions are believable or funny. There is no logic and the continuity is even flawed before they even get done the first season.Worst of all are the other actors. One woman and Chris Elliott are OK (again they don't exactly have much to work with) but the entire rest of the supporting cast is awful, just awful. One of the guys is so bad you can tell by watching that he must be the producer's son, and he is (Dan Levy), so I guess it's obvious that really is how he got his job. His over the top screeching and ham-fisted and ham-faced acting are enough to drag this show down to a negative 10 rating. Luckily for him the stars of the show are all class.Avoid this show like the plague or end up angry and bitter about the wasted time like me. Also I have to point out it is kind of suspicious that this show is so highly rated by so may new accounts and that thousands of ratings popped up in a 24 hour period. It's possible they are all genuine but I'm not sure it passes the smell test so I hope IMDb will look into it.Final verdict: Not funny, good stars but awful supporting characters, some of the worst writing I've ever seen in a TV series, nothing interesting enough and nobody likable or funny enough to keep watching. I give this one an F."
113,There was nothing resembling a good joke in the pilot episode and everything was as predictable as yesterday's weather. Rich family thrown out of their mansion yet they own an entire small town? I don't get it. The show is like a bad episode of Green Acres and they were all bad. So we begin with a tired premise and from there we are given stock characters without a trace of humor or originality and then there is the fact that the writing is amateurish. One of the gags in the first episode is the doors are taken off their motel rooms. I don't get it. How is that funny? Don't answer that because I already know the answer: it isn't funny. The two children are completely annoying which isn't synonymous with funny. Toilet humor rears its ugly head early on. Comedy has gone to this little town to die.
114,"To begin with, I watch a lot of comedy on TV and I feel that I know what I like and what I don't. The vast majority of N. American comedy is absolute dross. I would much rather watch 6 great episodes of a well written show from GB, New Zealand or France than 13-24 episodes of over- hyped laugh-track filled crap. That's just me. Now, on to Schitt's Creek. I'm always willing to give a show a fair chance. I did this for Big Bang Theory, Two Broke Girls, Corner Gas and several others. They were almost all universally awful. I watched SC and while I don't love it, it is head and shoulders above most others. It has some very funny moments but not enough to keep me watching. Much of the humour is low-brow, lavatory based and annoying. Too little time, to much good TV out there.So in conclusion, A lot of people like the show. I don't think much of it. It's a big world and there are a myriad of opinions. Well, à chacun son goût."
115,"I like quirky offbeat comedies and am a bid fan of Arrested Development.Everything felt forced, the comedy felt forced, the 'anger' feels forced, the drama is completely forced and worst of all..the acting is forced. I gave it several episodes and never laughed, smiled or even chuckled once. Being overly bratty, overly annoying, over the top everything does not constitute as funny.If you are the type of personality that laughs at the simplest of things, maybe this show works for you. If you want your laughs earned, you may be disappointed. This is definitely for the Big Bang Theory/Friends comedy crowd."
116,I rewatch this show daily. I think everyone does an amazing job!
117,"I love this show! It is smart, witty and exactly what the world needs right now!"
118,I love everything about this show. Perfect quirkiness to keep me in an extra good mood :)
119,"First season: Great. Second season started the slide, now a 4/10 is being very generous. David was the clear star of the show early on with his quirky and sometimes hilarious metrosexual manners, that has now decended into a nonstop play of
gay angst and preening man love with his Rose Apothecary co-partner. Its sickening actually. Alexis is still as funny as she is totally clueless, but her mom Moira is so
overly pretentious and tacky and so unlikeable sometimes I wonder why I even bother. Chris Elliot is wasted on this series, but I guess they can't get rid of Mr. Schitt. As usual Eugene Levy's understated and dry with are the clear highlight of whats left of this Schitt Show. Here's hoping for improvement in Season 5, but considering
the direction they're headed I won't hold my breath."
120,"It's hard to find a good comedy in the world of ever growing choice we have... I have to admit, the ads for this did not do it for me but once I was half way through episode 2 I'm hooked! Likeable characters, great writing, just wow.My boyfriend knows when I watch this because he can hear me laughing outloud. So SO good. I love David Rose more than life.Well done Levys!! Defo worth a watch anyone on the look for a light comedy with laugh out loud moments!"
121,Well this was a treat indeed because of the familiar faces and the new ones that you can appreciate as they are the beautiful children of their incredibly talented parents and who are equally talented. Funny doesn't do it justice because it's the kind of funny you don't see anymore and quick. On all levels it is the best new show and I'm a big fan.
122,"The actors who played the characters as the ""kids"" are irritating and annoying."
123,"Top favorite, so much fun. The many faces of David are great. Now that love is in the air, I'm excited to see more. Funny for the entire family."
124,"Witty, elegant, charming. I have never submitted an online review prior to this show. It's 10/10 with having fresh comedy, hot topics, and an all-star cast with electric chemistry. You can tell from how the series progresses that the cast works harmoniously with each and continues to builds."
125,"I am not kidding when I say I've watched all 6 seasons 8 times!!! The character development is genius and the humor is outstanding! Moira and David are my favorite. There's humor in every line, every quip and every banter I just can't get enough!"
126,I have not LOL'd in a long time like this and every episode too. Season 1 episode 3 especially is where it all takes off ... every character in town is a character to love but the Levy clan especially delivers in every which way possible. A MUST MUST watch.
127,"I started watching this show during quarantine, hoping to find something to take my mind off the outside world and the anxiety I felt. I binged all 6 seasons very quickly, and truly felt like I lost some of my best friends when it was over. I watch A LOT of television, and I've never found a show that brought me this much joy and happiness. The character development of each person In Schitt's Creek is so remarkable and you really grow to love these characters.Please please please make sure you give it time to get into the storyline and the characters. The show was always great, but the introduction of a romance in season 3 really upped my love for the show. It really hits its stride as each season progresses.I can't say enough good things about this show. I always turn to it when I need something to uplift my spirits."
128,"Arguably one of the best shows of all time! Just get your popcorn and relax for the most wholesome show, with a brilliant cast, exceptional writing and amazing comedy. In this day and age where most of sitcoms are just long monotonous season after season of rinse and repeat, Schitt's creek takes it throws it in the bin and shows how its done! The comedy and characters are perfectly intertwined, It takes the plotline of riches to rags in a way that has never been done before. The ending is the probably best out of any sitcom I have ever watched and the definitely the only one that almost made me tear up!
So ditch whatever you are watching right now and go enjoy the six seasons of absolute fun, enjoyment and complete charm of this amazingly crafted show."
129,"Superb all the way around! The amazing Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy, both SCTV alumnae, shine in this off-beat, often hilarious, sometimes poignant, always well written series. The supporting cast is also excellent as are the direction and writing. We're sorry to see it go, but we look forward to revisiting the Rose family in the world of syndication."
130,"This show is absolutely genius for so many reasons. Once you realize the brilliance in the writing of this show, you will not want to put this down. The actors are also just perfect for every character.... the amount of expressiveness by all of them, never seen it on any show ever, and it's just so perfect. The story / character progression is just so perfectly paced as well, and it all wraps up really well.Just give it a shot. It's brilliant."
131,So very day this show is coming to an end. There's no other show like it. Funny and heartwarming. Catherine O'Hara is phenomenal! Love Dan and Eugene Levy too Please don't end
132,"Wow, how did I miss this gem? I truly hope Dan realizes how rare it is to find gold in a stream. Unlike Seinfeld, Friends, Everybody Loves Raymond & Two and a Half Men (4 TV comedies that ran their course); this show feels like it still has so much more to offer than 6 short seasons.
If you can find it, binge. This is the best thing I've discovered, and I have the Corona Virus Outbreak to thank."
133,"Great cast, funny, the son is by far the best character and the sister is totally hot and plays a Promiscuous imbecile... the perfect girl .... it really is a good show"
134,"This is one of the few TV shows that I feel is worth the effort to actually review. I watched S1-S4 on Netflix over the past few weeks, and it took no time whatsoever for it to become my favorite comedy since The Office. The entire cast is simply phenomenal. You have the real life father-son duo of Eugene & Dan Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Chris Elliott, and countless other supporting actors and actresses who all somehow fit perfectly. The witty, sarcastic and clever humor that permeates every episode from start to finish simply cannot be topped by anything else out there.As much as I love Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara's roles, the star of the series for me is Dan Levy. The humor he brings through the enunciation of his very witty comments, and his priceless facial expressions and occasional (okay, maybe not so occasional) hand wringing brought me nearly to tears more times than I could count.But this isn't simply a comedy, it's about growth: a dysfunctional family that once had it all loses everything and is forced to swallow their pride and adapt... and change. There is comedy everywhere, but there is also soul-searching, love and love lost, identity crises, and so much more. The journey you will take by buckling up your seatbelt and going for the ride will be unforgettable.My only criticism is that I WISH the episodes were longer, as they only run ~20-25 minutes. But given that those 20-25 minutes are pure gold, I really can't complain too much.This show touched me in so many ways, and I can't say that about many shows. In terms of overall quality, I would have no reservations putting this right up there with the behemoths of any TV series genre (not just the comedy genre... ANY genre).If you're on the fence about watching for whatever reason, just watch a few episodes - again, they're short but they shine like polished gems. 10/10"
135,I absolutely LOVE this show and the characters. Everyone has developed from episode to episode and season to season. I literally have a hard time stopping once I begin and always laugh out loud during any given episode. It's refreshing and always leaves you feeling happy.
136,"First of all how does this show get higher than 7 out of 10 on this page and that many votes? I suspect serious Frank D'Angelo level vote tampering and ballot box stuffing if that is that case because I can't think of one single real life person who has seen this show and not hated it.Not even my own parents who love EVERYTHING on CBC, absolutely every single show they see they love, even some other real crap in the past like Royal Canadian Air Farce and Little Mosque on the Prairie... not even they liked this show. This show is predictable, unfunny and un- watchable.IMDb needs to do something about their voting rules and weed out some of the obviously fake positive, glowing reviews here. This show is just garbage.The star (Levy Jr.) is also one of the worst ""actors"" I have ever seen on television. Shows like this are why CBC is dying as a network."
137,"How can anyone as talented as Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara turn out such infantile, irritating and unfunny garbage? How anyone can consider this show even remotely funny and give it the ratings that they do speaks volumes about the (abysmally low) average intelligence level of the few remaining people who watch live television. Apparently annoying and stupid people are what's considered funny these day ala 'Jackass' from MTV and every Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott movie ever made. And whoever told Chris Elliott that he was EVER funny - or even one tenth the comedian that his father was - was an idiot. Were I a Canadian taxpayer I would be screaming for whatever portion of my money went to finance this schitt."
138,"Still on the 1st season and I swear each episode gets shorter and shorter. Just watched episode 12 and I can count on one hand how many times this season has made me laugh so far.I think this show is over-hyped by many reviewers - its really not that funny.I constantly have to keep asking myself, whats the point of this again?.. why am i still watching it??I find much of the acting very cringey, mainly due to poor comedy that fails to cause a laugh - In fact the only thing that does cause a laugh are the outfits worn by Daniel Levy.As much as I admire and adore Eugene Levy his performance alone is not enough to keep me watching."
139,"Perhaps I don't like this show because I didn't like Corner Gas and this is quite similar. Writing good comedy is extremely difficult and I think that's what's wrong with all this CBC garbage that's been coming for quite a few years now.I just don't understand all these shows that have no laugh track but aren't even the slightest bit funny. What are you supposed to do when you watch them? I'm wondering if they're being written FOR and BY people who are taking antidepressants, making the show some kind of accompanying panacea that people watch to put them into a mindless stupor. Perhaps shows like this help people who are really mentally in a bad place or have returned from battle and are suffering PTSD and just want to zoo out and not laugh or cry or feel any kind of emotion at all.Anyhow it's pretty sad to see two people from SCTV having to resort to being in such a boring show."
140,"I was cheering for show despite the fact that, unlike sketch comedy shows like SCTV and Kids in the Hall, and radio shows like The Irrelevant Show, Canadian sitcoms have tended to fall flat on their faces. The first episode started off little better than the typical committee-produced Hollywood sitcom, without a lot of laughs. But it grew on me by the second episode with its low-key quirky humour (somewhat disguised by the lack of a laugh track). Eugene Levy is a fine form as a fish out of water, and fellow SCTV alum Catherine O'Hara is effective (though a bit strident) as his freaked-out wife. Emily Hampshire is especially good as the grounded motel ""concierge,"" playing off the stridency of the Rose family. With some good direction and writing, and a focus on keeping this an ensemble piece (and a reigning in the broader acting of the junior Roses), Schitt's Creek could morph into a Canadian Arrested Development. We'll see."
141,"Wow, what a lot of haters.
I found this show highly entertaining and addictive.
Great for late and night after work, where I just wanted to be entertained without thinking too much.
The casting and character development is spot on.From the adds I was expecting this to be just another riches to rags story, but no not at all, I haven't seen anything like this before. The show appears well thought out"
142,"There are few things in entertainment more sad and disappointing than witnessing a talented cast, three of whom are now middle-aged, relentlessly circle the drain with juvenile, dimwit bathroom humor. Where are the brilliant writers? Canadians as a whole are far to clever to get any real satisfaction out of this pre-teen script. Anyone who finds this show 'hilarious' has my sympathy and also my envy, as ignorance is apparently bliss. As if the title wasn't somehow enough, we also must endure a script consistent in its petty presentation of poop-jokes. It makes sense that they would write a CBC show for a pre- teen audience, but this is just bad, and over-acted beyond tolerable. This show will be canceled within the upcoming season. The writing is on the bathroom wall."
143,This is such a great show and everything about is is top notch. Highly recommended
144,"I wasn't captivated by the first episode but ended up binging the 6 seasons in one month.
As explained by others, this show really goes from strenghts to strengths. I believe making a comedy series is extremely hard and I really want to thank the whole team for putting such a great show together.
Yes, the characters are caricatural but they are very endearing and funny! It's also very accessible comedy where you're never left wondering. Accepting everyone's weirdness and taking people for who they are would definitely be the main message of the show. I cried a few times too.I loved watching the interviews with the crew members at the very end."
145,I can't believe that this show lived on my watchlist for soooooooooooo long before I finally watched it on Netflix (finished it 10 minutes ago). I watched the entire 6 seasons in 4 days during Covid-19 Lockdown (I had to work sometimes! Otherwise I would have watched it quicker ). Schitt's Creek is perfect. I laughed out loud at every single episode. I'm gonna miss this show so very very much. Schitt's Creek is the best written show in FOREVER. Bring on the DVD/BluRay release (which I hope will of course have a plethora of extras and bloopers)
146,"It's funny how whole of the cast connects with you with time. The show is filled with humour and a lots of humour. The best part is that the supporting cast is as much as great as the lead ones. Eugene And Dan Lavy seriously did an amazing job and gave us a brilliant comedy stuff.
I didn't expect Schitt's Creek to turn out to be such a wonderful show. The final goodbye really made me cry my heart out. Every season finale or is should say every single episode is written so well that I didn't seem like they were on any script. The plot seemed to be honest and the way episodes are directed makes them so heart warming. It probably is the best ensemble I've ever seen with its own small beautiful moments in it."
147,Wow. Talk about perfect casting. Every single character in this series is incredible. I can't say enough about this show. Beyond hilarious and I laugh out loud several times in each episode. WATCH!!!
148,"I started watching SC after it swept the Emmys and now I understand why. I didn't think there would ever be another show to binge that's worthy of my time. Boy was I wrong. The writing is superb and I just love how the characters develop from season to season. I will admit that Moira's accent was super annoying throughout season 1, but then from season 2 it tempered and became tolerable. I will miss the show after it ends. Why did it take so long to win so many Emmys?"
149,"I can't remember the last time I felt genuinely upset to have finished a show. I cried my eyes out during the last episode of Schitts Creek because it felt like saying goodbye to friends. Granted, watching it during Corona 2020 probably made it all the more impactful (lack of human contact, constantly a nervous wreck anyway etc etc). The beauty of Schitts Creek is in the character development, and seasons 1-2 start slow. It was probably only the final episode of season 2 that I started to feel warmly towards every single character. But the creators confidently take their time, they know the direction they're going in and have decided not to compromise realism for a quick win. The result is rewarding and you really feel as though you've watched these characters change as they navigate financial ruin, family dramas, heartbreak, love and life. It's a good natured show that highlights the best in humanity without making characters too perfect - they all have their quirks and annoyances. It also portrays one of the most realistic, non-stereotypical gay relationships I have ever seen on screen. It's definitely one I will rewatch so I can return to the home comforts of Schitts Creek."
150,Just amazing! Couple of initial episodes do not promote how wonderfully ingenious this series is. One of the best things you will ever watch.
151,"I was unsure with season 1. The writing seemed to still be finding its groove, but it really takes off from 2 onwards, maintaining the light yet clever humour all the way to the end.A lot of the humour resonates with gay humor, so I'll assume some of the low scores are from people who stopped on season 1 or really don't get sarcasm, pop culture references and situational humour.Catherine O'Hara is just a gem. She should get this year's Emmy, but the actress who plays Alexis (forgot his name) is a pleasant surprise. Playing a likeable brat is not that easy.If you are after a light yet clever comedy, this is definitely a go."
152,"Having had my fill of sitcoms based on friends and their lives, when this show came along my interest was piqued naturally. Every new sitcom around the time this came out was trying to attempt something different but I don't think any of those others were as well done.
Without giving much away, a show about rich & spoilt brats having to learn and make their own way in the world, when thrown in with a lot of comedy in between, definitely made for an interesting watch than most other friends based ones I have tired of.The characters are well developed, all major ones are given adequate character development and their arcs are satisfactory for the most part. The comedy and its delivery varies as per the actors, from Emily Hampshire's (Stevie) deadpan delivery, to the exaggerated facial expressions of the brilliant Dan Levy. Eugene Levy (of the American Pie movies) is good as usual but Catharine O'Hara (Moira Rose) and Annie Murphy (Alexis) steal the show every single scene they are in, especially Annie Murphy - special mention for the little squeals, facial expressions and gestures that do not seem exaggerated for someone of Alexis' upbringing and social standing, though they definitely would seem out of place in the real world.The story develops nicely and ends on a high that I wish many other sitcoms had adopted - yes I'm looking at you HIMYM creators. I just finished binge watching them on Netflix tonight and I'm happy to note that the initial interest I had in the show, after watching the first few episodes when they originally came out, the show kept me interested till the end.
Do give it a try, I'm sure you would binge watch it too."
153,Saw this on my Netflix suggested list and thought i would give it a go. After binge watching the whole 6 seasons i can honestly say it was the best thing i have watched in a long time. Great cast. Love David and Johnny ....brilliant....although cried on the last episode
154,"A showmanship on how comedy can be simple, subtle but yet sublime and powerful."
155,"This is by far one of the best shows I've ever watched. I don't enjoy comedies. But this is a fantastic, clean, fun comedy for the entire family. With a deep emotional twist to itIt is also such a feel good show. Laughed and cried at the same time soooo many timesEvery single character has been cast beautifully and have done justice to their role and deserve an award for it. But no one better than Catherine O'Hara. I cannot think of anyone who wouldn't absolutely love this show."
156,"This was in my queue forever. I started it a few months ago and recently finished the last episode ever *😭😭😭😭*I really loved this show. The characters are outrageous and you just grow to love everyone.It's So quotable and fun. I wish it Didn't end. I've rewatched it a few times even. I just love it.
I love all of the characters:
The way Catherine O'Hara plays Moira is superb... She has a crazy accent, interesting word choices, and loves to make it all about her. But deep Down (very deep) she is a softy and has touching moments that make her human. She reminds me of Beetlejuice in how she dresses. It's hystericalI adore David Rose! My boyfriend always jokes that I am David Rose hahahaI love that Johnny and Stevie became like father and daughter, as well as business partnersI love that Moira wears wigs every day and names them
I don't think I hate a single character.I love that Patrick sings to David. I cried
😭😭😭I will rewatch again at some point."
157,"Good comedies are rare, but this is definitely one of them"
158,"As a person who loves television programs with maybe too much passion (that keeps me in front of the t.v. way more than I should be) I must say that there is one show that stands out above all others; Schitt's Creek. You should watch this charming comedy (21 minute sitcom) show about family and acceptance. As a review stated, ""warm and good-hearted without being sappy or lacking edge in its humor"".
It has amazing talents such as Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara and others you will get to discover and love along the way. It just wrapped its 6th and final season last night. It truly is a social phenomenon. If you ever wanted to know me better, to know me is to know these characters because I just love and adore them. This show would be my choice of what to watch if I had to choose just one piece of entertainment for the rest of my life. Congrats to the cast, crew and writers for what they have created. It will live on in my heart as well as anyone else who watches. I can't say enough how much I love Daniel Levy and his character of David Rose."
159,"This show IS brilliant. Never seen another like it! All the characters are hilarious and so well developed.
Schitts Creek has a great balance of humour and touching moments. If you haven't seen it, please do! On Netflix!"
160,"This show is hilarious. It's become my ""comfort food"" show like Seinfeld, the Office, Parks and Rec, etc. At the end of the day, however, this is a show about family. Even the most outrageous characters in the most ridiculous situations are real people getting to know each other and grow fond of one another (much like the audience is!) Over the first five seasons each character has put themselves out there - faults, weaknesses and vulnerabilities along with their virtues and endearing quirks. Unlike a basic sitcom template these characters have been allowed to grow and learn and progress while still maintaining the qualities that went into their original character brief. I notice that the entire Levy family has been put to work either as actors or screenwriters, etc. I guess it's easy to make a show about family when you're already there!"
161,"I am obsessed with this show! As a sarcastic person myself, I enjoy the continuous witty sarcasm between the characters. I like how David and Alexis have evolved throughout the seasons. I think Alexis is adorable with her mannerisms and quips. I appreciate her style and how she is comfortable in her own skin. David is just ""cute as a button"", reference to the show and Patrick. I love the dynamics within the Rose family. The parents are stellar comedians and I remember them fondly from SCTV. I can't wait for the upcoming Christmas special and then Season 5!"
162,"Schitt's Creek brands itself a sitcom, but it's not funny enough to be great in that department. It's at its best when it gets serious, but those scenes are few and far between. One of my biggest criticisms is that there's not a whole lot of character growth for Moira. She's a very over-the-top, thinly-written character. I loved all the other characters, though. Rarely did this show slay me. It's not funny enough for me to ever stop and watch a rerun in syndication. There's so much range episode to episode. Some are boring, unfunny, and immediately forgettable. But others are really funny and, especially in the later seasons, there is some real beauty to it. Where the show excels is in the characters, not the jokes. The vast majority of my laughs weren't from punchlines, but from the quirky little habits of the actors. The way they use their hands, and their facial expressions, and the way they feed off each other. The best part of the show is its representation of LGBTQ characters, and the normalcy with which it paints them. It's never preachy, or political. It presents queer characters like perfectly normal people, who live and love and form beautiful relationships. It almost exists in a future world, where we're past the issues of today. It's so refreshing to see gay characters given room to grow without persecution and hatred."
163,Love this show! We had seen it win a number of Emmys and thought we'd check it out. What a gem! Most episodes are 'laugh out loud' funny. Others are sweet and surprising as character development is exquisite. We're almost finished with Season 3. It's a binge-watchers delight especially during the dreaded pandemic.
164,"If you decide to watch this show, please watch the whole series.I know a lot of people who hated these ""pretentious"" characters. If you don't like the comedy style, then that's ok, but if it's the characters, you really need to get to season 2 finale. Over the course of this series these characters change and evolve. The town characters are fun and diverse."
165,The first season started off slow but by season 2 I was hooked. By season 3 it became the best show I've seen in a very long time. Incredibly it keeps getting better right through the series finale. The cast is so talented and I fell in love with every single character even the smaller supporting roles. It reminds me of Parks and Recreation (another favorite) but with much more heart. I have rewatched several times and it gets better each time. Bonus it's the only show my family all agrees on. If you love great character comedy this show is one of the best - no surprise given the top talent in the cast. It's love and joy and kindness while being hilariously funny and what this world needs right now. Grateful to have this show to revisit for years to come.
166,"It's funny, it's sarcastic, it's everyday life of riches to not so rags situation. Never a mean word or ill treating or belittling anyone. They were awesome. I can watch it over and over again. The Roses were so good, specially David Rose and Alexis Rose. This 4 member family was all different from each other, yet were so together. The whole series is amazing acting by David Rose, he is a delight to watch and his cute good-looking partner, Patrick. I await their return and reunion."
167,This show had me crying from laughing so hard! It's the best comedy I've ever seen! My favorite for sure!
168,Thanks for joining our family during quarantine Schitt's Creek. We truly were happy to share our evenings with the show.
169,"I laugh out loud every show! I'm watching for the 2nd time. Great actors, great escapism."
170,I'd give this show a 10 but I just can't stand Catherine O'Hara character!!!! All her lines just annoy me and the way she speaks. Yuck!!!! Everyone else is amazing and very funny in this show.
171,"Honest to say this series is truly a master piece, most of all I'd praise Catherine O'Hara because she makes this series so spectacular, the comedy, the one liners. Moria's character is by far my favourite!"
172,Great Canadian show. Best since Corner Gas. Only qualm is Moira (Catherine O'hara) sounds like she has a speech impediment at times. Her hoity toity accent gets very annoying. On the other hand David is an absolutely hilarious character
173,"I did not enjoy watching the first two episodes at all.The only character that is even remotely good is the girl at the front desk. All of the others are over the top caricatures. As a Canadian, I find this show very disappointing, especially given that the CRTC basically censors what we can watch. I wanted to like the show, but the characters are so unlikable that I just couldn't bring myself to care what happens to them. Maybe it gets better in the third episode, but I can't bring myself to watch another.There is a 10 line minimum so ignore everything from here on out. Seriously, have they never heard of KISS: Keep it simple, stupid? Lengthy doesn't mean better. I basically disliked this show because the characters are so unlikeable; end of story."
174,"Just putting rich people into uncomfortable situations that rich people don't normally find themselves in does not make a show funny. There would have to be, I don't know, humor or something to make that happen. I thought for sure because of the cast and ratings that this wouldn't be so terrible. I even went against my gut and started to watch the second episode after the abysmal pilot. Seriously what is this? I am only reviewing this show because the ratings on IMDb are totally skewed and something's fishy here. There is no way this many people actually like this show--I just don't believe it. It's really stupid and unoriginal and the plot is as poorly written as the jokes. It's actually very difficult to watch and I can't believe I wasted more than 20 minutes on it."
175,"I am more than surprised to look this show up on IMDb.com and find that it is rated above 5 out of 10. I am astonished that it is rated 7.9. I mean..... how?! Who is actually watching this awful show and giving it almost an 80% rating? Who watches Schitt's Creek, a TV series built entirely on an excrement pun, and says to themselves ""this show is so funny it deserves a grade of A!"" This show is not the worst I've ever seen by far but it is definitely a below average show that is just plain not good.Catherine O'Hara, Eugene Levy and Chris Elliott are all A+ comedy actors in my books. But that doesn't mean this show is automatically good. I don't blame them at all for the fact that this show stinks. It's the fault of the writer(s) who have given them nothing good to do or say. Not one moment of one scene in one episode is believable or funny in the least. The show is built on lowbrow puns and predictable lowest common denominator jokes, given to pathetic, unlikable characters who range from one dimensional at best to offensive stereotypes at worst.The level of cleverness and hilarity never rises above the terrible pun title this show has been saddled with. I hate that my tax dollars get pumped into below average shows like this year after year.Worst of all is Dan Levy, who must be Eugene Levy's son because why else would he have been put on this show. His screechy overacting and hammy over the top delivery make me cringe every time he is on screen, and most especially every time he opens his mouth.He gets a 0/10, the writing gets 0/10, the rest of the supporting cast gets 2/10, the three great comedy actors get 7/10 and the show overall gets a 3/10 from me."
176,"I enjoyed Schitt's Creek for the first couple of seasons but I'm afraid it's run its creative course. It was really funny at first, and it was great to see legendary Canadian entertainers Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara again. However, the subject matter has really changed of late and to be honest, I just don't find it funny any more."
177,"Sad to say it but this truly is one of the worst TV series of all time. Of all time. Disappointing writing, jokes and acting and worst of all is Dan Levy's acting..... he is the worst!"
178,"I could only stomach about half of the first episode. Over acting, the children's fight scenes are grating and annoying instead of comedic as I think they intended, and the ""mayor"" was just annoying as well. I don't see this making a whole season. Stupid humor is what they seem to have tried for, but it came out as just stupid. I can't think of much more to say about this show, my point is made, but IMDb requires a full ten lines before they'll accept this review. Apparently that wasn't enough, so I'm just going to keep typing. These last three lines are idiocy, please ignore them. Holy balls, I've said what I wanted to say, let me post this damned review already, please."
179,I really enjoyed the first season of Schitt's Creek. I have always been a fan of Eugene Levy and I find the story fresh and funny. When the show ended I was looking forward to see where the writers were going to go with the story. This brings me to season 2. I watched the first episode and found it a bit lackluster in the funny department but the characters were true to form from season 1 and I anxiously awaited episode 2. I had about the same opinion and waited for the next episode. I'm up to episode 6 and I'm still disappointed. I'm wondering if any one else feels the show sort of fizzled out this season? I think there are a lot of different directions that the writers could take but it seems to me that it has become predictable and not all that funny. I'm not ready to call it quits so I'm going to hang in there and hope for the best. Just wondering if it is just me and I'm missing something. Has any body read anything about ratings this season?
180,"Do I like the show? No Do I get the show? I don't think so.Hence the 5 rating.It seems as though this show is evoking strong feelings in people, be it love or hatred. Personally, I hated the show. But I also feel like I don't get it.I think the show has chosen to employ some high brow humour and break clichés, which has left most of us confused as to the direction it's taking.I don't care.Okay, I do. I'm a bit disappointed. I was hoping for a good, funny, (and most importantly) Canadian TV show I can watch."
181,"Wow, you really need to dig down deep and go all the way back to page 1 of the reviews to see the genuine ones. The over-the-top positive reviews on the other four pages are so obviously plants presumably by friends of the cast and crew hoping to get a second season. They win; I hear it's coming back.Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara are largely wasted. None of the characters are particularly well-written. Why is the mayor's wife the most believable of any of the characters? And even that's thrown out the window by having her married to Chris Elliott who looks like an extra from ""Deliverance."" Chris Elliott is a funny guy; but having him look even worse than he did in ""Something About Mary"" yet married to the most normal woman in town doesn't make a lot of sense.Even the premise is never really explained. How does Johnny Rose ""own"" the town? What exactly does he own? It's mentioned in the first episode, but briefly. He ""bought"" the town as a joke for David's birthday. What exactly did he buy?The Mayor's son, Mutt, has the distinction of having the worst fake beard in the history of television. He looks like one of those Wooly Willy magnetic steel-shavings beard toys. Possible spoiler (?): David Rose was funnier when we all presumed he was just a pretentious gay guy. Throwing him together with the girl at the front desk, sexually if not romantically, again, makes no sense, even as a one-time fling.Alexis' boyfriend Ted is another head-scratcher. It's as if the writers were afraid to commit to him as a genuinely nice (if naive) guy that Alexis was just using. But soon they trotted out silly quirks in his personality that just weren't necessary. None of the characters seem to be written with any sense of consistency. Sadly, this extends to Catherine O'Hara's Moira as well. Some episodes she's crazy, others she's merely high-maintenance; others still she's relatively well-adjusted. Dan Levy should have taken a page from a certain 60s fish-out-of-water sitcom and made all of the townspeople consistently wacky, and played to his father's strengths: Reacting. It would be a much funnier show to have Eugene Levy be the one voice of sanity and normalcy in town, reacting to everyone else, much like Oliver Wendell Douglas did in ""Green Acres."""
182,"It's one of my new favorite shows binge watched it on Netflix, so excited for season 5"
183,"Almost nothing on TV is a 10 which should truly be kep in reserve for actual greatness. This show is awful! Other reviewers make stupid comments like ""its to subtle for the masses"" or ""if you don't get it then you just don't get"". Subtle? Are you kidding me? Yes, I get it! The theme and jokes are nothing new and are done poorly. Nothing is funny or entertaining about this show. Same character actors doing the same old roles they have always done."
184,"TV is finished for me. I am now confined to a handful of series - Billions, Better Call Saul, a stray mini series like The Night Manager, Happy Valley, Poldark, and most recently Sneaky Pete.That's it... there are no other shows worth watching. I was subjected to an episode of this tragedy while visiting a relative. I was embarrassed for veterans like O'Hara.All these sitcoms are aimed at juvenile tastes, partisan hacks and politically correct formula's for racial ""balance"".No thanks."
185,"I'm not too picky about what I watch. Even shows that are bad I usually still enjoy to a certain extent. This is absolutely the worst show I have ever seen.It's supposed to be a comedy but there's not one thing that's funny about it. You can see they sat around at the writers table and went ""Guys, that punchline is so funny!"" And it's not. None of the characters are likable. Even in shows like Its always Sunny, Seinfeld, or Arrested Development where they are truly terrible people, they still have an endearing quality to them. None of Schitt Creek's character have any quality that makes you feel one bit empathy for them. You just sit there wondering how this show was made. It's painful to watch and all these positive reviews goes to show how many people don't know what comedy is."
186,"There isn't one character that is likeable. Watched the first three episodes, just couldn't stand it. Reviews are completely overblown and just going along with the herd. If this is the kind of show everyone watches, it explains a lot."
187,"This tries to be like ""Arrested Development"" but never quite makes it. The acting is pretty dismal, with the actors merely delivering lines with the same predictability over and over, and using the same gestures and facial expressions. This all becomes really tiresome after a while. The editing is poor, and the continuity between scenes, abrupt! The son's character finally comes out round about Season 3 but development of that seems painfully slow. This seems to be a brand of Canadian humor but really doesn't fly globally. It's pretty average but a good watch to download from Netflix and watch on a long bus or train trip!"
188,"Once again CBC has proved it has the taste buds of a Slug. Shitt'$ Creek is a perfect title for this lump of Garbage.Where in the world did the bright (sic) person ever think that this story line had any reason to be thrust upon the the general public.Its not comedy, Comedy is to supposed to make you feel euphoric, happy, not grit your teeth and reach of the remote.True I watch the first episode, hey I even programmed my PVR to record every episode, but that was quickly changed after the start of the second half hour of stupidity. Its a shame that CBC has once again squandered it's allotment of taxpayer cash to produce a show that will die a slow and horrible death, at our expense.Laugh and the world laughs with you, watch Shitt'$ Creek and you need to get a life.Since I need to have more lines in the tirade before it will be excepted. Then ponder the following.Once upon a time in a land far away, shrouded in mist and fog. A TV Show producer, tying their best to out do the competition, resurrected every time worn cliché they could find and lump it together is some vain attempt to be funny. Fail. Please don't try again, cut your losses and take up basket weaving. Please"
189,"This was a massive surprise packet.
So funny well written and the best comedy on Netflix"
190,"I love the actors and the idea of the show but dear lord, it's boring. I don't know why I keep watching. I guess I'm hoping anything will happen...6 episodes later. 😳"
191,"Schitt's Creek is absolutely one of the worst shows I have ever seen. Not funny at all, terrible cast, even worse writing. The jokes are on the level that a 12 year old would like. I'm stunned that any network executive would even consider putting it on the air. Unbelievable how bad it is. I honestly don't understand what anybody with any level of intelligence sees in this show."
192,"Boring and overacted in a bad way.
Not my type of humors and probably not yours.
Levy junior role annoying . 
not many sets scenes.
so so cinematography.
overrated . should be a max 5."
193,"I am amazed, no, shocked that this pitiful excuse for a comedy lasted for 6 long, and no doubt, excruciating seasons. I have seen horror movies that were funnier than this disaster. I personally would prefer to rate this ""comedy"" a "" -10""."
194,"This show is so bad and unfunny on ever level I actually feel like I've been attacked or something. It's unbelievably insulting to me that my tax dollars are paying for this garbage to be made with a lot of that money going into the pockets of Dan Levy, the most annoying and untalented actor I've ever seen on TV ever, who obviously only has a TV show because he is Eugene Levy's son. It's shameful and it's a terrible show contrary to what these super suspicious glowing reviews all say about it and him. Truly an awful, insulting show."
195,"I don't buy these positive reviews because I've never met anyone in real life who has seen this show and says they actually liked it. Also I've seen this show myself and it is just plain not funny or good in any other way either come to think of it. The character of the son is also the worst, least funny, most annoying person I've ever seen in a TV show (Eugene Levy's real son which is I'm guessing is the only way he got cast in this)."
196,I love love LOVE Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy but this show is just garbage. Terrible writing and Levy's son are just garbage!
197,Dan Levy stinks. He is probably the worst person I have ever seen on TV in my life.
198,"I just watched part of the first episode of season 5 and I had to turn it off!
Such a disappointment because seasons 1-4 were hilarious - best sitcom ever! I highly recommend watching the first four seasons, then leave it at that."
199,I guess I just don't care for sitcoms much anymore. The acting is good the story is okay I just feel like the characters whine the entire time. I like the actors in this show I just don't recommend this show.
200,Schitt's creek is a really bad show. it is not funny at all and worst of all is dan levy his character is so annoying and he is garbage as an actor. eugene levy is wasted completely.
201,"This show is terrible. The writing is awful and even worse than that is the acting, particularly from the show's producer/creator/star and son of an actual star Dan Levy, who is supposed to be playing a teenager....Wait for real this hairy fug-faced dwarf is supposed to be a teenager? Yup....Dan Levy is so over the top he probably arrives on set every day inside a can of ham. All of his jokes are unoriginal and rely on flaming gayness. On top of the fact he lacks any talent as a performer and writer (if he actually writes for this show) he's also automatically dis-likable because of the simple fact he's done nothing, isn't remotely famous, but apparently was handed a TV series because of who his dad and his dad's friends are? With Canadian tax dollars funding this? What?The fish out of water thing has been done to death and done much better, including the ""rich person suddenly becomes poor"" variety. I mean even the remake of Overboard is a billion times better.One of the worst Canadian comedy series I have seen and I don't care what the positive reviewers here say, frankly I think it's obviously a lot of these are either purchased or written by homers of the show. Seriously it is in the conversation with Little Mosque, Trouble with Tracy, Package Deal, Double Exposure, XPM and other such stool samples.I get how it got to be on TV in the first place (nepotism) but how on earth did it stay on the air and why is this garbage on Netflix?"
202,"First of all, if you have a sense of humour and you have the ability to comprehend facial expressions in lieu of dialogue, then you're already half way there. This show is nothing short of genius. When I saw the first episode, I admit I was half watching it because, like others have said, we've seen the formula before. HOWEVER, I've been addicted to this show since episode 2 and have seen all the seasons at least 20 times or more. I absolutely love this show. There is ample character development, achieved in a very fun way that is respectful to the organic nature of each actor - so for those that say there is no character development, not sure what show you've been watching. Absolutely packed with the funnies. I love Johnny, Rolland, Alexis, David and Moira in this show. Stevie is great too."
203,"We enjoyed this show through season 3, but something changed beginning in season 4. The writing isn't as funny and we stopped watching after 3 episodes. Too bad, as it was a good show."
204,"I never watch boxed sets, ever. Maximum 4 episodes sets for me usually. However I saw this on the Emmys and watched one episode just to see what all the fuss was about. I was then hooked.I'm watching one or two episodes every day or so, as a treat!I'm up to end of season 2 and it's been, and is, such a blessing for me. I'm a mental health nurse working in the NHS in a crisis team and times are hard, very hard for my patients. This magnificent programme takes me away, just for a short while from this world. It's a gift. No masks, no social distancing, no evil Covid.It's superbly written, wonderfully acted with characters that I love and root for.I'll be a mess at the end of season 6 so will go slower to postpone it!I know it's 99% unlikely that any of the cast or crew read this but if, by some chance you do, THANK YOU! Thank you for creating something so outstanding that can never be replicated or repeated. It reminds me a little of 'Married With Children' but far better! You have brightened my life through your sheer talent and giftings. I unconsciously smile from the minute each episode starts.It's extremely funny, warm and just beautiful in so many ways.Kind regards, warmest wishes 😁"
205,"My favourite series ever! The first few episodes you're kind of wondering what am I watching. But then before you know it, you're absolutely addicted to it and cannot stop watching it.You end up falling in love with all the characters, their personalities, and the little weird town. There are episodes where you just can't help but shed a tear, and other times laughing out loud!My favourite characters are definitely David and Alexis! Love!"
206,"This show would be an 8/10 if it wasn't for Catherine O'Hara's character. I'm not sure if it's the way the character was written or the way she plays it, but it's unbearable. Dan and Eugene Levy keep the series worth watching."
207,A lot of hate. Must be a lot of miserable people out there. Its not perfect but very fun with a lot of heart. Daivid can me a little much sometimes but once you see them all grow you fall in love with the show. Its a grower not a shower. Dont be a sour puss. Give this show a chance.
208,"This series starts off great and only gets better. I've just finished season two and can't wait to see the rest.
The actors, the writing, wardrobe and sets are excellent!
It's super intelligent comedy, right up there with Fraser and Seinfeld, that never date and can be enjoyed over and over for years to come.
Big thanks to the Levy family and all concerned. Keep em coming..PLEASE!"
209,I like a lot of Eugene Levy and Chatherine O'Hara's work so I was looking forward to this series. I can't believe how un-funny this is. Major let down.
210,"First few seasons were great. This season they have managed to jump the shark on just about every episode. None of us laughed a single time in the Cabaret episode. I keep hoping it will get back to being funny and entertaining, but not holding my breath. Put a fork in it."
211,Ghastly on every level. To see two of my favorite actors in this catastrophe was truly depressing.
212,"This isn't a fake review!! This show is hilarious, fun, happy, and the cast are very cute! I binge watched all the episodes within 2 days!! I can't wait for season 5."
213,This show is terribly unfunny. I saw one user write that they haven't made it through a single episode without laughing. I didn't laugh during a single episode. After six or eight episodes I started to question what was wrong with me. Am I insane? Am I some kind of masochist? I had to stop inflicting self harm. I stopped watching and never looked back. Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara are two of the funniest people I've ever witnessed on film. Are they only doing this for the sake of Eugene's son? It's a shame that this show has tainted my memory of these two.
214,"I enjoyed the first few episodes of this show but it just became stale after a while . This show is very slow , and their aren't much characters involved . I had high hopes for this comedy show . I had to change it ,it almost out me to sleep . Nice character development but I just wished more was going on to keep my attention , it was unexciting and predictable ."
215,I have never written a review before but I had to for this. This is actually one of the funniest shows I have ever seen. It's Arrested Development but in some ways so much more. Character development is excellent. Comedic timing is on point. Anne Murphy and Dan Levy are amazing ...and Catherine and Eugene continue to be great together. I can't wait for season 5!
216,"I watched this show after a recommendation and was told it's laugh-out-loud funny. It's not. I watched all of season one and some of season two and it's only gotten a few chuckles out of me.It feels like Arrested Development but the writers are trying to make the characters likable. What made AD so funny was that you were entertained seeing the characters go through crap storm after crap storm and the humor was silly and goofy. The forced sympathy on Schitts just makes for shallow and predictable plots. The sarcastic tone of the comedy gets really old really fast.The acting is great. The leads really sell these horrible characters, but the writing is bland and often inconsistent. Find another show to binge watch."
217,"This is simply the worst TV show imaginable.Contrary to several of the reviews here, none of the principal actors are ""comedy legends"". The two older ones had minor roles in forgettable films. The younger two have no track record at all.The actor playing the father is wooden and unfunny. The mother is grotesque. The son is an insult to all gay people, and only has a part because of the father. The daughter thinks acting is making faces which are unrelated to her emotions.I seriously overrated the show by giving it one star, but I had no choice. There really should be an option for zero stars ... and even that would be generous."
218,"That's right. Not just the worst film , worst script, worst acting, but actually the worst 'thing' to exist ever , anywhere. I am not going to waste any more time or effort. I've already wasted 2 minutes typing this. Thank God for the off button. I was so close to smashing my tv into tiny pieces. I relented though. Avoid, please , for your own safety."
219,"I have to say, this show is one obnoxious little comedy show. I started watching after it "" swept"" the Emmys this year. But I was disappointed. I am in 4th season and I did not find it funny. So much boring. And whatsup with the hands of character. I mean waving hands littrely every scene. The characters are very off-putting. I do not know how it got all the comedy awards this year. I wonder has the standards of comedy has fallen this year. A definite no no"
220,Everyone is perfect but Dan Levi is hilarious. Didn't expect much from the show but was pleasantly surprised.
221,"Due to some medical issues I've been down in the dumps the past month. The one thing that brings me back up is Schitt'$ Creek. Eugene Levy is classic, as is Catherine O'Hara and the rest of the cast. Getting Chris Elliot involved is brilliant.Very funny stuff. I'm in season 2 - and doling it out to myself slowly.. but it really helps bring cheer to me."
222,Sorry...gave it a try...read the great reviews and awards....just found it very amateurish! Catherine O is good....but Dan Levy is not...... it's like watching a game of charades with your friends! Just over zealous zany characters with cheap joke's!
223,"Catherine O'Hara as Moira was dazzling! The outfits were top notch. Eugene Levy was his normal, comedic genius. The David character was good in the first two seasons, but I could barely get through the last two seasons. David is a caricature of a real person. His face is constantly contorted. The writing was crisp and funny in the beginning, but ends up so far away by the end. Watch two seasons then save yourself and turn it off."
224,"The first three seasons were really good. I don't think I'd heard of Catherine O'Hara before but she was the standout for me.Stumbled across this via a friend's instagram story and so glad I did, however a evident lack of diversity in respect to the main storylines."
225,"Quite simply the funniest, most heart warming programme I have ever seen. The characters become like family and I'm going to miss them a lot now the show has ended."
226,The characters aren't for everyone but if you understand and appreciate them then this is spectacular! From episode 1 to the last episode there isn't one episode that fails! Do yourself a favor and watch this!!
227,I grew to love every single character on this show. One of the best comedy shows.
228,Not one of those shows which are dragged on unnecessarily. Loved the subtle humour and interrelation of different emotions
229,"Just came across this by accident and I will say this show is amazing, so funny and touching and so much character development"
230,"Got to catch up with this comedy gem in this quarantine times. I avoided it coz the name of the show literally put me off. I was like WTF kinda name is that? But after watching it, I felt the wordplay on the name was genius. Anyway, in Moira's accent, ""it's surprisingly wonderfuuulll"". I am glad that it's a comedy show & without a laughter track in the background, this show never got bored. I usually prefer laughing track in the background for comedy shows. Each and every character bought life on the show. This is really a very underrated comedy show. It deserved to get much attention similar to Modern Family. But the character Moira was the heart of the show for me. My only one negative complain is that they should have given more screen time to Dustin Milligan coz he deserves better. Well, anyway it's still 10/10 for me."
231,"I've watched this series several times. It is definitely one of my favorite series created ever. Perfect cast, beautiful storyline, absolutely hilarious, and unique from any other show I have seen regardless if the riches to rags thing has been told before. Watching the show was not only hysterical, but the growth of the characters, the relationships, etc is inspiring to see. The inclusive cast was fantastic. The LGBTQ story wasn't broadcasted as the highlight, which was refreshing. They weren't trying to say anything like ""WE MATTER TOO!!!"" they said it WITHOUT having to be too aggressive about it. It's hard to describe, but they effortlessly show how loving everyone should be of every orientation, race, gender, etc. The relationships are all absolutely beautiful. The equality shown in this show is unbelievably amazing. The humor, growth, story, characters, etc are so amazing in this show are only a few of the reasons you should watch it. Brilliant show. Sad it ended after 6 seasons!"
232,"Started watching in February and finished Schitt's Creek at the beginning of March and I can admit I've been watching short clips on Youtube ever since then. Sitcoms are bound to have bad seasons or AT LEAST bad episodes but Dan Levy was smart enough to wrap up the story when it finished. No filler seasons, nothing. Just pure comedy and storyline that'll make you feel like a part of Rose household. Characters are brilliantly written and the development is flawlessly executed. Will always be my favorite show and hate to say it but one of the mose underrated."
233,"Clever, funny and very entertaining. I loved this series more and more. Love the romance between David and Patrick. Really looking forward to season 6!"
234,"I really enjoyed the first four seasons. I'm watching season five but it is a chore. Season five is a meandering mess. David's character is exactly the same as it was in the first show. The two romances are over done and boring. It seems like the whole cast is phoning it in. Plot lines start and get abandoned. Very few laughs. It's like watching a soap opera.
I'm being harsh because the contrast between this season and the last four is stark.
I'm hoping this cast and the writers get back to the high standards of this quirky, enjoyable and funny series. Otherwise the talent of Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, and Chris Elliot will have been wasted."
235,"First 2-3 seasons were quite funny and interesting but then it went down the hill. I rated it 9 stars at first but now 4 stars is very generous and 4 stars only because of Alexis Rose character. Annie Murphy is perfect and so funny in this role.
Right now it's all about David Rose and his boyfriend. Meh..."
236,"Awesome, hilarious, great acting, great writing...for awhile.Then it got into social issues by Season 5 and just stopped being funny. No problem with LGBTQ but its way overdone with Patrick and David, just not funny at all and ""Patrick"" had the same sh**eaten grin on his face every episode, needs some acting lessons.Disappointed the way the show took a turn towards just another boring tv show."
237,"Quite simply the best show that has ever aired. I have never loved a show more than I have this. It's a breathtaking piece of TV. It's important, it's never been more prevalent now and it's so utterly easy to watch. This show is from start to finish incredible. Never before have I seen a show with such heart and importance. I will love this show forever, Honestly I have never in my life seen anything more genius in writing and performance. 100/100 perfect"
238,"I haven't enjoy a sitcom for long time , smart but funny story , unusual characters , great dialogues , what a pleasure , and the cast is outstanding leaded by storm like Kathrine O ' Hara. Bravo ."
239,"I loved this series and so I am here to spread the word of mouth. A beautiful series with lots of laughs and lessons. This was my first series which made me understand/visualize love between two boys. The series has pain, sorries, complains, arguments, drama, selfish characters and at the end realization that we all are humans. Thank you for writing such a beautiful story."
240,"Never thought I'd like this show, but it's amazing."
241,"When I started this series I had some doubt whether it is going to be that good or not. But as the seasons passed this show started to grow on me. There's not even a single character from the show who is unlikable. every single character is likable and have it's own charm.
I loved my time in Schitt's Creek and I'm sure you'll too."
242,I have very much enjoyed each and every episode of this show. It's light and breezy. The casting is so good can't imagine anyone else playing those characters. Daniel Levy's role is just perfect and my favourite character.
243,"Dan levy is electric! Great show. Love the whole family dynamic, the cast is perfect 👌"
244,"Haven't seen a show this refreshing, neat and light headed in the longest time. Every character has its own charm and the actors have done absolute justice to the scripts."
245,"The show has been best comedy show for me so far, it makes me laugh, cry, feel love Every charactor has a particular impression, especially David Rose, he is the show I couldn't love this show more Thank you for giving me and the world such a meaningful and lovely show"
246,"Once you overcome your initial perceptions of what this show is going to be it gets its hooks deeply into you and is a funny and deeply moving series with characters you grow to really love.
It's about friendship and family values and how good begets good. It's about self improvement and how materialism means nothing without others in your life to share the good and bad times. It has a great LGBT message with a very natural gay love story without any angst or drama.
It was quite a few episodes until you realise the show has turned into something else.
It's not just a comedy - it's more.
Give it a chance and it will reward you..."
247,"Before watching it I came here to read the reviews and someone wrote that after a few episodes you will get hooked. This is also my advice - do not give up on the show after the first two or so episodes!I absolutely loved it! Watched it from beginning to the end two times in a row. You can laugh and cry. The characters are amazingly written and the acting is spot on.It just gives you a warm feeling!
Watch it!"
248,This is one of my best shows ever! Its so sad that it had to come into an end ;( .. I really wish there could be at least one more season! ;(
249,"A funny, feel good that shows family unity, sibling support, quirky fashion sense, an array of characters, hilarious accents and an unique storyline. Bravo!"
250,Schitt's Creek handles difficult personal issues better than any sitcom. Very well done! Very funny memorable characters!
251,"Long time hearing about this show, 1st time viewer. Really enjoyed it & found it hilarious. The amusing may have a little to do with the current climate, yet I believe I would find this funny & enjoyable if not."
252,"#SchittsCreek was recommended to me by friend's. I watched and fell in love with each and every episode.
David is an absolute joy! Alexis one could only say is a funny, hot mess. Johnny and Moira, suited perfectly!!! Stevie, Patrick and Ted, wonderful gems to this ensemble cast.Watch this show."
253,"I initially struggled to get into it more than the rest of my family, but once addicted, I was truly addicted! It was incredibly well written and the characters showed such beautiful progression from the start to the end of the show, with so much growth and independent development and not a dull moment. Alexis (Annie Murphy) had such hilarious and consistent mannerisms and, in my opinion, grew the most as a character to become truly loveable. David (Dan Levy) and Patrick (Noah Reid) are now my favourite TV couple and beautifully portray an LGBT+ relationship, and the moments between them were 'simply the best', completely ship it and they balanced each other wonderfully. I love how David opened himself up and Patrick understood him perfectly and they pushed their boundaries for each other. Moira (Catherine O'Hara) and Johnny (Eugene Levy) had a great dynamic as a couple. Johnny's feelings of responsibility as the father and husband were subtly communicated in a lovely way and Moira's insanity was hilarious - especially 'bébé'! Stevie (Emily Hampshire) was fab and perfectly complemented David, and later Patrick too, and was a lovely friendship to watch develop. Overall I love and recommend the show, it took me a while to love it, but I'm now sad that we've finished and will be watching again very soon!"
254,"The Rose family moves from the big city to Schitt's Creek, a podunk town in the middle of nowhere. Oh wait, this sounds familiar. This is a remake of the Green Acres series from the 1960s! it's almost like they ripped it off! Johnny Rose is Oliver Wendell Douglas. They both wore suits all the time!Moira Rose is Lisa Douglas. They both wears fancy dresses and speak with an accent!David Rose is Eb. The crazy son!Alexis Rose is Arnold the Pig. Alexis does an amazing imitation of a rabbit with the way she holds her hands!Roland Schitt is Mr. Haney. Both crooked and dense as lead!Both families live in ramshackle homes. Both have crazy characters. Both eventually learn how those other characters are great people too."
255,"Schitt's Creek had me from the moment the door rings. This quirky comedy is very well written. The characters are represented perfectly by each actor. Somehow they are able to pull off the awkwardness of parents and children that do not have a relationship at all.
Daniel Levy, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'hare, and Annie Murphy are absolutely AMAZING"
256,"I love this show, it's everything most of us want for a funny heartwarming show. It reminds me of
""Hart Of Dixie."" I just wish the show had more seasons, David is my favorite."
257,"I've watched this from the beginning and I'm sorry it's ending after this season. I'm politically conservative, but open minded. I do appreciate a good laugh, and Schitt's Creek delivers. Moira and Johnny are the best."
258,Everything and I mean everything about this show is amazing. Such a good laugh.
259,"I just love this show. The characters, the humour, are all so enjoyable. Can't get enough of it, and each episode is way too short."
260,"A show with simple premise that grows with every season. Season 5 is highly emotional, especially with anything Dan Levy does."
261,"My husband and I love this show! My sister suggested it and we are at the 4th season and need, not want, more! There is a 5th season but not on Netflix, please please please"
262,Daaaay-vid! Love this show and wish there were a dozen seasons.
263,"This was released five years ago on a minor network. Now, it's on Netflix and it's better than any fluff comedy released by Netflix or HBO. The casting is superb. Eugene and Dan Levy are great, but Dan Levy steals every scene. Everyone's having a good time, and so are the viewers. If you're in the mood for a light dysfunctional sitcom, this is a great pic!"
264,"Hands down one of the most undeniably hilarious short show comedies ever written. Every episode had me laughing out loud, not figuratively, literally laughing out loud. Every character is perfectly casted."
265,"I've heard nothing but great things about ""Schitt's Creek"" for years but still put it off for some reason. I finally gave in & watched it and absolutely loved it. It's just flat out funny, nothing more to say than that. Give it a chance and I promise you'll like it!"
266,A family loses all their money and has to move to Schitt's Creek a town they once bought as a joke. While I don't think the show is comedy genius it's good for laughs and is light entertainment. Most episodes are only around 20 minutes long so it doesn't feel like the shows drag. My favorite character is the mom played by Catherine O'Hara.
267,"Binge watched entire series. Here's the deal....if you don't watch this show, you should just not exist and just simply wonder what your life is missing. The BEST written, produced, and overall show with a cast that was impeccably cast. Well done Dan Levy. You sir, are my Mariah Carey."
268,"It is lovely. I love the stories, the characters. I love everything about it. Its basically an amazing hug in the form of a TV show. Watch, you will cry happy tears for 6 seasons."
269,"Such a witty show, full of dry humour. Starts off slow but then it really grows on you. Love the representation of the LGBTQIA community, its so normalised as it should be. The cast cannot get any better, love them the most!"
270,"I started watching this show and I couldn't stop. I literally finished all 6 seasons in less than a week.
I love this show so much and all the characters.
You guys did an awesome job!"
271,Can't even put in words how great this show is. We watched all seasons in about 2 weeks. Definately in my top 5 lists for comedy shows.
272,"I decided to try season 1 on Netflix, and now have been on a binge! So funny & over the top, yet heartfelt! Love how the family slowly starts to discover each other (and themselves!), during their stay in Schitts Creek. When they arrive, they think that the town is full of ""weirdos"", but soon find out that THEY fit right in! It is so much fun following the residents through the ups, downs, and manic moods of life and trying to find and fit in to their ""new"" life. So many laughs!!"
273,"Thank you Schitt's Creek for providing an intelligent, moody- and brave comedy for us! The characters are incredibly interesting- their elements unravel and expound as the seasons go on. I laugh with it, and I cry too- so well done. The actors and actresses are top notch- I'll anticipate (with great hope!) that seasons will extend beyond 2020... Ok? Ok? Ok!!!!! So keep on writing.... we need you!"
274,Catherine O'hara is just so perfect! So perfect!!! That is all!!
275,"At first glance, I didn't quite warm up to the comedic style of this show. Being a fan of Friends, I like sarcastic humor, that's the one for me.But everything changed because I absolutely adore the easy going, warm, lovely atmosphere that this town has!! Everyone constantly collaborating on some project, people being friendly and helpful all the time - Dan Levy has created this atmosphere, this low burning and warm energy that is impossible to replicate anywhere else.I love the LGBT thing for NOT being a THING. I love that. It doesnt need to be explained or justified or argumented, it just is and that's fine.So while I appreciate it a lot (!!!) for what it is, I gave it a 7 for being a good show, solid watch, and I enjoyed it thoroughly but I can't help feeling there's something missing. I can't quite put my finger on it. Is it the storylines? Is it the character development? I don't know. It may be the fact that with the set being small and always repetitive - the hotel, Twyla s Cafe, the store, the Town Hall etc. it just feels at times like a set, not a real town. Also no people walking down the streets feels odd...But overall, great watch, relaxing, friendly and warm."
276,I didn't laugh at all through season 1 & 2 I was going to give up but from 3 onwards I really enjoyed it so stick with it.
277,"An amazing ride of joy, laughter, emotions which makes your day for sure."
278,"A rich man suddenly went bankrupt, forced to live in a small town where everyone knew anyone. From the beginning of the idea of how to get rid of these ""countrypeople"", to later gradually integrated and even the first time to explore the love between the family, the mother became a town councillor, father became a motel operator and cleaner, the son opened the town's first ""fashion shop"" also sell leather, The 30-year-old's daughter finished high school and even went to college. There is love and tangled family, there is laughter and teardrops of a play."

280,"Truly special! The small town characters and their quirks reminded me of the people of Stars Hallow in Gilmore Girls! The Rose Family is so very special. Despite their shallow beginnings, they prove themselves to be good people who make you laugh out loud every episode. Moira is over the top funny, Johnny is so kind & positive, Alexis is adorable, and David has the best facial expressions and one liners! So fun to watch!"
281,"A perfect show. Filled with moments that will make you laugh, make you cry, warm your heart and leave you happier than you were before you watched it"
282,I was a huge fan and watched over and over again. But the last 2 episodes about David's love life has totally turned me off. I could understand a little but when it takes over half the show it becomes not funny I feel very sad because I looked forward to seeing this show and turned my friends on to it. I will miss the humor.
283,I tried....i really really tried to give this show a chance...but i don't see all the yhpe and how this got so many Emmy's. It's NOT that funny....Ohara is hard to look at and watch....E Levy too. And the Gay Johnny Gilecki is annoying. Just my opinion. Next !
284,Chris Elliott is repulsive and disgusting in every roll he plays. He ruins all movies and shows.
285,"This is a show about rich pretentious family who lose everything except what they can pack up in suitcases. It is funny because the situation that this comedy is about, is them trying to acclimate and assimilate into an unknown way of life. It's funny because it's about rich people learning to be poor. It's very funny and entertaining at first, but then they start to establish themselves. They begin to make thousands of dollars, have jobs and are on the town council. Once this happens, there is nothing to watch. It no longer is funny, so they try to make more dramatic episodes to compensate for it."
286,"How this very average "" comedy "" won any awards is beyond me."
287,How does any adult find this series humorous? It's forced and lame. Bad acting. Maybe kids think it's funny. The actors appear to be reading the script for the first time. Really bad.
288,"First season starts out as an Arrested Development clone, rich family out of touch with regular people loses everything.By season 4 though, it's Gilmore Girls with small town love interests."
289,I love Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara bit the show is really silly. Stopped watching after the 2nd one.
290,"This series is infectious. Brilliant writing and acting. Canadian is a bonus!
Well done cast/writers.
If you don't get it ... frankly you're missing the 'gene' ."
291,"First, congratulations to the Levy Family (read the credits carefully) and the entire cast and crew. If you liked Seinfeld you will ""get"" this show! I have watched the first four episodes and it only gets better. Eugene Levy, as always, is perfect. Catherine O'Hara as the neurotic Mom, again, perfect. The two kids, Daniel Levy and Annie Murphy, epitomize spoiled rich kids. The ""townies"" are all great but I want to mention two in particular (again, I am only on episode 4): Chris Elliott (Mayor Schitt), enough said and Emily Hampshire (Stevie Budd, motel clerk) OUTSTANDING! Geez, even the bit part players are perfect. Check out the scene in S1 E4 when David is training as a bag boy at the grocery store. IMHO anyone who rates this below a 10 does not have a sense of humor!"
292,"This isn't your run of the mill comedy! I have never seen such a great cast that every one of them is awesome. It's very easy, funny, charming, you'll be glad u started watching by the first episode, and by the end of series, you'll heart will be very very warm! Watch it!"
293,"I discovered Schitt's Creek right when quarantine began and it is getting me through my days. I happy cry just about every other episode. A show that celebrates love and all of its amazing-ness. Every single character is lovable, all the storylines are positive, and oh yeah did I mention it's HILARIOUS!? It took a few episodes to get going but once you're hooked every episode gets better and better, just like the seasons do. I wish it never had to end but on the bright side the finale was perfection"
294,"Binge-watching this series on Netflix in late 2019.
I could watch Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara pull faces for 22 minutes each week and live happily ever after. Toss in Chris Elliott, whose sarcastic shtick is reminiscent of his days on Late Night With David Letterman, and I laughed out loud a lot in the first couple of seasons.
There are also excellent supporting performances from the mayor's dignified wife, played by Jennifer Robertson. the motel owner played by Emily Hampshire (who Canooks will remember as Alan Roy's spoiled daughter in Made In Canada), and many others.
The Rose ''children"" I can take or leave.Annie Murphy plays the daughter well but the writers run out of things for her to do after she goes from one town stud to the next. She deserves better writing. The son is played by series creator Daniel Levy, who is funnier when he's playing ''sarcastic, s3xually ambiguous man in decidedly non-gay setting,"" but gets on my nerves when, roughly about Season 3, the town seems to be overflowing with gay men and David pretty much becomes the central character in an LGBBQWERTY-affirmative action show. After a while I start to feel like I'm watching the sitcom version of the Rainbow parade.
If his show had built on its very strong first 2 seasons and given Chris Elliott more to do, with the focus remaining on the Rose and the Schitts, this could have been an all-time Canadian comedy classic. However, much like when Arrested Development veered away from the parents and their adult sons to focus on the freckle-faced grand-daughter and the doofus grandson, Schitts Creek is a lot less funny when the kids are on the screen. It's more like a Very Special After School Special that I started to resent watching because it was hammering home A BIG MESSAGE.
But by all means, watching those first two seasons. They are genuinely hilarious."
295,This show cannot be surpassed. Never disappointed in any episode. Keep it going. Love love love you all
296,This show is so funny! I love it. I love the actors.
297,"I love this show. The characters are the best part, it's a show about love and acceptance in all of its forms.. family friends partners yourself. Somebody has commented about having to suspend belief because it's unrealistic. For me that's a real positive.I think David is a brilliant character, but I really like them all. I can't wait for series 5 and 6. If you like dry sarcastic humour and character led stories then please watch this! Just brilliant!"
298,"Love this season of schitt's creek, as I did all others. The growth, the embracing of where they are, and seeing guys in love as normal is such a breathe of fresh air. fun, conscious, relevant. Love it."
299,"Beautifully written, definitely one of the best shows around. Amazing with how little the show's creators made so much, everything's spot-on here in Schiit's Creek. Season 4 is even getting quite a bit emotional... love it."
300,This show is hysterical. Binge-worthy for sure! I've watched 3 seasons in a week. I can't stop watching. Love the Levys and all the talented actors. WATCH IT!!
301,"Dumb, couldnt make it past the first 10 minutes, i really did not enjoy this"
302,"The first few episodes showcase the potential this show had to be great! The cast for the most part is fantastic. Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara are superb together and are the backbone of the series. Annie Murphy is a joy to watch and her character is annoyingly very funny and Chris Elliott is always entertaining.The problem with the show is the writing. The episodes are very predictable and hard to watch at times due to them being catered more towards the lgbtq community. One minute you're chuckling at some of the gags and enjoying the chemistry between certain actors, next you're feeling forced into watching a teen relationship drama with actors who are closer to 40 with campy secondary storylines that would be better suited to episodes of Glee. Also, For such a tiny town there sure seems to be a lot of queer people.. I guess that's just a coincidence though, not just lazy writing..By far the worst thing about this series is the ""actor"" Dan Levy. I had never heard of him before watching Schitt's Creek and it's safe to say I will not be watching anything with him in it again. His attempt at acting is cringeworthy and irritating to say the least. Clearly only in the show due to being Eugene Levy's son.5/10 for me. Could've been so much better. Also, once again we're seeing a show that would've been better ending on a high note after 2-3 seasons. Instead it looks like they're doing the typical American tv thing and dragging it out until it's truly milked. After all, more is more.. right?"
303,This show is just plain terrible. No character is relatable. Not funny. Every episode ends abruptly and unsatisfactory. I do not understand what people like here.
304,"I I read an article on NPR mentioning the renewal of season six of this show; that was the first time I heard of it. I binge watched it on Netflix and I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of it. It's refreshing, hilarious, whimsical and kind of deep (at least for me). I look forward to watching more of this show!HA"
305,"Goes downhill quite fast after season 1.
Stopped watching middle of season 3.
Stops being comedy and becomes male on male relationship drama"
306,"All the characters are extremely grating, the character development is pedantic. This show trys to be funny but it really just misses the mark for me.Parks and Rec or the Office this is not"
307,Atherine O'Hara is no doubt the stand out in this and by contrast Dan Levy is pretty terrible.. I got to a point where I had to skip his scenes.
308,"Love this season of schitt's creek, as I did all others. The growth, the embracing of where they are, and seeing guys in love as normal is such a breathe of fresh air. fun, conscious, relevant. Love it."
309,"As a fan of SCTV I was wary to watch Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara reunite for a Sitcom, especially with his son being a lead in the cast. Surprised to see Daniel Levy is actually ""the straw that stirs the drink!"" It is smart and amusing as we watch how shallow a modern millennium family can truly be. Sadly we can relate many of the Schitt'$ family interactions to acquaintances and our own families. Bonus... Canadian setting, unforced humour, subtle nuances unlike the title and of course Chris Elliot. I can still remember him on David Letterman in the early days. After five episodes it seems that I have been drawn in! Look forward to seeing the present characters grow and new ones yet to be introduced."
310,"I look to be in the minority here, but we watched the first three episodes and nothing funny happened. Not even a little. We bailed."
311,"When I look back on great shows like ""Fraiser"" I am reminded once again the the only thing that lasts is great writing!
Fraiser had that in spades from the first episode to the very last...for eleven years!!!
And wow...Breaking Bad...another top notch show and should be taught to future writers on how its done...if they still exist.
Schitt's Creek is not that. Major hits and misses on so many episodes and it was obvious they were running out of ideas by season 4. Sure there are some laughs but I have seen it before. I only watched it to see O'hara and Levy anyway.
I could give tons of examples why this show wasn't the crown jewel so many think it is but there are enough reviews on this thread to cover that.
SC doesn't have the legs of great shows of the past and will most likely be forgotten in reruns."
312,"Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara have co-starred in a couple of Christopher Guest's mockumentaries, always doing a great job. They now get to star on a TV series. ""Schitt's Creek"" casts them as a rich couple (with Dan Levy and Annie Murphy as their children) who suddenly lose everything and have to move to a podunk town that they purchased, forcing them to learn the ways of the hoi polloi. I think that this is the first Canadian series that I've watched consistently, and I love it. You're sure to love it also. Definitely check it out."
313,"I adore Moira's vocabulary. It is splendid and bombilating. Her outfits are angelic.I love David's character that titillates me.I love Al ex us' for always beeing glee riden and a little bedeviled while also being shallow.Otherwise, the show is on point. One of the bestestestest so far."
314,"Brilliantly written, superb acting, this show really hits all of the high notes. Gone is pining for the past and they've settled into the town with their formerly annoying, and now super lovable characters. The original cast are super funny; the new characters are fresh and endearing. I love this show!!"
315,"Show Started out great, a fish out of water story with memorable characters played by a seasoned cast. Eugene Levy is always fun to watch. The problem is the whole story changed from how this once rich New York City family cope with losing all their wealth and surviving in a quirky small town (COMEDY) to the David and Patrick LGBT Social Issues agenda pushing (DRAMA)... And well I just didn't care for some reason, found the plot change annoying. I'm sure the Gay community loved this but Eugene Levy fans were left on sideline wondering, ""what happened""."
316,Literally one of the funniest tv shows I've seen in quite some time. It's a great show to watch especially when your short on time. Definitely a must see.
317,"The first season was a little slow and the laughs were few and too far between. But I found the family characters quite endearing. I am a huge fan of Catherine O'Hara from Best in Show etc. The family grew on me and while some might think the character of David is too much I think he's a perfect fit and enriches the show, perfectly matched with his sister. Starting in the second season the Rose family shows more humility and humanity while the humor becomes smarter and the laughs and giggles are way more frequent!Love it!"
318,She is left without direction. Her arc felt incomplete. Was a great show up until they break her up with Ted and replace that meaningful relationship with absolutely nothing. Dan Levy made the last season all about himself and ignored Alexis. It's his show - he can do what he wants. But they really did her character a great injustice by leaving her behind while the rest of her family sees personal success and exciting change.Otherwise fun show. But ending should leave true fans unsatisfied.
319,"The Levy's created the best quasi adult comedy series I have ever been addicted to. Rarely have I been so interested in watching and re- watching any show. I purchased all seasons to date.
I truly hope they will develop a new show. The intelligence it took to keep me overly interested was invaluable to those of us who actually live some of the situations they depict. Truly great cast of artists."
320,"Typically I don't enjoy comedy series but this , I enjoy! I find myself laughing out loud and it surprises me every time. The acting and characters are exceptional. I am on season 4, I hope there are more seasons."
321,"As big a fan as I am of Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara-- geniuses both-- I must confess that this series' name was rather offputting. But it tuned out to be quirky, and delightful. And more: in a series where most of the major characters could easily have degenerated into caricatures (and in a depressingly large proportion of sitcoms, they do), almost all the characters, even the most outrageous or extreme (in particular Moira, Alexis, and David,) have all grown and developed and blossomed into three-dimensional human beings: and human beings we would want to know for real. In short, this series has developed into a veritable gem, where humor and satire are leavened and enriched by real human sentiment and complexity. Each of the five completed seasons has gotten better and better. The love interests of Alexis and David (especially that of David, Patrick) are equally splendid. All these characters, despite totally human flaws, show a growth and compassion that is at times most moving: culminating in Season Five's memorable climax with David and Patrick's engagement: we rejoice with them, and when Moira hears about the shelving of her movie, we are moved by her pain. I am overjoyed it will be coming back for a sixth season: but was distressed on reading that that sixth season will be the last: I would love another 10 or 20 seasons! Kudos-- and gratitude -- to all involved in with this unique and wonderful show."
322,This show is so dull and boring. I was expecting better constant the cast is good. Definitely not bingeworthy.
323,"One reviewer wrote this: 'A number of new, very positive reviews of this show have appeared within the last week, all with virtually unanimous positive ""helpful"" scores. Many of these reviews are from accounts that have just been created. Is someone from the production company stuffing the ballot box? I hope IMDb examines these.'I just created this account (and I am just a regular Canadian girl) so that I could review this show because of the above comment. Perhaps there are people more intelligent than ""that guy"" out there who truly understand and appreciate this show and THAT is why there are so many positive reviews being added to this site! If you don't have a good well rounded sense of humour - don't watch the show. End of story.For those that can appreciate GOOD humour - you know, the kind you have to think about (not just physical humour) - then this is a good show for you. I find this show incredibly smart and witty. You have to listen to the script to catch all of the well written jokes - they aren't always obvious, in your face jokes. I think that's why there are bad reviews - those people just can't use their brains.Also, Dan Levy is absolutely brilliant in this role - I have no idea why he is getting so much flack in the bad reviews (probably from people that can't handle more feminine men I suppose)! He is an incredible actor! Overall - this show is fantastic and I really hope that more people can see the potential in it. I hope it sticks around - I know a lot of good shows get cancelled because people don't give them a chance. This one is worth it! Probably my new favourite show! :)"
324,"I have to admit that my first assumption when I read the cast list and had gotten an idea about the scenario, I was more than sceptical. I hate flat comedies with cheap gags and hollow characters that only function for delivering those. But almost in the same way, as I almost misjudged GROUND FLOOR, I was wrong about SCHITTS CREEK ! I have found that all it takes for me to like a show, is getting to know most of the important characters enough to see them more or less threedimensional in a way, and to like them at least a bit, even to the point where you could identify yourself with some of them. The setup is not really highly original, but it always offers possibilities. Fish out of water style. The question is, what can you do with it. Is the show silly at times ? Yes, but is it annoying ? Only when the mayor is given too much to do, I'll admit. But SCHITTS CREEK totally wins me over with the four main characters themselves. They are great. Stonefaced deliverances of very often brilliant sarcastic humor, believable but also funny interactions. And the best: At some point you really start to like these people, with all their faults and messy ideas. I just enjoy it. Give it a chance, no really, just do !"
325,"This show had terrible reviews and then all of a sudden tons of glowing ratings and reviews popped up overnight from accounts who all seemed to sign up just to review this show at the same time? Give me a break.Unfortunately it worked and this show kept coming back. Dan Levy is the worst actor I've ever seen on TV. Even with Catherine O'Hara, Eugene Levy and Chris Elliott who are three of my fave all time comedy performers the flimsy premise and terrible writing and again Dan Levy all drag this show down to the point where it is almost unwatchable.I'm glad it's ending and our tax dollars will no longer be siphoned into the pockets of the people making this unfunny show. Hopefully the real stars of this show will go on to make many more, and much better, shows in the future.2 stars. I've seen worse."
326,"I have to amend my earlier review saying this show is garbage. I originally said it was so bad I continued watching just to see how bad it can get. The first few episodes the bathroom humor was too much and the main characters, aside from Eugene Levy, all seemed unlikeable. Around the end of the first season and early second season, the show finds its groove and becomes fun. The through line of what the family is going to do becomes increasingly interesting and the actors grow into their parts and the writing more focused."
327,"I definitely recommend the show, very funny only thing is I wish the episodes were longer."
328,"I accidently stumbled across this show and its probably one of the best stumble I've made in a long time.
I absolutely adore this show. I haven't seen anything this original and humorous in a speck of time.
Everyone should watch this show!!"
329,"Really easy watching and funny to watch.
Can watch on repeat and really hope this doesn't get cancelled!!"
330,"I don't race home to watch this, but overall I enjoy the easy comedy. I could do without Stevie, but love David!!"
331,"I'm a pretty picky person with tv shows but this show is really great! The cast and characters are really talented! Even the fashion is really nice to! I really hope this show will continue on and be just as new and hilarious! I'm not really great at writing reviews, but I hope people will check this show out and love it as much as I do. And I must thank everyone who works on this show for putting this together and their amazing work!"
332,"I was shocked to see so many negative reviews of Schitt's Creek because my family enjoys the quirky humour. Finding something my theatre-loving daughter, hanging-with-my-squad son, and everybody's-friend son can all agree on is rare but this show has hooked us all! I will admit that it's a slow burn; after the first show, we were all asking, ""What WAS that?"" The show's fish-out-of-water concept is not original, but that doesn't mean it isn't fun. Give it a few episodes - if you don't laugh out loud during ""Don't Worry; It's His Sister,"" then perhaps the show isn't for you. The characters in the show are all unique and the character growth throughout the seasons is a journey we are grateful to be on. When you're introduced to the Rose family, you're prepared to despise their pretentiousness. In fact, despite the fact that their fall from grace is no fault of their own, you're almost thinking they deserved it. Watching them adjust to life in Schitt's Creek feels like a guilty pleasure. The writers are clever, though, to always include an undercurrent of love in this family (""Finding David."") The transformation of the characters is incredible. Johnny Rose rediscovers his roots from his hardworking days back at Rose Video. Eugene Levy is the steady helm of the show as his character struggles to find a way to earn money I'd almost watch just for Moira's outfits and wigs; her self-involvement and quest to regain the spotlight is both pitiable and understandable. However, Moira shows she's willing to help out others without receiving any benefits (""Murder Mystery"") and that she truly loves her children (""Grad Night."") Despite the desire to return to their previous status as an elite family, the Rose family demonstrates an appreciation of Schitt's Creek residents and all they've given the family (""Happy Anniversary."") David's character was described in other reviews as annoying, but I find him hilarious. He says what the rest of us are so often thinking! Daniel Levy's mannerisms and expressions will have you grinning ear-to-ear. Watching his interactions with his family and - more importantly - the friendship he forms with Stevie (played with apathetic perfection by Emily Hampshire) make you wish you had a room at the Rosebud Inn so you could hang with them. Alexis grows the most throughout the series. Her approach to relationships, education, and career completely changes throughout the series. The residents of Schitt's Creek welcome the Roses, even if they don't always understand them. Chris Elliot and Jennifer Robertson play Roland and Jocelyn Schitt, a couple deeply in love and completely oblivious to their ridiculousness. We should all be so happy just as we are. Sarah Levy plays Twyla, the put-upon waitress you hope will find happiness. Additional supporting characters all contribute to the authenticity of the town. 
Give this series a chance if you like off-beat humour and characters that are somehow simultaneously likable and flawed. If you aren't going to watch the whole series, at least throw on ""Rooms by the Hour"" or ""Stop Saying Lice!"" so you know you've truly given the show a chance."
333,Hopefully don't understand how people think this show is so great! I had friends on Facebook say it gets better but it never did. I finally gave up on episode nine. It's so cliché and unoriginal. Acting is good however.
334,"Some funny moments, I get that. It's got Bobby Bitman and Lola Heatherton! Am I the only one who notices that the parents are in their 70's and the kids, mid thirties! Why are they all together? Still, it's Canadian comic royalty."
335,"Whatever you do PLEASE never add a laugh track, it's a sure sign the show is over."
336,"What a home run, my favorite TV comedy since Cheers. He is a genius."
337,"This show is perfection, anyone who says otherwise is cracked."
338,"OMG... I cried throughout the last two episodes (when I wasn't laughing out loud). Such great characters, such great writing, such great love. I feel so lucky to have seen all of these episodes... I'm better because of it. Thank you to all who created and performed in Schitt's Creek!"
339,"Just finished watching Schitt's Creek for the first time and I don't know what to do with my life anymore 😭❤. This show is brilliant, witty, funny and just freaking awesome!! 😍 Definitely goes in my top 5 all time fav shows🎊😍. Give this Emmy award winning show a watch if you haven't already!! I swear you won't regret it! 🙌❤"
340,"This show is pretty much flawless. I had a hard time grasping it During The first season but I knew I WAS VIEWING SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. No laugh tracks, no music backgrounds. Think how hard that is to not ""overstuff"" each episode like American Episodic Comedies. The acting therefore HAS to be top notch. These actors do not disappoint! Catherine O'Hara? I mean COME ON! The weird can't quite place it accent and the wigs? Omg. Eugene, Dan and the supporting cast are all Flawless. Also thrilled that this show swept the Comedy and Comedy Acting Emmys. Well deserved. CA-CAW! CA-CAW!"
341,This is a show I could watch multiple times! I love the character development and humor! Good mix of comedy and heartwarming moments! Avoids many typical overused cliches as well.
342,Watch this for some of the most uplifting and comic series around.
343,"Let me say that overall this is not a BAD comedy, but unfortunately it suffered a massive downfall from around season 4-6, meaning 3 whole seasons of forgettable content. What went from a great, quirky sitcom about a former wealthy family struggling to adapt to rural life became, as I like to call it, 'The David and Patrick Show'. The show simply dropped the importance of its other main/side characters, where their side plots in the episodes would simply be filler around David and Patrick being a couple. Also, once they were engaged, it just became a downward slide towards the inevitable wedding ending.The development of the characters, aside from the Rose family and Stevie, just did not exist - are we really supposed to care about one dimensional characters like Ronnie? Or even when Bob's wife leaves him - who cares? There's not enough substance in these characters, and even the Schitt family themselves just become the occasional comedic whipping horse in about 2 minutes of each episode, seriously what happened to their son who they were estranged with?? Did they forget that had another child? And also with Jocelyn's teaching job, when was the last time we saw anything to do with that? The Schitts even disappeared right at the end of the finale, which just highlights the rush in which the series was written.Things happened simply because they needed to happen, with absolutely no build up or logic - ""Oh let's make Twyla a secret millionaire because we need something to teach Alexis about money, that makes sense right?"".Overall, this sitcom isn't completely unwatchable, the first couple seasons definitely had some great and touching moments, unfortunately it's always hard to look past something once great that ended so poorly. I'll always remember my relationship ending with schitts creek as not one of tears and joy, but one of relief that it was finally over."
344,"We will watch 3 or 4 episodes and know we should go to be, but watch one and sometimes two more. It isa show you do not want to end."
345,"Schitt's Creek is weird, unexpected, crazy, ...but so refreshing, so good !
A must watch !"
346,"Schitt's Creek is a visual delight, and really kind to its viewers. And that's not to say it's predictable. Well, somewhat, sure, but in a feel-good way; not in an ugh-i-can't-sit through-this kind of way.It has some of the most ambitious yet realistic character development. Characters don't go from black to white or white to black or stay stagnant, like in most other shows. Here, they stay grey or reach grey, like most people do in life, despite tremendous growth. No one's ever really perfect, and yet you end up falling in love with each of its imperfect characters.It's truly one of the most glorious pieces of art and writing I've seen in a long long time. It is compassionate, awkwardly hilarious (think: arrested development but way less arrested), sassy, woke, real and utopian (yes, it's father, brother-sister, best-friend AND couple goals), all at the same time.And most importantly, it has THE best portrayal of the LGBTQ community I've seen on television. It's devoid of homophobia and while that's idealistic, it's groundbreaking, isn't it?It gave me love, hope, calmness and happiness. Please watch, if you want laughter, feels, sniffles and some fresh quips in your repertoire! I hope this intrigues some of you into giving this a shot, if you haven't yet, because it deserves a much larger audience and fanbase."
347,"You have singlehandedly created one of the best comedies ever, and NOW it's almost over! Devestated! I have never enjoyed a cast and scripts that are so ""on point"" on so many levels. Heart, compassion and nuanced would describe each character and their arcs. I have laughed, I have cried and more. On one hand, I am grateful that so many people are discovering this now, on the other hand I hate shark g this fantastic show with others. What a shame this is the final season. But due to the scripts, delivery and charm, this show has such wonderful rewatchability.
thank you all for the memories"
348,"Best show ever! It has everything, comedy, drama, heartfelt relationships, great acting and suspense. Took awhile, but I binged for a week. A must see."
349,"This show was overlooked by the Television Academy for FAR TOO LONG. Should have a numerous EMMYs by now! Make it right Academy, you have a small window!"
350,"There is no other series like this. Characters that are as endearing and surprising as they are hilarious. The script is as brilliant and unpredictable as anything I have ever seen. I would rank its wit right up there with movies like O Brother, where art thou? or the Princess Bride. It's just that good!And I never expected a show, like this, to teach me life lessons. This show unpretentiously reminds us to find a little humanity in ourselves, while recognizing that we are all human. Truly sweet without the sap.I can't describe this show, but everyone who took my advice to give it a try has loved it."
351,"Omg, this show is hysterical. All of the actors are on point, and I think everyone has met a Moira in their life at some point!"
352,I am sad that this little gem of a show is coming to an end. I have laughed and cried my way through 5 seasons and I will no doubt do the same for Season 6.
353,"This is a little gem of a show. So simple and yet so remarkable. The Roses have lost all their money and start to live in a sleepy town but how they gradually get absorbed into the little activities around the town and get close to the people.
Each of them find their own cause and grow into better people and close into each other as a family.
And all of this is done in a hilarious way. All the actors are top notch but I am a fan of Alexis's. She has a strange way of talking which at times is so amusing. A special mention to the dialogues. They are the ones that make it special. Brief and funny and pointed. All in all I loved it."
354,"As I write this I am currently finishing up Season 4. You don't understand how much this show has made me cry and laugh. The friendship between David and Stevie is just the purest thing ever. When they realized that they've because each other's very first best friend was one of the sweetest moment of this show. The relationship between David and Patrick always makes me ugly cry. Every time that they're together it's just the cutest thing ever. The ways that they show love for each other makes me want to find someone that I can sing ""The Best"" by Tina Turner to and that would get me a giant heart shaped cookie for our 4 month anniversary. I love this show so much. Give it try. You won't regret it."
355,Best show I've seen since arrested Development. Requires a rewatch to catch all the zingers!
356,This is a well written and acted show. The jokes are quality and you have to pay attention or miss the quick wit. The shows are short given there are no commercials so you can smash a few in one go. I'd recommend this to anyone with a sense of humour.
357,Love love love this show. So addicting. I can't get enough of Dan Levy. He's adorable and great actor. The other actors deserve equal credit but Dan Levy is my secret crush.
358,"I have danced around watching this show. My aunt told me about it and I was a little apprehensive because I DO NOT like Best in Show, but I gave it a chance and this show is hilarious! The characters are oddly endearing and the chemistry is spot on. Sooooo good!"
359,"This is by far the best show I have ever watched! Not usually a fan of comedy, romance or feelings in general (I prefer action, murder and science fiction). But friends of mine kept quoting the show and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I am so glad they kept telling me to watch it! I can't believe how much I love it. I watch episodes just about everyday. It's wonderful to watch something so good and pure to take your mind off of all the terrible things happening in the world. I love all the relationships and how the characters have grown. I wish everyone could be like the residents of Schitt's Creek and the Roses. So inclusive and non-judgmental! I could go on and on about how this show is the absolute best. Do yourself a favor and watch it! I guarantee you won't be sorry!"
360,"The character development & facial/ body expressions along with an awesome story line have hooked me! Rarely watch TV, but this show has been addictive! Have loved Eugene Levy for years, but Dan Levy is my new beloved! Shine on you beautiful diamond!!!"
361,"This show is more than just funny. This cast of comedic actors are virtuosos. It's truly amazing to watch Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy flex their muscles like this. I heave spent decades being hilarious, and yet this may be the funniest they have ever been.And Daniel Levy exceeds all expectations. I was worried that the son wouldn't live up, but his comedy is an absolute revelation. He's as funny as his father. Remarkable!In fact, all the younger performers hold their own. This show really is among the best on tv."
362,Such a well scripted and cast show. David and Alexis play the part so well. They do the same facial expressions and are really believable as brother and sister.Lovely to see Eugene and Danial working together.And I love Catherine O'Hara's weird accent. No one knows what accent it's supposed to be ! Lol.
363,I really appreciate the positive humor and how they touch on real world issues.
364,"First of all, you idiots that think ""David"" is a teenager obviously haven't watched the show as it's hinted to many many times that he's in his early 30's.
I started watching this as just a ""filler"" when I didn't want an hour long drama. I was hooked after 2 episodes and even watch while on the treadmill frequently laughing out loud causing me to get glances at the gym.
I absolutely love all the characters, but especially Alexis and David, their mannerisms crack me up!! The show also has its ""aaawww"" moments and I'm loving the character development as I continue my way into season 4. Bravo! Now Netflix has to hurry up and get season 5 online!"
365,"I started watching this show knowing that it is something that I am supposed to like, because of all the awards and great reviews, but it left me extremely disappointed. Maybe it is the expectations that weren't matched, because it was supposed to be funny. When I went through the first 2 seasons, haven't laughed once, I thought, I should use a different approach and look at it as it'a drama with funny bits. Then I realized that I cannot relate or feel for, for any characters in this tv show, because the only way how I know there is a relationship between any of them is not because the acting, but because the lines they deliver try to convince me that there should be something. Not saying that they are bad actors, but just the whole thing was extremely plain if you compare it to comedy series like ""Arrested development"" that it is trying to be like, I guess or any other great comedy series. Not awful, but definitely not great. Do not recommend"
366,"This was excellent. The acting was good and the characters well developed. I love Eugene Levy His comedy is brilliant, however the series lost focus in the last couple of seasons, mainly focusing on David's wedding instead of the family dilemma. I stopped watching halfway through the final season because one of my favorite characters (Ted) exited the show I don't understand how writers think that viewers don't like happy endings. TV is supposed to be a fun pastime, not some pithy political statement. I deducted 3 stars for the last 2 seasons."
367,Why does the mom (forget her name) wear a vest and pin to bed??? Totally weird!!! Haha
368,"We were late to the party. For years, we thought it was going to be another stupid comedy like Portlandia, plus the title Schitt's Creek was a turnoff. But Covid-19 showed up and we needed something to binge-watch.This is really funny; we actually laughed to tears at times. All the characters are funny, the script is well written and the lines are delivered with just enough pause for us to understand the punchlines and have time enough to laugh about it. Then on to the next set up and delivery with laughs. You don't get that kind of timing with 30 Rock or The Office, which we still don't understand."
369,"The writing is brilliant. The characters were well cast, and found their fully developed story lines by the third season. If you're looking for humor smarter than The Office, this is a must-see. Eugene and Dan Levy are a pair that have created perfection. I am so thankful for this life-changing series."
370,"I simply cannot comprehend why everyone loves this so much.It is so bad as to be unintelligible.The acting is cringeworthy, the script is dire and there is not one solitary joke or humorous it isn't even ironic.21 minutes of my life that I will not get back."
371,"This show was rated poorly then thousands of reviews showed up simultaneously, by people who coincidentally had never rated anything before, giving it 10's and 9's. Wow what a coincidence!This show is not terrible. Anything with three comedy legends in it like O'Hara, Levy (the older one not the talent starved son) and Chris Elliott has to be good. Whoever plays the sister is also charming and can be funny as well. But the writing is awful, based on nothing but tons of gay stereotype jokes, fish out of water rich jokes and above all else the scatological dad jokes that come with literally creating a show called ""Schitt's Creek.""The show doesn't even make sense. They're rich, their accountant stole their money, but... they still own a town? Well, you can't own a government so that means they own the land, which means they can either collect rent from a bunch of people and businesses, or they can sell it and move somewhere decent. I guess they decided just to ignore those basic facts so they could keep their ""hilarious"" premise of characters owning a town called Poop Something.Almost no thought was put into this show. The characters are one dimensional and the jokes are predictable and very bad. Oddly they are trying very hard to be woke but the show is full of stereotypes, effeminate gay bashing and undercutting feminism.The bottom line? The show's real stars do what they can, but the writing is so far beneath them, the premise is flawed and cheap, and for a comedy it's simply not funny! All the fake reviews in the world won't change that."
372,"There's really nothing quite like the mixture of sweet and tart in this show that I can compare it to. Season 4, in particular, has some of the sharpest writing I've seen in this era of peak television. The way that Alexis was able to atone for and grow as a person as she tries to not want to win Ted back is really outstanding. The once selfish socialite has learned to put Ted first. Meanwhile, David has also found some success in his business and through his first grown up relationship. The show blows me away in that with short episodes and short seasons, we don't just get to know the Roses but their friends. Stevie grows as a character and rather than being jealous of David's happiness, she's happy for him. Roland turns out to be a wonderful and too attentive husband. Ted, who has every reason to hate Alexis, learns not only to forgive her but finds the courage to give her another chance. Patrick becomes comfortable with his sexuality and loving David while not being a pushover. Plus, it's all super funny. One of my favorite scenes is when David convinces Ted to give Alexis another chance. I also love any scene that features Johnny and Roland, which is always just low key hilarious."
373,Believe the one star reviews. This show is not funny and a complete waste is time. Junk.
374,"Always sunny, nathan for you, flight of the conchords, the office, parks & rec, modern family, arrested development, tpb, reno 911, chappelle show, mr show, summer heights high, curb your enthusiasm, wkuk & def a few more that i'll only recall once i press submit.if you feel the same, you'll probably be pleased w/ schitt's creek, despite its insufferable trailers & promos."
375,This show is hysterical. Binge-worthy for sure! I've watched 3 seasons in a week. The Levys are amazing and all of the actors are fantastic. I laugh every episode. Wish there were more seasons!! Everyone watch it!!
376,"While the first season did take a bit to ramp up, this show is one of the best written shows currently on television. The actors all bring their ""A"" game each episode, helping us fall in love with the dysfunctional, quirky Rose family and community of Schitt's Creek. Eugene and Dan Levy are possibly the strongest artistic father/son duo to grace the screen in the last century! This show tackles large societal issues in such a humorous way, it will have you in stitches.Cannot wait to see this show continue on for several more seasons. If you're a fan of good TV, I cannot suggest this show enough!"
377,"Saw the million ads and it wasn't on my list at all (in fact I was ignoring it because ""it looks dumb) but a friend recommended it and I'm so glad he did. Awesome, easy to watch, comedy. I've laughed out loud at least once in every episode. The Roses and the Schitts might make you cringe but the lines are hilarious. I'm not sure where all of the negative reviews come from - this isn't the type of show I normally watch but it's awesome."
378,"This show is amazing: heartfelt, irreverent, hilariously cringey.The character development over the last four seasons has been wonderfully written; changes seem natural and logical and not contrived.The chemistry between all the actor's is amazing!David and Patrick's relationship is one of my favourite things about the show! I would be so happy if they made a spin-off just about their relationship!! 10/10 would watch!!For people complaining that the gay stuff is too much: Ugh! Get over yourselves! We're all people who deserve love and deserve to be visible and deserve to be well represented on TV shows. Canadian LGBTQ+ folks also pay taxes and deserve their stories told too!MORE DAVID AND PATRICK AND THEIR SWEET SWEET LOVESTORY!"
379,"I was hesitant to take a chance because of some of the bad reviews on IMDB, but I was unexpectedly surprised by how much I like this series. I like it so much that I binged all four seasons on Netflix before writing this review. The story starts slow, so I recommend watching at least three episodes before forming an opinion. That shouldn't take much more than hour of your time since each episode is ~22 minutes without commercials.The premise is the well-worn story of fish-out-of-water, and the first few episodes use the expected cliches of (formerly) rich meet poor. However, once all of the main characters are fleshed out the series soon finds its groove. The characters get toned down and really start to grow on you. Contrary to other reviewers, I found the acting to be good to great. Some of it might have been a bit spotty in the first episode or two, but that's to be expected with any new series before the actors find their footing in a character.The standout actor for me is the daughter, played by Annie Murphy. She perfectly portrays a spoiled-but-sweet self-absorbed socialite. Her character is open-minded to her sudden change of fortune and shows the most growth throughout the series. Dan Levy is also excellent as the uptight but likable son. Their brother/sister dynamic feels so natural that you would think they're actual siblings.Eugene Levy is an old pro and steady as the disgraced patriarch and Catherine O'Hara is hammily over-the-top as the pretentious matriarch, a washed-up soap actress drama queen. I have always found a little Chris Elliott to go a long way, but fortunately the show quickly finds the right balance and his character is reduced to more of a secondary role. Jennifer Robertson is also great as his exasperated wife.I am only giving the series nine stars because I don't quite consider it a comedy classic. However, the characters are very charming and the rapid-fire dialogue is consistently witty and clever and the story mostly avoids expected cliches. The series has heart as well as laughs and is far superior to any current American network comedy. Canada does itself proud and I eagerly anticipate season five."
380,"Emily Blunt over at BluntReview (dot) com says: There's a new show on cable's PopTv, called, Schitt's Creek (yes as in up a, but fear not the cellophane pun). Schitt's Creek is one of the funniest, well-written and cast-d, little slice of hilarity audiences have been served up in a decade; look for it, know it, love it. There are no laugh tracks, no high-tech stunts, no studio audience laughing on cue. Just Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy leading, as a Mr. and Mrs. Rose. Okay, a caveat. Those who adored SCTV or any of the comedic renderings in say,a Christopher Guest-style, will adore; Millennials? Not so much.Story goesThe uber-wealthy, upper-crusty, snobzilla's known as The Rose Family have been recently de-cashed and stripped bare of the 1%-er lifestyle they so enjoyed.But as the government seized their all the name-brand stuffs, and babbles, the family was left a small long-forgotten investment found deep in their portfolio.Seems, they'd bought, as a lark, a now deemed worthless town called Schitt's Creek.That's it. Wealthy folks go to rural setting sans accouterments de richeand the hilarity starts from frame one episode one. As agents loot the home, the Rose Family, in shock and awe, grab what they can and head to this Schitt's Creek as they've no place else to go.That's all you need to know. Well, that and Catherine O'Hara (a freakin' comic legend) will make you have after-laughter at often inappropriate times. And, perhaps, that the Levy gene carries with it a funny streak; Eugene's son and daughter shine in the cast (Daniel and Sarah). Daniel, as David Rose, plays the too-hip-for-you-or-your-family with some of the best quips; though, every character gets great zingers - listen closely for best laughs-per-episode volume. Oh, and as a general ""The more you know,"" avoid eating or drinking when Chris Elliot steals scenes with his ""wife"" Jennifer Robertson, you could choke; Fondue? Never again. Ever. Just saying. And, the Rose family daughter played by Annie Murphy is spot on; she done do dumb debutante delightfully. Granted, you need to watch from the start to know what's going on; still wickedly funny on own...but, in a makes-more sense way. The station site has episodes up. Then once you're in sync, seriously, go to the PopTv.com website and enjoy the extra ""tours"" of some areas in Schitt's. Hilarious, just hilarious. Enjoy."
381,"I had heard about but missed this series ... until today when I watched episode one of season one on The CW's Seed online channel. It is a creation of Eugene Levy and his family, and the cast includes his son and his daughter.It is basically a 'Gilligan's Island' story with different key features. Instead of an unforecast storm it is an unforecast loss of money, instead of being marooned on an uncharted island they are cast away to a motel in a small town. They want to escape to their former lives but things keep getting in their way.I like Eugene Levy and here he is pretty good. (He would be 'The Skipper.' ) But all the other characters are very annoying. Overly annoying. Maybe it gets better as the family establishes itself in Schitt's Creek after having all their wealth confiscated but I'll never know. I suppose that is an indication of the impact of an introductory episode. I just hate programs with overly annoying characters.So I gave it a few weeks and one more chance, I watched the episode where Moira is doing a commercial for a local winery. Nope, still a big miss for me. They are all overly annoying in this episode. So my initial evaluation stands. 'Gilligan's Island' was far more entertaining."
382,"This show is HILARIOUS. You may have to push through the first two episodes, but as soon as the show starts gaining a little bit of momentum, it is incredible. So so so funny, but also extremely heart warming at the same time. Shows like this remind us all that what truly matters in life is the people we share it with, and that sometimes the complexities of this world can make one act shallow and vapid, even though on the inside they have a big heart. This show can make you laugh one minute, and then tear up the next. Whoever reviewed this negatively probably doesn't have the capacity or interest to think deeper into things that may appear simple, but actually contain a lot of meaning and positive values."
383,"Perfect script, perfect cast, perfect in every way! My new obsession. I'm so grateful that this show is on the POP network which is offered through my DirecTV! I binge watched all 5 seasons after discovering this show. (22 minute show with No commercials!). Omg... Eugene Levi, Dan Levi, Catherine O'Hara, Annie Murphy, Chris Elliott... and Sarah Levy! (Eugene Levy's real life, extremely talented son & daughter - Dan & Sarah) I LOVE this Show and this Cast!!"
384,"I'm not sure why there are negative reviews for this show. Schitt's Creek is easily the best show on CBC. The actors are all skilled: Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara are comedic legends, and their on-screen son and daughter, played by Dan Levy and Annie Murphy, are perfect in their roles. The supporting cast, such as Chris Elliot and Emily Hampshire, who play the mayor and Stevie, respectively, all add another dimension of hilarity. The writing is superb, with very clever humour riddled throughout. Unfortunately, some people may not recognize brilliant comedy from a show without a laugh soundtrack dubbed in. I hope this show does well, seeing as how it is superior to 95% of other programs on TV today."
385,"This show is so funny! Every time I'm in a bad mood or had a long day an episode of Schitt's Creek puts me in a good mood again! It's one of the funniest shows I've seen in years. Eugene and Daniel Levy are hilarious! Such a light hearted, hilarious show! Highly recommended!"
386,Thought it was pretty Schitt. Love great comedy but found this full of stupidity
387,"This was suppose to be a comedy right? I just could not find the jokes in it at all. Must not be my thing, but just could not understand the hype."
388,"Really don't get the negative reviews, this is an excellent binge worthy show. So glad Netflix picked it up or else I wouldn't have heard of it! I only choose to watch it because I heard about it off of a barstool podcast, take it or leave it! But Annie Murphy is so adorable and funny, the show makes me laugh, tear up... not cry! I didn't cry!! The idea of the show is brilliant, and it is executed to perfection. Highly recommend!"
389,"Love this season of schitt's creek, as I did all others. The growth, the embracing of where they are, and seeing guys in love as normal is such a breathe of fresh air. fun, conscious, relevant. Love it."
390,If you haven't watched it..do! I thought I had seen everything on Netflix but discovered Schitts Creek. Hilarious show with a great story line and heart. Great chemistry between all the actors. You fall in love with every character.
391,Such a great show. The ensemble deserves every award. Can't wait for season 5!!
392,"Just finished watching this series. At first, I didn't really enjoy it, but the characters definitely grow on you and you find yourself rooting for them in the end! There are some moments of comedy gold in each episode, and the supporting cast is brilliant!"
393,Never got around to watching this series (sorry)... just watched three seasons... bravo... genius...
394,With this cast you can't go wrong! Each season gets better and better. All the cast grow on you to where your rooting for them each episode
395,HOW can you cast a 36 yr old to play a...... what is it... 16 yr old fighting his grown up 32 yr old sister all the time? This was SO awkward to watch... no no no no no
396,"I rarely write review but this show deserves it, not least of all because of the OTT 1* ratings people who clearly either have no soul, or haven't actually watched more than 30 seconds.The chemistry between Eugene Levvy & Catherine O'Hara is totally on point. Moira Rose will replace Karen Walker as one of the funniest characters on TV and thats saying something!The whole cast just ""work"". I've watched the entire 4 seasons and feel i need to watch them all again.. Everyone i've introduced to this series thinks its amazing, and quite hysterical. My only complaint is that the episodes aren't long enough!"
397,"Here in the states, POP TV did not market this show well and that's a shame because it's so much better than what it was marketed as, which was a mean-spirited Arrested Development knockoff. It's so much richer, well-written and funnier than the ads or the name implies. The first two seasons are good and by season three and four it's really brilliant. The show develops its characters and manages to get you to care about them but never gets too sentimental. By season four, a few episodes made me cry but they are never sappy.I hate the humor of humilation, but this show pokes fun at its characters without sacrificing their dignity.The show also takes a lot of tired tropes and reinvents them. The character of David, with his flamboyance, could have come off as a one-note joke. Instead, he's a three-dimensional, pansexual protaganist who grows as a person and is allowed to be talented and successful. Moira could have been the target of a slew of sexist jokes about her aging desperation, but the show goes in the opposite direction. Alexis could have just been a pretty face and the target of airhead/sl*t jokes, but she too is a rich character and allowed to develop. Yet, they all stay funny.I love the fact that there is zero sl*t shaming on this show. The characters, be they straight, gay, bi or pansexual (and there are all of those represented) are never shamed for enjoying sex.Eugene Levy is also darn near perfect as the family patriarch who has lost everything.Edited to add: The show remains hilarious in Season 5. After the heavy-ish emotion of Season 4, they first half of Season 5 is just wallowing in silliness and letting the characters be their crazy selves. Moira in the bird's nest is a comedy classic."
398,"To those who hate this show ...and there are plenty from the IMDB reviews ..are you quite clear that is not intended to be realistic ,but in fact is a satire about the complete schism of experience and understanding between the urban ,rich,pampered and dim and the rural or small town ,modest in income and outlook, and dim .? It is poking gentle sometimes funny fun at each of these groups and i kind of believe there may be some who think that some of the drama and some of the characters and some of the plot is silly without realising it is upposed to be silly 
Only the minor background characters like Stevie are portrayed as normal and sane .
The acting is superb and Dan Levy is excellent ...my only minor criticism is that the programme scripts are becoming a little samey because the set up doesnt give much scope for development .
But definitely worth a long look ."
399,"Did this series win that many Emmys? Really? I was just binge watching it during this quarantine after hearing its success and man, it was just plain horrible, that cracked smile occurred after the garden's title fail by Eugene Levy's character in S02 , that is all.
Unbelievable, unimaginable, dumb, sloppy, over the top, unimportant, many times rather annoying storyline and conflicts, it is really a horrible show - Eugene Levy's character is mostly likable, but the focus is on his homosexual son. No problem with that, but they did not manage to make it interesting or enjoyable or relatable, let alone funny. Really disappointed that in late 2010's this series is considered good and even gets 6 seasons and awards. I really hope that TV is not going to this direction, when the most relatable and ""important"" plot is to be able to keep a baby's gender unrevealed. The other episodes' stories? Even less interesting or relatable..."
400,I just started watching last night This show is sweet and funny
401,This is truly the funniest show on tv right now. Eugene Levy is brilliant! I am literally laughing from the beginning to end the humor is beyond witty. They don't miss a beat on this show!
402,"Schitt's Creek is one of the best comedies I've seen in a long time. Its down to earth, small town comedy. Its kind of what you may expect living in a back woods community.I read a review by Aroseu1967, who is basically out to lunch. Yes, Corner Gas was great, and Schitt's Creek is a gem. However, you have no idea what you are taking about, that Canada and CBC has not produced any worthwhile tv in the past. How about Trailer Park Boys, Just for Laughs GAGS, The Beach Combers, The Forest Rangers, Front Page Challenge, The Friendly Giant, Wayne and Schuster, Wojeck (with John Vernon) and the list goes on and on. People should do some research and know what they are talking about before submitting reviews."
403,"I can't wait for Tuesday nights! I LOVE this show. Best Canadian comedy in SO many years. It's funny and clever. Love seeing old pro's Eugene Levy and Catherine )'Hara in all their legendary glory! But the ""newcomers"" playing their kids are great, too. In the first few episodes they play just shallow, phony people but character development is happening as the first season progresses! Thank you, CBC, for putting this show on the air! It's not just for Canadians, either. The fact that the Rose family WAS super rich makes it funny for anyone who knows of people like the Kardashians or Paris Hilton - people famous for being famous. Anyway, I highly recommend it to anyone (except my Mum - she's 89). p.s. go to the CBC website to see lots of ""behind the scenes"" extra - hilarious, too!"
404,"I watched this initially because of the teasers with the two main characters. I couldn't remember their names but had seen them in other things and knew I liked them and I'm sure I will know their names from now on. I am so glad that I watched. I find many things to be ""funny"" but without actually laughing out loud. Not so with this comedy. It caught me by surprise and totally off guard. From the subtlety of the wigs hanging all over the hotel room walls to the absolutely enormous menus at the restaurant as if to compensate for the fact that it was a greasy spoon. The subtly of the acting would have to be, and is, right on the mark otherwise it wouldn't have the intended effect. The visuals are wonderful. This series has huge potential"
405,"Just fabulous, enjoyed every minute of this series..
Brilliant acting and sooo funny"
406,"I started this show when it was brand new and no one had heard of it, and liked it a lot. The nostalgia is abundant with the mom from Beetlejuice (Catherine O'Hara) and the dad from American Pie (Eugene Levy), plus Dan Levy and Annie Murphy are fresh but not too fresh faces, with a progressive sitcom feel. It's a pretty perfect concept, but not groundbreaking. It was comforting and fun, which may just have been what people needed in 2020. But, I actually appreciated it far more when it felt like a gem, rather than a hit. IMO, it doesn't really fit the stereotype of TV everyone's talking about. It is heartfelt and funny. The characters are great. It's progressive. But, it's not THAT great, especially season 6, which was just ok. Season 1 was the best - the sign joke was hilarious.Probably my only complaint is that I grew up in a small town and it's portrayal of small town people is not very realistic. People in small towns are really not that different from larger cities, and it's not like they don't travel. Maybe it used to be like that a couple generations ago (and I haven't lived in a small town for 20 years), but I know people are really not that isolated anymore. Also, I think it's always been a myth that somehow small towns are more welcoming or less clique-ish. Quite the opposite, actually, values are quite narrow and uninviting to non-conformists. Cities are actually better for diversity."
407,"I'm watching it for the second time and love it just as much if not more. It's lovely to see how they evolve through each season & how much love there is. There is no laugh track... just excellent & exquisitely timed expressions. When Patrick sings ""You're simply the best""...ugh! Level up! Just gets better and better with every episode. The relationship between David & Patrick is just what it is. So refreshing to see...no family turmoil, no drama, just everyone wanting the best for this couple. Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy are legends. It was so nice to hear how much everyone in the cast looked up to the and how humble and gracious they were. True Canadians! I love that it was created by Canadians, filmed in Canada and celebrated it's well deserved emmy sweep in Toronto. So proud! 🇨🇦 Must watch!"
408,"My family, boyfriend and I all love this show. We can't choose a favourite character because they are all so great. A must watch."
409,"This show literally defies expectations. From the show title and blurb, I thought I knew exactly what this show was and I avoided it. But I saw an interview with Benedict Cumberbatch who raved about the performances so I gave it a go. And it was nothing like my expectations. Everytime there's a set-up for a typical sit-com gag or cringe situation, it goes in another, more intelligent direction. You rarely know what's coming and I love it. The performances are incredible, the entire cast is great with no weak links. I binged all the series in one weekend then went straight to episode 1 and watched it again.It's just SO GOOD. Give it a go, you won't regret it"
410,"This quickly became my favorite show after we found it on Netflix. After finishing Season 5, we immediately started to watch it again. So many quotable moments, laughs, and heart."
411,It takes a family to lose it all to realise they never needed it - a beautifully written and played ensemble piece that's laugh out load emotional rollercoaster. Witty one liners that you'll be using in your repertoire and restoring faith in the power of a family unit. 10/10! Love love love
412,"Funnier than brooklyn 99, the office, parks and rec and whatever else people say are funny"
413,"This is one of the best shows I've ever watched. I wasn't expecting it to be so engaging. The characters are over the top, but fun and believable. An incredible cast. Each one is my ""favorite"". Definitely a great series to binge watch."
414,"What a hilarious show. I love the banter between the siblings. The mother's over the top dramatic responses. I laugh out loud at least ""thrice"" times every time I watch it. Not a chuckle-a loud laugh. The son steals the show. Every episode. The ""thrice"" comment was when I was sold on the show and his character."
415,"This is so well written, smart and funny and catchy. Can't say enough good things about it. Love it, love it, please watch it"
416,"An amazing show with hilarious comedy, drama, romance, and all about family in a little of an unorthodox way. After the first couple episodes I was absolutely hooked and I have watched all your seasons 3 times now and reccomend it to several of my family members, and all my friends and coworkers. It has some swearing throughout the episodes and some adult humor, so maybe not for children, but for a little older of a crowd for sure!"
417,"The earlier seasons were great but as the show progressed it focused more on showing/developing the gay characters, not my cup of tea"
418,I absolutely love this show! So funny with intelligent humor. The writing is top notch. I find myself thinking about the show and I want to watch more. It's really a hidden gem for comedy lovers.
419,"I've watched the first four seasons twice, but sadly, the fifth season has descended into a gay agenda. When will they ever learn? Funny wins. Stop it with the not so subtle social b.s."
420,"Watched two seasons and it was awful, it must be the American sense of humour. It feels like a budget attempt of arrested development but with no storyline tbh, don't waste your time!"
421,Funny as hell!!! Binged watched the crap out of this show
422,"Roland is bullying them and shown like an innocent. Like he is a good person. And in fact he is getting on their nerves.
It's forced comedy. His actions are not funny at all. Barely watched first episode.Other roles are good. But when you put garbage in food no one will eat it."
423,This show is NOT good. It's Always Sunny is WAAAAAY better than this garbage. The overacting is ridiculous. It isn't funny at all. 4 Emmys? What?! You have got to be kidding me. No thank you. I should not have to force myself to watch something. LAME!
424,"This is a no-go for us. We watched a few and it was a misfire. It didn't get renewed. Old story, rich people get poor -- adapt. It gets zzzzzz."
425,I recall watching the first episode but getting distracted and thinking it was a silly show. I came back to the show and had to watch the series twice. IT IS NOT SILLY. It is over the top ruefully ironic and truely entertaining but requires one's attention to get the punchline
426,Haven't seen a great comedy like this in years. Only wish there were many more seasons.
427,"My husband and I were thrilled to find this new comedy. The writing is not just creative, but with each episode the characters become more fully developed. Much of the comedy is subtle so to listen carefully to each line of dialogue in order to catch every morsel of humor the writers and actors have to offer. Thankfully this show does not rely on tired stereotypes or tedious over acting.Casting is critical to a show's success and Schitt's Creek proves it with superbly talented major stars and well chosen actors for minor roles. If you have enjoyed Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara in the past you are in luck. Schitt's Creek is a playful showcase for the superb talents of these actors.Our Canadian neighbors have been sharing great comedic shows and actors for years. From across the pond have come quirky comedies (Monty Python) and superb dramas (Downton Abby). TV would not be as much fun without the addition of original programming from outside the U.S."
428,"I generally watch about 1 hours of TV per week maximum. I have watched every episode of Schitt's Creek and it just keeps getting better.Cannot believe the amount of negative reviews from almost every major Canadian newspaper (The Globe&Mail, The Toronto Star, Vanity Fair and the NYT). Google them and have a read.I suppose that the folks who wrote these reviews under estimated this show. Maybe they were suffering from SAD when they sat down to view the preview season after Xmas. Perhaps the don't know when to laugh and require a laugh track to get the witty dark humour littered throughout this wonderfully written show.I had criticized Schitt's Creek early on for not be ""Canadian"" enough. But I take that back. The show has brilliantly portrayed small town Ontario. CBC has finally hit gold. Maybe the loss of Hockey Night in Canada has pushed the CBC off it's complacent derrière! A little risk can generate big rewards, even when your up Schitt's Creek!"
429,I laughed so hard til i CRIED during the first season. I am in love w this quirky brilliant show and I adore the characters. I've rewound many of Catherine's lines and David's facial expressions. Such a fun find!!
430,The show is absolutely hilarious if you pay attention to society today whatsoever. I absolutely love watching these people try to figure things out after their life crashes down around them. Wonderful show
431,"I happen to start watching Schitts Creek by accident this month. I admit that the first season seemed quite nice, quite funny, but not much beyond. However, I am so happy I continued to watch it through it's 4th and wow!! it has matured into one of my favourite comedies ever!First and foremost I would like to give respect to one, Mr Dan Levy.
What a revelation. Certainly my personal discovery of the year, Daniel feels me with absolute joy and laughter every time I see him on screen. He is definitely one of the best comedians and writers out there today, and I hope he will receive much more praise in the future, because he deserves it.The variety of the writing on the show (Levy & Levy) is astonishing. The show continues to reinvent itself and stay fresh throughout. The cast is perfect, the acting is superb, and the intention is true and very convincing. Compare to American comedies, this Canadian show is a true diamond, and shows how comedy should be written, acted and produced. Simply a master class on how to create an original new comedy and sustain it's positive progression which each and every season.Schitt's Creek is also responsible to one of the best ever LGBT storylines and love entanglements I have ever seen on TV. It's delightfully and naturally performed, an absolute joy to watch!This show is genius. do not miss out on it!"
432,10 Minutes was enough. Can't understand the good reviews.
433,"Schitt's CreekI have gotten more than a few belly laughs out of this new show. The minute I heard the cast members I had to check it out.  It is fun, witty and spontaneous. As the characters develop, they become relatable and likable. Playing the mother: Catherine O'Hara as Moira, the prima-donna fading star; her distant snappy observations are a cutting joy. The father: Eugene Levy as John, his quirky stunted characterization is most welcome being the dry straight man stumbling for reason. His son (and co- developer),  Dan Levy, plays his son David and the resemblance is remarkable. The family's ennui pours through him in waves with him having to change and grow. A frightening development to consider! Annie Murphy plays the sister Alexis and she exemplifies the nymphet player with curiosity and heart. She flits through life slipping across wet stones.  The bickering between the two kids is pretty funny and endlessly relentless. They are gonna have to wake up soon and they will probably be dueling rivals the whole way towards enlightenment.Once this family's finances evaporate through embezzlement and all their earthly belongings are confiscated, they have one choice left; to migrate to a long before joke purchase of some funky little nowhere town. Next, Culture Shock: mingling with the town folk. It is a small town run by a redneck mayor with little manners, crude tendencies and overactive bowels. The motel desk gal is a down-to-earth type with no less a sharp sensible wit with a practical acceptance of life. Rounding out the town folk includes the mayor's wife,  the local waitress Twyla, is actually Sarah Levy real life daughter, Ray the real estate agent and his fellow town councilors and the mysterious hunk Mutt, among others.It is the meeting of the minds, from opposite realms, but nonetheless, equal in frustrations, war-of-wills, and difficult adjustments. Full of funny family observations, teenage frustrations and splintered parental control  lost over the years, if ever attained. But the love is clear and they will need each other.Each character has endearing qualities, tying you to their plight. You sense the road they must travel and can sit back and enjoy their frustrated efforts while watching their old dreams evaporate and new insights develop. A delight! Kimharvest /Also check out 'Getting On'! Another new great show!"
434,"I've heard about this show for a while now, decided to give it a try. I forced myself to watch half the first season because maybe it gets better as it goes along. It doesn't. After 7 episodes and about two laughs total, I'm giving up. This show is basically trying to be Arrested Development, except it's not funny and all the characters are unlikeable. Even the later seasons of AD are funnier than this show. They definitely got the name right though. It's Schitt."
435,It was a tolerable show in the first season and the plot was actually interesting. But after 4 seasons I haven't found anything funny. The quirkiness of Dave is humorous but nothing else about this show is entertaining.
436,"Very funny. Just don't try to over think it. Quirky and harm less, you don't have to go to deep to get the show.....and it comes in 23 minute bites (I mean that in a good way).If you like Eugene Levy, this show is for you and more. The rest of the cast has perfect whit and timing..... The range of gag's is from subtle (Giant menus) to over the top billboards. Which makes it what it is....an easy to watch sit com that doesn't always go for the home run but a solid base hit.Those who don't like are taking it to seriously, just relax and enjoy the ride.I heard about the show by word of mouth so don't be surprised if it's a hit next year. Looking forward to next season ....bravo!"
437,"I started watching this show because reviews here say that it's laugh out loud funny. I'm on the fourth episode and I haven't had a single laugh so I'm sorry but I'm out. I should've known, Eugene Levy wasn't funny in anything I've seen him."
438,Very good writing and each character is well played...ya just love each one! If you like witty/sarcastic humor than you will thoroughly enjoy this show.
439,"I have not laughed this much in a long time! Absolutely hilarious! These are the type of characters I would love to be around in real life, Stellar show!!"
440,This sitcom just gets better with every season! Season four just rocks! I love the character of David the best - but they are all so spot on and funny!
441,I don't know how this show got the ratings it did but it's rough. There are some funny parts but I spent most of the time wanting to hit everyone one the show
442,"Fell in love with show instantly! Heartwarming, funny and hopefull. All the characters are unique, acting superb and the story line will definitely make u binge watch the entire show at once."
443,"This show and it's dry (wonderful) humor makes fun of rich people on one hand and small town folk on the other. It's easy to say that one or the other is wrong, but please watch all 4 seasons before you make your determination. In my opinion, all 3 Levy's, O'hara, Robertson, Elliott, Hampshire and Reid are tremedndous."
444,"I thought the first few episodes were slow, but I would turn it on for background when I was surfing the web on my couch. By about episode 4 of season 1 I really started laughing out loud at parts. I do not watch a lot of TV mainly because it usually cannot hold my interest that long, but I'm really enjoying this show. As the show went on (Admittedly I am only halfway through first season) the characters have definitely evolved and have more depth than in the beginning."
445,"I can't say anything more than what's been said about this show already. The positive reviews are suspect so I figured I'd cancel one out. There are two good things. I enjoy watching Eugene Levy. And the other thing, it is like being glued to a train wreck. It's interesting to watch just to see how bad it can get!"
446,"Caught the show on POP and ended up watching the first six episodes OD. I think all the actors on the show are great but Catherine O'Hara is a show stealer. She is awesome. Daniel Levy and Annie Murphy are hilarious as brother and sister. I also found Emily Hampshire's character, Stevie, very interesting and very funny. If the show doesn't do well in the US it won't be because of the show itself because it is crazy funny. It will be the virtually unknown POP channel's inability to reach a wide enough viewership or haters of the show like greg-b who rant and rave all over message boards about how awful the show is. It must share the same time slot as his fav cooking show or something. He needs to pull the stick out and get over it. He spends an awful amount of time ranting about a show that he dislikes for me to give him one bit of credibility. I think the writing is very witty and modern. I absolutely love the show so I'm giving it 10/10."
447,"I consider myself pretty picky when it comes to television shows and I am even more particular when it comes to comedy. It can't be over the top to the point that I find it absurd. I also have no patience for hokey and corny. A show has to wow me in the first few moments or I continue my channel surfing. I adore comedy though and it's been a long time since I've laughed with a show rather than at it. I was fond of Modern Family until it became rather stale and I gave Better Call Saul a chance but was disappointed even though I gave it several chances. I'm a die-hard fan of Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm so that may give you an idea of what I find funny. I was pleasantly surprised with Schitt's Creek. The Roses, a formerly wealthy family, must relocate to a podunk town they happen to own and adjust to life as poor fish-out-of-water. The parents and their privileged children must endure culture shock as they struggle to get back on their feet. So far, after six episodes, I have found each and every episode fresh, entertaining and funny. Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara have already styled a winning performance as an on-screen couple and their chemistry works just as well here as it does in their previous collaborations (Best In Show, A Mighty Wind et al.) O'Hara plays her character a bit on the absurd side but this works since Levy plays against type by playing his character a little more toned down than usual. He's doing it a bit more straight which works well here since having two absurd characters would probably grow tiresome after a while. I like his subtle approach because many times less is actually more and he doesn't beat the audience over the head with an over the top character. That seems to be done easily enough by Chris Elliot who plays the mayor and, quite often, foil to Levy's character. The children are funny as the millenials who must now adjust to their quirky new lives. The town itself and its residents are probably what make the show so interesting. The writing is simple while remaining humorous. I find this show refreshing and hilarious- a much welcome alternative to the endless array of reality shows and talent(less) shows and complicated crime drama shows. This is mindless fun and for that I am grateful at the chance to relax."
448,"This really is a difficult show to review because there are some things to hate about it and some to love. I'm not sure David's love affairs should be as front and center because they are rather boring and his character is the most difficult to like. At times it's just way over the top. Alexis is my favorite as I have known girls like her that are really that ditzy. I think Johnny Rose, the father played by Eugene Levy is by far the most realistic and Catherine O'Hara's portrayal of Moira is by far the most ridiculous. I'm not crazy about Chris Elliot, the mayor of Schitt's Creek, but he's tolerable.Where this show shines is the majority of it is concentrated on the vapid cluelessness of the participants in the life they have been thrust into, namely riches to rags but then when you least expect it one of them does something wonderful for each other. This was never more apparent then in Alexis graduation ceremony episode which I found absolutely enchanting.My feeling is that this show is at it's best when it doesn't try too hard. I do enjoy watching some of the unlikability of these people fade away and something of real humanity finally shines through/ It's really the only reason I watch."
449,Thank you for the beautiful show.... Speechless!!!
450,Its awesome bc it doesn't defame the characters on the show it builds them up and shows a community supporting eachother not tearing down. That's why I love it
451,"Similar to the classic Guest/Levy movies, these characters grab your heart and pull you in. A show with groundbreaking writing, it ended at its peak. As heart breaking as that is, it is one of the things that has transformed this show into a classic."
452,"Its a great comedy show, its very funny, you will fall in love with the characters and the show, i want to thank the makers of the show and netflix for bringing this great show to us, i loved it and highly recommend it"
453,"This show is amazing. It has a way to be very funny and keep you kind of on the edge of your seat to know what happens next. Patrick and David were perfect for each other. I know that the guy that plays Patrick is not gay, so man he can act. I would love to be friends with David. He is the life of the party and ready to make you wet your pants with laughter. Kudos on a job WELL done!"
454,"Leave reality out the door to enjoy this marvelous sit com...There are many times when no one is at the Motel desk, a teacher who doesn't teach, a waitress who's always away, the two guys who own their own business are hardly ever around the actual business and one ever is at the Motel except the Rose family. But it's sooo much fun, the couple with the baby are never with the baby.. who cares. The characters more like cartoons but thats the fun of it. Love, love, love Alexis...The actress is great in that role. Whether her character and mannerisms are in the script or did she create them herself ore was it direction. Whatever, Annie Murphy is brilliant. All other cast members are perfect as well.
Sorry to see it end. Congrats to all especially Annie!!!!"
455,"Don't get me wrong, S1 is good too, but it was just an ok sitcom at S1. It became a great one on S2 and better and better as it goes. The characters are very well written, and have discerning personalities, as well it's very much funny, specially when you get to know the characters better."
456,I gave a 9 to the show after finishing season 2 but increased to 10 after the end of the last season. The show improves consistently season over season and its a very hard thing to maintain till till the end. All the actors are brilliant.My favorite storyline was David and Patrick relationship and Alexis growth as a person. I so hope for a spinoff dedicated to David and Patrick love story.
457,"I gave this show a go on a whim and I'm so glad I did! I was hooked the moment Moira started frantically packing her wigs.At first I enjoyed it because the Rose's were just terrible people that it was funny, but as the show goes on, you watch them grow and accidentally settle in and actually thrive in Schitts Creek.There are so many little intricacies that weave a beautiful story, full of jokes and love. I love the love that's in this show. I only have a handful of episodes left and I'm not looking forward to saying goodbye to the Rose family."
458,"I loved this series so much and want to vociferously declare my thoughts and panegyrize (tee hee Moira speak) the creators.. I am a joke snob and I laughed OUT LOUD frequently throughout the 6 seasons. I am Canadian and already adored Eugene Levy and Catherine Ohara from their SCTV days, 2 of my favourite actors for sure (Bobby Bittman & Lola Heatherton, OMG and the soap the Days of the Week). I was lazy and didn't actually have cable so I waited until the series was completely finished and on Netflix to watch it in its entirety. WOW so incredible. I am so thankful to the creators (extra shout out to Dan Levy) and writers and to all of the amazing actors (which are one in the same for some roles) on this show. I truly honestly LOVE the characters and am completely grateful to have experienced such incredible performances. This show is absolutely brilliant, heartfelt, poignant and lovely. THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart for giving us this wonderful, stupendous show. I am SUPER proud and honoured to be Canadian, and therefore loosely affiliated via nationalist kinship with most of the people in the program (haha). Bravo!!"
459,"Brilliant. That's why it has 6 seasons. To those who have rated this with a low score, you obviously can't read characterisation, script, comedic acting - unlike the producers who piled their money into it and reaped rewards/awards. Great show."
460,"I had past up on Netflix until one morning I'd decided to watch the first 3 episodes. Then I was hooked and kept watching until my eyes were burning to get some rest. The next day, I was excited to watch more... I LOVED last episode... Bravo Bravo... This sitcom was well created and excellent actors. Plots were absolutely thought through... More than 10 stars!"
461,"Oh, I loved every bit of this series and binge watched the whole series! The residents of Schitt's Creek are delusional, hilarious, warm-hearted people who play, love and work with people who're different from themselves. I enjoyed how every character lifts others up in their own weird, twisted, sometimes reluctant ways! And I can't get enough of David & Patrick! And David and Stevie's friendship!
Plus, you can't resist enjoying a series in which every actor seems to be enjoying themselves! 🙂"
462,"Oh my the character grow so much on you! And the relationship they build within the show is so heartwarming, how Stevie and Johnny end up having this father-daughter spark is so naturally played! Its all so great"
463,"Its unbelievable how great this series was, after season 1 you begin to get so addicted to the characters and you fall in love with how they develop and its done in such a perfect way where it feels so natural. The art of having such fashion statements behind the background of a murky town is so fascinating. And the light comedic touch to dramatic scenes just plays so well. Truly fantastic 10/10. I'm crying writing this its just so great and you get attached to the characters and learn to love them so much."
464,"I am one of the few who actually started watching after the glowing reviews and awards in 2020. I binge watched, finished it and now in a hangover. There can be spoilers in this review.
Indeed after watching first two episodes I felt, was it the same show that got glowing reviews? and it indeed did not feel like light hearted comedy, rather looked forced, until I did invest into each characters. I would have given 4-5 rating.
From the third episode of first season itself, I was hooked and felt like watching a real family drama with lovable characters. I was about to give 8 rating. The casting was pitch perfect and by the time it came to the sixth season, I wanted to find more about each character. Although I felt bitter that it ended, it would be considered as a classic for future generations. If anyone is looking for a show with subtle comedy with family drama, this is the show for you. I upgraded my rating to 10 after watching the finale episode.
Coming to the performances, Moira and Alexis were my favorite. Moira, with her histrionic antics, wigs, costumes and her vocabulary made the show worth watchable. Alexis, on the other hand had the greatest character development, coming to her career, independence in her life and kind heartedness. Alexis was the best according to me, and felt a bit sad that she did not have the happiest ending considering she always wanted a boyfriend next to her, although she was showed as an independent woman.
David is an excellent with his expressions and antics, and made a believable pair with Patrick. Ted made a wonderful pair for Alexis as well, as their personalities complement each other. Jocelyn and Roland were a riot, although Roland can be annoying at times, so as Ronnie and Bob. Twyla although was kind, felt plain and boring for me. Johnny and Stevie did commendable job as well.
Coming to the conclusion, there will be very few shows that can be watched repeatedly without getting bored and 'Schitt's Creek"" belongs to it. It will be remembered as a classic. So please if you have not watched it, do yourself a favor by watching it once at-least."
465,"This show is a gem. By season 3 they felt like family and now I've finished it, there is a rose shaped hole in my life."
466,This comedic ensemble cast is the best in many years! Very well written & great character portrayal. I only wish they didn't stop at season five!! The Levy's are phenomenal!
467,"I actually found this gem from YouTube snippets. Usually comments in yt are at least partly derogatory, however this show had only positive reviews. So I was intrigued and gave it a shot. I literally haven't stopped watching in every spare moment I have. The show follows a family of 4 (father, mother, son and daughter) who find themselves ripped from obscene wealth to practically nothing. They move out to rural USA, surrounded by folks very different from their rich friends. But it's these folks who take them in and help them transition and grow. The show is smart, witty, salty, delicious, warm and so much fun. The characters are well fleshed out and the actors portray them with such life and depth. The writing is genius. There isn't a single scene or interaction that doesn't make an impact. Even characters that are one episode archs are well written and acted. This show is so genuine that I wish I knew these people for real. I can't say enough about how good this show is. I look forward to what Dan Levy does in the future. Absolutely fabulous."
468,"Two weeks ago, on a sloppy, sad, anxious day, I browsed through Netflix to see whether I could find something new to obsess over- something that'd make me feel good and also make me ugly-cry. But like, with happiness. Or with a sense of disproportionate and overwhelming excitement followed by the realisation that once I finished watching this particular show, I'd have to probably repeat the cycle. Sounds incredibly sad, I'm aware. The next day, I was talking about platonic relationships with my best friend over video call, when she recommended Schitts Creek to me. And what was initially a casual recommendation somehow turned into a daily source of love, light, joy and lessons in goodness, growth, and belongingness.
In a nutshell, this is a story about a filthy-rich family suddenly going bankrupt and having to move to an extremely small town that the father of the family has bought so long ago that they barely remember it exists. And this is how the Pilot starts- with the Roses finding out they've lost everything, and their humorous moving to Schitts Town. The tone, disposition, temperaments of the Roses, including Alexis (the daughter), David (the son), Moira (the mother), and Johnny (the father) is set 4 minutes into the Pilot, and my first initial reaction was that I could NEVER relate to any of these people. At all. The Rose siblings came off as snobby to me, and all through the first few episodes I wondered what it must've been like being raised by Moira. Can't. Relate. Over the course of the first season, you get to know more about the Roses as a family, while also getting acquainted with the (honestly very adorable) residents of the Schitts town. The Roses have gone from living in a gigantic mansion to a tiny motel, and it's all sorts of uncomfortable when you look at what they're dealing with in their individual lives. You're introduced to other important characters, aka Stevie the absolutely badass and amazing receptionist of the motel that the Roses are living at, Roland Schitt (aka Mayor of the town), his wife Jocelyn, Twyla aka a waitress at the only cafe/ restaurant in this tiny town, Ted (aka Alexis' major love interest) and several other characters that add SO much value and weight to the show. And for most part, since it's primarily a sitcom, the tone of the comedy is now established. You'll now be able to recognise these specific, central traits of each character- Alexis' over-the-top travel stories and references to big personalities, Moira's accent and absolutely wonderful fashion, Johnny's efforts at keeping everything together and David's snarky, sarcastic and incredibly well-placed and well-written dialogues and gestures.
The second and third seasons explore more dynamic qualities of these characters- and they do so in the most organic way possible. You know how when you're watching a series and something happens and it irks you to no end because sometimes it feels so unnecessary? Like no thanks, we did not ask for this random plot twist that seems to be there to fulfil only one purpose: carry the show forward. Again, no thanks. And then you watch Schitts, and you watch these characters with their individual quirky and distinctive characteristics, and you see things happening to them because of their personalities and choices, because of who they are and how they are themselves unapologetically, and it is SO impressive. It is so goddamn impressive to see where they direct their lives because ultimately, you get to see how it changes them. How it reveals and exposes their insecurities and their flaws, things about them that seem so humane and so realistic despite the preceding unrelatableness you feel in the first couple of episodes. And at this point, you realise you're now attached to these characters. You're vouching for them, you're cheering for them, and all this while, you're unaware of what's to come.
I was invested till season 3 of course, but nothing would've prepared me for the magic that season 4 is. To get to witness the kind of character arcs that the Roses go through feels nothing short of a blessing, and I think so much of why I'm writing this is because of what the last 3 seasons gave me. Season 4 introduces Patrick, the most grounded, raw, beautifully written character I've seen on a show. And it introduces you to a love that leaves you with tiny goosebumps and smiles and if you're me, the need to rewind certain scenes at least 5 times. Not to mention the genius and subtle tear jerks that are placed SO perfectly throughout season 4,5 and 6. The first point of fascination comes when you start to see Alexis growing, learning how to step outside of her world of comfortable harmony and imagination, pursuing her dreams and becoming who she wants to be. Since I'm trying (poorly, tbh) to keep this a spoiler-free zone, there's one thing I'd like to say- Daniel Levy's writing of Alexis' character in season 6 is legendary writing, and I don't use tissues when I cry but if I had to, I'd probably finish a box. A one hundred percent.
The second point of fascination and inevitable adoration comes with the introduction of Patrick. With the introduction of a healthy, organic, raw, gentle and loving relationship between two queer men. (There, I did it. I couldn't have written this part without the spoilers at all.) In my VERY few years of a consumer of media, I've never necessarily seen healthy representations of romantic relationships. Or maybe I have, but nothing trumps the way love is portrayed on Schitts Creek. Nothing compares to how it feels to see a beautiful relationship between two men grow into something meaningful and something with immense depth, especially when it's not forced. When you see how love factors differently in the lives of each character, you start to understand that it's written differently for each character. The love stories in Schitts Creek aren't the central, distracting storylines. They're not dramatic or exaggerated. In the words of Daniel Levy, they're not there to challenge anything, to make any political statements. They're there to show you a certain way of life- to tell you it exists. It doesn't try to force its opinions or views on you. Instead, this is what it does- It gives you unfiltered joy. It gives you hope. It teaches you vulnerability, and the indescribable feeling of being loved by someone through and despite your insecurities and past. It teaches you that love begets love, good begets good. It teaches you how everyone's love language is different, special, warm, and important. It teaches you how to own yours. It teaches you how to be gentle with love. How to let it in. When it ends, it leaves you with a bubble of warmth and acceptance. A full heart. Inspiration and gratitude. Hope and goodness. An empty tissue box. A snotty, runny nose and a stained inner collar. It has everything- a mind-blowing cast, incredible dialogues, beautiful characters, an engaging plot, an insanely well-written script- a perfectly, thoughtfully and craftily put together package that you never get over once you've opened it. In simple words, it's a delight.
With Schitts Creek creating history with its 7 Emmy wins, the appreciation and recognition that this show has been getting, it makes you realise the power of love. The power of reciprocation and acceptance and warmth.
When Johnny says, ""We're ready, driver"", you realise you're not. You're not ready for it to end, even if it ends exactly the way it must. You're not yet ready to say goodbye. It's simply the best. Better than all the rest.
But oh Schitt, I guess it's life."
469,"A must watch show
Hilarious,touchy,drama,wonderful
Characters just wow
You can't forget something like this after seeing"
470,"Just a great show. Character driven comedy, great acting, and real ensemble piece with nobody trying to steal the show. Got us through the Covid lockdown"
471,Took me sometime to get into the show. But as soon as I understood each characters and their struggles... The show became 'bewitching'. It is a light hearted show but has a surprising depth to the story line. The character arcs develop beautifully well and the ending perfectly ends the show.
472,"First seasons are good but after that it becomes a light soap opera. edit. i was wrong. i watched it all and it was verry good. i did this with Downton Abbey, too. mea culpa."
473,"Really loved the show until Season 4, when it became a vehicle for Dan Levy to explore his sexuality. He was much funnier when he had a more laissez faire attitude about it, ranging from asexual to bi-curious. The rest of the characters are doing yeomen's work, but the show has gradually lost its spark."
474,"Absolutely bloody awesome series. Funny, hilarious, moving, inspired and quotable cult entertainment.You'll fall in love with all of the quirky characters and the actors who play them to perfection and you'll just about pee yourself laughing at their brilliant portrayal.It's the very best feelgood light comedy out there and, like a truly excellent book, you won't be able to put it down once you've started the six complete seasons.A fully deserved 10/10 from me."
475,"I Binged the entire series (Season 1 - 6 ) .
Why did it end ?
The best on the web right now , even in tough times like these , this brought a RAY of HOPE .
Teary Eyed.....
I want this to never end , maybe Rose's will come back again in few years.
Please Dan Levy and Eugene Levy continue this because this thing is weirdly AMAZING !!
WILL MISS THE ENTIRE TOWN ( ROSE'S , SCHITT'S FAMILY SPECIFICALLY) AS I WAS VERY MUCH A PART OF IT.THANK YOU FOR CREATING A GEM.....
GOD BLESS YOU"
476,"I enjoyed this show. I thought the characters were endearing and the comedy was on point. I wish there were more seasons to come.If you're debating watching, watch the pilot (The whole thing) and then decide. The show is consistent and the pilot is one of my favorite episodes."
477,"Well written, hysterical humor. The characters carry each other very well. Highly recommended, good clean comedy very refreshing. It has been years since I've seen a show like this."
478,"I am a huge fan of Eugene Levy and Catherine Ohara so things would have to go off the rails for me not to love this show. Much to my pleasant surprise, it IS HILLARIOUS. Perfect casting, intelligent writing and flawless execution."
479,This is a binge wordy show!!! Love the way these characters are portrayed and grow over the series.
480,"Admittedly, I was a little late to the party with this show, which is odd since I've been a longtime fan of Catherine O'Hara. As it turns out, the entire cast is amazing, as is the writing, directing, everything. Watching this, I've found myself rewinding to scenes that literally made me laugh out loud. Compared to other Canadian sitcoms, Schitts Creek stands alone for its originality and creativity. I will def be watching the entire series again. My only regret is that it's ended."
481,I was late to the party watching this delightful show so I binged five seasons on Netflix. I was sad to see that season six would be it's last and even more upset that I didn't currently have PopTv so I added to my package immediately. I have always loved Eugene Levy (Johnny) and Catherine O'Hara (Moira) ever since SCTV and Best in Show. They have unbelievable chemistry and you can tell they genuinely care about one another. Chris Elliott (Roland) has always been funny and other than those three I had never seen the other cast members before. Except for Dustin Milligan (Ted) who has a small but very memorable part in the movie Extract. I am now in love with Dan Levy (David) and I will watch anything he is a part of in the future. If you haven't watched this show take advantage of being stuck inside and watch it.
482,"I've been watching the show since day 1 and I just have to say, I'm absolutely touched by and in love with this show, the cast and crew and especially the creators. Dan and Eugene Levy did a spectacularly, wonderous and again, beautiful job opening up hearts and showing people how to truly care about one another. How to grow out of your ugliness and become a loving, accepting and open person from the first episode to the beautiful, incredible ending. The documentary is absolutely worth the watch as well. I cried my eyes out.
Thank you so much Dan and Eugene. I miss the show already."
483,"One of the better comedies to come along in a while. However, it's not consistent in that the two children (well, adult children) slowly develop over the course of the series to be fully fleshed-out characters with interesting story lines. The parents never go beyond being caricatures -- they just make the same jokes every episode. But because the kids' arcs are so wonderful, and their relationship histories so convolutedly fascinating, the show really comes alive when it concentrates on Alexis and David. And, Stevie is one of the best creations in any event comedy. Best of all, each episode is only about 20 minutes long, so even several attention-deficit folks like myself can watch without losing interest."
484,Just picked up on this show recently. Binged the six seasons only to learn the finale is this week. Bummer. Gonna miss the entire ensemble.
485,Im always laughing out loud to this show absolutely love it.
486,Catherine is amazing in this. So is the rest of the cast. A must watch!
487,"Daniel Levy is an eloquent speaker & it shows in the pedigree of this shows writing.All cast chemistry is great, part because of the writing and part because of the team of talents.Every ying needs yang, to balance the boat.
Dustin Milligan (Ted), Noah Reid (Patrick) & Eugene Levy (Johnny) are well matched with natural balance, allowing their partners to weigh in with their personalities.Catherine O'Hara similar in my opinion to Jennifer Saunders from tv series, Absolutely Fabulous adds heart & endearment to her character.Co-Creating the show I hope Daniel Levy has a heart as sweet as his character.
Daniel Levy E.M.D (Entertains in Multiple Directions).""Best Wishes / Warmest Regards""A great line containing humour. Reminding me of the cheeky exchange of arms between Riff Raff & Magenta in The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The shows friendship with the character of Stevie is fundamental. Stevie is well natured with relaxed sincerity & neutrality in the life growth of the Rose family.Overall the show is optimism in funny pants 😆"
488,I can't wait to get home to watch this show. I usually can't get enough and watch 2 - 3 episodes a night. I hope it never ends!
489,"My husband and I started watching this on Netflix as we were looking for some lighthearted laughs and are fans of Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy's brand of humor. We binge watched it straight through to season 5 and I can honestly say it's one of the shows with the most heart I've seen in a long time. I love watching the characters connect with each other and learn more about themselves. Lots of corny jokes but that's the point, and the actors pull it off immaculately. Most episodes leave me with a little tear in my eye - such a sweet show!Also, to those trying to compare it to Arrested Development - just, no. Arrested Development (which is also amazing!) didn't focus on character growth and family bonding, it's not a heartwarming show in any way... the unabashed shallowness and self-centeredness of the characters is what makes it so funny. Schitt's Creek takes a very different approach."
490,"This show is so great! The actors are so perfect and spot on in their performances. I've fallen in love with all of them and feel so invested. Sad to see it's ending after season 6, we need more!"
491,"If you like clever use of the English language. Listen to Moira. She's stunning.I get a bit of a ally mcbeal and dawsons creek vibe with the words they use.Mr Rose is fantastic, he brings his awkward American Pie dad into it a bit too which I resonate with. Actually everybody in the show has 90s and 00s references.Alexis is gorgeous character and very perky and beautiful and energetic. I love her and her brother David's hand and body language.Roland and his wife are so funny the way they do everybody's head in.It seems like a nice town to live in with all the banter.I kind of dislike twilah for some reason."
492,"One of the most boring ""comedy"" I have ever seen. What We Do In the Shadows is a THOUSAND times funnier than this big pile of stinking cow doo doo."
493,"We've been Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy fans for many, many years, i.e., ""Waiting for Guffman,"" ""Best In Show,"" etc. Now comes ""Schitt% Creek,"" and even though we had already set the bar very high, this CBC production exceeded any expectations.The Levy family has created a masterpiece, giving their characters our thoughts we were afraid to put into words. They've found the everyman(woman) in all of us and found the edgy part of life this society has become too PC to admit. The result is awesome comedic entertainment, and because you never know when this roller-coaster is gonna leave the tracks, all you can anticipate is a solid 30-minutes (or less) of pure entertainment. Bravo, Levy's and this amazing ensemble!!"
494,My husband and I can't wait to jump in to bed and laugh whatching the show! We love it! Every character is amazing!
495,I heard from the people a lot about how good and amazing this show is. But honestly i tried hard to see so mamy episodes but I couldn't even manage to laugh ONCE. Sorry but this is not a comedy show but something that is there on Netflix which got famous.
496,"This show is hilarious. It reminds me of the days of Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman. (Showing my age) Quirky but so very funny. I'm glad there isn't any laugh track. It is not needed. I'm laughing all through the show without any group letting me know when to laugh. I remember Levy from the movie Dog Show, also a very quirky movie. All the actor/actress' are wonderful. The actor who plays the mayor I remember from Everyone Loves Raymond. I hope this show stays on for many years. It's nice to see a comedy without everyone jumping into bed with whoever. Please don't go that route.It is hard to write the minimum of ten lines. The best two words are hilarious and quirky to describe the show. I view it on POP-TV which I never heard of before. Thank goodness for satellite TV. I've been telling all my friends about the show.Only three more lines to go. I guess I could never be a script writer, I'm more of a few good words type of gal. I will comment of the use of the names that end with Schitt$. That happens to be one of my favorite words. The combinations are very clever. I didn't read any of the negative reviews because I didn't want to spoil my view on it. To each their own. As a side bar, I'm glad POP-TV bleeps out the F word. It gets the point across without having to hear that offensive word. I do find SOB and Schitts very funny though. (Showing my age again.) My DVR is set and ready to record the next episode."
497,"Seasons 1 - 4 were entertaining (with the exception of Chris Elliot). Season 5 and 6 were a bore. I fast-forwarded through Roland's scenes and many with David & Patrick, a couple with zero chemistry. Stevie, Alexis, Johnny & Moira were standouts throughout the entire series, can't say the same for the writing."
498,I find this hilarious but especially moira and her exotic grammar. And having fabulous gay characters tastefully executed by Daniel levy really adds a modern direction and an extra dimension. It's so clever the way you can say hey Mr Schitt as if as normal.
499,"One of the best shows I've seen in a long time! It's creative, funny, and original. I can't stop watching it!"
500,"This is a sweet, brilliant show. It has evolved now through four seasons with a depth and humore unmatched on other shows. It is written by Eugene Levy's son who was a TV star in Canada for many years before this show on MUCH MUSIC. It is cast with the funniest people alive--- CHRIS FREAKIN' ELLIOT. The actress who plays Alexis doesn't have to speak, just watch her face and you will laugh and she deserves an Emmy. The last scene in the first season also deserves and Emmy for Johnathan Rose's speech---wow."
501,"Watched the pilot of this fish-out-of-water series about rich folk who lose everything except a small, run-down town they bought as a joke. It was 22 minutes, I laughed out loud 3 times and chuckled inward a few more times, and generally just found it mild, broad, and predictable. So I didn't bother watching anymore.Years later, after it won a bunch of Emmys, I gave it another chance. The second episode was a little funnier than the first. The third episode had a hilarious scene of Catherine O'Hara haranguing a high school acting class. And buy the end of the first season, those moments of hilarity were common.It's really the women that make this series. Emily Hampshire's snarky Stevie was the one thing I really liked about the first episode and she's a wonderful mix of fragile and tough, Annie Murphy has a uniquely rubbery physical presence (and is also crazy gorgeous) and O'Hara is hilariously awful. On the male side, Dan Levy's David has become better and better (I'm in season 4) and it's also fascinating to see that his rigid physicality is weirdly opposite Murphy's fluidity.The character I like the least is certainly Chris Murphy, who plays the sort of person I would punch if I were the sort of person that punches people. I really wish he'd go away.Anyway, it took me years to really give this series a chance but I'm glad I did."
502,"This is a really funny show! I like the characters and storyline. Lots of laughs and a bit of a ""this is us"" undertone with the family's bond. I just found out that the son and father in the series really is son and father in real life which makes me excited for the next season to release. I'm a nutshell, this show was a happy accident for me as I'd stumbled across it here recently and I really like this series!"
503,This show is funny! Give it a chance. We are binge watching and just started 2nd season. I'm glad to see it's coming back for a 5th season
504,"Simply put- comedic and even a little dramatic- genius! I have never become so invested in characters as I have with this show. It is so well done, just when I think I've watched the best episode they outdo themselves. The Levys touch on so many subjects and each one is done in such a deep and thoughtful way and while you may be laughing out loud while watching there is such a meaningful and touching tone lying just beneath the surface. It is rare to see such a talented cast of characters in one show- I have grown to appreciate and look forward to more from each one. The Tina Turner scene is by far one of the best things I have ever seen on any screen- I was frozen in place watching it and didn't want it to end- I felt every second of it and have replayed it countless times! I look forward with much anticipation to the next season BRAVO!"
505,"For the name alone, Schitt's Creek, I expected this series to be funny, but add to that Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara as two of the main actors, and it became a ""no-brainer"" . But the most brilliant character on this show, is David, portrayed by Dan Levy! He is more than enough reason for me to binge watch this series. And the dynamic between David and Stevie, played by Emily Hampshire, is something that I have never seen on any other television series, and it never fails to have me rewinding because I'm laughing so hard that I miss the next lines they say to each other. The writing is witty and sarcastic, and is delivered perfectly by these two characters. But in all fairness, every actor's character in this series has been cast, and is played, brilliantly! In Season 2, I appreciated the way the siblings evolved, became less shallow and selfish and started thinking about the family as a whole, but still kept that snarky bickering between themselves. This is a funny, refreshing, and unique series that I can already tell will have me watching all over again when it's finished. 
Hurry up Netflix and give us Season 4! 
And for all of the nay-sayers and bad-review givers, I recently read that Pop TV has renewed it for a Season 5! Guess that shows how the smart and savvy watchers of this series pay no attention to bad reviews! Give it a watch, you won't regret it."
506,"Without the use of laughtrack by most sitcoms, Schitts Creek offers a unique story that starts off a little slow but really starts to pick up pace as the seasons progress. Canadian tv isn't often well known or even known for their content but Schitts Creek makes the cut for me."
507,"Wonderful cast... quirky and sweet!
Daniel Levy has been a longtime favorite. This is the first show I binge watched. I just love the entire cast. Great job!"
508,I really don't understand the low reviews I love this show!
509,"Schitt's Creek is a very unique sitcom, and judging from the reviews, isn't for everyone. But, I find most sitcoms that are wildly popular to be positively dreadful. So if the standard fast-paced, tie up all loose ends each episode, laugh track-filled TV comedy is more your style, this might not be your cup of tea. But not because it isn't funny. Schitt's Creek is hysterical. Most of the negative reviews I've read are worried about ""How someone buys a town,"" or ""the over top gay son is annoying."" Newsflash: he's supposed to be annoying and the details of how they ended up there doesn't have to make sense, it's a sitcom. The show is well written and superbly acted. Chris Elliott is fantastic as usual, as are Catherine O'Hara, Eugene Levy, and his real life daughter and son. There are moments that are terribly uncomfortable, behavior that is universally unacceptable, only a rare occasional touching moment, and the main characters (the Rose family) are utterly self absorbed and almost without redeeming qualities. Many of the townies they encounter are just as bad, in their own, more crude ways. It's not a formula that's never been done before, we've seen this theme from Green Acres to Arrested Development. But Schitt's Creek does ""formerly wealthy people out of their element"" fantastically. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll cringe, and you'll have a new favorite show. Or perhaps you'll be in the percentage of people who are inexplicably enraged by it. For me, it's easily my favorite comedy in the last several years."
510,I don't understand what people like about this show. It just seems like an Arrested Development rip off to me. The characters aren't like able and the idea of being rich and losing all your money isn't relatable.
511,"It takes a couple of episodes to really get into this series, but when you do, it is just a riot. The characters are really well developed, but they never cease to amaze you with where they go next. The acting of every character is really excellent, and the writing is very sharp, very witty. Not surprisingly, it is like SCTV in a full series, so instead of a skit, you get a storyline. If the storyline itself seems a little strained, get beyond it. It is a huge, and very well done, parody on just about anything you can think of: actors, the wealthy, small town folk, gays, ditsy debutante. I can't wait for the next season to start, but meanwhile I am catching up on Netflix"
512,"What a refreshing change from the pap usually on TV. Daniel Levy is great at playing a nervous, self-absorbed character, of the type I've met in real life too many times. Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy are wonderful as usual. Both are subtle, involved and deep into their characters. A strong cast rounded out with Chris Elliot, Jennifer Robertson and Annie Murphy - with a special mention for Emily Hampshire as the bemused and sarcastic motel clerk. Elliot typically plays the obnoxious, too-close-to-your-face buffoon, but this time it's so well placed and played, it seems completely necessary for the plot. Well-written with great dialog, including the many under-the-breath statements we all make and hear in our daily lives. Excellent editing, too. If you're expecting (or hoping for) a typical Big 4 Network sitcom, with laugh track and vapid characters delivering vapid writing, then you'll be disappointed with this show. It's clever, delicious, and a breath of fresh air. I even like the color-correction! In a way, this reminds me of the old sitcom, ""Action"" starring Jay Mohr, from about 15 years ago, in the sense that it's a total break from television convention. Encore, please!"
513,I just started watching this show within the last couple weeks. I finished season 2 today and this show is amazing. David and Stevie are my favorites.
514,"I'm not surprised at the mixed reviews here. This show isn't for everyone; the humor is subtle and the characters (or should I say ""caricatures"") are outrageous yet nuanced. 
Catherine O'Hara is superb, reminding me of the stellar part she played in ""Beetlejuice."" 
Well-written and well-cast, this little gem is definitely binge-worthy. 
It's a light-hearted comedy full of laugh-out-loud moments. 
It's definitely a nice break from more serious fare. You just have to lighten up to appreciate it."
515,"Not sure where the negative reviews are coming from but I absolutely love this show! I love Dan Levy (he is my favorite), and every single one of the characters plays their parts to perfection!"
516,This show is a game-changer. One of the best comedies of all time. I've watched all of the seasons a couple times and it never gets boring. Amazing cast! Superb writing!
517,"Took me an episode or two to get into it but once I did, I absolutely loved it. I've laughed so much.. I even cried in the latest season.. it's wonderful and worth a shot"
518,"Gene Levy and Catherine O'hara Are getting a lot of recognition for this show, and rightly so. I just want to say My favorite scenes are the ones with David (Dan Levy) or Stevie (Emily Hampshire). They hit every note spot on comedically."
519,Every show has me giggling and wanting to remember lines so I can say them in future conversations.
520,SIMPLY AMAZING. I love everything about this show. Dan Levy is a genius and the rest of the cast is divine. I really can't say enough good things about it. I hope it never ends.
521,"I hope this show sticks around for a very long time. This is the first time I've taken the time to write a review, because I don't want this to lose this gem. The writing and characters are so unique. I haven't laughed this hard since my favorite comedy film, Young Frankenstein. The Levy's are brilliant. More please."
522,"My husband and I don't usually watch shows where you would need to wait an entire week to find out what happens next but he recorded a few episodes to see if we'd like it. Surprisingly, we were instantly hooked! Sadly, thinking we recorded the whole season we actually missed next/this week's season finale and now have to wait and wait. Ukh, no patience here!!We love this show! The characters are quite unique as well as the story line/plot itself, its definitely not the same old garbage show. The show is pretty funny if you're smart enough to understand it and/or enjoy this kind of sarcastic humor. It seems like most 'comedy' these days has become cheap, dirty or idiotic - but not this show."
523,"Wonderful characters. This show shows us that no matter what economic circle, there are always those who lead and those who achieve. Amazingly dark humor that is delivered with impeccable timing."
524,Hilarious and sometimes even a bit touching. Great binge watch!
525,Well I turned on SC on Netflix I was intrigued right away. Of course a fan of the 2 senior actors I noticed their timing with the two younger actors (who play their kids) seemed flawless. So real so comfortable. The humor is fun and then the stories I could relate too if I was in their situation. Then of course the diversity in sexuality was captivating. Of course I have copied some of the fashions in my wardrobe! Hooked early and drool till the next show happens!
526,I am so glad I found this show! I watch and rewatch every episode. Great humour and perfect cast. The wardrobes of David and Moira are odd but match their personalities. Stevie is great...she's my idol
527,"I was not reading any reviews, I just watched the first episode and I can't stop myself.
There are so many average shows out there today, that finding a true jam like this makes me feel great.
Funny, dry, witty, hilarious all of it and more!
Must watch!!!"
528,This is one of the best but unknown shows on TV. Laugh out loud jokes every episode. But keep watching as it develops the characters and relationships over time.
529,"Just started watching this show not long ago and I love it! It's so funny and sarcastic/dry humour which I love. I love all the characters, good storyline and every episode has made me laugh. It is such an underrated show.. David is my favourite but TBH they all are. I love the fact that it doesnt have a laugh track!! I find them annoying ans don't watch a comedy that has one. It doesn't need one. Any show that has a laugh track past the 90s just shouldn't. I'm all caught up and yet to make it through an episode without laughing. 10/10."
530,"Seriously, the seasons keep getting better. I'm already looking for Moira Rose t-shirts. If you need a new show. Watch this! The first couple episodes take a moment to digest, but then you will be hooked. I watch it before bed nightly. Bravo to the Creek!"
531,"There are parts where I definitely laughed, and the characters have interesting comical personalities.Yet you'll find your laughs more along the lines of ""slightly blowing wind out of your nose"" rather than funny-funny.I watch it in the background while I'm texting people on WhatsApp and checking insta"
532,Most of the local men in this show are waaaayyyy too good looking to be believable as hicks. But the main actors are so good you have to love it.
533,Glad I watched this show. I tried originally but didn't go far. Then it won all the Emmy awards. Really hilarious
534,Eugene and Dan are phenomenal... Catherine is superb... Easy watching and gripping and funny as... no regrets in binging
535,"This series is a must-watch! It's so good. I love the town and the people soo much. This town is soaked in the feeling of togetherness, love, harmony, and what not. The natives of the town are funny and mind their own businesses. They get a peek of the outside world through the Rose family. The Rose family subtly realises the important things that they had been ignoring in their previous lavish life, and this town acts as a metaphor. A town that is inhabited by genuine people is the most happy. The people in the town are weird because they are real and genuine. The Rose family realises that they have been fake with each other when they arrive at the town and it's here where they accept each other's broken selves."
536,Fun and heartwarming. I enjoyed watching this for what it is!!
537,"I can't even tell how beautiful this show & characters are, best part was about the situations they are put into and decisions they make for it, absolute brillant and a must watch show fir everyone"
538,I have never posted a review before but just had to say that every episode is a delight!
539,"I just wanna say thank you.
Thanks for making me laugh and cry, but always happy tears.
I'm gonna miss you, guys"
540,This series has so much heart and clever humour. Amazing acting from the main cast. A true gem!
541,"Amazing seasons! Going to miss it.
Great cast,storylines,costumes,directing & cinematography.
Worth checking out,if you havent."
542,It's a slow grower but the characters are awesome. All make it what it is
543,I am fairly new to this series. It came recommended to us when we got Netflix. We absolutely LOVE this show! It is so well-written and the actors are fantastic. The first season I laughed the entire season. Looking forward to catching up to the current season.
544,"I didn't care for the idea at first. I love a lot of the films with Eugene Levy in it but I imagined that a whole show of Levy's would be too much. I was wrong. Very wrong. I love this show. The acting in it... especially after season one is phenomenal. I love the relationships. They are not focused on what makes them different but what makes them normal and real. I haven't cheered this much for a couple in a long time. Anyhow, can't wait for the next season to come to Netflix."
545,"Someone told me about this show, it sounded dumb, but I gave it a try. Wow!! It's amazing!!! A must watch. It's relevant, funny, and well rounded."
546,"There are plenty of shows that I find funny, but a rare few that make me laugh out loud without effort (among them The Office, Parks & Rec).I'm admittedly a big, big fan of Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara back to the SCTV days, and their work in Christopher Guest's mockumentary films, and I think the fact they've worked together for such a long time is one of the reasons I love this show so much, their comedic timing reminds me of some of the great pair-ups from the Golden Age of Hollywood, impeccable.I'm Canadian as well, but this series touches on such universal themes that I'd recommend this to anyone no matter where they are from or what life circumstances. Laughing at this show I'm also laughing at my own humanity and all the foibles that go along with it."
547,"This show is all kinds of genius and will always make me laugh. Cringed a little when friends recommended it to me as it didn't sound particularly appealing, but wow, was I wrong!!"
548,"I had heard about this show from others but hadn't checked it out because frankly sitcoms bore me. Well it was a quiet Thanksgiving so I decided to give it a shot. I'm on the lastest season and totally awestruck by this show. Kudos to Eugene and Daniel Levy for a funny, touching show. Never a fan of Chris Elliott, here he actually has a decent role. The rest of the cast are simply superb and pitch perfect for their roles. Catherine O'Hara is terrific as Eugene Levy's wife. They make a formidable team. So worthy....everyone and a special shoutout to Jennifer Robertson..one of my most favorite characters. A show not to be missed."
549,"This show is amazing. Dan Levy shines in an amazing cast, and he and his father also write the show! Where has this man been before this? Brilliant."
550,Put off watching this show forever because I wasn't convinced I was going to like it. So glad I gave it a try because I'm hooked now. This show is really funny and clever. It has great characters. The best is David the son. He has great comic timing. I can't stop watching this show. I've been binging it since I started a few days ago and I'm already on season 3. Even my husband likes it and he's hard to please.
551,"I have been binge watching this delightful show for a few days and I'm almost done the fifth season. Eugene Levy (John Rose) and Catherine O'Hara (Moira Rose) are amazing actors and they both shine as the once very rich heads of the Rose family. Dan Levy (David Rose) and Annie Murphy (Alexis Rose) play the very clueless and spoiled adult Rose children. Dan (David) is Eugene's son in real life which you can't miss as they look exactly alike. The Rose family loses everything and they are forced to move to the small town of Schitt's Creek and live in the town's only motel. David and Alexis are both tools when they first move to Schitt's Creek but it's nice to watch them evolve into actual human beings by the fifth season. Moira is the only family member who hasn't really changed much since arriving in town but the fact that she thinks she has makes her even funnier. Chris Elliott is so funny as the dumb as a box of hair mayor of the town, Roland Schitt."
552,"After season 6 is out in January I'm really going to miss not having a next season to look forward to. While I'll admit that it took a few episodes for me to get into this show during that first season, now that we are about to be viewing the final season I am so bummed that it's almost over. Both Levys & O'Hara are just masterful in this. It took me those first few episodes to ""get"" Dan Levy's wit and timing down, but once I did his scenes (after O'Hara's anyway) are my favorite to watch. Bravo!"
553,"Excellent writing, great characters. Funny and heartwarming and a joy to watch."
554,"Loved this series. I have watched it twice now and enjoyed the second time more. Quirky funny with such cool characters, strong leads which is rare.
The humour is dry and ""upper class"" if that makes sense. They lived sheltered lives then became poor. Living in a dumpy old motel in a crap town. But eventually they grow strong relationships with each other for the first time, which is nice to see. The trouble they get in is entertaining to say the least. And best of all I didn't find it predictable at all!
Great writing Dan and Eugene"
555,"The Levy family smash this sitcom and have you just waiting for the predicable comedy to land. Wonderful cast and a great example of how when talent is given freedom to deliver their vision. This is what Netflix and other growing providers do so well! Shame it ends but great they end it with a conclusion not a cancellation leaving you frustrated, like so many series these days I fall I love with."
556,"This show was recommended to me as light watching, but omg I actually love it. The characters are all perfectly cast and I am in LOVE with Dan Levy.It's a comedy for everyone. No prejudice on the sex of characters. It's the best"
557,Starts a little slow but quickly becomes your new favorite show. Perfect cast and so fun to watch
558,"I'm looking forward to more seasons. I love who the characters have become. It's a good series and should be added to your watch list. Some scenes are cringe-worthy, but I do like the fish out of water story-line"
559,"Perfect casting, acting and writing. I cannot think how this could be shy better!"
560,"Love love this show, the lip sync by David was the best!"
561,"I have enjoyed this show greatly! It is brilliant in its character development. None of the characters remain the shallow entitled snots they were when they arrived. I almost stopped watching after the first episode because I was not interested in hour after hour of rich folks trying to make themselves less miserable. But that was not what the show became. It is rich entitled people learning how the other 90% live and learning to respect that.
And to be honest, I am not a fan of Chris Elliot. I find his style of humor kinda gross. But even his character becomes likable, which I have NEVER said about a Chris Elliot character before.
Also I now cannot say enchilada the correct way ever again. GREAT SHOW!!!"
562,"This is a gem of a show! Great writing, and the acting is on point. David is hilarious. Moira and her wit. You can't go wrong with Eugene Levy as the dad here. If you haven't watched it, I'm not sure what you're waiting for..."
563,"This piece is a gem. It is dry and subtly very funny. The characters develop as you watch the series. The parents are particularly funny. I think this would suite anyone who likes dry, off-the-wall type humour. Even though it is Canadian, it has alot of parallels with British sitcoms. Great watching. My cup of tea for sure. Thank you"
564,I like it. Sort if like a soap too 😆 Real and funny at the same time.
565,Started watching with no expectations. But now I am happy to say it's one of the best ones out there.
566,"With many characters playing the same roles that they played in past roles is genius. The funniest live show today, I can't watch it late night because I laugh so hard I wake everyone up. My sister and I can't stop acting like the characters. How can you not love this show? Johnny the dad, David the brother and Stevie that works at the hotel are real brother, sister and father. This show is straight up hilarious."
567,"The first few episodes, my thought was that the show was amusing, but not super funny. But I continued to watch-thank goodness!!-because it wasn't long before I was laughing out loud and loving every second!! Each character is amazing and the growth and changes in the characters are so real and fantastic!! I recommend the show to everyone!!! I never want it to end!!"
568,Quirky and so awesome. Love it. I wasn't sure of it after just watching the first episode. Glad I went to the second and third. I'm hooked This show is something I will repeatedly watch and continue to enjoy and laugh.You're being cheated if you don't watch this one.
569,"T's funny, witty, and amazing. I will continue to watch and tell people about how awesome this show is."
570,"Season 1 started off a bit too much.. but as you get to know the characters you will recognize how people in general never really dare to speak their god honest minds, because we don't want to hurt someone's feelings, but we also want to get exactly what we want for ourselves! This show is just a waterfall of situations like this! I just love it!"
571,Love love love love this show is amazing and beautiful!
572,wish I could keep track of when the show is on. I never heard of the cable channel POP and don't even know what other shows are on. I enjoy comedy shows but something like Two broke girls I find vulgar. I laugh watching Schitts Creek. not familiar with the Levy family but they get my TEN vote. friends from las Vegas flew in for visit last month. we know each other almost 50 years. I asked what they wanted to watch on TV and they said to look and see if Schittzs creek was on because it is their favorite television snow. I told them I had the last four episodes recorded. we watched two hours and never stopped laughing. FYI....yes we are all senior citizens ....I don't think the show is looking for an old timers market but most of us have a good sense of humor.
573,"4/9/18. What an absolutely hilarious sitcom! I enjoyed all 3 seasons of this series, and look forward to #4, which I heard just got green-lit. This is like a reverse of The Beverly Hillbillies, and in the vein of Green Acres. An extremely spoiled rich family must learn to make a living after Johnny Rose (Levy) loses his business and all the money that went with it. Now his wife (O'Hara), a has-been actress who has seen much better days, and their two extremely spoiled adult children (Murphy and Levy) must eke out a living at Schitt's Creek. Definitely catch this series!"
574,"It's funny, it's witty, it's sarcastic. I can't get enough of it, I had to binge watch it. All the characters are funny in their own way, and watching you can feel they all get along and work well together. These are easy to watch, shorter then 30 minute episodes."
575,"I may of commented in the past, and i have not seen every episode but it is over the top comedy not like so many others that are so predictable , dan levy brings an over top kind of comedy as you just dont know what will happen next.he is a name i had not heard of before . I just saw a clip of him on etalk canada talking about this show it was entertaining he is hilarious which just adds to this show
you get a chance watch the show , all shows can have a bad episode dont let that stop you , catherine ohara a name and artist i have seen in many things from home alone on and she also is just hilarious on this over the top
thanks for the laughs"
576,"Thanks to CBC for producing such an amazing show. Its been many years since I have followed any tv show with such anxious enthusiasm.
 Very well acted and written. I hope this show stays on the air for many years to come. Love, love, love, it ! Keep up the great work."
577,"Every show - the faces of Dan Levy, the little ""eeewwww"" from ""his sis"", Eugene, Catherine....Keep this show on forever. I never watch TV, or comedy because it is such pathetic jokes. You can tell all of the actors ad lib, the little quips, it is dry, witty humour. I remind me of good British comedy. This show makes me proud to be a Canadian. Everyone I ask in Canada loves this show so ignore the dense comments and keep doing what you are doing. People with half a brain ""get"" this show."
578,"We stumbled upon this show after the first season and it quickly became the family favorite. I have ran through the comments wondering how people cannot find this show hilarious (I can only assume they find shows like the Piano, Mother, and A Ghost Story interesting and Oscar worthy). If you find any of the aforementioned movies ""good"" in any way shape or form then definetly something named ""Schitts Creek"" will not be on your list to watch. If you find shows like The Goldbergs Modern Family entertaining then this show is up your alley"
579,"Funny, sweet, cant get enough. It does take giving it a chance but now I'm hooked. The characters are all really insane and funny. I wouldn't change anything so far. It appears to be really superficial at first glance so you have to give it a chance but once you do there is so much more to it than what your first impression is."
580,I can't get enough of this show. It is so funny. The dry humor has me laughing out loud. I love everyone but my favorite has to be the mom and the sister.
581,"My brother recommended this show to me whilst I was visiting. I was first hesitant when I saw the title and that I had not heard of it, plus I'm not a big TV watcher, series, etc... But... wow! The character interaction, the cast chemistry, the dry humor, the dialog, unreal. Camera work, setting, plot, all works well. One episode, I was hooked, watched the whole series in 3 days, haven't been this hooked since Breaking Bad (and we all know how that went) This show is hilarious, ridiculous, outstanding. Keep on writing this! Bring on 5 seasons! Expand the viewing area! You hit pay-dirt! I commend the writers, producers and actors on a great show, you never know when you score, but I think you did."
582,"Where are the bad reviews coming from??? I don't know about anyone else but I LOVE this quirky comedy. 😊 I just so happened to stumble upon it searching through Netflix and figured meh I'll give it a shot. I couldn't stop watching it, went through the whole first season in one night. I think it's a wonderful, laugh out loud, little engine that could type of show & I hope to see more and more. I think people today are too obsessed with big production and special effects or what have you. This is simply just actors playing their characters, and I for one say give it a chance. I do wish they had more publicity though as I had never heard of it before last night. Don't listen to the nay Sayers, tune in and decide for yourself just what a fabulous Canadian produced show can look like. Can't wait for season 2, I hope more & more people discover this gem😊"
583,"It took to about mid way through the second season before this show really found its tone, and it's brilliant. The closest thing I can compare this to is a 1930s screwball comedy, only updated with a modern sensibility. The humor and tone is very sophisticated, despite the seemingly tired fish-out-of-water premise, because the writers never go for the most obvious or expected joke or if they do, they subvert it. The show had developed its storylines and characters very impressively, and you genuinely end up caring about the Rose family and their friends. The Alexis storyline is better than most recent romantic comedies, especially when the show decided to make nice guy Ted her true love and her having to become a better person to win him. Back in the 1930s, she would have wound up with gruff Mutt without having to become a better person and the nice guy would have been discarded.It's also lovely to see queer David get his own romantic comedy plot and the banter between him and Patrick is sharp and funny. I am really looking forward to seeing how these stories move forward in Season 5. It's also sweet to see their parents, Johnny and Moira, have stayed in love despite their change in status. It's really funny, it respects its audience and it is often surprising, too."
584,"We laugh at every episode until tears roll from our eyes! Have never seen a funnier sitcom on TV, ever, ever, ever! If you need a good laugh to brighten your spirits, this is a quick pick me up for you! Eugene Leavy and Catherine O'Hara never fail as a funny duo. This is simply one more in there long history of acting together. The writing is original, the cast is great, and the delivery of lines is spot on hilarious! Eugene and his son are off to a great start with their new father son danger. We can hardly wait to see more from this duo, as well as the rest of this fantastic cast. Season two can't come out fast enough!"
585,"Am I the only one who finds this show almost unwatchable? I really don't care if I am, cause I don't get it and what I mean by that is I don't get the hype, this show is filled with unlikable characters and not one funny or amusing situation in it! I do love almost all the lead actors Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara and Chris Elliot......so I thought I'd like it but I'd rather be up schitts creek than have to suffer through watching it!"
586,Please don't end this show soon! It continues to surprise me every seasons and the fourth one was just perfect!
587,"The comedy style is LOL funny, love the Levi duo! I binged watched season 4 and totally cried at the end! Love all of the characters!!"
588,"Seasons 1 thru 4 are very funny. Season 5 has it's moments of lol, but it just seems to have more depth than laughs. One of the characters majorly transformed in this season, and it was a delight to experience. This show is unique and wonderful. One more season. Sad to see it go, but that's ok, I will just binge reruns whenever I need an uplift to my day."
589,"Characters are a perfect match. Hilarious...I'm hooked! I find myself binge watching and seriously laughing-out-loud. Love, love the humor. Please do not let it ever end : )"
590,"I've just discovered this show on Netflix after hearing about it 2 years ago. It's surprisingly clever and laugh-out-loud funny at times. Each character is developed uniquely, which is always a sign of quality. And for Americans, don't worry, it's not too Canada at all. Daniel Levy writes the episodes and brilliantly acts as the son of the riches to rags family. What a talent he is! The plots are simple but when you expect the usual outcome, it smartly goes the other way. O'Hara's character as a former soap opera diva is a Xanax-popping dream of hilarity. I resist binge-watching the series because I want it to last. Fortunately it's filming another season. I've turned on 3 people who've already watched it all and LOVE it. This is a rare gem well worth watching."
591,"This show is probably not for everyone. It's corny at times, but it really is hilarious."
592,"This is the funniest thing since 'Soap'. It's contemporary, clever and surprising. Kudo's to Catherine O'Hara, and Eugene Levy, the two of them together is watching classic comic delivery and timing. Daniel certainly got his dad's talents and looks to boot!. Anne Murphy is the perfect (Paris Hilton type), Emily Hampshire is a delight, and Jennifer Robertson is perfect as the small town good girl. Sarah Levy is freckled faced honest sincere! You all should be so proud of your production, it has brought me so much happiness. I have NEVER laughed so hard and so loud. My neighbors are beginning to talk!!!!! Thank-you"
593,"I couldn't possibly love anyone more than I do Catherine O'Hara, whose characterizations of ""Dusty Towns,"" and ""Lola Heatherington,"" as well as her brilliant impressions of Elizabeth Taylor, Jane Fonda, and Katharine Hepburn lit up Second City. Here she costars with another member of the hilarious Second City team, Eugene Levy, in ""Schitt's Creek,"" also starring Dan Levy, Annie Murphy, Emily Hampshire, Chris Elliott, and Jennifer Robertson.A wealthy, spoiled family loses everything and winds up in a town they own, Schitt's Creek, living in the local motel. The mother, Moira, is a former soap opera star. Her wall has an assortment of wigs on it; she speaks in an affected voice. The son, David, is Dan Levy, probably gay, who has outrageous taste; his sister, Alexis, is a total airhead who never finished high school; and the head of the family, Johnny, tries to keep them all in line while looking for a way to make some money.Witty, dry, sarcastic, dark, with a core of warmth, this show is a no-miss. It's quirky and fresh with no laugh track. So wonderful to see two Second City stars again."
594,"I enjoyed this show so much. I like to watch shows that make me feel good after watching them and this show does that. The characters feel like family. The writing is clever and reminds me of the golden age of television when creativity was its own reward. Issues such as sexuality are not thrown in your face like other shows have done. If a character is gay or bi-sexual or etc. it is not the issue of the show and people's life choices are their own. Stevie is adorable eye candy and can be adorable in tom girl clothes which is amazing. The Levys make the show and the supporting cast are top notch as well. Somehow I was not disgusted by Chris Elliott and his character came across as human and not a mystical one as he has been in other shows, the little hand! Outstanding writing and excellent production and cast selection makes this series a must see up there with Arrested Development. Watch every episode, I recommend it."
595,"Just one of the best shows ever. I binge watch everytime a new season comes on. I am 67 years old and found this highly entertaining. Its quirky and the acting is just brilliance. Catherine O'Hara is nothing like this character her accent and the way she looks and acts is shear brilliance. Dan Levy as David Rose is inspiring, I just fell in love with his character and so did my daughter. She has watched this series about 4 times now. Well it just never grows tired. There are a lot of things going on in it which you can miss. The humour can be quite subtle its not in your face, but some of the lines are simply classic.Alexis Rose her character slowly blossoms into a really likeable person with humour and lots of emotions. I just want her to find herself a man and settle down. The hidden gem too for me is Stevie Budd played by Emily Hampshire. I cant wait to see more of her character. She is so dry you could use her for sand paper tongue in cheek humour lol. Yep another one of my favorites. You have to give it a chance, dont judge it by the first few episodes, stick with it you wont be disappointed."
596,"So if she liked, it must be funny. So my husband and I started watching, and now we're hooked! It's a combination of dry, dark humor. Love it!!"
597,Not bad starting to like it worth a watch. Do like were it's going and even the daughter with her boy boobs is hot... The motel clerk is the hottest one in it by far
598,"Sort of like a bad car accident while we drive by we just can't take our eyes off of it. No, not every episode of Schitt's Creek is hilariously funny, but neither were the 1960's Beverly Hillbillies, or Green Acres which are both well past their TV prime time but remain in TV history through reruns and DVD sales.I must say that Schitt's Creek is refreshing for the past few years and is now thriving in season 4 as we have gotten to know the ecclectic towns people. What I really, really appreciate about Schitt's Creek and each and every episode is the producers have refrained from utilizing that irritating ""canned hah hah hah hah laughter"" that so dominates many of the so-called comedy TV series that are on today.Schitt's Creek and the Rose family, comprised of father Johnny Rose (Eugene Levy), classy over dressed wife Moira (Catherine O'Hara), prissy daughter Alexis (Annie Murphy), and gay son David (Dan Levy) share equal time on the screen with the rest of the cast that include the seedy motel Manager Stevie Budd (Emily Hampshire), local restuarant waitress named Twyla Sands (Sarah Levy), the Mayor of Schitt's Creek Roland Schitt (Chriss Eliott), gay town councillor Ronnie Lee (Karen Robinson), and David Rose's love interest and business partner Patrick (Noah Reid) to name but a few of this great cast of townsfolk who live and work in Schitt's Creek.This comedy series is especially more enjoyable when you can binge watch several episodes at the same time to get a good feeling of how well blended the cast and story lines are. Don't be offended by the series title as so many IMDB naysayers have utilized to prematurely poor cold water on the series. This series stays away from any political message and is deliberately very inclusive with its cast of characters. I need not say anymore as this series speaks for everyone, not just a select audience.No canned laughter allows Schitt's Creek to stand for what it is, great comedy with an ecclectic cast with refreshing funny storylines that will surely be around for a few more seasons.I give this comedy series a bright 8 out of 10 rating"
599,Love this tv show and the entire cast. Can't wait for season 5! Catherine o'Hara is awesome in season 4.
600,"Every episode is hilarious. Always making me laugh. Great cast, funny episodes!"
601,"Reading through reviews on here, I decided to pitch in with my own. It seems that for this show, you'll either love it or hate it. This show isn't everyone's cup of tea. It is a slow-paced comedy, so don't expect anything else. The characters are well played and developed. The best episode for me was the one with the town sign, and I seriously couldn't stop laughing. That being said, this show has it's moments. It doesn't feed you with jokes after jokes after jokes like The Big Bang Theory. Jokes in this show are more subtle and understated.All in all, it's not my favourite show, but I enjoy watching it. Hopefully season 2 will have some good moments."
602,So finally got round to binge watching this and yeah it okay but to really honest I let so many episodes pass by just listening to audio it's very repetitive and in my opinion yep humble one not worthy of all the fuss that finally lead me to watching it. I think over 6 series I had 2 LOL moments the best being in the first couple with the schitts creack signpost .I'm not saying its terrible but I've not long since been rewatching arrested development and this is not in same league.There is a special I might watch later
603,"Why would anyone intentionally cast Chris Elliot?
He is an one dimensional untalented hack
You can do better Hollywood"
604,"Dont get me wrong i totally love the series,funny family,awesome, characteristic
But the end i awefull.if i make some suggestions the family should be stay in town without leaving.breaking up of ted and alaxis is Very bad.you should keep them together forever.Love the series.hate how it ends."
605,Schitts CreekThe lot seasons 1 - 6Loved it!This show is one of those rare occasions when it excellence surpasses criticism.
606,"I really thought this was going to be a bad fish out water ""comedy"" with a worst laughtrack. However, this show has unexpected sweetness and heart. It doesn't make fun at the expense of any of it's characters or small town life. There's not a mean bone in the show's body. The family interactaction seem real and, no wonder, as real-life father, son, and daughter are featured.I found this on Netflix and binged and was delighted to find new episodes are available on network TV. Do yourself a favor and watch this."
607,"I love this show! The cast is amazing together! I feel like I'm a part of the family! So funny!
The mom makes me laugh...she's soooo 'extra'.
And my favorite is, well....the whole family is my favorite!
Funny story lines that continue from one show to another, great flow!"
608,"It is such a charming, clever and funny show! The characters growing is heartwarming rebuilding their lives as well as their relationships."
609,"I have been watching Eugene Levy and Katherine O'Hara for years and years going back to Waiting for Goffman..or even before! These people are so funny, outrageous, whacky and just geniuses at what they do!! And they never stop doing it! You know parts of the show - a lot of the show, sometimes, are ad libbed. You can usually tell once you watch them for a while! This is a good time for my husband and I to watch Schitt's Creek as he is having hip replacement surgery next week!!"
610,"I clicked the link to read some of the critic's reviews. They were harsh! If I had given up after two or three episodes I wouldn't have rated it highly either. But I tell you, these characters grow on you! Once they start inadvertently revealing their vulnerabilities they become likable and funny. The family members are all great, but Catherine O'Hara is just amazing! As always! Chris Elliot is funny sometimes although he has a tendency to go overboard. The rest of the supporting cast is really good. Just funny and enjoyable."
611,"I started watching this on Metflix and was instantly hooked. It's crazy, witty, and laugh out loud. Something about the characters hooked me They are so over the top but have an unexpected sweetness that makes you love them! Just binged season 5 - so sad there's only one more season."
612,"This show is my favorite, it's so much fun to watch. I love how it just makes me happy. I hope to see many more seasons and watch each character grow."
613,Ever since the last the BBT I've been looking for something to get a laugh and I've found it even the cast seems to enjoy their work.Well done all.
614,Funniest comedy series in years! Incredible characters!
615,This is beautifully done ...tongue in cheek well written never irksome gratuitous smutty and quite simply adorable. Gorgeous Mutt has spoiled me for all other guys tho so there's that ...kill me. Fave character is the dad but they're all so good and its a close call 😆😉😊😋😎😍😘 thanks for this hilarious gem.
616,This show is extremely funny and nails it on the dark humor. The cast is absolutely brilliant and each character is so unique. The writing crew is genius. Dan Levy's character David is my favorite. I can't get through an episode without laughing hysterically. Catherine O'Hara is positively brilliant with her character Moira. Definitely a binge worthy show and one of my all time favs. Eugene and Dan two intellectual masterminds!
617,"Interesting characters, great script, unique storylines. Love this show."
618,Seriously one of the funniest shows I've ever seen. The cast is amazingly talented! Add this to your watch list.
619,I just finished season 3 and am sad it's over! I loved watching the Rose family turn themselves into real humans as they develop lives they didn't know could exist! I really hope I see a season 4 soon!
620,"Thank heaven for Schitt's Creek! The writing, the acting, the silly situations.... oh and by the way.... where do they get those clothes? They ALL can't be from the Blouse Barn.... can they??? I love it. Each episode seems to get better and since I have recorded all of them so far, I can attest to that. I think mostly it's the facial features or the facial ""comments"" that don't even need words that is the best. Also, I love the continuous... ""what does that mean... I don't even know what that means""... comments that continue in each episode. So everyone, please keep up the amazing work and do everything in your power to remain for at least 20 more seasons. By then, I'll by 90 and I won't care anymore. Love every character! Please don't lose any of them."
621,"When CBC first began promoting Schitt's Creek, I thought it sounded, well, kind of stupid. And it did take an episode or two for the ensemble to get into a groove. But it was a great cast and I wanted to give it a chance, so I kept watching. It was worth it! As the first season progressed, it got better and better. The cast really work together: Adam Levy is a scream, Catherine O'Hara is cleverly batty, the dynamics between Adam Levy and Annie Murphy as brother and sister are perfect, and the peripheral characters have developed more dimension, especially Emily Hampshire's. I love this show!Now they're back for another season and I've watched the first three episodes. They've really got a good dynamic going. It's quite a dry humour, that can seem simplistic if you don't get it, but I really enjoy it. I just watched the latest episode and I found myself really laughing out loud. The characters play off each other and balance each other at the same time, never missing a beat. Brilliant casting! It's not complicated or demanding, but it's a lot more clever than might seem from a superficial glance, and well worth taking the time to get into it. I'm quite picky about comedies, find many of them irritating or just plain unfunny, but this one I gave a 9/10, I like it that much!"
622,"I've been a fan of Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara for what? 25 years? But their humor was always a bit too absurd and slow paced, especially in the Christopher Guest movies. This Schitt's Creek vehicle and the absolutely perfect cast around them, most especially Eugene's son Daniel who also writes episodes, takes their humor to a whole new level of hysterical. I've honestly never laughed out loud so often with a half hour show, and it just keeps on coming, episode after episode. The premise is a wee bit absurd, of course, but the situations they set up, the dialogue, the pacing, the complexity, the twists and turns and the absolutely perfect casting suck you deep into their bizarro world and wrings you out. I was missing jokes because I couldn't catch my breath at times. It's even beginning to bring some heartfelt dramatic moments as I begin Season 2. I cannot wait to see it through and I pray that the producers give us a good a long run. Let your guard down in the beginning, get to know the characters and you will not be able to stop watching! I have no idea who thinks of some of their situations, but I suspect that Daniel Levy is a the next comedic genius in the family."
623,I don't think I've ever been so invested in characters of a comedy like I am with this show. It's just genius!!
624,"I love this comedy! I think the costume designers for this show must have more fun than anybody: I love the clothing they put the characters into! But, the only reason the costumes work so well, is the actors inside the clothing: everyone is so talented, they fit right into the parts they are playing and everyone seems to be having a wonderful time! The scripts are all so well written, and each actor knows and plays to their part. Those characters! All of them, big or small part, they are all so funny! Love it!Just watching a few minutes of any one episode lifts my day, any day of the week.Yes, can be a bit crass in some of the jokes, but just on the edge enough to give a good giggle.I don't see how anyone cannot love this show. It is a hoot and filled with talent!"
625,"Just a beautiful, exciting, hilarious show about life love and community."
626,"I love Annie Murphy's character Alexis, and Daniel Levy and Eugene Levy are good, but Catherine O'Hara is completely awful. Each season was harder to take, it really became unbearable! No way would someone like that be a popular actress, she was so fakey. Ugh!!!"
627,"A very funny Canadian ""sitcom"" created by former SCTV comedian Eugene Levey and hid son Daniel. Certainly funnier than the average score re: this show. Eugene Levy and another former SCTV star Catherine O'Hara are top shelf in this Canadian comedy. Those from the US might not appreciate the Canadian flavoured show. No laugh track (laugh when it makes you laugh instead of being told when to laugh). The Rose family have lost their fortune and forced to move to a run down Motel in a small Town (Schitt's Creek) that the head of the family Johnny Rose (Eugene Levy) bought for his son (the Town not the Motel) David (Daniel Levy) as a joke. Daniel Levy is also very good playing a Metrosexual son out of his element as the rest of the family are. The Rose family have a hard time in their new digs but time may change their outlook as they grow accustomed to the town and it's inhabitants. Not a fall down funny type show but well worth watching. I'm giving it 8/10."
628,We absolutely Schitts Creek!!!We love Eugene Levy and His family then you add in Katherine O'Hara and Chris Elliot and this over the top Wes Anderson style comedy is really for those intelligent enough to pick up the subtle humor in seeing the uber elite get dropped on their royal butts in this backwards town and still survive. I feel like a fly on the wall in this hilarious original show. Its like being part of an inside joke each week. Oh and my daughters really think casting did well!!! winkFYI: We love the show and if you don't get it...well go watch Saved by the Bell Reruns and cut coupons!Cheers
629,"Finally a comedy that you can laugh out loud at! Cast is excellent. The writing of this show is witty, sarcastic, and over the top.The show is very unique, in that it is not your typical family sitcom. The family and the characters in Schitt's Creek are completely unique (lots of very witty sarcasm). The premise is different, finally a unique, well written, well acted and extremely funny show. I just love all the characters. Well done Eugene and Daniel Levy! Give this show a watch and you will love it!I hope the Network renews and orders several new Episodes. I can hardly wait for the new season."
630,"It's the perfect kind of comedy. Sometimes I catch myself laughing out loud! And I don't laugh a lot at stupid comedy. This is hilarious. I'm glad it's renewed. Clever and funny. Just love it! Eugene Levy's son on the show & (real son), has to be my favorite character. If he were real I would want to hang out with him. I wish the show was an hour long. I wish it was in netflix so I could watch the whole series in one sitting. It's a must watch. You won't be sorry. It's laugh out loud comedy at its best. I'm surprised it's not on a regular network. Basically it's about a filthy rich family that have lost pretty much all their wealth, except for the town Schitt's creek that Eugine Levy's character, the dad, had purchased for his son as a joke. So they had no choice but to move into this town and live in this run down motel. The whole town is ass backwards and has been stuck in time while this family is fast paced and expect lavish luxuries like spas and vegan choices. All of which this town would never have. I look forward to every episode and hate that it ends so fast. I wish it were an hour long. they could honestly make a movie out of this."
631,"Schitt's Creek is a quick witted and well written gem. Kudos to the casting director as well. However, when selling it to friends, I usually lose them with the show's title. While the show is a biting, humous display of class cohesion and spirit, I find the title unnessarily vulgar: as if the screenplay and title were written by people as different as Johnny Rose and Roland Schitt."
632,We need a court room scene with Richard Mull playing Bull Schitts.
633,"Do yourself a favour and binge watch this !!!
The acting in this 20 min comedy is incomparable to anything else. It's a fruit salad of comedy's best actors."
634,Each show brings more laughs. Thanks so much to the Levys for this gem.
635,"I adore this show, but viewer needs to enjoy dry sometimes stupid humor. For example, the mayor and his adorable bumpkin wife, Rowland and Jocelyn Schitt, if the humor of their names would not amuse you, then this is not the show for you! If you find that hysterical, you will devour this little gem. And Dan Levy is incredibly underrated for his comedy chops!"
636,Loved it! Can't wait to see more episodes on Netflix!
637,"I love this series! These people are shallow, pretentious, egotistical, selfish, and ridiculous.....and I love them. Each episode is a visit with a family -- and townsfolk -- you wouldn't want to live with but can't help liking and wanting to spend time with .... within reason. Developers Eugene and Daniel Levy (who also act in the series) -- and the writers -- have created characters who maintain a delicate balance, as on a high wire, between absurd narcissism and caring sensitivity. The Rose family, having lost their fortune, find themselves stuck in a fate-worse-than-death situation in a town--Schitt's Creek-- they own but hold in complete disregard. Eventually, somehow, they make the best of it, due, in no small part, to the town's citizens, who react to their polite superiority and contempt with warmth and acceptance. There are so many ways this series could have gone wrong and yet it doesn't. As over the top as it is, there are no false notes. The dialogue is excellent and the acting, especially by the four principals who play the Rose family, is brilliant, incomparable. This is absurd comedy at its best. That it also has a heart becomes obvious only after several episodes, when you begin to see the decency of the failed video magnate Johnny Rose, his egotistical soap opera star wife, Moira, and their immature, vain, spoiled, empty headed (though not dumb) adult children, non-starters David and Alexis. The supporting characters are also comedy gold, from Chris Elliott as Roland, the clueless and self-aggrandizing mayor, Jocelyn, his sweet school teacher wife, Stevie, the motel manager/receptionist who is nobody's fool, Twyla, the waitress at the town's only cafe, Ted, the handsome young veterinarian smitten with Alexis, and the assorted, quirky Town Council members. There is a sweetness about this show. The Roses, while often -- mostly -- foolish and oblivious, are never mean or intentionally cruel. Beneath their outrageousness, they are a loving family, positive and supportive. Johnny Rose, who is marginally more self aware than the others, is an admirable father and husband, concerned for his family's welfare. You find yourself wanting these people to be happy and glad to celebrate their small successes.This is a series both funny and, at times, moving. Those who haven't seen it do not know what they are missing."
638,"This show highlights what is wrong with millenials. Also what is with the mom's fake accent? It's a made up accent that doesn't exist outside of this show. The humor is very dry, repetative and I can predict what is going to happen in every scene.There's few characters and no diversity in the scene's. Not much to look at but a run down hotel, ugly outfits, and the same characters again and again."
639,"This show never disappoints with the outrageousness of it all. Each character is unique and wholey exagerated. The extreme exageration from Moira's costumes to Alexis's flightiness to David's effeminate behaviour and reactions makes the show. 
Eugene Levy is billiant. How he can hold a straight face i don't know? It's like watching the old Second City or SNL from the 70's. Over the top completely politically incorrect in your face humour. LOVE LOVE LOVE it. Its right up there with Seinfeld...a show about nothing but you can't stop watching. The characters freely say what we think and wish we could say in our everyday lives. Bravo!"
640,"Great canadian original, love this show. all 3 seasons are on netflix and bing watched this show must watch. its fresh, great acting"
641,"This is binge worthy, fun TV! Each actor on this series has carefully crafted their character and I love them all! Kudos to all of you!!!!"
642,"Binge watched entire first season, couldn't get enough! Watched second season, it was still good but i started to find the facial expressions and reaction shots (Alexis and David are practically the same character when it comes to mugging for the camera) a little too repetitive. And then there is season three. Although i like the idea that David ""likes the wine and not the label"" I found the situation with Stevie and David plus one awkward and seriously unrealistic (and not in a funny way). They can definitely use the confusing chemistry between the two (plus various ones) characters but the way they did it in that story line was just kind of cringe worthy. No matter how desperate a person is, they would not carry on like that if they were besties and living/working in the same building. I still LOVE the characters and the idea of the town I just wish they would expand their ideas a little (ala Arrested Development). I also highly recommend NOT binge watching this show because it loses its flavor (like binging on your favorite dessert). PS Dan Levy and his costar do a nice job in the last episode of season 3 in ""their scene"". David, you are a very sweet and ""generous"" man after all <3 And I'm pretty sure Dan Levy is brilliant! (as for Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara, it goes without saying, always comic geniuses)"
643,I thought this was supposed to be funny? Maybe it's a different type of humor. Shouldn't it make you laugh?
644,This show is criminally underrated because it is a Canadian show and I have a strong feeling that if it debuted in America it would be more well known.
645,"After you watch the first couple of episodes of this show it almost feels like a tradition, something you'd watch at the same time every night on a cable channel.Starring Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara, this shows comes alive with the idea of a higher class, wealthy family forced to mix with ordinary suburban citizens.In my opinion Catherine O'Hara just makes this show, with her bizarre, outrageous structure on what life should be like. She owns every line with her hysterical characterization as Moira Rose.Possibly the greatest comedy I've seen so far in the 21st century 8.3/10"
646,"the funniest show i've ever seen it's like the everlasting gobstopper for t.v. IT KEEPS GETTING BETTER AND THE CHARACTERS ARE F!@#$%^& HILARIOUS!! It's a sense of humor i understand I ACTUALLY GET IT and i can't say that about much on movies/T.V. although the situations are sometimes unrealistic the dialogue and characters are just absolutely flawless and well rounded and funny from JEWELRLY STANDS,WORDS TO THE WISE,THESE ARE STUPID, MUSCULES LIKE CORNUTS,BOB'S RUN, ROLIN LICKING HIS TEETH...the attention to detail is appreciated and funny and It's hard to make me laugh I never write reviews about anything but THEY ALL deserve recognition for this comedy genius! THANK YOU ALL FOR GIVING MY FAMILY AND I SOMETHING WE CAN ALL reenact and ENJOY CANT WAIT TO SEE WHATS NEXT!!"
647,"we are on our watch season 1 - 3 number 5. Every time we re-watch a show, we see more of the little funny things that you miss the 1st or 2nd time. We went to the two locations where the show is set. Was shown around Bob's Garage by Joe (the real owner). Its true that Canadian's are welcoming and friendly. Now that we have been in the locations, we love the show even more. Can't wait for season 4. We need more of these Canadian shows on Netflix (as its not likely Australian FTA networks will show them)."
648,"First off, I must admit that I am totally hooked on Schitt's Creek. I've been watching the first 2 seasons on Netflix and purchased Season 3 on Amazon! It's funny that, as a rule, comedies just don't seem to get the respect from critics that dramas, mysteries and even sci-fi do. I suppose at heart, I'm a big fan of comedy, and Schitt's Creek just does it for me! The script-writing is brilliant and watching each episode a few times enhances your enjoyment, with every nuance evidently becoming ever clearer. Along with great scripts are a phenomenally assembled cast. Catherine O'Hara does a brilliant job playing Moira, Annie Murphy consistently outdoes herself as Alexis, Dan just ""Wows"" as David and Eugene holds down the fort as Johnny Rose. Let's not forget TV's very best supporting cast including Sarah Levy, Chris Elliott, Jenny Robertson, Emily Hampshire, John Humphill, Tim Rozon, Dustin Milligan. The more you watch... The more you'll get hooked... It's THAT great!"
649,Finding this on Netflix I saw a familiar face in the cast Eugene Levy so decided to give it a go. Well it is a slow burner you need to keep watching to get into the programme. Now I watch/listen whilst doing jobs around the house and find myself laughing out loud. I now care about the characters. It is a charming series with comedy and insight.
650,"Literally (really literally) laugh to tears every episode. This is a really great show. Chris Elliot's character is the best. Very good character development and very well written episodes. If there are negative reviews for this, they are written by people with no sense of humor what so ever."
651,I love this show so much. It was just something I added to my watchlist and BAM...ADDICTED. Excellent cast and great dry humor! I love the storyline and just can't get enough. Please don't end this show...so much that can be done here. I can't wait for more episodes. The premise of the show is a wealthy family that loses it all. The family is then forced to make it in a little town without any of the luxuries they are accostumed to.
652,"Love this show! If you liked the movie ""Best in Show"" you will like this series. It is quirky and different from the major network sitcoms. It is definitely a comedy and not a ""dramady"". Eugene Levy is great as Johnny Rose the patriarch of the family. His real life son plays his son in the show. He is a natural like his father. Eugene's real life daughter plays a waitress at the small town cafe. Catherine O'Hara is just over the top hilarious! There are several supporting characters that really add to the show. Chris Elliott plays a kind of creepy part that is reminiscent of his role in ""There's Something About Mary"". Townsfolk such as Bob and Ronnie add to the quirkiness of the show. The seasons go by so fast. I'm already looking forward to the 3rd season!"
653,"It's been awhile since I've laughed so much watching a sit-com. The premise is not necessarily original: Rich family suddenly loses fortune and must reassess their situation. We've seen this film before. Nonetheless the perfectly cast ensemble of veteran comedians manages to deliver side-splitting visual and verbal gags faster than viewers can recover from laughing out loud. The added bonus to this ""situation"" is the fact that after the family is suddenly evicted by federal authorities from their palace- like mansion, they are reduced to moving to a ridiculous little ""Hickstown"" once purchased ""as a joke"" by the formerly filthy-rich father, where they are forced to live as guests among the poor people they used to laugh at. Time to come down from their high horse and realize that perhaps there is more to life than money, glamour and pampered pleasure. Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levi have been around at least since the early 80s when they co-starred in ""SCTV"""", the satirical sit-com about a struggling TV Station, and have starred in a variety of similarly outrageous feature film comedies. As patriarchs of this ""spoiled rotten"" family of narcissistic chronic complainers they are the perfect lead actors for the job. Levi's real-life son plays their 30- something ultra-dependent and selfish son, and is a delight in this role. The 30-something daughter perfectly acts the part of the spoiled princess who never quite matured emotionally to responsible adulthood, even if she doesn't quite reach the level of narcissism of her brother. Another stand-out performance is given by the Mayor of Schitt's Creek, Roland Schitt (everyone says the name without laughing out loud, which in itself shows unbelievable restraint and professional acting). Every delicious detail in this series is for laughs, and there is no end to them!""Schitt's Creek"" is a refreshing change from the usual ""formula ha ha"" shows served up as entertainment. This looks more like an instant cult classic a la ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" and ""Arrested Development"". I give this one a rare 10 star rating. Recommended without reservations!"
654,"Eugene Levy is a recognised giant in comedy, and with good reason; his son, Daniel Levy is clearly at least equally talented. everyone, from Catherine O'Hara (my favourite of hers is an obscure short video made for a David Letterman special, many years ago: ""Angst on a Shoestring"") to Chris Elliot, and Rizwan Manji, it is stocked wall to wall with brilliance.this is a genuine work of comedic art."
655,"I've been a great fan of comedy TV shows since friends,will & grace, the big bang theory etc.This show is really on my top 1 lists. Its refreshing,smart, creative and i've seen from an interview that most of the script are improvised.Its by far the funniest show on TV right now which is underrated.Its a hilarious show played by excellent actors and great writing.I strongly recommend this show for those who haven't watch it yet."
656,"I never write reviews, however, I felt so strongly that this comedy was not getting its much-deserved praise that I wanted to chime in. The writing is smart and the characters are so expertly portrayed. Every single character is quirky, hilarious and so cringe-worthy and flawed. I have lived in small towns and the townspeople are portrayed with humour and compassion. There are always such characters in small towns and you get to know them so well. The way they portray the shallow, sophisticated main family is absolutely hilarious and though they are really stereotypical and shallow, you still get quite attached to them because the actors are so endearing. Bravo to Eugene and DanielLevy for creating something so original and funny. I just cannot get enough of it and hope that this series continues!!!If you like intelligent humour that is sometimes understated and sometimes silly, give this a chance."
657,"I must admit I started watching this show as I was intrigued by it's title, so I didn't really know what to expect. Well, I am so glad I tuned in because I laughed out loud. The premise is clever, the writing is brilliant, and the interaction between the cast is spot on. I cannot believe how many of these characters remind me of people I know which makes it even funnier to watch. Also marvelous to see Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara together again. Although I thoroughly enjoyed every episode, I think my favorites so far have been ""Bad Parents"" and ""Wine and Roses"". I hope Schitt's Creek has a long run as it is one of the funniest shows on TV."
658,"I was hooked at the very first episode! This show is hilarious! I knew Eugene Levy from previous movies and always thought he was so funny and he is totally funny here also. But the one that I just love is his son Dan, whom I didn't know even existed before watching this show. As a matter of fact, the whole cast is fun to watch! I'm very happy that I gave this one a try and will continue to watch each and every episode until the very end. There's no way I will get tired of watching it and I certainly hope they keep it alive for a very, very long time. This show is on the very top of my favorite comedy show to watch. I know my review doesn't tell much, but I just had to put that 5 stars and say how much I love it! :-)"
659,"For a Canadian made show, I am impressed. Great characters, great story and great collaboration of Canadian artists coming together to make this show.I am looking forward to the second season, and of course, the third, fourth, fifth and so on. Keep this rolling CBC, it's the next best thing next to Dragon's Den, Little Mosque and Mr. Dressup!!!This is a pleasant refresher of natural comedy, Eugene is performing at his best. All of the other characters are believable, and consistent. Each episode contributes to the main story line, while each episode has it's own feel and value. I can remember episodes when they happen!On a final note, I am happy Season One is on netflix. A great venue for Canadians to watch, and help this show deserve the ratings it deserves!!!"
660,I really loved the show but the last season killed it for me.
661,"My Review. Season one Schitt's Creek
My Rating 9/10The only question I have is Why has it taken me so long to get acquainted with the Rose family and the residents of Schitts Creek.
If the Trump family were as interesting as The Rose family I could see a rival series but they're not so leave that alone.
Imagine you're a family as wealthy and living the millionaire lifestyle of The Trump's and suddenly the wheels fall off your Gold Cadillac and your left practically penniless and unemployed (one can have hopes and dreams) with just one asset left the deeds to a hokey Midwest hick town named after a pioneer family named Schitt.
The fictional town of Schitt's Creek is located at Pinewood Studios, Toronto, Ontario, Canada and the series was created by Canadian Dan Levy and his father Eugene Levy who also stars as Johnny Rose the head of the family.
Double Emmy Award winner Catherine O'Hara gives the best modern comedian performance I've seen since Lucille Ball cast as Moirai Rose the delightfully elegant dipsomaniac matriarch who in the first series almost equals Lucy's Vitameatavegeman add when she does a tv add for a fruit wine company.
Catherine O'Hara's character ""Moira Rose"" frequently wears black and white stripes as a nod to her role as Delia Deetz in ""Beetlejuice"".
The other three members of the Rose family likeable husband Johnny (Eugene Levy) and their two spoilt but very likeable adult children David (Dan Levy) a pansexual ,according to his Dad who has a particular penchant for male beauty products and his sister Alexis (Annie Murphy) who has a particular penchant for a local Schmitt Creek stud or any young stud in the town.
In a strange real life plot comparison I read that after her house burned down and she had a mere $3 left in her bank account, Annie Murphy considered quitting acting altogether. Fortunately, she got the audition for ""Schitt's Creek"" and landed the iconic role of Alexis. We also have Moira's estranged sister DeeDee played by Jennifer Erwin she lacks Moira's sincerity but like all sibling rivalry provides some great sisterly interactions .
Schitt's Creek Is the first television series to sweep the Prime Time Emmy Awards in all major acting categories in a single year.
I'm thrilled to read there's another 67 episodes of this 9 Emmy Award winning series left to look forward to as I like this family and it's refreshing to watch a series that's clever but uncomplicated and not full of flashbacks and fast forwards or a multitude of characters that just leave you confused .
I can only judge the first series but if the standard of comedy script writing and performances keeps up I'll be watching Schitt's Creek for the duration.
To me this show is contemporary comedy entertainment at its best that pays homage to the great shows of the past years like I Love Lucy, Seinfeld, The Honeymooners , Will and Grace and Sex and the City. However it doesn't copy any of these great shows Schitt's Creek is unique and new.
These American characters are simple folk so likeable with no dramas ,you could never imagine them in a protest march or involved in political activism it seems like a world that's disappeared,no COVID, no violence, some fruity language and lots of funny human foibles and hilarious situations laced with a wicked black sense of comedy."
662,"One of the best tv shows ever made. Absolutely hilarious one minute, then delightfully heartfelt the next. When you look up character development in the dictionary it says Schitts Creek. Watching these characters over the course of six seasons was a joy. The whole cast has undeniable chemistry that carries you through the show. One of the best written series ever, the storyline flows remarkably well for a comedy. A joy that will be missed."
663,"Again, comedy is so personal- I got many laughs and smiles out of this show. I felt better after watching it, without feeling stupid. This is more situational comedy than gags, which I like. it ended off on a good note, as if it was a series finale. I am glad to see another season coming. I am now wondering what the last season was that I saw (5?). and there's #6 coming?
**This really could have been a one trick pony- one joke show, and gone no where- but that's not the case- Super Rich family goes broke, destitute, all they own is Schitt's Creek which they bought for a joke bec. of the name. Living in shared rooms in a motel, which makes Motel 6 look Luxury. They stay cheerful.
After 4 seasons, finally, 3 important Emmys. Eugene Levy, actor, writer, creator, Catherine O'Hara, best comedy- up against The Good Place which for me takes all time best. I like Eugene better than Ted- Catherine & Kristen are both great; one has to get it.
I binged watch most of it in 3 or 4 segments- last year- it seemed over-looked-
Catherine has an affected, weird accent & style, fits her & the part. (right now don't have it)
The daughter, Alexis, with that bent wrist, also fits the character, but it's weird. Dan Levy, Eugenes gay son, in life too, stars, wrote, created. yes, some stereotyping, but that's all in the character of the show, bigger than life. As they get past it, it takes them beyond the stereotypes. It's played with panache & style- even the way Catherine's clothes are dramatic, not off the rack, mostly black and white. Dan wears these outrageous artsy sweaters, often black and white- Alexis has a definite style- this contributes to the concept of the show- and creates a visual platform. The personalities, stay the same but EVOLVE, as do the story lines. Eugene at first seems understated, but is very nuanced. As mentioned. at his age how does he keep that dark hair, groomed, no roots. Love his eyebrows. it would be too real, if he went to a near by town to get it done. Also Catherine, high maintenance., never goes to the hair dresser. her cut (&color) requires regular maintenance. someone mentioned Chris Guest- yes, - I would put, Baskets (Louie is genius) the Good Place, some of Arrested Development, & Schitt's Creek in the same category.
after awhile, I can forgive Chris Elliot for being a buffoon. Great ensemble cast.
I love this show"
664,"Do not expect too much out of this drama, but Schitt's Creek has it's way to entertain the viewer, with the simple plot and the nice character build up. Thoughout the four seasons (that's where I'm now!!) the characters experianced huge changes that didn't come overnight or served to you in the gasp of a few episodes. So, because it manages to entertain and it didn't follow the same plot and theme for all its seasons, 7 out of 10."
665,"Just enjoy what it is ok?
It's light and funny
Great acting and character development
Not trying to be anything else."
666,"I don't write a lot of reviews but since there are so many bad reviews of this show I have to really wonder why. I don't want to give it a ten because it's not the sort of show that I would watch again and again (very few comedies are) but I did binge watch three of the seasons in one week.I will say that I didn't like this show the first time I tried to watch it; it seemed goofy and the characters were a little too outlandish-same experience I had with shows like Kimmy Schmidt, Arrested Development, etc.-but over time the characters are fleshed out and you start to connect with them on a deeper level. It's a show that has heart and even if you find the characters annoying initially, the themes are pretty relatable and the way it takes on parent/sibling conflicts, romantic relationships, and just growing up in general is really fresh and done in a way that makes you reconsider your first impressions of the Roses.If you prefer one dimensional characters with no redeemable attributes, this might not be your show. I personally really appreciate the fact that they've taken unloveable people and made them human when it would have been so much easier to cash in on millennial bashing or stereotyping. I really have to wonder what prompted so many one star reviews: is it because the characters are annoying or is it because the show makes you care about and even root for characters that you would prefer to only have negative feelings for?"
667,SCTV graduates and youthful ingenuity make this lovable series as funny as it should be and as poignant as good comedy often is.
668,"Found it very funny the first couple of seasons but then the mother, daughter & son became extremely annoying...a shame."
669,"It's pretty amusing, but, face it, the Levys just watched Arrested Development and remade it. In that sense it's not as creative as people want to believe and about half as funny."
670,"I absolutely love this show. Its hilarious in a silly subtle way, which is my favourite kind of humour, and it is heartwarming as well. The cast is fantastic and they character development is great. I recommend it to anyone I talk to because when it comes down to it, its funny and about a family that grows together and becomes closer over time as they adapt to their new lifestyle. Also one of the best things about cast is their mannerisms.... spot on and hilarious and I find myself acting like them the more I watch."
671,"I absolutely love this show, it gets better and better as it goes on and it has a similar vibe to it as Frasier - light entertainment with soul. I have watched it all the way through twice already. Converted a few friends to it too."
672,Good God this is a funny show. When Eugene Levy plays the straight man it can't help but be great. Perfect cast!
673,"This show is brilliant, it's Dallas & Dynasty in reverse, the beginning of the Me Society. A very dysfunctional wealthy family that has to be thrown into poverty to grow to realize what is really important in life, family and friends. Quite the opposite of reality today, where everything is a commodity with no intrinsic value. We do need more shows like this, but doubt that the 6 Corporately owned networks would ever air them. We do have to Thank to Amazon and Netflix!"
674,"This is an excellent show, and I cannot recommend it enough!Its style of comedy reminds me a little of British humor on some levels (which I adore), but it's done with a very Canadian twist. Many of the components of this will be completely lost on certain audience members and I understand the reason behind of the poor reviews this show was getting when it was first released; it's not a show that's for everyone's sensibilities and its humor is definitely on a different ""level"".Yes, there are also many things that make no sense, but that's part of the farce: it's very much a comedy of errors. I love like the fact that the family is basically destitute, but they have a wardrobe that is so ""on trend"", that you rarely see them wear the same outfits twice (except for the father, which makes no sense considering that they live in a motel in a totally cramped space and have no money to afford those outrageous clothes). The mother reminds me a little of Edina in Absolutely Fabulous for her fashion sense, and Eddi is one of my favorite TV characters of all times. I love the daughter's over the top, ""out of place"" high-fashion glam, and the son's neurotic, pansexual, generally confused ways. Every character is so multi-dimensional, but in the end you can tell that they are ultimately good people trying to cope with whatever weird personal skills that they have developed over the years. I can see a lot of growth in these characters every week and it's so much fun to watch. The town's people are also absolutely adorable in their silliness. Ten thumbs up for me, I hope it keeps going for many more seasons! I think that if you are going to try this show, you have to give it a chance."
675,"So far they are all doing their acting jobs perfectly. ""Selfish, duplicitous wh-*re"". (Talking about her daughter!) got a feeling this is my next binge watch."
676,"This show, Schitt's Creek is one of the funniest series I have watched. The quick step, funny expressions that tell all, and absolute oblivion their previous life caused is very entertaining! Watching their oblivious self-awareness melt is adorable and amusingly thought provoking. The Levy family are simply amazingly talented, Catherine O'Hara is hysterically convincing, Annie Murphy is stunning, funny and relatable...I love her expressions! Emily Hampshire plays a great straight-man as Stevie against David's eccentric self; love their chemistry. Tim Rozon and Dustin Milligan are gorgeous and different from most hot characters. Jennifer Robertson (Jocelyn) is exactly how kind, yet knowing we should expect from her role. Chris Elliot/Roland is just gross, as they obviously want him to be; however, I am so glad that I was right about his enhanced grossness. John Hemphill/Bob is hilarious the way he enters a room. Robin Duke adds a lot to the show with her hilarious character; very sweet connection with David, their scenes are crazy funny. Karen Robins/Ronnie adds to the obscured gender and role meld of the show, yet she is kinda scary. Remember Pat on SNL, she could have almost gone in that direction...is she/he or isn't he/she? All in all I cannot imagine what fault our modern society could possibly find with this VERY entertaining series. WATCH IT!"
677,"With all the BS shows running this year focused on violent conflicts and turning kids comics into nightmares . It was refreshing to watch something fun. I love the slow broil Schitt's Creek develops.Lets you get to feel for the characters Instead of bloody gore rammed down your throat. Hope to see more story development and future seasons. My favorite character is ""David"" a complex and special guy. The total opposite of current ""administration followers""."
678,"My sister told me about this show. She said it was funny. It is on Netflix, so I decided to give it a try. I started by having it playing in the background as I did things around the house and watched some. Suddenly, I didn't want to leave the couch. These people's facial expressions and mannerism have to be watched as well as the story lines. It's a perfect mix. I'm so happy this was on Netflix. I watched all 3 seasons in less than a week! Now, I'm ready for season 4, but I'm not sure when that will be available to Netflix."
679,"I just finished binge watching all the seasons. If you're into dry comedy with a touch of wacko, this is a show for you. The cast has great chemistry. I especially love the scenes with Daniel Levy and Emily Hampshire (David & Stevie.) I do wish they would use less of Catherine O'Hara. She seemed to be predominant in Season 3. I've never thought she was that funny and I don't really enjoy watching her that much. The rest of the cast is fun. You should give the show a try."
680,"A friend recommended it to me and I just cant get enough of it. Every single character is so dry and funny. Rare that anything makes me laugh out loud anymore. Great site gags too, like Moira's wigs on the wall, David's clothes, duct tape on the cafe booths . I don't know, it's just great. AS funny as it is, the best part is that it still has a lot of heart. I really like all of these characters and the actors who play them. More. Faster. Please."
681,"The characters are all very likable- I can't pick a favorite. The characters have been very well crafted. There aren't any pratfalls, but the reactions of each character often have me laughing out loud. Even Bob is hilarious when he bounces into the scene. Exceptional character development, each actor has brought their best. GREAT lines in every episode!The set, the setting, the camera shots are all top quality. Each episode features a clever script. Great story as well. This is currently my favorite show on Netflix and my fiance's favorite show. I watched the finale of season 3 without her and she wasn't happy with me. I'm shocked that the reviews are bad, but you know the internet Trolls have won according to a recent research."
682,"The jokes, the awkwardness, and the situations that the Rose family get's put in. This is a little gem of a show that must be found. The episodes aren't long so binge watching is made very easy, but you'll wish that they're longer. If you find yourself looking for something new to watch. Check this show out."
683,I have been watching this show for the past few weeks. I cannot get enough of it. What an amazing cast. The humor is spot on. Just love it. I wish there were more shows like this one.. I hope they continue recording additional seasons.. Super funny and entertaining.. The Cast is too funny. They're facial expressions alone are hilarious...seriously cant get enough!! LOL
684,"This show should of been an hour long series. Each character has their own cute, crazy, sassy charaistic that no matter what age you are when you watch this show, you will find a character that draws you in. I can not tell you how many people I told about this show and each person I've told are completely hooked to Schitt's creek.Eugene and dan levy are comedy geniuses. Chris Elliott plays Roland the town mayor and just a simple small town guy who is corky and some what of a easy going man.Great show and I definitely recommend everybody watch this show.Cute"
685,"A friend told me she thought I would love this show so I've been binge watching the last few days!Oh My Goodness......I love this quirky show! I know their acting is over the top but that's partly why it's so funny to me! I know this isn't real life but it's just a TV show and a funny one at that! The character of David is just hilarious in everything he does....his words, his expressions, etc.The only character that I don't like is Roland Schitt (Chris Elliott). I've never cared for him in anything as he pretty much plays the same type character in everything I've seen him in.So glad I tuned in to this show and hopefully it will be on for many more seasons!"
686,Such a refreshing TV series. It is so authentically funny and each one of the main cast is super in their portray of their characters. I love Eugene. Catherine is probably the funniest. I love the show and hope it will win many awards !!. Proud to be Canadian !!! I am happy it is airing both is US and Canada.
687,"I had to write a review because this is one of my favorite new shows! Thanks to Netflix, I binge watched the first two seasons and fell in love!!! Every character is uniquely perfect for sarcastic comedy lovers! I recommended this show to everyone I know. Do yourself a favor and watch!!! Schitt-Head for life!!!!"
688,"If you like obnoxious, satirical, semi-crude humor, this show is for you. This cast is absolutely brilliant, all of them. Dan, however, takes the show from funny to hysterical. Every nuisance makes me laugh. I love the absurdity of it all. Best new sitcom in a long time. A must watch!"
689,"I never write reviews..like at all, but I wanted to express my love for this show. And I'm not exactly sure why but it completely hooks me. Started out slow at first but one after another and I can't wait for the next one. Very refreshingly humorous and witty. I love the characters! David is hilarious in the show. Both levy's are great together. Catherine O'Hara fits the role perfectly and Alexis is a spot on ditsy, self absorbed spoiled rich kid character. Chris Elliot is great as a small town mayor. Love the whole town cast."
690,"I WANT MORE SCHITT! Seriously. I've watched everything I can for free on either amazon prime or Netflix and I'm about to start going through withdrawal.When I watched the first episode, I thought it was alright, but I kept going. Like all the best shows, you don't realize you love it until you're halfway done with the season because you can't stop pressing ""next episode"". The slow character development makes it so that you don't even know how you go from wanting to slap a character to not being able to imagine the show without them. One of the best parts about this show is the father-son duo Johnny and David, played by real life father-son Eugene and Dan Levy. Their interactions are so entertaining. Two of my favorite characters are Stevie and Mutt. Stevie (Emily Hampshire) nails her witty remarks, and Mutt (Tim Rozon) is a nice foil for some of the quicker-talking, more dramatic characters. Overall, I took a point off for the short episode length, though they manage to use it pretty well."
691,"Schitt's Creek is has quickly become my favorite sitcom, even surpassing The Goldberg's. For me the best part of both shows is the excellent actress playing the part of the mom. But Catherine O'Hara outshines even the great Wendy Mclendon- Covey with her restrained yet over-the-top portrayal of Moira Rose. As someone who followed SCTV from beginning to end I love having Eugene Levy and O'Hara in my home every week. And Levy's son, Dan, who's also a writer on the show, is hysterical.Add Chris Elliot who starred in a previous favorite of mine, ""Get A Life"" and CBC has created a show tailor- made to my taste in comedy.I must warn that Schitt's Creek can be difficult to view at times. The ditzyness of the Rose children, David and Alexis, can be embarrassing to watch. But I think that they're the 2 most original and fleshed-out characters that I've seen in a sitcom for a long time. The long term plot lines in this show are addictive and the story develops to the point where I can go from laughing hysterically to shedding tears on a single line of dialogue.I have to admit that besides the great writing, acting and directing my favorite moments on Shitt's Creek are when Catherine O'Hara walks into the scene wearing the most outrageous outfits and wigs. And I admire her as a comedienne for allowing her face to be made-up in such a ghastly manner.Shitt's Creek can seamlessly range from very subtle deadpan comedy to high camp in an instant yet it never fails to convince you that these are real people. This show is much more sophisticated than your average CBC produced comedy.But the reason I decided to write this, my very first IMDb review, is a current plot device on the show and the reason for the spoiler alert. It's the Schitt's new car, the giant, black Lincoln Continental. I laugh every time I think about it and can't wait for next week to find out what disasters this car will bring to the Schitt's family. SCTV also knew how to make a big Lincoln funny."
692,"Extremely overrated. It's hard to tell what the writing is trying to accomplish-comedy? Drama? Outlandishness? It's not absurd enough to be funny nor are the characters relatable enough to empathize with. It's in no man's land. After watching 5 seasons certain characters-Stevie, Roland, Twyla, Patrick, Ted, Jocelyn-are just as undeveloped as they were the first episodes of season 1. Yet they take up a TON of airtime. But the worst part of it all is IT IS NOT FUNNY!"
693,"Great opening, great plot, interesting characters, but after a while it begins to get tedious with the over sexualized, not so funny relationship ideas. What is interesting is that the show can go from very good to very bad in a matter of a scene or two. I would have liked to see it remain a comedy pitting the ideas of this wealthy, dignified yet shallow family against the country bumpkins and their down-to-earth lifestyles. There is much comedy to be mined from this - and the best parts might be the family's relationship to Rolland and his family. Unfortunately when the show goes off into the relationship woes of the two children it is no longer funny and actually gets a bit creepy. David's straight and gay relationships - smooching with various dudes - love triangles - heartache - all this just takes away from the laughs. David is a very introverted character and doesn't need a relationship to make him interesting. Perhaps if he got a job as a cook or a waiter in the restaurant it would have been more effective than opening a boring gift shop with his romantic partner.
Love the role the daughter brings to the show - her shallowness is epic and hilarious. She has a certain 'Je ne sais quoi'"
694,"I love this show. Literally have seen almost every TV series on Netflix and this is a show that I've watched the seasons at least twice. Reason why is I love the humor this show has, its not the ""slap on the knee"" funny but it has dry humor.Also great acting of the characters, and I love David, he is my favorite. Also his sister Alexis is such an idiot but she is a great actor and funny!WATCH DIS SHOW!!!!"
695,"I am just starting to catch up and watch the show from the beginning. I am guilty of pre-judging the show based on so many failed Canadian unfunny sitcoms so I never gave it a chance when it came out.But after watching the first season, now into the second, it keeps me laughing. Particularly O'Hara and Elliot's characters are over the top funny.Not many modern sit-coms make me laugh anymore. The jokes are so predictable. But this show is refreshingly amusing. Mostly because all the characters are so well thought out and defined. And the premise is so original. Like the opposite of Beverly Hillbillies.The only odd, illogical character is Chris Elliot's mayor character's wife, Jocelyn Schitt. There is no believable reason why such a nice, seemingly intelligent character would not only put up with, but adore her slobby, misogynist, pig-headed husband."
696,"I just read some reviews from the critics, and they all seems to think this show is not very good. They are flat out wrong. I believe they must have only seen the first episode, and made a judgement at that time. I'm in the third season now, and the characters are really starting to come together. The family is surprisingly believable (maybe because its Eugene Levy and his son) in a very quirky and nontraditional way. I look forward to every episode, its a really nice break from the ultra intensive, very character intensive HBO drama / action shows. This is actually my first time reviewing a show, or really anything for that matter - I just finished watching the ""Bad review"" episode (a bit subliminal I know), and it occurred to me, maybe I should send some appreciation back at Schitt's Creek. I hope it has 10 seasons."
697,"We've been looking for a show to love after Revenge, Paradise and Broad Church and finally found it when we took at chance on Schitt's Creek.The family is lovable. The actors/actresses are top notch. David Rose, the son is our absolute favorite. The story line is fresh and new. We watched 6 episodes before we had to call it a night on the first watch. This is show will be a top favorite!"
698,"I saw this show advertised and thought I'd give it a try. I ended up binge watching it. It's a about a rich family that lose everything and had to move to Schitts Creek, a small nothing town the father bought his son as a joke. They're trying to sell it, but was on sale for decades before they bought it. It's a mystery where they do get the little bit of money they spend. Eugene Levy and Daniel Levy created it and both act in it. I should have known David, Daniel Levy, is Eugene son when I saw his eyebrows. Eugene has such distinctive eyebrows and he sure doesn't look 70. The characters are so entertaining. Chris Elliott plays such weird characters and this show is no different. Roland kind of grows in you as the show goes on as did the other characters. Catherine O'hara's character is so dramatic and she plays her well. I can't figure out where it's going and that makes me want to keep watching it."
699,"The only barely tolerable character is the son
All the others are useless and unbearable. In 5 episodes i've never smiled once, let alone laughed. It's boring and unpleasant and in general a complete waste of time."
700,"SECOND REVIEW:
I can't believe it, but I want to change my mind. I powered through the first three seasons and then finally fell in love with this show. By the time S4 E13 rolled around (the Christmas special), all the characters seem to have morphed into normal, lovable characters - even the repulsive-acting Alexis. I began to develop a special empathy with them all. I couldn't believe it. The story was endearing, the characters more believable, and the normalcy was oh so welcome.
So I changed my rating from a 4 to a 7. And now I'm watching the whole series again, from the beginning. Alexis is still very off-putting and stomach turning, but knowing that she'll eventually become a wounded butterfly 🦋 is keeping me going.
I predict that if you can make it to season 4, you will like this show. You will not want it to end, but it will.
___________
FIRST REVIEW
I'm beginning to hate I this show more and more every episode. David Levy (Dan) and Annie Murphy (Alexis) do so much overacting it's nauseating at this point (S3 E4). Hands held high like a puppy begging for food, limp wristed, fingers all akimbo, waving around from side to side, freakish mouth poses - this is not funny, it's just stupid. And both have this over-exaggerated head bobbing thing going on. It's not cute; it's not funny; but it is tiresome and eventually nauseating. Dan (David) plays a non binary (I guess that's what he is 🤔) whose gay mannerisms are so over the top that they make a flamer look almost normal. You will want to poke your eyes out! But, oh, the head bobbing, the head bobbing! This is simply mannerisms, not acting. Too bad daddy Levy couldn't teach his son the difference.The vast majority of 2nd tier actors seem to be unable to act at all: Ted, Mutt, Stevie - all are as bland, shallow, and robotic as can be. Why do some reviewers here think that's solid gold to (non-) act that way? Har de Har Har. It's just simply amateurish and boring. Stevie is the absolute worst. It's probably her meds that make her act the way she does (doesn't). She's not funny, not feminine, not clever, not cute, and certainly not humorous. You will get to the point that when you see that she's in a scene, you will want to fast forward the video. No, she's not dark, just absent a soul and a personality.Now, Twyla was an exception. She is funny, bright, bubbly, yet deadpan. Hard to believe she's a Levy. Her scenes, though not funny, aren't repulsive either, like so many of the other scenes.The main actors? Eugene is ok, but not funny. Dry, humorless, predictable, boring? Yes! Occasionally funny, but incredibly rarely.O'Hara? She's great. Funny, arrogant, clueless, freakish - all of the above. But she's not enough to carry the show given all the other duds in the lineup.By the time you give up on this show, you won't be able to stand David (Dan Levy) or Alexis (Annie Murphy). Actually, you will likely be unable to stand any of it."
701,"I have tried to watch this show at least 8 different times thinking there was something I was missing as everyone seemed to love it. I started rewatching it the past week and my god it is just AWFUL.It has to be one of the most boring shows I have ever seen. For reference, my favourites shows of all time are The Office (US version) and Arrested Development. I kept saying to my friends maybe I don't like the show because I may be comparing it to those two shows. But no, it seems to me that the show is just really bad.For one, the characters Alexis and David are so over the top, unfunny, unrealistic and annoying.
I actually don't mind Moira or Stevie but everyone and everything else is atrocious.The jokes are so corny and cliche, whilst watching it I couldn't help but that everyone just jumped on the band wagon of saying they love it and made themselves like it?? I don't even know, because it is one of the worst shows I have ever seen in my life.Each episode is boring beyond belief, I truly struggle to get through and episode and that has never happened to me before.I have never written a review before about anything, but I needed to write a review for this awful, awful, awful show."
702,"You could say that in a nutshell, this show is more or less The Beverly Hillbillies in reverse. It's about a rich family that went broke except for a backwater town the father bought his spoiled son for his birthday as a joke, and now they are forced to live there in a two-bit motel. The residents of that town no longer suffer the family's snobbish ways, and they respond to them with some rudeness of their own."
703,"I honestly didn't know what to expect when I first started watching Schitt's Creek. It came up on Netflix and I was bored so I went with it. Each episode is only 30 minutes so why not right? Now I wish each episode were a lot longer. Not only is the show incredibly witty and well-written, but the characters (and the actors who portray them) are absolutely divine. I finished all 3 episodes on Netflix in 2 days and had to find a way to watch the current season. If you're into dry humor this show is absolutely perfect. I watched it with some of my roommates and they didn't laugh out loud the way I do but they did enjoy it. I HIGHLY suggest this show and can't wait for Season 4."
704,"""Schitt's Creek"" is a fish out of water story between an absurdly rich family stuck in a small town in the middle of nowhere. Co- created by Christopher Guest staple Eugene Levy and son Dan Levy, the series is highly watchable and gets a lot of mileage out of a its premise but the show is a little low on laughs and not too much is fleshed out in this world. Similarly, the Rose family has a lot of blanks that no one seems to care about filling in. They're not just wealthy but wealthy to the point of absurdity. The unrealistic arrested development of their kids is reminiscent of ""Step Brothers"" where there are expectations that you'll suspend your disbelief about how people can get that old and know so little about the world. When Dave needs to get a job, he asks if there are any openings in this small town for art curating. An effeminate brat who's likely gay but is restricted to asexuality at the moment (possibly because sex would get in the way of his daily sulking rituals), Dave is the weakest character on the show in that we know only what he doesn't like (being around his sister, the town, daylight) and not what drives him. He would be more at home in the bratty teen comedies of the late 90s than he would in Doc Hollywood. The only thing that interests him is the equally sarcastic hotel worker (Emily Hampshire, MVP of the show) who bonds with him through their mutual love of being jaded adolescents (which, again, seems awkward considering he's over 30).Chris Elliott finds his footing here as the kind of oddball sitcom character that would only exist in a quirky world like this. Maybe it's just me because I saw more Chris Elliott in the '90s than any other decade, but I would have trouble seeing Elliott in a comedy without that old-school quirkiness as opposed to something set in the present day. On the whole, it's still an entertaining show and I'd be on board for a second season."
705,I had to sit through 2 episodes and wasn't close to laughing.
706,"Where do I begin? First I want to say I loved the actors and I think they all played their roles well. But that's where the compliments end. Starting off, the show was a bumpy road and that bumpy road never ended. I almost gave up but decided to watch more seasons. Well I should've just followed my gut because I've wasted my time. Anyone giving this a 10 must have their brains checked. No let me take that back....I've liked terrible shows and movies before so I won't pass judgement. I apologize if i offended you. With that being said, it doesn't change my viewpoints about the show. I'll end with this, the hardest part for me was pretending I liked the show just to appease my wife. Never again."
707,"Just too low-brow for me, not my thing. I prefer my shows to be more uplifting, optimistic, so there is that.I need humor that is more unpredictable, not something that makes me think trailer trash (sorry, I know that term isn't PC, but I did live in a trailer park with my Aunt for a couple years, so I have some experience there).For 7 years I worked at a brokerage firm on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, so I've known more than my share of wealthy/celebrity people who weren't intelligent or self-aware, so that could also be my turn off, too close to my experience. Regardless, if you like it, I won't judge."
708,"I'm super confused by the 'I never stopped laughing!' reviews. Don't get me wrong, I can actually see the appeal, and know people in real life who like it. It's safe, mindless, binge-able, turn-your-brain-off kind of TV. The people who I know that watch this, have a very 'vanilla' sense of humour anyway, so it's right up their street. Saying that, it's no excuse for this show! It is so badly written, it is just plainly not funny! Eugene and Catherine in fairness are probably the best of a bad bunch, but this show has managed to make those two annoying! That's so disappointing as we know what they can do. Could not watch 6 seasons of them whine for 30 full minutes. Dan Levy is the kind of person who, if you worked with him or was his friend, he'd be funny, but that does not mean he should have his own show. Sometimes sarcastic replies and raised eyebrows can't carry a show you know! There's no intelligence or nuance, depth of characters or believability! You can't grow to like them, they are so one-dimensional! TV show writing for Dummies! I actually sat through 2 seasons and 7 episodes and then lost all hope, I gave it more of a chance than most but it just never got funny!"
709,"Nope. By which I mean not good, not funny, not worth your time. Honesty do not understand the hype. Why? Terrible in every sense of the word. Writing: tragic. Acting: meah. You would never quote or reference...ever! Total waste of time! Can't believe this is so highly rated."
710,"Show starts out great, first few seasons an easy 7-8. Season three gets a bit saccharine, and then season four basically takes teenage romance clichés and uses them to compose the dominant theme of the season: David and Patrick's relationship. That story line is just awful, and feels shoehorned into the broader story, and the acting that supports this unfortunate theme is bordering on ridiculous. I winced my way through the season, scrubbing past those sections, and still enjoyed the rest of it, albeit by getting episodes down to the time it takes me to drink my tea."
711,"Yes, a huge winner at the Emmys and everyone on imdb in love with it...but not me, not so much. Too many over-the-top performances. mugging for the camera, repetitious plots...shall I go on? Yes, a couple standout performances, mostly the Schitt kids, but I have seen funnier, laugh out loud series on Prime or Netflix than this one. Fleabag, Mrs. Maisel, others. Sorry to be in the minority here but that's the way it goes."
712,"I almost gave up on this show after the first season. I hated Roland and Stevie and I didn't ""get"" Moira yet. By season two I realized Roland was not the disgusting idiot he initially appeared to be and I ""got"" (and started to love) Moira. As others have said, it was not ""The Office"" but it had its charms.The Good:
Catherine O'Hara's character (especially her way of speaking) was hilarious.
Eugene Levy is priceless (even though his eyebrows are a big distraction).
The show combined elements of several different genres. I am not sure it worked very well, but it was DIFFERENT so I liked it.
The slow revelation that there was much more to Roland that we originally thought.
I loved that David and Alexis shared a room, lol.The Boring:
One season of David's sweaters and Moira's black and white themed outfits was plenty. By the end of the series these things became painful. Stevie's wardrobe was painful from beginning to end.
The coming out story. It has been twenty-three years since the lead character on ""Ellen"" came out. The subject has been covered to death in film and TV. Was the entertainment industry still doing ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" stories twenty-three years later?
Stevie (I found her unlikeable and hated her wardrobe), Twyla and Patrick (one dimensional characters)."
713,"What seemed to be a family journey suddenly became a total David journey. Extremely selfish. a couple with poor or any chemical (David-Patrick). It had an ""happy"" soap opera end, without a real closure for the most nice and well built couple, that was just left behind, evidently not to outshine the bright of the progressivism. Totally out of reality.
Nevertheless, we could see actors in great shapes, that made our time worth, like Catherine O'Hara.
PS: Sorry, English is not my first idiom."
714,"After watching something about this show winning 9 Primetime Emmys and never ever have heard about it before, I decided to give it ago. I remember Eugene Levy from American Pie and Chris Elliott from Scary Movie, and of course Catherine O'Hara, the mother of Kevin in Home Alone.I agree with some others. it does grow on you. But more like a need, than a pleasure, if you get me. It's a nice break-show, a break from the usual you watch on TV. In my opinion not great, but Moira Rose (Overplay alert!!!) and Roland Schitt are the two fun characters I like the most. I also like the pop-up of Ray Butani (Rizwan Manji) here and there.I really can't tell why I watched it all so fast, but it was like I had to, when I first started. It's not extremely funny, it's not always boring, and it's really not that great. But something keeps you watching it.Take a look, if it's sticks it sticks. If not, I'm guessing you're not the only one who didn't make it trough.7/10"
715,"Just don't waste your time etching anything else until you have done all six series.
As good as The Wire in terms of quality. My favourite television ever (alongside The Wire).
The characters, the character development, the humour, the quality of writing, the moments that make you cry, sigh, pause to just soak the richness in.
Please watch this series. You will understand why it got so many Emmys in 2020.
Top notch."
716,One of the most beautiful shows ever! Binge watched the show and just finished the last episode.I have never cried more during any show and never loved and rooted for the characters so much!I wish this show never ended.
717,"Loved the show most of the time Great character, acting and story lines.
The main issue I have is breaking up Alexis and Ted. Alexis was not ready for a fully committed relationship. She then grew into Ted. Realizing he completed her. Many interviews Dan Levy said she needed to be on her own. This is why they broke up. In fact her maturity dictated that this relationship succeed. True love survives challenged such as seperation. He was leaving for 3 years. Not 30 years. They were so quick to end it with the first challenge seeming very rushed and forced. Everyone had a ""happy ending"" except Alexis.
The ending was about pursuing wealth again. Going back to the life that destroyed their humanity. If you factor in covid the hotel franchise would be decimated and Alexis life in NY would fail. Very sad.
The best ending would have been taking roots in Schitts's creek and living a fullfilling life. David and Patrick, Alexis and Ted, Moria and Johnny.
Seasons 1-4 are what made the show with 3 and 4 being the best. Season 5 was okay. Season 6 was the David and Patrick show. Thought I was watching a spin off."
718,"Eugene Levy , Catherine O' hara , pure comic gold .
Well written , funny fish out of water sitcom . Delivers lots of laughs . Odd balls of all sorts , everyone is odd .
Canada knocks this out of the park .A must watch ."
719,Eugene's expressions makes this show 3 times more funny. Very fun to watch.
720,"Just fantastic actors and a great show, the comedy is original and just class, having actors play characters you actually find interesting and wish to follow is just amazing work for the writers and actors. Even outside of comedy what I love about the show is they have some legendary scenes Johnny defending Roland against his base former friends, just class, one of my favorite scenes."
721,"I rarely watch comedy. I can name a few things I've found funny over the years. King of queens, Seinfeld, Curb, Reno 911, Vice Principals. So I found this a few nights ago and didn't feel like searching for hours well after 2 nights I'm almost finished with the third season. I had an epiphany last night I get this show and it gets me. I don't know why I had that feeling but I did. I laughed the most during my last night run. I even rewound some parts over a few times they were that funny. One was the ""right off"" scene. I didn't care for Alexis at first and now she is my fave. I loved David and still do but he can be annoying. I love Johnny as well. Someone mentioned his facial expressions priceless and I love Bob too. It's rare as I said for me to find something in the comedy genre I'll be sad when finished as I don't have a lot of episodes left at this point. I also can't remember a comedy making me shed some tears as well. This is brilliant and I may go to something else for a bit as to not finish it up so soon and as soon as you start this you can't stop so yeah. Any ways give it a go ( 2 to 3 episodes) after you'll be glad you did.
I wanted to edit to add now that I'm further in and also just came upon the awful reviews. People if something is that bad they don't make it for 6 seasons. Understand it may not be for you but it wouldn't last 6 seasons and be nominated like 200 awards and win over 40 if it were Schitt..."
722,"I find myself binge watching this Show and have to use some self discipline when it reaches 2 or 3 in the morning. The acting is bad, the storyline makes you wonder where this is going but it gets better. I love the ep where the son dances to tina turner's song simply the best in front of his boyfriend in their store. Worthwhile watching."
723,"Any show that I can A) watch multiple times and still find funny and B) watch and live in another world easily, deserves all the praise. I can't believe more people haven't seen this."
724,"Very much like the story.made me laughed at many points.love it.
But sad to say ending sucks.They leaving the town is not the thing was in my mind i thought they will stay there.and it's hard to see ted an alaxis break up.you should have stayed them as a couple till end and forever.
Funny,family and better. But ending is awfull."
