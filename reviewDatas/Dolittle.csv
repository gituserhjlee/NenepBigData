0,Had to write a brief review as the level of ignorance regarding RDJ's accent is astounding.As a Welshman I can say his attempt at a Welsh accent is not a bad effort at all. Like many places around the UK we have regional variaions but RDJ does a passable version of a South Wales Valleys accent and that is no mean feat.As far as the plot is concerned you have to remember this is a family film that's full of CGI animals. Was it great? Not quite - but there was enough fun to enjoy if you could get past the the initial shock that Dolittle wasn't from England.Sadly it seems this was too far out of some peoples comfort zones and because of that they missed the hidden meanings of the film which circled around friends and friendship.
1,"You get what you expect with this film - easy to watch and a good laugh from start to finish. As family friendly as a film gets. The cast (both in person and voice over) are of the highest calibre and this only adds to the quality.A note on Downey Jr's Doctors accent - it is a South Wales accent. Not only did I pick up on this immediately, but I would know... being Welsh and having the very accent myself. He pulls it off with a more than decent attempt.To summarise - very good viewing."
2,"No, this is not an Oscar contender.But all the negative reviews are completely unwarranted.This movie is cheesy and fun. It has talking animals. Good guys and bad guys. A love story. Comic relief.It's meant for kids, people. And mine loved it."
3,"I was worried going into this that it would be awful based on early reviews. It turned out to be a delightful, humorous family movie with CGI that would put most films to shame. Yes, there are cheesy over-the-top jokes. Yes, a lot of it is silly. Yes, the plot is simple. It's a movie for children! Robert Downey Jr was charming, Michael Sheen was every bit that classic mustache-twirling villain, and Antonio Banderas surprised me with his performance! The child actors were impressive and believable, and the voice acting was cute and probably the funniest part of the movie. Again, let me say- this is a movie intended for children that can be enjoyed by adults who aren't expecting a drama of the year. Let your inner kid out and see a movie for fun. I thoroughly enjoyed this one!"
4,"If you in for a movie that is just fun and relaxing with a good message about families and helping people out while laughing at silly jokes, this movie is for you. The animals were quite fun with their little jokes and silly comments. My kids really enjoyed it and we thought it was a good family film with a good message. Sit back and enjoy the ride. It's a fun film that everyone can enjoy. Suitable for ages 1 to 101."
5,"If you think this movie was boring or terrible you have no imagination and your inner child is dead old and grumpy. It was delightful, imaginative and enjoyable to watch. I don't understand all the hate for it. Go see it and imagine!"
6,"The negative reviews here are lacking consideration of the viewer such a movie intends to alight and invite in: not film or literature aficionados; children. This movie is perfect for elementary school age kids, entering the genre of film and unawares or wary of the mature themes, titles and classics that flit by in their budding lives. Don't review or see this movie as a critic. Consider it as a parent and carrier of culture, and see it as an amuse bouche for the little blossoming beloved in your life. This film is great."
7,"Critics were already chomping on their pens to ostracize this movie and singularly RDJ. Not playing Tony Stark/Iron Man. Let's just tear him up. Well....I'm no critic. I found Dolittle to be enjoyable,adventurous and entertaining. Big step out of the SUIT of ARMOR and into a raggedy-clothed character who talks to animals. But it's meant to be just that-ENJOYED. Not Oscar,Golden Globe or whatever other award there is.....just enjoyed and entertaining. No crime in that is there?"
8,"This movie is a great, feel-good movie. Why is it so unpopular? The characters are loveable and endearing, the plot easy to follow, and the message sweet and warm. This is definitely the movie to watch if you're feeling down. Dont listen to the haters. Go watch it!"
9,If you want something meaningful and deep watch a Tarantino or Nolan movies. This movie is meant to be for family and fun . And exceeded my expectations.
10,"Stop the haters! Am giving the movie 10 stars to try to get it up to the 6ish it deserves. The movie was funny, well-cast, and an enjoyable story worth the time. I almost didn't watch it thanks to the haters, Dolittle was one of my favorites as a child, so I'm glad I gave it a try. RDJ's accent and characterization were excellent. Banderas and Thompson? Brilliant! The flatulence and poop jokes? Have any of the haters spent time with children lately? Such jokes will never grow old, is our very human way of coping with our very animalistic nature. Everybody poops, y'all. And everybody feels pain and loss yet survives in community and friendship and love. We're all in this together."
11,"Great Entertainment , VfX are amazing. And you will laugh Every 10 mins. RDJ Is Heart Of This Movie. You Will Miss Iron Man In Him But You Will Be Satisfied By His Role in this Movie. Must Watch . Kids Will Love It And Adults Will Enjoy It .
Don't Go With Critics . Anyone can sit and review movie . Must watch movie 8.5-10"
12,"Solid family adventure movie and have multiple funny moments. Story is quite predictable, at least not boring.
Main cast is every kind of well animated animals."
13,"To all the ""professional"" reviewers from the online news sites. You seem to have lost your inner child. I loved this movie. When I was 7 years old I saw the 1967 Dr Dolittle and it left a life long impression. Robert Downey Jnr and his team have done an exceptionl job in not trying to recreate that movie but by bringing more to the story. My suggestion is go and watch this movie as if you are still 7 years old, open your mind, your heart and your imagination. You will not regret it."
14,"This movie is not at all what I was expecting, RDJ does a beautiful job of the eccentric crazy Dr."
15,It's a good movie to watch with your family. It's not going to win an Oscar or by all means any award; But it's a heartfelt and funny movie. My family really enjoyed it. It's nice to sit and watch a decent movie with decent acting. Go watch it it's not as bad as the reviews on here make it seem.
16,"If you are going to watch a movie with a child, you can choose this movie. I also watched versions of Eddie Murphy. This movie is more beautiful. Scenarios and jokes are better. Visual effects are realistic."
17,"I just saw the movie and I can't understand why people hate it. It's funny, heartwarming and has beautiful images. RDJ is once again great showing us a different side of his acting. Don't forget this is a kids movie and it has to be more loose and cringe (for adults) sometimes."
18,"Probably one of the best 2020 movie for children and parents. Beautiful sceneries and amazing cgi! Don't listen to the usual phony critics who made their life criticizing about everything they watch, hear or see others do 😜😷"
19,"This movie is really fun for children, and the whole family at that. Surely, it lacks complexity and innovativeness, but these qualities we appreciate in sci-fi action thrillers and dramas, not this kind of works. Anyway, it's worth the time."
20,"This is one of those films that brings a lot nostalgia back to mind. I like the concept these people are going with here. A Dr. Dolittle remake would be perfect especially the time right now. I know people have mixed feelings about this, but I like it."
21,"Its a great family movie, my son is 4yo, doesnt speak english, but really enjoy the movie.."
22,"It was fun to watch, the animals CGI was done so beautifully, to the extent that I never really thought it's CGI. Voice actors were brilliant and RDJ was AMAZING.
A lot of love for animals that was so heart warming and we laughed alot. A lottt!"
23,Another film the critics can't grasp its a film designed for families and children not for the serious explorer or vet enjoy some family time and they will easy up to this type of film
24,I went in reluctantly a big fan of the originals especially after seeing the rating on here beforehand however it was honestly a breath of fresh air. They haven't tried to rip the originals off and it is a completely different take. Honestly heartwarming from start to finish with just the right amount of laughs along the way and some fantastic special effects. One of the best family films I've seen in a good long while.
25,"It's rare to find a true children's film, but DOLITTLE touches the heart and one must remember what it is like to be a child and find wonder in the world. This film is Enchanting, beautifully realized and acted, and above all .... endearing."
26,"Great like the books, I'm excited to bring this one home for my kids to watch with. It's funny, witty, and adventurous."
27,"Stephen Gaghan's re-imagining of the classic character gifted with the ability to talk to animals brings it back to its storybook origins, where Dolittle is a famed doctor veterinarian in 19th-century Victorian England. Based on the second of Hugh Lofting's Doctor Dolittle books, 'The Voyage of Doctor Dolittle', it follows the doctor on a quest to a mythical island to find a cure for the Queen Victoria (Jessie Buckley), who has been poisoned by the conniving Lord Badgley (Jim Broadbent) and Dolittle's enemy Doctor Mudfly (Michael Sheen).That quest is also intended as emotional closure for Dolittle, whom we are told in the animated prologue had secluded himself behind the high walls of Dolittle Manor following the death of his wife Lily (Kasia Smutniak) seven years ago. Not only does Dolittle have to come out of hiding, the mission also requires him to retread Lily's fateful voyage, before she was lost in a storm out at sea. It also gets personal for Dolittle in other ways, including having to come face to face with Rassoulim (Antonio Banderas) and the ferocious tiger Barry (Ralph Fiennes).Not that much of it matters; in the hands of director and co-writer Gaghan, 'Dolittle' is little more than a series of frantic set-pieces under the guise of a swashbuckling adventure. That freneticism is also as a result of a whole menagerie of animals which Dolittle brings along on his voyage - including an insecure gorilla (Rami Malek), a bouncy polar bear (John Cena), a quarrelsome duck (Octavia Spencer), and a wise macaw (Emma Thompson) - that are constantly fighting for attention and screaming over each other in order to be heard.Each scene is as messy as you can imagine, with little point except to create enough distraction to keep the younger ones among the audience entertained with the non-stop bickering. Worse, these non-human characters seem to be all over the scene at the same time, often either eclipsing Dolittle or making him seem utterly inconsequential. It doesn't help that there is little depth to each one of the non-human characters, even with a whole bunch of Hollywood A-listers assembled to give them voice, especially since they are simply given one single defining trait and nothing more.Much of the blame unfortunately lies with Gaghan. The Oscar-winning writer of such geopolitical fare as 'Traffic' and 'Syriana' seemed to us an odd choice to direct such a special-effects heavy family movie when he was first attached, and the results prove that he is truly and completely out of his league. Not only are the jokes unfunny, the action is terribly unexciting and uninvolving, and not even the purportedly late salvage attempts by 'TMNT' director Jonathan Liebersman and 'The Lego Movie' writer Chris McKay can turn around what is essentially a misguided movie from the very start.As much as we like RDJ, there is only so much the charismatic actor can do with such an underwritten role. Though the plotting promises a poignant journey for Dolittle coming to terms with the loss of his beloved wife, that proves to be no more than a convenient device in the scheme of the overall narrative, raised only when expedient to remind us that there is more to the man than his eccentricities. Oh yes, it should come as no surprise that RDJ brings his trademark playful yet confident air to the character, but even that is no match for the sheer commotion that follows him around the entire movie, no thanks to the incessant cacophony of his animal companions.Much bad press has preceded the release of 'Dolittle', and unfortunately those rumours aren't simply speculation. There is frankly little charm to this feverishly chaotic movie, which seems modelled after the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' series but is hardly able to muster the same idiosyncratic appeal. It is little secret that 'Dolittle' aims to create a new franchise for RDJ after 'Avengers', but we can't see why anyone would want to put themselves through this headache-inducing muddle again. As unlikely as it sounds, we'd take the Eddie Murphy movies over this anytime."
28,"The 5 of us in 3 generations went to see Doctor Dolittle today and completely enjoyed it from start to finish. Maybe critics don't like movies with a coherent plot. I don't know. Maybe they don't like RDJ's success at the moment.
Ignore them and go see this movie.
I read a crtiic's review of the dragon scene and wondered about it. Must have been a very uptight person who wrote it as there was nothing untoward about the scene and even the 8 year old got a good laugh out of it. Living creatures have tummy issues that can hurt and sometimes produces gas. Maybe the critic has too much gas and needs to release it.
Is there a doctor in the house?
Cheers"
29,"Saw the preview. I enjoyed it as much as the 5 year old! Solid Adventure Tale, with good humor unlikable characters. I think Robert Downey Junior did an awesome job, considering he was pretty much acting alone for most of the filming! Strong younger actors as well. As long as you don't mind the mixing of modern phrasing and jokes in a film set many many years ago, you'll do just fine."
30,"If you don't take Dolittle too seriously I'm sure you'll find enough enjoyment in the experience. It's really a family film, probably aimed at kids in the 6-12 demographic. It's got a few good laughs and it's a feel good adventure. Is it amazing? No, but it's not a bad way to spend a couple of hours."
31,I actually don't know why there is so much hate. I thought that this was a lovely family movie. Colourful and enjoyable.
32,"A funny family film. Great for children and adults to smile at.
Just think Sunday afternoon"
33,I enjoyed it. They need to make more positive movies like this.
34,"The movie had fun with building up special, warm moments and then crashing them with humor. My kids, wife and I had a blast. Lots of funny moments, perfect for kids, very well made with an old charm feel. Oh and it's not one of those sad Free Willy type movies where things die either."
35,"Have no idea why this film is getting so much hate!! Its brilliantly entertaining my 4 year old loves it and can follow the plot which is why I cant understand why it is confusing some adults!! 😂 I am unsure of what people were expecting, it has action, adventure, humour and Robert Downey Junior, what else do you want people!! And just to point out, hes doing a WELSH accent people and not a bad attempt at that!"
36,"Enjoyed this movie so much and my rating is 10/10 of course !! Funny moments and dialogues made me laugh, The CGI was so good as like as the acting. Totally worth my time, Thanks for making such an Amazing movie..."
37,"Dolittle is a remake/reboot of the Dr Dolittle that has been done many times by many different people. This time the Animal whisperer doctor is played by Robert Downey Jr. One of my favorite parts of this film is Antonio Banderas, his performance is very good for what he has to work with. RDJ does a decent job in this movie, but I felt sometimes his accent was a little weird and it wasn't always consistent throughout the movie.This film is very cliche and the story goes almost exactly where you would expect it to go, and is a perfect January movie release, as I watched I almost felt as though I was watching a Disney Channel movie."
38,"Dolittle boasts an all-time great (predominantly voice) cast, but wastes its talent on an all-time abhorrent script. It will likely do enough to keep your kids entertained, but the lazy jokes and awkward performances will prove a chore to sit through for the rest of us."
39,"Poorly cut scenes mar what could have been a fun adventure. By the end of the film I couldn't name a single character aside from the protagonist. No character development occurred anywhere so I didn't feel a connection with any of the characters. Most of the time I couldn't tell who was speaking because all of the voices sounded as though they were coming from a sound stage. The editing shows that there were reshoots and questionable choices. The opening ten minutes were so jarring that I can list this as the first movie to make me carsick. Underneath all of the issues could have been a great story, but I couldn't even get my 7 year old daughters to take an interest in this lackluster film. I even had to leave the room at one point because it gave me a headache."
40,There is nothing awesome about dolittle film. The only good part about this film is the special effects in making the animals look perfectly realistic. The story was very vague and there really wasn't any humor in this film. Mostly a film made for children only and not really an adult's cup of tea.
41,". I don't understand the terrible reviews and I getting sick of these bad reviews on these movies making me feel hesitant to go see them. The CGI's were awesome, rdj played this weird animal talking guy well. It was very interesting and I couldn't stop watching. Even shed a tear at one point."
42,"Far more accurate to the source material than the last attempts at making a Dr Dolittle, this movie has a heart that the toyetic, brand-led movies of today frequently lack. No, it's not an Oscar contender but I was still thoroughly entertained. There were many sweet moments, nothing too scary for young ones to see and some cute animal antics that had children in the theatre laughing. If Downey jr hadn't put on the Welsh accent, you can be sure people would have complained that he was just doing Sherlock Holmes again. Only a Welsh speaker will be able to confirm the accents accuracy but all those American critics saying they don't know what was going on with his accent and that he sounds 'bizarro,' stupid or weird are just putting their own ignorant bigotry on display. On the technical aspects of film making, such as lip-syncing the ADR, this movie falls down, which is why it loses a star, but average movie goers probably won't even care, especially in the foreign markets where it will be over-dubbed anyway. Honestly, the ADR didn't bother me and I was still able to immerse myself in the story. The CGI animals looked fine. One of the biggest complaints about 'The Lion King' was that the photo-realistic animals couldn't emote enough. Now critics complain that these animals look too cartoonish. It's a case of damned if you do and damned if you don't. I liked that the animals showed personality. The climax, while on a surface level appears to be a simple fart joke, is also a touching scene centred around building a connection with an enemy rather than 'dehumanising' them. Looking deeper it shows a sweet display of professionalism and empathy in the face of the disgusting side effects of illness, something many carers can identify with. Overall it's a fun, sweet adventure."
43,"The movie has wonderful costumes, interesting characters, sassy and sparkling lines, a rather predictible plot but a nice story told in a very nnice way."
44,"What a great movie it is, the cinematography is prefect and captivating. I just love this adventure bcz it brings us back to our nostalgic childhood when we used to love these types of pictures👍"
45,"It wasn't that bad, it did seem a little rushed but my kids loved it. Great shots, super cinematic and great ending. Worth a watch if renting"
46,"What a shame you can't give a zero. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen.Robert Downey Jr trying to perform with what he considers to be a Welsh accent is excruciating. Joanna Page, who is actually Welsh, must have cringed through everything scene she was in.A bunch of rats quoting The Godfather is just embarrassingly bad. It's pointless. It does nothing for the film. Likewise, an African American squirrel that lives in the English countryside and quotes Star Trek.The piece d'resistance however, is the dragon (yes, a common or garden fire breathing dragon) to which Dolittle gives an enema with a leek forcing it to poop out some bagpipes.I wish this was a joke review. Unfortunately, it's all true"
47,I personally loved Dolittle. I family movie with lots of laughter and joy. I recommend.
48,Struggled to hold me attention from 10 mins in. Just seemed lazy to me.
49,"Lets be real here, we all thought Dolittle would flop. However i have seen it. It is magical and wonderful. Good for all the family. 9/10."
50,"First of all, this is NOT a little kids movie! I doubt they'd understand the one-liners or get the humor. Also I think they'd be bored with the grownup talk. Next, forget any review you read that gives some highbrow, snotty reason why you shouldn't see this movie. It was simply great FUN and has many laugh out loud moments. Indeed it took a minute to reconcile ""Tony Stark"" as this weird, eccentric dude who talks to animals but he does a great job. And the animals were so entertaining and funny! We weren't looking to be educated or lectured at, we wanted to see a funny movie...and we certainly did. Definitely going again next weekend."
51,"Dolittle seems like a wonderful and delightful kids movie. Doctor Dolittle and all his animal friends have emotional issues that they are working through, and this can only serve to help kids learn how to express similar feelings they might be having.Dolittle is basically a Doctor Who movie where The Doctor is sad instead of angry. He, his companion and his animal friends go on a grand adventure where everyone finds healing for their emotional issues.I understand storywise why Lady Rose stays with the Queen instead of going on the adventure, but I think it would have been a better movie if both kids had been companions to The Doctor.A lot of people spend a lot of ink trying to place the accent Robert Downey Jr. is doing and that misses the point. He's doing a unique Dolittle accent in a fantasy movie with a fantasy England where his character can talk to animals.It feels like they were aiming at the absurd art direction of Netflix's A Series of Unfortunate Events but that their art director wasn't as good. Slightly. Or maybe someone was pulling on the reigns and saying they were going too far, and that the movie about talking animals needed to be more realistic."
52,"This was a fun family-friendly movie, full of little story lines and character development like getting over fears and following your passions wherever they might lead. Also included was different ways of coping with loss. Loved this movie a lot!"
53,"This is easily the worst movie of 2020. Much of the credit falls squarely on the shoulders of Robert Downey Junior. Downey is horribly miscast as the gentle English Doctor. I can only assume that the producers have never read any of the classic Childrens books about Dr. Dolittle. Considering how incredibly bad this movie is, I wonder if they have the ability to read. When the script starts to fail... they throw in more special effects. There are a lot of special effects in this movie."
54,"Bad acting, bad scenes, bad movie! The toilet humour is completely unnecessary and just adds to the pointlessness of this release."
55,"This insipid pile of cinematic excrement that calls itself an adaptation of Dr Dolittle is a biblical screw up of the highest order. Littered with terrible jokes, the charm of a duck with schizophrenia and deserves to be called the first WORST movie of 2020. Not even Robert Downey Jr could salvage this mess, in fact it's like the script was stopping him from having any charisma whatsoever and oh GOD the script is a squishy glob of diarrhea. Every time the movie tried to be funny I almost passed out with how much it physically hurt me, and the CGI is plain wonky, especially for a movie that has a $175 MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET. How can you poor so much money into something that looks THAT bad??? Please stay away from Dolittle, it is pure cinematic torture and the fact that RDJ couldn't even save it is a good indicator of its quality."
56,"Great movie for family because its actually made for children! if you expect RDJ to have a suit or some action then this movie is not for you, the stories are easy to catch and kids seems enjoying this movie! love it good work."
57,We found this movie magical and moving and left the theater wanting to watch it again.
58,"This movie was fun from start to finish. Lots of laughs, a grand adventure, some heartfelt moments...it was a perfect family movie."
59,"Lovely to leave a movie feeling wonderful! Go see it! I laughed, I cried, I was surprised and I felt great!"
60,"Let say first thing this movie is so so boring.i just don't understand y Downey select this garbage script so do other actor I guess they wanted to see a assemble of A list actors with different visual effect and check if that work or not well if u don't have a good script this Alist won't work.
I have to take some headache medicine"
61,"Most enjoyable film in a while.
Great set of actors making a truly enjoyable movie, very funny."
62,The mystery is how this ever made it to a theatrical release. Just abysmal.
63,"It's not often that one gets a fresh take on children's stories and it was with some trepidation hat I attended a screening of 'Dolittle'. My fears, however, were unfounded as I was totally blown away by the Downey Team's take on this delightful character and his mottley crew of animals.The interaction between the eccentric Dr Dolittle (who has now become a recluse) and his only friends in the world involves the most amusing repartee; in addition, the introduction of an 'apprentice' and the search for the cure to save HRH - the Queen of England provides a twist not previously encountered in a cinematic rendition of the classic tales.A tiger who needs psychiatric treatment; a dragon with indigestion; an insecure gorilla and insects who are spies are but some of the characters who are guaranteed to cause a giggle. Of course, Dolittle's ride on the back of an ostrich will be a memory which will be etched in your memories.This is definitely one trip to the cinema NOT to be missed!"
64,I don't get it why everyone is hating this moive it has the perfect cast and a good story and some teacher and student relationship and good CG and VFX I mean it's really good
65,"Besides the movie being slightly rushed at some parts of the movie. It was such a wonderfully nostalgic movie for me. Especially considering the fact that I was able to watch the 1967 version with Rex Harrison in it. Robert Downey Jr did such a beautiful job as Dr. Dolittle along with the rest of the cast doing just as much of a beautiful job. The only real complaint that I had was that it was slightly rushed from time to time, but it wasn't that often which I can appreciate very much. I hope to recommend this to many other people and their children if they're up to watching this movie as well."
66,"In a time of predictable, formulated movies Dolittle is a refreshing story with an incredible message regarding the power of empathy, encouragement and kindness. Whether facing the poignancy of loss and disillusionment, or individual shortcomings, this movie is a reminder of the influence unquestioning acceptance, loyalty and support have in overcoming any adversity. Wonderfully unique and up-lifting."
67,"Dolittle despite having impressive cast,good voice acting and solid animation ,felt flat this film made some wrong decisions in filmaking,it intruduced few of storylines that after some time are left abondend and never mentioned again also i think that robert was miscasted here,i mean i love robert as actor but this role more suits for depp or some of his type ,it was weird to see RDJ acts so over the top,all of that also didnt help film to have big rewatchibilite as i dont see myself watching it again in near future,i cant compare this film to murphy films since i also didnt watched them in long time but i remember that i had more fun with them maybe becase they were made in a right time for it,and not today,films with talking animals are just old fashioned and they hold up anymore"
68,"Super fun, funny ,....well written! Hope their is a sequel."
69,"Movie is enjoyable only for once, although ending could have been better. One most important thing is missing from this movie is surprise element, whole movie is pridictable."
70,"A light-hearted, funny, found-family fun. Enjoyable for all ages."
71,"I have been a Robert Downey Jr. fan for many years through his ups and downs from ""less than zero"", through his meteoric rise with his Iron Man character. There's a certain wit and charm that he brings to his roles that I find very entertaining. Overall it was a fun movie to watch and I would recommend this film to all ages. Everyone will have a favorite animal, but I like Chi-Chi the best, a great ape that is afraid of life. Enjoy!"
72,"This was a really good movie of cource it had its problems but it was a great cast, great story and i had a blast. It is not something you have to watch but if you went to The movies this is a good choice"
73,"I must admit I watch this movie together with my 12 years old daughter. And I found it's one of the best movies since recent years, my daughter rate it high as 9 score.(she is picky than me.)As a mom I must educate my daughter about something important for her future life's choices. The reasons we enjoy it, is it's magically very good at bringing back those values which are losing in many movies, like love, magical, compassion, friendship, kindness, forgiveness, brave, accept yourself, never give up, care about animals, etc. These values are very hard to find in mass media products nowadays. I don't want any violence or sexual/abuse content for her movies, but movies really changed a lot, I always need to borrow some movies from library made even 20 years ago. Younger girls now like makeup YouTubers, chatting for crush all the time, don't care about responsibilities of society, studying, future or care about other people very much.I feel this movie made us very happy and comfortable, if you like X-Man, Star Wars, and you are expecting special effects, or something can make you feel very exciting, maybe you won't like it. If you wanna enjoy the soothing with your girlfriend, or educate your children what is good and bad, what about love and forgiveness, fame and money are not important which also cannot exist long, and can never exchange happiness, you will love this movie."
74,"Given RDJs back catalog and how he can run a film I was hoping for a bit more from this.
Don't get me wrong, I mean it's an easy family film, I just hoped he would make it bit more than just that. It almost felt that he was kind of holding back at points to make sure it was nice for children.
Overall it isn't a bad kids film, it's a lot better than the Eddie Murphy vision but it lacks the magic of the Rex Harrison Doolittle."
75,"This film is a poop stain on the underpants of film. A movie about a doctor who can speak to animals somehow turns into an adventure to save the queen of england where a dragon attacks and they solve the problem by performing a colonoscopy and ripping bagpipes out of his butthole. Oh wait, I forgot the dragon farts before the bagpipes get ripped out. Robert Downey Jr delivers the worst performance of the decade and his accent is laughably bad. Take some friends if you want to laugh out loud. 1/10."
76,"Bad CGI, bad accent, horrible cast, silly plot, worthless dialogue and just garbage from the word go."
77,"I have no idea why this movie is getting negative reviews.
Took my 5 year old to a pretty full theatre.
Many laughs throughout the movie with an applause at the end of the film.
Kids left with smiles . Parents were even expressing to each other how much they enjoyed the movie.
To me, it doesn't get any better than that."
78,"Apart from it being a pretty poor movie. That didn't mash together correct at all. With some poor cgi. His attempt at a welsh accent, not British (that covers England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales) is terrible. If you think he's doing a bad British voice and thinking of England. Then I'm not surprised your thinking of that as your in the wrong place."
79,"The character of Dr. Doolittle is thoroughly unlikeable, he just seems self absorbed and unpleasant . The part should have gone to Michael Sheen who at least would have had the accent right. I also thought the baddie was Simon Pegg initially- which would have worked. Also the young girl who is set up as a love interest for the boy? 🤢 The accents were all over the place, my children who are 10 and 8 didn't have a clue about that the Queen was being poisoned. Really disappointed but sorry, too curlingly bad. 👎"
80,"175 Million Dollars to make this Downey's fee must have been 174 million due to the standard of the C.G.I and accompanying cast, by the way I watched it for free and I still want my money back.
Do yourself a favour and watch the Rex Harrison, Samantha Eggar, Version it is mile better than this trash."
81,"It's a fun time for a family? Nope. This movie is so bad that cats looks cute compere to this. Robert Downey Jnr fans will love this movie they will request an Oscar, probably for best supporting actor.Don't try to watch that crap. Waste of money."
82,"An average movie, that adds nothing to the Dolittle story.
The human cast pretty much phoned it in.Definitely aimed at the younger audience, who would appreciate the action and humour."
83,"A totally bland, predictable addition to the bargain bin. I'd put it on in the background to keep any particularly dull animal company while you're out of the house"
84,"Unclear why this did not get a better rating. Acting is very good, plot is imaginative and action packed. We loved every minute."
85,"First off for the people saying it's a kid movie not adults cup of tea.... hello its rated pg what did you think. Plus my husband and I loved it! So did our kids, they need to make more of the old movies for kids to watch now a days!! Absolutely loved it!!"
86,"With this being Robert Downey Jnr's first project since leaving the role of Iron Man I had some intrigue in seeing this film and I now have and this is my review for Dolittle. The premise of the film sees an eccentric doctor who can talk to animals dragged on a journey by a young boy in order to save a persons life.
Main Character
As mentioned Robert Downey Jnr plays the lead in this film and I think he does an okay job in this film, he still has quite a bit of charm and charisma about him and there is a bit of an emotional arc his character has to go through in the film that does work. However, I felt like his accent really didn't fit this character and made him a bit difficult to understand at times also honestly throughout the film he isn't the most likeable character in my opinion and I did at times find it difficult to root for him and care about his character.
Supporting Characters
Out Of all the animals there was really only one I grew to really like and that was Rami Malek as the Gorilla Chee - Chee, he was very loveable and charming and I actually enjoyed watching his character develop throughout the film, it was probably the most enjoyable part of the film. Antonio Banderas also has a fun role in the film and I liked his character in the film and his fun interactions with Downey Jnr. However, I never really grew to care about any of the other animals in the film even though they are voiced by some big Hollywood actors such as Emma Thompson, Tom Holland & John Cena. Also the boy that accompanies Dolittle isn't particularly good and doesn't provide a strong performance in the film but that is probably due to the weak script that is given.
Story
The story has a few characters go through interesting development in the film such as Dolittle and Chee-Chee which just about gives this subject the benefit of the doubt. But this film has a very predictable and boring plot, there are no curveballs and no interesting plot twists to invest the viewer and is just a simple journey to watch.
Script
As I said earlier the script is really weak in this film, there are a few chuckle worthy moments but the majority of it fails to land and the drama just doesn't work aswell as it truly could and that is because of the clear aim at pleasing children which weakens this film.
Style
The film has some vibrant colours and is definitley pleasing on the eye to look at, with some impressive set pieces in it aswell. But I felt like the tone of the film was a bit all over the place, every time the film tried something dramatic it ruined it by putting in an unneccessary joke that just totally ruins the dramatic moment.
Overall
This film was pretty much what I expected, a below average colourful film that could be a good time for families but as a film it isn't particularly good and isn't worth a watch unless you are trying to entertain the children."
87,"This movie doesn't deserve your money there were young children in my cinema who were writhing with boredom. this is the type of movie that will craft a scene and later write unfunny jokes into them, this especially becomes obvious when a duck starts calling him dodolitlle instead of dolittle which led to many people to burst out laughing in my cinema for the wrong reasons. i can say i smiled unsarcastically at 2 jokes throughout the whole film so it comes as no surprise to me to learn that there were extensive reshoots to make the film 'funnier'. i would be very interested in seeing the unfunny version of this film. robert downey juniors accent is so bad i was wanting subtitles and the cgi is so bad that it almost distracts you from just ho terrible the script is. the trailer misleads you into thinking you're seeing some really cool adventure film but instead we have farting animals, animals kicking each other in the balls and ex iron man pulling bag pipes out of a dragons backside (i'm not joking). to be honest this movie could be great fun if you want to get some friends around and get some drinks but unfortunately that's the only situation i can see this movie not being a colossal piece of garbage. take your kids to see sonic, that at least has a cohesive script which is more than i can say about this waste of time"
88,"I wanted to give it a shot despite the bad ratings, because... Robert Downey junior. I was wrong"
89,"Should never have been made. What is the awful accent Robert Downey Jnr is trying to portray?! So many plot holes, just ridiculous and not entertaining at all."
90,This movie seemed like it was rushed and didnt have a fun feel to it. Just blah. The actors didn't seem into it!
91,"The movie is good fun, with Robert Downey Jr. and his whimsical fairy-tale like adventure. The animals all have differing personalities, you get a good laugh. If you want to enjoy this movie, let your inner child out. But that's when the climax comes. I don't know what crack these so-many-times hired writers were on, but at what point did they think that the most expensive fart joke would be able to save this movie? SOME ONE had to write that scene, SOME ONE had to animate it, and ROBERT had to act it. And did I mention, its the climax? That scene, I don't really think, is ""family-friendly"". Also, this isn't a spoiler. It's in the trailer itself. Yes, its the scene were Robert gets air blown on his face."
92,"It felt a little bit like a Disney movie but the CGI wasn't bad, i have never watched the dr do little previous reboots before this one but all of the actors did pretty well, i loved RD.jr's role in this movie for character. I knew what to expect when watching this movie which was colorful, simple, funny and adventurous and it didn't disappoint for me. Im 26 year old no kids but the humor still got me and it did keep the movie interesting until the end, i am an animal loving person and an introvert so i really could click with the story and characters. Maybe its not a movie for everyone if you are expecting more out of the plot or the actors compared to previous or other movie titles but i certainly found it enjoyable, definitely something for all ages to watch. It gives out a good message to children and adults and it certainly gave me good vibes."
93,"My 8 year old son and I enjoyed this movie. It was cute and funny. I think the people who gave Doolittle super low ratings missed that this is a kids movie; it isn't supposed to have intellectual dialogue or a complicated story.
If you go to this movie expecting a cute kids movie, you will enjoy it."
94,"Dolittle lived up to is name and did very little. It had all the elements to be a good fun family film but failed, the animals were all cute and funny and the plot had promise but it just didn't hang together. And Robert Downey's welsh accent was a bit suspect and at times hard to understand. Disappointing 2.5 stars
George: when I saw the trailer I thought this would be like Rex Harrison's Dr Dolittle but as it turned out I couldn't understand the story and the soundtrack was too loud. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. 2 stars (but I still enjoyed being at the
Movies)"
95,"Dolittle is a passable film with a concrete plot and vast, colorful settings. While the film may not have the same appeal for adults, the animals are well done and the comedy is simple which should make the movie a good time for younger audiences. Robert Downey Jr. as the titular Dolittle felt underutilized as a whole, and no other performances really stuck out."
96,"Youre out standing next to the hot dog stand putting some hope into your life. The need to eat food comes at you like frozen water in the shape of a football. Unavailable alternatives. Youre stranded there and a floating tuba floats next to you. So its time to investigate just like sherlock himself, just like the alfa male, charming and proud. So you walk the tuba down, low strided dainty steps (hamster). But you walk passed it and it stops when you do that and says: please conform, please. Youre on your way to the ocean, having decided that sherlock holmes is for other people, people who are good at liking it. Your hands start to form into fish hands. On the way back into the water you say: my brides are all my unfiltered thoughts, which consist of a snowman nervously chasing a ford truck and instantly starting to float up at 90° into the sky. Which provides an image of the sunset and a flying object."
97,"The film was awesome.
Don't know why people are underestimating it. vfx was awesome. Robert downy jr did amazing acting. Do not be deceived by the deception of people, do watch this movie once. This movie is like Jungle Book."
98,"Look, if u can allow yourself to disengage from the Hollywood and critic insanity for a while and just relax and have some fun.... as a family, then this is for you. We all loved it. We laughed throughout and all enjoyed our afternoon! Is it ""war and peace""? No. Is it a ""complex treatise on anything""? No. But again, if you want to relax and smile and have some fun.. this is for u. Ignore the haters. Everything doesn't need to be a ""mental journey."" It's Dr. Doolittle. Manage your expectations. Grab some popcorn and spend two hours in stress free elegance."
99,"My family and I thought this was a very good movie. The only distraction was Robert Downey Jr.'s weird British accent. For a guy who could formerly do a very convincing British accent, and has done it many times in the past, I'm not sure what happened here. I'm reminded of Keanu Reeves' Jonathan Harker portrayal in Bram Stoker's Dracula. Otherwise, it's a very charming, feel-good movie."
100,"I love this film but for some reason Octavia Spencer sounds like Tiffany Haddish which is fine because I very much enjoy both actresses' work but there is something about Dab-Dab that doesn't fit into the ""period' of the film (Queen Victoria era) or the Country. Obviously each actor/actress brings their own qualities to each of the animals and they are all fantastic, but Dab-Dab stands out. I don't quite know how to explain it but Dab-Dab is distracting and I can't figure out why. This is probably the most oddly written confusing review I've ever posted, but I feel like if Dab-Dab's voice were different in some way the character would be less distracting. There is nothing wrong with standing out, perhaps Dab-Dab is exceptional, or maybe it was just the audio settings at the theater, but Dab-Dab's dub/vocal took me out of the period (the intended era). That makes ZERO sense I know, and I'm sorry. But RDJ of course is fantastic."
101,"While the animation wasn't exactly up-to-par with most other major CGI movies of the last few years, I thought the story was very captivating and the animals were so funny. I don't understand why people aren't liking the movie. I recommend."
102,"This is a lively, action filled movie with great pace. You can watch it with the children or the grandparents. Everyone in the theater was laughing out loud many times. We were shocked to see no children present at the theater because this definitely designed with families in mind.Stay past the first set of credits."
103,"Remember that horrible talking animal movie call Zookeeper with Kevin James? This is just like that, animals making very annoying and unfunny comedy, RDJ is a great actor but that accent is just bad, and this movie has one of the worst things involving a dragon that has ever been put in a film. It is just straight up gross what they do to this dragon at the end of this movie.Anyways, RDJ is great but damn, talking animal movies usually suck, the only really good ones are Mr.Fox, Babe 1, and maybe a few I am missing.This is just very annoying, and I hate it when a movie says ""Say hello to my little friend."" That line should NEVER EVER be spoken in a film again.Anyways, 1/10"
104,"In this day and age I expected more.
Lame acting and generally lousy film. I am so surprised that certain actors agreed to do this."
105,"This movie has been re-edited that many times it makes Frankenstein monster's stitches seem seamless. It's all over the place, in tone and humor. And if that wasn't bad enough, we have to endure Downey Jr's accent that comes straight from the Dick Van Dyke's school of chalkboard."
106,"I knew nothing of the negative reviews of Dolittle before seeing it. However, I looked at dozens of them as soon as the movie ended because I wanted to know if anyone thought it was as terrible as I do. Rarely do I agree with professional critics when it comes to movies, but they are 100% correct this time. This movie is a dumpster fire. It isn't enjoyable at all. It's certainly aimed at the young crowd, but is terrible by even those standards.I don't understand why several audience reviews are saying this movie is actually good. I can only imagine that they're such big fans of RDJ that they think he can do no wrong. But he couldn't save this movie even if he tried.The CGI is great in some scenes, but terrible in most. The dialogue is absurdly lame, even if meant for kids (seriously, it's god awful ).The way scenes are edited together looks like something you would see in a home movie, not a professional studio production. The plot is half-hearted and barely makes sense. The constant, overdubbed dialogue makes you cringe. And honestly, the entire movie is just plain boring, which you think would be hard to do since there are talking animals, pirates, and freakin' Robert Downey Jr!!!It's as if someone intentionally sabotaged this film. Wait a few months and watch it for free if it's something you want to check out for yourself. But for all things sacred and holy, please do not spend money on it...."
107,"REVIEW - DOLITTLEHow the once mighty Iron Man has fallen, from saving the universe to saving a squirrel!And the accident!Follow the exploits of Dolittle (very apt title if you ask me because it certainly seems that Iron Man did little at all, just show up and get paid) as he and his merry band of animals go on an adventure to find a remedy for the queen.I say the word follow but honestly you just don't care about what happens to whome and by the end I just thought was that it?Of course its not made for a 50+ man it's made for the kiddies and as I'm not of the age this is aimed at I can't give you that opinion but as a grown up if you are taking your kids to see this use it to catch up on your sleep, I felt my eye lids dropping.Rating 5 out of 10"
108,"I'm surprised with the negative reviews on this film. Yes, it is a Disney-like film. Not everyone appreciates these type of films, but if you're into these films, then this movie is certainly for you. It was a great family film that will surely keep you laughing with quite a few Oohs and Aahs in between. It's excellent for kids and for the kids at heart."
109,"It's a light- hearted pure family entertainer. Visual effects were great and, as usual, amazing performances by RDJ and Antonio Banderas.
People forget that it's target audience are the children and they love it!
Definietly worth a watch!"
110,I and children's spend great time at the cinema. It wasn't boring even for me.
111,"Even if we lower our expectations to the lowest (for babies and kids), this movie still failed miserably. The cast's performance is stiff and awful, as if they have never been through any acting education at all.Shout out to the director and Robert Downey: Don't take kids too lightly! Kids these days actually have standards!!"
112,"Some reviewed this movie and stated it had multiple funny moments, I wonder, what damn movie was he or she watching, cause it sure wasn't this garbage pit. First off, this movie was grossly cast wrong, the lead role screamed for Johnny Depp, but Robert Downey Jr, figured as executive producer, he'd rely on Iron Man fame to draw a crowd, was he ever wrong on that. I read they make remake this movie, if so I hope the fire the writers of the last one, hire Johnny Depp for the lead character, and get better actors for voice over for the animals. If you wanna watch a funny Dolittle, watch Eddie Murphy's Doctor Dolittle, it's hilariously funny. Even the sequel is better than this trash they are trying to pass off as a movie."
113,"Dolittle, the story of a man who speaks to animals and the adventures that ensue. It's a pretty simple premise, one that's been done before for sure, but now it has Robert Downey Jr headlining it.As I was watching this, I kept having to remind myself that this is a kids movie. That's a bad thing in this case. This entire movie seems desperate to resort to the lowest grade of entertainment. I haven't seen so many butt and fart jokes in a long long time.Beyond that, Downey is really hamming this one up in a not super enjoyable way. I was hoping we'd get to see his Sherlock again but this is... Not that. It's not all him though, the animals look goofy here too. Cartoonish at best and never once realistic. The voices weren't bad, it just looked off the whole time.The one positive for me was Antonio Banderas. He's not around much but I found him captivating whenever he was on screen.Again, this is a kids movie and I am not a kid. I'm not the target audience here. Thing is, there have been a lot of kids movies in recent years that are enjoyable for kids and adults alike. The success of other films makes me less forgiving when it comes to this one, especially when there easily could be something better with this cast and concept.Unless your have kids, don't waste your money on this one. Wait for it to hit a streaming service or some network and even then there will likely be better options. If you have kids though and there's nothing else, it's an option."
114,Last episode of Game of Thrones was better than this. And that says something
115,"I just found the film a fun enjoyable, uplifting film to watch. Would love to have more adventures in this world. Yes it a kid film, yes it has a simple story, simple villains but the CGI I thought was good, an stylize to fit in with the rest of the universe with its bright vivid colours, they were never meant to be photo realistic.An at this rate it will probably be up against sonic the hedgehog for best film oscar. lol"
116,"Turned out to be a good, fun film. If you can't see it for what it is and enjoy it, then maybe it's time to relax and try to enjoy the silly things a little more.Oh, and RDJ's Welsh accent isn't bad at all! He obviously put effort in to not just get the accent pretty accurate but also perfected his 'Wenglish'."
117,"This film is bad it's not funny ,dialogue makes no sense ,the animals refer to 21st century jokes ...downy needs to go back to iron man .
Sounds terrible...
This film is a waste of money, time and cellluloid .Funny for kids under 9 ..."
118,"Oh lord of course it'sa great idea For a story, Eddie Murphy already proven that. LMAO. Make something NEW please!"
119,"Now I understand what Downey Jr meant when he was saying he wants to do other things, than Marvel movies. That's what he prefers to being Iron Man. Brilliant."
120,"Just saw this with a friend today, and I liked it. It won't be winning any awards anytime soon but it was definitely just a fun movie. Robert Downey Jr is always a pleasure, and the side characters were pleasant too. The animals were also pretty funny, but I think Yoshi the bear was my favorite (the gorilla was a close second).My favorite line was from Barry the Tiger when he gets kicked in the groin by the gorilla and says ""OOOOHHH BARRY'S BERRIES!!!!!"" Had myself rolling on the floor at that one. XDDon't go into this movie with high expectations. Just go in it for a fun ride and surely you will have a few laughs!"
121,"Dolittle aroused the most positive feelings - such an interesting fabulous adventure that completely takes in and allows you to forget about the real world. I thought I would not like it, but in the end 2 hours passed quickly, I was very surprised when the credits started. And the cast deserves the highest praise."
122,Really fun to watch movie. No stress just laughing. Me and my husband really enjoy it.
123,"Never have I walked out of a movie before until this movie. RDJ's accent is probably the worst thing in this movie; it was extremely inconsistent and because of that it was obviously a fake accent. There was a seemingly random romance about to blossom between two kids, like why was that necessary? The first 45 minutes of the movie just kept skipping scenes almost, a lot of things were horribly explained. Just....don't see this movie."
124,"Took the kids, they seemed to enjoy it which I guess is the point, but for me, it's a big no I'm afraid. Shallow, contrived and a missed opportunity to be a decent movie. Many of the CGI animals were simply annoying. A movie I will forget pretty quickly."
125,"Dolittle is simultaneously my favorite and least favorite film of 2020. Dolittle shows that having a talented cast but giving them nothing to work with can have disastrous effects. I think Robert Downey Jr. is a great actor but what was he thinking with this movie. In fact, what was any of the actors thinking when they signed on. Most of these actors are Oscar nominees or Oscar winners and they choose to do this. All of their performances are terrible especially Downey which really sucks. He has just a smidge of charm but it's overshadowed by his terrible accent and dialogue. He puts on this Welsh accent and you can hardly make out a word he is saying. The script only makes his awkward accent even worse. The dialogue is very unnatural and awkward and doesn't allow for jokes to be clever but instead forced. The humor for this film is awful. It all comes down to fart jokes and getting hit in the groin jokes. It's incredibly unfunny and really took me out of the film. What really made me change my score was a joke involving a Dragon and a release of gas. I completely gave up on the film at that point. All of the other characters present are dull and obnoxious. The characters don't get developed at all. They have one flaw/character trait that defines them. They have character arcs but they are all resolved in one or two scenes. The visual effects aren't terrible but they aren't that great. In some scenes, they look fine but in others they look pretty bad. The film is all around lifeless and boring. The only reason I can think of to Universal Pictures making this movie was to keep the license to the Dr. Dolittle property. I was bored out of my mind while watching this. The characters were unappealing so I wasn't interested when any of them appeared on screen. The only time I wasn't bored was the animation segment in the beginning of the film which looks nice but the voice over dialogue was terrible. At certain points in the film, a character will be saying something on screen but the dialogue would be completely different. It was incredibly obnoxious and distracting. Overall, Dolittle takes an impressive cast and completely wastes them on a soulless, boring, unfunny, and unappealing film."
126,What a disappointment nothing like the dr Dolittle I know and the story line doesn't make any sense and why did they change Robert Downey Jr voice.....
127,"Granted, I didn't have much of any expectations for the 2020 movie ""Dolittle"" as I sat down with the family to watch it.Sure, this movie is a family movie, entertaining and enjoyable for the youngsters. But for us adult, and anyone whom have a healthy interest in movies, then ""Dolittle"" was a mediocre, if not actually tame, experience at best.While ""Dolittle"" definitely is a visually nice movie to look at, then it was lacking and haltering abysmally in terms of a compelling storyline and characters with depths and personalities.There is nothing to put a finger on in terms of CGI presentation, because the animals and the dragon were fantastic to look at. They were very realistic and life-like, which definitely worked well in favor of the movie.But the movie had a massive shortcoming in terms of a mundane and downright mediocre script from writers Stephen Gaghan, Dan Gregor, Doug Mand, Chris McKay and Thomas Shepherd. Actually it is somewhat unfathomable that a storyline and script can become so dull and generic with 5 people writing.The movie does have some good acting and voice acting talents on the cast list. But given the fact that they were given next to nothing to work with in terms of script and characters served as an anchor around their legs, shunting them in their performances.I am rating ""Dolittle"" a very mediocre five out of ten stars. While it is watchable once, with the family, this is hardly a memorable or outstanding movie in any way. Nor is it a movie that I will ever return to watch a second time."
128,"I loved it!
It is an amazing movie with tons of funny gags and jokes; really great for all the family.Highly recommended"
129,"I don't understand the hate this movie gets. Its a film aimed at children and children tend to like this kind of movies its silly and funny and adventurous and new. I don't get it why people always get upset because a remake isn't like the original classic one, why it should be, who would like to watch a movie remade the same over and over again. And it seems all the bad rewiews are made by adults who try to rate childrens movie isn't that crazy."
130,"This movie is so great, my whole family enjoyed every second of this movie. It's so amazing"
131,"I'm old enough that Dr. Dolittle for me is Rex Harrison, rather than Eddie Murphy. But neither previous version of the character has much to do with this aimless mess, which seems wholly lacking in vision.Reclusive since the death of his wife, Dr Dolittle (Robert Downey Junior) is stirred from his exile when the Queen of England (Jessie Buckley) is poisoned. Identifying the poison, Dolittle and his menagerie sail off to recover the antidote but are pursued by Dr Blair Mudfly (Michael Sheen) who has his own nefarious plans.It's sometimes easier to identify a poor film if it has one overarching failure, terrible CGI or a really bad ending, or something like that . . but ""Dolittle"" isn't like that. There's not one major failing but rather more that everything is a bit subpar. It's like death by a thousand cuts. RDJ's accent isn't staggeringly terrible, but it's not really plausible either. The plots not awful, but it's very pedestrian. The CGI creatures look OK, but are nothing that you haven't seen before. Actually, having said that, one aspect that I really hated was the way the animals spoke. The film is clearly set in the time of Queen Victoria (she's literally a character in it) but the animals, particularly the pairing voiced by John Cena and Kumil Nanjiani, speak in modern idioms and slang. I will ringfence Craig Robinson's character, the squirrel Kevin away from any of the criticism here, as he was one of the few aspects of the film that made me regularly laugh.I don't understand ""Its' a kids film"" as if that's some sort of defence for not trying very hard. I appreciate that most of them don't, but that only makes something like ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"", ""The Lego Movie"" or virtually any Disney/Pixar film stand out more.It's fortunately relatively uncommon for a film's title to also be its ethos."
132,"When I say this is suitable for kids I mean little kids, not kids who have started becoming at all discriminating. From an adult point of view, this is just crap. What the heck actors like Jim Broadbent and Michael Sheen are doing in this is a mystery. And why is Dr Dolittle, surely one of the most English of literary characters, being played by a Yank? Actually, the aforementioned Mr Broadbent would have been a much better choice in the title role.Ultimately, it really doesn't matter because this is not really Dr Dolittle, at least not the Dr Dolittle created by Hugh Lofting and beloved of children for years. No, this is Hollywood's exploitation of the character with splashy special effects, lots of CGI, not much in the way of an intelligent plot, lame attempts at humour, some corny and unnecessary romance, and lots of attempts to inject maudlin emotion. It's pretty awful.Unless you're watching this with the kiddies, give it a miss. Even then, have a good book handy. In a word - yuk!"
133,"This film is a fun adventure story, with good acting and vibrant cgi. RDJ gives us light humour, while touching on themes of great loss. Don't listen to the critics, who seem to have caught the bug of being overly negative. Everyone enjoyed bagging Cats so much, that they didn't know when to stop. This film was made for enjoyment and doesn't take itself seriously, and deserves a more light hearted approach."
134,"I reviewers get upset when a kids movie is juvenile, why would you want an adult kids movie. I thought it was a great show for all ages, but especially for kids."
135,This is a great movie for the entire family. There is suspense and comedy. I think Robert Downey Jr. played the part of Dolittle beautifully and the voice actors were just as great! We loved it!
136,"This was amazing! Good story, good scenery , and a good laugh! Definitely going to watch this again!"
137,I wish I came here to read the reviews before taking miss 7 to see this. It was shocking. Its too Fast. Confusing. No real story. Downey jr is horrible in it. The kid isn't even needed despite being in heaps of scenes.I wouldn't even watch this again for free. Avoid.
138,"Very good family film, great special efects,i like a tot"
139,I found it enjoyable and it is fresh storytelling.
140,This is a great film for the family. Fun & something different
141,"I adore Robert Downey Jr as an actor and this movie didn't disappoint! Even as an adult I think it's an adorable, absolutely adorable movie. While RDJ certainly played a different character it was just too cute not to like the role and the characters involved. I really liked the movie and the uniqueness of it, definitely recommend it!"
142,"A movie nice to watch with your family and kids, story is great, the scenes are nice, and it is funny. I liked the movie and I think it got under rated I believe it deserves a higher rank."
143,"If you have heard bad things about ""Dolittle"", I have to tell you to watch it and judge for yourself. Growing up with the Rex Harrison version and reading books, I loved Dr. Dolittle's fanciful tales. Along came the Eddie Murphy version and they were funny, but didn't give me the same feel. Robert Downey, Jr. has captured the essence of Dr. Dolittle and brought back character to the original feel."
144,"Not sure if people understand what this movie is about, but one thing is for sure, they should be grateful.I've seen many reviews, many perspectives and many opinions and yes, we're different and we're treating it differently because we can't see what this movie was made for.A well made family movie that promises to teach and show your kids how to be good, do good and treat everybody with kindness in a cold sad world. Does your perspective or rating of this movie matter to you? Don't think so. Does it matter to your kids? Of course it does.Get your kids to see the movie and after, tell them that life is not easy, that they'll have ups and downs, they will fall but need to stand up again, and sometimes, people come and go, forever.In a difficult and sad world, stay safe."
145,"People are giving 3 stars saying robert DJ's accent changes a little in the movie. idiots. if bothers you so much for what ever idiotic reason to give this movie higher than average, its just your lack of sense of humour and not knowing the target audience. its a kids movie, i mean he talks to animals for pete's sake..."
146,"I have seen this movie and i can say that this version is better than versions starred by Eddie Murphy, i have no idea why the overall rating given by others for this movie is so low,but i think since the main target of this movie is for kids then i think this one is good enough even i admit that the special effect is not that impressive but the story line is simple and good for kids as it has some moral of the story that the kids can learn"
147,The film is well made but I can't get passed Robert Downey Jr 's accent. Why he could not speak normal is beyond me.
148,"Its a shame, i wanted critics to be wrong and for this to be better than expected but its actually a lot worse. My 10yr old hated it, my 17 year old thought it was rubbish and i just wanted it to end. It's a very poorly scripted movie with no real direction, no charm, very few jokes that work and Robert Downey Junior looks high most of the time. What's really odd though is the sound mix. It's obvious his lines were dubbed after but spacially it's really distracting like his words come from all around rather than his mouth. If you see it you'll hear what i mean. Real shame this movie as a few minutes in i knew it was going to be bad and i should have just got up and left. Makes me want to see the original Dr Dolittle with Rex Harrison. That was pretty bad but compared to this it was a masterpiece."
149,Was interesting to see RDJ in a role that's not Iron Man. Really nice adaptation of the original story. Much better than the Eddie Murphy movies.
150,"I was really looking forward to Doolittle until I heard the reviews. But then I remembered I loved a certain movie that recently came out that was also panned. So, critics be damned! This was a fun, and often funny movie with heart and I - and my adult friends who saw it with me - really enjoyed it. Robert Downey, Jr. will always be Iron Man to me, but he made a darn good Dr. Doolittle. Go and see it with an open mind and the heart of a child."
151,"Im not going to go into the synopsis as you can already read it. This is a childrens movie and not a heavy loaded or cerebral movie so if you wanna pass the time for some laughter and light headed fun, this is for you. Story telling do seems rushed and there are some slapstick comedy but the CGI is great and the animals are really well done. The voiceover are spot on and the acting is good. All in all i would say watch it for the fun of it and dont think too much about it.
Score - 7/10 because it is for children and most critics seem to have forgot that. Deduction is for rushed story telling."
152,"All the ingredients were there to make an enchanting childrens movie, great actors , humor, funny animals, fantastic cgi. However the story was weak, and not convincing. Therefore it belongs to category of movies that you will not remember for long. Average."
153,"Coming to the theater feeling worried due to bad reviews and waiting for scenes that thought causing the reviews and found none.Its a family entertaining movie, probably the bad reviews came from avengers fan who couldn't move away from tony stark death and expecting this as a replacement.Dont believe the reviews, just come and enjoy this wonderful film. Every character is great. Kids will love it for sure."
154,First review I wrote on IMDB and I just want to say I don't know why this is getting such tough reviews. Was it amazing? No. But my kids loved it and it was a very pleasant movie. Kudos to Robert Downey Jr. my 8 year old said it was the best animal movie he had ever seen!
155,"The beginning scene, film editing and CGIs - nicely done. All that were good. The story is simply OK. Robert Downey was good, the supporting characters were okay, at least.If you think you will watch it for only Downey, do it. He gives a solid performance and did a wonderful job. Although, I personally enjoyed movies like The Jungle Book and Maleficent movies more. I can't say that it really impressed me, it's just a mildly entertaining kids movie. I would give it a 6.5 out of 10.Oh and, white bear and gorilla were my favorite animals."
156,"I was thrown off by something I couldn't quite put my finger on watching this and I realized what it was...this is a kids movie, no I mean really its a kids film in the purest sense...
there is missing that trait thats common enough now as if its to be mandatory in kids films now that sly double edged adult humor gets injected for adults to enjoy...
and the film loses nothing for that because its truly an innocent hearted movie with out the sap or gosh darn it ickie-ness that you think that implies..
there are adult themes of loss and friendship and creating a family not of blood but of kindred spirits all wrapped up in a good old fashion adventure with dastardly villains but this film is very much made for children and how they view the world and I imagine those with kids with thoroughly enjoy the experience...
And hats off to Robert Downey Jr. who really reigns in his always there darker edge that accompanies his performances to produce a character study that both embraces his loss but plays to a child audience with out a hint of adult sensibility's
to clutter up the message or storyline...
Would I as an adult have enjoyed all those things I praise the film for deliberately leaving out the mix...yes as an adult I probably would have enjoyed it more but then that would change it from what it is..a kids movie the entire family can enjoy from youngest to those who think everything was better in their generation
The effects are phenomenal managing to both be as realistic as possible but giving each animal a character you can relate to like you would with animated characters that have those exaggerated features to help convey emotions but the film manages to tread that fine line between photo realism and cartoonish to great effect...
yep there are some gripes to be had notably about the editing and pace but they are just that gripes ...well done to everyone in producing a truely child like film for children and about as innocent at heart movie as I've seen in quite some time"
157,"Bad script, worse dialogue, editing looks like they didn't have enough footage to make a film so chopped up small pieces of film and tried to make a movie. The, actors looked bored and just said their lines, no chemistry between RDJ and any of the cast which is odd to say the least. In the end the movie couldn't decide what it wanted to be or what era they wanted to be in. Dialogue didn't match the era they seemed to be in at all. In the end you have to blame the director but the producer hired him and that was RDJ. I've never not loved an RDJ movie until now and I've seen them all. I guess it was bound to happen eventually."
158,"The list of names this movie has is absolutely incredible, with acting greats and comedy heavy hitters aplenty. It should have been a home run, but everything is just done so terribly wrong.There are too many cheap gags and half-hearted jokes forced on the actors in serious scenes while comedy greats like Kumail Nanjiani get saddled with quick one-liners every ten to fifteen minutes with little to no purpose and no build. Some are good, solid cracks that are just so jammed in and out of place that you barely have time to register them much less give a light chuckle. Add to that how each animal seems to get one singular joke they continuously repeat in new ways every time they get a moment, and this movie is more exhausting than funny.Don't get me wrong, the actors involved all do fine and did their jobs well, but the script is tired and the comedy is so underwhelming that it set them all up for failure from the start."
159,"Dolittle is pretty adventurous, fast paced, great voices, and beautiful! This has such a grand scale of big budgeted scenery and set design which is very nice. Some nice charm for sure, I like how the story plays out. I do prefer the humor, voices and story in Doctor Dolittle (1998) more!"
160,"I've never been all that fond of the way the character of Dr. Dolittle is handled on the big screen. It seems that most movies find it more interesting to have him already established as a professional who has perfected the art of talking with the animals and going on off-the-wall adventures to find mythological beasts. It makes for an odd story, and misses the most interesting part of the character. I would think it would be much more interesting to explore what it would be like in those early moments when you develop the skill of talking to animals. In this movie we have a washed up Dolittle who is wallowing in self-pity because he lost the woman he loves. This is decades after he started talking with animals and established his career. It's kind of depressing and pathetic, and doesn't make the protagonist all that likable. There is a young kid who goes along for the ride who is charming and adds a more positive feel to the film, but he simply can't save this goofy plot.The entire movie feels like it is heavily targeted at children, because the humor is adolescent and the bumbling around that all these animals do on their journey is the most amateur attempt to get laughs. They had a great voice cast playing all of these creatures, and yet they didn't write any good jokes for them. I want to enjoy the humor of their antics, particularly because I love some of the comedians, but the material is atrocious. The adventure is tedious and lacks any surprises, and Michael Sheen plays a villain that exaggerates his evil tendencies even more than when he played a vampire in Twilight. The biggest offense for me was that I found Dolittle so boring. Nowadays studios are better at making movies for the whole family that can entertain the parents too, but this one was a big misstep. I've seen worse trainwrecks (some of them that also star Robert Downey Jr.) but Dolittle is an unfortunate sign that nowadays RDJ doesn't know what to do when he's not in an Iron Man suit."
161,"I was postponing watching this movie because of the bad ratings.. and I am happy that I've finally watched it. I don't understand the bad rating to be honest. It's a nice, feel good family movie. The visuals are well done and the voiceovers were nicely done. Just watch the movie and then rate it yourself. It would be a shame not seeing Robert Downey Jr in this movie."
162,Ok this isn't the best film I've ever seen but it is funny and there were at least 4 times I laughed out loud - it was fun and charming. I just wanted a feel good movie. This worked to brighten our day.Yes I know Robert Downey Jr. welsh accent is a bit all over but he didn't do too badly and Michael Sheen was as fabulous as ever.Watch this if you just want entertaining I think even the toughest critic will laugh at least once.
163,Don't be fooled about the bad reviews. This is a family fun movie plain and simple. To the haters saying RDJ has a bad welsh accent: 80% of the people in the world are not English natives so..
164,"I'm not sure what people were expecting when they give this a low rating. It's a sweet story, well acted. What more do you want from a film about a human that talks to animals"
165,"I think this film got unwarranted hate from reviewers used to seeing the type of adult-pleasing films Pixar puts out (not that there's anything wrong with Pixar)
But I've just watched this flick with kids 10 and 11 and they were laughing and engaged the whole time. This is not a movie for grown ups. But it's sweet and lighthearted and I didn't have to explain any complicated plot-points or comfort crying youngsters. It is a charming but average film, but has some wonderful voice-talent and RDJ looks as if he had a blast making it. If you're looking for something your kids haven't already watched to entertain them for about an hour and a half - there's nothing wrong with this one."
166,"I'll be honest the trailer for this didn't look great, the only reason I wanted to watch it was because it had talking animals and I also felt that any film had to be better than Eddie Murphy's attempt at Dolittle from 22 years ago and nothing will match up with Rex Harrison's from 53 years ago, so I was intrigued to see where on the Dolittle Scale this ends up. Will it be more Rex than Eddie or more flop than form?Two things that surprised me to begin with. Firstly, I don't anyone expected Robert Downey Jr's accent, in fact I think that more people expect the Spanish Inquisition than a Welsh Iron Man! Weirdly it works, well it does after you get used to it. Secondly, I didn't expect it to be a family adventure film, the trailer didn't show it as such but it had some good action scenes and plenty for the kids) and immature adults - like me) to laugh at as well. Chases, fights, ship sinking, the obligatory end of level baddy and a race to save the Queen(obviously).Mr Downey Jr. is supported by legendary actors Michael Sheen, who lets his fun psychoness shine through and Jim Broadbent as well as a surprising appearance by Antonio Banderas, who happily chews up all the scenery around him and has great fun doing it!And then you have the voice actors, Emma Thompson, Rami Malek, John Cena, Octavia Spencer, Tom Holland, Selena Gomez, Kumail Nanjiani, Marion Cotillard and Ralph Fiennes, a more eclectic bunch you won't find but what a superb bunch of actors and actresses who each bring something special to their characters. Though Mr Cena as Yoshi the Polar Bear and Rami Malek as Chee-Chee a Gorilla shine out for me.I could nit-pick and point out they arrived at Blenheim Palace instead of Buckingham Palace in the film - as someone who is British and knows his London from his Cotswolds, they peeved me a little. Dolittle's general grumpy behaviour, especially to his apprentice Tommy (Harry Stubbins) goes on a bit too long, but then again Tommy did kind of force himself upon the situation, the equivalent would be a 14 Year Old sitting in my classroom and saying they are there on work experience whether I like it or not and when I try to move them along, the children in my class escape from school and go and grab him from the road and bring him back into school passed all the security and plonk him back in my classroom. I mean to be fair, that'd annoy the heck out of me as well.But forget about the misplaced palaces and the kid who wouldn't accept no and focus on the silly fun and interplay between the animals and if Carlsberg ever did baddies then Michael Sheen would pop right out of that can! And you have a fun Saturday afternoon film that kids will love and most adults will find inoffensive. A well-deserved 12/20 for some awesome actresses and actors and some amusing action/adventure set pieces."
167,"This film is a good kids outing and RDJ is energetic and entertaining, however as good as his Welsh accent is, it is hushed, rasping and mumbled for a high proportion of the film. I found it really irritating that I was straining to try and get what he was saying half the time which was nothing to do with his accent or acting credentials. Not sure why that was necessary as it really spoiled the character for me."
168,"As ever the film makers and all involved had good intentions here, so I don't wish to pick apart the film too much, but here's a few things...Pros:
Robert Downey Jnr's Welsh accent although a little jarring come from him, is pretty good. Kudos for the attempt and for the choice! Probably helped having Mr Sheen on set.Nice bright feel to the film. Perhaps a little saturated.Kids may well enjoy this more than adults. It's who it's aimed at after all.There are moments where the film has heart.Cons:
The use of CGI often felt heavy handed, simply because I could 'see it'. Too often the edits looked a bit 'off'. The creatures looked very good though.RDJ's voice never felt like it was coming from him. I know films use a lot of overdubbing, for many different reasons, but this felt like it was heavy for RDJ. Mix this with use of CGI, and the film feels very fake and unconvincing. (Story/Setting aspects aside of course ;)The narrative did not feel that there was much there. Again, fine for children perhaps, but not much for adults, or at least this adult."
169,"At first, I was a little bit worried about watching this movie. However, after that, I cannot understand all the bad critics.
In my opinion, this movie does its work: it is funny, entertaining and also has very nice special effects. Actors do a good job too.
It is not the best movie in the world, it might not be too deep about its meaning, but we all left the theater with a nice feeling. Also the rest of the audience seemed to have a nice time as well, specially children."
170,"Don't trust the low ratings! My kids loved the movie (so did the parents). As some people express, this is a perfect family move."
171,I rated Dolittle (2020) 8/10 #IMDb. I thoroughly enjoyed this farcical romp. Sure it is not like the original but that exists in it's own place and time to be cherished always. This is another telling and had me laughing out loud the entire film.
172,All the family enjoyed this film. Why it has so many poor I will never know.
173,Idk found it hard to watch idk why... we all liked it over all but a few things here a d there was annoying!
174,"For a new generation this is a family friendly movie for the most part.
There are some scary bits for really younger viewers.
Robert Downey Jr. was not right for this part at all. Nothing about his performance was believable for a second. The really bad accent gets distracting very quickly. Stick to Iron Man where all the money and no effort is required.
In fact I really couldn't see a decent performance from any of the human characters although it was nice to see Jim Broadbent again if even ever so fleetingly.
The voice acting was actually pretty solid and worked quite well with the CGI characters.
Overall as a movie though, it felt very rushed. Seems the producers were trying to cram just as much story in that would allow the viewer to string together the generous visuals and expensive CGI. Without Emma Thompson's narrative a new viewer to the story would be completely lost.
I wouldn't recommend it unless there were children of a certain age you needed to keep distracted for a while."
175,"Enjoyed this movie a lot, it is great for kids which I think a lot of people forget when they are reviewing this movie."
176,I don't know why Robert decided to make his voice super different and quiet that we could barely even hear him ... but it was annoying. Besides that it was a fun kid movie about family and friends and loyalty! I don't know what people were expecting but it was sweet and I loved all the animal personalities with famous celebs voices !
177,"I worry about people who can't just like movies without expecting ....the saying, ""everyone is a critic,"" is correct these days. We watched this as a family and loved it. It had a really interesting story that was different from all the Dolittles before. And it had an adventurous feeling like the book. My four year old watched this happily and understood what was going on. This was a visually stunning movie and the costumes and design of the animals are spot on, and so beautifully done. I really enjoyed RDJ...and Michael Sheen was so weirdly great. If you can't enjoy this...then I fear for you.
Go waste your brain cells on some of the Netflix fodder instead. SHEESH!"
178,Enjoyed this movie. Fun to watch Downey act in a different role. Wondering why Lady Rose didn't get any worthy credit and the queen did when she basically did nothing the whole movie. Fun moments.
179,Remember this is for kids and young at heart type of movie meaning do not expect a marvel or iron man type of action this is an adventure movie and entertain kids. Kids doesnt like too much action or eye sore fx and explosions these are for kids and good pop corn movies with kids. If you critique this movie for its arts go watvh other movies
180,"This is a good family adventure, with a couple of small scenes that can be classed as intense, but it is rated PG. Overall the movie runs smoothly and is well acted. Judging by the end clip half way through the end credits, I am thinking that a sequel is on its way. Let's hope that it is done as good as this was."
181,"It was different than the original and different than the one with Eddie Murphy . Good movie , perfect to watch with family . Entertaining for kids and adults"
182,Somebody should have stood up to Robert Downey Jr and told him to knock it off. His weird murmured English accent was out of place and out of character. The story is good. The CG is good. The characters are good. The scenes were bright and colorful. The movie didn't need an overtop top actor trying to prove he has more range then Ironman. It felt like Robert Downey Jr. was pretending to be Johnny Depp as he thought Johnny Depp would have played Dolittle. The story didn't need it.
183,"I expected this movie to be a cute movie targeted at little children. But came away liking it more than I thought, and I'm in my 40s.It is a cute movie without being too cutesy that normal adults will find it annoying. But it is family friendly enough that the little ones will love it. In fact the little ones will find this an adventure story.After the movie, I realised I watched this entire movie without feeling that parts of it were too slow or boring for me. Normally on movies, where there are boring or slow parts, I get up and do something during that period. But not in this movie. In this movie, I happily sat continuously through the entire movie, from beginning to end.This is an adventure movie the entire family can enjoy."
184,A lot of people grumbled about this film but they seem to miss the point. It's a kids movie. If you need more than a 10-pack of candles on your birthday cake this movie isn't meant for you. Still it's a fine kids movie with an impressive voice cast and excellent creature animation.
185,"A masterpiece can be moving, or making a bold daring point, with meticulous cinematography and witty writing, but it is the films that are not the masterpieces that are truly fun, and Dolittle is one of them."
186,The Movie idea was fantastic like the way Robert interact with animals is just amazing . It had many scenes which would make you laugh so badly. Dialogues are super . The only thing i somehow didn't like was the ending part .It could be more interesting but i should say Overall this Movie was Epic .I really loved it
187,To watch with family and kids. Good special effects too
188,"I cant believe when i saw 5 star rating for this movie,
but i always say Robert downi Jr's movie cant be that bad,
so it was,
it feels like too short but at the end it was a one of a kind movie !"
189,Great entertainment and adventure filled movie. But some critics expected a little too much in this movies just because RDJ is in the movie. This creat a chance to DC fans to troll and criticise the movie. Feel free to watch this. Believe me its not disappointing.
190,"There's a lot of big name voices in Dolittle,Here's the revelation of the new year: I didn't hate Dolittle. In fact, I kind of admire it and mostly enjoyed it. Given the advertising, bad buzz
It's a good movie to watch with your family. It's not going to win an Oscar or by all means any award; But it's a heartfelt and funny movie."
191,RDJ plays an eccentric animal Doctor who learns to let people in to his heart again. Considering its a family film we were laughing in our seats throughout! Lots of little jokes and puns made this movie much better than I was anticipating.
192,"This is a very nice, kind, witty, and entertaining movie.
Highly recommended for kids and families and everyone who had not forsaken their inner child.
The only downside to this movie is Robert Downey Jr.
After all these years, I still can't understand how this guy has managed to trick everyone into thinking he is an actor. He is always terrible, and terribly full of himself. A clear sign of his inability as a thespian is the simple fact that he couldn't fake an accent if his life depended upon it. He is always terrible. I found myself mentally tuning-out his lines every time his character opened his mouth.
And to cast him alongside real actors like Michael Sheen or Banderas only makes his inability all the more evident. But it really becomes embarrassing when you realize that even the CG parrot is a better actor."
193,"The film is for young children, so you have to make allowances for it. The film may be silly, and there is a scene that is rather gross. In addition, Robert Downey Jr will always be Iron Man, so I just can't get my head around him being another character."
194,"$165 million worldwide against a production budget of $175 million. Yep, that's a box office failure.Yet the 1967 film that preceded this one is also one of the biggest failures in movie history. It tripled its original budget, ballooning to $17 million ($132 million in today's money). And the movie only made back $9 million. Despite the negative reaction to that movie, 20th Century Fix lobbied for the film at the Academy Awards, where it was nominated for Best Picture and won for Best Original Song and Best Visual Effects. They went so far as to offer sixteen consecutive nights of free screenings of the film at the studio lot, along with dinner and champagne, to Academy members.That movie was a complete mess to make, as star Rex Harrison disliked co-star Anthony Newley. According to Mark Harris' Pictures at A Revolution: Five Movies and the Birth of a New Hollywood, Harrison decided to vent his jealousy of Newley by using anti-Semitic slurs in the actor's direction. At one point - due to this and his insistence on singing live versus lip synching - Harrison was fired and replaced by Christopher Plummer. Then, Harrison came back and Plummer still needed to be paid. To top that off, Geoffrey Holder, who played William Shakespeare the Tenth, the leader of Sea Star Island, was subjected to racial namecalling by members of Harrison's entourage.Does it get worse? The animals often bit and crapped all over cast members. And some of the ducks literally forgot how to swim and almost drowned. Then, as they were shooting the giant pink sea snail at Marigot Bay, Saint Lucia, the natives - angered by a stomach bug caused by snails that had sickened the island's children earlier that year - began to stone the giant snail. Around that time, producer Arthur P. Jacobs has a heart attack.Finally, when they got back to California, Harrison insisted on re-recording all of his songs live on set. This would later cause even more headaches, as the orchestra would have to record the songs again later to match his speed.So when you look at all of those issues - Eddie Murphy's Doolittle remake earned around $300 million on a $70 million dollar budget and spawned two canon sequels and two spin-offs, so it doesn't count in this discussion - you may realize that this movie isn't anywhere near the bomb that the original film was.This movie has all the hallmarks of a bomb. And if you've learned anything during this week of box office failures, you know that movies show the signs of bombdom long before they play the silver screen.Here's a good one: three weeks of reshoots, along with Syriana director Stephen Gaghan needing a second director's help (Jonathan Liebesman, whose record of Battle: Los Angeles, Wrath of the Titans, 2014's Worst Director Razzie-winning Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles suggests that maybe, just maybe, a better third director may have been needed) and writer Chris McKay (the LEGO movies) writing new comedic scenes, as most of the humor was falling flat. There was also the hope that Seth Rogen and Brendan O'Brien would pitch in, but they couldn't commit to the film. Oh yeah - The Lego Batman Movie writer John Whittington tried to write some new scenes, but his work was shredded by star Robert Downey Jr.As for Downey Jr., he based his lead role on Welsh neo-pagan physician William Price. One of the reasons? He didn't want to do another British accent. Yes, the pioneer of cremation in the UK was the inspiration for the lead character in a children's movie. Cool story.The biggest sign that this was a lit fuse waiting to die in theaters? It kept getting moved. First, it was moved so that it wouldn't compete with the latest Star Wars film (which also got moved and is a failure story in and out of itself), then it was placed in theaters in January, traditionally the graveyard for movies that studios want to wipe off their shoes.So how is it?Well, I didn't hate it. That's a victory.A lot of the credit for that goes to the great voice talent. This may be the only movie credit that Emma Thompson and Ralph Fiennes share with John Cena and Jason Mantzoukas, but such is life.But I never understand movies where we're supposed to fall in love with a hero who wants nothing to do with being a hero. It's like the lead has already made some progress through the hero's journey, yet we've missed all the good moments and start off in the dreaded third act. I remember as a child, watching Popeye in a theater, and wondering why Robin Williams' version of the role hated spinach and didn't want anything to do with saving the day. I kind of felt the same way here, but it comes together.It's odd to see Ralph Ineson in a kid-friendly movie after I associate his voice with The VVitch so much, but again, life's weird. And it's always nice to see Antonio Banderas in a movie, even if it's a minor role. That said - Nicholas Cage was supposed to play that part and I would have lost my mind of he showed up in this movie.This isn't the kind of movie that's going to change your life. But shouldn't some movies just be trifles? Silly bits of fun? Maybe they don't need to cost this much and demand this much work, but that's what box office failure week is all about."
195,"I've always been a big fan of the original movie starring Rex Harrison so the trailers for this feature caught my attention.In answer to all the critics, yes, the plot and script for this are rather simplistic and Robert Downey's attempt at an English accent is just ... awkward (but we knew that already from his attempts at Sherlock Holmes). However, this is a kid's movie -- the performances are delightful for the target audience and even enjoyable as an adult. Robert Downey did a great job accentuating the doctor's eccentricities, Michael Sheen's villainy reminded me of Saturday morning cartoons when I was a kid, and Antonio Banderas was superb as the pirate captain.The CGI animals are a definite upgrade from the costumes and puppets used in the Rex Harrison film and I really enjoyed how they portrayed Stubbins in this film. Emma Thompson's Polly is probably the star of the animals but Barry the tiger, Chee-Chee the gorilla, and Jip the dog were also wonderful.Disregard the haters, this is an enjoyable (for all ages!) break from the agenda-driven movies so prevalent today. Then, if you have never seen the Rex Harrison movie, do yourself a favor and rent that one ..."
196,"Not nearly as bad as you may have heard. Sure, it's a complete re-telling of the good ol' stories by Hugh Lofting, but it's pretty charming and the atmosphere here is way closer to the originals that in the movies we had for quite some time since the very first adaptation. Even though yes, Tony Stark isn't really what you have in mind when you think about short and fat Dolittle from Hugh Lofting's works.Surprisingly, Robert Downey Jr. fits pretty well in this version and it's... kind of hard not to like the story's new look. Especially since it feels pretty romantic in the old school way. Dolittle isn't the movie that tries to tell you about what's right in our modern society. It's the most basic story about the most basic feelings. About love, friendship and other things that people nowadays often forget while chasing their dreams of the perfect society. And I must say, it totally works. At least because we don't have much of such basic, but cute stories nowadays. Dolittle is the kind of the movie you'll probably want to watch with your family and you'll probably end up hugging them at the end. Just because.The problem with this movie is... the jokes suck. Hard. Really, really hard... And there's quite a lot of them too. No, seriously, almost every single scene here is ruined by a cheap joke. I mean... what was the point in creating all that charm and romance when you were going to ruin all that by tons of cheap laughs? I mean, yes, there's always a place for some humor in Dr. Dolittle, but the jokes here are so cheap and cheesy that they just end up feeling out of place. In the same way those stupid jokes felt in The Last Jedi. Those are just... wrong for the movie. It's not even about what kind of humor you prefer. It's about the fact that this exact kind of humor doesn't fit this exact movie.So, even though there's a lot of good in this movie and I must say that I've totally missed the old school adventures full of charm and romance, this movie doesn't feel nearly as good as it was supposed to. Like I've said, it's not nearly as bad as you may have heard, but it's just way too... messy. Like nobody even tried to proofread the script, which was written in only a couple of hours. As the result, even though you won't suffer much while watching this flick, you'll probably won't want to see it again. Like... ever. Which is sad, since, like I've said, I totally missed this kind of adventures and I really liked Robert Downey Jr. here. Won't even mind to see more movies with him as Dr. Dolittle. But oh, well..."
197,"I know this follows closer to the book, but for me eddie murphys do little is so much better in every way and even looks better considering how much older itis."
198,"Loved it except for RDJ's terrible accent that kept changing! CGI was brilliant, amazing animals 😉"
199,"I gave 5 stars because of the talking animals. Talking animals are almost always funny and in this movie it's not different. The talking animals are funny, mostly, but that's it. This isnt a good movie, but that's just my opinion."
200,"After years of doing super hero films, this is Robert Downey Jr.'s palate cleanser. While it's a much better version of Dolittle than the two previous films starring Eddie Murphy, this film was still a little underwhelming. The visuals and setting were fantastic but the story was very weak and the abrupt ending was quite simply boring. It built itself up for a grand adventure but unfortunately the adventure fizzled out much too quickly. The payoff wasn't really worth the time put into watching the film. It could have been fantastic had it spent more time in development. Overall, it was an OK film."
201,"A movie to watch and forget afterwards. Yes, the animation is way better than the original version, but who wonders. Besides that it is just shallow entertainment, so are the jokes."
202,"I don't know if it's just me but I got the impression that Robert Downey jr voice was dubbed. Not saying it wasn't him but maybe he rerecorded his lines changing his voice or something which was then dubbed over.
It also gave me the impression it was a much longer film badly hacked down to just the highlights
I'm sure little children will enjoy it and maybe it was more focused at them but for an adult who's still a big kid at heart I was disappointed"
203,"I wanted to have high expectations for this film because i enjoyed the past Dr.Dolittle films (played by Eddie Murphy) and it was just all over the place like what even was that Scottish/south African accent from Downey.Jr the only thing i enjoyed was the live action anmials voiced by some decent actors other than that couldnt watch the last 20 minutes of the film.
Maybe give it a try when it comes on sky demand or Netflix not worth the cinema experience"
204,"I enjoyed the movie the cast of characters are funny, it is a family film so dont expect a lot of action!!!"
205,"Dolittle is a fantasy adventure film based on the Doctor Dolittle stories by Hugh Lofting. Starring Robert Downey Jr in the title role, it is quite possibly the most embarrassing thing that this otherwise talented actor has associated himself with since his infamous drug benders of the late 90s and early 2000s.In early Victorian England, Doctor John Dolittle (Robert Downey Jr), an eccentric veterinarian with an uncanny ability to talk with animals, lives as a recluse inside his large mansion after his wife is lost at sea, only tending to other animals and refusing contact with the outside world. One day, Dolittle is summoned to Buckingham Palace for his assistance after the Queen is found to be dying of a serious illness. Initially refusing, Dolittle is persuaded by his macaw Poly (voiced by Emma Thompson) to reconnect with other people and he later decides to head over there with his animal entourage. Upon arrival, Dolittle deduces that the Queen has ingested a deadly poison that can only be cured by the fruit of the Eden Tree, which grows exclusively on a faraway island. Dolittle then sets off on a journey with his new young apprentice Tommy (Harry Collett) and his animals in the hope of locating this mysterious fruit before the Queen's life is claimed by her sickness.Despite the large amount of talent involved, Dolittle fails in almost every way possible at being an entertaining film for all ages, let alone as a worthy adaptation of a classic series of stories. The poorly paced, unfunny screenplay has the film moving with such a lack of care that it feels as though they were making it up as they went along. Characters felt underdeveloped and most gags were just annoying animal puns and/or fart jokes. I am fully aware that this film is intended for children but I'm sick and tired of people using that as an excuse to defend this lazy approach to filmmaking as a reason the audience should let it slide. There are plenty of films out there that are able to provide enough entertainment for children and adults alike without going down this easy route, even the 1998 Dr. Dolittle film starring Eddie Murphy, while not great by any means, had a better balance of entertainment value for everyone than this. I think I smiled once the entire film, and that was a scene involving a fly being freed from a flyswatter. When a fly made me feel more emotion than anything else happening in a film, that's where I realised there's a major problem.The effects used on the animals are a mixed bag overall. Every now and then an animal looked reasonably well integrated into the real world environments while others were clearly CGI added in post-production. This film had a reported budget of $175 million, which is about the same as 2016's The Jungle Book, a film with more realistic looking CGI animals, so it comes as a surprise that the effects here felt so lacklustre in comparison. Personally, I would have much preferred the film's budget went towards hiring better screenwriters to touch up its terrible script as I can usually forgive mediocre CGI so long as the story is well-written, which this certainly isn't. According to further research, this film had three weeks of reshoots after poor test screenings so it wasn't as though the filmmakers were pressed for time when fixing things up, yet the final result is still as weak as ever.As much as love Robert Downey Jr, it pains me to say that not even he could make this film watchable. He overacts in every scene he is in, not even in a so-bad-it's-good kind of way but one that makes the viewer pity him. Additionally, his attempt at a Welsh accent for his character was about as convincing as his Australian accent in Natural Born Killers and Tropic Thunder, laughably inconsistent and easy to distinguish as fake to native speakers. I hope this film is but a mere hiccup in his post-Marvel Cinematic Universe roles as an actor as brilliant as him deserves much better. None of the voice cast for the animals were particularly memorable either, as their only contribution to the story was that they were simply talking animals voiced by celebrities helping the title character and the novelty of them being voiced by famous actors wore off very quickly. It got to the point where I felt like playing celebrity voice bingo when their names came up in the end credits. Tom Holland? Check. John Cena? Check. Emma Thompson? Check. Rami Malek? Check. Selena Gomez? Bingo!In conclusion, as bad as the film was, I can at least say it is very easy to forget about shortly after you have seen it. Also, due to it underperforming at the box office (Universal Pictures have reportedly lost over $100 million as a result), it is unlikely that a sequel will ever be made. This whole experience was merely a waste of time for everyone involved, nothing more, nothing less.I rate it 3/10"
206,There is enough humor to keep the older kids and adults entertained and a poignant story showcasing that family is about love for one another. There are solid family values throughout the film and the animals are fun and engaging. Wholeheartedly recommend for a great family movie!
207,"A clever blend of steam punk contraptions, nonstop pithy humor, and imaginative creativity...I suppose you could review this negatively if you do not like the actor and director's politics, as Robert Downey Jr is conservative and gets a lot of flack for it.If you can look past politics, you will enjoy the movie immensely IMO!We certainly did!"
208,IT was a amazing movie... I love it so much and will go see it again
209,This movie was just terrible! There were a couple of funny scenes. I will say that if you are taking kids there isn't any language so that was the one pleasant thing about it. For Harry Potter fans you will recognize Jim Broadbent who was Professor Slughorn in the 6th movie as well as the voices of Emma Thompson and Ralph Fiennes also from HP.
210,Not exactly a glorious follow up to playing Iron man for 11 years. Think Robert Downey Jr would have had better luck seeing if Jude Law and Guy Richie were available to do another Sherlock Holmes. Not the most horrible movie I ever seen but the mAgic is not there. Very unimpressed with the semi-animated film. It felt like Downey jr. was all by himself in the picture and that's never good. Dolittle goes nowhere and I really don't want to go there with it. Maybe they should have asked Eddie Murphy to come back with this.
211,The whole movie is pathetic and unenjoyable. Not worthy of RDJ.
212,"I rarely ever write reviews, but this movie was just bad. The humor and jokes were so forced and unfunny that even my 7 year old did not laugh. Simple cash in on a great actor who for what it is worth as checked out as he may have seemed during the film, was it's highlight.The animals and their banter with one another is just 'cringe' as our child put it. Terrible plot and writing, could not be forced to watch again, and we are fans of this genre."
213,"Watched this last night with my wife and daughter, other than the somewhat dubious welsh accent, it was a fun movie from start to finnish with plenty of LOL moments! Will definitely watch it again with extended family when we can!"
214,"The bad reviews on this are total bull. Overall an excellent film, well written and good performance. Good voice acting, great CGI and some of the usual cheese that we should expect when watching a feel-good film of this nature.There are many reviews stating that the plot only delivers what you would expect, but such is the nature of this kind of film. The story is a ""heroes journey"" adventure, where the heroes get called upon to complete the quest, and then they do so as is expected. There is a difference between a plot having predictability because of bad writing, and being predictable due to the genre. Dolittle is definitely the latter of these and merely does as many other films have done in the past.I definitely recommend this film if you like this kind of adventure, like animal movies or even just want a good, heart warming movie. 10/10 will watch again."
215,"First minute:Women Are Strong!Dolittle travels with a strong empowered woman (who agrees to marry him) as they discover... Blah! Blah!Anyway, She leaves Dolittle at home to bravely (because women are brave & strong) go off on a expedition of discovery & is sadly lost at sea.Next line:""At a time when animals were only considered as food, possessions & sport...""What? You know what else went on at this time or rather didn't; married women going off on their own to lead voyages of discovery.Barring the non-consequential & clumsy blatant political message in the first minute; this film was poor & inaccessible:Out of place accents, ham acting & an overall gobbledegook storyline."
216,"I love Robert Downey Jr... BUT... the dubbed over voice!!???? Why?? This film would have been much more enjoyable had he just used his own accent. I know he wanted to base his character on this Welsh guy but it completely ruined the film for me.
The actual voice was dubbed. Again, why??? I noticed it in the first moment he spoke and it bugged me the whole way through the film.
A (kind of) welsh whispering accent that just dominated the whole movie. Maybe some people ignore these things better, but for me, no.
I really love him as an actor and feel bad that he's going to get so much criticism for this but it is justified - sorry!
We took our 4 children. The 10 and 8 year old girls loved it. The 5 year old boy and 3 year old girl got bored after twenty minutes.
Sorry Robert, your own accent would have been great."
217,"""Dolittle"" suffers from a lack of imagination and relies way too much on CGI rather than giving viewers the reboot it deserves.
.
In this family film, a doctor who can talk to animals is asked to obtain medicine from a healing tree in order to save the Queen of England.
.
The fact that ""Dolittle"" was directed by Stephen Gaghan; the same person who wrote the Oscar-winning ""Traffic"" and ""Syriana"" is beyond me. The plot is so thin, the jokes are so stale and the CGI is way too much. Animatronics would've worked out so much better. The animals look bad and some of the voice cast doesn't match up. I love Robert Downey Jr, but this was not the role for him and I'm also throwing in that it was very difficult to understand his accent. ""Dolittle"" is a mess and should be forgotten about the moment you leave the cinema. Here's to another January disaster film."
218,"I loved it. It's not a masterpiece no, but I really loved it. Imma watch it back on a bad day to cheer me up."
219,Are you guys srs trashing this already it was a Movie that's all it was not every movie will be fucking amazing
220,Doolittle's inconsistent Welsh accent is unnecessary and distracting. If that weren't enough it sure sounds like it's dubbed in every scene.The plot is absurd.
221,"This is a really weird movie, stupid funny parts and RDJ makes no sense why he did this movie. I'm guessing it was just for fun because this isn't his usual talent. The dragon part is one of the most disturbing thing I've ever seen"
222,"I wasn't expecting much from this. I also wasn't expecting it to be this bad.The voices don't sync up, the CGI is god awful and the story is crap.A few funny little jokes but all round rubbish."
223,"I didn't think that Downey did the accent well to be honest. It was a bit messy.
Cute movie but not great.
And Definitely not downey's best work."
224,A great family movie with great acting and story line
225,I believe that junior has no talent.I only saw it but I only laughed twice.Talking animals and a doctor don't always make a funny film.Instead I prefer the Murphy's version.
226,"Not a movie I enjoyed one bit but sat through it cuz of the kids, they really enjoyed it."
227,"Such a good movie, awake of the kindness of human, and yes, I believe animals do talk and they have their own mind. with kind and warm mind, for kids it teach them how to appreciate animals and natural without showing too much violence. I don't understand ppl standing in an adult vision to judge this film, I hope you all can keep your innocent and appreciate people whose making this kinda film for your kids to grow up with warm heart not with violent, swearing and sexual relevant movies. these kinda film should be encourage more, not too silly but easy to understand with sweet naive meaning in it."
228,"This is a fabulous family film. No alcohol, drugs, murder,violence. Just family fun. Uplifting loveliness. Of course Robert Downey Jr is amazing. His Welsh accent was incredible. Why can't people enjoy movies that are just fun any more? It's fun fun fun. Wish they'd make a follow up"
229,"An absurd and badly constructed and directed pile of animal poop.RDJ mumbles his way across the British Isles desperately searching for his character's accent. He finally opts for a strange hybrid of Welsh, Scots and Indian with a generous helping of Irish thrown in for good measure.
The unfortunate things for us adults watching the CGI and special effects laden films of today, is that it's almost impossible to be surprised by anything.When everything is ""awesome"" nothing is awesome. The only person in my large troupe of children was my 5yr old - but even he lost interest - and none of my kids could explain how the voyage to the mysterious island was fraught with danger and adventure, but the journey back home to England was completely non existent.There was no magic in Dolittle. They should have considered making the animals incomprehensible to all but he, throughout the entire film - otherwise there is absolutely nothing remarkable to us about him, if we too share at least half his gifting, in understanding the speech of the animals!A bad telling of a should be classic."
230,"If you want a carefree movie and laugh throughout the entire thing, this is it! Adorable, laughable, admirable good characters, nice family fun loving movie with good characters! This was a perfect movie to make a bad night so much better! Great laughs and adorable throughout!"
231,"We only went to see this as there was nothing else we fancied as a family but wanted a trip to the cinema, this is the best film I've seen in ages! Really good fun for all the family! Robert Downey jnr never disappoints, I liked the story line and the characters were brilliant, would highly recommend!"
232,It is a humorous movie that works for the whole family
233,"It's a good, wholesome adventure movie. Beautifully filmed, but I could have done without Downeys accent."
234,Downey is at home in this character. The apprentice and Princess was highlights as well. My Grandson and I will remember seeing this together forever.
235,"Currently on 5.6 ave rating is way to harsh and unrealistic for this movie.
6yr old daughter loved it and I actually didn't sit in the cinema wanting it to finish. Some good jokes..good cast and overall enjoyable.
Ignore the bad reviews"
236,I don't usually review but was shocked to see how poor the reviews were after seeing it. The audience I saw it with were laughing and clapping throughout. It's a fun film not a cinematic masterpiece. It was meant to entertain and it did.
237,"I don't think mr. Iron Man should be here. I know he is great actor, but this film absolutely not his character and he should contribute more to action genre film.
Btw, the movie is good, make me laugh. Still would recommend it."
238,"My only issue with the film is the disconnect between the time period and the comedic stylings of some of the voice over characters. It was entertaining and amusing, but it did seem out of place with the overall heart of the film.That being said, the voice over actors did bring their comedic stylings in and did bring some hilarious moments in the film.Though these comedians did seem to distract from the overall tone of the film, it did in no way underscore Robert Downey Jr.'s performance. For anyone thinking they would only see Tony Stark, he does an amazing job distancing himself from that role.The animation could have been better, but the animals in the film were very hilarious and had the whole theater laughing. It was impressive that in its second week it still managed to pull in a large crowd.The biggest note of this film is its heart. I believe the overtone of the whole film is overcoming: overcoming fear, overcoming rejection, overcoming hate, and overcoming heartache.I believed this probably had one of the better moral messages than I'd seen in a long time. Aside from the potty humor and some adult jokes, this film is a great family movie and I am glad my son and I got to enjoy it."
239,"Real laughs and a feel good film make for a lovely break from our bleak world. I particularly enjoyed the script which appeals to both children and adults. As usual, Downey does a great job ... as do the other actors.. both live and as the voices of the animals. Recommended."
240,"I found beautiful quote from this movie :
""By helping the others, it will help yourself"" 😊"
241,People are seriously overanalysing this movie. It is a light and fun kids movie with lots going on. I'm sure no one is trying to win best actor or best picture with this. It's simply entertaining. This movie kept the attention of a birthday party for 3/4 year olds! I thought it was cute and wouldn't mind watching it over and over with my own 6 year old.
242,"I don't understand the negative reviews. This movie is fast paced, interesting and just down right fun! Dr. Dolittle must find a particular tree and use its fruit to save the young queen. He and Stubbins, his young apprentice/assistant, and his various animal friends embark on a marvelous quest. Unfortunately, they are followed by a villian, a doctor who went to medical school with Dolittle but who isn't nearly as talented as a doctor. The villian envys Dolittle's ability to speak with animals. The voices of the animals are amazing (watch the clever way they do the end credits). I highly recommend this movie and plan to see it again."
243,Totally a kids movies.... Lots of talking animals. The story is just okay. Nothing really special.
244,"We went because we love Robert Downey Jr. and we're surprised but how funny and surprising some scenes were. Really great overall. Funny, endearing, and just the right amount of whimsy. Downey doing what he does best - quirky character who secretly love his ""family""."
245,Fun movie. Not sure why rated poorly. I would recommend it.
246,A beautiful roll played RDJ.After Iron man he has much fan....I also like him. The movie has to much fun.
247,"This is a great movie for familyt. Use your imagination, have fun, and enjoy the movie. And remember, this is not iron man, this is dr. Dolittle... use your imaginationnnnnn.."
248,"Lots of negativity in some of these reviews. All I will say is that everyone in the theatre were laughing out loud, kids and adults. Never forget that the true worth of a movie is its ability to entertain."
249,I am not getting all the hate for this movie. This is meant to be a good family movie. And I can say that it definitely is. My family really enjoyed it. We all left the theater with smiles on our faces.
250,"Noticed that the positive reviews were from people who watched it with kids. which means it's a good kids' film!the voice of Dr Dolittle was strange, but other then that, it's a film parents and kids can watch together.watch it with a kid's heart and I think adults will and can enjoy it."
251,It was a fun feel good family movie with a great message. I don't know why people are hating.
252,"I'm a little surprised to see that, as of now (a week after it was released), the rating is only 5.6. I would like to think that over time it'll drift up over 6 where it belongs. Maybe it's just some early expectations not met?I saw this in the theater with my 11 and 14 year olds and we were all delighted. That's the word for it - delight. I didn't notice Downey's accent issues other are reporting. I was more taken in by his charisma and ability to keep the film entertaining and fun.The supplemental characters are also well struck, the visuals are good and the editing all works nicely. I just watched, or tried to watch, another film that I was expecting all this from - ""The Sorceror's Apprentice"" - where it should have worked (especially with low expectations) but didn't. In that film it starts out with terrible editing and really struck me as a TV show (and not a particularly one), and I (and my kids) couldn't get past the first 20 minutes or so. We actually just switched off to a TV show.Perhaps unsung here are Banderas as well as the whole scene he is in which really delivers a lot of old-school sense of adventure (like Sinbad). In addition, I don't want to do spoilers, but I'll just say my kids really liked the creature that comes up later in the show and its whole scene!This flick is certainly no Jumanji but a fabulous one to take the family to in the middle of winter and enjoy on the big screen."
253,"I loved this movie. It was full of silly moments that had me laughing the whole movie. It could have used a little tighter editing, but overall was enjoyable."
254,"I don't know why so many people are trashing this movie. It's not trying to be any more than it is, a fun kid-friendly movie that adults can appreciate, too. I laughed out loud more than once, and Robert Downey Jr. is always enjoyable. My one complaint is that there should have been more of Barry the tiger."
255,"Took my wife and kids to see this movie and it turned out to be better than many appear to claim.I would say the reason some don't appear to like it is because its more so geared towards the younger than your average family movie in the aspect of jokes and such.It is sort of like a more kid friendly Pirates of Caribbean. Less action, some jokes more for the younger.Most those complaining about Robert Downey Jr's acting are over exaggerating. Like often seen in movie reviews those complaining over exaggerate how things are.Basically, his acting was fine, but his British voice was a bit off.. Hard to understand what he was saying sometimes maybe too much bass or not enough clarity in his voice. Not sure what it was.His acting gets better farther into the movie.. The first scene is likely what throws most people off as it shows him talking in ""animal"" language and looks weird.. It looks weird in a way you can not relate with it, but its like literally a couple minutes and then its over..So if they had maybe cleaned up the first scene and improved his voice in the first 30 minutes of the movie probably the movie would have higher ratings..The critics like usual are completely out of touch with reality. I am guessing they simply don't like Robert Downey Jr and this is their opportunity to pounce."
256,"Family-friendly and fun for all ages.
The wonder, charm, adventure, and magic of Disney are alive and well in this fun, family-friendly flick!Films that hit theaters in January are traditionally horrible, but this new Dr. Doolittle movie has a lot of good going for it. There were tons of reshoots after the movie passed through various hands, but it flows fairly well. Directed by Stephen Gaghan, this is the first Dr. Doolittle film not to be produced by 20th Century Fox.I loved the introductory scene in animation style that looked like clips from an old Disney movie.
The incredibly talented cast includes 5 Oscar winners: Rami Malek, Jim Broadbent, Emma Thompson, Octavia Spencer, and Mario Cotillard. It also includes 3 Oscar nominees: Robert Downey Jr., Ralph Fiennes, and Kumail Nanjiani.
Emma Thompson's awesome voice is perfect as an actress or narrator in any Disney movie.
We had to say goodbye to Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, but now he brings another entertaining character to life. His accent is super strange though, and sometimes it's hard to understand what he says. It was distracting every time he spoke.
I recognized Antonio Banderas' voice before I recognized his physical appearance.
Gorgeous set pieces, landscapes, and scenery.
Some really great special effects.
The trailers did a good job of not revealing everything.
It's very different from the Eddie Murphy and Rex Harrison versions of Dr. Dolittle, but a fun addition to the story.
I liked the element of language. Dr. Doolittle has a natural gift to understand the languages of animals, but his young apprentice learns by studying. In other words, gifts and work are both valuable, especially when they are used together.Some moments definitely look like they're CGI.
The true adventure didn't really start until halfway through the film.
Not all of the humor lands.
Robert Downey Jr.'s accent....
The queen wasn't as nice as I thought she should be."
257,"This movie was hilarious and action-packed. There's a ton of A-list celebrities in this movie but my faves were Kumail Nanjiani, Craig Robinson, and Michael Sheen.A ton of characters was kind of overwhelming and some characters you kind of forget about and also question why they're there. I wonder if it's a choice for the producers. They want Selena Gomez fans, they want John Cena fans. I think RDJ is and Dolittle title is enough stars to make people go to the movies.It's cute though. I loved the animals' personalities and how they all work together.It's a GO for me because it's worth watching on the big screen. It might be a little fast and the scenes were quick but it's not a bad thing for kids to be honest. It kept my little one attentive.Was it a 10? No, but it's great fun guaranteed!"
258,"And the hits (maybe not!) keep on coming w/this recent remake of Hugh Lofting's beloved character. Having seen the bloated 1967 (& yet Best Picture nominee) original w/Rex Harrison not long ago, this update should've been a walk in the park but within minutes you can see where the CGI ran away w/the production (topping at nearly 180 million dollars) where anthropomorphized animals look the part but sound way too contemporary for their own good (Godfather references!). Robert Downey Jr. is getting some heat here but there are many at the table to point at. Yes I'd like the writer of Traffic (Steven Gaghan who won the Oscar for that script) & the director of the searing drama Syriana to direct a kiddie friendly comedy. Maybe Scorsese can tackle another Casper the Friendly Ghost adventure while we're at it. This hurt!"
259,"Dolittle is a reboot of the 1967 film Doctor Dolittle. This reboot was directed and partly written by Stephen Gaghan, the director of Abandon and Gold.In the film, Dr. John Dolittle (Robert Downey Jr.) withdrew because he lost his wife. Dolittle now lives alone in his country house filled with different animals and has the special gift of being able to talk to all animals. If the young British Queen Victoria becomes seriously ill, Dolittle is asked to look for a medicine. Together with his animal friends and a young student, he made this journey hoping to find a cure before the queen could no longer be saved.This film is intended as a family adventure film, which looks a bit like a mix between the Indiana Jones and Pirates of the Caribbean films filled with CGI animals. Unfortunately, the film comes across as a messy stand-alone change between these films, which is more entertaining for young viewers. The messy story makes the film difficult for older viewers to follow, but for children the film is filled with animals that make various comic comments or undergo actions to entertain them. For older viewers the humor and action of the animals are quickly predictable and if not really funny. Adult viewers can also quickly see that the animals are placed in the film with CGI and thus do not appear to be credible. As an older viewer, you will be left with a long-winded film hoping that you can entertain young family or family members with this. To entertain yourself and the children more, it is better to choose another film to watch together.This role is for Robert Downey Jr. his first new role since 2014, because for this new role he only played the role of Tony Stark / Iron Man in the Marvel films. With all the money he has earned thanks to these films, you would expect that he can now take it easy as an actor. Nevertheless, he chose to play the role of Dolittle in this film, because he is a fan of the old film. He and his wife are therefore producers of this film. Despite this passion from Robert Downey Jr. this film is not his best work. Hopefully in the future he will choose better films to play in. Micael Sheen plays his role as one of the villains in the film in an appropriate way, but he has played better roles in his acting career. The rest of the big cast members talk to the different animals in the film hoping to come across as funny."
260,Let the dust settle on the MCU before you drag us along on a badly written remake. Rex Harrison did it better
261,"What a movie! So funny, good history, good CGI, a great soundtrack, and as always, RDJ is PHENOMENAL. I loved, and I recommend. It's magical and wonderful. Rotten Tomatoes critics don't know what they're talking. Honestly, all this hate is desnecessary!"
262,"Ignore the negative people
Great movie to watch with whole family
My kids loved it and so did I"
263,Great family movie. Though RDJ role was not the best. Would see it again for the comedy.
264,If you say this is for kids you must hate children.
265,"When you want to have a fun and you are not demanding, you will have a good time! Great for families."
266,"Everybody's on a hate train but truth is. This isnt meant to be a super hero movie, it's not supposed to be a great mystery or suspenseful. It's meant to be exactly what it is a fun family movie where animals are up front humans (besides little) take a back seat and we can all sit back and have a few good laughs. It's not meant to be the years box office smash or thrilling mystery so if hour going there for that your out of luck. If your looking for something your kids will enjoy well you can still get a few laughs then this is the movie for you."
267,"I Loved this movie i think it's great funny. Another side of our fav actor. showing us how great an actor he is and he can adabt to any script movie as they come on his way. I just dont understand why people can't accept change it will develop them as human being as well.
Excellent Movie!!! :D"
268,"First of all, I saw cats as well and its horrific, horrible CGI, annoying characters and some pretty bad singing too. So tell me...... how is this movie as bad?I've heard so many people say it's bad because of production issues, or it's bad because high budget. Why would RDJ choose a movie like this? Well first of all, yes I'm aware of the production issues, but it's also a terrific movie with a good plot, heartwarming moments and some pretty hilarious ones aswell, the squirrel a particular one. High budget, the cast and FX cost money and for me worth every penny, visually the movie looks beautiful, really whimsical and fun. Lastly RDJ is trying to distance himself from the last decade of his career, stands to reason.Rate the movie on its merits, that's all I'll say."
269,"I didn't find the plot, the story or the acting to be enjoyable. It was a mishap of adventure, Jack Sparrow and a bad attempt to be funny. Disappointing."
270,"At first i think that it may not interesting
but it was amazing, very very feel good, funny and fantasyAnd i like the song too ""Original""I Love this movie."
271,"Sorry if I'm being disrespectful but this is a movie for kids if you are 50 years old just don't watch it. Everyone enjoyed the movie inside the cinema, no one left. What do you expect? It's not a marvel movie lol 😂. Recommended for ages 13-16. JUST WATCH IT."
272,"This is a Dr. Dolittle set on family adventure mode, with plenty of talking animal fun for the little ones and a few clever winks and nudges for the parents. But as the start of a possible franchise, it's more of a handshake than a high-five. It may not leave you with belly laughs or tunes stuck in your head, but it's eager to please manner doesn't hurt a bit. 7.5/10"
273,"The movie is a filthy rubbish. No plot, no story, no logic and absolutely non sense. It is just an absolute headache. though several superstars gave their voice in the movie along with Robert Downy but it is all in vain. God Bless."
274,I expected high from this movie and from Mr. Robert Downey Jr. but it didn't live up to my expectations. Eddie Murphy's version was way to funnier. They shouldn't have ruined it. I have not expected this kind of movie from Robert Downey Jr. Just after Endgame.
275,"This is absolute trash, from the very stupid villain who has no development whatsoever and is just there, to Robert Downy JR's dreadful accent, take away his accent and he could've been a saving grace. Some of the visuals are just trash, villains turning good in the blink of an eye, so many freaking fart jokes, dramatic moments turned into comedy, need I say more. If you have kids you could probably watch it with them, but don't expect to like it."
276,I genuinely enjoyed this movie! I'd say go watch it for yourself it was a good adventure film
277,"Oh dear. Despite reshoots and a huge amount of publicity here in the UK, the negative reviews kept coming for this film. And sadly in my opinion they are deserved.I'm not saying that the Rex Harrison original, or the Eddie Murphy films based on 'Dr Doolittle' were such classics that the character should be retired, but surely they could've done better than this.I didn't mind Robert D.J, I thought he was good, I didn't mind the Welsh accent, or even the overcomplicated story.What lets this film down is that despite copying the Eddie Murphy films example of having funny people do the animals voices, they get people who aren't funny. Either that or the script doesn't allow them to be.Worst of the bunch by a mile has to be Kumail Nanjiani, who keeps getting these voice over sidekick roles (he also did MiB International) and is about as funny as he was there - not very.This film didn't deserve the kicking it deserved, but it should've been a lot better than it is."
278,"I really liked the first, Eddie Murphy's, one but this is slow, not funny, lean, boring, over acted, nonsense story, DISAPPOINTING in every posible way. The 3 is because of Banderas and the costume design. Otherwise it would have earn a 0."
279,"Really enjoyed this film ,great for any age , adventure and comedy.He's Welsh in this movie and does a brilliant Welsh accent ,spot on .for me it was even better and funnier as he said a lot of Welsh sayings like ""ych a fi "" with the dragon which made me laugh 😄 tiger scene was funny too .loved the storyline and all actors were great . animals were brilliant and enjoyed from start to finish .I love Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man and in Tropic thunder and he's done a great acting job in this film too ."
280,"I thought the old Doctor Doolittle films weren't bad (although Eddie Murphy should have reconsidered his sequel) this film though was a bit rubbish.I liked Robert Downey Jr in other stuff I've seen - the Marvel films, Sherlock Holmes, US Marshals.
But I thought he honestly didn't do a great performance in this, the accent just sounded wrong and somehow seemed unnatural to be coming from him (he did a great English accent in Sherlock Holmes, why couldn't he do that, after all Eddie Murphy is great at voices but even he stuck to his own voice for Dolittle)And while the story itself sounded good it was not very well executed, it felt at times like I was watching something a cross between Polar Express and Narnia.
I get that Dolittle is a man who can talk to animals, but how can he talk to multiple creatures at once, and they can communicate with each other? That's just wrong even in this contextThere was a lot of humour which sometimes was funny but frankly most of the time was just cringy."
281,We enjoyed the movie! Very entertaining! Visual effects very creative! Plenty of laughs and of. Course Robert Downey Jr. Family friendly movie.
282,"I must admit I watch this movie together with my 12 years old daughter. And I found it's one of the best movies since recent years, my daughter rate it high as 9 score.(she is picky than me.)As a mom I must educate my daughter about something important for her future life's choices. The reasons we enjoy it, is it's magically very good at bringing back those traditional values which are losing in many movies, like love, magical, compassion, friendship, kindness, truthful, forgiveness, brave, accept yourself, never give up, care about animals, etc. These values are very hard to find in mass media products nowadays. I don't want any violence or cheating, sexual/abuse content for her movies, but movies really changed a lot, I always need to borrow some movies from library made even 20 years ago. Younger girls now like makeup Bloggers, chatting for crush all the time, don't care about responsibilities of society, studying, future or care about other people very much.I feel this movie made us very happy and comfortable, but if you are expecting special effects, or something can make you feel very exciting, maybe you won't like it. If you wanna enjoy the soothing with your girlfriend, or educate your children what is good and bad, what about love and forgiveness, fame and money are not important which also cannot exist long, and can never exchange happiness, you will love this movie."
283,"Dolittle tells the story of Dr. John Dolittle(Robert Downey Jr.). Dr. Dolittle can talk to animals & specialises in healing them.Dolittle is a good film. Director Stephen Gaghan has given us a movie that is funny, filled with adventure & can be watched by the whole family. The animals made completely using CGI, look absolutely real. The rest of the visual effects are fantastic, as well. The main flaw of this film is that, the jokes for the most part are silly & cater mainly to kids. The adventure set pieces are the highlight of the movie. The 3D is eye-popping. Robert Downey Jr. is brilliant as Dr. John Dolittle. However, Downey Jr.'s British accent seems a tad bit forced. Antonio Banderas is awesome as King Rassouli. Michael Sheen is good as Dr. Blair Mudfly. Harry Collett is adorable as Tommy Stubbins. Jim Broadbent, Jessie Buckley and Carmel Laniado are amazing as Lord Thomas Badgley, Queen Victoria and Lady Rose, respectively. The vocal performances are another highlight of the film. Emma Thompson, Rami Malek, John Cena, Kumail Nanjiani, Octavia Spencer, Tom Holland, Craig Robinson, Ralph Fiennes, Selena Gomez and Marion Cotillard are spectacular as Poly, Chee-Chee, Yoshi, Plimpton, Dab-Dab, Jip, Kevin, Barry, Betsy and Tutu, respectively. The supporting cast is impressive. Dolittle is not a must watch. However, it's worth a watch with your kids, as they will have an absolute blast!"
284,"Even though Dolittle is a chaotic mess with a puzzling performance by Robert Downey Jr., at the end of the day it's a harmless flick that the kiddos will enjoy."
285,"I saw ""Dolittle"", starring Robert Downey Jr.-the Iron Man movies, The Singing Detective; Antonio Banderas-The 33, Machete Kills; Michael Sheen-Prodigal Son_tv, the Underworld movies and Harry Collett-Dunkirk, The Hive_tv.
This is the....well, I don't really know how many previous Doctor Dolittle movies there have been. I know there was one in the 1960's and then the Eddie Murphy ones in the 1990's. Anyway, this is a new reboot with Robert playing the title character, Dolittle-they dropped the 'Doctor' in the title but he is still a doctor-the human that can talk to animals. You also get a little backstory about Robert's lady love, who died in a shipwreck. Robert is asked to help save the Queen from a mysterious sickness, which leads him to follow a trail that his lost love was on before her death-she had left a journal of her adventures-that will lead to a cure for the Queen. Antonio plays the father of Robert's lady love and he does not like Robert-you know how some fathers can get, about no man is good enough for their daughters. Michael is sent by the palace to follow Robert and monitor his mission and Harry is a young boy that wants to become Robert's apprentice. There are a lot of famous voices you might recognize doing the voices of the animals, including Emma Thompson, Octavia Spencer, John Cena, Rami Malek, Tom Holland and Selena Gomez and Robert does an English accent while being a little eccentric. The movie is not bad but it just didn't work for me. It seemed like it was a little discombobulated or something, like they weren't sure what direction they wanted to go in.
It's rated ""PG"" for action, rude humor and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 41 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD but I guess it would be alright, as a rental."
286,"I went into this movie with no real expectations at all, but I think the fact that my friend and I both laughed genuinely several times during the film says enough to know that it's just a good movie."
287,Such a travesty when a film is beautifully produced with such a great cast but let down by scripting that just isn't funny. Accents didn't work with the period...wasn't working for me. Was looking forward to seeing Downey's take on this great children's classic
288,"We really enjoyed this movie in family!!! recommend for all audiences.
Has so many diversion and good effects."
289,Great movie with a fantastic cast backing it up. It's a must see
290,Obviously seeing Robert Downey jr. In something other than a marvel movie is amazing. I loved the movie! The Welsh accent he does just adds to his character. It's nothing like Eddie Murphy's dr Doolittle but that's good I love this version as much as the other. Its hilarious and definitely worth the watch!!
291,I fell asleep because everything is predictable even the jokes are not even funny. No idea what is happening to films nowadays they are rushed with zero story..
292,Dolittle was the best movie then the one with Eddie Murphy. You should go and see it while it's still in theaters you will like it
293,"Watched this yesterday and it was absolutely charming, lighthearted and so funny! A full theater with applause at the end full of kids who didn't move! Please ignore the awful critics this is a sweet family movie and right in the vein of the books😊 Lots of laugh out loud moments!"
294,"God knows why he chose to do a welsh accent. Apparently he made the decision himself and had training, for me not good enough training. I was more focused on his accent than anything else. Also, half the time it LOOKS like he's being dubbed over but I think it's because he's doing this strange thing with his mouth to pull off the supposed welsh."
295,It had a lot of potential. I wish they would have focused more on his relationships with the animals.
296,I'm not sure why the reviews are so poor - this is a great family movie that we all enjoyed thoroughly.
297,I didn't think this movie was a garbage fire. It's fairly entertaining but mediocre. Would only recommend if you have a kid that's really into animals. I did like the ending though. There were at least a couple moments that made me laugh.
298,"I'm not sure why the ratings for this movie are so low. Was hesitant to watch because of the bad reviews, but saw how many people were impressed. Glad we gave it a chance. Was so cute and funny. The whole family enjoyed it!"
299,"You didn't have to be much of a tea leaf reader to see that the writing was on the wall for Dolittle's failure fairly early on.Facing release delays, re-shoots and some fairly inconspicuous re-dubbings that are evident in the final product, Stephan Gaghan's $175 million dollar production and reimagining of Hugh Lofting's famed character received a critical drubbing only bettered by Cats in this year's holiday release schedule as the Robert Downey Jr. portrayed animal doctor headed on his way to commercial failure and audience disappointment.In many ways, Gaghan's dull and lifeless computer generated centric adventure makes Eddie Murphy's late 90's and early 2000's Dr. Dolittle offerings appear to be minor masterpieces of family entertainment, as he and his lead actor get lost amongst a boorish plot filled with tasteless jokes, that somehow required 5 able minded screenwriters to come up with.The worst thing about this wannabe family favourite is the fact that it's not even so bad its good like Cats now infamous midnight screenings attest to, as Dolittle is instead just endlessly uninteresting, lame and sad in the way in which its clearly hating it lead and collection of side characters and voice actors are wasted in a big budget affair that should've been able to deliver something a lot more entertaining than it managed to do with this final offering.Produced by his wife Susan, the only excuse Downey Jr. has for putting his name and horrible Welsh (at least I think its Welsh) accent to this cinematic turkey, is that its ties of love and family bonds that lead him down this path, as after the highs of his performance in last year's Avengers: Endgame, it's sad to see the usually charismatic performer deliver such a tonally awkward and forgettable turn, especially as a character that we know can be such a source of solid entertainment.With Downey Jr on as bad as it gets form and with the films terrible plot consistently at play (how did dragons end up in this or a make-up clad Antonio Banderas?), Gaghan's and the films last hope was to somehow find comedic gold or energy in its cast of real-life and computer generated creatures but that was not forthcoming.The animals found in Dolittle look cute and are sure to please the little ones in an aesthetically pleasing way but much like the film they find themselves in, their devoid of much charm or material worthy of the voice talent behind them, with none of the likes of Emma Thompson, Oscar winner Rami Malek or comedy players Craig Robinson or Kumail Nanjiani able to make their animal incarnations better than the film they're a part of.Final Say -Dolittle is bad, not bad as in a completely unwatchable way but bad as in sad. A sorrowful waste of talent, money and material, Stephan Gaghan's high-profile misfire is unlikely to ever find many outside of Britney Spears who glowingly endorse it as a fun family entertainment.1 Gorilla masseuses out of 5"
300,"I wasn't ever a big fan of Dr. Dolittle but I have seen the movies bade based on the series of children's books by Hugh Lofting Titled Dr. Dolittle starring Rex Harrison (1967) and Eddie Murphy (1998). I was a little reluctant to watch this new one but knowing it's Robert Downy Jr is starring I had to see it. RDJ seems to nails every role he takes perfectly given he has been with the Marvel franchise for 10 years. He even played Sherlock Holmes (2009) exceptionally and entertainingly. RDJ did a great job at being Dr. Dolittle , the accent, the hair , the interactions with his animal buddies and he touched my heart in a specific scene just as he did in iron man.
The movie is about Dolittle who has lost his wife and exiled himself from humanity living with animals. Then lady rose seeks his help to save a very important person in a matter of life and death situation. Therefore he embarks on a journey in the search of an island to look for a cure with an apprentice and his dear animal friends.
Dolittle is filled with adventure, loveable animal characters and a straight to the point storyline that is simple, enjoyable and family friendly. Such an amazing number of actors voicing the animals including some big names (Tom Holland, Octavia Spencer, Rami Malek and Emma Thompson). I was very happy to see Antonio Banderas amongst the cast of the movie. I think the last movie for kids he was in was Spykids (2001). (Kumail Nanjani). The Squirrel (Craig Robinson) made me laugh by saying the most unexpected thing given his situation from one specific scene lol. Emma Thompson voiced the duck , you would love her, motherly and sensible and wise. Stubbins (Harry Collett) was my least favorite character he wasn't given much of a role. He was awfully quiet most of the time.
I was very surprised that the original score for the movie was composed by Danny Elfman. For his music is usually always darker and easily recognizable given his work with Tim burton most of the time. I though it was the work of Hans Zimmer at first, because it reminded me a lot of Pirates of the Carribean (2003). Interestingly too, the Director Stephen Gaghan, has never worked on a children's movie before , this movie is completely out of his element ( Syriana, Traffic, Gold, Abandon) and I loved the fact that RDJ was involved in the production of the movie (Team Downey Productions) founded by him and his wife.
It's memorable, its fun , its adventurous, watch it on a weekend night with your family. I would."
301,"So many emotions, acting everything were good messages were nice and a great movie Very enjoyable Need more"
302,Much better than the other two! Funny and keeps you engage the whole time!
303,I put it on for my kids to watch and I'm the one who watched it and really enjoyed it and when I realised that Robert Downey jr was using a Welsh accent I was blown away because he chose to use a Welsh accent and I'm very proud of him for doing so and Michael Sheen plus Joan Page in it
304,"For me quite interesting family movie, even everything is easily predictable but love to watch with family. Good animation animals look real and with good intentions and adventure in it"
305,"This is one of the worst family films I have ever watched. I couldn't wait for it to end. The weird welsh accent from Robert D-Jr is terrible. The movie is just about poor jokes and animals with voices that do not suit them at all. The story is so flat and boring, the CGI is bad. CGI is good if it was an animated movie...but it isn't. It's poor. All the CGI looks exactly that. In my opinion you shouldn't know it's not real. Sadly the CGI was obvious and cartoony and poorly executed. The thing that is most lacking in this movie is any amount of charm. There is no charm in this movie. It is Forgettable and a complete waste of anyone's money."
306,"It's just awful. Downey's attempt at a Welsh accent makes him indecipherable the majority of the time, the dialogue in general was actually painful to sit through, the CGI is ""meh"" and the plot is mangled.
Anyone saying there's nothing to criticise here must have seen a different cut of the movie with different actors, script and visuals.By all means put it on for the kids, just don't sit through it with them.Tripe."
307,"This is a family movie that does not leave me explain things to a little one such as double entendres. You get a movie that will make you laugh, smile, think, and encourages the love for all living creatures. Is it the best film ever no but it was good enough for me to take the time to review and hopefully you will take the time to see this movie."
308,It's not a terrible movie. But it's mostly for children. It felt like i was watching a 5 hour movie in 2 hours time ( as in it was all over the place...) it all went by so quick. Rdj put up a silly voice i didn't like. But nonetheless it looked good
309,A fun- filled and entertaining romp but who is Dolittle and where does he come from? Anthony Hopkins meets Pirates of the Caribbean meets Cornwall meets Ireland?
310,"The cgi animals were good 'actors'. RDJ's accent was terrible. I don't know which one he was trying pull, honestly I can't understand what he was babbling. The storyline - messy! Jump cuts, no build ups, no thrills or climax. This was lack of action and performance. Quite disappointed."
311,"Robert Downey Junior plays a very believable Dr Dolittle, the animals are just charming and funny and the storyline was brilliant to, I really really hope they do another one"
312,"Poor plot and unfitting acting. The voices of the animals are nice, but the story line isn't that good."
313,"It seemed such a good idea I suppose to have Robert Downey Jr play Dolittle, talking to the animals, with Stephen Gaghan directing and a host of comedic voices to spar with the good doctor. Living alone, except for the CGI animals, in his manor bequeathed by the young Queen Victoria, played by Jessie Buckley. But now Victoria is gravely ill, and Carmel Laniado's sweet Lady Rose requests the good doctor's services to attend her. But Dolittle is no suave Rex Harrison. Uncombed and unkempt he has shunned human contact since the death of his explorer wife. And that unusual accent!, which I assumed was Scottish is Welsh, although you get used to it. But, and here I'm not sure that critics realised it, the film is for children. And half-term is this week.And Dolittle is a very colourful blast of comedy, the human actors ham it up gleefully for their roles, including lovely Antonio Banderas. And the animal voices include the talents of Emma Thompson as good mate and conscience, Polly, Rami Malek as Chee-Chee the timid gorilla and John Cena as the always cold polar bear Yoshi. They all play their big parts in Dolittle's life.The day Lady Rose arrives Polly saw Harry Collett's Tommy inadvertently shoot a squirrel. She intimates he follow her to the manor, the poor orphan boy maybe can be Dr Dolittle's apprentice he suggests, after the doctor and his animals have saved the poor squirrel, voiced by Craig Robinson. I think Kevin Hart could equally have been the squirrel. And they do call him Kevin. Tommy is looking for a new home as his Uncle is a hunter and there are only so many times you can miss. But Dolittle refuses, so Tommy sneaks a ride to the palace anyway. The doctor eventually persuaded to attend the Queen, because if she dies he loses the manor, and it is everyone's homeAfter his examination, and a chat with an octopus, Dolittle determines Victoria has been poisoned, and the cure is the unknown Eden fruit from an equally unknown island that only his wife knew of. A Pirates of the Caribbean style journey must be undertaken, but Jim Broadbent's Lord Badgley implores Royal doctor, Michael Sheen's Dr Müdfly, a former classmate and rival of Dolittle, to follow them. With ammunition. Victoria the young Queen must not get well. And after a daredevil ride Tommy also makes it onboard the ship, and the adventure to foreign shores begins.Stephen Gaghan has packed the film with stunning scenery, and plenty of action and fun that kids should enjoy. And with cinematography by Guillermo Navarro and music by Danny Elfman there is a wealth of talent involved on and off screen. The CGI menagerie of animals are terrific, all with their own skills and wisdom to impart. Even Barry the tiger with a sore head, and voiced by Ralph Fiennes, plays his part.Watch out for the bats though mid credits. They don't speak our language."
314,"In Victorian England, Dr. John Dolittle (Robert Downey Jr.) can talk to animals. His life is healing animals. His love is his adventurer wife Lily who travels the world saving animals. The Queen gives him an estate for life to do his work. When Lily disappears on one of her adventures, John falls into depression and becomes a shut-in with his animals. Young Tommy Stubbins is forced on a hunting trip and accidentally shots a squirrel. The animal-loving Stubbins takes the squirrel to Dolittle. At the same time, young Lady Rose arrives with the Queen's request for medical help. Dolittle is shocked to discover that the estate for life refers to the Queen's life. He has to save her in order to keep his animal sanctuary. He is frustrated at every turn by rival Dr. Blair Müdfly (Michael Sheen).I expected a lot worst after the reviews. This is bad and the climatic fart joke does not help. I can certainly see what this premise is attempting to be. This should be a lot more like Pirates of the Caribbean. Downey should be a lot more flamboyant but his character is too flat. I understand his depression and that doesn't help either. The boy and the girl need to be the adventuring leads. Quite frankly, the girl could be Downey's sole companion. The boy's not needed and it's rather convenient to have both young people coming to Dolittle at the same time. As for the animals, there are too many of them and they melt together into one sarcastic blob. They need fewer animals so that their individuality can be elevated. It would be so much better if each animal with individual personalities and skills to solve one particular difficulty each in the adventure. I can see where this is trying to go. I can take a lot of this but the fart joke really hurts."
315,"Robert Downy Jr. has moved on from the MCU to play Dolittle, the Aquaman of the land. 'Landman' if you will. But how does this family film featuring talking animals fair? After the horrific musical Cats, that similarly features talking animals; Dolittle has a lot to prove.Dolittle was charming and had a mildly amusing plot, the film is quite interesting in depicting the relationships and interactions between the animals. I thought that it was fun and at times exciting as a family friendly film of this caliber should. However, Downey Jr.'s zany over the top take on Dolittle and accent doesn't really take Dolittle to be one of the all time classic family adventure films. It was enjoyable enough of a movie but mostly due to the animals doing the heavy lifting. Outside of those small 'skits' and sideline bickering the film really doesn't have much substance. A message that is muddled and confusing mixed with not so interesting human characters and we get: Dolittle."
316,"Couldn't finish it.
Made Eddie Murphy out to be a genius with his interpretation.
I couldn't hear the lead half the time.
When will they learn that special effects cannot carry a movie."
317,"Good family film, my kids enjoyed it, I too but some of the voice actors playing the animals were a bit annoying esp the duck. Really hate those who speak in these dialects. Yes your a black actor/actress but I doubt it you speak like that in real life or any black ppl for any matter unless you live in the ""ghetto"". Could not tolerate her annoying voice."
318,"Okay, I seriously don't get the hate? I've even herd people claiming this is the worst movie ever made? This was fantastic kids movie - with a little humour is adults can get. The animal characters were fantastic, the voices were perfect for each role. The plot itself was basic....but it's for kids, so what do you expect? Visually it was great to watch and no doubt my kids will love it for years to come! Lighten up...."

Overall rating 68/100Dolittle is based on an animal doctor who has a breakdown and closes himself off to everyone after the death of his wife. But after the queen falls gravely ill, it's down to Dr Dolittle and his trusted animal companions to help find the cure to help save the monarchy. Dolittle was surprisingly a lot of fun and nowhere near as bad as what critics were saying but it is definitely flawed, lets talk about this more in detail.First of all, the film had breath-taking visuals and well thought out villains. The film was truly visually stunning. With exotic sets and locations that were very pleasing to the eye, or just visual creativity with the incorporation of the animals in different ways, the movie did accomplish a big thing here. And the villains were actually pretty good and well thought out. All the villains had clear motivations so in a way it made it more understandable into why they were doing what they were doing. For example, Michael Sheens character was promised power and a knighthood, Jim Broadbent's character wanted the queen to die so he could ascend the throne. And the tiger was bad because Dolittle abandoned him during the time where he was looking after him to be with his wife. So, kudos to the director and screenwriters for actually having clear motivations for the villains.Next the film had a surprisingly heart-warming tone. Seeing how much Dolittle (Robert Downey Jr) and Tommy (Harry Colette) cared for every single animal and their passion for treating the animals and making them feel better was touching to watch, and who isn't going to find little squirrels adorable. This is also made these characters much more likeable.However, my first two negatives would be Robert Downy Jr's off-putting accent and the films dodgy CGI in places. The creative decision to have Robert Downey Jr playing Dr Dolittle to have a welsh accent was a bit of an odd one. I did get used to it after a while but it was still very distracting and a different accent could have been used to perhaps make his character be treated more seriously. And sadly the CGI was surprisingly bad in places despite its hefty 175m budget. There was just particular scenes where it was really obvious it was green screen or fake especially when Stubbens was riding the giraffe, sadly these were very noticeable so had to be mentioned.Next, I would like to say for the most part the humour landed and was pretty funny throughout. Robert Downey Jr had excellent comedic timing through the duration of the movie and his comedic chemistry with his animals was infectious and drew many laughs from me. And a lot of the animals were very funny, with distinct personalities and things that made them funny in their own individual ways. However, I do have to say that in the second half of the film the humour started to fall flat and the tone became more inconsistent. Sadly as the film transitioned to the second half the jokes became more stale and just weren't working as well, therefore effecting the films comedic and charming tone, which was a worry for me whilst watching but luckily they managed to redeem themselves towards the end but the great tone that they managed to achieve was not successfully executed throughout the whole film.Next, I have to applaud the performance from Harry Colette and the voice performances. Harry truly did a charming performance as his character was extremely likeable throughout the whole film, his character showed a true passion for wanting to take care of the animals which was great to see. And his chemistry with Robert was very interesting and often heart-warming as his character gave Dolittle a purpose again. And the whole voice cast was fantastic. With a surprising amount of big names it was just fun to see everyone interact with each other in entertaining and funny ways and there was no weak links everyone had great comedic moments and enthusiasm.My final two negatives would be that it was generic and predictable. The film despite being visually creative sadly lacked creativity with its plot. We have seen this kind of adventure movie done multiple times before especially with a sick queen or family member and they didn't do anything to differ from films with this same plot, so this was a shame. And sadly, it was very predictable. You could guess who the villains were before it was even revealed, and you knew how the story was going to pan out. Yes, they made the journey to the ending fun, but it would have been nice to have some things unexpected.But my final two positives would be Robert Downey Jr and Doolittle's character development. Robert Downey jr was just fantastic in this film. He was funny, charming, his campy over the top performance fitted perfectly and his relationships with the other characters were a delight to watch, he was just perfect for this role. And his character development of losing his wife and being a recluse, but then having his relationship with his animals threatened reigniting the adventure inside of him was a nice touch to the film and his improved relationship with humans with Stubbens was a nice touch as well.Overall Dolittle is a fun adventure. With excellent visuals, a fantastic tone, and fantastic performances especially from its lead actor. But sadly doesn't do anything new for the genre and is held back from being great with its inconsistent tone and weak plot."
320,"Dolittle could have been so much better.
Its got a great cast and seemingly a licence to do whatever it wanted involving cute fluffy animals - but theres something missing stopping it from being a classic.
Its not terrible by any means - I've been forced to watch far worse - its just a bit underwhelming (and I really wanted to like it, being a big fan of the musical, and also the Eddie Murphy version).
Take the IMDB description for example ""A physician discovers that he can talk to animals."". Not only is this description lacking in any excitement, its also factually incorrect. He does not discover he can talk to animals in the movie - its set several years down the line when he is living as a recluse with his animals.
The supporting cast are mostly good as are the voice cast.
The back story is a little sketchy - more could have been included on why the Queen is indebted to Dolittle - but without it the story does get moving quite quickly, which is probably a good thing.
Part of the problem is Downey Junior himself. I found it hard to care about Dolittle for the first half of the film. More character development would have helped me buy into him and feel more sympathetic.
The accent. Its mostly a Welsh accent with trips into an American-English hybrid. The latter is expected, the former is unexpected. Theres no reason why Dolittle can't have a Welsh accent, but it needs to A - sound Welsh and B - be believable / realistic. It does nether of these things and this is distracting.
I struggled with the sound (this may be down to the cinema I was in) but Downey's voice was often hard to hear properly, as were some of the animals.
There is lots of humour and lots of laugh out loud moments that had the whole room laughing.
I've read some of the reviews - including one saying its worse than Cats (which I actually enjoyed) - and I don't think its as bad as most of them claim, I just think it could have been so much better.That said, the kids (who are the target audience) loved every second."
321,"Dr Dolittle has to give up his self-imposed exile to save the Queen of England.The great cast, great performance, nice CGI and good humour rescue this movie from its rambling story and bad editing. Maybe the director didn't have time to shoot everything or maybe it just needed an extra month in post-production but something was rushed.I left a bit disappointed that it could have been a better movie. The children really enjoyed it but did get bored in places. And one operation proves that you can take toilet humour too far; an enema would have been funnier."
322,"What a load of pompous people critics are.. this is a funny fantasy movie .. it has a stream of silly ness in it which is great just makes you smile.Okay I am English and I get it so maybe that's it the cast are great.. lose a mark for it being Blenheim Palace not Buckingham palace and the ""lady bug"" right at the end.. it's England that insects called a ladybird. 😂All in all a Princess Bride for the future .. history will prove me right"
323,"Dolittle has it's problems, a couple of the jokes aren't funny, some of it's incredible cast are wasted in one note performances and the CG has brief moments of looking poor (although the CG is still great overall) but it's still a really fun adventure that's fun, funny and fast paced. Robert Downey Jr. gives a dedicated performance and Michael Sheen is really good as a gleefully over the top villain. The voice acting by John Cena, Emma Thompson, Ralph Fiennes and Rami Malek are all good. It's well filmed with fantastic music by Danny Elfman."
324,"I'd write a personal note to RDJ for this one; but, his agent probably wouldn't forward it.
Rex Harrison's performance of Dr. Dolittle backed by Anthony Newly (1967) is a classic favorite of mine. This version was not even an attempt at a remake.
Although the romantic spin evident in the first 30 seconds took me to a place I did not expect, there is something about RDJ's performance, at the mercy of the writers, that made me face what I have tucked away. So, I'd thank the production crew for that.
Thoroughly enjoyed, laughed, and my eyes dripped a little. My animals have always had conversations and personalities, since 1981; and, I am grateful to have a modern take on the Dr. that talks to the animals (squeaks, and squawks and walks with the animals) to share with my loved ones.
Well done."
325,"This is an entertaining film, not a masterpiece. Robert Downey Jr always seems to be an enjoyment to watch, seems to be having a blast making this and probably knowing this is not a great film, but fun nothing more.
The talking animals are ok, sometimes the CGI is noticeable, and the rest of the supporting cast are pretty awesome too. Effects are descent, nothing really great though. But Robert Downey Jr has Doolittle in my opinion is what makes the movie watchable. Seems like he was little inspired by Hugh Laurie performance from the T.V. show House(2004-2012), and he does with such comic wit, and plays off everybody quite well. Not a bad film, but also not a great film either, but just fun."
326,"I don't normally write reviews, but I just don't get why this has such a low marking on IMDB. It's a nice family movie. Well done. Animations for the animals are lifelike. I was very entertained. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to see a normal fun entertaining movie."
327,I almost didn't go to see this movie after reading an article online that its first week was a flop. I didn't want to read users reviews because I didn't want anything to be given away or persuaded. I REALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE. I RECOMMEND EVERYONE SHOULD GO SEE THIS IN THEATERS. The only criticism I have are: 1. The fox looks extra fake. 2. Dolittle's accent isn't that believable. 3. The boy just so happens to accidently stumble by Dolittle's gate. 4. The magic fruit works instantly after only a few drops.
328,"The reviews made it seem like it was preposterously awful, when it was ACTUALLY good ol' fun. Some good laughs, great acting, fun adventurous story."
329,A bit more was expected since Robert Downey's presence. Visually appealing but not sure if everyone felt the same.
330,"I went into this movie expecting an expose of the human condition, an existential explanation for the reason of being. In essence what it means to be human. I was a little disappointed at first to find that the production used computer generated imagery instead of actually training and teaching the animal actors to speak coherent English. I must admit it was quite a shock to discover that John Doolittle was in fact Welsh and not English, a fact completely overlooked in the history books. Robert Downey's portrayal of the titular main character is an endearing and frustrating one. You definitely empathise with the character and the feelings of loss and regret are universal. I can imagine if you spent any length of time with the actual Doctor you would be tearing your hair out within hours.
The other casting choices are indeed spot on Michael Sheen as the main antagonist and the always exceptional Jim Broadbent as the evil puppet master.
Unfortunately in this reviewers personal opinion the junior members of the cast have let the side down somewhat Harry Collett is passable as young master Stubbins but Carmel Laniado is clearly just playing straight off the page there is no depth to her character and we never delve deeply enough into her motivation or the complexities of the relationship between her and our own beloved queen Victoria portrayed by Jessie Buckley who for the most part is just required to lay there and take it. In summary if you're looking for Oscar worthy philosophical study of irrational motivation in the human psychological development look elsewhere but if you, like me enjoy a bit of escapism in a movie marketed to and for CHILDREN, don't take yourself too seriously enjoy it and the wonder of being a child again."
331,"I took a group of 7-10 year olds for a bday. They loved it! I thought it was clever and funny. RDJ was great. If you want to take your kids, do it! Great way to spend a dreary winter day."
332,"The first 15 minutes of the movie were odd to say the least, Robert Downey Jr making animal noises was not something I thought I'd ever hear. However, once you get used to the peculiar things this movie offers, and accept them for how they are, you will find the movie quite enjoyable. At least I did. It's a children's movie so of course there are some jokes that are funnier for the smaller of us but even as an adult I caught myself laughing a lot. You have to accept that the movie is a little different, and then you will see that it is not so bad as people make it out to be."
333,"Thoroughly enjoyed this action packed and funny film, so did my 7, 9 and 11 year olds. No idea why it has been slated so much. Watch without reading pettifogged perceptions and maybe you may just enjoy the ride."
334,"This is a nice movie to watch with your kids, animals are greatly done, we really had a good time. I recommend it"
335,"This is an excellent family movie. Relaxing, fun to watch, loaded with witty humor and just the right amount of action! My family enjoyed it very much."
336,"My initial thought was ""another Dolittle movie..."" I was expecting a redo of other versions but this was nothing like I expected. Instead, itas very enjoyable and engaging. Good, fun adventure for the whole family, from child to grandpa. The animals talked but it wasn't annoying. Don't leave the theater when the credits start rolling."
337,"I thought it was a lovely, heartwarming movie, and a perfect escape from the current chaos of life. I enjoyed it very much. RDJ did an amazing job!"
338,"This movie is getting way too many negative reviews.Sure, it's silly and not at all like the original movie with Rex Harrison, but this movie stands on its own. Robert Downey Junior does a great job, and once you get used to his accent it's actually quite funny. I laughed out loud a few times so mission accomplished in my book. And the CGI is awesome too by the way.9/10 for this little gem.And for all the critics that are trying to ruin this movie for everybody else... go watch a costume drama instead and stop reviewing comedies if you don't appreciate some good old fun."
339,"I won't review this movie as I would a movie intended for mature audiences.
(If you are so inclined to see my other reviews, I tend to tear movies apart.)That said, Dolittle is a fun movie, and children will enjoy it. Adults will too, who appreciate movies that are geared for children.
I found it refreshing to watch a movie with no adult inclinations whatsoever.
I found the entire cast to be great, whether live actors, or actors voicing the CGI animals. It's a nice story. Remember to sit through the credits at the end, there's another scene after.Okay, I can't help it. I have to mention this.
I love Robert Downey, Jr, and he's very good in this.
However!
I had trouble watching Robert being mousy with a British accent. He does it well but I still had trouble with it. The reason being I imagined Robert in his scenes handling his situations differently as Tony Stark. I imagined Robert blowing up his enemies in this movie as Iron Man. We must get past that!
Robert deserves that.
Enjoy this movie with your kids. They'll like it."
340,"So it's Sunday night, there's a storm outside, I'm bored from doing nothing all day. Why not go see a movie? Nothing really peaks my interest but Dolittle seems tolerable. After all I enjoyed the movies as a kid, I like RDJ and Tom Holland. Why not?Not gonna lie, though, I didn't have super high expectations of this movie based off of the trailer, but I'm a sucker for a good adventure movie so I figured maybe I'll end up enjoying it. Hoo boy did I!
First of all that animated opening was incredibly beautiful and charming. Got me right off the bat! The plot was interesting as well. I loved seeing all the weird shenanigans Dolittle comes up with like the whale/boat scene... Like... what??? And the 'stomach ache' scene (won't spoil more than that) had me sitting there like ""Did they just do that?""This movie was charming and hilarious and I seriously enjoyed it."
341,"What were you expecting? It's a fun movie great escapism. Not an Academy Award but who cares. An enjoyable movie for once, NO animals get killed"
342,"RDJ, the carrying of the real story You can play around 10% of what Tony is, the rest of you design your personality well, even the accent and tone. RDJ is considered another skilled performer. You are very detailed. So in this story the script is not much. I tried to help each other as well. Which some scenes are considered less but very much.The joke of a funny story Some of these scenes were loud. Considered very little pearl Maybe it's because of all beings, their personalities are also clear. When you joke, it looks funny.What I don't like is the simplicity and smoothness of the script, so it makes the movie less exciting, and with the lack of dimension of the movie it makes it impossible to get into the drama. Honestly, it felt like the director was not good at doing this kind of movie, the movie didn't look so much continuity, it ended up being bluntly, I didn't know it."
343,4/10 - an impressive voice cast cannot save this CGI-live action hybrid from mediocrity
344,"Robert Downey Junior sounds like he has been dubbed, the acting is awful. It's hard to believe these are all famous talented actors."
345,A good humourous film. A short time spending with family with laughter. The bad thing I felt was that the movie is little bit long otherwise a well done family entertainment.
346,"I enjoyed this movie, it's not an Oscar but it sure was fun and enjoyable. Exceeded all my expectations. I don't even read reviews from critics."
347,"Much better than the other critics would have you think, this film is visually spectacular, with a great all-star voice cast and a very family-friendly plot. Robert Downey Jr. is sometimes hard to understand what, with his bizarre accent and the direction is somewhat disjointed at times, with action set pieces not playing out as smoothly as they could. Ultimately it's a good film to watch with the kids. The family pets will like it as well. I'm still a big fan of the musical version made in the 60's, with the ""Push me - Pull you"" creature and Rex Harrison"
348,"Good movie. Great for kids and adults who love Fantasy films.
Funny, lighthearted.
Well worth the watch.
Animal characters were so funny. Great casting.
Don't listen to the haters. Watch this movie."
349,"Not RDJ we are used to seeing in Iron Man, but we are getting to see another side of him, and I can appreciate that! This movie is silly and fun. Loved it!"
350,"I liked Robert in a new role. It isn't action or SF.
It's funny and family 😅"
351,"I dont know how this movie turned out like it did and I dont think I want to know. The whole scene with the dragon is just torture to sit through. I love the original and was hoping this could be that for a new generation but it's just a bunch of stupid, not funny jokes, and iron man's performance is really off putting and awkward. The child characters are awful, if they weren't there the movie would be no different. Even as a child I would have hated this."
352,It's a nice family movie...with funny scenes...not boring neither unsuccessful!
353,"I suppose kids could like it, not sure. Personality I couldn't get over dolittle's voice. He sounded like he was dubbed by someone who was whispering the entire dialog because he was ashamed his mom would hear him in the other room."
354,"I loved this movie. It had great charm and the acting from the cast was a tour de force, especially, Robert Downey's performance as the title character. The concept of understanding the language of the very life-like CGI animals and hearing them speak was great fun. The whole movie was a joy from start to finish. Easily the best movie of 2020."
355,"Dr. Dolittle (Robert Downey Jr.), the man who can talk to the animals is brought out of solitude after the death of his wife some years before to reignite a previous unfinished adventure.A candy coloured and lively family film that nevertheless lacks some of the naive charm of the flawed and marmite 1967 DR. DOLITTLE. It makes the predictable error of overloading on CGI and might have been better served as an animated Disney movie."
356,"Pretty good movie, wasn't something special but this watchable before sleep, family friendly."
357,"Very interesting take on the remake.
Of course, it wouldn't be a film without the incomparable RDJ... Of course, the talking parrot was very bossy, & the shy gorilla Wow. Other than that. That's why I rated it a 7.."
358,"And I enjoyed it as well... Good adventure movie for the kids and moms n dads too who are old enough to remember the magic such tales gave us as kids. Underrated but it's not a movie for everyone.. (the to cool for school teens, whom most of the low ratings seem to come from) Although some of the supposed professional critics didn't seem to like it either. I assume they saw Downey listed as the star and assumed it would be up there with his other movies... but it's a kids movie for sure. I think kids movies should be rated with that fact in mind. Great Family night movie."
359,"Nothing memorable...nor very well done. Young children will enjoy the silly antics and animals but, although we were able to sit through the whole movie, it was not as entertaining for adults or older children. First, Downey decided not to play Dr. Dolittle as the intelligent, dignified, brave gentleman Rex Harrison played him as in the original 1967 movie, but instead as a bumbling, rambling, disheveled mess. Second, Robert Downey struggled through a Welsh accent that made him difficult to understand as he mumbled through his lines, and unfortunately, the other actors were just mediocre... well, in their defense they were given a lazy script and the plot was nothing new. On the plus side, the movie was colorful, there were a few funny scenes and some fun, adorable animal characters. It's kid-friendly, other than one or two attempts at adult humor that will go over the heads of most youngsters, this movie was clean with no bad language and a tiny bit of potty humor. Your 3-8year-old will probably enjoy the animal escapades but many pre-teens/teens will be bored In My Humble Opinion."
360,"Dolittle is a family movie, that's for sure, more for kids than for adults if you ask me. That said it was entertaining even if the story is a bit simple and cheesy. The production was good though, nice CGI's, good cinematography. The acting wasn't bad even though I found Robert Downey Jr's character annoying to watch. His way of talking, Welsh or English (whatever), was very monotone and bugged me the whole time. Some might like it, I thought it wasn't a good impression at all, I never heard a Welsh talk like that. The story will please a lot of children so it was not all a waste."
361,Robert downy Jr can be in a better film other than playing iron man in the MCU.Overall it wasn't that bad and it has random funny scenes.
362,"This movie is ... ok, quite simply. No more no less. Easy story. Ok effects. It's a children's movie ... My son likes it ... I like it... I've always liked Robert and always will. His cool style and radiance always shine through in everything he does. This movie does not end up in his top5 and will not be rewarded with any prestigious awards but it offers a moment of easy entertainment and also some laughs here and there."
363,"We watched this as a family and thought it was absolutely brilliant, my two boys were in stitches! A thoroughly enjoyable family movie."
364,"A new adaptation of the animal-speaking doctor. Despite it is the Nth adaptation, it contains much more similarity to the Rex Harrison's version.As we didn't see Chee-chee, Poly (Polynesia) or Jip in the Murphy's version, they brought them back to the story ... with success. The dragon maybe a bit exaggeration.They made a good frame story that explains the Doctor's misanthropy, but soon it turns out, that it was only some kind of depression and he only needed a push to get back to the track.Tommy's endurance and bravery fits into the story ... a good hearted boy, who could not kill animals.A very good mixture of fantasy, love story, jealousy, loyalty and the essential humour."
365,"I'm glad I chose to watch it before the reviews. Don't get the negativity - funny, easy to watch, kids loved it, didn't annoy me. It's not a twisted plotline, you know what's going to happen but who cares? It was charming and the cinematography was stunning."
366,A wonderful group of misfits learning to work together for the good of all. This movie was so much fun.
367,"It's a classy, tasteful, pleasant, original, throwback kids movie.If you like that pure-hearted, classic kids movie feel; you'll love this. It reminds me of the Baron Munchausen but more light-hearted.I will say that RDJ was obviously trying to be different and prove that he has range, at times it felt unnatural because he was trying to be so different.Overall though, such a full good kids movie. A rare type of kids movie these days!"
368,"It's a movie about a goofy doctor that can talk to animals. Don't expect the amazing craft of storytelling and production to be on full display. This is a time filling semi fun film. I liked it though. It is cool to watch CGI animals interact with each other. It's a fun movie for kids and for adults that want to turn off the brain. There's a place for movies like this, these movies serve a purpose. this movie did a good job at serving that purpose. I enjoyed it. So did my kids and so did the other adults. A good lighthearted kids movie."
369,The way the animals interacted was great wee bit of a rushed ending
370,"After researching this movie, I have to agree that people who are slamming RDJ's accent are uninformed. I listened to some clips of Welsh dialects, and he actually did a nice job. Aside from his accent, the movie is hilarious, meaningful, and very fun."
371,"Difficult start to the story but once underway I liked this movie.
My 9yr old daughter enjoyed it very much and found it funny and entertaining.
Only thing I thought was a bit strange was Robert Downey's accent, went from Welsh to Scottish then northern English, I really think American actors must get coached if playing English characters otherwise can be a bit fake for native English speakers.
Saying that all in all was a nice family movie."
372,"I watched this at home on BluRay from our public library.The IMDb rating seems a bit low, this is a very well-made and entertaining movie, with A-list actors, even those who voice animated characters.Queen Victoria is ill and dying, in talking to a squid in a tank suspects she is being poisoned. They set off on a long cruise to find a particular plant that no one knows for sure exists but could cure the Queen.Lots of green screen and CGI are involved, as such it takes on the look of a cartoon more than a conventionally filmed movie. It reminded me of watching Saturday morning cartoons with a few live characters.Overall very entertaining, I watched it again 3 months later (September 2020), this time with my wife also, and enjoyed it even more the second time. Plus I am a big Jessie Buckley fan, she plays the sick Queen, ultimately a small part but she lights up the screen."
373,"I'm very surprised by such a low score. Perhaps people expected the movie ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" to be exciting, and that's why they hate this one.But this movie is a little different. The plot is banal and very similar to a fairy tale. And everything is very banal. But in spite of everything, it turned out to be very warm, kind and sincere.Appropriate acting. Good graphics and cute images of animals. Personally, I enjoyed watching the movie with my family.In fact, it's a good family fairy tale movie. Definitely such a movie will appeal to children. 7/10"
374,"It's a good movie. I like a joyful adventure story and adorable animals. RDj's performance might have leaked some residual scents of Tony Stark, but still exceptional. Anyway such a delight watching it."
375,"We have varities of movies. Stop expecting everything from a single one. This movie is intended for children & family. Adults can enjoy this thoroughly like me. In its own genre, it's the best of this year I believe."
376,The story about Dr. Dolittle has massively changed and got an upgrade over the old comedy version of Ed Murphy. Good job.
377,"This movie received a lot of hate from critics and audiences. So, when I decided to watch it after careful consideration, I was bemused. Bemused that this was an entertaining little picture. Every scene appears to have been designed with humour and I quite enjoyed it.RDJ tries on a strange accent that's part-Sherlock Holmes, part-Willem Dafoe. So, there was a bit of trouble trying to understand what he was saying. Apart from RDJ, no other cast member is given the chance to shine. Even with voice actors, Emma Thompson, John Cena and Rami Malek have a lot of lines while other voice actors (Selena Gomez or Marion Cotillard for instance) have one or two lines. So, it's perhaps not the best use of talent but, the presence of such names in this little movie is overwhelming.I understand that this really isn't a ""little movie"" based on its budget and star power. But, it tells a small and simple story. There are problems. Fridging for instance. Or the existence of Michael Sheen in this movie (what was he trying to do). But, overall, this is an enjoyable picture. If bad reviews have kept you away from it, you should give it a chance."
378,"Personally as someone who thought the Eddie Murphy Dolittle films were ok and not something to write home about, this is a step up especially to keep kids entertained, RDJ needs to choose a accent and stick with it though. As a Brit myself it came across as a weird attempt at welsh and the queen's English (that posh accent). In fact I feel if RDJ had stuck with the queen's English and not attempting Welsh (I hope that's what he was attempting) the film would be worth 10 stars.I have 3 kids between 11&1 and all 3 sat quietly and watched the whole film nicely, they laughed out loud at the bagpipe scene and they thoroughly enjoyed the entire film which is what gives this film it's 9 star rating from myself. It's a film for kids and it does what it says. As a adult I enjoyed it despite the messiness of the scenes.Antonio Banderas is also great in this film and I have no issues with his scenes at all, in fact it was distantly reminiscent of his Zorro days.I don't know how to portray the film in words but if you watch it you'll know what I mean (I hope) when I say that it feels mushed together, rushed and just completely disorganized.The CGI is amazing and the A-Listers who voiced the animals did amazing jobs and infact I was surprised (in a pleasant to way) see who some of the voices belonged to.
Long story short RDJ needs to pick a accent and stick with it, messy and rushed feeling throughout entire film but great for target audience (kids) and great for adults too if you're not a movie snob and sometimes just want to be entertained."
379,I have a 5 year old son. He is happy with Dolittle ... this movie is just for that audience ... no more.
380,"The animal talking doctor has become a recluse because he has lost the love of his life and (probably) because no one can stomach his thick Welsh accent.He is forced from his solitude as the Queen of England is ill and can only be saved by a mythical fruit that exists on a hidden island.
So off we go with a young boy in towThere is everything a young kid could want in this film: exotic locations, cannon battles, sword fights, hidden treasure.
Not to mention all the animal antics.
The animals have quirky, uncomplicated characters you can get behind: i.e a nervous gorilla or a moody Ostrich.Animals fart and poo and squash people and all the capers you would expect children to find amusing.It doesn't try to be too clever, is very light hearted and has quite a classic feel about it.As an adult I didn't particularity enjoy this but this is clearly not meant for me.If you need something to keep a child or two quiet for a few hours then I can't see how you could possibly go wrong with this."
381,"Kids will probably love this film, but most of the adults may find it too absurd. It has talking animals, childish humour with nice costumes and an easy to follow plot. But beside that, there are so many issues with this film. I get that Dolittle has a gift that allows him to speak to animals, but how do the animals speak to each other - do they all share in his power? At the end, ""Dolittle"" is colorful on the outside, but at the inside it's a struggle from start to finish.Rating: 5"
382,"After the loss of his wife, Dr dolittle locks himself in solitide along with his peculiar animals who he can talk with in their language. This movie is about adventure, loss of loved one, emotional stress and how to go ahead with your life. Funny with simple plot. Can he overcome his loss and move on with his life and share his incredible gift for the welfare of society?"
383,"A lot of people are giving this hate but it isnt as bad as people say it is, read on to find out why.Acting:
The cast was great and the acting from everyone was decent. Their characters were relatively simple but wholesome. I however didnt like RDJ's accent throughout as I could hardly understand him 1/3 of the film.Cinematography/cgi:
Wow I was blown away and the amazing cgi and special affects this had. Truly up there with the new planet of the apes and avatar. One of the highlights of this film was the CGI. The Camera shots and everything in between were also extremely high quality.Story:
Very PG and safe story that makes for a pretty simple storyline. I enjoyed the relationships between characters, humans and animals. This film is very much for kids or a family film so I would rate it for what it is. If not for the cast, cgi and character relations this would of definitely been a stinker for the story alone. But it's in no way a terrible story, just plain.Summary:
I think people are being too harsh on this film. In my opinion it was just above being okay. It had a lot of things going for it and is no way a bad film. If you like kids films or want something to show your kids with amazing CGI then this will be a good watch for you."
384,"First of all - THIS IS A KIDS MOVIE!!!!!
I'm not sure where all the hate is coming from. I thought this movie was really good. Don't Expect an Eddie Murphy type Dolittle, expect a fun adventure movie FOR KIDS!!! all these self proclaimed movie critics on here ripping this movie apart seriously need to get a sense of humour. Its not supposed to be serious.
To anyone who has said ""he had a silly voice"" = he's Welsh. He is supposed to sound like that. As a Welsh person myself, I think he did a very good job at the accent. I suggest people avoid the negativity on here and watch it for yourself.
7/10"
385,"To everyone saying ""its for kids"".This movie is a reimagining of a classic comedy loved by children who are now adults. When this is the case, those nostalgic adults are the ones who will be the most enthused to see what modern technology and the evolution of filmmaking can offer to enhance a childhood memory.I also don't believe that a movie being for kids is an excuse for poor filmmaking. They spent $185 million on this movie. Had a fantastic cast, modern technology and raw talent at their disposal, yet there are clear and totally avoidable issues riddled throughout. Why?There are many kids movies that might not be interesting to adults, but are still recognizable as good productions.There are 3 key areas that bothered me the most.The script:
This is where the film fell completely flat. The dialogue was weak to say the least. There was no witty or clever discord. No deep or meaningful spoken moments. Messaging and exposition were carried out in the most basic of ways. No thought was put into differentiating each character's tone-of-voice. About 90% of the animals had identical personalities. If you were to read a transcript without the names of each character, you wouldn't know who said what. Narratively, it approached incoherent territory. Whether that was due to the lack of creativity, or just the incessant and unnecessary clutter that crowded the story, we'll never know.Character development:
RDJ is a fantastic actor. Few can measure up to his natural charm and charisma and yet the execution of such a beloved character - Dolittle - was bland and uninspiring. The underwhelmingly soft-spoken vet with the inconsistent Welsh (?) accent totally lacked the appropriate impact that a main character of this calibre should have.There was zero character development in any of the animals which was a shame. They were used as props. Mouth peices for meaningless chit chat that can only be described as filler content. There was a missed opportunity to create some really strong and interesting characters, which not only would have been far more entertaining, but would have given the film some longevity. Overall, a waste of a talented cast.The editing:
There are several scenes where shots are uncomfortably long. Particularly in moments of dialogue. The weird split second intervals between shots make the flow of conversations seem unnatural and highlight the fact that there was a struggle marrying the CGI animals to the human interactions.There are moments of action where characters seem to move around in a way that can only be made possible by instant teleportation. The animal is here one second, and in the very next shot, in a completely different spot. Lazy continuity. Was the issue in the storyboard? Was there a lack of communication between the cinematographers and the animators? Was it just a lack of attention to detail? Again, who knows.In conclusion, the film missed the mark. There was so much potential to create something absolutely captivating which was abandoned in favour of anxiety-inducing visual chaos and thoughtless slapstick.I do wonder why it went so wrong, all things considered. From where I'm standing, it seems that there may have been too many cooks in the kitchen. Overall, another remake that will fade into irrelevance faster than it took me to write this review."
386,I really don't understand why people are hating on this movie it is a very good movie has good humor and of course it's made for a younger audience a guy who talks to animals. are you expecting a grown-up movie?.It's not a 10 to me because of the ending(i wanted him to marry the queen) and the death of his wife and the sissy boy.
387,"Ok, this is not an artsy movie. It won't win an Oscar, maybe not for everyone. Who cares? This is a fun movie. The animation is great, the story is ok and the happy ending is there. Downey is a decent Doolittle. Don't analyze, just go with it and enjoy."
388,"""Dolittle"" is an Adventure - Comedy movie in which we watch a physician who has the ability of talking to animals going on a new adventure to find a legendary island with the help of his crew and a young boy.I enjoyed watching this movie but I believe that it didn't reach its potential or I had high expectations from it. I liked the interpretation of Robert Downey Jr. who played as Dr. John Dolittle and it was something extremely different than his previous roles. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Harry Collett's who played as Tommy Stubbins and he was very good at it. The direction which was made by Stephen Gaghan it was interesting but nothing more than this.Finally, I have to say that ""Dolittle"" is a good average movie to spend your time with but don't have high expectations from it because you are going to be let down by it."
389,"With the words of Mark Kermode's review ringing in my ears (""It's shockingly poor... and that's the same in any language"") I was bracing myself when I went to see this latest incarnation of Hugh Lofting's famous animal-chatting character. And I have to agree that it is a shocking mess of a film, given $175 million was poured into this thing. But, and I say this cautiously without first-hand empirical evidence, I *think* this is a movie that kids in the 6 to 10 age range might fall in love with.Doctor Doolittle (Robert Downey Jnr) - famed animal doctor, with the unique ability to communicate with any animal - is now holed up in his animal sanctuary, a recluse. His beloved wife - adventurer Lily - was lost at sea (in a cartoon sequence that could have just used the same clip from ""Frozen""). He's lost the will to practice; and almost lost the will to live.Impinging on his morose life come two humans: Tommy Stubbings (Harry Collett), a reluctant hunter with a wounded squirrel, and Lady Rose (Carmel Laniado), daughter of the Queen of England. (We'll quietly ignore the coincidence that, after what looks like several years of mourning, these two independently pitch up at Chez Doolittle within ten minutes of each other!).For the Queen (the omnipresent Jessie Buckley) is dying, and noone (other than us viewers, let in on the deal) suspect foul play might be at work in the form of Lord Thomas Badgley (the ever-reliable Jim Broadbent) and the Queen's old leech-loving doctor Blair Müdfly (a moustache-twiddling Michael Sheen).Doolittle must engage in a perilous journey to find the only cure that will save both the Queen and his animal sanctuary - the fruit of the tree on a missing island that his long lost love was searching for.Let's start with the most obvious point first up. Robert Downey Jnr's Welsh accent is quite the most terrible, most preposterous, most unintelligible, most offensive (to the Welsh) attempt at an accent in a mainstream film in movie history. And that's really saying something when you have Laurence Olivier's Jewish father from ""The Jazz Singer"" and Russell Crowe's English cum Irish cum Scottish cum Yugoslavian ""Robin Hood"" in the list. Why? Just why? Was it to distance this version from Rex Harrison's? (Since most younger movie goers will be going ""Rex who?"" at this point, this seems unlikely). It's a wholly curious decision.It turns RDj's presence in the movie from being an asset to a liability.The movie has had a tortuous history. Filmed in 2018 at enormous expense, the film completely bombed at test screenings so they brought in more script writers to make it funnier and did extensive additional filming.I actually disagree with the general view that the film is unfunny. For there are a few points in the movie where I laughed out loud. A fly's miraculous, if temporary, escape was one such moment. The duck laying an egg in fright, another.However, these seem to stand out starkly in isolation as 'the funny bits they inserted'. Much of the rest of the movie's comedy falls painfully flat.In terms of the acting, there are the obvious visual talents on show of Michael Sheen (doing a great English accent for a Welshman.... #irony), Jim Broadbent, Jessie Buckley, Joanna Page (blink and you'll miss her) and Antonio Banderas, as the swashbuckling pirate king cum father-in-law.But the end titles are an amazing array of ""Ah!"" moments as the vocal performances are revealed: Emma Thompson as the parrot; Rami Malek as the gorilla; John Cena as the polar bear; Kumail Nanjiani at the ostrich; Octavia Spencer at the duck; Tom Holland as the dog; Selena Gomez as the giraffe; Marion Cotillade as the fox, Frances de la Tour as a flatulent dragon and Ralph Fiennes as an evil tiger with mummy issues. It's a gift for future contestants on ""Pointless""!There are a lot of poe-faced critics throwing brick-bats at this movie, and to a degree it's deserved. They lavished $175 million on it, and it looked like it was going to be a thumping loss. (However, against all the odds, at the time of writing it has grossed north of $184 million. And it only opened yesterday in China. So although not stellar in the world of blockbuster movies it's not going to be a studio-killer like ""Heaven's Gate"").And I suspect there's a good reason for that latent salvation. I think kids are loving this movie, driving repeat viewings and unexpected word of mouth. It is certainly a family friendly experience. There are no truly terrifying scenes that will haunt young children. A dragon-induced death, not seen on screen, is - notwithstanding the intro Frozen-esque cartoon sequence - the only obvious one in the movie and is (as above) played for laughs. There are fantastical sets and landscapes. Performing whales. A happy-ending (albeit not the one I was cynically expecting). And an extended dragon-farting scene, and what kids are not going to love that!!Directed by Stephen Gaghan (""Syriana"", but better known as a writer than a director) it's a jumbled messy bear of a movie but is in no way an unpleasant watch. I would take a grandkid along to watch this again. It even has some nuggets of gold hidden within its matted coat.As this is primarily one for the kids, I'm giving the movie two ratings: 4/10 for adults and 8/10 for kids... the IMDB is the mean of these.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook. Thanks)."
390,"I just got out of Dolittle with my nephew.This is a mess of a movie. It fails on so many levels, this will probably end up on a lot of Worst Of The Year lists. I applaud them for what they were aiming for, they were trying to be whimsical and magical, but it just does not work!! As for the ending really has to be seen to be believed.There were some kids sat directly in front of me, aged between 4-10 and they really enjoyed it. They laughed when the were supposed to, got excited at certain parts and had a good time. Seeing them get a kick out of it, was more entertaining than the movie itself. Based on that, kid's will get a kick out of it and I guess I am not the target audience.Robert Downey Jr is one of the most charismatic men in Hollywood right now, but he is is rather subdued here. I see why they used so little of his dialogue in the trailers as his accent is jarring and truthfully a lot of it looked like the type of ADR found in a Steven Seagal movie.Antonio Banderas is ok, but Michael Sheen is awful as the villain. The voice actors are all fine, but like last years The Lion King nobody stood out."
391,Kids and adults had a laugh. Animals talking were great.
392,"I thought it was a fun movie, mainly saw it for Selena Gomez. Who only have a few lines. It was cute and a good time. However some things seemed a little too cheesy and strange."
393,"I'm guessing that most of the bad reviews are from people without families, as our lot loved it. Not a classic by any stretch, but an enjoyable couple of hours for the kids. (For you too, if you allow it)"
394,A good family film but not sure about that Welsh accent - but I did get used to it. Not an Award winning film but good to watch with the family and did make me laugh.
395,"As a stand alone children's film, it's an ideal film to take them to in the half term holidays for a bit of comedy, action and adventure. Don't even begin to compare it to the book by Hugh Lofting or the 1967 Doctor Dolittle, starring Rex Harrison, that was a delightful cinematic extravaganza that still impresses me to this day.
This Doolittle has an unnusual Welsh accent, a broken heart and is a recluse, surrounded only by his menagerie of animal friends, who he can converse with.
Enter a young lad, a Queen's young lady in waiting and a Royal Quest and there you have the start of a long adventure, fraught with danger on the high seas and comic capers from the animals.
It's funny, it's exciting and it's 1hr 41mins of pure entertainment for children and adults alike. Go see it and make up your own mind.👍🏼😀"
396,"This was a lot of fun, and a lot different that the original and a lot more different than the 2010 version.
Robert Downey Jr played this role superbly, and the supporting cast (of humans) were also fun to watch. The CGI and special effects were done well and the story overall kept my interest from the very start of the movie.
And I am saying this as a grown adult male who watched with only my wife.I will say it felt a little rushed near the end, but overall this was a great and unique watch!PS...So glad to see a movie with a quirky main character that doesn't star Johnny Depp and his one trick pony act!
Just my personal opinion."
397,"If you see a review that gives it 1 star, you have to question the credibility of the reviewer. It's not going to be a classic in years to come but an entertaining yarn none the less. The weirdest part of the film is Robert Downey jr accent. Cannot decide if he is English, Scottish or Welsh."
398,"No meaningful story, everything is on fast forward and much of it makes no sense
The animals have great personalities but the movies lacks in every other aspect in my optinion"
399,"The Movie is good and not bad at all but I expect more and it kinda bored me in the middle of the movie, but still I don't hate it and I think kids will love this, because it contain of animals fun to watch."
400,Most kids movies these days an adult can sit through and be entertained as well. Not this one. It's lousy. Grab a beer and let your 13 year old suffer through it while watching the 6 year olds.
401,"This movie is overall average so you can go with family and watch it no problem. I wouldn't say you should skip it, but I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it either.The good bits:
First of all, the animal characters are all lovely. After all who doesn't love talking, witty animals? The scenery was also quite fitting for the story. The plot is fairly predictable but doesn't particularly disappoint. There are a lot of comedy scenes and the squirrel specially was very dramatic in a funny way, which I loved.The bad bits:
There is great animation in many scenes but sloppy in many other scenes. You can clearly notice it. It feels like watching the first Godzilla movie when technology wasn't that advanced. I think we have definitely gotten used to better animation so it was bit of an eyesore. Like I said the plot is fairly predictable, so if you are a teen/adult you will find the story itself to be pretty dull and repetitive. The human characters are mostly forgettable leaving very little impact, and even Robert left much to be desired.The absolute worst:
I couldn't stand the way the dialogues were being spoken. A lot of grunting and intangible dialogue, I thought it was just me who was having a hard time with do little but others in the group complained of the same thing. I think trying to add so much ""British"" touch definitely backfired as it doesn't appeal much to the average viewer. The animals were definitely way better in this regard.Favourite characters: definitely the parrot and the polar bearOverall enjoyment: I went with my eyes closed because I didn't read any reviews or synopsis beforehand so I didn't expect a lot but it was still fairly average. Overall enjoyable and pretty forgettable. You can watch this movie for a fun day out with family or just to watch something relaxing."
402,This is a nice lighthearted family movie. I heard a lot of negative things about this movie before going to see it in theaters. I wasn't expecting much but I really enjoyed it. The CGI can be questionable at times but overall I think it is a good movie to watch with your family. What my family says about these kinds of movies is that it's a rental (not worth seeing on the big screen).
403,"It's a good kids film, but:1. Half baked CGI that looked cartoony at best and downright insulting at worst
2. Poor script, didn't get me invested in any way. It was just there to fill in the silence, nothing more.
3. While the idea of story was good, storytelling itself wasn't at all. That includes a mixture of rushed sequences, poor camera work, too many needless cuts, movement on screen way to fast for a kid to track and so on.. Whoever directed this did a poor job. Almost laughable at times.
4. Robert's accent was terrible, I don't know who forced him to do that. They should've just made him do the British accent, cause he does a much better job at it.
5. Shots that have received CGI treatment are somehow worse than those where there isn't CGI at all - couldn't have they at least maintained the quality throughout?
Idk what went wrong here, but it looks like a movie that had good ideas, and that somehow ended as a half baked potato that honestly doesn't even deserve a 6/10. I'm kind of upset, really hoped that if nothing else, Downey would carry it.. but no - he was awful too."
404,"Not very good. much preferred Eddie Murphy in Dr Dolittle. And as for Robert Downey Jr's accent, appalling!! Thought it was a very bad Scottish accent initially, had to Google what it was meant to be!!"
405,"It's a movie that is nothing special. Except that it brings back the idea of the Rex Harrison movie from the 60's. Which, frankly they should do more of. Make movies that are closer to the books they come from, instead of trying to modernize them.Would I watch this again? Probably not. Would I recommend it to families as a fun film? Yep."
406,"It's an enjoyable film for all the ages. Although I'm not a kiddo anymore, I still like to watch these kind of movies. Has entertainment all the way till the end, filled with laughter and pure fun. Suitable for simply anybody who hasn't lost his/her sense of humor yet :)."
407,Not bad but not that good fun with family kinda boring for adults fun for kids judge it for your self
408,"At first, I had no idea who Dolittle was, but the movie made me understand more and is easy to follow. Awesome!"
409,"Dolittle is fine. It has talking animals, and Robert Downey Jr. tries his hardest with a Welsh(?) accent, but in the end the movie is another soulless reboot. The film doesn't capture the same childish whimsy that the original did, nor the humor of the Eddie Murphy reboot. It tries to merge the tone of the two and fails, resulting in a film that is sure to appeal to children but which they will forget within a week."
410,"I am not very picky when going to movies. Most movies entertain me. This one did not. I couldn't wait for it to be over. If I had any self respect, I would have left mid movie. If you have young kids, maybe you could suck it up and take your kids to see this. They might enjoy it, but you will not."
411,"I am of pensionable age so my views on what is a movie meant for kids shouldnt deter families from forming their own opinion on this movie.
What was a real deal breaker for me was Robert Downey in a case of the worst miscasting in a film I have ever seen. As soon as he opened his mouth I groaned in disbelief. Atrociously fake English accent meant that his dialogue is virtually incomprehensible for most of the movie. Makers of this movie should have added English subtitles each time Dolittle/Downey opened his mouth. Only actor who stands out in this clunker is Antonio Banderas."
412,"Man oh Man! What did I just see? A film and its somehow unique concept that has been successful in the past ruined and demolished by garbage execution in pure Amateurish hands. I don't remember much about the previous films but I do remember them to be a lot more funnier and enjoyable.On the other side, This one is absolutely not. Perhaps it would be suitable only for under 8 Children but not for the grown ups or even teens. There's nothing in the name of character build up! The characters here just moves in all of a sudden and start their respective journeys without their whereabouts! And their conclusions never really gives us something to cheer for them! So boring! The Dialogues try to make comedic moment every now and then but miserably fails most of the time. Cinematography and CGI department wasn't that bad but what could they do if the presentation itself is utter trash? Background score sounded decent but again what's in it for? Wasted once again.Let's come to the performances now. I love Robert Downey Jr. His charismatic presence on the screen is something only few people possesses! Yet he can't save this film on his own. I indeed feel pity for him. His acting here looked overdramatic mostly and what's with that weird accent? That sounds horrible. Downey should have played the character like he usually plays the others! You don't need to be geographically correct all the times! The boy who plays stubbins is underwhelming. His character never really got the chance to devolope! Same for the other non human characters too. They had promising traits to create some memorable altercations but again it's duly wasted by the sheer dumbness the plot portrays.As a whole it's a Messy, disjointed Edition of dolittle that turns even worse with sloppy editing and poorer execution in lesser experienced hands. This is a movie that is never meant to happen!
Skip this for your own good."
413,"I spent the whole movie trying to work out what accent RDJ was speaking in. I heard irish, scottish and welsh. Horrible movie"
414,That is an experience I never wanted to go through again.
415,I think he isn't suitable for this show. Wrong choice of actor that make the show boring and dull.
416,"I think critics were expecting an iron man movie since robert downey was the actor. Its an entertainer like a fairy tale. Keep your logic outside the movie hall, grab a popcorn and watch with your family and kids. Movie will entertain you."
417,"Where is Eddie Murphy?....This is the same as with the Mummy putting Tom Cruise in it.
Capitalizing the title of a Film with a different story and actor..."
418,This movie was not the best idea for RDJ.. the movie was now funny it was rather annoying for me.. it just wasnt interesting at all...
419,"Best movie of 2020
creativity 10/10
special effects 10/10
dialogue 10/10"
420,"I really enjoyed watching it. Made me laugh a lot. I don't know why the ""critics"" didn't appreciate the humor in it (maybe because they don't know humor AT ALL). Also, why they had a problem with how the director/rdj interpreted the voyage of dolittle. Well all I can say is their ideas came out unique and fun to watch! If one gets the humor and idea of it all. But if not, well, sucks to be you."
421,Robert Downey jr's British accent needed subtitles it was so bad. Story was lame and jokes old and stale. CGI was good.
422,I was a bit disappointed as I love Robert Downey Jr. this movie was a bit silly. He can be very funny and serious as well but this movie was a bit immature even though I just Disney cartoons and movies but I was expecting a little more. He should have stayed at Tony Stark/Iron Man! He was the absolute best fit and still could have done other movies in the side.
423,I don't understand the poor rating for this movie. I'm glad I didn't search the rating before watching it.The colours in this movie is beautiful. The storyline is definitely far fetched but so is the idea of a human speaking to animals so what do you expect?The one liner jokes had my husband and I laughing whereas usually I'm laughing by myself so that says something too.Good movie to watch with young kids 5-10 ish.Those are the people who should be adding the reviews!
424,"I thought that it was so stupid, a kit spends time with Dolittle and is all of the sudden able to understand the animals. I always thought, well from the first two Dolittle, that is was a give and not a skill. Storytelling was good until the kid started to understand the animal in matter of days. It was like really?"
425,"Nice film. It feel so good. This is so fantasy, all animals can talk."
426,"I love this movie so much for many reasons. Great family adventure movie. Being someone who has experienced a great loss, I could so relate to him wanting everyone to be away. I have 5 fur kids now, and they really relate in odd ways. But yes getting back to the adventure of life is important, and you have to go on and get back to the things you love. Forever a fan!"
427,"'Dolittle' is such an excitement to watch. We recommend it for all ages, but we'd advise ages sixes or under should view it with a parent or guardian.
Connie says, ""I loved all the lifelike animals, especially the mythical kind.""
We were excited by the scene where the main characters hopped on a pirate's ship; especially how they collaborated with the whale to get the job done. We also very much enjoyed the unexpected twist at the end. If you get the chance, see 'Dolittle' in cinemas, now!"
428,"RD Jr. makes for a great Doctor Dolittle. CGI animals and their corresponding dialogs are hilarious. The expressions on the critter's and animal's faces match their dialog and emotions.This a funny, adventure family movie at its best. Don't let the movie ""critics"" downplay this movie.Wonderful and amazing settings, the bad guys are classic villains and the heroes come through in the end.Take the family, take the kid in you.....see this movie."
429,"This is a kids movie and should be reviewed as such.My 14-year-old loved it, and I didn't fall asleep like I do trying to watch most films. Plenty of comedy, fart jokes and mild peril to keep anyone from 5-15 interested.Sure, it's a flimsy plot and a really weird Welsh accent, but otherwise it's a perfectly nice way to spend a couple of hours with your kids."
430,"Better than expected, an easy light hearted watch for kids."
431,Light hearted feel good fun and visually awesome. I enjoyed the laid back movie.
432,"Ok movie, RDJ is channeling Sherlock. Cant tell if he was trying to speak British ir Scottish."
433,"Having only seen bits & pieces of the original franchise which since went down the cheap, Straight-To-DVD, cash in route. But know of the films concept all the way.Now this film is a remake, this time with a white actor, Robert Downey Jr. The films plot follows a man who can talk to animals, pretty much like the original films. But the plot here is that the Doctor is sent on a mission to save the queen of Britain by finding an antidote, while his rivals at Buckingham Palace don't want that to happen due to some dark revelation.The films plot while simple, was pretty flat & dull. There wasn't enough emphasis on the narrative which made the story more boring than it actually was, even though it was simple. I also felt the pirate/century theme wasn't appealing. The film could've been set in modern times & would've been a better fit if you ask me.Some negative reviews point to the jokes & run time. 1. The film is 1 hour & 33 minutes. Not long if you ask me. And 2. Try to remember IT'S A KIDS FILM! Of course there's going to be toilet humour & dumb, stupid, cheesy jokes. What do you expect? I thought the jokes were suiting to the film.Overall it's an ok watch. Don't expect too much & you might enjoy it. 5/10"
434,"The good: Erm...nothing! Not even RDJ can save this film from sinking.The bad: RDJ's confusing Welsh accent. The animal CGI, nearly as bad as 1995 Jumanji. Only 90mins long yet somehow manages to feel both rushed and boring!
You know something is wrong with a film when the biggest laugh comes from a fart joke!The bottom line: Don't waste your time or money going to see this. Children might find it funny purely because of the talking animals, but adults will be thoroughly bored, i know i was after 30 mins."
435,"A pleasant family film. But not a remarkable movie moment
I liked the gorilla and Downey played the role well however I didn't come out feeling that I had been in a magical Dolittle world
A good choice if you want charm without depth.
Maybe for a 6-11 year old audience and parents
Enjoy it. But don't expect an X Factor experience."
436,I quite liked the movie. I had laughed quite a few times. This would be a movie i would recommend to families with younger kids. The voices were a little weird at some times. Overall this is still a decent movie therefore i gave it 7/10
437,Love the character of Dr. Doolittle but it just didn't work well in this movie. Lines that you know are meant to be funny were met with dead silence unfortunately. If you like special effects then you'll have a bit to see in this movie but don't expect to fall in love with it and say you can't wait to see it again. Just didn't impress me in the end.
438,I don't get why some think this is an awful movie. I found it very charming. If you love Robert Downey Jr. and Animals..how can you go wrong. :)
439,Family friendly fun once you get used to RDJ's accent. Just right for a wet Saturday afternoon's viewing. Funny for kids and adults alike.
440,"Dolittle is a mild and smooth story telling. If you had experience of granny stories, then you would love it."
441,"Believe me... I went into it disappointed as it wasn't the 1970's version but I kept an open mind. I was glad I did because once you get over the weird accent RDJ has, its worth the money to see it. The animals quickly get into your heart and you find yourself rooting them on during their adventure.Its a true movie about love, loss and having true friends to remind you who you truly are and why you should remain as you are and change for no one... And to live life to the fullest..."
442,"Given the skill level of all assembled, the story line simple, this was far below their skill level and yet for the family will prove to be a nice pass time.."
443,"Much better than I expected. I was waiting for a special event to start, so decided to see this to pass the time. I really enjoyed it. No serious, big Oscar winner.....but....just good fun..."
444,"I love the movie, simple Story and very fun also good for family. I watch today and i laughed alot with my niece. Good job for robert downey and all the cast. And i never thought rami malek,john cena,tom holland included in this movie."
445,"Ok, this is not a good movie. The locations seems to be in a magical land, but everyone is ordinary. Dolittle is a fictional character that can talk to animals but there is no explanation how or why does he have that ability. The two villains, including the main one, laks the look of evil, intimidation, and threatening, and show no competition at all with the main character. The animals were supposed to play a big role and they still failed. It's completely acceptable that they have unique characteristics, but they also need to respond to their nature, Instead they have a polar bear that doesn't like the cold, a parrot that acts like she's the one paying the rent, and an insecure gorilla that doesn't know it's own strength. And there's the dog, the only domestic animal that should always be next to the owner (friend), instead of joining the crew and taking the side with the main character it's left away to protect a sleeping beauty in a room where the villain is always next to the victim. At least use a strong animal in case everything goes wrong to protect!. A poker face princess that acts like she's the queen herself but for some reason doesn't mind to interact with ordinary boys. The boy is useless in the movie with no important and and exciting parts and that was a huge surprise. The cgi tiger and other animals looks cartoonish but feels like it was on purpose. Iron man acting was good but I feel that his character Dolittle deserved to be more epic and unstoppable like a real hero, instead we got an antisocial homeless looking guy that likes to fall into defeat. There was a group of people that walked away during the movie and never came back. So my feedback is to watch the movie with no expectations because you won't have a discussion about it at the end, just kill time with a date or a kid for 2 hours and don't look back."
446,"Considering it's a character from children's books, I must say ""Dolittle"" follows the same line and ends up being a totally enjoyable film. It isn't the eighth wonder of the world but it makes you laugh a lot and have a good time. Yes, I recommend to go and see it."
447,Loved it! The animals looked so real. Bravo on the special effects.
448,For all ages the story too straight forward and simple to understand. Not many people like it. But if you casual audience this movie must be good for you.
449,"The trailer had a bit of a sadness too it, so I wasn't sure if I would enjoy it. But I ended up loving it. It was fun to watch."
450,It's a family movie not meant for the oscars so don't expect it to be. Go and enjoy the ride and come out with a smile on your face.Really enjoyed this so much more than I expected to. Yes Roberts' accent was a tad annoying but the movie was such fun and we all need a bit of that in our lives. The visuals were good and the gags had me really laughing. Wasn't stupid comedy i thought.
451,"After reading reviews I went in expecting it not to be so good. To my surprise it was a joyful, fun, family movie. Again to my surprise critics lately have been getting it all wrong. At this point I recommend everyone to watch any movie before they read all the negative reviews. Unless it's a ""Marvel movie"" I don't think anyone give a decent good review nowadays."
452,"Boring, uninspired and just terrible in the general sense."
453,"Another proof that just because you were good in a Marvel movie doesn't mean you'll make good movies. Recently The Russo Brothers made a movie called 21 Bridges which I was quite excited about, after watching it I realized these guys may be great in general but if Kevin Fiege isn't looking after their every move they may fail at making a good movie.
Dolittle suffers from the same curse. A movie marketed on Robert's name in which Robert is it's worst part. Not going into any spoilers, the thing the bugged me the most is the utter lack of innovation in this movie and it's protagonist. This feels more like a Cable TV Christmas movie than an actually Hollywood Blockbuster. For that matter, it isn't even good at being an enjoyable movie. This was a failed attempt at reigniting the Tony Stark charmed instead of a decent adventure movie,"
454,I hate talking animals and Actors who talk to animals. Iron Man do need another billion dollars to line your greedy pockets? F. U. Iron Man.
455,If you wanna know where iron man goes to heaven see movie best one yet for kids and family
456,Iron man is iron man. RD doesN't fit to an old english man. At some point you will need subtitle to understand what he's saying
457,"Here's my review of Dolittle or what I'd like to call Disney's attempt at recreating pirates of the Caribbean . The movie stars Robert Downey Jr as Dr Dolittle who forcefully tries to do a Jack sparrow with a Scottish accent cause he was paid a lot to do so. If you know the og Dr Dolittle movies , you very well know that he can talk to animals. And I liked some of the cgi animals and their voice acting , esp the dog voiced by Tom Holland and the polar bear voiced by John Cena . And they were funny at times . But the overall humour in this movie is just bad ! It's just forced too much from fart jokes to weird imitations. There's a kid in this movie who wants to be Dolittle's assistant and he looks like and probably is the same age as Tom Holland , then why didn't the studio cast him as the apprentice and let someone else be the dog ??! , they could've atleast gained a larger audience with the Spidey - iron Man chemistry , but nope ! They had to make him voice the dog. A lot of the side characters are annoying and it's shot like a direct to TV movie. In the end Dolittle is a cgi blunder of a reboot that tries too hard to be a fun swashbuckler ."
458,"If you like Disney movies, example: Around the World in 80 Days from 2004 etc.You will love this.If you expect Robert d.j. to take over where Eddie Murphy left, then you will be dissapointed.."
459,I don't understand how this movie isn't doing well in the box office! Robert Downey Jr does an amazing job as well as the rest of the cast. I would recommend this movie to everyone
460,"Nothing special
Animals looks bad , bad cinematography, overall 0/10 but because of Robert Downey Jr its 2/10"
461,"Poor movie about a whiny old man who is mostly concerned about his ego. A movie in 2020 shouldn't fail on giving strong roles to female actresses..
As a viewer you get the feeling you are thrown 30 years back when it comes to equality and mindset of characters.
We shouldn't give our children this old patriarchy way of seeing the world!"
462,Robert Downey Jr's first outing since endgame as he portrays Dr dolittle. A solid children's film that unfortunately has stale jokes and plots mounded together. Not bad as I enjoyed it.5/10
463,It was OK. Nothing special. I took my daughter as I had free movie tickets. I think if I had to pay for admission I would be a little harsher. Robert Downey is a great actor but there was nothing that stands out here except his bad accent. The CG animals was the best part. I would recommend waiting for the DVD.
464,We liked it! RDJ does a great job playing off a green screen for 90 min. Great story well told. It was fun and kids would love it. Not sure why this wasn't a big hit.
465,"An absolute great movie for the family. First it saw in the theater with 8yr old granddaughter. In my 58 years of living. This is one of only a handful of movies. That I've been to, that the entire (FULL) theater applauded afterwards. Why the critic's hated it is beyond me. Oh that's right, they're critic's."
466,"Although it does manage to be fairly entertaining, Dolittle fails on telling its story straight, and proving to be anything but a CGI cash grab for kids and families alike. The acting in the film is often overdramatic, or simply problematic, and in return is one of the reasons why the film seems lazily contrived. Robert Downey Jr. goes all out in the film, although it seems that his lost character is even more lost in his overdone performance, with his accent changing from time to time, and his performance feeling more silly than humorous, or emotional. All other voice performances are also quite bland, and even other big celebrities that get a chance to shine as something other than an animal, are quite silly to watch. The film has a problem with its story and sticking to all many contrived parts of it. The plot seems to go all over the place, and it feels more like a combination of episodes woven together with a thread than a true complete film. Even more so, the script and dialogue is full of cliches and painfully corny remarks, that vary on deeply unfunny to deeply stupid. The CGI used on the animal seems ridiculously overdone, with the effects sticking out like a sore thumb, rather than actually providing the enjoyment is so desperately trying to seek in the audience. The film can be entertaining, and is consistently watchable throughout, but more often than not, it is simply a trainwreck through and through. The most disappointing part of Dolittle, is not its lazy plotline or its overacted performances, but its sense of potential throughout by its nature, and its constant wrong turn on every decision it decided to make. In the end, Dolittle is a mess. It's full of problematic plot issues, performances, and it's only sense of value is its broad sense of entertainment, which it somehow manages to be, despite its so many obvious issues.
My Rating: 3/10"
467,Dolittle is enjoyable family movie . It doesn't deserve this bad reviews .
468,I came out of the cinema with a big smile on my face. It's a fun movie. Very colourful and visually imaginative with plenty of laughs. If you and your kids love animals this is for you.
469,Nowdays good movies get rated lower than the bad movies . Smh this movie was not bad but deserve to be rated 7/10
470,"So many things wrong with this, namely RDJ's ambiguous ""British"" accent. I felt he was imitating Lord Petr Baelish. Regardless, this film needed less arbitrary plot lines and desperately required an extra hour of screen time to elaborate on the majority of the storylines introduced. I'm sure if you have children they will enjoy the film, as that is the target audience. I feel the film rushed too many scenes that would have actually been enjoyable to watch in favour of non-important dialogue."
471,"You know what, yes it's a little disjointed but if you don't take yourself too seriously and are ready for a family film then this is perfect.
Also, Robert Downey Jr does a pretty good welsh accent (considering most can't do even a passable one) plus Michael Sheen was great at being a classic baddie.
CGI was good and cast were great.Biggest shout out to the squirrel. Made me laugh lots (although the fly gag was the best)"
472,"As a family movie its not bad but why rdj was speaking so weird, really put u off."
473,"Seen most of the Dr Dolittle films, and I'm afraid I found this boring and not really very funny, yeah it looks good and the effects are good, but as a lovable character it just doesn't work for me. Some kind of plot thrown in the mix but to be honest, I'd lost interest long before the end. I think younger children may struggle with it at the cinema if I'm honest. Wait for the video."
474,"As we were paying to go into the cinema we heard someone say the film had received some awful reviews (thanks for that!). Anyway as soon as it started the story unfolded fantastically. Wasn't too sure what Dolittle's accent was but realised that as he added 'boyo' a few times, it had to be Welsh. He was very difficult to understand and the accent changed from Oirish to Welsh throughout - but we just went with the flow. Michael Sheen brilliant as always, would have made a better Dolittle, we thought. But he was great as the doctor and despite being Welsh, with a beautiful accent, he was cast with an English accent (as most naughty men are in American films).Loved the special effects and scenery, many laugh out loud scenes - loved the dragon, gorilla and tiger. Lots of laughter in the cinema. Oh and wait until the very end.Negatives: the OTTl American accents of some of the animals - too Disney. The annoying voice of the dragonfly and the very annoying squirrel.Due to Dolittle's curly hair, odd coloured skin and Welsh accent, at times it seemed we were watching Tom Jones!"
475,"Poor Poor Poor...
A soft reboot....Accompanied with poor acting from both Robert and the rest of the cast.
Force-fed comedy humour which to be quite honest wasn't even funny!
Glad this bombed!
Be more imaginative Hollywood!!!!"
476,"A fantasy world filled with wonder, magic and colourful locales, but unfortunately, not a very good story and too much childish humour. Some of the acting is hit and miss, but most of the characters are good - Dolittle's eccentricity is a committed performance and the animals look and perform well, each with their own unique personalities. The slapstick humour sometimes works, but there's a lot of style over substance. The simple story doesn't really flow as it should, and the anachronistic language is unsettling."
477,"I saw Dolittle a couple days ago, I walked in worried because I knew I would be brutally honest if I didn't like it. But I really enjoyed it! There were some pacing issues and they over did it with the ""we are gonna die, no we aren't"" stuff but really it was great.
The cinema was partially packed which I was surprised about because I heard it was flopping. The kids were laughing at the scenes I didn't laugh at and I was laughing in other scenes so it was pretty well rounded enjoyment-wise. Actually started crying in one of the scenes which I wasn't expecting.
The film was beautiful, it looked amazing, but I feel like they didn't need all the star power they had, that would have been a big sinkhole for the budget because most of the animals only had a couple lines and even though I knew of all the voice actors in advance, watching the film I completely forgot they weren't just anyone voicing them, other than Tom Holland and Emma Thompson I don't think you needed stars to voice act.
The promotion for this film has been incredible, and I'm going to give this a 10/10 because IT'S A KIDS MOVIES AIMED AT KIDS but I still enjoyed it. People judging this movie seem to have forgotten that.
It's so unfortunate when an actor can't try new things because it's viewed as ""beneath them"" damn just let him have fun because I certainly did!"
478,It's basically just for fun and it was kind of fun. In a small way I wish they'd done a little more with it. But in a big way I'm glad they made it mostly pretty safe and wholesome even if not the best in that area. I enjoyed it and was not at all sorry for the money or the time.
479,"Dolittle was an alright film for me, because it's a remake to the original Dr. Dolittle. Robert Downey Jr. did pretty well playing Dolittle, and because I love Selena Gomez. She's in the movie and she plays the voice of a Giraffe. But I'm gonna have to go with Bad Boys for Life, because everybody loves Bad Boys."
480,"RDJ over acted, was over dubbed & was ultimately disappointing. Which is a pity as I'm a fan of his in general....And he looked far older than his movie father in law ...."
481,My wife and I saw this movie and had not much bad to say. Rami Malik did an amazing job so much so the wife did not recognize him. Unlike kumail nanjiani who can only do his voice. The welsh accent jr used was a nice touch but yes it is an hour and a half build up to a poor joke. So a solid meh
482,"I watched this film because of the cast of actors, decent family fantasy comedy but as I said the cast was the best part of the film"
483,"This movie is make me boring and make me sleepy . There's nothing special about the story line, however the CGI is good, with a little surprise plot twist endingYou can watch this movie when you feel bored cause this movie not worth to watch"
484,"In general, it's not an interesting premise and even the previous films have been awful. However, Robert Downey Jr (Dr. John Dolittle) brought another perspective that makes more sense like the eccentricity of his character. Besides, the CGI was much better. Now I can have a better mental picture of Dr. Dolittle."
485,"Don't know why this much hate for this feel good movie!
Maybe RDJ fans might not want him to do roles like this other than Iron Man.
But, as per me just skip the negative reviews and see the movie. You will enjoy for sure 👍"
486,Thought it was absolutely amazing. Super funny and wouldn't mind a follow up.
487,This movie doesn't deserve all the criticism it gets. It was a really fun kids movie with great imagery and some funny scenes. Iur kids loved it
488,"For me (as an adult) the film was too silly and too childish.
The CGI, however, was good."
489,"It was sad to see the scene in the trailer with the tiger, 'Hello Lunch.' Didn't make the movie. The CGI failed in a few spots and your suspension of disbelief will be sacrificed on a few occasions. The 'animals' and their human voices were good. I never even realized Tom Holland was a voice in the movie. Otherwise it was a fun entertaining movie.
One issue I had was RDJ's accent. It wasn't so much bad as it was more like he was whispering the whole movie. Even when he was yelling it was hard to understand him at times due to it. Otherwise overall a decent movie."
490,"I've always enjoyed the odd stinker, but a stinker only has charm if done on a low budget.This is self indulgence without relief. Starting with the elephant that refuses to leave the room, THAT accent! I had to google what it was supposed to be. I was guessing Geordie and even when I found out it was supposed to be Welsh I still couldn't place it. There is another Wales of which Robert Downie Jr is the sole inhabitant?The Dr Dolittle Books were set in the West Country but any accent would have been acceptable as long as it didn't leave the star so concentrating on getting It wrong that he Completely forgot who he was supposedly portraying.RDJ is not the only one too distracted to focus on the story. The writers couldn't remember what they were writing. The director must have been the entire shoot in the pub trying to drink their way to a plot and left the editor to clean up the mess.The end result could be watched in any order and make equally no sense."
491,"This was so much fun on so many levels, especially for kids. There's nothing Dolittle did too little of. It was really well acted, the animals were funny and silly. It's exactly what a children's book would look like come to life.Good to enjoy with kids on holidays. Highly recommended for family entertainment."
492,"This film is not going to be everyone's cup of tea, but if you are the kind of person that wants to be entertained for entertainments sake, then this is a must see film. My whole family thoroughly enjoyed this film. With all that is going on in the world right now it was very pleasent to step away and enjoy this film and our family. Many thanks to the cast and crew for making this film and allowing us to get lost in another world for a couple of hours."
493,"Holy cow - this is a really, really bad movie.How far Robert Downing Jr has fallen?
Why on earth did he take this role?!"
494,I am in love with this new movie about Dr. Dolittle. It is suitable for the whole family and adults can experience emotions just like a child.
495,"So I'm a 40 yr old, and while I'm not the target audience. I did find it an enjoyable movie. The acting was great, scenes were great, maybe not one to watch in theaters because it's getting expensive (ticket + snacks = expensive), but I did enjoy this movie."
496,"Where to begin with this ?
I think if you have a family with young children then there is certainly something here for them, sadly though you will be quickly turned off by the film as an adult.
I like RDJ as an actor and was really looking forward to him sinking his teeth into a new role here and with a stellar cast of actors/actresses lending their voices to his companions I went in hoping for the best but sadly came away disappointed.
There are some quite funny bits to be seen in the film especially early on in the film though these are far too infrequent and the characters are being pushed in ways to try and get you to adhere and feel for their different plights they are going through. Unfortunately though i honestly don't feel anything for these characters and they are quickly forgettable as they are difficult to feel a connection to.
This was the Doctors maiden voyage on the silver screen and even the great RDJ I doubt will be enough to get the funds together for a second onto happen as there simply just is not enough here.
A generous 4/10 but as said before the cgi animals and half decent action will keep the kids entertained for a couple hours."
497,"This movie has lots of entertainment value especially for the younger ones. Seeing Robert Downey Jr. in this role was pretty odd, but it was entertaining nonetheless, even for a young adult like myself. Entertaining rating would be around a 7.5/10 for me, so I recommend it for sure."
498,This was well done with a sweet but sad back ground to the start. The animals were fab loved all the characters and their personalities. I know there's a lot of hate regarding Roberts accent but frankly it didn't put me off. The story was good and flowed well. I would definitely watch a sequel if it was in the offing.
499,"I watched this film without hearing any critics before it, and I can't say that I've had high expectations of it. Saying that this movie is a cliche is an understatement, in fact, there is not a single thing that makes it original, and the whole movie felt like I've seen it 100 times before. Now, saying that it is ""Good family fun"" or ""Good for children"" literally doesn't say anything about the movie's quality. In fact, most of the objectively terrible kids movies are still fun to kids. It is still not an excuse to shamelessly just connect bunch of a overused cliches and jokes and add RDJ as a selling point. With a budget like that they could have at least tried something new rather then just have the same story over and over again without any attempt of originality.***SPOILERS BELOW***
Basically, the story is about a guy that lost his wife and he isolated himself from the the rest of civilization. He is trying hard to avoid any human contact, until one day he goes on, unwillingly at first, a journey to find a mythical fruit that can save the Queen's life. Sounds familiar?"
500,The film is just fun if you go into the movie with the right expectations. it is just a family movie that is primarily fun for the children and people who have remained children at heart
501,"Sorry the ""welsh"" accent spoilt this film for me, just couldn't get past that terrible accident."
502,"I really like Robert Downey Jr, however If I had to listen to his monotone, not very good Welsh accent any longer I would have gone mad. Unfortunately I can only think that he realised his character was far too close to the excellent Sherlock Holmes, so he had to create that awful, clearly dubbed all the way through, voice."
503,"It's comforting in our unsettled world that Hollywood still wants to make this type of escapist family fayre. It ticks lots of boxes, cuddly CGI animals, wacky lead, cute kids, OTT baddie and the message that animals have an important place and should be respected. However alongside all that we need a coherent story and a good script. This has neither and is simply a series of set pieces strung together with very little to link them or care about. Disappointing and hopefully not another tired franchise waiting around the corner."
504,"I think, that this movie is actually pretty good and quite funny. I must say I enjoyed watching it.
It is a little bit different and that is a good thing."
505,"As said in my description. The film is pretty much as expected, a rollicking, adventurous romp through the world with talking animals as the chief entertainment. All of it centered, of course, around the character of Dr. Dolittle, the man who can speak the language of the animals.The humor is acceptable enough, and the animals with their very human qualities are fun to watch and reasonably relatable.But the film was weak for one primary reason: It was a poor choice to cast Robert Downey Jr. as Dr. Dolittle. RBJ is a fun actor and I love his movies, but he is not a great character actor. What other characters has he played?Iron Man - He talked like himself, high energy and witty mannerism.
Sherlock Holmes - He talked like his usual high energy self, with slight accent.
Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang - He talked like himself.
Tropic Thunder - Ok, got me here, total transformation. Probably his best. But in any other movie he always has the same energy and mannerism. It's what he's known for. It's his trademark style.But this time his voice was purposely devoid of his usual self. Instead he talked like a quietly dignified old scholar, even when the situation didn't suit that type of voice. Bland and devoid of emotive content, his lines simply brought no life to the film. He sounded so much unlike himself and it even sounds like his voice was added later (which I'm sure it was, probably recorded separately so that he could get the ""right"" sound each time). In other words, RBJ was cast in the position of an elderly English gentleman, a part that completely didn't fit him at all. The poor acting and abrasive dubbing completely robbed the humanity out of the character. He was wooden and uncharacteristically reserved. They could have put any old man in this part, it didn't need to be an actor who's trademark style had to be muffled."
506,"I'll try and make this short and sweet.This movie had the hallmarks of a movie that would be amazing, possibly and instant classic.
Downey Jr at the lead of what was a great movie when done with Eddie Murphy.
I was excited to see the RDJ charisma and comedy kickoff an epic fresh Dolittle franchise.Nope. Sadly Not.Dont get me wrong there were some amusing points in the movie but that didn't help the forced bore fest that I had to endure.The story was uncompelling to the point I really didnt care how the movie ended and actually found my mind wandering.The acting was poor, I dont expect alot from child actors but damn it was just cringeworthy.I couldn't stop focusing on that welsh accent RDJ was putting on. If your going to put on an accent atleast make sure it blends and feels natural.
I'm sure this was maybe him trying the break the shackles of his tried and true classic style but sadly the attempt fell flat.I see alot of people saying its a kids movie and all that jazz but when you cast an actor like RDJ you naturally expect there to be an adult element aswell much like we got with Murphy in ALL of his ""Childrens"" Family movies.It is was it is.. a poorly made cash grab feeding off the nostalgia of an old classic."
507,"The first hour of the movie was decent, but after their ship got destroyed, it's like they ran out of money or something they cut it so many times, you couldn't see anything what happened on the way to the dragon's liar and the way they helped the dragon was weird as hell.
DOOLITTLE LITERALLY TOOK A BUNCH OF STUFF OUT OF THE DRAGONS.... y'know
Bad movie, not recommended"
508,"This movie is phenomenal where it does really send your imagination running wild. It is great to see Harry Collett on the big screen, where finally all his hard work and dedication has paid off especially now getting to act along with the amazing legendary Robert Downey Jr, like they say when one door closes another one opens, like in Roberts case it is a nice transition from legendary avengers to a lovely family friendly film Dolittle. The VFX is so amazing really adds to the whole magic of the experience while Dolittle is on his travels, also while being backed by his trusty animals with an amazing voice cast that just brings hilarious life to these animals. The overview of the story is where Dolittle is suffering from a horrific loss where he has closed his animal sanctuary for good all in solitary confinement that he is depressed while still living with his Animals who he can communicate with. Just until these two amazing young people turn up to save him from his loneliness, so he can be with his own kind again, where these amazing kids are Tommy Stubbins portrayed by Harry Collett and Lady Rose portrayed by Carmel Laniado, whilst having a lovely cute romance along the way, where they both turn Doctor Dolittles life around for the better. Dolittle eventually agrees to go to the palace after finding out from Lady Rose that the queen is sick where he could lose his animal sanctuary for good if the queen was to die. He eventually embarks on a voyage on his ship with his stowaway apprentice Tommy Stubbins to try to save the queen with lots of twists and turns along the way. All whilst Tommy Stubbins is teaching himself, whilst also being taught by Dolittle to communicate to the animals along the way. As we all kind of really hope that we can communicate to our animals, so that they can understand us too. There is a lot of funny humour in this film with jokes that have secret meanings for older ages that they will understand, my personal favourite flipping the evil bad guy Mudfly off, whilst still leaving funny jokes in there for the younger kids too. This movie is euphoric really takes you back to being a kid letting your imagination running wild. Remaining with a key message to always be open to any possibility and never give up even when something terrible happens, therefore remaining optimistic about the future and not letting anything or anyone put you down."
509,"I went to see this today, with the class I support. Whilst the students enjoyed it, I couldn't help but cringe the whole way through. Acting was incredibly lackluster, the story was disjointed and badly written, and overly silly. All of a sudden, theres a dragon (a beautifully designed one), and they're pulling armour from its rectum?? I'd say give this one a miss. It's only redeeming quality in my eyes is that it's very pretty and the animation is done very well. I'm a big fan of ""kid's"" movies, but this one missed the mark for me."
510,"Right so ill get straight to the point, its a kids film, not a adult film so why all the hate? Well you can review this movie in 2 ways, a kids review & a adult review which i will explain.The Kids Review -
Kids will love the film, why, its bright, colourful, funny, got fluffy animals which kids want to see, derpy & cool personalities on each animal. you have a big bad Gorilla that actually is a softie at heart, you have a big polar bear who is cool & a awesome talking parrot with the approiate name Penny, a dragonfly with big googly eyes & many more animals. What more could a kid want more than that? A kid is not wanting a deep elaborate story with dense character worth, all they are interested in is having a laugh with some funny animals & judging from when i went to the cinema to see this film with my girlfriend, the cinema filled up to almost full with mostly kids & their parents, laughs were made throughout the entire film & all the kids seemed to enjoy it so why the hate from a kids view?Adult Review -
Now, yes as a adult seeing this film it is not great at all but i do understand personally why it is a kids film hence why i didn't give it a really low score, the is almost 0 character building, the film races through at a very very fast pace, they jump from one area to another essentially skipping important plot lines, speaking of plot it has a very generic plot of some head person, in this case the queen has fallen ill due to someone in her circle that has poisoned her, but i do understand the very original of Dolittle was a adventure, not the Eddie Murphy films, which were fantastic btw. I knew from the get go that the big animals would be the scaredy cat in the film & i was more than correct, behold the big Gorilla was the softie that didn't want to hurt anything, i knew the parrot would have a motherly kinda attitude & was correct, you could really predict them things. Also was it me or did Robert Downey Jr speak really quiet in the film? Was it because he was putting on a accent, which sounded Welsh as well, the way he said Boy-O, & Barry sounded like Barri, not saying its a bad thing it sounded like Welsh but i am curios as to where the film thinks it is set or if Dolittle is from Wales? But still even with all those faults it still made me & my girlfriend laugh which is what you want at the end of the day. Just remember who this film is made for.Age - 25

511,"Throw a load of hard drives with computerised animals into a huge bag, add a big Hollywood name or two, create some excruciating accents and forgettable scenarios, pepper with special effects, mattes and nonsensical locations, add a touch of Michael Sheen doing his best and failing miserably... Shake it all up and edit it out into a 100 minutes plus of mildly entertaining drivel that cost 175 million dollars to create!
Yes you've got it... Dolittle 2020 style, all 3, 5 and 8 second cuts - frantic! Better than the truly terrible E. Murphy films, but so confused and weak, and why, oh why, did they give the lead character a Weird, Wavering, Welsh accent?
Now the Rex Harrison Dolittle was nothing to write home about in 1967, it was a flop then, but... It did become a cult classic in later years, and yes it was a warm and fantastical romp for the children of the day, but... I really don't know what market this version is aimed at, its disappointing on all levels, for any age group!Don't expect it to follow any storyline you're expecting, see it for what it is, a technically excellent, competently performed Eton Mess of a film, one which, if over indulged in, will surely make you sick!"
512,"Well that was an enjoyable time with my 10 and 13 year old boys.
It's a kids movie but I thought it was ok too.
Don't go over thinking the movie and you will enjoy it too."
513,This movie is a criminal waste of all the talent and money poured in. There was either too much happening or nothing interesting at all. Downey's Welsh accent was too garbled and the climax with the dragon's rectal examination was a huge let down. Dr.Dolittle.. did very little indeed.
514,"Marvel fanbois are trying hard to save their favourite rdj's new film by dishing out fake 10 star reviews here but i don't think it'll be enough, the film disappoints you at every level even if you decide to leave your brains at home, the tone is wacky and the script is silly, the film never takes off despite having some big names, downey is a misfit and fails to impress you, in then end you leave the theatre feeling disappointed, there's absolutely no reason to watch this even if you're a big downey fan, save your money and watch something else instead"
515,"To me the main problem with this movie was the casting of Robert Downey Jnr. He just doesn't seem the right type to me to play Dr Dolittle, mumbling away all the time, this is why I don't like method actors, couldn't understand what the hell he was saying most of the time. Someone like Dick Van Dyke, in his heyday, would have been perfect, the CGI was OK the script could have done with a bit more humour! Now Downey Jnr. can be an effective actor in the right part, but lightweight fare like this just isn't his forte!"
516,"I just hope, if the movie is that bad, the girl is a good actress. Hopefully better than Nico Parker than Dumbo(2019).That is all."
517,"I'm not sure if it's accent or the character of Doolittle but it was just hard to keep watching. Story line was not that good I guess, again not sure but it was just so hard to watch and seemed like a mess."
518,"It was adorable! Our whole family enjoyed them movie, we have 3 boys (ages 2,6,9). The movies was pretty clean. We are planning on buying it when it come out."
519,"This move was ridiculous but very funny
plot was very simple to follow
the polar bear and ostrich were the funniest
I like how the squirrel was acting like captain kirk narrating like in star trek
the who movie will make you smile and just roll with it and not take it so seriously just sit back and have fun this movie is not trying to impress or win awards it meant to just be enjoyed
also i loved the dragon scene near the end"
520,"I guess the reason that I ended up seeing this film was because my brother likes films with talking animals in them, and this certainly has its fair share of talking animals. However, honestly, I'd have to say that I really didn't find this film to be all that great. In fact, I found that this film was rather dull and boring. I guess the only reason that I did eventually go and see this film is that there really wasn't anything else that I could have considered to be all that interesting.The story is basically about this doctor who shuns humanity and lives locked away in his manor where he spends all his time with animals. In fact, he has learnt how to talk to animals, which is pretty much the running theme of the film (and every other film about this one character). Yeah, I do notice that every so often the story will be revisited in one way or another, though this particular film has been set back in the glory days of the British Empire.Yet, they do try to bring in some different stories as well, not that I quite remember any of the other versions, just that Dr Dolittle happens to be this guy that talks with animals. In this iteration, the reason that he has locked himself away is because his wife went on a journey and never returned, and he has decided to hide himself away because of this. However, it turns out that the Queen has become quite sick, so he is summoned to go and find a cure.Well, as it turns out, this film is an adventure film, set of course in the heydays of the British Empire. Yet, despite that, I did find that this film turned out to be rather dull. I won't necessarily say because it is aimed at the kids, I just found that the whole story was just rather dry and well worn. It really wasn't one of those films that I would be making too much of an effort to see, and a part of me really wished I did something else, except that I had promised to take my brother to see a movie."
521,"The entire family loved this movie tonight. Lots of lauphs and kids talked about it all the way home untill they were tucked in. This is a wonderful and fun family movie. Heard more lauphing in the theatre tonight than i have in years from any other movie and im already wanting to go watch it again! I know my kids would be too! Funny, fun, heartwarming and lovable character's."
522,"I was really looking forward to watching this movie, since one of my all-time favorite actors, Robert Downey Jr., was starring as Dolittle. unfortunately, the accent Downey used with his acting style made the movie almost unwatchable. I was so tempted to get up in the middle of the movie and leave! I honestly don't think that Downey should have tried to do comedy. Eddie Murphy nailed Dolittle's character. Not so much Downey."
523,"I realise this is a children's film but even the kids in the cinema were bored.It moves at a frenetic pace, possibly to cover up for the weak dialogue and thin plot. Not even RDJ's onscreen charisma can save this abomination. There are no loveable characters and the contemporary slang and American accents of many of the animals grated. Speaking of accents, what nationality was RDJ's Dolittle supposed to be??I was not surprised to read that the film bombed at test screenings but even the changes they must have made didn't seem to have helped. The scene where they began removing items from the arse of a dragon (yep, this is in the film), only to have it let out a huge fart ('Eew some of that got in my mouth', said the squirrel - seriously), was a low point.Avoid this film. Save your money. It's a stinker."
524,"Dolittle and gang go on a semi-swashbuckling adventure in search of a legendary macguffin, causing minor ruckuses here and there.Really not much to say, it's a decent ragtag adventure story that's not going to rock your world or anything else as nothing really shines here. The animal CGI is impressive for the most part, but there's just way too many of them vying to be ""the one"" but don't really do much except a scene or two. RDJ brings a good sense of eccentricity and somberness, but let's be real, that accent is Atrocious (yes, with a capital A). It's too wispy and low, making his lines unclear many times.The humor is heavily skewed towards kids, so expect it to mostly fall flat for adults. There were more kids at my showing of Bad Boys 3 than for this one!"
525,"Having young children, such as I expect for many of the persons reviewing these reviews, I've endured the Troll movies, Emoji Movie, and the like. This movie is not bad, not great, maybe lower good. It's cute with a few funny lines. The villain thread is not fully disposed of, like a scene is missing, and the young apprentice portends of sequels. Robert Downey, Jr. is miscast in my view, although he fulfills his obligation. The real issue is that there is nothing overly resonating with the movie; that is, something we feel, or learn, or love or hate, etc., that sticks with us. So, I'll categorize it as casual forgettable fluff, that is as easily watched when available on TV as on the big screen, so it depends on whether you want a minor event with the children at a movie theater, or whether you prefer to do it later at home, but this movie would be rather incidental to the family event itself."
526,"It's hard to know how to describe this film other than a failure. It takes some good actors and does everything it can to sabotage their performance.Firstly, the film handles diversity very poorly. The young girl is Jekyl and Hyde. She starts out Greta Thunberg (a know it all who is condescending to adults) and by the end, she's weepy and forgettable. In fact, many of the female characters are basically know-it-alls. By contrast, all father figures are weak, aggressive and stupid. It's the same Hollywood shtick we get film after film. Weak male characters offset by OP female characters.Then there's the humour. It constantly misses the mark. Even RDJ is not on his game. The film doesn't cleverly target children like the older Pixar films used to. It aims for low-brow. I was waiting for a fart-joke and wasn't disappointed. It's crass American humour, almost as if the writers off-set woke with low-brow in the hope it would deliver a raging success.Also, many elements of the story didn't work. For example, the Queen sent a young (know-it-all) on a trek through the jungle all by her lonesome to fetch Dolittle? It was a long trip because it took them some time to return. This was absurd. Many of the plot points felt like stepping stones rather than a coherent story. As if this would compartmentalise the re-structuring this film would have experienced as it developed.I believe this film will appeal to people who like happy stories without any gravitas. For people looking for intelligent story, meaningful characters or a good story arc, this is not your film. I was really excited for this film which made its failure even worse.Hollywood needs to stop with woke and return to good story writing that is not ideologically motivated. This film will be forgotten, like Dumbo, within 12 months."
527,"Bad acting to go with the bad script. The CGI was amazing, but as far as the film as a whole, I'll stick with with Eddie Murphy's version. At least my kids find that one funny! Surely Dr Dolittle should be a fun character and not a boring, miserable, pretentious one?We're going to watch the old version on Blu-ray tonight at home and remind ourselves how funny the storyline should be!Seriously, how many more classics are going to be destroyed just to make a quick buck? Dumbo, destroyed. Jumanji, destroyed. Now Dr Dolittle..... The older movies are timeless and kids, who they are aimed at and don't forget that, find them funny and lose themselves in those movies. No need to keep renewing them."
528,"Dolittle was directed by Stephen Gaghan and follows Dr. Dolittle who currently lives in seclusion from the rest of humanity. Instead, he lives among animals, and they act as his only friends and companions When he encounters a young boy and girl, he learns that the Queen of England is dying. With this request, he goes on an adventure to find the cure of her illness with the boy as a stowaway.I'm just going to get the good parts of the movie out of the way first. The sole cause of Dr. Dolittle's isolation was the only well-done aspect of this entire movie. This cause is explored more and given an in-depth look during the second half of the film. I have to say, the execution of this cause is done surprisingly well, and I expected the movie to chicken out and go the easy way around. The only other positive I can think of with this film is that there is only one fart joke throughout the entire film. I expected a few, but there really is only one during the end.Everything else about this film is just awful however. My biggest issue with this movie is the animals. The movie is usually quiet and serene, until the animals are in the spotlight. The animals Dr. Dolittle talks to are absolutely irritating at all times. When they aren't doing anything of substance, they're usually cracking bad jokes, talking about nothing or making a pop culture reference. I distinctly remember one of the animals saying ""I'm not crying, you're crying!"" at some point. What makes this so utterly painful is that the animals will not shut up!With that being said, the movie honestly feels like it dragged a lot. It is an hour and forty minutes with credits, yet it felt like it was 2 hours long. This movie has some problems with its pacing, where it takes forever for the ball to finally roll, and even then it leaves the second act slow as well with a rushed third act. This movie could've been much shorter, as it feels like there's a bit of padding.I can't stand Robert Downey Jr.'s British accent; it felt extremely jarring, other than that, his acting his fine I guess. The boy's acting was fine too I guess. It really just comes down to the animals never shutting their mouths and how terribly paced and lackluster the film's plot really is. As a January film, Dolittle is fine for the kids, but I can't see a lot of people liking it. I think this film sucks and I don't know why Robert Downey Jr. would take this role directly after Avengers: Endgame.3/10"
529,"Filled with wonder, cleverness, curiosity and endless imagination. Our family adores this movie. A classic that we've come to watch over and over!"
530,"The movie is just for toddlers. Grownups will suffer.
What makes it worse? Robert Downey Jr. is voiced over by some British guy. So even if you are Robert Downey Jr.'s fun, you'll be dissapointed."
531,"Poor story, uninspiring performance and bad CGI.
Overall, its a very painful experience that lacks character depths.
I cant see myself sitting through it again."
532,"Now... I was planning on seeing that Robert Eggers critically acclaimed film ""The Lighthouse"", but.... it got a limited release and i couldn't see it anytime soon, so.... there wasn't much else to see besides.... some early previews of... ""Dolittle"", I have heard of this film, I know it's another remake based on the story by Thomas Shepherd, it's the second time it's got remade, it's a big disaster at the box office with critics and most audiences, so even though i don't think the trailer looks that bad, I think the film could be worse then what it could of been, but who knows, maybe it'll beeeee...... good?, despite it's negative feedback?, so I saw it at a early preview (The first of February and it's not even out until the seventh....) with a few friends and a pretty packed cinema and...... wow, it's preeeeetty-NO!... embarrassingly bad!, what was Robert Downey Jr. thinking?!..... so let's talk about it!.John Dolittle (Robert Downey Jr.) has a incredible gift, that gift is to talk to animals, so he and her wife open up a sanctuary where all animals can come and live together, however after the passing of her wife, Dolittle just sits around in his house in misery, however after getting the news that Queen Victoria (Jessie Buckley) is ill, Dolittle and his crew of animals go on this big journey to try and find a cure to save her, along with a kid named Stubbins (Harry Collett) who accidentally got roped in to be Dolittle's assistant, however they must hurry before Dr. Blair Müdfly (Michael Sheen) tries to stop our heroes from reaching their destination and has a plan up his sleeve, urgh.... where do I begin?, well I can say that it's not funny.... like at all, I mean I did kind of smirk like for a few seconds and I did find Müdfly funny-ish at times, but the humour just relies on very modern, dumb, toilet and disturbing jokes, which don't effect me at all and it doesn't make the film any better, the story is also just very unoriginal, it just uses cliches to execute the story which just makes it so dull and quite boring, it also tries to throw in emotion but you know exactly what is going to happen, so it doesn't leave you feeling anything then just boredom, the villain's plan is spelled out quite early on in the film, which ruins the twist or any sort of build up at all, which shows that there was no effort or care put into this, the directing feels tasteless and generic, the writing is just awful in how basic it all is, the story of Dolittle could of been so much better in this adaptation, but everything feels wasted and it's uniqueness just wears off most of the time, along with tasteless directing, with terrible humour along with a predicable, boring and dull plot, so basically the director, the writers did ""Dolittle"" to save this mess..... get it?...I guess the only kind of positive I have with Dolittle is in the visuals because to be fair.... it does look pretty nice, it's nicely shot, it has good cinematography, very fitting and cool costumes and... the animal CGI effects look pretty convincing for the most part, so at least there is some effort and care here, however, despite all that good effort and stuff, it doesn't make the film any different or unique at all, it looks pretty generic, the animals don't have much expression on them all, I mean a little, at least it's better then the Lion King remake's expressive animals.., whenever an actor rides a animal or touches them, it doesn't really look like they are actually in the same scene as the actors which is kind of off putting, not only that but the locations and backgrounds while nice are not that impressive looking, they look pretty standard and dull for the most part and don't do much to make it stand out, although I love the animation the opening scene, it's nicely detailed and it's quite beautiful, makes me wish the whole film was animated like that, although the film won't deserve this at all, but I guess I'll give the visuals of this film a pass.All the characters are instantly forgettable, boring and unfunny, I really didn't care about any of them, we'll expect for one or two, John Dolittle himself is just a very unlikeable, goofy and charmless character, I get he's the one who is more of a animal people who is lonely and dosen't want to be friends with the apprentice, but he's just any other character who has all those cliches, even if he starts to warm up to the kid, he is still kind of weird and really goofy, as for Stubbins, he is really just there to help out, which also doesn't help since he doesn't do that much and he is quite annoying and quite bland, Lady Rose I thought would have more screen time with Stubbins as a love interest, but they barely does anything and just looks after the Queen and her chemistry with Stubbins just comes out of nowhere, the animals that join Dolittle are equally obnoxious, Jip (Tom Holland), Yoshi (John Cena), Plimpton (Kumail Nanjiani), Dab-Dab (Octavia Spencer) and Kevin (Craig Robertson) are just annoying and so unfunny with their personality and modern references, although I didn't mind Chi-Chi (Rami Malek), he did kind of make me smirk a little, but not by much, the only character that was mildly enjoyable with Müdfly, he's just a bizarre a terrible villain, but at least he's entertaining thanks to Michael Sheen, as for the acting.... well... it's passable I guess?, Robert Downey Junior does try his best with his performance, but it results in him being incredibly goofy and at time hard to understand his accent, I guess he is okay over all but definitely no Tony Stark, Michael Sheen is at least having a blast with his role, Jim Broadbent, Jessie Buckley and Antonio Benderas are pretty wasted on how little screen time and personality they are given, as for Harry Collet and Carmel Laniado, they do also try but they sound quite bored, too whiny and dull when they act, the voice acting is okay at best, Emma Thompson, Tom Holland, John Cena, Ralph Fines, Selene Gomez, Craig Robertson do decent jobs voicing their characters, but with the ridiculous amount of celebrities they got in this fo is distracting, they don't give their characters a different identity, they just sound like themselves and for the audiences to go ""Oh I know who that is!"", the characters are pretty one demential and annoying, but the acting is okay for the most part, I mean don't get me I like all these celebrities, but there is really no need to bring the most popular ones around, which unfortunately doesn't help that the characters are just forgettable.On a side note, the best thing about this film is the song ""Original"" from Sia, I am a big fan of her and her songs and her song here is fantastic, wonderful lyrics, great atmosphere, any film even if it's bad has a song from Sia will be a positive, also Danny Elfman's Score is nice and beautiful as always, so there is that.Well... I can say this... film does give us what the title suggested.... it did dolittle to make a good film, Dolittle is a tasteless disaster that could of been so much better, it's poorly directed, cliched, predictable, annoying, unfunny and forgettable, most of the actors are just wasted by not doing much and dull characters along with generic visuals, although i did enjoy Müdfly and a bit of Chee-Chee, it is a beautiful looking film along with nice music, but it's not even enough to save this incredibly dumb and wasted family film, this could of been quite enjoyable, but it did nothing to grab my attention, I guess kids can go and see it but there are way better family films to watch, Spies in Disguise is still out and Frozen 2, go see them instead, they have a lot more to offer to kids and the entire family, I mean it's nice RDJ is doing this for his kids to watch, but it's not a great Post-Endgame start...Dolittle easily gets a 2/10."
533,"Whilst Dolittle isn't a colossal disaster, it isn't a good movie. And no matter who plays the lead character, they wouldn't be able to save the film.I feel sorry for RDJ although he is really talented, it's been so long since he has been able to use his talent in great films (not including his performance as Iron Man)It had potential and the first half wasn't so bad but the film as a whole feels underwhelming in every way. A lack of humour, a lack of adventure and most importantly a lack of redeemable qualities.
Everything feels off sadly.The CGI is really iffy at times. The animals are fine. It's everything else which looks weird. Although the voice actors are pretty fine for the roles they were inOverall I did enjoy some of it but it quickly fails as a movie and slowly unfolds into a disaster. Just avoid it, unless you want to see RDJ getting farted on by a Dragon"
534,"I am not sure who thinks this is only mild intense on the parental advisory listings. Also Comments about this movie being appropriate and family entertainment for elementary school kids is totally misleading. The first half of the movie is ok only a few spots we had to ask both our kids (6 and 12) to cover their eyes.
However Many intense and scary scenes right after they set off on the boat voyage, being attacked by cannons of the larger ship.
On the island it got worse with loud angry lions, an extremely scary villian character. We left the theatre at this point and so did a family with older kids.it could have been a cute movie and first half was really enjoyable, not sure why they had to wreck it with scary scenes not appropriate for kids."
535,"A depressed Dolittle (Robert Downey Jr.) must go out on an adventure to obtain a rare plant to save the queen. He is accompanied by a young boy apprentice.The melancholy nature of the Dolittle character sets the mood for the story as he laments for his lost Lily from beginning to end. A happy Dolittle taking both Stubbins (Harry Collett) and Lady Rose (Carmel Laniado) creating duo gender role models would have made a much better feature, especially if they eliminated the dragon blockage scene. Just pull out the thorn."
536,"Review:
'Dolittle' is a fantasy-adventure film directed by Stephen Gaghan. It is based on the titular character created by Hugh Lofting, and primarily inspired by 'The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle'.
The whole time I was watching this movie I was thinking, ""where is Johnny Depp?"". He usually likes these weird takes on well-known stories. That being said, I do have to say he dodged a bullet because I find this movie to be a bit of a mess.
This movie is based in England where we find Dr. John Dolittle (played by Robert Downey Jr.) whom is a famed doctor and veterinarian. After losing his wife several years ago and locking himself away from the world, he is drawn back out again when he is called to help the Queen. He sets sail to a mythical island where he discovers wondrous creatures and reunites with old friends along the way. The premise of the movie seemed lackluster from the get-go which unfortunately seemed to let the movie down and not live up to the fame of the Dolittle name.
I don't know exactly what Robert Downey Jr. was thinking when he decided to take this movie on. He was fresh off 'Avengers: Endgame' and probably had his pick of the litter movie-wise and decided on this? He didn't seem to care about the project - he is a great actor but didn't seem to give this movie any of his heart, just doing this project for a paycheque when he didn't have to. He also gives one of the worst accents I've ever heard in a movie. Accents are a big thing for me and if an actor can't pull it off throughout the entire film it throws me off. While Downey Jr didn't hit the mark for me, this film does have an all-star cast of voice actors, who do a good job portraying their animal counterparts. They were really the star of this film.
The movie is definitely directed towards young children when it comes to the comedy. There are no jokes for adults, yet when we get to the end of the movie there is a scene that might be a little intense for really young viewers. I don't think this movie knew what it wanted to be, or it just got made quickly and was dumped in January without a care. Because of the sloppy writing and crazy performance by Robert Downey Jr., I unfortunately checked out of this movie within the first 20 minutes.
Overall, I wholeheartedly believe that young viewers will like this movie. It has cute animals and child-directed humor, but it doesn't have anything for the adults to enjoy. If you want to scoop your kids up and head to a viewing of this film, I believe they will have a blast. It just wasn't a film for me.
2/5"
537,"A movie strictly for kids, I believe as the storytelling experience was defined in such a way.
Even after watching it in IMAX, it didn't surprise much in one single scene.
No big VFX, not so good music. Except for the talking of humans with animals, there was nothing else that's mentionable."
538,Wow...this movie is TERRIBLE. I only give it a 5-6. What the hell is RDJ or his agent thinking...like the script is bad and every other aspect of the movie is cringy. I guess now that RDJ got so much money from Iron Man hes just screwing around...lol...this movie is horrendous; it shouldn't exist.
539,"Dolittle is every bit the trainwreck I thought it was gonna be. It's also one of the most embarrassing things I've seen. It's hard to believe Robert Downey, Jr. sinking so low after the immeasurable high of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He looks like an insane homeless man who has no idea what movie he's in or what's going on around him. It's like watching an anomaly, something caught between the original 1967 film and the 1998 remake. Maybe a producer was watching the original film, got confused and thought, where's the terrible Chris Rock comedy and fart jokes? Then he put them both in a blender to make a terrible smoothie. A film set in Victorian England, but with modern day dialogue and comedy. One of these things is not like the other. As a result, we get an excruciating 2 hours of something only a 3 year old would be entertained by and that no decent writer would be caught dead writing. We also get awful voice acting, a literal mustache twirling villain, and the most irritating accent I think I've ever heard in a movie coming from Downey. Is it Scottish? Is it Dutch? I don't know. All I know is he thinks he's in another Sherlock Holmes movie. Everyone around him also looks like they had no idea what kind of movie they were making. Which makes sense, given the rumors of three different directors and a bunch of reshoots. The only decent stuff is the opening. We get a nice little whimsical score, some decent watercolor animation, basically what the entire movie should have been. If it was animated, even stop motion and treated like a LAIKA film, it would have been amazing. Our theater was filled with a lot of old people, probably because they confused it for the original Rex Harrison movie. So much cringe inducing dialogue and comedy, and a plot you can predict in your sleep. No wonder all the worst stuff comes out in January. I'd rather talk to my dog for two hours, and he doesn't know what I'm saying, but at least we would both feel something."
540,"Frankly, I'd expect something else... The Eddie Murphy's version is funny at least... This has no plot, no moral advice, nothing."
541,"Review:
After reading some terrible reviews about this film, I thought that I would give it the benefit of doubt, mainly because Robert Downey Jr. is one of my favourite actors. One of the main problems with this film is that we don't get the usual quick-witted Downey Jr., and the script was extremely awful. The CGI is top form, even though the plot is totally unrealistic, and the huge sets were put together well, but it was a shame to see all that effort go down the drain. The film is very poorly written and a lot of the scenes seemed pointless, And I know that I might be alone on this one, but I preferred the Eddie Murphy versions, which were basically what they said on the tin. On top of that, Downey's Welsh/Scottish accent was appalling, and his acting was the worse I have seen from him. The villain of the plot, Dr. Blair Mudfly (Michael Sheen), was a blithering idiot and Dolittle's sidekick, Stubbins, became annoying after a while. On the plus side, the animals saved the film, especially the Gorilla and the Squirrel, but they weren't enough to make the movie interesting. At the end of the day, it was a bad day at the office for Downey, even though it made a profit at the box office, and with his name down as executive producer, along with his wife as Producer, I hope that Sherlock Holmes 3 and Pinocchio turn out to be much better. Disappointing!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Stephen Gaghan, who also brought you Abandon in 2002, Syriana and Gold starring Matthew McConaughey. For such a big movie, he wouldn't have been my first choice because it needed someone with a lot of experience behind the camera. It does make me wonder if these movies are all about the money nowadays, and not about entertaining an audience because they couldn't have been happy with the screening before they released it to the public. I can't totally blame Downey because he was talking to animals that weren't there, but I would have questioned the script after reading it. With all that aside, I'm sure that the young target audience will enjoy it, especially if you're watching it as a family day out, but I personally won't be watching it again in a hurry.Budget: $175million

542,"Terrible terrible film, what possessed RDJ to do a ""bloke down the pub does welsh"" accent I really don't understand. Managed about 20 minutes and had to give up and I paid for it!!! Avoid avoid avoid"
543,"It is a shame when some viewers are so overly-critical and jaded that they can't appreciate and enjoy a good family movie when they see one. Rating this movie 1 star is stating, ""This is one of the worst movies ever made."" That's not an objective and accurate review. If someone doesn't like kid's movies, don't watch kid's movies.This film is good family fun. It's witty, the writing and acting good, the directing, cinematography and CGI all excellent. Parts of it are funny, a few tear-jerker moments, and Downey's acting is excellent as always (despite the odd accent).This was simply a good movie, with fun characters, a sense of imagination and fantasy, and adventure. Doctor Dolittle has always been an unusual and fantastical concept. This movie presents that concept well, and throws in some human elements to the mix. Well worth watching."
544,"I don't even know what to say, this thing just isn't good.You literally have a scene where Dr. Dolittle pulls armor out of a dragon's butthole and then the dragon farts in his face. Absolutely ridiculous. It amazes me what passes for comedy these days. I'm sure your 5 year-old's will giggle at this movie, but man is this thing awful."
545,"First this is exactly like The Rock Jumanji. Just ride the famous title of Eddie Murphy Dolittle. But hey they used Tony Stark as main characters! Its should be good. But idk. Its a kids movie but i really hope theres no sequel of this...Plus:
Robert Downey Jr. Is a good actor. Hes not only Tony Stark, hes been Charlie Chaplin and other movie that I forgot the title. Hes quite versatile. Hes pulling that Welsh accent good. Almost its feel like Gandalf or Dumbledore speaking dthan Tony Stark.The world setting clearly different than Dolittle original that closer to our real world. Here his world is alternate version of humans acan live with animal more than pet and England is still Classic Monarch. Also world here is full of magical beast such as dragon, and other fantasy.The costume and culture here is still 1700-1800 steampunk era. Which is the best look for westerner for me.The intro animtaion is top notch. Really..Minus:
The plot is too broad. Its boring linear adventure. Idk i teally hope it had atleast fun events, fun battle, or fantasy enlightening things. But its only the journey of supposed to be doctor that can talk to animals to save the queen of england with finding the cure. Just that. Nothing special.CGI is bad. Nothing eye pleasing. It's like watching CGI animals movies from 2015 or older.Some scene can be shoot better with different angle.Also this is personal:
Its truly insult to Dolittle"
546,"I really think this movie has had a bit of a bad wrap from some. The CGI might be questionable, the ""Welsh"" accent is certainly questionable, but on the whole, this is a fun, no brainer with some excellent humor and story. My kid absolutely loves it, he must have watched it 100 times in the last few weeks. So, for what it is, its great. And if you've got kids, it will keep them entertained for ages."
547,I don't understand bad comments of this film. It's Dolittle of RDJ don't compare in your past or your imagination. It's fun with family.What do you expect ?
548,"We used to be good at CGI, Look at Titanic and Jurassic Park. Then watch this thing. The animals may as well have been puppets or men in suits, I feel this would have looked better. The dog was particularly bad. Also, the rest of it was guff too"
549,"The movie could have been a grand adventure with thrilling action and chases etc. However it seemes quite rushed the sea journey to landing at monte verde skipping straight to breaking into the castle without really seeing the island. Another very quick sea journey to find the fruit ... A few small scenes here and there would have just added a little more depth. mudfly is defeated somewhat easily and didnt really feel much of a threat. The stick insect was left behind to spy on the queens room but we had no scenes of what actually happens there.
Anyone else who has seen this film questioning dolittles welsh accent? Its mumbling and distracting the original dolttle character from the childrens books nationallity is british-american the character was inspired by a scottish surgeon john hunter. So if anything a scottish accent would have been more accurate perhaps. Also no sign of the pushmi-pullyu one of the more magical creatures from the dr. Dolttle stories. I would recommend the eddie murphy dr. Dolttles over this one even if they are completely different from the books they do provide a good laugh and do not drag.
So to sum up rushed , lacks the adventure it should have, a shame considering the cast.
Best acting: carmel laniado (lady rose)
Worst acting: michael sheen (mudfly)"
550,I thought it was gonna be hard to sit through but it was great. Nice to watch with kids around 8 years old.
551,Rdj does a fabulous job! The movie is fun and cute and my 12 year old daughter and I loved it!
552,"Dolittle (1 out of 5 stars).Dolittle is a mess of a family adventure film based on a character that can talk to animals. Dr. Dolittle movies with Eddie Murphy was more fun and entertaining than this. This movie follows on a story of voyage of Doctor Dolittle. Where he goes on a cruise adventure to find a medicinal plant to help save the queen. Robert Downey Jr is a great actor. He could have been a great choice for Dolittle. Sadly, the movie fails with a horrible cheesy script. The direction is a mess. It can not stay in one tone or have a coherent direction.The movie is a complete mess. The humor is awkwardly cheesy and unfunny. I dont think even kids will enjoy it. And boring for the adults. The cast ensemble is good but they are all wasted in a bad script. The visual effects is terrible with all the cgi animals. For a big budget movie, they did not improve on the visual effects at all. The performances and voice talent were all tedious and boring. The plot is dull. It lacks the emotional depth with the characters which it was trying hard for.Overall, Dolittle is a horrible film. It lacks fun. The humor is bad. The visual effects, acting, script, and direction is all horrible."
553,"Dolittle is a complete mess of a movie. With no coherent plot or consistent theme, this film fails to be an entertaining comedy, adventure, or family film. It's painfully boring to sit through and the type of humor in the film is simply just insulting to its audience both young and old.Nothing in the films quite works for me despite some serious talent behind and in front of the screen. Yet, this film feels like it should not have been made. Flawed at the script level, no amount of great performances or convincing visual effects (which it does not have) could have saved this film from being strange in all the wrong ways.If there was more competence on display besides some solid cinematography and sound editing, the film may hold up but I wouldn't recommend this one to any family or child. There are better family films for young children to enjoy that have real narrative construction and sensible progression of story."
554,"Sometimes you come along a film that compels you to write a review. Following the franchise since the first one came out, this one just is a shameful addition to the list.The plot was alright, and the CGI was acceptable too. However, terrible dialogues, and worse acting makes the movie a waste of time. I have watched many, many bad movies. This is amongst the top 10 waste of time movies. Robert seems to be only able to act when high and being Ironman. In this movie, he could barely open his mouth.Great watch if you are under the age of 0."
555,"I am really disappointed with this movie
It has no story and really bad acting like if the cast wanted to finish it as quickly as possible"
556,An interest filled & fun movie for generations. All areas of art & talent & professional skills are expressed in this film. Not to mention the enthusiasm for certain human/animals character stories to unfold.
557,"Slightly below average movie, just about bearable because of RDJs acting, but the voice... why why why, when he can do an awesome English accent did the director insist on a very bad (understatement!) Welsh one... so much potential :-("
558,Took my 10 year old daughter to see this. I wasnt expecting much because of the reviews but I was very pleasantly surprised. Why do people expect so much from movies today? We both thoroughly enjoy and had fun watching it.
559,"This film is appalling. RDJ's attempt at an accent (I think Welsh) was terrible, but fitted perfectly with the rest of the film, which was also terrible. It may be a kids movie, but definitely not a family movie, as it's not the kind of film that everyone can enjoy. If your kids enjoy it, let them watch it without you - no one should have to suffer this."
560,"I wasn't sure if I wanted to go to the theaters for this one (I knew I would see it eventually at home) but ended up going with a child who wanted to see it and found myself loving every second of it. Sure, you could criticize some of the humor, but it's meant to be entertaining to children and it's exactly the kind of stuff they find funny. There was plenty that I, as an adult, found hilarious too. The story is simple and predictable, but sometimes that's exactly what I want. The scenery and concept design was gorgeous and the animal CGI was, in my opinion, really well done. There was never a moment when I thought, ""They shouldn't have done this, they didn't have the budget for it."" I thought it all looked real enough.It was a fun fantasy adventure somewhat comparable to Pirates of the Caribbean, just a bit more child-oriented.I really loved finding out at during the credits who did all of the voices. A lot of A-listers whose voices I didn't recognize while watching. So many big names in this movie.I went with a ten year old who enjoyed it, though I probably enjoyed it even more than she did.I gave it a 10/10 because I have an overactive imagination but I can't think of anything major I would have changed. I honestly did not want it to end and would watch a sequel in a heartbeat."
561,"I don't know what accent Mr Downey was trying to do, but wasn't from Earth! I like Robert Downey Jr. but this is a total misfire. Go watch the original Rex Harrison version."
562,I decided to watch this film because I liked the look of the trailer even though it had bad reviews. There was a couple of corny bits in it but overall I thought it was good. I think kids would enjoy it. Each to their own
563,"Really not sure what all the bad press was about! It's a fun, family movie with a great cast! Not sure why the 'critics' were in such a cranky mood, but this was far better than some wanted the viewers to believe. It's lots of fun!"
564,"I was excited from beginning to end. This is an amazing feel good film and I was hoping to see more like it. By the looks of it people are stuck on the idea of the asshole character of iron man and were hoping for more of that and hated the film, so it's very unlikely for there to be more. Robert did an amazing performance, i could even compare his work to the diverse characters of Johnny Depp. I'm looking forward to seeing more of the characters that Robert has to show us."
565,"This looks rushed. Very rushed, like it was meant to be longer at maybe 2 hours and more, but somebody decided to cut scenes of to keep it shorter. It skips all over, no fluidity from one to the next scene. R.D.J. is good, but the rest of the actors feel wooden. Especially the young girl. CGI is amazing, this would have been great with better editing. Probably fun for young kids, and it's not terrible for adults."
566,"Despite the terrible reviews, I took my child to see this. I found myself chuckling multiple times by the halfway point. It was then I realized that so many of the reviews I read a few hours earlier where from folks with inflated expectations.
This is a funny and entertaining movie for children and adults. It won't win any Oscars, but it's also not the bomb that it's reported to be."
567,"I think the so called professional critics forget who these type of films are made for. I took my 9 year old son and he gave it 10 out of 10. As an adult I give it 6. I do enjoy family films and this is harmless fun, not much of an adventure for teenagers and upwards but absolutely fine for kids. Not a classic but kids under ten will enjoy and laugh. Pleasant enough"
568,"If you are ever to get anything from this film, you will need to have never read any of Hugh Lofting's books; and must have forgotten what you have seen on screen before (mind you, the Eddie Murphy version is best forgotten anyway). If you can manage to do that, then what you will find here is a perfectly enjoyable ""Narnia""-esque family adventure film with Robert Downey Jnr. in the title role. In this iteration, Queen Victoria is seriously ill and ""Dolittle"" is dragged from a self-imposed retirement to travel to the ends of the earth - aided by his gang of animal allies and ""Stubbins"" (Harry Collett) a young lad who accidentally shot a squirrel whilst aiming at some ducks - to find a rare fruit to cure her. Jim Broadbent and Michael Sheen seem to be up to no good as they combine to thwart our would be rescuers and we have a couple of cameo scenes from Antonio Banderas. It's not really adult fayre, and the animation lacks the spectacular style of Disney; but it has some cute personal touches and Downey is on quite good form throughout."
569,"If you have kids they might enjoy it,but you will not. Bad script and worse dialogue make the movie a failure . But there are a lot of special effects in this movie."
570,"It just wasn't very funny, nor very adventurous. Robert Downey was a bit of a dissapointment. To much Ironman? The roles of Antonio Banderas & Martin Sheen in the movie were a bit small and lacked depth. Just like the lovestory of Dr. & Lily Doolittle was kinda flat. But for the children it's certainly a nice and entertaining movie for a rainy day."
571,The accent killed it for me. Otherwise it was entertaining of sorts. The 7Y old liked it.
572,"I just couldn't get past Robert Downey Jr's really bad Welsh accent ! I really don't know why they made him Welsh ! It is a hard accent for anyone to emulate - let alone an American !! He would have been much better if he had been able to keep his American accent as i think he was concentrating too much on his accent and not enough on his character !The CGI and talking animals were fun and well done, but the movie was lacking compared to the Eddie Murphy ones. Eddie Murphy's character fir far better and the comedy in the originals was more natural. In this, everything just felt a little over done or a little over the top."
573,"Just watched this movie ONLY because of RD J, crappy story line, waste of time, he shouldn't do this movie."
574,"The only thing I was excited for was Tom Holland and he was only voicing a dog. The best part of this movie was the coloring, and that's sad. The plot was boring, I walked out three times. Even Robert Downey jr couldn't save this movie"
575,I'm absolutely astounded to find any negative comments about this production or such a low score. Our family watched this and continuously loved every moment! We were surprised and laughed. My husband and I were moved by the premise. Our children giggled and drank up the very idea! It's obvious our world is going extinct on imagination and must be endorsing wretched violence and a lack of learning to forgive in exchange for childhood at any age. I'm amazed at critics failing to appreciate every avenue that must be taken to bring this to life and made beautifully. Bravo to every worker that made this movie possible!!! (Shouted the one small voice...)
576,"I really dont understand all the negativity around this movie. It's got great acting, funny jokes, and rdj. It's all round just an enjoyable movie. It's not breaking new ground or anything, but it's fun! If you just wanna enjoy a decent movie that's not trying to reinvent the wheel, go for this!"
577,"It was ok. Not a movie I could watch again. RDJ does the worst Welsh accent I've ever heard, not that I knew Dr D was Welsh. It had a weak and predictable storyline. The all star cast was cool and the special effects were decent. That's about it."
578,"It feels just pointless and a retread of other films, only good bit is Selena Gomez boobs aan legs"
579,This is not an adult film but I enjoyed it a lot - more to the point my five year old son and all the other kids in the cinema loved it - there aren't that many films suitable for young children and they are hard to do - actors of Robert Downey juniors calibre should be thanked for making the effort to help out all us parents on rainy Saturday afternoons ! not panned by critics - great film - thanks
580,"Another good reminder of why I should judge for myself and not listen to reviews. This has been pushed by the critics so I was pleasantly surprised that I write enjoyed this film.The animation is pretty good and although the storyline is not too complicated and obviously aimed very much at kids, it is ok and makes for good harmless fun. But the best thing about the film is the humour, it's very funny in places.This film isn't an Oscar winner but it is well worth a watch."
581,"He goes hoo hoo huu huu to a monkey. No one complained about his monkey accent. also he hasn't spoken to people for years, of-course he isn't going to speak good human, he hasn't spoken it for years."
582,The first and foremost - the direction and screenplay is abysmal and the movie lacks smooth continuity of scenes. The acting is average at best including Roberts who is the only reason because of which i didn't walk out of the theatre. This movie having such a high budget is not anywhere in comparison to any adventure fantasy such as Narnia or Harry Potter or even for that matter The Wizard of Oz was so much better. There is no heart to it and can be easily forgotten. Not worth your time.
583,"The story is a good one and the screenplay could have been better.especially the middle portions.The starting and ending was good.As you dont expect more, this is just a watchable movie."
584,"If you're thinking this to be the next Academy Award winner, then don't watch. Though if you're looking for a cozy family time your children will love then you should definitely watch it. Even adults with the right mindset (happy and cheezy!!) will enjoy the ride.I rarely review, but I just thought the metacritics were too unfair. Again, take it for what it is, a family adventure movie!"
585,"Its a movie for children
Funny scenes for kids to laugh
Nothing more than that
Families can enjoy it with their children"
586,"A good movie for kids, it was actually better than I expected. There's a feeling of adventure, some action and humour. The plot is at times predictable but it's ok. The only thing me and my niece were missing was women/girls, as they're very few and they're like 5min on the screen. As my niece concluded ""it would seem only boys go on adventures"". But my 9 year old nephew loved it."
587,This film isn't as bad as the box office performance implies. It's the perfect film for a Sunday afternoon.
588,"Had an exciting plot, sort of pirates of the carribean meets Prince caspian, but poorly executed. Shame as there is so much scope with CGI to create exciting scenes but it was wasted. Not a bad movie and my kids sat through it okay but they weren't blown away."
589,"I sleep during the third part of the movie, its so boring."
590,Even a kids film needs something for the adults and this one was wafer thin in that department. Antonio Banderas gave the best performance by a mile. I can't see how anyone could honestly review this as a 9/10 unless trying to make a point to the people who have slaughtered it unnecessarily
591,Great visual effects and some humerous scenes but a shame the story line doesn't flow. Kids asking too many questions about how and why. Also given the era the film is set the use of language for animals was wrong and just made it feel cheesy. Had such potential. Wait for DVD release if interested.
592,Yes I know it's not a sequel but that's what it seemed like. It rushes though a back story over the opening credits of what would have been a possible good film. What you get is a below average middle film that almost but doesn't set up the third film. I'm guessing the set up for the proper sequel got cut from the end because they would be mad to make more of these. Then again how many transformers films was it before they got it right with Bumblebee. Still not the worse film I've watched recently
593,"In this youth-oriented film, highest paid American actor, Golden Globe winner and five-year people's choice award champion Robert Downy Jr. saves the day by dislodging buildup in a dragon's."
594,"I couldn't move past Robert's fake, odd accent. What was that?The animals were brilliantly done."
595,"Not good, not terrible. Watch out for fake reviews! There are 2 kinds of people in the business. The job-ers; just in it to sell a movie like a roller coaster and artists that actually care about their work"
596,"I cant say I really enjoyed this film, it was more of a relief when it was finally over. The problem with the film is that the pretext to the film, sounds way more interesting than the film itself. If they had made a film about that, I think it would have been more watchable. Robert Dowling Jnr mumbles his way through the film and you never really connect with any of the characters. The plot is equally feeble. The film seems to reside in a no-mans land. To lame for adults to enjoy, and too odd for it to be a successful childrens film. Such a shame because it should have been easy to make a great film about a man who can talk to animals.... surely ?"
597,". . . recycling Beloved Children's Classics as Horror flicks for the single-digit age set. After all, FRANKENSTEIN, DRACULA and THE MUMMY might not be every six-year-old's cup of chocolate milk. After murdering ""Thanos"" and his army in AVENGERS, Bob Downey sets out to terrorize the pre-teen set as the misanthropic DOLITTLE (complete with vermin thriving amid his Rip Van Winkle-length beard). Within DOLITTLE's domain, everyone else is keen on killing the Queen, with the understanding that in this alternate universe anyone in the vicinity when their Ruler is rubbed out can ascend to power just like a mob boss. As the monarch's maniacal doctor, chancellor and archbishop vie to determine which of them can do her in first, her palace guard loiter idly by, perhaps hoping that their inaction will somehow earn them a piece of the pie. With the Real Life Royal Turmoil roiling not-so-Great Britain the week of DOLITTLE's debut, many viewers are likely to wonder if Universal knows something of which no one else is aware. Hopefully, QE2 has a staff of food tasters!"
598,I saw this movie with a friend yesterday and It was funny. Some of the parts were hilarious (the dragon farting after Dr. Dolittle and the animals unclog her bowels) but overall it was just ok. Kids would enjoy it.
599,"It was okay to watch just because if you could talk to all animals it would be great and the script was good enough, just that the characters did not interact very well. It was as if they just read their script parts and that is all that mattered. No real interaction or dynamic interplay that kept one interested. Too bad."
600,"I am a both a die-hard Robert Downey Junior fan and an animal fan so I didn't think there would be any way this movie could disappoint me. Boy was I wrong! Without going into a lot of detail and spoilers, the movie was so frenetic and his character was so frenzied and one-dimensional that it was more annoying than it was amusing( unless maybe you're toddler) . Probably the worst movie Robert Downey Junior's ever been in, that I know of anyway. If you must see it, don't waste a lot of money, see it on DVD."
601,"Dolittle got everything wrong down to the very basics of film. An incoherent amalgamation of random scenes and settings very loosely resembling a plot. The jokes were cheap, lazy, and never landed. Some of the dialogue left me genuinely speechless with how that could possibly have been written and approved. The characters are given NO proper introduction or growth or any detail at all but we're given multiple 'emotional' moments between these characters that we essentially know nothing about for the entire movie. I do not remember the names of any of the animals except chee chee? Since for one he was actually given a tiny slither of development, and I'm being generous saying that. Do not get me started on RDJ's accent, it's confusing, it's fake sounding, it's awful. You will need subtitles. Oh, and RDJ sticks his arm up a dragon's behind and lets it fart all over his face. No, that was not a joke, that actually happens.
175 million dollars went into this atrocity, more than two of the LotR movies combined. Need I say more."
602,"When a less than 2 hour long kids movie easily feels like 5, you have a problem. First of all, RDJ plays the same role he always plays here, only with an awkward accent this time. The rest of the cast is all A-list as well but, just as we saw with Murder on the Orient Express (2016), that can sometimes actively work against a film rather than help it. In this case, the budget was wholly wasted on casting celebrities, none of whom even sounded like their normal selves because they were all doing silly voices. The credits were shocking to me and the person I was watching with. They should've just cast professional voice actors who can do these types of voices much better (it's not as if children actually care who's voicing the animals) and used the saved budget on better screenwriters and more realistic CGI. Speaking of children, I can't imagine any kids enjoying this movie and I say that as someone who teaches kindergarten and first grade. It's just too long and boring and there are too few quality jokes. There's a lot of gross out humor - including one painfully long scene in which the good doctor is removing all manner of things from an animal's rectum (PG rating, folks!) and various other bathroom humor. I actually witnessed the only parent and child in the theater leave after the first half hour, never to return, so that tells you all you need to know.If it's not entertaining enough for children and too childish for adults, the film has no audience. Weak showing for RDJ's first non-Marvel film in years."
603,"I'm not even sure kids will enjoy this.. It seems made for kids but has all the elements it a ""stoner"" movie.. Dull cast, boring voice overs and overused fart jokes.. Slow plot and overall very forgettable! Least the 1998 dolittle had Eddie Murphy to carry the comedy along with some greats.. This tho.. Is just another dreadful movie.. Can see why Jr sticks to iron man movies now.. He's definitely lost his edge.. Spent to much time in the CGI lab I think..."
604,"Such a great film, I enjoyed throughly I don't understand why the critic reviews are so bad. Fun for everyone and the Welsh accents plus references were fantastic. A credit to Wales!"
605,This is the most average movie I've ever seen ever
606,"This movie seems like it was supposed to be made for kids, but it seems there's more jokes for adults than kids. I believe they could have picked someone better besides Robert Downey Jr. (or iron man)."
607,"I blame the sound man for the corrosive recording of Downey whenever he talks - one cannot understand him half of the time. The animals are cute, well done and talk well but have zero movement in plot most of the time. But it was frustrating to try to understand Downey when he was jumping in and out of a low volume accent all the time. His costume with the top hat was marvelous but that does not make a movie. We walked out of this one and got money back. Wait for TV presentation and save money. Sad really - wanted to like it alot."
608,"..and this one won't be the exception. A darker, murkier version. Along with a jumbled script. Really bad accents. I was thinking Michael Sheen would be far better in the lead the whole time.It's like nobody ever bothered to read the books. They just ran with the concept. That's for ALL versions. Why RDJ chose this movie is beyond me? Does he really need the money?Little kids might like it, but go to one of those deluxe theaters with comfy seats and serves alcohol. You'll need it. Designate a driver! It's a drag. Adults will be sleepy and impaired.This is a really good example of a movie to force your ex husband to go to, if you're angry with him!It's currently hitting a 5.6 rating review and that's only because of all the people giving it 10 star and 9 star ratings which it does not deserve. They should be hooked up to a lie detector! C'mon with all the great children movies hitting 8s? This was a 10? LOL"
609,This movie was the first I watched this year so it is setting the time for my 2020 cinema experience. The animal characters delivered funny jokes and one liners while John Dolittle himself was interesting character in parts. Dolittle's accent was atrocious and terribly delivered and his character felt almost stagnant and worthless in sections. The humour is what saves this movie as you can have a good laugh in this. It really is a decent movie and I would recommend watching this with your family
610,"They hired Robert Downey Jr. a brilliant actor to act like Jonny Depp another brilliant actor:(
If you notice the trailer scenes showed glimpses of Downey acting like Downey. The majority of the movie the director had him acting like Depp whose characters border on insanity :(
Downey plays extremely intelligent quick witted characters. The slow witted director could have tailored the movie around Downey's character type and possible had an award and sequels in the future.
*If you have an award winning actor, then you tailor the character around the actor.*A doctor that learned at least 15 different animal languages and is affiliated with royalty is more suited to a Downey character than a Depp character anyway."
611,RDJ voice is horrible with a British accent. Animals are funny. The plot is terrible. I wished I would have waited for DVD release. I could not understand what RDJ was saying. His accent sucked!!!
612,While it was ok at best Robert Downey Jr was by far the hardest thing to get past. The whole movie sounded like he spoke in a whisper that was added after filming. The animal voices sounded more realistic (also poor sounding) then his.Also major plot points where skipped over quickly or things that truly did not matter lasted far to long.While there where some ok jokes the timing where off.I had hoped for better but it just goes to show a good cast does not mean a good movie.
613,"I really wanted to like this movie. The overall plot was enjoyable but the execution was terrible. It felt slow and rushed all at the same time. It was a bit nonsensical at parts with how it was jumping around. It seemed like most of the actors were trying to speak in a funny voice, which just made it not funny. I was in a pretty packed theater and there was almost no laughter, even from the children.CGI was amazing, and it it had been done differently I think the movie would have been great."
614,"The idea of Robert Downey Jr in a light-hearted comedy featuring talking animals seems like fun. Sadly, there's something missing. Younger kids might enjoy the chaos on screen but RDJ's role is not as good as you might imagine.
I'm a Welshman, and many of my fellow countrymen and women were very surprised to lear that he's attempting a Welsh accent in this film.
In actual fact, the dialogue you hear is a passable Welsh accent, but it's clear that there were problems - you get the sense that all of RDJ's dialogue has been overdubbed in post - it's edited to avoid him talking for any longer than a sentence.Here's what I think happened: The test audiences either didn't understand his accent, or it was pretty bad as filmed, so they did an extensive re-dub, and made every attempt to NOT show his mouth for most of his lines.
By the halfway point of the movie, there's a few scenes that are narrated by the parrot, which is often a sign of a movie that has had a lot cut out of it. The parrot provides the exposition to help you understand what's going on.Much as I love him, Downey should've just gone back to his natural US accent or even his 'Sherlock' English accent, because this Welsh one is always delivered in a very fast surprised whisper, which doesn't seem to fit the situations he's in. I suppose he wanted to avoid being seen as Tony Stark in this film, so he picked the Welsh accent as a challenge. I have a feeling that most American audiences will be asking for subtitles.I know he's the big star, but I can't help feeling that his co-star Michael Sheen, being Welsh, would've done a much better job.The animals are very forgettable - none of the celebrity names really fit their animal avatars - Rami Malek as a gorilla? But Emma Thompson and Tom Holland as parrot and dog respectively are the only ones that seem to do okay.Sorry Robert, but I think as soon as word spreads, this film will do little at the box office. Ouch, that was facetious. Eddie Murphy's Dolittle looks like a triumph in comparison."
615,"This movie is terrible. there really isn't much to say. i got nothing out of this movie, zero entertainment value. the only reason i didn't give it a 1/10 is because, while there was plenty of dumbness, it wasn't egregious. it wasn't filled with things you can make fun of, it didn't shock me or make me yell omg.it wasn't horrible, it was just... nothing. not nearly as bad as some of the absolute garbage i watched in the past month (like a boss, verotika, outbreak, loqueesha, first love, countdown, the replacements, the fanatic, deep impact, black christmas, all 1/10... omg i watch way too many bad movies)..........i usually don't like changing my rating after watching reviews, but this specific case is different. i already said this movie did nothing for me. but i originally gave it a 2/10 because there weren't that many horrible things in it. i think i just checked out pretty early on so i didn't notice them. not that i wasn't paying attention, i watched the whole thing, albeit mostly on fast speed. but i think i just knew it was bad early on and stopped judging everything, just expecting it to be garbage.but the reviews reminded me of so many things i forgot about, and pointed out so many things i didn't even pay attention to. basically everything that happened in the story was useless. so many characters and random story points were immediately abandoned, i just forgot about them until the reviews.it also explained why i felt the way i did about a few things. for one, i couldn't believe the RDJ brought NOTHING to the table. he's a great actor, not just as tony stark. but the reviews pointed out that there were so many reshoots and rewrites and changes that so many of the scenes of him speaking did not show his face or lips moving. they dubbed over scenes with the rewritten dialogue. and because we don't see his face so often, his performance comes close to disappearinganother thing the reviews explained is why i didn't feel like this movie about talking animals had anything to do with talking animals. it's because they weren't conversations. almost everything the animals said were one liners that didn't even fit the moment half the time. it was just like these famous actors would say random lines and insert them at random points in the movie.bottom line, this movie is incompetent (1 viewing, 5/31/2020)"
616,"This film start with an animation introduction of ""Dr. Dolittle"", and a girl ""Lady Rose"" visit him scene! As turnout, this film is about Dr. Dolittle need to find the fruit at Eden Tree Island to cure Queen Victoria! He also need to dealing with the threat by Dr. Blair along the way! Entire film full of overuse of the playing dumb, and annoying arguing scene! Make the film unwatchable! Barely intense scene is, the gorilla fighting with the tiger! Barely laughable scene is, the polar bear slapping the ostrich to wake it up! At the end, Dr. Dolittle successfully obtain the fruit from Eden Tree Island to cure Queen Victoria! Still have a post credit scene! Myriad of bats attacking Dr. Blair! That's it! Another big letdown!"
617,I dont support animal violence even if its made by computerThey have fell to impress meVery bad movie
618,"Before watching the movie, I first saw the IMDB reviews and they were all pretty bad, but I decided to be more positive and actually was kind of excited to watch the movie.Maybe around 10-20 minutes into the movie, the horrible reviews suddenly made so much sense, the really bad story, the bad acting, and just horrible horrible accent by RDJ. Maybe he already made too much money from Ironman and MCU and just stopped caring.Not recommended at all.
Story - 1/10"
619,"This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. It's trying to be like Lord of the Rings and on the other trying to be treasure island or something. The movie lost me when the SPOILERS dragon appeared. The plot was mediocre: as a kids magical fantasy adventure movie would be. But by having a narrator type of character to narrate parts of the movie, it takes away the magic of the process of adventurous. It's sort of breaking the rule of ""Show don't tell"". I really wish they could show more of the adventure at sea and really doing some adventuring. The Collet boy character (whose name is not catchy nor memorable at all) is kinda useless. He is just there for plot convenience and for the younger audience members I guess. Lady Rose's actor's acting is not that great: it's like she's trying to be Heromine or something. Lastly, Robert Downey Jr's voice often gives me a feeling like it was dubbed over. It was very distracting.However, I really like the idea and story of Dolittle and enjoy a lot of the world building of the movie like the whale pulling the ship thing. Yet it lost a lot of charm by having mediocre villains, unrewarded plot lines and abrupt character developments like Lily's dad's redemption. To be frank, I can see the appeal to this movie for kids. Nowadays, it's really rare for this kind of genre. It reminds me of the Narnia movies. But I don't think this movie is made for me or my type of audience. So if you like a not so serious, kinda funny but not really adventure movie then this is for you."
620,"From Dan Slentz of Reel Tunez.. The Radio Show All About the Movies...Dolittle ""did little"" for me.The problem with high expectations is being let down, and admittedly I had high hopes. It's a great old story, and digital effect (CGI) can be awesome. Then add to the fact that it has one of (what I consider) to be the best actors in film today, and this was a ""Reel"" let down!Here's the problem. The story development was hideously week. Right away there's a death, and without any development all it produced was a ""that's a shame"". The story throughout the entire movie was VERY weak at best, and Downey seemed to have very crappy direction. Was Downey good? Of course! But even an great actor won't carry a crappy story. It should also be noted that the CGI (especially the Fox) was NOT great... and the soundtrack to this movie was phenomenally wimpy.. nearly non-existent! A part of the ""shame"" on that is they actually were working with an actor who could sing, so HAD they made it a lot more like a modern version of the original Rex Harrison film, it probably COULD have been awesome!The kid that played the apprentice to Dolittle was good.. and most of the animal voices were good, but this had the ""thrill"" of a made-for-TV movie. On a 1-10 scale, I'd give barely give this a 5... barely. If it had anyone other than Robert Downey Jr., probably a 4."
621,"Not funny at all. An inconsistant story made up by people who think bringing together a few cute looking, well designed (I'll give them that) computer animals, must be good enough for at least entertaining kids. Well, it isn't! For adults and kids alike it's just boring, boring, boring, waiting for the fun to start, which never happens. A single smile, one half touching sigh and that's it. What a total bummer this movie was, a complete waste of time and money."
622,"Like almost every movie in its genre, it is incoherent. Furthermore, I believe that there were not may efforts put in this movie, you can easily believe what I,m saying by a simple look to the costume or the visual effects, but it is even more appearing when you watch the movie and notice all those cliché that they made. I can't really blame the actors for that since they have done their best in the circumstances, but that movie really seem to me low budget a cash collector."
623,"I'm rating six cause my wife stayed and this was her rating, however I had to leave and watch something else it was boring to me and Roberts character was not like able to me...I would've rated it 3/10 from what I saw cause the squirrel was funny."
624,"So a lot of people are rating this a 10/10, and while part of me wants to think it's studio bots, some of the other reviews indicate it's people whose best compliment is ""well my kids liked it"". If your main intent is merely to entertain your kids then save yourself some money and have them watch Spongebob or take them to the park, for free. You don't need to risk them losing brain cells over this creatively-void monstrosity.
All of RDJ's scenes feel like they were done on the first take, and his attempt at a swashbuckler accent is annoying as hell. We know this man can do better. None of his animal companions look like they're in the same universe as him, let alone the same room, and this hack CGI job is even more baffling when you learn the budget for this movie was $175 million. The story? Non-engaging to say the least: the conflict rests entirely on saving some queen who has been asleep the whole time by finding the tree Dolittle's long-lost wife (also absent from the action) was after. Good thing the script tells us these women are important to him, because we sure as hell don't see it. The animals all have names, but since the screenwriter forgot to write a character for them, I promise you won't remember what they are.
Obviously, the main intent of the studio was just to cram as many celebrities into this thing as possible. The voice cast runs the Hollywood gamut from Ralph Fiennes to John Cena, but any semblance of charm or acting ability goes out the window when said voices consist of cringey jokes coming out the lips of a fake polar bear. Vulture's critic was right in calling this ""anti cinema""; it is a bad movie and I got secondhand shame from watching it."
625,If I stood outside the theater and told you that the climax of this movie revolves around Dr Dolittle having to pull bagpipes out of a dragon's anus would you believe me? Well if that sort of thing interests you then I'm sure you'll find this movie a real hoot and a half. If it doesn't than you will be sorely disappointed. The writer of Call of Duty: Ghosts does a bang up job directing this movie. And by bang up job I of course mean that he banged up the career's of every actor/actress that was cast in this movie. It's bad.
626,"No, it's not Oscar worthy. But, movies for the whole family seldom are. When is the last time a movie that appeals to the family won an Oscar? Yes it's silly but that's what we need from time to time. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would."
627,"I think that movie is really underrated I mean guys come on why didn't you like that exactly
despite RDJ's welsh accent because simply that doesn't matter the story still isn't so good and that's why I give it 8 out of 10"
628,How is it possible that you take such a list of great actors and make such an atrocious movie? Wow this was bad
629,Way better than was expected don't understand the bad reviews! I thought they did a great job with re inventing the Dolittle franchise!!
630,This is good family fun. Great for littler ones. Nothing wrong with it. Cute. Well acted. Great messages. Slapstick enough without being too ridiculous.We loved it.The cast was tops.
631,Yeah Its was good and amazing and cool and with tony Stark and THAT beer
632,Wonderful movie for the whole family. Robert Downey Jr. brought to life a beloved character. Lots of laughter and smiles.
633,"Colourful, action-packed, well-scripted and most importantly kind... what else do people want from a kids' movie? Anyone who gave it a negative review has obviously forgotten what it's like to be a child. Don't listen - if you'd like old-fashioned adventure with brilliant cast and kind-hearted story, go for it: this film is for you!"
634,"This is the most boring, poorly acted, poorly written, atrocious movie I've had the displeasure of watching in the theater. I don't want to continue talking about this mess of a movie for long, so I won't. Just stay away from this movie at all costs. This movie is so bad that cats looks cute compere to this."
635,This film was brilliant. I love how the boy ended up being able to talk to animals just like Dolittle. It was a fun adventure film with a villain. RDJ did a very good job as Dr Dolittle.
636,"This is funny, goofy, and the picture movie to watch with your family. Corny humor, over the top action, and silly antics. Everything you would expect from a family film with talking animals. It kept our multi-generational house giggling from the get go, and I plan to watch it again with all my nieces and nephews. The hateful reviews make no sense. This movie is exactly what you expect from a film with TALKING ANIMALS. Those with angry reviews appear to have struggled getting in touch with their inner child. ;)"
637,"IT IS A MOVIE ABOUT A MAN WHO TALKS TO ANIMALS! What did you people expect? Anyway, I loved it. Thought it was a great family movie. Ticks all the boxes for me. Fun, adventurous, perfect amount of humor without trying too hard. Held everyone I saw the film witch's attention. The CGI was exactly what I thought I'd get from a movie about A MAN WHO TALKS TO ANIMALS. Seriously this is a great, fun, & family flick. If you have kids it is a must."
638,"Popcorn all over the world has the same taste, and iron man is no exception."
639,"This is an awesome fun and loving family movie really don't understand why people give a bad review
Its awsome CGI and great vocal on the animals .."
640,I really detest this movie. I can't even imagine that Robert did this stupid role!
641,"The cast is really impressive. But that's it!The rest of the film isn't great. For a start the visuals are awful (despite something like a $100 million budget), the story is unoriginal and by-the-numbers as well as an overload of unnecessary characters. I believe that half of them didn't need to be in the film or could be morphed with another character.One thing that I disagree with critics on is the humour. Some- not all, but some -of the jokes worked and my family and I laughed a few times. Just a shame the rest of the film is such a dud."
642,"As a Welsh person, I was completely prepared to be outraged at RDJ's Welsh accent, but on the whole, I was pleasantly surprised! It was great to hear Welsh colloquialisms performed so well, and I admire the decision not to produce a film with yet another bland and generic upper class English accent. All in all, this is a great family film that kids will love. Oh, and the whales have a Welsh accent too, which pretty much made my day!"
643,"Dr. Dolittle (Robert Downey, Jr.) has suffered the loss of his most beloved mate and he has gone to utter ruin. The royal zoo where he cares for animals is still limping along but the doctor has grown a long beard and won't doctor anyone else. Most have even forgotten that he is where he is. But, a royal lass comes calling for his help as her grandmother, The Queen, is being poisoned and needs a medicine from far away. Also visiting with her is an orphan boy who needs direction and aid. After much hesitation and complaining, Dr. Dolittle commits to a voyage to the remote island where this one medicine is to be found. Or so he believes. Meanwhile, a hateful aid to the Queen (Michael Sheen) wants to stop this from happening, as he will be in power should the Queen die. So, he also gets on a boat and follows Dolittle on this long, long voyage. Will the heroes find the medicine and save the Royal Lady? This beautiful film, with art direction, costumes, and settings, gets better as it goes along. Therefore, families, stick with it during the slow opening until they all go aboard! Based on the Voyages of Doctor Dolittle by Hugh Lofting, the story is very intriguing and exotic. One major quibble was found by me. The cast is very nice, with Sheen and Antonio Banderas doing great work. But, how, how could Downey Jr. , one of the finest actors anywhere, take on this accent that makes his lines all but incomprehensible! Its still a mystery to me because it hampers his performance in a huge fashion. Nevertheless, do much to get Dolittle into the view machine and delight your families and friends."
644,Fantastic Adventure movie. Really enjoyed John Cena's voice for yoshi character. The Squirrel character steals everyone heart. Robert Downey Jr & Antonio Banderas First time onscreen presence was enjoyable. Can enjoy this movie family & kids. Waiting for the second sequel
645,"It's a great pity that they didn't research the locations and the Queens English, it's absolutely riddled with Inaccurate scenes and dialogue. It's supposed to be set in England, believe it or not. Just for kids"
646,"So.... NOT ONLY can Dolittle speak with animals, but other random people too? What's the point of having a movie where the entire premise is supposed to be this one amazing guy who speaks to animals, if every Tom, Dick and Harry can speak to animals too? It's such a poor premise.Also, on the EXACT date that Dolittle receives a surprise summons from Buckingham Palace (from a young girl, of all things), a random young boy just HAPPENS to stumble upon Dolittle's house on that exact same day? The chances of that happening is highly, highly unlikely and just too convenient of a plot-device. It's honestly poor writing right from the get-go, since the entire story is based upon an unlikelihood. This is a VERY 'Disney' thing to do, as Disney just loves to play off the romantic naivete of young viewers by putting a young girl & young boy together on-screen and showing them enjoy various adventures together while holding hands and giggling whilst sharing absolutely no on-screen romantic feelings whatsoever (yeah right!). That's classic Disney (even-though Disney doesn't have a hand in this film specifically).This movie simply DIDN'T need to be made... it's simply a cash-grab and an attempt to just make more money... I'm really glad that the studio lost money on this money, because hopefully they'll stop cranking out trash movies like this, solely for the purpose of making some cash. So in summation: This movie is bad. Only a 4 year old child would enjoy it."
647,Going to see the film is something I regret.This is a very boring and childish movie.I do not advise adults to watch it.
648,"Horrible, horrible, horrible.Either Robert isn't talking and his voice is dubbed by someone who hasn't any or Robert is whispering throughout the film. Why couldn't they make Dolittle an American guy so that this Robert could just be himself because he can't act? All he can do is show an attitude and that's why he was chosen for Iron man, isn't it? So depressing and irritating every time Robert opened his mouth. Every single time. The VFX was good though. Oh BTW, badly written too."
649,"First of all... I love good children movies. Snowtime\Racetime, Rise of the Guardians, Nut Job, the earlier Shrek\Ice Age movies, Madagascar, Ender's Game and probably many more I just can't get off the top of my head.
Sure, not all of them are in the same league, but they all have... characters, morale, they are lively, positive, cynical, antsy, but none of them feels like they were written for a .... ahem *cough*... very very stupid person. Because children are not stupid. They just don't see the whole picture yet. Our job as adults is to give them this picture, explain it and show them their place in it.This movie... has no such goals. There are only three movies that I can recently remember that I failed to watch to the end, and this is one of them. And, in fact, it's the worst. Or at least on par with another - Charlie's Angels(2019).
When the movie is so bad that the mere introduction makes you vomit an entire bucket - it's... not a good sign.I mean it - the first less than 5 minutes have painfully dull exposition, a lot of brainwashing and it all culminates into the introduction of a boy, who, to put it lightly, is ""not of this world"". I don't want my kids to be that way. I'm not sure why would anyone give such examples to their children. You are adults. You can afford to have a broader spectrum of reality. You aren't limited by your school bullies, homework and Fortnite. If you want examples of people treating animals well - show them excerpts from Kevin Richardson or any other adequate animal expert(but who am I kidding, nowadays parents would probably take their children to watch The Tiger King right after this Dolittle)...
And, to really, really, reeeeeally hammer that nail in, just one minute later the movie introduces us to RDJ's Dolittle. Look, I liked Radaghast's small role in Hobbit, it was niche, quirky and kind. And I do not take Eddie Murphy's talking to animals in English seriously, because it's no more serious than Marvel's Nick Fury speaking to every alien he meets for the first time in English, expecting it to understand. But this movie tries to make animal language be... animal language, yet it also mixes it with straight up English and it all looks... again, *cough* very very stupid.That was it. That's where I just regretted that I spent a few minutes of downloading this abomination. I can't imagine myself getting PAID to watch it. And I would consider taking kids to watch it as... *cough* bad parenting. *cough* Because if you treat or raise your kids as some ADHD ferrets... Then you should've just got a hamster and saved yourself the trouble.I can swallow bad child movies. Sonic the Edgehog, Deadpool Pikachu, Alladin LA, Lion King LA - there are plenty of modern Hollywood movies that deserve to be not just ""direct-to-dvd"", but merely ""Youtube-only"" timewasters. That people still pay to see in theaters, because reasons. These movies(not all of them) hold the reasonable 3-5 star rating in my book, I do not give 1 star reviews lightly. But if a movie is so bad that it makes you cringe as an adult and so bad that you'd want to keep your child as far away from it as possible - then what other rating can there be?And, I have spoiled myself the movie by watching the reviews - it doesn't get better. I hoped that someone would say ""yeah, the first few minutes are terrible(a sentiment expressed by a surprising large amount of reviews here), but it gets better"". It doesn't. It actually gets worse. So... if 50% reviews here say ""Don't get the negativity"" - my conclusion is ""Don't get the positivity"". There are plenty of PG13> movies out there that could at least try to be a story, to be about characters, at least somewhat. And stooping so low as to watch this... this literal mindless abomination... is not necessary.Ugh, if there's one good thing about this movie... it made me want to bingewatch Garfield. Somehow I got those vibes, and even that campy cult classic is just... worlds ahead of this ... latest actor paycheck."
650,"Rdj was great actor and we all seen him as a Iron man .In this movie the character was exactly opposite to Tony stark ,so some of them are complaining about this movie.In fact it has a great story and animation, but not get good reviews."
651,"I don't know why this adult reviewed the film so logicaly, Iam enjoying this movie more than you do. This remind me of my childhood movie. Bring me back the memory of some good 90's movie. This is a perfect movie for kids, if you want to see some heavy story movie you are at the wrong movie."
652,"This is one of the better all around family movies that I have watched in a while. Yes, it is a bit cheesy and fairly predictable but the characters and the story are just down right fun. It is true that there is no in depth character development but one has to remember it is primarily a kids' movie. It is full of quite a bit of silliness but again --- hello -- kids' movie. If you are in the mood for a clean, fun movie that spins a slightly different take on the classic, then grab your popcorn and enjoy"
653,"This may be the most poorly marketed movie in history. Early reviews appear to have been from a bunch of Marvel fans who came to this movie expecting to see Iron Man, perhaps because of the way it was marketed. Clearly, people with this mindset were disappointed, as were non-Marvel fan adults who expected to see a movie with humor that adults get but flies over the heads of their children.
This is a movie for children 10 and under, 13 on the outside.
The sets are excellent, the special effects are good, and the jokes are meant for children to laugh at, but not necessarily adults.
If you have something else to do and your children need a distraction, this is your movie."
654,"Despite being loyal to the original travel form, the screenplay of this movie is still somewhat scattered, and some sidelines are also shelved in Acts 2 and 3. In terms of narrative promotion, he still stayed in the ""Queen's Secret Order"" as a compulsory external cause, giving up the internal setting of the protagonist who lost his love. Throughout the adventure, Dorrit should have realized the transformation from passive to active, from pessimistic to optimistic, but after the journey officially began, Robert Downey Jr. quickly returned to being both unruly and rich in life experience The standardization of the design and continues to the end of the story."
655,"Positive:
Animation quality was good with roughly 870 digital artists, visual effects & animators at work on the critters.
Negatives:
Very money oriented formula, a seen all too often non-creative, typecasting of a disheveled, lost in remorse, character with very stereotyped withdrawn mannerisms.
More demographic viewer capture formula insertion of thin attractive teens with, of course, romantic interest.
The usual baddies. Stereotyped attractive queen being poisoned.
Script, voicing & behaviors of critters seemed superficial & forced trying to be contemporary cool. Lacked realism & emotion. Nothing original, lacked continuity. A poorly voiced dragon with a stomach ache?
Conclusion: Made for money w/all the standard hooks. Should have been magical, but just cute animated critters behaving like humans."
656,"Such amazing actors which made it funny but the movie was so fast-paced it was hard to understand the storyline, jumping from one scene to another. And what's with the British accent Robert ??? Couldn't understand a thing, might as well have kept your American accent like most of the actors... or animals I should say. Oh and on that note, how is it a British movie, based in Britain, with British Speaking humans but most of the animals have an American accent ??"
657,"We have all watched the Dolittle movies starring Eddie Murphy. I'm not going to lie, I was never a fan of these films. Yes, they're purposefully dumb, innocent, and feature that basic level of comedy. They never annoyed me, but they also never did anything remarkably surprising. 2020's version of the known tale is the first post-MCU role of Robert Downey Jr., it boasts an A-list cast, and... it's one of the worst movies of the year, without a single doubt. A complete disaster in every area of filmmaking.I don't even know where to start. Maybe with RDJ since he's the most significant negative surprise. I can't believe such a charismatic and now iconic actor like him could deliver a performance this awful. His Welsh (?) accent is not only a terrible choice character-wise, but I doubt that any children can understand what he's saying. RDJ acts like a baffling caricature of himself, not helping an already flawed film. The voice work from the remaining cast might be the only positive of the whole movie, but the CGI animals are way too unconvincing.However, as always, the most impactful issues belong to the actual story. Instead of being an entertaining and fun adventure, it's an incredibly boring, nonsensical, structure-less journey into one of the most ridiculous third acts of cinema. Even placing myself in a child's mind, I don't think I would be able to enjoy this mess of a screenplay. Like I wrote above, not even the animals look great...
Certain characters possess these unknown relationships that the audience is supposed to care about, but no background is given to any of them. Tons of plot points lack a logical explanation. The entire narrative is void of any creativity or uniqueness whatsoever, looking simply like a lazy, unimaginative piece of work. The ""young queen who falls gravely ill"" is just a woman sleeping in bed, not looking ill at all, which proves that not even the makeup department was interested in making an effort.But all of the issues above are nothing compared to the film's climax. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just write that I still can't believe what I witnessed. Around ninety minutes of build-up lead to the most shocking, hilarious, utterly absurd moment. The humor is a level below childish. Dozens of fart jokes (including one during the climax), over-the-top reactions, and I don't even know what else. Between Bloodshot, Fantasy Island, and The Grudge... Let the devil come and choose!
All in all, Dolittle is a massive fail at all levels. It was meant to be one of the worst movies of the year, and it undoubtedly accomplished this goal. From the surprisingly awful performance from Robert Downey Jr. to one of the most shockingly terrible climaxes in the history of cinema, Stephen Gaghan delivers a structure-less screenplay, filled with nonsensical narrative decisions, and featuring an extremely dull adventure. The CGI animals are far from being remotely impressive, the characters lack personality (bringing an A-list actor doesn't guarantee anything), and the comedy is so astonishingly basic that I doubt kids will laugh at some of the jokes, and they laugh at everything. With a budget of 175M (!!!), it's not understandable how and why a studio would waste this much money on such an obvious flop. The voice work from the cast is good... and it genuinely could have been worse. This is the closest I can get to a positive.Rating: D-"
658,"I first saw the trailer in the cinema and couldn't wait to watch the movie. So I was heartily disappointed when I did.I love Robert Downey Junior. He was the heart of the Marvel universe, and he had a fantastic list of actors to work with again in this movie. However, the production crew fluffed it.Ok credit to the CGI crew, they did a pretty decent job on the animals, they worked really well for the most part.Everything else feel flat. The scripts were embarrassingly badly written. Nothing clever at all, a completely lazy narrative.The editing is terrible. Nothing flows. The whole movie jumps about all over the place like a cheap cartoon. There's no depth, no feeling, no ambience in any scene. You can't fall into the movie, just watch awkwardly from the outside.My biggest disappointment was the sound. Robert Downey did something I detest in movies these days, that I've never seen him do before... He mumbled. So many lines passed by that I couldn't understand. I get the accent, I'm Welsh, it wasn't as bad as some, but it was mumbled so badly it couldn't be heard.The music too, another part of the sound throughout the movie, was lazy and added nothing to the story or ambience.I spent so long waiting for this movie, then spent at least an hour waiting for it to finish.This could, or at least should, have become a modern classic. But it won't. It will be forgotten within a year. Sadly."
659,"Potentially great viewing for under-fives and life-long stoners, but anyone with a developed brain will spend the entirety of this ordeal reaching for the barf bucket."
660,"I don't understand how a movie with such a high budget and many great actors can be so lame. How could anyone have thought this was a good script?
I didn't care about any character because there was no real depth or development to any. The story in itself was without interest or twist.
I love children's movies but this one was awful. I've seen low budget B-movies with better CGI and a better script.
Even RDJ, that I love, was irritating with that clearly fake accent, out of sync with the cgi acting and that weird way he played that character, like a theater character rather than a movie one. As a result, I didn't care or empathized with his character at all.
The kid's story is phoned in. In fact every character could totally diseappear from the story and I feel like it wouldn't really change anything because no one is important, it's all a mess of characters without backstory, purpose or importance.Worst movie I've seen in a while. It makes you wonder if they knew that with a cast like this they were going to make money anyway, so they didn't even try to make it good."
661,"Just boring as simple as, as bore it gets lol, even after couple drinks still oh lord get it over with already"
662,"Wow, this is bad. What's up with his voice, it's like it's been edited and dubbed over. Mostly CG movie for little kids."
663,"It's a movie for family. Animals are fun !
I'm a bit disappointed by Downey's performance."
664,"It's robert Downey movie.
It's kid movie.
It's a good movie with Weird accent.
That's all i got.
My advice is to watch a dubbed version.
The english version sucks."
665,"For me it never works when animals talk. Only when it's an full animation movie. Maybe children like it. For me it did not unfortunately. There where 2 things ""funny"" that was jeff. And the operation of D."
666,"Choppy and incoherent at best. Downey's accent is painful to suffer through and the entire movie felt like it was directed by six people, simultaneously who couldn't agree on anything.There is however some mild comic relief from the supporting cast of voice actors but just too infrequent to make the movie tolerable."
667,"Its not the worst movie. I'm not into that hyperbole of ""worst movie I've ever seen"" nonsense, but this movie was not great. Most of my issues rise from a script and flow standpoint. The script jumped around too much and felt disjointed. It also relied too much on convenience and I also felt too may things were left unexplained. All that said, is it good for kids? Absolutely, but it lacks the punch that will keep most adults engrossed as well."
668,"To be honest I like the original one better, with Eddy Murphy, but this one was not bad either. It's a perfect fun for a family movie night. It's a tale with excitement and laughter in it, so.. enjoy! :)"
669,"It isn't a bad movie I went with low expectancies so it was a good surprise to me, it's a good family afternoon film to watch in the weekend and an innocent adventure so don't go to see it thinking that is going to be much, you just sit down to watch and relax. The CG animals some are ok and others not that much."
670,"Most of the hate I see for this film is from the fact that it doesn't compare to the original dolittle movie, and I agree, but it's like comparing a fish and a giraffe. They are completely different films. This movie is not a ripoff of the original, it is a completely different take on the character. The only similarity is a doctor that talks to animals, but other than that it is just an adventure film with animals so it's just fun. It's a simple story, but I have some soft spot in my heart for fantasy adventure films for some reason, so I could appreciate the cool settings and striking characters like Antonio Banderas' character. Kids will love it, I loved it, I just had to walk into the theatre doing my best to not compare it to the original Dr. Dolittle. Were it called anything else, we would not be seeing this amount of negative reviews."
671,"Dr. John Dolittle lives in solitude behind the high walls of his lush manor in 19th-century England. His only companionship comes from an array of exotic animals that he speaks to on a daily basis. But when young Queen Victoria becomes gravely ill, the eccentric doctor and his furry friends embark on an epic adventure to a mythical island to find the cure.This movie is terrible, terrible comedy, terrible acting, terrible dialogue, terrible pacing and just a terrible movie.I'm gonna start off with acting, Robert Downey Jr sucked, everyone sucked they all put on these old British accents and they just felt comical and completely fake.This is a kids movie but i can't see a kid finding this movie good, it was boring. The plot follows the same formula, Dr Dolittle goes to a location and gets surrounded by a threat but somehow he talks his way out of it. It's just boring.The comedy was very stale, just overusing weak childish jokes that don't land and just feel uncomfortable.I'm telling you to not waste your money or time with this movie. It is horrible.Grade: F"
672,"I don't understand the reason of so many negative reviews. For me, it's the good family film with ordinary script. RDJ is very good (as usually). Another characters (actually, most of them are animals) are very interesting, because they have different individual characteristics, for example, polar bear with fear of cold. Visual effects are awesome. Music is used for completing the atmosphere of the fim."
673,"I was hoping the movie to be better than this. This movie really is for kids. As an adult, I did not enjoy it one bit. I watch a lot of sci-fi/fantasy movies and this was solely made for kids."
674,"Loved this film, thought it was a great family film and a new version of an old story. The animals were great."
675,"I'm a little late when it comes to watching Dolittle, so I went in after hearing for several weeks about how bad the film is. So, did I find it as bad as everyone else? Yes, pretty much. That's not to say that there weren't any redeeming qualities, because there were, but they were few and far between.First of all, Robert Downey Junior isn't good in Dolittle. He isn't exactly bad, but his accent was off and the performance didn't live up to what we know he can bring to a role. Some of his interactions with the animals were nice and funny, but most of them were painfully cringy.That brings me around to the screenplay. Every line of dialogue felt forced, and the plot came across like it was thrown together by a bunch of eight-year-olds. Again, there wasn't anything particularly terrible about the storyline, but it was extremely generic and painfully predictable. Apart from a few moments, it was the dialogue that brought the film down.The cinematography was occasionally excellent, but the overall direction was very poor and the action, when it happened, was sloppily filmed. There was no characterisation at all, and everyone finished the film in the exact same place they started. For the journey they went on, it would have been nice to see a little character development.Overall, Dolittle wasn't a film for me, but I could see how very young children would be entertained by it. If we do get a sequel, which I very much doubt, I hope it's a significant step up from this.SCORE: 32%"
676,"Movies like this are what happens when there's no one to say ""no"". They're listless; no one wanted to say anything with this work (or script anyway); it's just about ticking checkboxes: animals - yes, constant noisy, busy action - yes, big name stars - yes. It's good to see a formulaic, soulless approach fail yet again."
677,"Didn't expect much but the movie was worser.
Humor is for 2-6 years old kids. The young guy was acting so terrible, it seems for me, that a Scheich or another investor wants this movie to let his son acting a leading role - it was so bad, unbelievable.
The plot was below average and not interesting. Downey Jr. and Banderas were only a (small) highlight.
I was surprised to see those both actors in such a bad movie."
678,"The oddest part of this for me was RDJ dubbing his own voiceover! I understand why they felt they should do it, but the sound is wrong"
679,"This movie couldn't decide what it was trying to do, and if I had seen it as a kid, I would have enjoyed it. The problem is that it's just another massed produced production with little thought. Any kid who watches it now will be disappointed and rewatch it in the future and see how poorly made it is."
680,"I'm truly not even sure where to start with this one. While I admittedly haven't read any of the children's books or seen the original film from 1967, I quite enjoyed Eddie Murphy's rendition of Dr. Dolittle in 1998 and I enjoyed the 2001 sequel even more. That series went on for far too long, but they were harmless family films. Now, Robert Downey Jr. has taken the mantle as the latest to portray this character and while it seems as though everyone involved was trying to make something special, this is a prime example of all the pieces just not working as a whole. Kids may find some visual enjoyment at times, but this is a very weak film, and here's why.Dolittle picks up years after the events that lead him to isolation when a young boy and his crew of animals (who he often speaks to) embark on a journey to an island that has a flower that can save the life of the Queen. There were multiple times where I found myself wondering who this movie was meant for. Yes, the journey itself and the animals (which all look incredibly fake by the way) will provide some eye candy for young kids, but the premise will bore them to no end. Adults probably won't find themselves invested, as the plot is so thin, to begin with. Dolittle does nothing to impress throughout its entire 100-minute run time.The most frustrating part about this film is that the narration is so descriptive and on the nose that it makes you feel dumb. It's even used in places in order to explain how characters would go from place to place, which felt like it was an easy way to explain 10 minutes of the plot away instead of filming a couple more sequences. On top of that, this film begins with a bit of animation, showcasing how Dr. Dolittle made it to the point in his life that he is throughout this film, but the story beats that are brushed over are far more interesting than anything that happened throughout the course of this movie. His backstory that was explained away would've made for a much more engaging premise, so I felt slightly annoyed that the best stuff was left out.Sure, I'll give credit where credit is due. Quite honestly, I couldn't care less about who is voicing a CGI animal/person/creature in a film, simply because it won't usually make a movie any better or any worse. With that said, from Rami Malek to Ralph Fiennes, the list of talent is endless here. The reason I'm bringing this up is that the highlight of the film for me was actually the Ostrich Plimpton, voiced by Kumail Nanjiani. Although he doesn't get a lot to do, his voice work had me cracking up throughout the movie, as he muttered many things about events happening in front of him. It didn't happen very often, but I got a few laughs out of his work.In the end, this is a journey that really goes nowhere and the best part about the movie is Dr. Dolittle's backstory, which is brushed over in the first few minutes. Robert Downey Jr. is trying very hard to give kids a wacky character to get behind, but it just didn't work for me. I love him as an actor, but this was one of his oddest choices for a character ever. Michael Sheen probably has the best moment in the film as the main villain, as his hammy performance would've had me rolling on the floor laughing if he had more screen time, but I bet he has about 5 minutes total if I were to go back and count. Dolittle has a few promising elements but is ultimately an ugly, joyless adventure film that I just can't recommend."
681,"Dr. Dolittle can talk to animals, he is a depressed recluse, and he needs to sail to a secret island to recover an antidote to save The Queen of England who is terminally ill.Action fantasy adventure aimed at a young target audience.
CGI heavy movie featuring base level humour, I laughed a few times but found really boring, though the 9 year-old granddaughter liked it.R.D.JUNIOR was completely miscast to play Dr. Dolittle, this role really should have been J. DEPP"
682,"I was really looking forward to this film.One of the worst films I have seen. Three stars given for the cast, nothing else."
683,Started out very good but mid point turned very boring
684,"Man did I want to love this movie but sadly I didn't which really disappoints me because this movie had a lot of potential. Now is this movie complete trash, no it's not there is some good in this movie from the 2 child actors who do an actual really good job in this movie, and the cast that plays the animals easily steal the show. The cgi animals also are really well made to and look really life like. But sadly that's all the good in this movie. The rest of the cast in this movie suck which sucks because there is some great actors in this movie for example Robert Downey jr is in this movie and he plays an complete jerk in this movie, your supposed to be cheering John Dolittle on but each time he is on screen he does something that makes you hate him even more. The villain in this movie is complete and other trash and his motive is so clichéd. The story in this movie is really bad and at times makes no sense at all. The movie is also all over the place and sometimes it doesn't know where it wants to go. The pacing in this movie also is just so slow the movie feels like it's dragging on at some scenes. The Score in this movie is really bad and probably one of the weakest scores I have ever heard in my life. Overall, I was really disappointed with Dolittle, yes there is some pros in this movie but they can't save this movie in the end."
685,"I liked ""Dolittle"", although at some point I fell asleep. I mean, the movie is charming, cute and enjoyable, but it's not a masterpiece. This movie matches the quality of the previous installments with Eddie Murphy, however, it has serious problems with the editing and the connection of the scenes. The actors do fine, its soundtrack is good as well, but most of the jokes are unfunny and I wouldn't describe these almost 2 hours as comedy. ""Paddington"", ""Christopher Robin"" and ""Peter Rabbit"" are definitely much better, ""Dolittle"" is a good family film, but not one that I would watch twice."
686,"This is a fun movirle for kids. adults can enjoy this, too.
people complaining its bad: how is a movie that bad that you rate it 1 star? stop your imdb account until you learn movies and be decent about them."
687,It was a very delightful Movie Family Oriented.. Robert Downey jr. is very good. I don't know why it Bomb at the box office
688,"I have no idea why there is so much hatred for this movie, it was hilarious, heart-warming and magical with fantastic special effects and a superb cast. The cinema was full and judging from everyone's reactions very well enjoyed by all. Ignore the negative reviews and enjoy escaping from reality for a while!"
689,"A must see, good wholesome family movie! I thought RDJ was amazing and I am not a huge fan. The variety of characters was fantastic & well thought out. My 5 year old and 2 nieces aged 8 & 10 were glued to the screen! That was a massive accomplishment with these three high energy girls! They gave it a big thumbs up! My husband, and I had a couple good chuckles and thought it was fun and creative. It was kid captivating and friendly and that is what makes parents happy!"
690,Very much a kids movie with a focus on basic-level silly humour and CGI animals.
691,"It has its flaws and it has some terrible cgi and vfx, some of the poorest i can remember, and the poor sound quality in the dialouges are itching pretty bad when watching. some of the acting are pretty lame and uninspiringly overexcecuted, espescially the child actors have a hang to that.what we all seem to forget though is that this is a funny rumpledunk folly feels fine kinda childrens story, and this childishness shall shine through from a story like this. this the makers has done brilliantlyotherwise its allright and the grumpy old ones had a cosy time in the bench, so its still a recommend"
692,"This movie is perfect and entertaining for families who are big fans of talking animals. I'm glad that famous actors RDJ and Tom Holland are in that movie. The CGI animation and an animation from the beginning story are brilliant. To me, this movie is much funnier, better, and adventurous than the Eddie Murphy's Dr. Dolittle, but I still like Eddie. This movie looks like Disney's CGI animated movies, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and Pirates of the Caribbean, even though Dolittle is made by Universal Studios. Whoever disliked this movie are big fans of drama/horror movies. Come on, this is a family comedy movie. Everyone should watch Dolittle. It's the cutest, funniest, and beautiful movie I've ever watched. If I was a critic of family movies, I would give this one a grade ""A""."
693,I love the animals and their ways of thinking in Dolittle. That's enough with me :D
694,Quite fun for families with children. Especially kids that love animals. But the whole story very predictable and boring at times. Still worth the watch mostly to entertain the kids.
695,"There seems to be a very small niche that this movie should target and I have no idea where it is. The CGI is high quality, the action is good, the acting is great, and the story is... Meh. If you start digging deep you'll probably go crazy, but if you're a child or bringing a child, you should be... Ok? There are some weird moments (yes related to butts), and while it doesn't get graphic, it may as well have. There are also questionable parenting practices or lack thereof, but just see this and go have some fun."
696,"Guess who just went to the movies! Guess who just saw a really bad movie! Dolittle is a boring, predictable movie that is thankfully only an hour and fourty minutes long. The story is cleché, the plot that is all over the place, the third act feels rushed, the jokes are horrible, and actor was more like an animal than the actual animals. The only good thing to come from this movie was the CGI. The CGI animals were really smooth and full of life, unlike the rest of the movie. I guess it's fine for little kids, the kids in the theater enjoyed it just fine and if you enjoyed it, good for you, but if you're an adult looking for a good time, I suggest you stay far away from this animal !"
697,"If you think the original ""The Voyage of Doctor Dolittle"" bombed so hard (almost sank 20th Century Fox from Bankruptcy), then look no further than Dolittle, a property nobody asked for. Shame on you, Universal. This film is going to lose a ton of money (as I'm writing this review), but it's better than CATS (Also losing money) because the actors are great, the CGI and humor was unacceptable. This film should've been great if it wasn't for the reshoots snatched in and pretend this is a family-friendly movie. Saw the movie and guess what... it sucked. By gawd, what are they thinking? Robert Downey Jr. just already ended his incredible run as Iron Man in last year's Mastodon ""Avengers: Endgame"" and now your giving him a big paycheck thanks to this? It's been almost 6 years since he made a lead role, and by that, I mean ""The Judge"" (great movie, but nobody saw it). Universal is no stranger to failed IP's and you can add ""Dolittle"" along with ""The Mummy"" and it's Ill-begotten Dark Universe, ""The Wolfman,"" ""Land of the Lost,"" and ""Cowboys and Aliens."" BBottom Line: For Fans of Dr. Dolittle and it's underrated sequel (the Eddie Murphy version), I suggest you have Disney+ and find it. By the way, I'm pissed that Disney is getting rid of the ""FOX"" in name only. Thanks Disney. Now we aren't gonna hear the iconic John Williams theme music anymore."
698,"I was expecting a lot more out of this script, especially with its lineup of stars. Every turn was predictable leaving me wanting for much more. The visuals are wonderful, I almost forgot CGI could be this good ""looking at you Cats"". If you have some extra time on your hand and low expectations, give it a go you'll be throughly amused."
