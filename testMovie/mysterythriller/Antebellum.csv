0,"It's not your typical scary movie, but it certainly depicts real life horror. I knew going into the movie not to trust the reviews. I've often found that movies made by African-Americans about African-Americans and played by African-Americans upset a certain segment of the United States population and those individuals are very vocal and tend to write nasty reviews. So, I knew this would be no different. As the movie progressed, I saw why those particular individuals were salty. You'll see reviews that say this is ""fear mongering"" or creating racial tensions (as if they didn't already exist). One review even said it misrepresents the past. These reviews are laughable and quite disingenuous.If you're not among the salty population, then you may just enjoy this. But, and let's be honest here, if you believe the confederate flag is a symbol of your heritage, you're going to be salty AF watching this."
1,"Movie was borderline boring, predictable, i enjoyed the Trailers but so i should give credit to the people who marketed this movie more than the Producers and writers.. they did they thing pushing this garbage..
If you have ABSOLUTELY nothing else to watch on TV this might be something to have on playing in the background while your doing something else..Janelle did the best she could with her role in this movie, that's the only take away."
2,"Antebellum is a new horror thriller directed, written and produced in part by Gerard Bush and Christopher Renze. This is only their first real cinema film that they have directed together. For this they have made more short films, especially music video clips.The film is about the successful writer Veronica Henley (Janelle Monáe). She is confronted with her success by the world. She must fight the dark past and escape it before it's too late.The fact that this is the first cinema film that Gerard Bush and Christopher Renze have made is reflected in the film. The film seems to start with a clear beginning, but the plot twists that emerge later in the film only get messier and unclear. The story of the movie is somewhat like an adapted, copied version of the story of the movie Get Out. The few minor horror aspects of the movie seem to have been copied from the movie The Shining. The movie poster of this movie is even copied from the movie poster of The Silence of the Lambs.Despite the fact that the film does not have an original story, they try to incorporate a good message that responds to the current events of Black Lives Matter. This message would have come across better with a clearer script. For a better film that responds to the same current events, you better look back at Get Out. Instead of a scary horror film, the film also comes across as a fierce thriller with a history about the racism of slavery and how racism is still a problem in the world today.Due to the messy script, most of the cast do not deliver any special acting and they have all acted better in other films thanks to clearer scripts of these other films."
3,"""From the producers of Get Out"": this was what hooked me into watching this abomination. I was expecting another gripping, unique, and complex film like Get Out, but boy was I wrong. All I got was an unexplainably bad movie that would take more than words to explain how bad it is.As much as I didn't enjoy this film, I do have some positives to say. If I was to point out the best part of the film, I will tell you that the opening sequence (where all the credits show up) was the best. The cinematography was beautifully executed in the plantation sequences of the film, and this is especially true for the opening. The camera movement is similar to that of Alfonso Cuaron's Roma, where the camera doesn't focus on a particular person and moves fluidly and thusly capturing the whole scene. The opening sequence of the film was like actually walking into this Southern plantation as the camera shifted focus as it moved, just like how our attention changes to different things as we walk. Aside from the cinematography, I do think the first act of the film in the Southern plantation was actually well executed. The brutality and the desperation of slavery was well depicted in these first sequences, and I constantly felt the tension of the slavery experience. Unfortunately, this is where all the positives end, and a long list of negatives begin.The story structure of the film is really simple: there is a exposition and a conclusion. Nothing in-between. The majority of all the films ever created in the history of man follow the structure of introducing the characters, some sort of struggles in the middle, and a finale. The film Tenet was criticized for cutting the ""introduction"" segment of the plot, but at least it didn't cut the middle segment. The hero's journey that goes from the beginning of the film and the end of the film should be what fills up most of the runtime, and cutting that segment is the equivalent of removing the meat from your burger and just eating the bun. This is sadly what the film does. The movie has 2 non chronological introductions and a unsatisfying plot twist/finale and completely cuts out the middle. The movie begins by exploring the world of antebellum South, and sets up the world and the kind of world these slaves live in, and jumps back to the ""past"" where a overlong introduction of the characters begin. The movie then jumps back in the time line where the first act ended, and jams in a plot twist and a finale in the third act. So the film's structure, in summary, is just an expedition in the first 2 acts and a finale in the third act, and I cannot help but shout in the top of my lungs: WHY!!! Even a 3 year old can write something in the middle in between to fill up the gap between the begging and end of the story, but apparently the screenwriters of this film were so smart that they cut out a crucial portion of any story. This ""cutout"" of the middle results in not only a uncompelling story but also a bunch of flat characters. The main character of the movie, as she was not properly explored in the missing middle section, was nothing more than a feminist/SJW who happened to be kidnapped, and the villains of the film were just a bunch of white racist people wearing Confederate uniforms. This whole film can be told in a sentence: a black feminist/sjw is kidnapped by a bunch of Confederate wannabes and escapes. Boom! I just told you the whole story. The twist of the film, which revealed the truth, was not only extremely stupid but also poorly executed. The film makes a wide turn and tells us that all the brutally witnessed in the first act was nothing but a bunch of white wannabe confederates mistreating black people in a ""civil war enactment museum"", and everything actually happened in the present instead of the past. Not only does the film implode by undermining everything that happened, but it also executes the twist in a stupid way. No matter how stupid the truth is, most movies gradually reveal the truth. But this film just bluntly tells us that the whole show was just a cosplay party by the wannabe confederates instead of going through the process of descovering the truth. And as the truth is bluntly revealed, the film arrives to a blunt finale where the wannabes are easily killed off and the protagonist is rescued. It promptly ends with a lot of questions unanswered: why did these white people decide to dress up in confederate uniforms and capture black people? Why is the film in nonchronological order? What did they actually want to communicate? Do they want us to be aware of the fact that there still exists wannabe confederates? The answers to these questions still remain ambiguous, and I do not think I have the energy to analyze further.Overall, this is a movie that is extremely poorly written that it makes you wonder whether an actual adult wrote it. If you are desperately thirsty for horrendous movies, I strongly recommend it. But if you are expecting another Get Out, I will just tell you here that all you will find is a one-sentence plot and a bunch of flat characters."
4,"When I saw the trailer of this movie, I thought it was going to be a weird horror movie that is fun to watch. But when I watched the movie, it was so much different. There isn't any horror in it. Its not a bad movie but it's not what I expected. They're were literally people walking out of the cinema because they expected something different.Its a fine movie to watch.
But not cinema worthy.
There's no horror in it.
Its not a scary movie just violent in the way slavery."
5,Please please don't waste your time. You'll thank me later.
6,"Why didn't the writer and production team spend more time developing this story? This movie had the potential to be very interesting .One that would of been a must see, but it falls short. At first I was intrigued as well as excited,but as the movie shifted to the last part I started to get a sense of where it was heading. It just was not as clever as I had thought it would be. It is missing so much of the story and creative elements that you are left wanting. The ending twist is revealed so quickly, it makes the twist stupid. If it would of been presented in a different way it may have changed my impressions.
I will say it is visually appealing but that doesn't make up for the substance it lacks. I will tell you truly the last thoughts and feeling I had when the ending credits started was ""What it is over, where is the rest?"" Followed by a feeling of thorough disappointment.
So in short the movie starts of interesting and ends with you feeling disenchanted and let down."
7,"Systematic and institutionalised racism is a very relevant and serious problem around the world and thus I was very hopeful for this movie. However the trailer is misleading as it is not a horror/thriller; though there is heavy imagery of racism which on itself is a horror.
Let me start off by saying the the actors and actresses in the movie are amazing (Janelle always delivers) and the amazing soundtrack really brings (the only) thriller tone to the movie. However, it feels like they thought of a basic plot (which on itself is a interesting idea) and then completely butchered it. There are so many plot holes and illogical moves the characters make. To keep suspense as to what the reason is for the slave encampment they totally ignore all other characters and have them react totally illogical for modern day folk. I get the point is that they are afraid of the horrible white people, but I find it weird that Janelle's character is the only one who can save them. Wouldn't it be a better message if all the captured black people would stand up and free themselves? Instead they paint Janelle's character as a sort of beacon, while the rest of characters are portrayed as helpless and unimportant.
Next to that I find that Gabourey's character rather hypocritical for the message they are trying to get across. She says several objectifying thing to men and even touches a taxi driver without asking, which seems to make him uncomfortable. Her character says and does things which would have not been acceptable if done by a man.
The ending also tries to be smart but just ins't executed well at all, because another current problem is the extreme surveillance. HOW can two people in a car kidnap hundreds of people outside of busy and (most likely) surveillanced street. I am assuming they also transported people in the cars to the camp. Plus it is next to a tourist spot, burning bodies causes a thick smoke that is unmistakable! I'm sorry, I understand the message and the representation in the movie is important. But the plot is fucking awful... it feels like they did not think of anything."
8,"This is certainly a must see movie! I wouldn't necessarily classify it as horror, but more so as a thriller. I'm not sure why Rotten Tomatoes and many other movie review platforms gave this movie such a low rating, because it definitely wasn't deserved. I assume some folks aren't too keen of seeing portrayals of slavery or being reminded of how African Americans were treated back in the 1800s. To each his own, however, the ""slavery"" portrayal in this movie shouldn't take away from the overall brilliance and creativity of this film.This is a very well made movie with a captivating twist of an ending. Watch and see for yourselves!"
9,"I really enjoyed this movie, Forget the negative reviews, watch it yourself...."
10,"Antebellum may not be a horror movie like the trailer suggests, however: it is all about the horrors its main characters go through. Antebellum is an interesting ride throughout, with much contrast, a strong ambience and great acting."
11,If this movie would take 30 minutes It would be the same
12,"It's been a long while since I've looked at my phone halfway through a movie to see how much longer it has left, but that's how disappointing this was.Like many, I got sucked in by the ""by the producers of Get Out & Us"" - this is nowhere near the same quality. There is no humor, no suspense, and the acting is poor. I can't think of a single performer that impressed me - even Monae let me down this time.The first 1/2 hour was strong but then it completely degenerated. The twist was interesting and probably the only thing of note that I took away from the viewing. And as important as the 'message' of the film was, it couldn't have been any more hamfisted in its delivery. Such a waste."
13,"Performances were great. The cinematography as well. The beginning sequence grabs your attention and makes you want to watch the movie.There are little Easter Eggs throughout the movie and you want to watch a second time. In the meantime, you are a little off balance as to what's happening.Ignore the negative reviews. This movie is not boring. On the sending watch it goes at a quick pace.I loved Siddibe's performance. The restaurant scene had me lol!For people who think this can't happen. People are kidnapped everyday and held as sex slaves for decades. I remind you of the little girl who was kidnapped and lived in the backyard of her kidnapper for decades in plain sight. It's a movie, movies require some degree of suspension of disbelief. The same whiners about reality probably watch zombie movies and movies based on comics.BTW for people who didn't get it, there's a reason they look to the heroine for escape. Think about it. The girl said, I know you."
14,"This is my first review on IMDB.
I saw the movie yesterday and found it very good. The negative comments are in no justice to this film.
Sure it's not a horrormovie and the adds around this film are misleading.Antebellum is an original movie, has a great performance of the lead actress, an unpredictable script and an important message.
Don't expect to see a gripping horrorflick, but a gripping good film"
15,"Watched the film tonight and was very let down. The cinematography was perfect but failed to deliver with the story. Its a very ""now"" message highlighting the fact that racism is alive and strong. If you watch for the horror aspect you'll be extremely unimpressed. Its disheartening to see so many films with potential succumb to the woke culture. My 4 star rating was purely for cinematography and the score. I cant stress how perfect the opening 20 minutes are and how beautiful the final song aligns with the struggle the heroin faces. The acting was over the top and unbelievable. The story failed itself in too many ways to count, but the one way that mattered more than anything is that it hammers the same logic any woke film does. White is bad, black is power and the patriarchy is evil. If you don't mind hearing that message in every movie you watch, THIS is the film for you. For those of us that seek originality and good story telling, we'll probably give nothing more than 5 stars."
16,"A website had this listed as ""sci-fi thriller"", another as ""psychological horror thriller"". There is NO sci-fi. There is no thriller. There is no physhological anything. There is no horror. A political agenda film (the only thing this is), was misleadingly categorized and titled in a dozen of ways, none of which apply. JUNK!!!"
17,"I honestly dont understand why this has such a low rating except maybe for the fact that some white people upset that white people being portrayed as the villains. Or is it because its another slave movie? I've also seen some people complain that its not really a horror like its advertised, and ok...it does feel ,more like a thriller than a true horror but that doesnt make it less captivating. I was really invested in Eden/Veronica and the mystery of how she's seemingly in the 1800s deep south. The twist isnt super complicated, I was able to make a guess that turned out right. But again, this didnt detract from my enjoyment of the film. I thought it had a very interesting storyline. I wont say the film the is perfect. Jena Malone (especially during the last act) does a bit of scenery chewing as the villain. I also thought the end in general with Eden/Veronica riding on horseback in slow-mo felt a little hokey. It was maybe a little confusing why Eden/Veronica was made out to be the ""saviour"". I get she is the main character but it didnt make sense why out of everyone Julia specifically went to her for help. And I didnt see much chemistry between Eden?Veronica and her friend Dawn. But really other than that, I wasn't disappointed with the film and found it fascinating.Janelle Monae is incredible in the film. It probably won't happen but she would be completely deserving of an Oscar nom. Also, I absolutely loved the score. Especially in that intro scene, it really sucks you into this story and feels perfectly unsettling. I loved all the visual nods and references to other parts in the film.The film is definitely intense. And while yes, it is another slave movie to a degree, I felt like this at least tried to do something different with that genre.But overall, I liked it, and feel like is a worth a watch."
18,"I was expecting a horror movie and it started out somewhat as a horror movie, and while the movie was going nowhere it had a dark theme to it, then halfway through 'click' instantly a different movie, like you changed the channel on tv, felt like I was watching the news or some reality show WTF complete bait and switch, anyways fast forwarded boooring no horror themes yet....then finally pulled the plug. I guess they were trying to put across some pc message or something but definitely mislead and not a horror movie.Skip this one, you will be glad you did."
19,"As polarising a film as you'll see all year, that Janelle Monáe felt strongly enough to take the lead and that the film needed to be made in the first instance, says so much about the inequalities, prejudice and hatred that continues to exist in societies: but you knew that because you see it in the news and on social media every day and quite probably have become immune to its impact - which is why it continues to perpetuate through generations and is as tough to eradicate as the common cold.An extremely imaginative and original way to emphasise a message and make a point. If you take delight in critiquing and criticising the more technical shortcomings of the film I'm afraid you've completely missed that point, perhaps you're a little too immune - rewind and try again."
20,I watched this with my friends in a cinema and we lughted the whole time. Movie has no tension. It tries to be a thriller but it fails. The conversation and the plot are so cringy. It tries to send some kind of empowerment message but its so corny. Would reccomend for some laughts with friends but if you wanna be entatained by movie dont watch it.
21,Very bad movie waste of money how stupid is the ending
22,"Firstly, I see people on some of these reviews talking about originality. This movie isn't that original. Have you people never heard of ""The Village""? Now, that movie didn't involve slavery or kidnapping but the rest is about the same. Another problem I have is, this was not a horror or mystery as it was advertised unless you're talking about the horrors of slavery. I will give it the other moniker of being a thriller. The acting was alright, but I wouldn't go any higher than that. I saw where someone else mentioned an Oscar nod. Not sure what that person was smoking.As for the overall, it was alright but I wouldn't give this film anything other than maybe a crime drama thriller. And then the big taboo. The people who wrote and produced this really should seek professional help as they seem to really have a problem with white people. It was a political movie, all throughout. They may not want to say it is, but it is and people let me say, white people are not the boogieman you make them out to be. White people are not gods sitting somewhere controlling everybody's lives. If you have problems or aren't successful in life, you may want to look in the mirror. I'm not saying racism and prejudice doesn't exist, I'm just saying you can't blame all problems everywhere on it."
23,"Believe the low reviews. Because the bot accounts are saying the opposite.This movie is straight up trash. Nothing good has been produced/released in 2020 from Hollywood.Good acting, horrible execution, confusing ending. Just not good, plain and simple."
24,"I was looking for a good thriller/horror movie and was very disappointed. This movie was somewhat good, but definitely not a horror film, and it didn't come together well."
25,I read some of the reviews and I'm pretty sure I know why some folks rated it so low 😒
26,"I waited a long time for this to be released as I love horror. This wasn't horror. I understand the point the movie is making and credit to them for trying to tell it in a different way but there is no twist here. Fifteen minutes in I guessed the scenario she was in and at the end of the film you're just left thinking 'that's ridiculous it could never happen' which then downplays the whole narrative a bit. 'The Village' by Shyamalan is way better and more believable in actual fact. I think once more people have seen this film I can see it landing a rating of 3.5 and an entrant onto the worst movies of 2020 list, which is a shame because there are some ok performances but the plot is dissatisfying and ludicrous really. Such a shame."
27,"Usually I try and look for the good in a movie but in this case there's nothing, and I honestly mean nothing, positive I can say about it. It's so utterly ridiculous it defies the mind. The storyline is complete nonsense. It takes about an hour or so to even remotely have anything happen in this film. If you want to spend an hour and a half of looking at nothing then be my guest and watch it. But you have been warned. I cannot believe how bad this movie.....really bad."
28,"It feels like I have been waiting for 'Antebellum' to come out for an eternity. Ever since I first heard about it I have been aching to see it. It just looked like such a well put together film and such a mysterious and interesting plot. Finally tonight I got to see it and I can confirm all of those things were true and much more as well. This film was gripping from start to finish.I absolutely love the structure this film was told with. It threw me and had me a little baffled for a while there, but in the end it all made sense and was easy to go back and see things from a different light where the film had deceived me (in a good way). Twists in films are becoming rarer and rarer, but I still love a good one when it comes around and this was a banger.The film is broken up into three very distinct thirds, and I loved every one of them in its own way. Each of them them has a lot to offer, and the film wouldn't be what it was without each of them adding their piece. The final one though will blow you away. This is such a unique film. It's really hard to think of anything that would be a decent comparison for it. Originality in this day and age is such a rare and under-appreciated thing.Finally, this movie was tense. The final twenty minutes in particular. I cared so much about the characters and their fate that I was on the edge of my seat throughout. I would suggest the less you know about this film going in, the more you are going to enjoy it. This is a wonderful film and an absolute must-see."
29,"Antebellum tells the remarkable story of Eden, a slave on a plantation somewhere in America. It also chronicles events in the life of a successful modern-day author called Veronica. As the film progresses, the connection between these two storylines becomes clear, and that's about all I can say about the plot.THE POSITIVESOne of the biggest strengths of the flick, is a masterful hand behind the camera. Gorgeous cinematography, guided by thoughtful direction, bring as much emotional impact to the film as the stellar performances do. The structural editing on display here, is a showcase of the profound understanding the filmmakers have of the narrative. The film is filled to the brim with subtle visual setups that have satisfying pay-offs at the end. The opening scene is one of the most gripping collection of images, I've seen all year. It was an absolute treat to discover that the final sequence reaches the same impactfull heights but with a very different connotation. I can't stress enough how the technical aspects of Antebellum are Oscarworthy. cinematography, lighting, production design and costume design are in a league of their own. They all work together to truly make the performances shine.
THE NEGATIVESUnfortunately, the film undoes a lot of the greatness within itself, as the flick goes along. The underlying message is anything but underlying. It rather weighs down heavily on the audience and is often times spelled out to the letter. All of the striking, brutal imagery, is somehow negated by heavy-handed pandering to an agenda, I don't even disagree with. An almost comedic over the top female villain who is in sharp contrast with some bold, grounded performances by other antagonists, offers nothing more than frustration. I truly want to love this film more than it allows me to.THE VERDICTAntebellum is composed out of a collection of striking images that showcase craftsmanship in front and behind the camera. Its brutal, grounded and thoughtful imagery is undermined however, by a painfully, spelled out message that comes across as pandering more often than not."
30,"Not sure why this film was even made in the first place. Was it to push a message relevant to the times? If it was, then it failed miserably as it was lost in a poor plot and flat characters. It just didn't make sense and I feel like they over promoted this film with social media ads just to disappoint. Is it worth $20, I'd say no."
31,"Granted, the trailer DID MISLEAD. But, that doesn't meant this movie was bad. In fact, quite opposite. Very suspenseful and well executed! The trailer makes you think it'll go one way but takes you a completely different path which I loved! For anyone who disliked it, shame on you"
32,When I go to see a movie I go to be entertained - not preached to.
33,"I fell asleep three times during this movie. Nothing is happening, storyline is not there. Its just not good, acting is so weak, rather hilarious in few moments. I don't think they brought what they wanted, idea was cool, execution was terrible. Its just one of million ridiculous fails of horror movie."
34,"Honestly, this movie lacks originality. Its predictable & lackluster, the end."
35,"Downloaded with some expectations (Despite this guy Jordan Peel as Director/Writer/Producer is soooooooo OVERRATED) I watched 28 mins and I deleted from my hard drive. Isn't Horror genre, IMDB must check this genre classification ASAP. Don't waste your time. Read a book instead."
36,"Ok. So there are a lot of people taking issue with this due to the current politial environment in the US, some are taking issue with it because they feel it is a ""The Village"" remake and some are taking issue with it because they see it more as a thriller than horror. I guess you will decide how you like it based on your position concerning these issues.In terms of our political environment, things are not good. I am a Southerner. I've heard the arguments for both the destruction of heritage and the continued insult of the treatment of African Americans. It is a sensitive topic for which, I have no ideas on how to appease everyone. So, in choosing to watch this, I decided to lay personal opinions to the side so that I could watch what was being presented without prejudice.As for this being a ""The Village"" remake. Yeah, I'm not on board with this at all. In ""The Village,"" the circumstances of the village founders are far different. They raise children who are unaware of the world beyond the boundaries of the village of their birth. They are naive and brainwashed. This film is different and not really comparable in my opinion.As to whether it is horror or not, well if this happened to me, I would be horrified. Kidnappings, torture, murder and the dehumanization of others is monstrous. To imply that these are merely ""suspensful"" or ""thrilling"" topics alone shows a removal from the realization that, while watching it in a film, it is meant to portray something happening in real time to real people and will steal from the horror of it. Although it lacks the blood, guts and gore of hardcore horror, this is a psychological horror film if you are open minded enough to experience it. It is chilling.I review films as I see them and while I'm sure that with such a divisive film I'm gonna get a lot of hate for this, it will have no bearing on my opinion. I say if you are interested in seeing this, don't let the negative reviews deter you. Watch it and come to your own conclusion. It is a well made film and I thought the acting was good. Subject matter is sensitive, political and divisive but overall I thought the story was rather unique.Check it out and make up your own mind as to whether you like it."
37,"I thought this might be an interesting story to watch, but was soon disappointed by the continual political and stereotypical portraits, which results in a predictable and very poorly put together film.The visuals are quite good, which is why I rated this three.One to miss, or wait until it comes on a free service."
38,"Disregard all the negative reviews and comments. The right individuals will understand this movie and its context. This movie skillfully and rightfully depicts America today - masking the horrors of our past in the name of ""patriotism"" and heritage.Keep your eyes and ears open while watching this! EVERYTHING is shown for a purpose and reason - details! Details like the house slaves uniform is the exact uniform worn by the hotel's housekeeping staff. Touches like that you'll miss if you're only looking at this for face value. This movie has sooo much! Love it!"
39,This movie was literally very interesting and different from the thrillers we are used to.
40,"This isn't even a horror film. And the trailer is misleading. It wants you to think it some kind of time travel thing but Spoiler alert: It is not a time travel movie. She is kidnapped for her political and racial movement views and forced to work as a slave on a remote plantation in a civil war reenactment park. But it isn't fun and games, it's like a real civil war plantation, they frequently abuse and kill the slaves, so yeah it's not a reenactment."
41,Truly horrible concept. I can't believe I wasted 1 hrs and a half of my life. This movie sums up 2020.
42,"Several things were wrong with the script and a serious rewrite should have occurred. The theme, reminds me of a novel written years ago, only the racial roles were reversed and descendants of slaves operated the camp. The visuals were pretty decent, but standard. I believe they intended the imagery during the end as a metaphor, but honestly it felt cheap. It seems the social commentary is the only thing hot coming out of film these days, which this one just missed the malt."
43,"Wtf is this listed as a horror? Absolutely no horror. This is one of the most stupidest story lines ever. Why would the black people even participate in this? I know the bad guys have guns, but I would fight them until they or I die. Especially when they kill your wife or whoever. You know you've been kidnapped but you can easily fight and grab their guns. And the black people had many chances to kill their captives. They fall asleep and u can easily kill them or at least knock them out and escape. And that guy just leaves his phone on his horse? And how long does this reenactment take place? And what do they do with the black people once the reenactment finishes? And anyone can go do the reenactment, but they r all bad people? I mean killers and rapists and so on? No decent people ever join and see how the black people r really treated? And the ending was the best. NOT! She rode the horse for what, 5 minutes and escaped? The visuals and acting was fine, but the movie was total crap and made no sense."
44,Please don't waste your time. This turned out to be such a disappointment and I felt that good talent was so wasted.
45,"This notion that a bunch of people have to be slaughtered to be a horror movie is nonsense. This is a horror movie and really good one at that. Original, the acting was on point the it was beautifully filmed. And best of all it plays with your emotion, which is what movies are meant to do in the first place. Go see this movie!"
46,Without a doubt the WORST movie I've ever seen. I have no idea what I just watched
47,"Been to this movie just a few days ago, and compared to the movies 'us' and 'get out'. I will make two different points of the, in the title mentioned, subjects. First out the genre.The genre is completely incorrect.
Horror is nowhere to be found in this movie and it does not deserve that genre by any means. It's about as far of as giving 'conjuring' a comedie genre. It is just completely incorrect and if you want to watch a horror movie just go to any other one, even a bad one, is more horrific than this movie. Even the thriller genre annoys me a bit, because the biggest part of this movie you are just sitting and watching like... ''what exactly is the meaning of all of this?''Presentation
It has a more documentary vibe at first, and while doing that it is wrong on most parts, this is being fixed at the end of the movie. End meaning: really the end. Except this it is just a movie that bothers everyone with a bit of historical knowledge, this being fixed by the end for most parts, but still it really creates a feel that is historically incorrect.Conclusion
I can tell you i got the clue of this movie. In the end most of the people will be guessing what exactly is the point of this movie, as in, what was the actual story line etc. I did get the point, ofcourse i cant spoiler it so i won't, but i do get the point. I can't get out of my mind that this is a movie completely made to add to the racism debate. But doing it this way is just wrong, in my opinion. You can't release a movie presenting a historical view, that is incorrect, into the debate like this. Most people will not see the mistakes, because of the lack of historic knowledge about slavery. If the movie would've given the correct presentation on this point, i would give it a higher rating, but because it is full of biases about slavery, if it kept that out. It would at least be a correct presentation deserving a higher rate, but it has not."
48,"This is an awesome movie! It makes you really wonder with all the racism in America, if this is really secretly going on somewhere. I loved the attention to detail and the actors and actresses in this film. Janelle Monae played the heck out of her character. I really felt what she was going through. The story was well written. It was extremely realistic. Don't pay attention to the negative reviews. I honestly think they are by racist individuals who angry about what the film is about. Watch it for yourself. I was glued to it from beginning to end."
49,"From the movie description to the trailer,misleading. Not a gripping horror story, barely a story at all with how it's told. Weak and washy the entire way thru. A good social point trying to be made, just done so in an incoherent way. You will be able to follow the story, just won't want to!"
50,"40 min. into the movie and there's still no plot. Just a bunch of black woman beaten and abused by confederate soldiers without any plot to hook you up. I turned it off and gone watering the plants that was more exciting.This ""movie"" looks like special interest video for snuff lovers...I want my 40 min. back!"
51,This film made zero sense! No character development!
52,"Peele often speaks about the importance of community in his films. The experience of watching movies together and sharing in the reactions of a crowd. I think this is the only thing that kept me from ranking this movie lower. If I had watched this movie by myself I would not have enjoyed it nearly as much. The saving graces were the jokes cracked in my living room and the audible reactions and questioning of the main character's motives/ strategy.
I agree with many of the previous posts commenting on the film being tagged as horror and sci-fi. I didn't find any of those elements throughout the film - excluding the few Easter eggs I assumed were paying homage to the shinning. I would not classify this as a good movie and at the same time it is not a bad movie. During the first 20 min or so I felt like I was trying to figure out what the hell was happening, while the last 20 min had an enjoyable level of suspense."
53,"Just read the title all over....
Here you go the review, u already know it!"
54,"But I can't. The performances were great, but the story was... What was this story? Was this movie about slavery, or an underground kidnapping ring? Why was a cellphone the only way out? If this was a civil war reenactment camp, then are the soldiers actually killing each other for the spectators? If not, then why did they need real slaves? Was it for the free labor? Was a town cover up the reason why nobody seemed to know that this camp had spectators? Didn't those spectators have cell phones?
So many questions after watching this. Too many, really. This movie gave me a headache. This movie seems to get lost in a deep metaphor. That metaphor swallowed the logic in this movie. Wish I could give it more stars, but sadly, I cannot."
55,"This movie had all the potential in the world. It hooked me the first trailer I saw. It started strong and very interesting but as the movie went on it became very boring. I'm really disappointed by this movie. It felt like the movie just ends, It just turned out flat I would not recommend this movie."
56,"First of all, this is not a horror flick as the producers would have you believe. The story could have been developed to be more intriguing and suspenseful, instead we got a good concept with a bland delivery which overall wasn't a pleasure to view."
57,"Anything I could say about Antebellum, its title most surely a clue on what's next in Trump's America, would be overruled (in the target audience's brains) by the insuperable sexiness of Janelle Monáe and the inspiration she gives those who share her superficial characteristics (which, at the rate education is going, they may think is the same as sharing the history of the figure she portrays - the film is unintentionally on-point in how it places this present-day heroine in a Civil War era setting by force). Whether or not these viewers deserve better is irrelevant; they don't want better.Antebellum wants in on what Jordan Peele is doing; translating contemporary racial tensions (inspired, inevitably, by past sins) into extranormal horror scenarios. However, these filmmakers are not as gifted as Peele, neither in terms of crafting an atmosphere through the technical aspects, nor in terms of delivering themes effectively - even as Peele himself can get wonky on that last one.I don't think only persons of color will like this movie, of course; no doubt a few ""allied"" journalism graduates will get in on the praise, and me personally, I had fun with some of the mind-bending spoop moments and quite enjoy Monáe as a performer. I even liked her over-the-top Oscars number earlier this year.But the movie does kinda play into skin-deep identity politics. I saw someone comment on the fact that The National Review, a jilariously conservative outlet, had very predictably panned the film, stating the people at National Review must surely be ""afraid of us"". I'm wondering if they used the pronoun ""us"" to mean either queer black women or African-Americans, the latter of which is extra funny since the chief of film critique at National Review is, of course, Armond White - a black homosexual man. You see how it's not always as simple as Instagram activists make it sound? You see how other black viewers might feel pandered to, if not outright exploited?As biased as White may be, and as much as the above-mentioned stans will go ""YASSS"" at Monáe vanquishing her oppressors (played by the likes of Jena Malone, Jack Huston, and Eric Lange as ""Him""), many other critics are wondering what the film's larger point is, seeing past the ultimately shallow empowerment and spooky gore. Has it maybe, I dunno, shot itself in the foot?It likely wants to say something about racism today and how some people in power would no doubt like to see America go back to slavery - especially given how protective they are of monuments that resemble slavers, not to mention police brutality. However, I maintain that you could ""accidentally"" read the movie as a metaphor for reductive historical analysis, forcing a successful modern woman to walk in the shoes of a slave lady because... well, you know.Angry YouTube Men are going to have some fun with this one, methinks, even if they're among the people that Antebellum thinks it's ""stickin' it to""; maybe they think this proves that toppling over statues of literal slave-owners is contributing to historical illiteracy (I definitely agree that people have gotten sloppy at homework but I think we can do without the carved tributes to slavers). Expect a roast from Geeks+Gamers (a YouTuber whose moniker I'm sure is meant to also describe the contemporary authorities on racial politics) very soon.I guess the following rings true no matter what: people will see this picture and money will be made.As a horror romp, which is what I ought to be judging it as when I use it for my annual horror-thon, Antebellum is serviceable in its presentation, SFX, and tone. But when a film wants to seem like it's saying something (because we're in a year where it's extra lucrative to do so), and it either fails to say that thing or come off like it's instead saying something counterintuitive, that's what I'll get hung up on. Also, I am very sorry for citing Armond White."
58,"Even as desperate as I am to see any new entertainment, almost could not get through this movie."
59,The trailer for this movie looked amazing. Really interesting idea but the script is horrible. It looked like it would be across between Get Out and The village however the result was absent of the great storytelling skills of M. Night Shayamalan and Jordan Peele. We kept waiting for it to get better but unfortunately it just never turned around. What a great opportunity to make a unique movie with important cultural commentary that was completely wasted. We will never get that time back.
60,"I wish I could have gotten my time back, nothing special here."
61,"Omg this film is just bad. Why make a film that is horrific for the sake of it?! The message is...surprise, surprise: that racism exist in modern day societies. This is something that the most extremist of the BLM movement might push out to strike the flames of today's injustice. It is a type of film Spike Lee might have made. I don't know who would enjoy watching this type of film?"
62,"OK, I thought this was supposed to be based on Octavia Butler's novel Kindred and that's how it was marketed, but that's not what it was. It was basically the most implausible mass kidnapping movie ever made. And even as that, it failed. First, it was internally inconsistent. The main character is branded in ""the past"" and then wakes up in her own bed in ""the present"" and the brand's gone. Makes sense if it was a dream or she actually was time traveling, but makes no sense if she was just kidnapped. And if she was kidnapped, why would she think it was a dream? Why wouldn't she remember being serially raped? And why on earth would so many modern day people just accept being enslaved when they were being held only a few miles from civilization? The whole premise doesn't work. I like Janelle Monae, but this movie is just plain awful."
63,"This idea was not bad whatsoever, and I would have loved if it didn't take more than half of the movie to build up to the climax and then ended with little to no explanation for what was going on. I wish I was exaggerating by saying that the exposition took up half or more than half of the entire movie. The build up must have been twenty minutes at most, with maybe half an hour to forty minutes actually focused on the interesting part of the plot.The ending explains what happened pretty well, if you didn't understand it but they didn't really expand on what had actually happened.In some ways, I'd say that it is worth it to watch because the plot itself isn't the issue. However, it's a poor execution. There is almost no way that you won't feel disappointed."
64,"Don't even bother watching this. It is just flat out a bad movie. There is no horror, there is no plot. There is nothing about it that is interesting. The only part that gets interesting is the last 15 minutes. Other than that, it is just a incredibly terrible movie."
65,"Horrrrrible...nothing like get out or anything at all....sooo boring and stupid, i never write reviews but this was sooo disappointing. Nothing at all happened for first 40mins...nothing, then still dumb and stupid cant belive this bs movie"
66,I thought the movie was insightful and brought the aspect of the African American life. I am happy the Janelle Monae was the lead her acting was amazing. At the end I was so caught up in the suspense I was pacing the floor.
67,"Absolutely NOT a horror movie or thriller. Sad attempt to keep people living in the past and thinking that white people just want to keep black people slaves. We will never move forward until people leave the past in the past.After reading most of the ""great movie"" reviews, it's apparent that people like myself who did not believe this to be a good movie is ""siding with hate"" and basically racist. Absolutely ridiculous. 99% of white people would agree that racism is/was wrong. There will always be some who still think the way they did back then but they are a lot fewer than Hollywood and the news would have you believe.Bottom line, this movie fuels racism and gets people riled up all over again about things that happened back then."
68,"The movie is solid, original, with an entertaining and unexpected twist. The negative reviews are clearly political. The plot and ultimate storyline match the incredible cinematography, and any effort to diminish this movie's integrity is only born out of a dislike for the subject matter. Not the movie itself. It deals with slavery and racism, sure. But the story it's telling, at its core, is a great one. Shame on those who hate on this film as part of their crusade against progressive thinking. But kudos to the studio that produced it.The movie holds up from beginning to end, but unfortunately won't get its due respect, as it is now simply a casualty of the division this country is experiencing, and a disdain for anything that challenges the status quo in America. Great job from the acting to the directing. It's very entertaining."
69,"Amazing, beautiful cinematography and engaging story line. Down votes are haters. See and enjoy"
70,I fell asleep after the first act. Just after it cut to modern day. Caught a bit of the ending. And it didn't inspire me to want to see what I missed.
71,"Please please please, if you haven't watched, don't.
I watched the preview and was honestly excited. I thought it was going to be another decent Jordan peele film that was thrilling and scary.
What I watched was a failed abortion of filmography.
I was with family and that was the only reason I finished. After finishing we all were very confused and agreed it was stupid.
Not only does it not make any sense but it's just a massive politically charged movie."
72,"This movie had potential, it started really well, it could have told a good story, provided a meaningful lesson, but in reality it brought nothing more but hatred, stereotyping and division. At some point the plot became silly, unrealistic, too biased and overall it was disappointment. This movie is focused too much on race and gender and some obsolete stereotypes. Instead of presenting us with interesting and complex characters, good story and development the movie just tries to compensate the black people somewhat by providing them some sort of revenge. While the only thing that it achieves is not a lesson, but more division. 100% of the white male characters were bad, 95% of the white women chracters were bad. The timelines were messed up and not in place. The stereotyping is just ridiculous. I understand that this movie is from black people for black people, but c'mon guys, you can do better."
73,"Totally Boring movie.
Really don't see how it can be classified as a horror film
It's just another black slavery film and made no impression whatsoever on me
total waste of time"
74,Its Get Out meets The Village. Ignore the hate and watch it. Thank me later.
75,"From the very opening scene this film grabs your attention. The cinematography and the soundtrack of the opening scene is absolutely brilliant, outstanding and emotional. The first thought that will come into your head is, ""Wait, is this a horror film or a historical civil war drama?"" That's what I found was so amazing about this film in that it completely misleads the viewer in the beginning. But if you ever loved the Twilight Zone anthology series with Ron Serling, you will be in for a treat because this film isn't at all what it seems.I won't give the twist away because this film can easily be ruined if the twist is unveiled before watching the film. All I will say is the director and technical crew really know how to pull the emotional nerves, at least during the plantation scenes. The modern day portion of the film I personally didn't care for but after watching until the end I understood why they added it in there. It's just the plantation scenes made this film feel like a much higher budget film than it really was. As an old Twilight Zone fan I can really appreciate this film."
76,"I like Janelle Monáe, but she is utterly wasted in this absurd film with an even more absurd twist. The woke message is an obvious one, spread too thickly, and one that comes across as preaching to the choir. The violence is exploitative and feels gratuitous. I didn't like this film at all. It had nothing to say... and it said it loudly."
77,Absolutely terrible movie. The intro and first 30 mins were interesting. Wanted to turn it off when I found out the first 30 mins of the movie wasn't even reality. Don't recommend. Not exaggerating when I say this movie is trash and a waste. Had a lot of potential but the producers tried to add way too much mystery than wasn't needed. Don't bother watching.
78,This movie was just not good at all. It left a lot of things unexplained.. the concept and execution of the film was terrible. It just didn't make a whole lot of sense. I get what they were trying to convey in this movie but it was not done well at all and missed a lot of important points. I can't believe I'm wasting my time writing a review about this movie but I'm just soo disappointed after waiting to see this movie for so long it actually pisses me off how damn bad it was.
79,"I watched the trailer and thought it looked interesting. However, you quickly realize this is going nowhere, and going at a snail's pace! The author was far more interested in perpetuating their beliefs, then producing a well laid out story. It has moments of interest, but they are far apart and disjointed at best. Just awful...truly."
80,"As a female poc, this movie realized all my nightmares and made them all too realistic. Brilliant film and highly recommend."
81,There's not much thrill to be had from this movie. Takes way too long to get going and just doesn't deliver on the horror part at all. Scary premise for black people but it doesn't pick up till the end.
82,"I like the concept of this movie. I know that some people would say this is not a horror. I don't want to spoil the film so I'm not going to say much. However being a black woman myself, I would say hell yeah this is a horror to me. Definitely worth watching, be open minded."
83,"Great movie, not your typical horror movie, but it touches on the realness of the horror of racism. This movie has you guessing but once you realize what's happening, the sad thought of, ""This could actually happen,"" pops up. Ignore the poor reviews - I can only assume those leaving negative reviews side with hate."
84,"I was blown away by this movie. First there's the message, it's heavy and cynical, it's #blacklivesmatter smacking you right in the face and belly. As a North-European white man I hardly dare to pretend to know anything of what black people in America have to cope with, I guess (and sure hope!) that this movie has enlarged it for the sake of the argument. But it chilled me to the bone watching all the goings-on in the first half hour, even thinking (unjustified, as it turned out) that this was all in the past. If just a fraction of the frame of mind that could make such a violent and degrading attitude towards black people is a reality today, then there are still mountains of prejudice and hate to be demolished.But there's more to this movie. I really think it's cinematographically brilliant. The various shifts in perspective that came (to me at least) as total surprises and every time hit me like a rock, up to the last one in more or less the last scenes. The haunting musical score, bleak and unnerving and more and more building up the tension. The stunning opening sequence of some 10 minutes, in one seamless take that gradually brings you from an almost idyllic atmosphere into unbridled violence. The numerous seemingly casual but oh so intelligent details, like the flirting guy coming over to the table of the girlfriends and the camera never raising its point of view above his waist. The scenes in the hotel, heavy with foreboding and almost unbearable tension, reminding me of Brian de Palma movies.And then there's in my opinion yet another side to this movie, a second message. Gabourey Sidibe's character Dawn reacts extremely condescending to the guy that comes to pay her a compliment, and in the taxi her actions to the driver feel awkward and definitely crossing the #metoo borders. And heroine Veronica/Eden (Janelle Monáe) reacts to her tormenters with almost the same relentless violence as she had to endure. The movie obviously wants to show that there is not a hard unsurpassable line between good and bad and everyone can be driven to objectionable behavior, either by being pushed to the limits, by stupidity or by sheer lack of insight. So a movie like this (or movements like #blacklivesmatter) seem like a good thing if they can lead to more insight, empathy and mutual respect between people. These words sound so easy but apparently living them is the hardest thing ever."
85,"A few scenes, are different than reality (in movie)
Movie is boring
In 1:01:00 you will know she is kidnapped
End is terrible
In this movie isn't too good as I expected from trailer
In first scene, the music does not fit the picture
This isn't horror, this is thirller"
86,"And this will be the most detailed review I've ever left:In 2020, this movie couldn't be more relevant or important. You won't understand until the end but along the way you'll get it. Just watch it from start to finish. It's not horror. It's very close to reality, and that's even scarier."
87,I am a HUGE Jordan Peele fan I love horror/thriller movies and I loved Get Out and US. So I could not wait to watch Jordan's new release Antebellum. ummmm It sucked I mean there is no other way to review it. It SUCKED. It was NOT a horror/thriller movie. It was basically ROOTS for 2020. And this is not the time to be releasing a movie like this. So don't waste your money or your time.
88,"For those who don't think this is a horror movie, must believe that this could never happen to them. Great movie!!! When I saw the contrails in the sky in the beginning I thought someone made a mistake but........"
89,Just trash. Don't waste your time or money on this trash.
90,"Frustratingly ridiculous movie that could have totally lived up to its profound opening Faulkner quote about the past still being alive, particularly regarding slavery's legacy in today's structural racism.Instead, this is a poorly written mess, with an absurd twist that essentially trivializes the horrors of slavery, while completely drawing attention away from how racism operates in today's society via political institutions, economic injustice, and everyday culture. Mining the cultural arena is what made ""Get Out"" so great.Anyway, this is a waste of talent and, sadly, opportunity to say something profound about ongoing problems today. It clearly tries to contribute to the broader conversation started by Black Lives Matter, but lacks it analytical depth and narrative sophistication."
91,"Antebellum will get lots of praise or get slammed - simple because of the ""political"" implications the story got regarding racism, but for my taste Antebellum is for a connoisseur of true horror a rather boring affair. I like for example 12 Years a Slave a lot, but the horror genre is in my view not the right place for that kind of ""serious"" story or message - too many times I cheer for the bad guys in such movies (like in Get Out I voted for the crazies and not for our meant to be hero). Anyway, as it is sold as a horror movie, my rate is indeed just a three and no more - the producers and writers should have simply opted to make a historical drama. My opinion."
92,"Decent storyline, poorly executed. Oddly placed fillers throughout. Overall, I would have rather donated my $20 than spend it on this movie."
93,"Jordan, Jordan, Jordan. . .just NO bruh! Actually, the best part of the movie was the GREAT advice Gabourey Sidibe gave at the dinner table.
That's it.
As much as I enjoy Janelle Monae and Jordan Peele, not worth the $20 VOD fee."
94,I'm not picky when it comes to movies but this was just boring n came off as amateur. Super disappointed
95,First off I hate being mislead by the trailer. Nothing scary or or thrilling about this film; has that same sad old non-original story about social justice. However I feel there could have been something here if it was written and directed better.
96,"I'm perplexed that some reviewers on here have labelled the movie ""political"". As far as I'm aware there remains no political parties that deny the abhorrence of slavery nor racial oppression. This movie does not villanize white people, it villanizes villains. Moreover, the motives of the villains are undeclared and ambiguous - although there are hints at racial motivations but these are left for the viewers interpretation. To classify the movie as political suggests the producers had a political statement to make or political motivation. One can only presume that is to say they are suggesting racism still exists. This of course is not up for debate, its fact, it DOES. This is not political. There is a reason as to why the 'slave owners' are white and the 'slaves' are black. *The answer is left as an exercise for the reader.*
As a white man I am no more ashamed of the white villains in this movie as I am to white bond villains. I am not them.One reviewer asked a question about the movie and questioned its continuity in doing so, so I thought I'd explain:The reason Veronica doesn't have branding in the shower scene is simply because she hasn't been branded yet. After she wakes from the initial slavery scenes she hasn't dreamed that at all, it's a con, and it works. There are two time lines and they jump between them but the slavery scenes all succeed the ""normal"" scenes.They also ask about why do they burn the cotton. Well why not burn the cotton? What else are they to do with it? They aren't really running a plantation to profit from cotton, it's not for sale."
97,"Antebellum is an ugly, dumb movie, made by and for idiots. A few scenes and some of the ideas work, and it does look very pretty, but that's about it.The ""twist"" is not one. The whole thing is so obvious, a derivative mess that's been lazily written, poorly edited, and acted awkwardly.Gabourey Sidibe is a big bright spot as the comic relief, her character and performance in an entirely separate film from everyone else.Most of the symbolism and dialogue is so on-the-nose, so term papery, it's just so, so clunky. I really wanted to like this, but damn...Also, perhaps the real killer for a supposed horror film - it's not at all frightening, but then it's also never once believable.Really bad stuff.Grade: D+"
98,"Thought we were getting another slave movie, but that pllt twist! Awesome! Totally worth the watch, couldn't stop watching. Just with gabby could have toned down some. But still great."
99,"Well idea was so good, but production was so bad... Movie is holding attention like waves hiting a rock on the beach..."
100,Horrible acting and accents. The back and forth was not done very well and was to long.
101,Absolutely terrible. One twist that could have gone somewhere but far too late and went nowhere. Save your hard earned money!!!
102,"Dont watch it, it's very boring. I watched on OTT in the beginning I thought it to be promising since I am horror fan. More than half an hour in the movie I was not able to take it further I found it slow boring."
103,If you think that 2020 is bad watch this movie. Bad beginning and more bad ending.
104,"A truly ""Hot Garbage"". After this movie, I thought they tried to do a spin on ""The Village"" but it was a major fail. This could have been written much better. The transition did not work it was sloppy. Honestly I had no idea what I was watching. when they move to modern times it blew my mind, no proper transition sequence or anything.. When the movie was over I asked myself "" What the hell had i just wasted my time on? Of course this is only my opinion and not trying to rain on anyone's parade. I hated it! The twist was terrible but I think that the movie would've worked better if the characters were more fleshed out and it's terrible. I was expecting a horror/mystery flick but instead I got a modern day Roots flick. There really wasn't a suspenseful moment in the entire movie and I actually got bored at several points."
105,"Not sure who asked for a remake of The Village with a slave plantation instead of a village, but alas, here we are."
106,"A strong establishing scene full of promise - promises it fails to keep. Stilted dialogue, forced acting, and a big, bluff twist makes it a unsatisfying experience all-in-all."
107,"I'm not sure what others were expecting but I enjoyed this film. I thought it was a fairly unique take on familiar themes about racism, ""past"" and present. The twist wasn't expected but made sense to me, especially within the context. Janelle Monae did her thing and shows great promise as an actress, in my opinion (as a professor of Theatre & Cinema). It's definitely worth a watch."
108,"Watch it just in case you have no other choice or a masochist. My wife gave up at around 15 minutes. I gave up shortly after middle. Boring, stupid and makes absolutely no sense.
Gave it a 1 because there is no zero option."
109,This movie doesn't worth it. First 20 minutes of movie were interesting and after that things get pretty predictable..The ending could've been executed much better. Disappointing..There were some good lines but that was it.
110,"Due to the confusing scenario, it is not clear which hero is important for the plot and what happens to him in general. There is almost no emotional stress until the very end. There are no scrimmers either.
The first two acts are simply telling a story. At the end there is a twist that doesn't even shock.
It's a pity that such a good idea was so poorly disclosed."
111,"The more supposedly ""modern"" scenes I felt almost took away from the movie because of how they portrayed racism now a days, I can not speak for America but in Ireland a black person would not be treated like that by like 90% of the population. Overall I really did like this movie and think you should give it a chance despite my small criticism, I will say it's less of a horror though and more of a thriller, keep ya on the edge of your seat type movie. I need to add that the performance from the lead actress Janelle monáe was absolutely outstanding and took me completely into the world they had created. I felt for the character not because of how she was written but how the actress made her shine! I felt like the middle portion of the movie was a little lacklustre but it had a very strong promising start and an ending that satisfied me! I gave this a nine for the cast and the movie's premise as I think it really did have a lot of potential and it didn't completely meet my expectations but it didn't let me down either, I think it's something you need to watch for yourself."
112,Visually this movie is wonderfully shot but is let down by poor writing and direction. Scenes needlessly go on forever and do nothing to create tension but rather seem to just pad the running time. I can't help but feel this would have been a fantastic short film given a stronger writing team depth of direction. A shame really because the subject matter should have been so much more poignant and relatable.
113,The movie was make heart very statisfied and completely enjoy.. no horror.. just some little fact that happend around the world... i think it just happend in amrica.. the movie is true story i think .
114,"I went in with pretty low expectations after reading a lot of reviews. However, this movie is definitely not as bad as people say.. you can easily tell which type of people gave it bad ratings. Aka the same people who give any African American movies a bad rating. Antebellum kept me on edge throughout and the performances were amazing. 100% recommend!"
115,I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The ones who can relate to this will be the ones who understood it. This in my opinion is a warning for what could happen if people don't change their ways and views of people not like them.
116,"This movie is about the dark side of Civil War reenactments. It's about how some people take the act too far and want to bring it to life. This movie is about how large portions of America still celebrate the times before the civil war and the Confederacy, i.e. antebellum. The main character in this movie is an author, and by the end of her perils she will have another best-selling novel on her battered hands. This movie would make for a great book. The movie reminded me of Get Out or Cabin In The Woods, *bleep* happening to people in the most outrageously unexpected (or maybe expected) ways. When I was halfway through the movie I was critical of the layout, but by the end I loved it. The reason for this was foreshadowing: there's a lot of it. A few moments of foreshadowing: firstly, the burning of cotton in front of the slaves who had picked it--why burn cotton?!? (by the end that question will be answered); secondly, the very large painting in Veronica's home of a regal woman next to a horse in a long red getup--later on in the movie we see a different woman, maybe not so regal, wearing a long red getup riding a horse; thirdly, yoga. This movie recognizes beauty in subtleties.
The movie kept me hooked as I wondered about the next twist or plot point. A couple of significant thematic elements I noticed were butterflies, airplanes, and silence; although these were very explicit elements. Airplanes as a reminder of or gateway to home, technology? Butterflies represent necessary metamorphosis or symmetry? Silence is used as a mechanism for oppression.
The last 30 minutes of the film, to me, were dazzling. In saying that, I have to give credit to the first hour and fifteen minutes for establishing an august foundation to a satisfying crescendo of events at the end.
I loved that there were clear good and bad proponents. The bad were desperate to live in the past and snuff out agents of progress (the good). At one point, an antagonistic imposter, shrouded in a confederate flag prophesies something he thinks is profound, to which the protagonist t'sks, akin to a harrumph, as if to show Veronica is obviously indignant at this point in the movie. This highlights the absurdity boring the chasm that exists between good and bad, or right and wrong.
The cinematography was lovely. Half of the movie seemed as if you are viewing it through a mirky bottle of Fuji water.
The score was awesome and was a subtle fear-inducing constituent of the film. There were inherently horrific parts to the film, but I wouldn't call it a horror, I'd call it a dark mystery thriller."
117,"The premise and oft-mentioned ""twist"" are interesting, but the filmmakers failed by not conquering the burning question of ""HOW"" the situation in the film occurred.Ther transformation is missing, and it is as unforgivable as having a character ""wake up to realize it was all a dream.""Like Frankenstein's monster without the laboratory and lightning, or Cinderella without the Fairy Godmother, ANTEBELLUM doesn't go the distance to tell its story."
118,"It's not a horror movie, it is a real life drama so that makes It more horror then any other horror....Get Out is my favourite movie but Get Out is another genre and somthing different that you can't compare them...Great acting, great movie....."
119,Very stupid movie. Actually you can watch only the first and the last 10 minutes of the movie. No need to waste your time.
120,"The cinematography is good. The performance by Janelle Monaé is good too. There are a dozen unanswered questions. If you some spare time, give it a go. No horror, no sci-fi and so forth. You may be lead to believe that there may be something fresh, but no. You may walk away after 30 minutes."
121,Beautiful cinematagraphy... Terrible story and rife with a boring and overlong subplot... Seriously can anyone get pacing down without letting actors take over a worthless scene (which this one had many of)... Also wouldnt we hear airplanes constantly through this and why did that guy keep a cell phone on with no tracking signal? Super unebelievable but I guess thats why they call it the movies. Decent acting but that ending just killed the movie for me... Should have ended it totally differently.
122,"What could have been powerful social commentary in ""Antebellum"" fails to resonate the second the credits start to roll.In this psychological horror film, a successful author finds herself trapped in a horrifying reality and must uncover the mystery before it's too late.Although Janelle Monae delivers a solid performance and keeps ""Antebellum"" alive, the film struggles to figure out what it wants to be. Is this a horror film, a thriller or drama? Let's get one thing straight; there's no jump scares in this film. The real horror is slavery and you can't argue with that aspect, but will most people understand the point of ""Antebellum""? I don't know. I also thought the payout was poorly executed and felt cheap. I wanted more, needed more and I was left disappointed. Thankfully Monae is great and I look forward to seeing her in more films.Follow @snobmedia for more reviews!"
123,This is a waste of time and money. Total nonsense.
124,"I had high hopes for this movie. Released during a pandemic, numerous protests, social unrest, and seeing meaningful changes happening. The timing of Antebellum was almost ""perfect."" Or so I thought. This movie is offensive in a way that undermines everything good that has happened from the protests. This movie is so bad and perplexing especially coming from the producers of Us and Get Out. Rest assured Jordan Peele had nothing to do with this horrendous movie.At first watching this movie was a bit uncomfortable. It takes place just before the Civil War hence the name Antebellum. The Confederate soldiers were in full force. In the opening scene black slaves tried to escape and they were caught and punished. One female slave was dragged by a noose then shot. The main lead or Eden is taken to her cabin and for her punishment she is branded. She's repeated rape as well. The female slave that was killed was burned and her ashes remained in an outhouse. More slaves are brought in because hey, they keep killing the ones they have already. Eden falls asleep and awakes in modern times. Her smartphone goes off. She has a family; a loving husband and daughter. She's on TV as well having a discussion about white oppression with a man that looks eerily similar to Joe Biden. I guess they couldn't afford Alec Baldwin to play Trump in the movie. All is well or is it? I think okay there are alternate timelines or a dual reality. No, the twist makes Dumb and Dumber an Oscar worthy movie. It's that bad. There is no alternative timeline or multi-verse. The answer is much, much simpler or dumber. It's all the same timeline. You see the white daughter, mother, father, plantation owner all in modern times. You almost get the Redrum scene or feel with the little girl. You see the wokeness with the Jefferson suite, the scarlet red lipstick, plantation owner/name initials on her jewelry, the use of Eden or paradise, and Veronica talking about the ""angry black woman""; and breaking the chains of oppression by white society, using buzz words like liberation over assimilation. She's, also, selling her book, which is commercializing her plight. You get Veronica or Eden's friend say she doesn't spend enough time on herself or she's too hard on herself, while she's doing hot yoga or after a workout. She has a friend that's ""Precious"", the other is a token white friend; of course, then there's the repetition that black slaves must stay silent, say your name over and over again to Eden ( I don't know if that's referencing Roots or Destiny's Child), and Veronica wearing Ivy Park. She's Gen Z woke. One has to wonder if this movie was a made during the pandemic that the Becky reference would have changed to Karen. Then the twist happens and the ""Confederates"" kidnap Eden/Veronica. She awakes in her cabin getting raped again. But somehow a smartphone is present. Fast forward, Eden/Veronica kills the man that constantly raped her and locked the three other white men in the outhouse. She burns the men alive in the same place as the female slave. It's payback. Then she carries her ax and it sort of reminds me of Pocahontas and she's riding a horse through a Civil War reenactment in slow-motion. No, I can't make this stuff up. Then you see a large sign that gets bulldozed at the end the movie with ""Civil War Reenactment"" So you can sum up this movie as a bunch of hardcore Confederate reenactors go full throttle and do their method acting on educated African American white collar employees. The only thing missing was the burning of the Confederate flag."
125,"..neo-liberal cr*p. Modern days USA. Any tasteless, high school drama level story/acting. Laughable waste of time."
126,"I loved this movie. I felt bored with it at times, but yet I wanted to know what was going to happen. And I love the switch at the end. The entire time I thought she was recalling the past, but it was actually what was going on.I also must add that if you are in any way thinking racism doesn't exist or hasn't existed and you're still defending the rebel flag, this movie will make you question everything. I am not one who denied racism nor defended the flag, but it made me feel shame for living in a southern state and how my ancestors treated slaves and so forth."
127,"It had a very good beginning and I was actually quite intrigued as I actually did not know what the movie was about beforehand. But when the storyline switched mid movie it became obvious and predictable, and the acting also felt awkward and forced in that part of the movie. In the end it all just felt like a rushed and incomplete storyline. All in all would not recommend paying to watch this at the cinema, just wait for it to come out on netflix or something.."
128,Picks up where Us and Get Out left off. Thought provoking and appropriate for our current political climate.
129,"First of all really unfortunate that this film will not be in the theaters of the USA This in connection with the movement of black lives matter.
I did see it, in a theatre in my country Holland, and was moved shocked and the twist was very suprising. It gives a strong message about rascism long time ago and in present time. Also really empowering the black community. A must see for the people in the US and all over the world"
130,"I dose off in the 1st 10 minutes , nothing to tell really, don't go wasting your time"
131,A timely thriller that examines the horrors of people unable to let go of the past and makes us examine our current racial tensions which are made relevant in the poor reviews being left.
132,"Story same as The Village, but Antebellum was worst."
133,"That was just dumb... At first, I was rooting for the slaves. I know it used to be that way, and it's terrible. I was hoping they would revolt and kill all the soldiers. Then, it suddenly changed to present day and the past was all just a dream. The main family is a very well off black family complaining about how terrible life is for black people. For about an hour, it's just about degrading white people. Then suddenly, she's back to being a slave, but her dream was all real... Or something. It really doesn't make any sense. The acting and directing were fantastic, except for the nasty ""Precious"" girl. Her character was just disgusting. The writing/story was what really made this movie overall a waste of time."
134,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Though the concept wasn't flawlessly executed, I do appreciate it's originality. Even though it's a bit lackluster, I still suggest you check it out.From the trailer, I thought the plot would have something to do with time travel and slavery like the novel Kindred by Octavia Butler (highly recommend), however, I wasn't disappointed with the film's outcome. With better writers, the film would've gotten better reviews but this is a great film debut for music video directors, Bush & Benz. Props to them for creating a visually stunning film. Everything was aesthetically pleasing to look at, especially Janelle Monae who gave a stellar performance (compared to her previous roles)"
135,I've you guys haven't seen this movie...you missing nothing. Same old same old. This movie plays way back in time...when people used horses to travel...long before cellphones...and airplanes...then suddenly theres a cellphone...and a airplane. Atleast you get entertainment by seeing a plane and cellphone back in the days.
136,"This movie was amazing. A mix of psychological thriller elements, political views, and racial issues are incorporated in this one movie, most of it symbolized and not at all ""hit you in the head with it"" content. It makes you think, but not to the point where you aren't able to understand the basic concept. Highly recommended!"
137,"This movie takes an intriguing twist of what if and why into a dynamic ending. I recommend all of the dissenting reviewers watch the movie twice to fully grasp the complete message.Additionally, the movie answers the question of why it is important and necessary to remove these monuments of old confederate ""anarchist"". As I watched this movie, it made me think about all of the liberties that black americans have just began to enjoy and how relatively recent the institution of jim crow and even slavery was the accepted law of the land. There are so many things to learn and relate to throughout this masterpiece. Again, if you don't get it, watch it again, and then if you don't get it open your eyes and read a raw history book of the black americans from 1619 to 2020."
138,"I never take the time to review movies, but this one truly deserves it. I knew going in it was going to be tough to watch due to the subject matter and it was. But the film just grabs ahold of you and never lets go. I thought the $20 it cost On Demand was well worth it. I'm super stingy with my 10s so I gave it a 9. This is a definite must see film!"
139,"I'm glad I didn't read anything about this movie before watching it, and certainly not all those extremely negative reviews on here. I wouldn't read anything if I were you so you'll be as surprised as I was when the twists and turns unfolds. Because even if I was surprised and mostly sceptic in the beginning of the first turn I have to admit that was some clever writing from Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. I didn't see it coming at all and that's what makes it even better. I don't know why people have to compare it to the things that happen in real life now, it's pointless, it's a movie, nothing else, but a pretty good one. The acting was very good from the whole cast, the directing and cinematography on top, and the story surprising, engaging, and mysterious. One of the better movies I've seen in a long time and I watch two to three movies every day. You could compare it to Get Out for the theme, but it's a totally different story, so I wouldn't."
140,"Feels like Get Out and Us, but screenplay editing is brilliant!"
141,Even a year a go I wouldn't have bought this premise but after trump as president and what I've witnessed these last few years I know my thought of what America is was a fraud. Not going to delve into why but let's just say racism is alive and prospering in America. Now the film I remember the trailer and I to thought it was entirely a different movie than what I saw but if I grade it on its merits it's a solid 9 almost a 10. I figured out the twist but didnt matter it's a phenomenal film and a shame people dont see that. Extremely Underrated and entertaining I will watch what these directors/writers do in the future. P.S. its WAY better than the village!! And although it does have some horrible things happen I'd classify it as a thriller/ drama.
142,"It's easy to get the wrong idea about this movie. It's promoted and directed to be misunderstood, and that's a damn shame (and a mystery), because it is a good movie, if the audience knows the correct premise for it. So allow me to give it to you. It's not a spoiler, it's a necessity to really enjoy it!This movie seems to be telling two parallel stories about two black women, played by the same actress. One of them is a confederate 19th century slave, and the other is a successful modern woman. Seems to. It's false.
This is really a thriller about the kidnapping of a successful modern black woman, and many other black folks, who are forced into slavery by some maniacs reenacting the civil war, in a hidden location somewhere in today's US south.Hope this gives you a more enjoyable experience."
143,"Incredible film. I watched this without knowing anything about it and it had me on the edge of my seat the whole time wondering what was going on. The twist when it came had me yelling out WTF Over and over again as the implications of what had happened prior all fell into place. Well done, amazing. Only downside is that the trailer (which I watched afterwards) gives away a lot of the movie and it would have been better to keep us in the dark."
144,"This movie was suspenseful. Of course SOME people wouldn't see this as horror. For 13% of us, it is. Even if it isn't considered horror it is extremely suspenseful. I had no idea what was happening. There were emotional scenes that sucked me in."
145,"I was so excited to see this movie and it was so disappointing. The concept was pretty good, but the execution ruined the entire movie. There were so many unnecessary scenes that had absolutely nothing to do with the plot and when it's finally revealed that they are all slaves in a modern world and decide to escape, there is an expectation of an epic escape and vengeance against those responsible and it's just boring and fairly uneventful."
146,"In my opinion, this could have been way more deep, intense. Especially in lieu of current events. Monae was strong, no surprise there, but the writing was weak. Cliche stereotypes, cartoonish oafish bad guys. I had hoped for a thrilling vehicle that would tackle racism head on, after all, the Confederate flag represents the darkest most evil time in our history. Given the opportunity to really go for it, the writers of this film failed miserably. This could have been and should have been epic, too bad. An ok watch once, definitely not a keeper."
147,"Greetings again from the darkness. This is the movie for anyone unaware that racism was prevalent during the Civil War, and still continues to this day. Of course anyone fitting that description is likely enjoying their life in a cave, and is clueless that movies exist. It even goes as far to ""inform"" us that slaves were abused, tortured, and lynched, while today racism can take the more subtle form of a less desirable restaurant table or a concierge with an attitude. However, while the message may be unnecessary and too obvious, the originality and creative approach of filmmakers Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz is commendable, especially for their first feature film.An uninterrupted extended take kicks off the movie, and shows us the lay of the land at a cotton plantation where the slaves are controlled by confederate soldiers. When an attempted escape goes wrong, the brutality of the soldiers is on display. One of the slaves is Eden, played by Janelle Monae. She's the favorite of the General (Eric Lange, seen recently in two popular cable mini-series, ""Escape at Dannemora"" and ""Perry Mason""), and he literally brands her as his property. Many of the sequences are difficult to watch as the cruelty and abuse is not sugar-coated.When we next see Ms. Monae wake up from a dream, she's living in a swanky home with a perfect husband (Marque Richardson) and cute daughter. She's now Veronica, a well-known author and speaker who is living the American dream. A night on the town with her friends played by Gabourey Sidibe (Oscar nominated for PRECIOUS, 2009) and Lily Cowles purposefully comes across like it's from a different movie altogether. It's this contrast the filmmakers use to deliver their M Night Shyamalan style twist. Afterwards, it's wheels-off for the movie, but we are able to assemble the pieces of what we've seen to this point.Jena Malone and Jack Huston also play key roles here, but it's Ms. Monae who gets the majority of the screen time, and mostly nails both Eden and Veronica. Although much of the film and story seems exaggerated and over-played, cinematographer Pedro Luque (THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER'S WEB, 2018) delivers a beautifully shot film, so it always looks good, regardless of what else we might be thinking. Filmmakers Bush and Renz likely have much more nuanced and effective storytelling in their future, and we do expect Ms. Monae to take the step from supporting roles to leads. She's earned it."
148,"So I finally got around to seeing this and I can see why it got such bad reviews and some people are offended by it. I myself just thought it was meh. Intriguing concept, overly mediocre execution with some unintentionally goofy moments, strained performances but gorgeous cinematography and a great score. As implausible as it is conceptually it's ambitious and does spark conversation but it's kind of all over the place and never decides on what kind of movie it wants to be to it's own detriment. With a little more focus it could've been something more substantial and not so generic.**.5/5
Eric: 3/5"
149,"This was sloppy. I expect more from the people behind this that have delivered amazing films and could even say, have changed the horror flick game. Not to be said here, though. Had it not been for the confusion of the films sequence, I would have fallen asleep ten times before the cliche ending. I was hoping for more I guess. It wasn't bad....but it wasn't fckng amazing either-"
150,"The low ratings are most likely in the main given by that group of homo sapiens that in no way qualify to be called human beings.
I was expecting some form of Sliding Doors French Lieutenants Woman movie but was very pleasantly surprised when it revealed itself to be a refreshingly original take on the dark brown person vs sub human situation."
151,While the movie is worth a watch. I really fee a re-edit of the movie would improve the over all. The jump and twist is to early and takes you from the concept of the movie. Though I think part 2 could be done much better.
152,"There isn't hardly a scene in this move that doesn't portray blatant racism. Does this make a pretty & sweet movie to watch? Maybe not, but we need to turn up volume for those who done hear very well in this day and age."
153,"""Antebellum"" is a tough movie to watch AND review. It's depiction of slavery is brutal, but the twist that brings it into genre territory is badly timed and ultimately disappointing."
154,Janelle Monáe never disappoints. Great storyline but the cinematography was imperfect. The racist are too illiterate to appreciate the implications of the movie scenarios and acknowledge that America has been Humane to certain groups of people so long(Since 1619) that it's the norm for the oppressor and the oppressed!
155,"Actually, this movie really good to watch , it was stunning by Music, Screenplay, Acting and Twists.
I didnt sleep well for 2 days after i saw this movie!!
Very decent movie, Very decent screenplay, ...
People should watch these kind movies to treat and respect all human beings!"
156,"This movie was awesome and eye opening. It reminds to never be complacent. ""We"" always have to strive for equality and ensure that if this ever were to happen, be prepared. Man! It was great!"
157,"The only thing horrifying is the waste of time you spend watching this pathetic revenge fantasy. It plods along with nothing interesting ever happening.The acting itself was bad (Janelle Monae did ok as a singer being an actress), but there are serious disconnects in the supporting cast. If all the ""slaves"" were kidnapped, why were they so docile? You would think there would be a more active attempt to escape captivity.As for the rest of the movie, it doesn't really go into WHY there's this group of white people kidnapping blacks and playing Confederacy at a Civil War reenactment site or how they keep it a secret.No one should waste their time or money to watch this horrifying mess."
158,This is stupid worst movie of 2020 without any plot or story. The writer just used situation happening in our US right now and just made a movie without logic or sense. I like screenplay but c'mon man they made a camp or small town in a jungle which is 1 hour away from city with proper border and guards yet no one knew about it how dumb you can be
159,"Not weird to see the bias in which some people review this movie.
Racism is far from over."
160,"Should probably take a good look at who they really are. It was a social statement. The acting and writing could have been better though. Seriously, if you think this is ""anti white"", PLEASE just call yourself what you really are... a racist. Bc we REALLY DID do this to people, based on something so topical as the color of their skin. For YEARS. Understand that. Admit that. Our history is corroded with xenophobia, racism, homophobia, and bigotry, and still are. The minute WE, as a society accept this FACT, and transform into better humans, is the day we evolve. If not, this movie scenario could absolutely be our society's fate. And I refuse for that happen. And everyone else should too. #blmornolivesmatter"
161,I get the point that Antebellum tries to make. But.. Sorry..
162,"I expected to see a horror movie, not another excuse to rehash some feminist ideology. I stopped around 40 minutes, at the speech against patriarchy and without having felt anything else than boredom. Hollywood should think about writing good scripts before fulfilling some political agenda"
163,"The movie is nice and good..wish they have elaborate more the background of the villains and their purpose and how they got to pick their victims...
They couldve broaden the story further...
Other than that the movie surprise me.
Cause ive read bad reviews and was hesitant at first glad that id gave it a try...nice!"
164,"1 hour and 8 minutes later I still didn't have a clue about the movie but when I did, the second half of it was awesome. This is something that can happen in these modern times and gives me some chills when I even think about it. Great acting and plot and kinda bad movie to watch these days considering the recent happenings."
165,"Fast forwarding to the end.....does this take place before or after Veronica/Eden is shot in the head in the SUV? When Veronica is undressing to take a shower, the branding is not there...was this removed? Why are the people behaving as if they were born into slavery as opposed to being kidnapped in modern times?! These folks picked the cotton and then turned around and immediately burned the cotton (while others were SIMULTANEOUSLY still picking cotton)....but, if they were enslaved to pick cotton.....see where I'm going? Nobody......not ONE of them thought this odd? As if being kidnapped and forced into slavery isn't odd enough. Smh. It's no for me, dog. Please, don't waste your time on this one. Unless, of course, you're the type who enjoy nails scratching blackboards."
166,"I'd like to start by saying I don't find the trailer at all misleading. I went in expecting the plot that more or less played out. I do agree that ""horror"" is not really the right genre to categorized this movie. I would say it's more like a psychological thriller.I'm actually between a 7 and an 8 on this film. I went with the 7 because I do believe there is a lot more that could have been done in this story. That being said, I definitely think this would have been better suited for.a limited run series. With a series, they could have used the great slow burn vibe they achieve early in the movie. It feels to me like we're getting an abridged version. My primary disappointment with the film is that I wanted a more fulfilling ending. The ending, at least to me, was in no way confusing but rather just lacking in a no-loose-ends ending (call me mentally lazy, I get it!)."
167,"I like many others had a different type of movie in mind when we saw this. I think it's very misleading to pull a bait & switch on your audience by promoting one type of film an then delivering something completely different. That said, the HORROR shown I this movie was of a historical nature-the brutality that slavery WAS in our country in the South. There ARE monsters but they are the slave owners who own the plantations and torment the slaves. It makes me so sad to see Black Americans being treated that way. That was the worst time in the USA and it breaks my heart. Racism of any kind is repulsive and should never be tolerated by anyone. We are all equal and deserve love, respect and kindness."
168,"Someone posted here that people who didn't like this movie should be ashamed of themselves. I say to that person, get over yourself. Who appointed you to be a moral judge?Well, I am not ashamed to say that I didn't like this movie, but I didn't like it for a slightly different reason. Movies about human suffering are important. They are lessons to all of us. Movies that go on and on and on, keep showing never ending stream of abuse and humiliation and suffering, that gets not only unpleasant but it also gets boring in a hurry. That's how I felt about Antebellum. I got bored very quickly, and when I learned what that place really was I began to press skip forward button on my remote. It was pretty obvious what was going to happen next. Bad guys were all going to die a horrible death and the good guy is going to win.If it weren't for some of this movie's better moments I would have just turned it off and gone back to watching French Open.What better moments? There were two of them. The opening scene was really good. Also, I liked the main character. She was really good. It was because of her and the opening scene I gave this movie 3 stars instead of 1.If you enjoy movies about human suffering, find something else to watch. This one is not good at all."
169,"Truthfully this movie shouldn't have been released. It could've been so good if it was longer and developed, if it had a proper ending and middle. The beginning started off really good. Paying 20 bucks for this movie was not worth it, it could've been sooo much better. So I say it had to be the covid that had to stop the details of the movie. If so..they should've waited till 2022 because I truly believe this would've been a banger some good acting and then some that should've been reformed..in my opinion..but yea. Wish they would redo it. I would watch again for sure"
170,So much talent in front of the camera yet such a dissatisfying feeling of regret for even watching this misleading mess of a film.
171,"Very poor film, long and boring, idea maybe good but implementation very bed."
172,"First of all let me say this is my first review on IMDB and I´ve made it because I never felt so fooled/tricked with a movie.Saw this movie with wife and kids all thinking it is somehow in the same line of ""us"" and ""get out"" (since it´s advertised in the trailer it was from the same director of those nice movies), but we were tricked by that, by the trailer and also by the category ""horror"" (how that categorizations were defined and how someone could say this is an ""horror"" movie?).The trailer is really for tricking the persons to think it´s an horror movie, the part where a little blond girl appears in a corridor is the best to understand and you can confirm when you see the movie... it´s clear that this scene is put in the movie just to be in the trailer.Gave 3 stars for some shooting scenes very beautifully made and the music which is intense but that is not what makes a good movie."
173,"I was very underwhelmed by this film. I expected it to be in the same league as Get Out or Us but it lacked the intensity, thrill and acting chops of those films. It really fell flat in a lot of places and sailed that way through the whole film. It had a flaccid ending that was actually quite laughable. And the 'twist'? Not good enough for my liking. Having said that I saw one critic review saying it was the worst film of 2020 which is far from true. It's not great by it's by far not the worst."
174,"I say this because that's what I kept saying through the first half of the movie. My first issue is that it was billed as a horror- so that's what I'm expecting to see, so that was a major disappointment. After getting over that I found the story interesting and entertaining enough to not be disappointed in purchasing it."
175,"For those who have a problem with this film should really take the time to wonder why they are such critics of it. The movie depicted how black people lived not for just a segment of their life but for their entire life. Imagine this being your every waking day! What could be more horrible? This films cinematography was extremely well done, suspenseful and thought provoking. The turns and twists was a fresh take on depicting the what ifs. I only regret that I did not get to see this at the theatre. I would pay more than I already have to see this again."
176,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The first half had me mixed with emotions and the second half had me admiring their work. Mone knocked it out the park with her acting and I hope to see more of her in years to come. Well worth the rental. So many themes to reflect on. How humanity treats each other. How fear and deep insecurity destroys everyone white and black. I love how the scene with the little girl is played out throughout the movie. Are you going to be friends? The degree to which we hate each other and ourselves is also captured masterfully. The way masochistic behavior destroy lives. Excellent! And let's not forget the gender role reversals, white privilege, and denial revealed. This was a horror movie and thrilling to imagine how much of this takes place today."
177,"Seems like white people don't like seeing themselves as real villains.This movie was incredible and gave me the same fears ""Get Out"" did. Watch it for yourself."
178,"The acting was fantastic, although I found Gabourey's character both hysterical and annoying, but seemingly expected... The storyline was well written but expected based on the trailer. I'm not sure why reviewers gave this such a poor review. Considering the fact that Get Out is scientifically impossible, the plausibility that this story could happen today should have made it more terrifying... The reviews saying it was gory is insane considering I watch the Halloween and Hellraiser films for fun. Maybe it's the truth behind the horror that makes people upset. The context of this film and the thoughts that flooded my mind after seeing it makes my heart hurt which is why it's hard to say I love this film. I'm happy it's out here for the world but the content hurts the strains of my DNA. For white and black children who think the plantation era is so distant in the past and hard to visualize, it's a perfect film to show the true nature of this countries history and the glorification that's still reenacted. I'm glad I spent $20 to rent this movie and I'll be paying another $20+ to buy it. Well done!"
179,The trailer did mislead but overall Janelle Monae and the others did an amazing job in this film. It somewhat reminds me of Get Out & US. You really have to pay attention to the movie to catch all the plot twists and clues. It's not a horror movie. It's more of a thriller type movie. But this movie was amazing. I don't know what some of you all are talking about! LOVED IT!!
180,"I really liked the story, something unique I must say..the movie idea and actors work is very well done. Dont know what is with the low reviews but im telling you that is a worth watching movie with a twisted story which will make you question the world we live in. Definitely one of the best movies of the year...as I saw lesser and lesser good movies lately!"
181,Now this is a movie!!! This movie had my full attention! I was not expecting any of this!
182,"Love the movie and looking at all white critics trying to make the movie looks bad makes it even better. Hitting it hard where needed. It may not be a perfect movie as per the elements of cinema but the message it gives is clear, subtle jabs at black folks and the treatment they receive is not exactly equal to a white counterpart. Very apt considering current situation in the USA and government's response towards it."
183,The director created a movie that able to put things into perspective.The fact is when we look back in history we are are unable to relate fully. We use excuses those times or that's what it was.This movie allows one to truly connect with the horrors of past crimes.Well done sir
184,Awful. I wanted more. Expected more. Needed more. Should've had more.
185,"I can't believe the bad reviews, certain ppl should feel ashamed or you belong in the shed."
186,"Horror genre sometimes provides real time conflicts in a surreal, or over the top hyper dramatic way. Or Supernatural beings, monsters and the like. And this movie falls into the same category as the Saw franchise or Get Out. Modern horror is rarely ever one thing.
This movie delivers strong characters with acting from multi award winning actors, solid writing, and as others have mentioned skillfully executed cinematography.
Absolutely baffled by the low ratings. I am normally not a horror fan, because it's extremely difficult to do well and rarely is, most horror is abysmal. With twisty tones of sassy Tarantino characters, Antebellum is a subtley nuanced horror masterpiece."
187,Janelle was amazing in this movie! The fear of the twist actually happening in real life makes this movie a horror film!
188,"This movie is so original, so well made, acting is superb, scenes Are powerful and breathtaking! Why the low rating???
It's not the usual horror movie you'll see, but is is very smart, and the thought that This could realy happen, is horrific!
Watch this movie!"
189,"As far as I know this movie has always been marketed as a thriller and as such it delivers but not in the way we are used to. The film leans heavily into the one-sided view of a culture and ethnicity that majority will not understand. This movie is not great because it does that, but because it is unapologetic and raw about its deliverance. Some people are saying its riding the wave of racism enlightenment but like 42, Black Panther, Woke, Get Out and Atlanta, this is the movie we need right now and does not hold back."
190,"Apparently this movie is polarizing... I just enjoyed myself. I will agree it's more suspense and drama than horror, but I'm guessing whoever says it's not horror was not told ""you were bought and you were sold"" as a child. Thank you to the makers. See it!"
191,"I initially thought the movie was trashy because I was confused as hell But as everything begin to come together, I realized it was a great concept. If you like movies like Sixth Sense and The Others, you will love this movie. The purpose of the movie was not to give away the plot. If ppl have a problem with the racial undertones or depictions of slavery, YOU ARE THE PROBLEM!!! If you don't believe things like this could happen, wake up. we have seen news stories with neighbors doing the most."
192,"As the quote from William Faulkner in the beginning states, the past isn't even past. Making sure to keep that in mind as the film began in an attempt to figure out what was going on before the big reveal is fully explained to the audience, I'll be completely honest and say that even when a minor reveal happened I still didn't entirely get what was happening. Starring Janelle Monae as Veronica as well as ""Eden"", Kiersey Clemons as Julia, Gabourey Sidibe as Dawn, Eric Lange as the General or ""Him"", Jack Huston as Captain Jasper, and Jena Malone as Elizabeth, Antebellum is a very polarizing film for a lot of people as a lot of people are either trashing this film for having what they view as a misleading trailer, an attempt to glorify slavery or at least the Antebellum South, or just another heavy-handed slave movie invoking white guilt ridden audiences and showing how evil it was and how they are complicit in the modern day repercussions through their obliviousness to their ""white privilege"". However I firmly believe that it is none of those things.Evoking imagery from other more famous horror, thriller, or slavery movies such as The Shining, The Village, 12 years a slave, and perhaps most notably and justifiably, the Jordan Peele 2017 black social thriller ""Get Out"" through which numerous comparisons have already been made, ""Antebellum"" has shades of all of those films but also much more to bring to the table. Following the main character, a successful, a renowned sociologist, author, and public speaker who also happens to be a black woman, something which in and of itself, some certain individuals find threatening enough to their pre-conceived notions of order in American society.In addition to her role as Veronica she also plays Dawn, a slave woman living on a plantation in the Antebellum South in what appears to be the midst of the Civil War. Alongside fellow slaves Eli (Tongayi Chirisa) and pregnant Julia (Kiersey Clemons) all of whom seem to strangely unaccustomed to life on a slave plantation, the general confusion, chaos, and seeming anachronistic elements and dialogue thrown in to the mix seem to hint that something far more inexplicable and horrific is going on, even in the context of an already sinister situation, as certain characters seem to be present in BOTH settings, perhaps hinting that there is time travel or something supernatural going on. The cinematography and score are incredibly evocative and beautiful to look at, in addition to the costume design which accurately portrays the fairly elegant if not over the top clothing the slave owners and their families wore during the time period with all of the fancy lace and crinoline you would expect giving them all an air of false affability, particularly Elizabeth played with cold conviction by Jena Malone, her character intentionally evoking Scarlett O'Hara from Gone with the Wind, in spite of the various horrors being inflicted on the enslaved men and women by the Confederate soldiers on the plantation. They are under the brutal command of the General and Captain Jasper, a cruel and sadistic overseer who seems to take great pleasure in making sure all of the slaves are as miserable as humanly possible while working in the fields.While some scenes are very difficult to watch, despite the horrific events which unfold over the nearly two hour running time, the film itself is rarely all that frightening in regards to building tension and atmosphere and could be likened to more as a drama or thriller despite being marketed as a horror. In both time periods the emphasis on the interwoven nature of the past and present is constantly shown, often in very unpleasant scenarios whether it be Veronica's friend Dawn berating a waitress about attempting to seat her and her party of three in a poorly lit corner of a fancy restaurant or a white hotel receptionist giving Veronica an unnecessarily rude and flippant attitude when she attempts to book a room in an upscale hotel, the concept of microaggressions comes to mind, as well as the false idea of the notion that we are living in a post racial society.As evidence has shown from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and the BLM protests, are all of the evidence society at large needs to know that while progress definitely has been made since the Civil Rights era, we are still far from a truly post racial America, a truth this film hits home far more bluntly than many people would like it seems, while there are of course some flaws to be found such as ""preachy"" dialogue and writing which can also be described as heavy-handed or pretentious to many viewers I think that overall this film's strengths vastly outweighs it's weaknesses, and it's also definitely a film which needs to be watched more than once, much like the movie Get Out, from both the perspective of a first viewer trying to figure out just what the hell is going on, and a second time viewer spotting vital clues and imagery that they might have missed or ignored the first time around. Would definitely recommend a watch, preferably with friends and in the comfort of your own home."
193,All these bade reviews make no sense a lot of hating . The movie added a twist to the average slavery movie you would usually watch and presents symbols that you really have to watch for. It had a fresh feel to it.
194,The way this movie starts you are put into a sense of complancy in terms of its time frame and in that is its brilliance really relevant with what's going on in the world now. Great story telling with awesome twist.
195,This is one of the best and most relevant movies that I've seen in a very long time. The PLOT TWIST in Amazing & totally unexpected! Wow!!!
196,"I really never have an expectation when I pick a film so I'm never really disappointed. And this film did not disappoint me, at all. It was a thriller with a twist. What's always odd to me is anytime a film depicts slavery, folks don't like it. But it is OUR HISTORY and in this case, without providing spoilers, could well happen in dese ole United States today. Just look out of your windows or watch your television.I've told all of my friends to watch it, get past the first 20 minutes and then settle in for a rather different kind of movie ride. This film is like no other but is LONG OVERDUE. Nobody wants to be reminded of slavery, much less on the big screen. BELOVED was mystical, a thriller and showed the brutality of slavery. And the public hated it. But for those of us who heard the stories as children from our grandparents or great grandparents, we definitely understood the historical value of the movie.I totally disagree with the naysayers. Give the movie a try! There is a faction out there who will ""get it""."
197,"Don't watch the trailer if you wanna see the movie.
I was really dissapointed because the story in the trailer is absolutly not comparable with the movie!
It is not a horror movie, even not a triller!
A simple drama..."
198,"If you'd seen any of the trailers or marketing for Antebellum in the previous few months you'd be excused for thinking this was a genuine horror film with mind-bending plot twists but the film we have now as a finished product is sure to leave many confused and disappointed despite there being a great concept deep down somewhere in this messy offering.A visually splendid film that starts off in great fashion only to turn into a forty plus minute experience in slavery torture drama 101, that then transforms into a modern day stretch that will test the patience of even the most patient and undemanding of viewers, Antebellum squanders its chance to deliver something profound and unexpected as it heads on its way to The Village like territory of genre filmmaking where we spend far too long on a journey to a pay-off that will cause further frustrations rather than celebrations.Music video directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz try their best to enliven proceedings with some great visual flourishes and some moody set-pieces but their interesting work behind the camera is unable to make amends for the films lack of good characters or development, shoddy pacing and a tension free feeling despite the films thriller and horror elements rearing their heads occasionally throughout the films arduous runtime.Front and centre for most of the film is rising star Janelle Monae who gets duel roles as modern day author Veronica and slavery era Eden, in what acts as a disappointing chance for the talented performer to showcase her skills on the big stage.Originally intended for a semi high profile cinematic run that was scuttled at the last minute in favour of a safer bet via a VOD release in many key markets, Antebellum could've been Monae's big break after noted turns in the likes of Hidden Figures, Moonlight and Harriet but she has little to work with here with both Veronica and Eden rather cold figures, both of whom are unable to capture us in any significant way.As we viewers trudge through the hard to bare film's opening and middle sections, there's a faint hope that where we are being taken too is going to make it all worth it but with Gabourey Sidibe's detestable supporting turn as one of Veronica's closest friends fresh in our mind and a realization that most of the films screen time is nothing but wasted reels of film, Antebellum's lackluster ending sums up a film that was unable to create any magic around its intriguing central idea.Final Say -Neither a horror or a thriller that can provide any actual thrills, Antebellum wants to be a genre film with a message but all it ends up achieving is a resounding sense of a missed opportunities.1 mobile phone out of 5"
199,"The Good: This is a movie you should go into not knowing anything. It'll make it more enjoyable. The ending works very well in making you reexamine what you've seen and look at it in a different light. It makes earlier scenes work a lot better when you know the full story. This is the main reason for the higher rating -- that's a really impressive feat even though this also adds some likelihood questions. The story also does a really good job of driving the audience to discuss several issues after the film ends.The Bad: Some clunky dialogue. Some over acting in parts. Some scenes were too long. Although I enjoyed the ending, it brings up some questions of plausibility. Not a lot of character development -- I personally never felt too connected to any of the characters -- interestingly though, I still cared about the outcome."
200,"Structurally Antebellum is a re-make of Shyamalan's The Village with some elements of Get Out.The first 40 minutes are just beautifully shot Oscars material (with typical stereotypes that seriously boost your chances of winning an oscar, like maniacal misogynistic white men rapists), then around 30 minutes of overacting and boring dialogue on the current political agenda. At times the film looks like it's trying to be smart and dive deeper into the ongoing social issues, but no, not really. It is very much surface level.The story finally picks up in the last 20 minutes or so, by that time the resolution becomes obvious and you're just waiting for the film to wrap up.There is some clever writing and good cinematography in this, but in the end, it turns into a very simplistic story made only to gain free points and awards.I mostly skip politically fueled oscar vehicles because I don't enjoy my mind being assaulted by surface-level propaganda, so I watched it only because it was mismarketed as a horror film, I can't say I'm disappointed, but it had the potential of being something more complicated and deep, but instead, they just wasted time on comical acting and horrendous dialogue."
201,"This movie definitely reflects the world we live in. The message of the film was significant to mainstream issue that has plagued American culture since Columbus supposedly discovered America. Before I watched the film I read many reviews and many were negative and gave a low rank. I almost did not watch it because of that, however, I still chose to watch it and be my own judge. The film is one of the best I have seen this year. The cinematography was phenomenal and the characters drew you in. I can say this is one of very few films I have given a 10. Anyone giving this film a low score are oblivious to racism and most likely never experienced it."
202,"I don't agree with anyone giving this movie anything less than 7 stars. Like what did you watch? This was a great from start to finish. And if you're triggered about race relations, I'm assuming you haven't watched what's going on in the past 4 years. I bet these same people who didn't like Antebellum liked The Hunt. Anyways, solid script, great acting, terrific plot, well done. Will be purchasing this as soon as possible."
203,Just because M. Night Shyamalan did it 15 years ago doesn't mean we've forgotten. If this would have been an original concept it would have been way better. The Village for the win.
204,"I rented this movie just to see Janelle Monáe and Jena Malone. Both are great performers and very underrated. For those complaining about the movie are just too scared to face the truth of the past. Yes slavery happened, let's learn about it, accept it, and let's make today and tomorrow better than what was in the past, together."
205,"I loved the movie, very entertaining sure some things could have been better and the trailer was kind of misleading, but I liked that the trailer was misleading and not the same old scenario meaning we see the whole movie within the trailer!I'm convinced that the people who are leaving the negative comments are doing so simply because they either don't want to support the directors because of (HATE) or they believe that some how this fictitious movie is supporting (BLM) in some ways that they've put together in the wasteland manufacturing sites in which they call their (minds).We do not live in a fairytale and you can't erase history so if you have a problem with the portrayal of the Caucasian characters in this movie it leads me to believe that either you don't know about the very real very atrocious acts that were committed against people of color or ya just don't care. Either way the movie is very entertaining, very fictitious and probably not meant for you to take as problematic simply because you are having a hard time coping with the realities of (2020)."
206,"This movie was a complete waste. Talented people involved, and there wasn't much they could do to rescue this atrocity from itself. Very similar to hiring the worlds best chefs, tasked with preparing a delicious main course using only human feces. A hopeless endeavor to say the least..."
207,"Antebellum checks out as a movie that starts with a vibrant mood and goes on while keeping a steady pace. The performance of the actors gets blend with every act. The film follows a story from start to finish that doesn't excite us or make us curious at any point. The first two acts of the film try to uplift itself but fail imminently. The third act of the movie tries to set up some prominent meanings but fails to do so. Overall Antebellum is a movie that doesn't deliver anything worthy of your time. In the end, it joins the one-time watch club."
208,"I wrote a review stating this movie was insulting. Didn't use any bad words just gave my opinion of the film, but somehow it was deemed inappropriate. Welcome to communist America."
209,"By turns both depressing and hilarious reading many of the reviewers on here trying to disguise their blatant racism as film critique. Not original? There were at least three genuine ""WHAT THE....??!?"" moments in this fantastic edge of the seat thriller / polemic, all brilliantly executed and beautifully shot. And of course Janelle Monae is a WONDER!"
210,"This is a movie for thinking, mature adults. It is also not for haters, It is not a movie for quick thrills, and instant satisfaction. It makes you think. It gets in your mind and forces you to consider what you just saw and the meanings of the images. This movie is loaded with symbolisms and symbols, hidden meanings, and foreshadowing. A wonderful movie. We need more of these."
211,How can someone rare this movie anything less than 7?
212,"Antebellum is a movie that would have been much better if I'd never seen the trailer and if the big reveal didn't happen until much later in the movie. As it stands, it's still interesting, but it would have really knocked me out if I had no idea what I was in store for. So that's why I'm giving you the opportunity to look away now, because you deserve to see this with no expectations.Eden (Janelle Monáe) is a slave who has tried to escape before and bears the brand of her owner, Him (Eric Lange). When another girl named Julia (Kiersey Clemons) hangs herself - killing both herself and her unborn child - after the treatment she endures and Eden is again assaulted by Him, she falls asleep.Seriously, spoilers.Eden is really Veronica Henley, a sociologist promoting her new book along with her friends - it's nice to see Gabourey Sidibe in this - when she's targeted by Elizabeth (Jena Malone) and her husband Jasper (Jack Hutton), drugged and taken to the plantation, which exists underknown to the rest of the modern world.Now that she is part of the past - or at least a re-enactment of it - Eden/Veronica must escape or die.Writers, directors and producers Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz have mostly worked in shorts before this, but the film has some moment of real slow motion beauty that was filmed using the actual lenses from Gone with the Wind.Basically, consider this a woke The Village, except that movie had the sense to wait until - again - the close before the twist. That said, I wasn't bored by this, but the times we meet Veronica, she seems much less likable than Eden.Regardless, any time that women of color can be the lead in any movie - much less a horror film - is a reason to celebrate. Check it out for yourself - it's yet another movie where a woman done wrong sets a house on fire and walks away in slow motion - and let me know what you think."
213,"The overall rating is relatively low. I guess some audience feel disturbing from political perspective. On the contrary, it is a film engaging me from start to finish though I feel depressed by all torture things. I naturally follow the flow and become obsessed about the past and present reincarnation.Just one thing the ending ended in an abrupt way which destroying the ingenuity built up by the previous part. I personally think that the first part of the movie is quite good, but the last ten minutes looks comical."
214,Movie was ok could have been better. Really slow film that did not deliver. Also definitely not a thriller or horror film. so many unanswered questions.
215,"Antebellum is a very well shot film, but the story and message end up being disappointingly vacuous, as nothing comes together in any sort of meaningful way. This film is missing a second act and features some performances that needed to be reeled in (Jena Malone's teeth must be ruined from chewing so hard on the scenery).The potential was there and the stage was set, but the directors and writers clearly had nothing to say, which made the film end rather cartoonishly."
216,"""The unresolved past can certainly wreak havoc on the present.""Oh no. What happened here? Honestly, from the trailers this looked like it would be something interesting. Maybe not the most amazing movie ever but at least something fine. It could be the competition to make a movie better than Jordan Peele, but Antebellum is trying to be something smarter than it actually is. While trying to make a statement about social issues on racism, the message comes out more basic. Much like Green Book, the message says, ""Racism is bad and it needs to end!"" Though many have mixed feelings on it after the controversy and how it really didn't say much else than that statement, Green Book had structure and an engaging story. Antebellum can't even do that.To engage audiences, the movie has major twists. Many, myself included, have compared these twists to an M. Night Shyamalan movie. I don't know whether to say who did it better but Antebellum failed to make the twists as mind blowing as The Sixth Sense it even The Village. The first attempt as a twist made me laugh because I thought they were doing something else. Luckily what we think is happening actually isn't happening. But it's not that great either.I questioned what was actually happening so much in the second act that I couldn't stop watching. I didn't mind the second act too much. It's far more interesting than the first act. I might get some hate for criticizing the first act, but it did nothing special. They made the most basic slavery movie right there with the script and what is happening. Not that what we're watching isn't extremely disappointing to watch in U.S. history, but no attempt is made to make something greater if it. The third act is just a mess. Once everything comes together it's sort of unbelievable what we're watching. And the message that's made maybe came off the wrong foot, I hope. If they intended to make a statement through this revenge aspect it's maybe not the best way to put it. Honestly I was concerned. Anyway, the final moments are just crazy. A heroic moment is just more confusing or something. I honestly just have no words because I don't know how to describe everything.This is disappointing because there's a waste of talent. All of the performances are actually pretty good. Going in I didn't realize Jena Malone had a part. It's always great to see her in a movie because she's a wonderful actress. And for Janelle Monáe this could've been a movie to send her into Hollywood's eye. She hasn't been in too many movies and Antebellum is her first lead. She really nails the role. I'd even consider her in the top ten actress performances of the year. But it's sad since this is a train wreck. The cinematography looks great, especially the final moments. The score is good. Technically and acting-wise, a good movie. Directing and writing-wise, awful. It's for the best that this went to VOD. With hardly making any money and scathing reviews, a definite flop for 2020."
217,"In the past couple of decades I've seen maybe two movies with similar plot structures, but different storylines. In a unique way we see a strong statement about racism in America (although to be fair, it exists in every country with their own marginalized racial/ethnic group (s)).
Cannot really say much about the movie w/out giving it away. On the positive side the acting was good; the story moved along well & offered another perspective on the issue. On the negative side escaping should have been easier especially w/intelligent decisions that could have been made. Seemed overbalanced w/nothing but cruelty. Slaves were expensive & killing, injuring, and extreme misery was economically not likely."
218,"This is a remarkable movie which gave me goose bumps! Beautiful cinematography, wonderful story development and powerful execution made it riveting"
219,"It is very rare that I find myself feeling such raw emotion at a movie. This movie was thrilling, terrifying, and mind boggling all at the same time. I was constantly trying to figure out what was going to happen next, but the twists and turns kept me on the edge of my seat. Monáe did a fantastic job in this role. Would suggest to anyone and everyone open to recommendations."
220,"I went into this thinking this was going to be set in modern time, then something bad happens and she gets sent back to the past to be a slave. NOT AT ALL WHAT HAPPENED. The trailer was basically just clickbait. I was expecting a good plot and climax, but it was all just lead-up. Yes, there was a climax, but it wasn't very climactic (if that's even a word). Overall, I'm very disappointed in this movie. I only rated it a 2/10 because the one black friend was really funny."
221,"Favorite scene withDawn (Gabourey Sidibe) -
Critiquing the Gentleman who has an interest in her at the Restaurant.Elizabeth (Jena Malone) -
Chasing after Veronica/Eden on horseback, their fight and being dragged by rope and horse to her death.Julia (Kiersey Clemons) -
With Daniel. Thinking he's very sweet only for him to show her that he's not.Sarah (Lily Cowles) -
Her entire Outing with Veronica and Dawn.Veronica/Eden (Janelle Monae) -
Escaping using Yoga moves, a cell phone and a horse, getting a hold of her husband, setting the evil guys on fire, her fight with Elizabeth after being chased by her, dragging her by rope and horse to her death, and riding towards Freedom and Home."
222,"Things you should know:1. This movie will critique the hell out of the Confederacy, ""history"" lovers. If that offends you, this is not the movie for you. The Antebellum era was not glamorous. Black people were treated horribly. Deal with that fact or deny history.2. This movie is extremely unsettling, but not in the way you think. Without giving too much away, this movie relies on situational horror. In other words, it's not your Friday the 13th styled film.3. This movie will test your patience. And I believe the movie could've been condensed by 30 minutes or so.4. Some of the acting is a little, well, weird. The southern accents are just bad. I have a theory as to why, but I'll just leave that be.5. Again, the movie takes too long to put things together. It's a slow burn for no good reason at all.6. The twist is good. It's good because it doesn't come from nowhere. There are many hints to it in the beginning.7. The cinematography is really, really good.6/10. Could've been better. Honest opinion."
223,"I loved it up until the last 2 minutes. It almost became a movie you watch many times, but the last scene was so bad it ruined the whole movie for me."
224,"Skip the trailer, slow beginning. Worth every second.... POWERFUL"
225,"I had a very vague idea of what this movie was about, but it still ended up surprising me. I enjoyed it, especially the middle part that explained more of the characters, but the end had me on the edge of my seat. Although parts were challenging to watch, I don't feel like the story felt forced at all, and I appreciated being shown a different perspective than what I'm used to seeing. Yes, I guess you could call it preachy, but that doesn't have to be a bad thing. Don't listen to the bad reviews; watch it and decide for yourself."
226,"Good movie, just misinformed using Get Out and Us to get the viewers to watch this movie. Worth the $3.99 rented online. My rating would be 5.5 out of 10. A tad better than average."
227,"Agree with the general good idea/poorly executed reviews. Perhaps if some of the scenes were in a different order it would have made more sense but as it is, I was too distracted by what I consider errors in the telling of the story. Someone could recut/remake this into a better movie. It's a good first draft. Ending reminded me of Python's Holy Grail but unintentional."
228,"This is a horror movie. Can you image if this theme park really existed?!? OMG
I may have nightmares tonight from this movie. Will not watch this movie again."
229,I agree with the previous post Dylan. I figured it out close to end and really was a cliffhanger. The concept of the storyline had potential for growth. Maybe a sequel to tie up loose ends. I mean the violation. The audacity of it all frankly. I have no words and felt angry things like this really occurred.
230,"I watched this movie because they alluded to the fact that the producers also worked on Get Out and Us, giving the impression that it was going to have a bit of flair like those movies. I was wrong. I really wish they would have just promoted it based on the actual writers and directors, but then I guess people would have been more skeptical.It took me up to the Uber and phone scene to figure out that she had been kidnapped. The film just didn't make much sense up to that point.Was there a horror, yes, in the fact that these people were really-enacting aspects of history and kidnapping black men and women to be their ""slaves"" was despicable and horrific. The fact that these were educated, professionals that were made to be nothing more than ""cotton pickers"", who were demeaned, marginalized, beat, murdered and belittled was a bit more than I bargained for with this movie."
231,"2/10
The only good thing about this movie is Janelle Monae and the advertisement team who put up the great trailer"
232,"2.5 out of 5 stars.Antebellum is a horror thriller film that could have been so much more with its premise. Without giving away spoilers and the territory it crosses with the story. Which had a great twist that reveals itself in the second act. But falls flat with a direction that leaves this premise very empty with thrills and scares. Not sure if it would be in a horror category. More of a weak thriller.The plot is about Veronica (Janelle Monae) a successful writer/spokeperson with a loving family. Until she wakes up in the past. Captured and trying to survive living in a plantation. That is led by Jasper (Jack Huston). Enough said about the plot without crossing spoilers. The twist does not disappoint. Sadly, the direction does not do anything more with the premise besides leaving the script to being very hallow with its potential.The film starts out like a bleak drama as Veronica is in the plantation. Seeing other slaves being beaten. Assaulted and executed. While she familiarize herself in walking in her room without making any wooden floor noises which comes back to why she is doing that later. But when the film flashes back to the present time, learning more about her character. The drama and direction gets very flat with boring characterization and dialogue. The film tries to build some suspense but it fails to thrill. The second act is were it falls flat and is weak with its direction til it picks back up in the third act and climax after the twist is revealed.Janelle Monae delivered a great performance as Veronica. Jack Huston played a great villain. Jena Malone also delivered an eerie performance. Gabourey Sidibe stood out as an annoying character that delivered horrible dialogue.The film does get a little violent in the third act but it fails to thrill or even be scary with its concept. And some uneven direction that does not know what it is trying to be."
233,"This is a clever and interesting story. It doesn't become obvious until it has to do so, or just when you've had enough. I think it keeps your interest throughout and paced really well. I think this is what modern Horror/Reality/History telling should continue to evolve in movies. Janelle does a credible job as the lead, however, I don't think she had the acting skills ti carry the picture. Probably would have been better with a higher quality actor to really bring out the true irony of what is happening. There are some obvious editing flaws in a couple of plot areas that are never explained, but eliminated perhaps to cut length. I also believe that some characters should have been exoanded rather than focus on Janelle who still has under-developed acting chops. Overall, this is a good movie and worth seeing. No Oscar winners, but worthy of discussion with friends and family. I applaud Hollywood for ""stepping out of the box"" with this one."
234,"Not a horror film in that sense, but horror in the truest sense of the word, if you understand the parabolic meaning of the film in terms of racism and oppression for Black people, Indigenous people and People of Color in the USA and worldwide."
235,"I've seen nothing but lukewarm or negative reviews for Antebellum, so went in not expecting the best. But it turned out to be amazing. Scenes gave me physical chills, the cinematography was beautiful, the writing, the acting, everything was solid. I feel like the negative reviews stem from a mismanagement of marketing more than a lack of quality in the movie itself."
236,"I really wanted like this movie. It just fell short in so many areas. It seemed like it was rushed to be released in the current climate of our country in a desperate attempt to be part of the conversation. This movie was touched on the surface, obvious, horrors of slavery without ever diving deeper.This movie was a waste of time and less than 20 minutes into it I was bored. I made myself watch this movie because I paid for it. I want my 1h 45m back.I gave this movie 3 stars because I wouldn't even watch this movie to pass the time nor would I recommend it. It just wasn't good. All I got from the movie is slavery was cruel and bad...which I already knew."
237,More like drama/mystery and I had fun watching it. The middle 3rd had me scratching my head a little bit but everything came together in the end. The final 3rd twist was nicely executed. Good movie.7/10
238,"Antebellum is not what I thought it was going to be.
In my opinion it is no horror since I wasn't scared once. However it was a great and smart thriller that plays with chronology to establish the story and there giving it a big twist that makes the movie a hundred times better than the trailer shows.Some parts weren't as believable as others but the cinematography was outstanding and the acting was A+!Disclaimer: there's a lot of abuse in this movie which was really tough to watch, but I'm glad I did, cause it made me think, which I hope you will too after seeing this great movie that is nothing like its predecessors 'Get Out' and 'Us'."
239,"This Movie is beyond amazing!! It shows you how shocking and devastating slaves were treated and how it is a possibility something similar like the movie could be happening as we speak!! The movie is POWERFUL, EMPOWERING, HORRIFYING, BONE CHILLING, and most of all it's a reminder of what could be happening behind closed doors, and in the shadows away from the public!! It definitely is a time worthy movie in every sense of the word definitely begs for a rewatch just because of how the storyline transcends and eclipses to a phenomenal serve of justice/revenge done by the most amazing (Janelle Monáe)!! EXTREMELY RECOMMENDED TO WATCH AND FOR A SECOND REWATCH!! Loved the ending and the serve of justice/revenge at the end (best part in MY opinion)!! (PS: I can see why this movie most likely will not get the high rating reviews it truly deserves, because majority of WHITE Americans feel attacked or simply still have that conception that their ancestors had a century ago!! They feel like it puts them in a bad image,and frankly it should picture them in a bad way, and well if that's the only way to show the inhumane way WHITE people treat the BLACK race then so be it!!) Again truly a SPECTACULAR movie, a MASTERPIECE in every sense of the word!! 10/10!!"
240,"Yes, you'll be on the edge of your chair, especially at the wrap-up ending. This was excellent. It has a lot of metaphor and zero sub plot, so just understand this from the beginning. They could have added a sub plot or few and less metaphor but it would have made the film longer. While you're sitting there thinking how slow-moving it is in the beginning, you'll end up seeing how everything was wrapped up together so you'll want to see it twice to catch all the metaphor contained within. Watch and understand. Like with most of his work you'll be seeing it twice to catch all aspects of these strategically placed metaphors."
241,"What I thought it would be & how it played it out got me shook so screw the critics 🤚🏽.. watch it for yourself !! an amazing piece of work, a new cult classic"
242,The movie was good. A lot of the commenters giving low ratings need to get over themselves
243,This movie was bad. Spent too much time in the beginning. For the people who didn't understand the ending... what they dont understand is that the ending makes plenty of since it is the movie that is bad. That's why u were frustrated it's just the political hog wash at the end was uncalled for
244,"I was prepared for a lot but not this much !
I also undermined the capacity to create horror without actual bloody shots and disgusting things. As someone who does not watch horror at all, I can tell you that this completely surprised me. As I left the theater, it took me at least half an hour to form a comprehensive thought !Janelle Monaé portrays so well the pain of not only her own hell, but in extension that of her family."
245,"The story is good, script is so so. Directing is subpar overall. Nice cinematography.
My main issue is VERY bad acting by some and ok by others. Kiersey Clemons is one of the examples of absolutely atrocious acting and there are more.You also don't get a chance to build a rapport with anyone or get to like anyone, including the main character(s). I could care less about the woman and movie failed at that quite a bit.I think the director wrongfully put all the effort into showing how white people are bad instead of concentrating on character development.
This movie had a huge potential. With good acting I would've given it about 6.5 by the way.4.3/10"
246,"I don't see the reason for the critics to pan this title so heavily, comparing it to Get Out!, although the main idea is the same, they're total different flicks. Antebellum will keep you guessing until it tells you just how plaine simple it is, but still amazing. The acting is really wonderfull and the story is enigmatic and complex unitl it isn't. I simply loved it. Please watch it not as suspenseful or horror movie like The Exorcist, but as a modern thriller picture that has meaning."
247,"Had potential but ultimately fell flat. Story was somewhat original but didn't completely deliver. Some parts were so boring & drawn out that I wanted to fast fwd but the $20 I spent to watch it just wouldn't let me. Not a bad film, just not great either."
248,I was so hyped up for a nice horror movie after seeing the trailer but i was so disapointed with it. Far from horror movie
249,"It bother me when a movie has a good premise but poor execution. They had a solid, interesting storyline but just couldn't get it right."
250,"Damn a horrible and necessary movie. Why are the rates so low? The scene with the statue was so powerfull. To be fair, I was a bit surprised about the end. Felt like there was a bit more story to tell."
251,A great example of why Karma is my God. And all Black People demanding for is equality. Great film
252,"Good actors, cinematography and even direction. Well directed.NOT well written. This was 1.45 and could have been a 30 minute movie easily. Tons and tons of boring dialog in the middle. Even confusing, it could have been done better. This wasn't even a three act movie, more like a two act movie.The big ""do not tell your friends the ending!"" thing was such a let down. That's it? That's what I'm not supposed to tell my friends?On the plus side they did a good job with the plantation stuff as far as realistic and believable. Really makes you sad knowing that stuff really happened in our country. I wish the script was as good as their attention to details."
253,"I started this expecting a horror movie. This is a different type of horror altogether.It starts with a fantastic sweeping shot through a Southern plantation. We see slaves, Confederate soldiers and cotton fields. We see two slaves, a man and a woman, being restrained by soldiers. The man is taken down, the woman runs and is lassoed, dragged and shot.
It's clear within the first 20 minutes that our heroine - Eden/Veronica - is living on a brutal plantation. The depiction of outright cruelty and degradation isn't nice to watch, but being confronted with the truth about slavery isn't and shouldn't be comfortable. Talking is forbidden, escape attempts are punished with branding, beatings or death. The daily routine is harsh and the soldiers rape the slave women whenever they feel like it. Eden is raped regularly by a General known as 'Him'. She falls asleep after another rape.
When she awakes we see her in her upmarket apartment, with her husband and daughter. She is a successful writer. She flies off to a different city to give a talk to an eager audience.
Sound confusing? Well it is.As time progresses we start to see clues, we see familiar faces from the plantation in the city. Then there's a slow realisation what has actually happened.
It's a good film, I much prefer this to Us or Get Out. But there's no denying that it bears more than a passing resemblance to The Village.
The acting is outstanding, especially from the always excellent Janelle Monáe.
Some of the middle part of the movie slows the pace and could probably have been dumped and it still would have made sense.
I'm a fan of Gabourey Sidibe, but her character in this movie is awful. She's rude and condescending to an admirer, overbearing in her desire for attention, obnoxious and under the impression that she is irresistible to all who lay eyes on her. The fact that she gropes the Uber driver and thinks it's hilarious when he flinches is awful, a man doing the same to a woman would quite rightly be accused of sexual harassment, but as it's a woman doing wit we are expected to find it funny. I didn't.So don't believe the 1 and 2 star reviews, watch it for yourself and draw your own conclusions.
And the reviews stating the low ratings come from 'a certain section of society' or that you can't get the message unless your are 'marginalised' or a poc simply stand to inflame racial tension, not to help resolve it.
Grow tf up folks."
254,"The trailer made it look like a horror. Instead, it's just a boring, make you feel uncomfortable and confused for the first half film. The first 10 minutes and the last 10 minutes are great. The cinematography is beautiful. The acting is great from the leads. That's why the highest I can give is a 5. The plot is trash."
255,"Touted as a horror genre film; that it is not. Interesting, unique story but told in a non-interesting way. Think it was supposed to be a ""slow burn,"" but was just painfully slow and choppy. That (on top of the feeling that I was being preached to) made me give it a 4/10. Certainly not the worst movie I've watched, but bummed out I spent $20 on the rental on Amazon."
256,"Go back on your Disney+, and everyone who love psihological thriller movie's with the element's of eerie horror thus movie do not miss to watch!!!
Greatefull!!!"
257,Exquisite cinematography and breathtaking plot twists. A thrilling roller coaster ride that does not disappoint. Taut and sinister with a haunting score and a climax that will fill your heart!
258,"Janelle Monáe stars as Eden who at the start of the new film ""Antebellum"" is brought back to a Southern Plantation against her will by Union Soldiers. The consequences of her escape attempt are brutally taken out against two others as the rest of the plantation looks on in submissive silence.Weeks later more slaves arrive and are given the rules by the brutal Overseer who demands silence and utter obedience at all times.The slaves are made to work the fields and serve the plantation including the women being assigned to whichever soldier desires them.Their plight grabs you from the start in its brutality as they have no rights, live in fear daily, and are subject to whatever whims those in charge desire and they are required to obey and suffer in silence.One night after the General falls asleep after having his way with her; Eden awakens to a different reality. One set in the modern day where she is a wife, mother, and very successful author and activist. The film follows her life in the modern world before springing the twist which makes doing an in-depth review difficult without spoiling things. While I was able to predict the twist coming; it was still effective and chilling in how it was carried out.The film does get a bit lax in the final act as it relies on too many Hollywood clichés which while highly entertaining for me undermined the messages of the film and the situation.Gerard Bush and Christopher Rend both wrote and directed the film and there are some powerful and highly gripping moments to the film but it grabs you from the start and is compelling and deeply disturbing.The cast is very strong and the film is unforgettable. My biggest issue with the film was the final act as I alluded to prior. The film tries to tie things up a bit too neatly yet fails to adequately explain key aspects of the story. The audience is given some information and forced to fill in the gaps for themselves which in many ways makes the film even more disturbing.In the time of deep division in our country it is very upsetting to see how little has changed for many who do not see equality and justice applied equally and still live day to day with fear and uncertainty.""Antebellum"" is the rare film that entertains, informs, and makes you think and will remain with you after the movie ends."
259,"When I say this movie was great...I mean STUNNING. The message and twist behind this was incredible. This movie needs to go down in the industry as HISTORY. If you ask me, I feel like many people were ""disappointed"" because they expected a horror movie but horror or not, this psychology thriller needs to open the eyes of everyone!! Such great and powerful acting. Janelle's (Monae) acting career really has taken off right before our eyes, from hidden figures to Harriet, to so much more. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE."
260,I understand why its classified as a Horror... it was Nothing but Horrific Events that happened to my people and it is still happening today . I was not up to watching another slave movie but I got all of the messages in this film... Great film... Thank you
261,"I loved this movie,watched it twice. Janelle Monáe was astonishing and the plot twists kept me on the edge of my seat. The music was great. The way the scenes were shown was both haunting and beautiful. Janelle's journey takes you from the depths of despair to the pinnacle of triumph"
262,"If you like Twilight Zone or Handmaids Tale or American Horror Story, you will love this movie. Plot line with a twist and a very satisfying ending. Wished I could have seen it on the big screen."
263,SPOILER ALERT: I loved it! It was really weird in the beginning I couldn't decide if it was based in the present or past just to find out that it mixes both in. The scary part about this is that everyone knows that there are a lot of injustices going on in the world today and it stems from racism and for the movie's main quote to be the past never moves on.... 😳 I don't think I like the idea of people not wanting to let go of racism etc anyways I did enjoy the movie I couldn't figure out how they could mix the past and the present together and come to find out she was being held captive at a reenactment park in the present where she was a slave on the plantation mixing the two together the sad thing is is that people where actually dying there I'm glad she escaped and got away
264,This is a great movie with a twist I wasn't expecting.
265,"I wonder what movie did the critics watch. This movie was intense and really scary because, not only this could happen but also there is a lot of garbage-people in the US who would gladly partake. This movie was amazing in every way!"
266,"At one point in the middle of the movie I was lost. I didn't know when the horror will begin. But when the plot twist was revealed my heart sank, and I felt horrifically enraged. I don't have much to say about this movie, you have to watch it yourself. I did, however, enjoy the scene where the ""gentlemen"" are locked inside the ""steam Room"". I also enjoyed the scene where the fair lady of the plantation comes to a complete and sudden stop near the end of the movie. The horror I felt in this movie was unprecedented to me. It's that kind of horror you feel can be extremely plausible in this day and age. After the movie ended I felt upset there was not enough displays of fine finishes of the antagonists.
I know why ""some people"" hated this movie. They have every right to that."
267,"I don't quite understand the terrible reviews this film has gotten. It's not quite the masterpiece of 'Us' or 'Get out' and the time warp could have done with a lot more clarity, but as of the time of writing this it has a 5.5 review which is ridiculously low. I can't help thinking it's been downvoted because of political reasons. Now, back to the time warp... if David Lynch can flip and divert an entire films narrative just 'because' and create an abstractive piece of cinema, then why can't this film? If Quentin Taranto can make film finales fuelled on justice and revenge then why can't this film? Perhaps it's simply because the setting is on a slave plantation which makes folk uncomfortable? Either way I thoroughly enjoyed it, right to the ending, which I found incredible visually powerful."
268,"""The Village"" meets ""12 years a slave"". Worth it to see Janelle's performance alone. She absolutely deserves a nomination!"
269,"This review does not contain any spoilers and my suggestion is just watch it and enjoy...This was a good movie. I didn't read the description of the movie so I thought this was some type of past vs present day horror but it was much better than that. First, although the concept is horrifying, it's not a horror but more of a suspense. Second, the cinematography is amazing. Third, the concept is very timely considering the climate in our country.It's also something that me and my black friends discuss all the time...this thought of how some white people are living in the past and we're living in the present with an eye on the future. This movie is what I envision white folks thinking when they shout MAGA.Finally, my funny takeaway after watching Antebellum...I'm switching my phone service to Verizon. I'll be damn if my freedom depends on Sprint!! 😩😩"
270,Enjoyed everything about the movie from beginning to end.
271,"People are hating on this movie probably because the ads showed it was a horror movie but it is actually not. But I personally loved it. It has an original beautiful idea. It also has nice twists and messages that I wont talk about in order not to spoil it, and it tackles nice and important topics. Moreover, the camerawork and sceneries are beautiful. The performance by the lead is great as well. Give this nice film a chance."
272,"Initially I thought the film didn't make sense at all. When it finally did, I was completely blown away by how clever it is. This is a captivating and very effective film."
273,"For me one of the more polarizing films that I have seen. I have seen quite a few films and the thought that Janelle Monae felt strongly enough to take the lead on this movie and that the film needed to be made in the first place says so much about the inequalities, prejudice and hatred that continues to exist in society, especially America. We see this all around us, in the news and social media. I think some have become immune to its impact this is why for many it continues to perpetuate through generations and is such a challenge to eradicate. I don't want to give spoilers if you have not seen this movie but I thought it was an extremely imaginative and original film that did well emphasizing a specific message and making a strong point."
274,"Those that rated this so low do not appreciate the eloquent blend of history and the climate of the world today. Truly a psychological thriller that will mess with your mind but worth the watch. This would be Trumps America in 2020 if he had his way. Thank God we have a better future ahead of us. If you rated this is low, I bet it made you uncomfortable because this is the history you celebrate. Beautifully directed, and should be appreciated for the art that it is."
275,"I can only conclude to the bad ratings because it has the lead character being a strong, educated, inspirational & beautiful black woman, not a white woman. She, as well as everyone else, does a great job acting and the visuals are also done extremely well. The twist was not hard to figure out, and I'm not quite sure why is labeled a horror movie, rather a psychological thriller. Other than that, the movie was great, and was well worth watching. I normally would rate it an 8, because it's not a horror & have a certain rating scale of movies. However, I rated this a 10 because of the low ratings, because like I said, if a white woman was in the leading role, it wasn't categorized as a horror, I am positive that there would be much higher ratings and better reviews. I even read in one review, the white woman, Jenna Malone, should receive an oscar? I'm sorry, what? Yeah, she's a good actress, I don't take that away from her, but um.......no. Maybe they meant the lead actress, because Jenalle Monae' and Jenna Malone sound alike, and they got it backwards, if so, my mistake, but if not well, like I said..... The movie was very good but not a horror movie, it's definitely a psychological thriller. I recommend watching it, no matter which it is. Yes, there is a message being sent within this movie, but that's the case in many movies. It's not as one reviewer said, ""Black is power, White is bad."" __eye roll___ If you're racist in any manner, you shouldn't watch it, because your not gonna like anything that shows any black person in it unless they are slaves or killed, smh.....Otherwise, if you are not racist and like thrillers, you will like this movie. You'd probably like it either way, whether you like thrillers or not, so maybe try it out......"
276,"The music was excellent, lots of interesting symbolism, great cinematography...the long opening shot was both terrifying and beautifully done. I was expecting a decent Popcorn Horror movie but I got more than I bargained for. Good job!"
277,Just don't... period! This movie just has well nothing. Just terrible
278,"I don't understand the negative reviews for his movie... but I can take a wild guess and say that most of the negative reviews are most likely people who don't think racism exists. The twist to this movie was good. The trailer was misleading and I didn't really know what I was about to watch but I'm very glad I went in clueless. The acting was great, the story line was original and it was truly an eye opening movie.Funny that most of the negative reviews don't really specify why the movie was worth a one star rating other than ""it was a horrible movie."" Don't listen to them. If you care about the history of black people and what they have suffered through and continue to go through, definitely watch this movie. It's believable and highlights a huge issue in our society."
279,"5.5 on IMDB? This needs to be up there in the high 8. I came across this movie by mistake. The first 4 minutes 58 seconds did it for me from a cinematographers point of view. It was one shot for nearly 5 minutes, even over a hedge? It was smooth. Then we had a multitude of powerful cuts, each image a thousand words.This movie was beautifully shot, beautifully thought out and beautifully delivered. Admittedly, It was hard to follow toward the middle, but upon conclusion, everything made sense. It is full of twists, it's a trip. But wow. Well worth it.Outstanding!!!"
280,"Pre-pandemic, I remember seeing trailers for this in the theater and thought it looked intriguing. Couldn't really decipher what the film was going to be about based on it. I'm glad it was released digitally, more studios should just be doing that at this point. Anyways, I had the opportunity to check it out and while I do admire the concept I didn't think the film leaves the impression that it wanted to. However, I will see the lead performance from Janelle Monae is jut great and I'd love to see her more in film.
The film is going to be really hard to describe without giving away key plot points so I'll keep it minimum. Lets just describe it as a young slave who experiences truly horrible atrocities on a plantation and tries to devise ways to escape her situation. Though his character is pretty despicable in this, I'm glad to see Jack Huston get work as he was probably my favorite part of Boardwalk Empire.
As mentioned earlier the film fails to live up to the potential it creates. Midway, through you are truly intrigued with what is going on and even the twist at the end is pretty good. I'm not bothered by shocking twists and reveals if its done well and serves the plot well. I feel like there needed to be more substance in this film to really warrant its existence. It does well to build up its atmosphere and show how brutal Plantation's were and the treatment slaves receive but it doesn't act well on its premise.The middle section feels out of place and while its supposed to feel that way I suppose, it doesn't really connect the passages and definitely could have been written better. It also drags and all around adds to the unevenness of a film that could have made a real point but doesn't. Still, Janelle Monae is really good in this and really increases how watchable it is. She needs to get more work because she has knocked it out of the park in every role shes done. Overall, this will divide and polarize. There are enjoyable aspects but it feels so flawed because you know how good it could have been.6/10"
281,"The movie wasn't HORRIBLE, it was twisting and shocking. It makes you think which is what a good movie should do. Not a horror movie though like advertised, more sick than scary."
282,"Honestly, I have to give this a 10 because I see alot of negatives here claiming race baiting. Ridiculous! If this triggers you, then you should check yourself deeply.That said, its not horror as I expected, and that should be the ONLY negative that is legit. I see people saying the first 20 minutes was great, oh you mean the first 20 minutes where black people were treated like utter trash? WOW.Just needed to rate cause the negatives are ridiculous."
283,Antebellum was very original and had a great ending. Acting was very good. A little too slow at times though.
284,"If you watched the trailer for Antebellum, like Garrett and I did before going into it, then it's more than likely that you speculated about what the 'twist' of the film is, so to speak. Garrett and I had two wildly different theories (involving a simulation and time travel, respectively), both of which were laughably incorrect; we attribute this to the somewhat misleading trailer. Speaking of which, the trailer depicts two distinct settings: the modern day and the Antebellum period. The dialogue also slips in a line clearly meant to throw the viewer off from guessing the twist, and it succeeded in doing so--to the point where Garrett and I were questioning which setting was real and which wasn't. It isn't until roughly the midway point when the pieces starting falling in place and the twist was revealed, leaving both Garrett and me satisfied. The casting as well as the acting were top-notch, and I was especially impressed with Janelle Monáe's performance. The soundtrack is elegant, and, when paired with the cinematography, makes Antebellum aesthetically pleasing from start to finish. The film has been heavily criticized for its portrayal of racism, but it serves to indicate--albeit extremely--how racism is still a prevailing issue in society today. An original concept for a film that kept us on the edge of our seats with surprisingly tense moments and well-written characters. A must-watch of 2020."
285,"This movie will provoke thoughts and definitely make you aware if you are already are not that RACISM IN AMERICA STILL OCCURS! The lead actress was for sure EMPOWERING and portrayed the very essence of a STRONG AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN who refused to give up despite the adversity and obstacles put in front of her.Most will watch this movie for face value, but its definitely NOT THAT TYPE OF MOVIE! As time passes, we often forget about the past as it is not what WE ARE CURRENTLY experiencing however this movie is a GREAT REMINDER that we should NOT forget, and we should use the motivation of our ancestors to persevere and continue to strive for EQUALITY as it is our RIGHTS as (1) Humans and as (2) Americans.Let this movie not fuel hatred, but to spark consciousness and to open your minds eye. Let this movie further make you aware that this country is currently being lead by an individual who incites hatred and racial inequality. Let this movie allow you to question WHEN WAS AMERICA EVER GREAT? since someone opts to say to ""make it great AGAIN."".Bravo to the cast and staff who put this movie together!!! And for those who see this review, receive the actual message the movie is conveying. As one of the confederate generals in the movie states ""we are nowhere and everywhere"" ... Let that resonate in your mind for a bit as we are STILL experiencing SOCIAL INJUSTICE just as those did centuries ago."
286,Not a big fan of this movie is very confusing. Did not like the end.
287,"This is coming from someone who didn't see anything prior to this to compare it to. I'm pretty picky on movies. Someone said it's not horror? Even tho I'm not Black, I would assume it is horror to them, c'mon put yourself in her shoes. As for the story, I loved it. I began to think I was watching another ROOTS movie. Then all the sudden we are in present time. With weird stuff happening. Then back into the past, but with cell phones. And then it all started to come together and make sense to me.
It's a thriller. I believe it had a great story. I couldn't easily spot stupid errors that were overlooked. You know, like tires squealing on dirt roads, 4 stroke motorcycles sounding like 2 strokes. No 6 shooters shooting 10 shots. When being shot at, hearing the bang BEFORE you hear the bullet whizz past you (no one ever gets that right, apparently they never been shot at) Not that this movie had motorcycles or other thing listed above, just an example of common mistakes that degrade a movie. that says to me that they slapped it together and pushed it out the door, didn't bother to watch it themselves. Like proof read. (Proof watch) But not this movie. I didn't see obvious mistakes.
This was entertaining. Raised my pulse and made me feel like I was there. That's all I want from a movie.Do not group or link this to Black Lives matter or White Lives matter, too. C'mon, ALL lives matter. Just watch the darn movie and enjoy it, leave politics out."
288,"Great cast, wonderful picture, so many details! Love every piece! Go for it!"
289,"I'll need to watch it again. As a former film reviewer/critic for Indiewire's Shadow and Act... I will say that I've screened films that were flat story wise. This wasn't one of those types of films. I felt so many energies with the storytelling... so I'm excited to watch it again.I really loved the cinematography. I loved the lead actresses performance.I noticed that before watching the film one need to be up to date with race relations. The filmmakers do make the assumption that all watching are versed! Lol. But I'll take that. I'll research the south a bit more and rewatch.
However, somehow, that should've been inbeded into the story.Anyways, I give it a 10. Because I'm watching it again. I feel kind of excited about it."
290,"The movie was great. Janelle Monae was great! Disregard the negative reviews as they are by design. Some will never accept the truth and will continue to rewrite history as well as the present with their alternative facts.Movies that are about slavery, Americas Holocaust, are no different than the movies about the Nazi's and the Jewish Holocaust. Hopefully one day we will welcome these types of movies the same way we continue to welcome and produce movies on the Jewish Holocaust. Stop with the double standards. Cheers."
291,"This movie is timely based on today's current political, racial and social environment. Some reviewers are carping on the fact it is not a true HORROR movie. Listen up, for Black Americans it's the horror we live with daily. The fact that we can be harassed, brutalized, or worse, murdered for driving, barbecuing in a park, jogging, bird watching, eating ice cream or sleeping in our own damn homes- you name it, simply for the color of our skin. We live with the fear that our hard won freedoms can be snatched from us any day. Some angry whites counter the movie is stereotypical and presents them in a bad light. Guess what? History has presented Blacks in a bad light for years! I'm sure this portrayal is closer to fact than the inhumane images Blacks have had to deal with for generations. If you like movies that are timely, well acted, will make you think, and have plot twists, this movie's for you."
292,"This movie reminds us of our past in the U.S, but puts a unique twist on the story. Definitely is worth the watch."
293,"I think we need to focus on the fact that this is a good movie. We need to learn that what goes on in this movie might be going on in the real world. This movie is very educational me as a 15-year old I wonder and I know this is going on. Slavery might be going on discreetly in the U.S. and kids and women are getting Sex Trafficked for no reason. Mainly black women and kids because some people might not agree to peace and the 13th Amendment. I think young kids should learn from this. The history that our teachers give us in a class all of the White individuals get recognized except for most of the black people. We need to be heard too, we need to be freed much more, we need to be equal and no violence. We shouldn't be judged by the color of our skin. We shouldn't be getting killed by police because of our skin color. Many black people should stand up for what's right. Were shouldn't get judged for the color of our skin because we are much more were human beings and as a Black teenager, I know we should. I think nowadays we should teach young black children about what's going on, THE TRUTH. People shouldn't give a thumbs down, they should focus on the concept and the main idea of the movie."
294,This is not your average horror and to say it took me by surprise is an understatement.Stick with it. Immerse yourself in it. You will not be disappointed.It's shot beautifully with a powerful soundtrack that stuck with me and Janelle Monáe delivers an outstanding performance.Completely gripping.Please don't listen to the low scores. God knows what they were thinking when they watched it.
295,"Yeah I'm white and I loved it. These bad reviews have to be fake. Good story, plot, costumes, hair/make up and acting!!!!!!! Try and pick up on some symbolism and learn something!"
296,"If you didn't know anything about the movie prior watching it like me (no trailers watched or sinopsis read) you are going to start watching this movie and you are not going to understand what the hell is going on. Trust me, keep watching and in the third act you are going to say OMG. It's a really great plot twist. It's difficult to stay watching till you understand the story but for me is worth it. Just try to pay attention to every small detail and the twist is going to hit you hard like it did to me.
It's really beautifully filmed and has some awesome shots, but the performances has it ups and downs. Sometimes they are really good but others are over the top. This last happens especially in the second act where the most boring and really poor written and acted scenes take place. Not even Janelle Monáe that carries the whole story on her back can escape the lame second act.
Some may say it's a story that falls into common african american culture topics. To be honest, they are right. But trust me, I don't recall a story that uses them to tell this type of tale, and it's a really great tale.
A must watch if you like modern horror/thriller films."
297,"I don't understand all the terrible reviews here. This was an amazing movie! Politically charged, great performances and beautiful cinematography. I loved the plot and twists and all the details that (especially all the haters) probably missed.
Yes, I agree that this is not a horror movie. One could argue that it shows the horrors of slavory but following that logic, you'd have to list '12 years a slave' or 'Schindler's List' as horror movies too. It's a dark, intense drama.
And to everyone who's whining about the trailer being misleading, well so was the one for Get Out so you should've expected as much.
Definitely worth seeing - and pay attention to the many details!"
298,The horror is in the truth. The realities of oppression both past and present. Settings may have changed but the realities remain. Watch with an honest heart and embrace the artistry of the performances. Tears shed are real. Amazing movie.
299,I don't get the low score. My other half put this on with no expectations. The story line changed without warning. I thought I was watching a story from a time beyond then told through the grandchild in our modern world. No grandchild! She was the story. I was glued from start to end. Exactly what you want from a film
300,It was interesting to watch there was a couple times were I was confused and wondering what was going on but i understood once i got to the end of the movie. We all know Jordan Peele does some weird movies.. Us was definitely a weird one for me so i went in watching it knowing it was going to be a little off but i actually ended up liking it. We really never know what is going on in this world we live in this could be happening somewhere in the Deep South for real. I like how he incorporated 2020 with the 1800 that was a good twist. Just try to watch it with a open mind
301,"Well truth be told, and it needs to be told..the civil war was nothing to be looked upon with fond memories and glory. It was a horrific time in our history. No this isnt a horror movie in the classic sense, but it is horror. History can be more horrifying than any movie. I found Antebellum made me uncomfortable to watch it, much like the pilot of Lovecraft country did not because it was gory. But because it made me realize how absolutely horrible and awful it was back then. The movie is about the evil that upright citizens are capable of against their fellow citizens, against the backdrop of the south shall rise again! Naw sorry but it wont, and thank god for that."
302,This tackles all the issues of now. Wasnt what I was expecting but the trailer was so weird too. Very good acting all around. But in the end it was The Village with issues of now - not that is a bad thing.
303,"The only reason this movie has bad reviews is because of the trump cult, who disliked seeing their rasict ancestors portrayed as the evil people they were. Excellent movie with a mind blowing twist at the end!"
304,Horrifying film shot so beautifully it hurts. Oscar worthy performances. This film is important.
305,"Evening out the negative reviews. I was so uncomfortable watching Antebellum that I was glued to my chair for most of it. Also, the music and the acting (Janelle Monae!!) is incredible. I do agree that the actual story isn't that long and could maybe use more 'body'. Nevertheless, good movie."
306,"This is my very 1st review, so I hope my input comes out the way I want it. I believe this movie had a good written script but the execution failed poorly. It could've have been SO MUCH more and plus the way they advertised the movie was misleading, you're expecting a horror/thriller/paranormal type and what you got was a story to which you really didn't know what was happening til the middle of the movie. Acting was superb but there was so many random events there were never seen all the way through. Several loose ends. It almost feels like they were shooting the film, stopped 3/4ths of the way through and worked with what they had lol. Was it the pandemic that slowed the production, I don't know but I just expected something better. 5/10"
307,If you don't think this is horror you're probably white
308,Nothing worthwhile to see here. Spend your time elsewhere.
309,"This movie is absolutely horrible. It's empty, it serves no purpose and also, how is it even considered horror? Just because there's a creepy girl in the movie doesn't make your movie a 'horror'. What is happening to this genre?"
310,"The movie has two timelines and consists of three parts: past, present and the solution. Past is thrilling and well done, present is quite boring actually and seems a bit too long; and the timelines solution, I didn't expect THAT, so well done too.
Liked the theme music, don't forgot the sounds."
311,I absolutely love this movie!!!!This movie made me and my friends stick around to have a deep conversation about this movie from start to finish. This movie is a conversation starter on this perplex place known as the United States and its history.
312,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Some media outlets are providing a spoiler-ish synopsis that I believe the film should have omitted throughout its marketing campaign, including its own trailers. There's a central mystery that only begins almost midway through the runtime, and it plays out until the start of the third act, so you have my advice: stay away from its trailers and don't read too many synopses. Since I didn't know anything about it, I watched Antebellum with modest expectations, and most important of all, without any preconceived ideas or theories about its narrative structure.However, I couldn't help but see the movie later than most people, and I have to admit: I'm slightly surprised that so many people deeply hate this film... It does have some issues, and I'll get to those, but overall, I believe the extreme White-on-Black violence is the main reason why so many viewers gave up on the movie. I'll start with this topic. It's indisputable that Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz (feature directorial debuts) deliver quite a shocking film, depicting racism and slavery in unpleasant yet realistic ways. This last part is precisely the seamless balance that every movie needs to have when dealing with these themes, and in my opinion, Bush and Renz didn't really nail it.The brutal torture and death sequences that Black people suffer in this film are shown without any restraint. From massive amounts of blood to visible hits, it's one of those movies that carries so much realism that it becomes uncomfortable. If these scenes end up carrying a meaningful message or a compelling arc, it might be hard to watch, but it ultimately feels necessary and emotionally impactful. If they don't, then it just looks like violence for the sake of entertainment, which will always bother a lot of viewers depending on the type of violence on display. Bush and Renz risk the film's success walking this thin line, and overall, even though they're far from perfecting that balance, they didn't do a bad job, at all.In fact, for a directorial debut, Antebellum is technically remarkable. Opening with an uncut, long opening sequence, where the camera shows the entire plantation, passing through the recent arrival of Janelle Monáe's character, and finishing in a horrendous slow-motion treatment of a desperate slave trying to escape. These six to eight minutes function like a disclaimer to the audience. If people feel way too disturbed by what they've just witnessed, then it's better to leave this one on the side, and forget about it.Pedro Luque's cinematography feels definitely unique, and it never shies away from displaying what's happening, no matter how gruesome and terrible. The musical score from Nate Wonder and Roman Gianarthur, characterized by its dominant use of strings, elevates so many suspenseful moments. Honestly, it's pretty addictive to listen to. Great production value, as expected, costume and set design are fantastic... visually, I find nothing to complain about. Even judging the brutality solely on itself, if the purpose is to demonstrate how much slaves suffered back then, it's as faithful as it could be.Story-wise, Bush and Renz need to improve their quality as screenwriters. Their premise is extremely convincing, the nonlinear narrative structure adds a neat mystery, and the story itself is incredibly intriguing. However, instead of reaching its undeniable potential and delivering a phenomenal, profound, well-developed screenplay, Antebellum ends up in a predictable manner, leaving tons of interesting storylines to explore. Even its climactic, action-heavy final minutes are underwhelming, and every problem is solved way too easily. It even gives the viewer the right to question why and how everything that happens in the movie could, in fact, occur for so long.Nevertheless, it's far from being a trainwreck, much on the contrary. I was invested until the very end, almost every scene is captivating to the point of me staying completely still without taking my eyes off the screen. I didn't feel too uncomfortable with the display of violence, so my experience was smoother than most people, I'd assume. The excellent representation of Janelle Monáe's character's distinct lifestyles, in the plantation and in the city, is the best aspect of the entire film, clearly setting up a different color palette and tone. Monáe offers a powerful performance, carrying the whole movie on her shoulders, as the sole protagonist of an incredibly heavy story.All in all, Antebellum is set to divide viewers due to its uncomfortable yet realistic, extreme violence. Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz deliver an undeniably shocking film, involving hard-to-watch depictions of torture, slavery, and racism. Technically, the camera work gives the whole movie a distinct style, as well as its score, costumes, and set design. Janelle Monáe demonstrates her acting abilities as the protagonist, delivering an emotionally captivating display. The nonlinear narrative structure elevates the central mystery, but the story doesn't receive the extensive treatment that its premise deserves. The enormous potential is wasted in meaningless, horrific deaths, just as in the third act's disappointing action sequences. While the White-on-Black violence is justified in the context of the film, its excessive, unrestrained display without a convincing message or arc surrounding it is definitely a negative aspect that some people won't be able to accept. I didn't feel bothered to that level, and I still believe the intent was benign, so I recommend this directorial debut from Bush and Renz, but with a disclaimer for the sensitive subject matter and/or viewers who struggle with depictions of intense violence.Rating: B"
313,"I didn't see the trailer for this movie, knew nothing about it and am not very find of Janelle Monae. She always plays the same character with the same facial expression in everything.
But...oit of boredom.. I watched it.. . The first segment was mildly irritating but I wasn't expecting the 2nd one and that caught my attention. A number of possibilities ran through my head and they seemed to be confirmed with script.
The 3rd segment really caught me.. I didn't see it coming at all.
I've watched the movie twice. The first segment, is now much more interesting, seeing these people for who they are.
Forget trailers, they're usually misleading, forget the reviews, people take things too personally.
Its a good movie, it's original, which is exactly what's missing nowadays."
314,"I thought this was going to be a scary/thriller but it was more of a good suspenseful movie. The low ratings are probably coming from the same type of ppl who don't want to face racism in this country or believe that white priviledge even exists. Without giving away any spoilers, the movie was good. It's like ""Get Out"" meets ""The Village."""
315,"Ignore the poor reviews and watch this clever movie unfold before your eyes. I really enjoyed this - from the shocking title sequence panning shot, through the WTF moments that mess with your head to the big reveal ending. The movie was well paced, photographed, acted and written. Yes, it was a bold statement piece with plot similarities to a certain M Night Shyalaman film, but those points aside - cracking entertainment that was at times uncomfortable and unforgettable. Moving and shocking in equal measure. 8/10"
316,"Similar to Get out but in a different twist.
Great performance can watch once."
317,"I really don't understand all the negative reviews and I wonder if some part of it is due to the fact that this movie (especially the first half) is uncomfortable to watch. Yes this film is political more so than it is horror. The messages of the film are not subtle So if you don't like this kind of film, Antebellum is not for you.
I was hooked by the story and at any given moment wanted to know how the story continues. Additionally, I liked that the twist was not what I thought it was based on the trailers.
I think the film takes a lot of inspiration from get out, as well as from Django. Is it as good as these two movies? No. Is it worth a watch? Sure!"
318,"The weekend is upon us again and we once more get to see how the former art of movies has further tumbled down the mediocre realm with COVID effects. Tonight's review is a movie that looked to be the next twisted horror that would have everyone talking. With an odd advertising campaign, some delays, and now an at home review, does this film have what it takes to defy expectations and be a masterpiece? I'm taking another dive into the movie trenches in hopes of giving you some good opinions to assess if you should check this movie out or if you should skip it, as I review:Movie: Antebellum (2020)Directors:

Character usage is cheap and underdeveloped at Times
The ending is somewhat fulfilling, but not suspenseful
More Vicious Than Engaging At times
The Focus On The Political Aspect Than The Story
Not Really ScarySummary:A strong thriller like this where political idealism seems to be key is going to require a strong acting cast to lift the crew. Well... Monae accomplishes this and does so much of the lifting that the rest of the cast is almost absent. Without revealing any details, Monae's character spans this odd tail and requires her to play across the range of character traits from the oppressed slave trying to keep things together despite being tortured, to the strong headfast modern woman that is the hot trend. She does each role with poise, professionalism, and fervor that I was able to murk through the swamp of this movie by just focusing on her talent alone. The other characters do their part, for the little time they have, but they work to add some comedy, love, and attachment, though oddly placed, that our character needs.
Moving on the setting of the movie is interesting at times serving the theme of the movie and sometimes providing the necessary visual chemistry to get your spine tingling, Primarily the hallways of the hotel and the dark bliss of the night, Antebellum's setting adds some realistic fervor that is the true haunting part, but serves more so for the other them of this message as a political thriller. The music further helps add its own emotional fervor to the film be it creepy ambience to hint at something happening, aggressive tracks to represent the mood of the film, to even the inspiring orchestral piece designed to inspire and send you into battle. The audio and visual are certainly the gimmicks that will help set the mood and help try to drown out the limitations of the film, which with Monae as the center star are pretty much the main positives for this reviewer. In terms of originality, it at least took a different manor of presenting a limited used concept, which artistic goers will love to watch unfold, while casual goers may find a bit convoluted and forced.However, this reviewer found more dislikes than likes for this film given the direction the trailers led me to believe would be the source. It starts with the pacing and the fact that the film is super slow and dragged out for a horror movie. Timing the film as I did, I found that the aspects I was looking for did not hit until around 45-50 minutes, with the first part being an elaborate set up for the potential twist. It's not so thrilling, and with my expectations, I believe that was the part that dragged the movie out. Despite the slow pace, the movie's plot unfortunately was not layered, developed, or entertaining for me and when looking at the frame of the movie was disappointing. Part of this had to do with the artistic presentation to be original, but for me it was the character usage that took away from the plot the most. So many promising characters she engaged with were limited in names, back story, and even emotional depth for me that they were almost negligible. Sure, each character presented something of the lead's life, but only fell into the background to try and keep track on what I think the film's real focus. Even the antagonists held little names, threat, and development, reduced to a realistic farce of what the usual antagonists of films like these are, but this forced background information, though late, was nice to see to help close the tale. Regardless, this limited tale you might hope has a fulfilling ending and in a way it does, but again depends on what you expect going into the film. On one side, you will feel some great justice, pride, and vindication for how the film ends, the messages, closure, and symbolism/representation so high you'll be beaming with pride. Yet, if you go in expecting that suspenseful, on the edge of your seat finale where characters are pushed to the brink, then lower the expectations because it is not that thrilling, engaging, or exciting for this reviewer. Simplistic sneaking around, some very lackluster and off balanced fighting, and monologues that do little to scare and build suspense are what await the eager horror person at this point.
In terms of the scary element of the film, you can guess that I was not chilled, disturbed, or creeped out by the ""horror"" element, outside of the realism this film held. The scary elements were more vicious bouts of violence, where the uncomfortable abuse factors are hard to watch at points, alongside some of the consequences that result. As I've said/hinted, the film really dilutes the horror element by instead choosing to go down the political drama avenue that I knew would be integrated, but not this prominent. Antebellum's writing, character usage, visualization, and twists are all on track for the current political hot trend track that social media seems to eat up these days. The writing in particular is a bit too in your face for me, going overboard to push the agenda and in doing so drop the mystery, horror, and much of the thriller aspect for me. While I agree the message is important, I'm not a fan of the modern trend of message over storytelling, so I can't say that that aspect alone is deserving of a high grade.The VERDICT:Let's wrap this up. Antebellum is definitely a disguised movie that teases horror, intrigue and mystery, but turns out to be more of a strong suited political drama with little else embedded in its backbone. The majorly talented Monae executes her role fantastically, hitting so many designs and directions that I could not help but be impressed with her skills as an actress. While the original presentation, visual elements, and sound editing are also strong aspects of the film, they don't help the pacing of the movie, barely establish the horror elements, and do nothing to improve the limited character/developed story of this film. As such, unless you need a new approach to the political movements of the day, this film is best left to cheaper renting later on down the line, and filling your day with HBO Max series like Lovecraft country instead.My scores for this film are:Horror/mystery/Thriller: 6.0
Movie Overall: 4.5"
319,"I am a big fan of movies that deal with the subject of slaves breaking free and escaping their captivity. Even as a white male, I just find films like that to be very inspiring and often quite intense to watch. I really enjoyed Emperor, 12 Years a Slave, and Harriet among other movies of that nature, and if you enjoyed them as well, this is likely going to be right down your alley. Without giving away any spoilers, this one has a rather large twist on the whole thing. There is a certain point in this movie that you might begin to recognize it as a horror film, but entirely in a psychological sense. I truly enjoyed it and definitely don't see why some people thought so poorly of it. The acting was great. The story was well done and suspenseful. A lot of the reviews here say that the movie was not well executed and needed to have a bit more of a background, but I thought it was just fine. It may have been a bit cooler if they would have gone into more depth with some of the characters or something, but it wasn't in desperate need of it as some reviews would have you assuming. Definitely worth a watch, though!"
320,"A delicate subject, indeed. But an honest review is made from a neutral stand, focusing on the plot itself, photography, soundtrack, acting and innovation.
Antebellum casts a continuous veil of uncertainty and plants doubts on what we think is past or future.
Great soundtrack, great acting and suspenseful mood.
Give it a try, you'll be surprised."
321,The story is really gripping! The lead actress is brilliant I'm a fan!
322,"As an asian who stay in multiracial country, Malaysia, I think I can review the movie impartially as black or white to me is the same.The story structure of the movie is rigid, which comprises three different part. The black slavery in plantation, the origin of the protagonist, and how she fight and escape. The story come out in a justifiable way, step by step reveal the whole story behind, which also make every twist become mind-blwoing. It did surprised me.And I do appreciate every scene in movie, visually breathtaking. Even under such a bright tune, with beautiful vintage vibe, you can still feel the tense, fear and hopeless which the character express, of course the acting is satisfy too. The camera move is superb, make the movie to another level. The soundtrack or bgm, even the way they dress is just impeccable.Antebellum is one of the top 10 in 2020 to me. Don't take everything too serious, try to tolerate the loop hole, it still consider a above average movie."
323,"Don't really get the review. It was a very good movie actually ! Somehow in between handmaid's tale and the village. Yeah maybe predictable but with some good ideas. I love the ""green"" saturation image all along and especially when we approch the kidnapping, same visual atmosphere is coming back slowly, I thought it was great"
324,The trailers are better than the movie. Watch them and save yourself the time
325,The description and trailer are misleading. I liked the idea and if done differently it could have worked well. Thriller but not horror.Despite not being what I was expected I like the idea behind it but it was poorly done. They could have dragged a bit more the doubts regarding if what was really happening I think it would have made the movie better.As I said I get the idea but if you think about it for more than a second there are a lot of plot holes.Good effort but disappointing.
326,"The Film Was Great Because The Subject Matter Might Be A Bit Off Putting To People It Did Not Deserve To Be Marked Down Because Of That - There Are To
Many Woke People In The World To Fully Understand Its History Content"
327,"Sure the trailer is misleading it's more of a drama/thriller with a few horror elements so if you want a full on horror this isn't it. Jonelle Monáe is magnificent throughout really gives an extraordinary performance! The bulk of the movie is about trying to escape a slavery colony with some mysterious aspects mixed in there.The cinematography is absolutely incredible, would've been nice to see in the theater but at home on Halloween with a 4K TV was good enough and watched with my sister Emily along with our dog Lucas that was all delightful! Quite satisfied with Antebellum the way it plays out and I'd recommend it to anyone that might appreciates the film for what it is!"
328,Anyone who says that they liked the originality of this movie obviously has not seen The Village. The restaurant scene was cringeworthy. Was expecting so much more after enjoying Us and Get Out.
329,Finally something that hasn't been done before. The movie is original and the plot line is carried out in a way that doesn't spoil anything or leave you guessing. The acting is fantastic and videography is beautiful as well. This movie definitely is deserving of winning awards!
330,"This is the first time I've written a review on IMDb, wanted to say that I enjoyed this movie. And Id love to see more movies like this. It does suck that the trailer did stir this movie in the wrong direction, advertising itself as this scary thriller, attracting the wrong viewers who were looking for something else. I say, so what to the trailer being way off it's a good movie. Deff one to add to my favorite movies list ⭐"
331,It is a bit disturbing... of course I found myself cheering for the main character. It's sad because it instigates hate and racism... For some strange reason it made me hate trump supports even more!! 😏
332,"If this same movie had come out last year there would be none of this political nonsense I keep seeing in the reviews. It's a horror movie, plain and simple. There's no message for society and nothing to gnash our teeth over. Truthfully it's an almost direct copy of an old twilight zone episode from the 50's/60's. Only then it was WWII and concentration camps. Let's not overthink it and just enjoy the art."
333,"If only the premise of entire film was at least as good as its beginning was.Why you may ask,well second and third act are rather messy and they have a lot of unfinished and overly complicated moments that should be simple and easy going but they are not..Characters are fine expecely our lead,she was the best part of a film and i cared for here till the very end.Story was like i said very good and interesting in beginning but how we were going further into plot and its twist ,the more i was starting to lose affection towards this movie.Ending was also very weak and the way how it was filmed was very lame.Antebellum was a watchable film but it had some weak staff to"
334,"I wish the movie was more in-depth, but other than that it was good!"
335,"This was one of the movies who's release was hampered by the corona virus. Set to release in theaters some time in early 2020, this movie was actually released to VOD instead along with other theater titles. The trailer for this film was extremely ambiguous and did not give us much info. All we knew from the trailer was that the movie somehow tackles racism. Surprise surprise that Jordan Peele is attached to this film. Now, Peele is obviously sticking to racial matter in his material, forming a unique portfolio, but unfortunately this movie was quite bad. The plot on the sleeve for this movie claims to be about a successful writer who is enjoying a night on the town with her friends when she is thrust into having to face the past, present, and future. This couldn't be farther from the truth as the movie opens with pure confusion and wrings every last drop out of a terrible start to any movie. I am all for ambiguity and i dont need plots spoon fed, but this beginning was just god awful. I figured it was the typical 5 to 10 minute opening scene that was possibly showing a sequence that is to come later in the movie. After the beginning went from 10 minutes to over 40 minutes, I was sure I was watching the wrong movie based off the plot I had read earlier. Then, something changes.. The movie gets SORT OF good near the middle while we are treated to the current time frame and are introduced to a few new characters which is where the decent recovery of this film comes to an abrupt end. Gabby Sidibe is a HORRIBLE HORRIBLE actor people... She can't even say a sentence with out making it feel unnatural or awkward...like seriously, her dialogue just SUCKED. Even more than the rest of the films dialogue. She is so annoying and apparently she thinks she is cool. She speaks with breaks in her sentences making her sound nervous or immature....ugh I couldn't bear it. The third act of this movie is also terrible as i was expecting a totally different storyline to evolve. Sadly, it did not and its safe to say that I would have been a better choice to direct since I actually anticipated a clever and unique ending where the roles were opposite in the near future, showing that the race war had ended and whites were now slaves. NOPE , this movie ended up being SOOO generic and honestly, the whole ""past, present, and future"" thing doesn't even make sense. The ONLY time frame our main character, Veronica, deals with here is the present, as a dream doesn't count as the PAST...and hours later doesn't count as the future....like DUH... This duo of directors are awful and this movie is beyond bad. In the beginning it was hard to even know for sure who was the main character as many side characters got more screen time than our protagonist... Jordan Peele should broaden his horizons and not stick strictly to films that deal with race... Liiiike, we get it bro. Now get over it and move on."
336,"It's interesting how bad reviews invite you to ""don't watch"" or ""don't waste you time"". The amazing opening will convince you to watch the movie through the end. And you will understand the motivation behind bad reviews.
For a country in which police kneels on a man and kills him, the movie provides a suitable picture.
You will enjoy the music and filming.
It's not a 10/10 movie, but you will enjoy it and, like me, you probably give a 10 to compensate racially motivated reviews."
337,"Found myself absolutely enjoying this movie. Starting you off by throwing you in the deep end, resulting in a hectic twist.
A definite must watch!Brilliant acting , cinematography stunning especially with the opening scene.
Awesome acting from Jena Malone and Janelle Monáe with the intense moments.Not sure why people actually gave this a low rating but the message was clear to Trump still wanting to have these statues of racist leader not taken down."
338,"This movie bring to me a disgusting feeling and the same time super strong sensation! Everyone should be watch!
This movie remember me the handmade's take, my favorite tv show ever!"
339,"I really enjoyed this movie. There were some small flaws here and there, especially with the directing and some of the acting (Jenna Malone, especially), and I agree that the trailer is very misleading, but I actually liked that, it brought some element of surprise. Janelle Monae was amazing in it and there were a few surprises that really caught me off guard.
I rarely write reviews here, but I thought I had to, cause after seeing the rating for this movie, I decided at first not to watch it. Saw a lot of reviews saying it was bad and not even a horror movie. Well, I finally saw it and now I understand why there's a lot of angry and salty people here reviewing.
Every time a movie depicts the horrors of slavery and racism, there's a lot of people that rush in just to say it was awful, or over the top, not true or boring.
It's ok to not like the movie, but saying it wasn't even horror is just a lie. Every story about slavery is a horror story. If you see this movie and don't think that's true, maybe you are part of the problem."
340,"The writers and directors(same two guys) did a great job of executing this type of thriller. They very much literally took the history of black slavery in North America and ran with it. The actors performed amazingly, and the cinematography and score was fantastic."
341,"All genre of horror are a reflection of our deepest fears, which have changed with different times and generations. For example in more recent years, think zombies - plague, infection, pandemic...? Think dystopian or apocalyptic - climate change, political instability, biological warfare?This movie is no more divisive than anything Rob Zombie churns out. I think if you watched this and found it lacking or inflammatory then maybe it did what it intended and the place you need to be looking to unravel your discomfort or anger towards this movie is actually inwards. It caused you to fear a world where black lives matter maybe? Where powerful women took charge of their own destiny?And I'm 'white' for the avoidance of doubt.Black lives matter.If that scares you this (horror) movie did its job!"
342,"I don't know what all those super negative reviews are talking about. I thought the movie was quite well done. Docked point for misleading genre classification. It's definitely not a horror movie but mostly a mystery thriller.For those who can't relate to the main characters, maybe they are still in denial about the systemic racism still existing in the US today and don't want to admit to it or face it's ugly face. Few countries are as obsessed with re-enacting past wars, especially civil wars as the US and it seems very odd the side that lost still tries to frequently glorify its past. I thought the movie did a decent job poking at the white-washing of a shameful part of US history.So aside from those still in denial of real US history, I do think the film made some connections to the audience. I was cheering for the main character at the end as she, shall we just say, achieved closures."
343,"I had read a review or two which seemed to completely ridicule this movie before I thought for myself that there was no way I could believe that Monae would be involved with anything less than stellar. I'm happy to say that I was right. I found this film to be brutal, yes, but more so in it's testimony. Good job."
344,This movie was way more than what people are giving it credit for. I think with the current situation in the world people are making this out to be something its not. Most the people who are super critical are that way from a political standpoint and thats painfully obvious.This was a great piece of art and I really enjoyed it. Its a fictional story based off the past. It's a stretch on reality but so are many movies. For some this may have deeper meaning and you can't help but respect that for being what it is.Before watching this I read through the hate on here and listened to a couple YouTube reviews and people need to learn to separate themselves from their echo chambers. Im glad I seen this movie and I say that as a white man who doesn't want nothing to do with right or left wing ideologies. Way to go for a couple new comers in the movie industry! I look forward to what else is to come.
345,Brilliant and thought provoking with excellent acting and script along with a twist ending-extremely well done.
346,"It elaborated on the statement of, ""We are not our ancestors!"" It meets every depressing slave movie at those moments where unempowerment prevailed, and charges through with strength and vigor. Most period pieces of this subject matterleave the viewer angry and frustrated with society. This movie, by some miracle of acting and execution, left me feeling excited, focused, &emboldened. Needless to say, I really enjoyed this movie."
347,"Great, well made, horror movie! Saw this with no preconceptions. It's rare to find well made horror movies these days but this is one of them. Gets a hold on the watcher within the first 5 mins or so. Then, when you think you've got it figured out, it makes a quick turn. Must watch. Forgot to mention, the cinematography is fantastic too 😉"
348,"This movie is worth more than 1 out of 10 like so many give here. Maybe they are offended by a particular message? It's not the typical ghost slasher horror movie, but there are plenty of those around. This is not predictable, has some nice easter eggs and I enjoyed it."
349,"Imagine everything you have, for better or worse is taken from you, and you're forced to live a hell you can only dream of in nightmares and read in history books, but unlike dreams you can't wake yourself from this one. That is Antebellum. The movie isn't a masterpiece, but it's definitely worth watching for any horror fan. There are quite a few scenes that wear far too many hats, and some eye rolling moments, but doesn't really take away from what the movie is about. Many reviewers here seem to be confused to what horror is; the atrocities of our societies intensified 3 fold. Revealing to its audience like a bell ring... I'd imagine most of the detractors people are white, and/or never really experience or had to sympathize for people that have it harder than they do. So there reviews seem a bit biased. Sure some of the performances were a bit flag waving (literally), but that's a trope in the genre so people should give a bit of a free pass. But they won't, because that's who they are... as they probably sympathize more with the antagonists than the protagonists. Watch it."
350,"The movie is good but the trailer makes you believe that these people have been pulled into the past when in fact it's quite the opposite. Even though it makes for a great plot twist it leaves you completely confused throughout the movie, I thought the acting was amazing and was extremely upsetting even more upsetting when you find out that it's in a civil war reenactment park because it tells you that this wasn't happening in 1800s American but 21 century American. Anyway the movie was great if you haven't seen then first of all why you reading this it said spoiler but anyway for all though's people out there who like to know the spoiler before the movie, go watch it"
351,"It is an okay film, but it could have been so much better!"
352,"People who write in their reviews that this movie has an ""unrealistic depiction of the past"" and furthermore that ""modern day America and slavery days are no where near one another"". Clearly don't see that systemic racism does exist in today's society and that juxtapositing the two time periods is what gives the viewer an interesting perspective. I enjoyed this movie a lot and the story line was really cleaver. This movie does struggle to fit into a genre which I believe is what makes it more interesting to watch. I highly recommend watching this movie and reviewing it yourself instead of going off other reviewers options."
353,This is a must see over and over and over again!!!
354,"I started off liking this but it all fell apart. They did a decent buildup setting an interesting groundwork then leaving to to crash and burn.Too many things were unexplained, hastily explained, alluded to and never elaborated etc. The first hour is pretty solid then they just shove the rest together. You can figure out where it's going somewhere around the mid point of the film which doesn't help. I so so wish I could get the crew together and just reshoot the second half of the film with some changes and you could have a really decent movie out of what they started with.The cinematography is good though. I'd rate the film itself as a 5 and the cinematography as a 7 so I'll leave this as a 6. It's OK but don't expect any resounding surprise."
355,"Flashbacks ( ? ) flash foreword who knows. After watching the first ten minutes I knew either the director didn't know his history or something was wrong here. Call me a nit picker but Details!! Cabins too delicately and cleanly made. Slaves too well dressed. Corsets for little nipped waistlines?? The biggest flub was the fitted sheet on the laundry line right in the beginning. After all that I stopped looking for flaws and tried to enjoy the movie. And tried, tried... The rest has been addressed by other reviews here. I don't need to repeat them."
356,"This film is immaculate. The vision of the writers is flawlessly executed. Monáe's performance is utterly seamless in the first act, never giving away the soon-to-come plot twist. The finale is a total show-down between good and evil, and the film's closing shot is cinematic perfection. I have to rewatch."
357,"The entire thing was ridiculous. The film quality was good, though. This rubbish was apparently well-financed. Please, no more black slave movies. Be more creative next time."
358,"I suggest reading the review from brando-22300. Nailed it.This movie wasn't what I thought it would be. I expected a typical horror movie, but this story took some of the real-life fears of what's going on in America today, took them to an extreme, and made it believable.Spoiler alert:
If you don't think this story is in the realm of possibility, then you should read about Jaycee Dugard who was held captive for almost 20 years. Or the women who were trapped for a decade in Cleveland.Maybe watch the news and see that there are some loud & proud racists who are willing to go to great lengths to turn back the clock. There are a few people in this country who cling to their racist traditions and are so threatened by POC that they are willing to do anything to prevent them from being treated as equals.This movie takes ""The Village"" and turns it on its head, and it's not easy to watch."
359,I thought this movie was amazing. It was suspenseful and exciting. And unlike a lot of thrillers it was not predictable. It delivered until the end! Definitely keeps you guessing. The only reason I'm giving it 9 stars is because it's not a horror movie. Should be Listed a thriller. Jenelle Monae is an incredible actress. I enjoy her in everything the acted in. This may be my favorite!
360,"I loved the movie! I don't understand the bad reviews. Movie is strong, real even if u deny it, possible in Trump's America."
361,"Same old propagandas wrapped in a paper thin script. With actors who can't act, being put in the front row. And those who could give decent performances, being given really small parts. And little screen time. I do not care how many times I'll have to rewrite this review. You will never stop me from speaking my mind about this movie I find particular bad and insulting. With how simplistic and predictable the topic was handled. Be simpletons all you want, but deal with the criticism that goes with it."
362,"Gave it a 2 because I think the editing and filming was pretty good.
I too got sucked in the producers, but stay away. A train wreck, how did this raise money to film? And Monae is a joke. She should not be acting..... stick to hair doo model.We stopped watching about half way, wish I could get that time back to watch ants crawl on the wall."
363,"The concept of this movie was astounding and based on reality. the horror IS white supremacy and the continuation of it in our modern day context-and it needs to be highlighted, and it was. the cinematography, music and acting was 💯 the plot was almost amazing, but it felt rushed and incomplete. the ending lacked finality and conclusion. i am so disappointed. i recommend, but understand you too will be dissatisfied."
364,"I watched the trailer a bunch of times and didn't have high hopes because of the rating... And just as you think you've figured it out, there is a major twist!I thought there was some paranormal or past life aspect, but it very much takes place in the same reality in which we live. It may not be a ""horror"" to some, but consider the main character. It's certainly a horror to endure.As an M. Night fan, I appreciated the way this film similarly flowed and felt."
365,"All I can say without ruining the movie experience is ""See Antebellum it's pretty amazing and incredible story""."
366,"Janelle performance are a bit cringey. I think she needs to be inproved. This movie also not so dramatic. Yes, there is a mysterious event you see , like is this really about time travelling and so on but no, you ill get to dissapoint because theres nothing much to see. Yes, theres also an political agenda and so on, so no so recommended to watch."
367,Amazing concept that isn't met with amazing execution. The story and acting needed more refining but regardless it's a movie I'd watch a couple more times for it's crazy horrific original concept.
368,Borrowed storylines. Wasn't impressed and didn't see anything new that hasn't already been done before.
369,"This is a thriller, not horror as advertised, which may have contributed to the negative reviews.
There are fluid and beautiful scenes throughout the film that contribute as much to the movie as the actors do, the twist comes early enough and subtly enough to prove amusing, and the climactic revenge scenes are sweet. The exposition in the ""dream"" segment could have been trimmed a bit, but that's my only real complaint.
Just watch it for what it is, a solid revenge thriller with a satisfying ending - and of course Jena Malone is the icing on the cake."
370,"I'll admit that the trailer had me intrigued in a weird sci-fi, time-travel nightmare sort of way. But the end product, while polished in looks, lacks the emotional core to carry it all the way through. Antebellum seems tailor-made to feed the audiences that welcomed ""Get Out"" with open arms, however, the difference here is that ""Get Out"" was envisioned (and scripted) strongly. This, on the other hand, utilizes the horrors of black slavery as generic horror movie tropes. And what's worse, it does so in an unconvincing manner.The film can be segregated into 3 acts, told in a non-chronological fashion. While the first act is a slow-burn exercise in 1800s slavery that features Eden (Monae) and several other black people being brutalized by Confederates, the second jumps to the present featuring Veronica (Monae, again) who's a feminist fighting for inclusion, and the third where these two timelines begin to blend. Treated with subtlety, Antebellum could have been a splendid film. But the third act is this film's undoing. It embraces a twist that comes out of nowhere; one that undermines the real-life horrors of slavery the first act so eloquently echoed.Writer-director duo Bush & Renz appear to be more interested in the shock value offering of their late twist than its possibilities of creating tonal inconsistencies. Therefore, we get an elaborate (makes-no-sense) action set-piece at the end which wraps things up in a humdrum way. The director-duo's fixation on music-video-like visuals (and slow-motion) is evident in the opening and closing stretches. In a better executed film, these would have been considered cinematic flourishes. In Antebellum, they simply look out of place. And yes, Monae deserves better!"
371,"This movie was chopped into three parts, it doesnt work this format many would agree. I am not sure how entirety of behind movie could not see major edits should have done. This appears to be with ratings numbers is recieving?! A very love it or hate it movie is my opinion.janelle monae did great as lead actor, watch past work, many future hopefully. The rest of the acting played their parts but nothing special. Even if not getting your interest into good amount, stick around for ending or fast foward to it. Am curious how ratings will turn out. People now on demand TV, or bought for Netflix, How many would have seen this in theare?! 6/10"
372,"Beautiful soundtrack, color, and lighting. Great acting. The storyline is very dragged out and leaves you wanting more with the abrupt finish. Could have been better"
373,"And as the BLM strengthens farther it maybe a provisionary look on todays antebellum like pre civil war tendencies that has erupted here and there in the world, especially in the united states lately, and its a take on the white supremacy foundation, that lingers in the background of it all .for a relatively neutral norwegian viewer its not a shocking movie, but should be an eyeopener to younger generations, like roots and 12 years a slave among others did.its a horror film with some ghosts of the past, but most of all its a modern riddle game, as it bounce back and forth in history. its also a feminism flick but thats the sideshow to it.i think ths film is beautifully filmed, clever use of darkness and sound, and enerving choice of score. the first 30 minutes made me speechless from awe, so when it turned into a modernday phase it became dull but a bit clarifying on the plot, and when the ''free mandiba'' phase started it showed the whole essence of the plot, well hidden by the makers, just a pitty it took such a slow paced way of doing it.the acting are mostly fine and i guess there will be many people that will look at this material as groundbreaking iconic stuff.the grumpy old man had some patience issues to the slow drive, but its a recommend"
374,"I was feeling it at first and then.... ""The Village"" theme kicked in early on. Felt forced and overacted in some places.... Gabby's character did too much for me (the restaurant scene was unrealistic)."
375,"*****SPOILER***** This movie is a great depiction of how modern day slavery still exists and black people aren't standing for it anymore. Period. When viewed from this perspective, this is an AWESOME movie. It's to be expected that lots of people in a particular group are going to rate this film poorly. Watching with an open mind allows you to see the power in the movie. This is a fine example of a artsy, peaceful protest."
376,"Antebellum is a movie about racism and how much this still affects the life of many, many people that fight every day to obtain equal rights, and this the main message of the movie. It is in fact important that all form of media keeps to sensibilize people on the topic, but you need to create at least a decent story. The premises are good, there is a lot of mistery around the plot, you don't really understand what is happening and the movie kept me interested until halfway then boring dialogues and long, stretched scenes start to appear. One example is when the main character Veronica speaks with her two friends in a restaurant. The scene goes on several minutes and leads absolutely nowhere.I was expecting an absolute bomb related to the plot twist, instead is pretty disappointing. The racism topic is treated in a different way that makes you think about the past, many progress have been done, but we have still lot of work to do ahead, in order to improve our society. If you are into this kind of stuff, maybe you will enjoy. If nit, you will be bored very soon.Antebellum manages more or less to stay afloat, thanks also to a cast formed by really good actors, unfortunately the very end does not make any sense. It is like they did not how to wrap up the whole thing, so they just throw a random scene."
377,"An interesting take and perspective on modern racism and deeply rooted sins. I might have preferred a bit more subtle acting at times, but it was still very engaging and I could heavily empathize at moments. The camera work and pacing is very smooth. It reminded me of 12 years of slave in some scenes, but it turns quite unique and symbolic later and some interesting novel genre mixing.
The story itself is quite skewed to a left leaning perspective, which is totally fine, but it would be nice to show some self referencing irony or some more nuanced perspective, because it felt a bit ideological limited in content. It should be fine to have a film with a hard perspective, but I think what is more needed today is to bring nuance to the dialog to open up the polarised views we have today.
Anyways, I very much enjoyed the film, it made me engaged, feel a lot of heavy emotions and react with complexing uncertainty, as well as a good film for afterthought and fun to talk about."
378,"What I just watched was a great film, like many films it draws on very real history but adds brilliant creativity and comes out with a fantastic suspense/thriller/horror with a great twist, brilliant acting and some all too real horrors being demonstrated.Yes it's black people in a film made by black people that uses black history but it is way more than that and if you simply take it as a movie and let go of the rest then it's a great movie.Really enjoyable watch if you're the sort of person that sees deeper than just skin colour, which I think is the point!"
379,"Before watching this movie I'd read a few articles covered on BloodyDisgusting, but I hadn't seen any trailers, so I went into the movie neutral. I had the pleasure of seeing it in a cinema.The first act was hard for me to watch with the systematic physical en mental torture of 'slaves'. Nothing too gory was shown which helped the psychological suspense and trauma I was experiencing. Up until the second act I thought this was going to be a gripping period movie about slavery. I especially apreciated the serious tone of the first act which was complemented with great cinematography and the acting of Janelle Monáe as Eden/Veronica.The second act had a surprise twist and it kept me guessing which direction the makers were going for. This is something I don't mind, if done well, and in the case of 'Antebellum' I think they tackled it well. In terms of story twists and designing them it made me think of 'I See You' (2019), another great movie I recently watched during the pandemic or 'Incident in a Ghostland' (2018).
The tonal shift in acting in the second act stood out a bit after the seriousness off the first act like the character of Jena Malone, who underwent a slight change in acting from serious to campy. The family of Veronica, although cute, felt a bit too sugarcoated for my taste acting wise. But especially Gabourey Sidibe's character was guilty of overacting, something she doesn't do in other roles like Precious (2009) which also has a butterfly on its movieposter. It not only made her character very one-dimensional, rude and unauthentic, but it forced the other characters also to make a tonal shift in acting. In the end it didn't ruin the movie, but it kept me from rating it with 9 stars.
I did like the subtle racial vibes from the hoteldesk worker reacting non-verbally to Veronica and the awkward table placement in the restaurant she arranged.The ending, although brief, paid off for me. It's scary there are people who think of black people as an inferior species who organize themselve to erradicate them and their rights right under our nose in ways of a hobby. This made the horror feel real for me because it's a reflection of what's still happening on a daily basis to this day.Many reviewers compare this movie to the 'The Village' from 2004, but I see more connections with 'Hostel' (2005) in which an evil organization kidnap and torture innocent people for pleasure. Change those psychopaths to racist psychopaths and the tourists to black people and it makes for an equal disturbing but less schlocky experience.I see many 1 star 'reviews', without any elaboration, telling the movie sucks because it's not horror or because people felt tricked by the promotion of this movie. Such a shame and a disservice of the movie, its makers and the subject matter. Go see it for yourselves."
380,"First off this movie isn't for everyone, so I get the mediocre comments. This is black excellence honey! When I seen the trailer I was a bit confused but after watching i understand. It's modern day slavery and this runs so deep. it's so much more that than what you see on the surface. An open mind would be great but if not this isn't for you, sorry 😐"
381,The idea for the movie is good but it was poorly executed in a bizarre clueless story. Not character/story development at all. I would not waste any time in it.
382,"I was really looking forward to this movie after I saw the trailer last year. I watched it, and...well. Hmm. What makes it particularly hard to review this movie is being able to critique without spoiling anything, but I'll do my best.This is a movie in 3 acts, almost like a play. We start with a Black woman who is enslaved and tortured on a Civil War-era plantation. Everyone is brutalized, and it is horrific there. We follow her story. In act two we see a powerful, accomplished Black woman traveling to speak at a conference and we get to know her life. And act three reveals all. Unfortunately, the big reveal comes at the very beginning of the 3rd act, 30 minutes before the ending when you realize the twist, so that the very end isn't a true reveal because you probably guessed it by now because what other possible conclusion can you make once your know the twist?This movie tries REALLY hard to show how horrific white supremacy and racism are (as they are), but gets super heavy-handed and over-the-top with symbolism, particularly in the third act. It beats you over the head with symbolism, in fact. That said, it is very suspenseful and a nail-biter because you don't know what will happen to the main characters in the film, and you feel empathy for them. The cinematography is good, the music also really solid and creates the right ambiance. The script is not great--I don't know a lot of folks who actually talk this way to their friends and seemed a bit cheesy in the 2nd act, so I think they could've done a lot better there. They also made Gabourey Sidibe's character inappropriately aggressive and cringey in certain parts--you'll understand if you watch.The visuals are flashy, and the overall message is good, but the execution felt kind of shallow and half-baked in some ways. I felt like they took an interesting premise, spent a lot of money on actors and cinematographers, but sorta dropped the ball on the writing in parts, particularly given the ending, which could have been much better and more interesting had they made different creative choices. The whole movie, I thought something far more creative as a possibility was happening in the film as I was guessing, and was ultimately disappointed that it wasn't as creative as I thought it was.That said, you might feel like it's still worth watching for the overall message and the suspense. At its heart, it's a decent thriller/suspense film, but promised more than it delivered in terms of writing and creativity. If you want another Get Out, you'll be sorely disappointed. Temper your expectationsand it will be decent for what it is--a suspense film with a relevant message.As a side note, my spouse figured out the twist from the start of the film and never felt like there were any real unknowns in the film, whereas I did not. The trailer definitely gives more away than it should--I would suggest not watching it at all and going in with an open mind."
383,"Another disappointment of the year. Not as eventful and thrilling as I had hoped for it to be. Unnecessary plot twist. It had so much potential to be its own unique horror story, but in the end, it flaunted itself to be bland."
384,"Absolutely horrible movie. Not a horror, not entertaining in the least bit. Don't waste your money. Completely pointless."
385,"There is so much cringe in this movie... please IMDB, add negative score because 1 star is too much!!"
386,"I really enjoyed this movie, Forget the negative reviews, watch it yourself."
387,"Surely (Antebellum)would be compared with (Get out) and (Us) because their themes were about the racist problem of Black people. But (A) was not directed by Jordan Peele but produced by Gerard Bush. Similarly, these three had a twisted storyline, a thought-provoking and surprising ending. Differently, (Antebellum) lacked cryptic ideas comparing with other two.The ending scene was shocking that Veronica got out from a Civil War reenactment park, because the story wasn't related to reincarnation at all. The park was recreated by White people in present day as a reformer plantation, which meant the kidnapping, slave labour of Black people were real. The endings of story was corresponding with the beginning quote of The past is never dead and it's not even past."
388,"This movie is definitely slow at first and got me thinking wow boring movie, can see why people would have left initially. but you have too actually give a movie a chance especially when you pay for it lol. big twist come the middle of the movie and it starts getting really
good and kept the both of us on the edge of our seat, actually outstanding movie and highly recommend"
389,This was a great interesting movie. I recommend it to everyone to watch. It kept my interest from beginning to end. Anyone saying its not a good movie to watch must agrees with what happen in the movie. We must watch to make sure this doesn't happen in today's trouble world.
390,"My wife and I watched this without having seen the trailer and knowing nothing, and after watching the trailer I'm so glad we did it that way! Not a traditional horror but still tense and disturbing at times, definitely worth a higher score than it has, I suspect people are scoring it due to political issues."
391,"I made an IMDB account just to express how much of a disappointment this movie is. The trailers are completely misleading. The movie jumps from scene to scene without a very solid story line. It all comes together in the end leaving you with questions, but the biggest question of all is why this movie was even created. It seemed very pointless nonetheless a waste of time. I didn't like the fact that you were confused in the second half. The first half had so much potential then to see it all go to waste. Jordan peele PLEASE EXPLAIN."
392,"The first 1/3 i was squirming. A bit confused how it fits the bio. Then story starts to make more sense (2nd act). Then the last act (as seems more appropriate upon finishing this masterpiece) left me knowing it was something absolutely fabulous. The writing, directing, acting... my reflection upon finishing it, is it's wonderfully done.The lead actress is absolutely wonderful. I love her so much. She carries this role perfectly. I'm so glad i took the chance and followed my curiosity. I believe this is so misunderstood for the low ratings. The suspense is so expertly done. Truly a classic in the making. Stay with it. I promise it delivers."
393,"I liked this movie,I don't know where this movie gets his bad ratings from. I'm glad I gave it a try. Just watch it,and you'll love it."
394,Absolutely loved this movie. Cinematography and acting is top notch. I guess some people are trashing it story wise because it doesn't serve them the white saviour narrative to make them feel good.
395,Thought provoking and important. Must watch! The cinematography is beautiful.
396,"For the first 40 minutes we watch slaves on a plantation during the Civil War. Then BAM! It is ""Cloud Atlas"" as we shift to the present time and follow the life of author Veronica (Janelle Monáe) who also talks about the white male dominate system while living in her upscale home. There is also a woman who talks about the past and future in order to give meaning to an otherwise semi-meaningless film.The cell phone thing had me confused as dreams become reality. Google doesn't seem to know of any instance where Confederate soldiers marched chanting ""God and Soil."" My guess it is presentism. The message of the film is as older than Soul on Ice. I think they should made the message more covert to make the film cleverness my concentration.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
397,"First, it is not mind-bending. I assure you it is 100% not. Second, it is not horror. This is somewhere between thriller, semi-mystery, and drama. No horror here or whatsoever you initially thought of. Third, the story is just short, expanded to 1hr 40 minutes. You can definitely summarize the whole film into one sentence. But for the sake of not giving spoilers, I will not. Fourth, the trailer definitely misleads you. It is not fantasy, mystery, horror, sci fi movie. It is only a simple drama, thriller, and a semi-mystery movie. Fifth, it feels like it tries to be ""Get Out"" but ultimately fails on all levels. In my opinion, it has no depth, no thrill, and not enough symbolisms. Will make you feel like it is an attempt on trying to be a ""Get out"" movie, but falls very incredibly short. While this movie is decent for me, I recommend you watch this only if you are bored."
398,"If u can figure out why there is a cellphone in 1862. Otherwise, don't bother. Basically, the movie sucked which is why it went straight to dvd. Hey, I have a really cheap copy you can buy from me!"
399,"I was blown away by this movie. It's a clever story and although it's not a traditional horror movie, it's definitely horrific and terrifying. This is a must see. It's a great story with a plot twist you won't see coming! I'm so glad I ignored the bad reviews and watched this. This movie left me reeling! I highly recommend it."
400,"The point of this movie is that the past influences the present. ""Antebellum"" is a movie that is beautifully shot - the colors, lighting, and textures that jump out at you are all very rich. It speaks a truth about the African-American experience, from past to present, that may be a little too real for some to digest (and they are regurgitating what America taught them through their unconvincing reviews). Those critics working for big name news agencies that have given poor reviews of the film, surprisingly authored by some people of color, are missing the point ... or are they? Begs the question of who they are working for and why they are attempting to stifle progress (exactly what this film is working against). As an African-American descendant of slaves living in America today, I understand what this film is portraying as it invites others in towards understanding some of the nuances of our culture. Just think of that face on the box of Uncle Ben's rice and why most of us who grew up in this country knew nothing about its very subtle and silent reminder of African rice growing knowledge and the early benefit it created for this great country (there are plenty of other examples that I won't get into here). ""Antebellum"" highlights the continuing American cultural practice of attempting to silence its original sin."
401,"Acting is great! Movie has a slow build up with a twist you will understand halfway. I was entertained ( and appalled at how Americans treated people) the whole way through.Don't watch if you just need action and blood from minute 5.To the people that said this isn't a horror.
It is a horror, what the American confederates did to black people is nothing less then a horror.To the people that said the ending is confusing.
How in the world is it confusing? Very clear ending!To the people that rate it bad because of their confederate heritage.
I am so sorry for you, after so many damn years still fail to understand basic humanity."
402,"I guess Antebellum isn't even close to the quality of Get Out and Us, but nevertheless it's an enjoyable movie. The movie seemed to miss a certain amount of passion and surprise, I mean ok; there's a twist but not one that you haven't seen more often. Since it's the third in the row of Get Out and Us I think it's time to look for something different. Even though the movies carry out great and very currently relevant messages, there are more than enough ways to get those same points clear. If they find a more inventive way to do so; then i'm sure they'll deliver a new masterpiece close to or even better than Get Out."
403,"This is just about watchable, it doesn't need to be 90 minutes, it would have made a great short film in 20 mins and you would have walked out feeling satisfied with the level of plot. I would also say this film stirred a lot of racial issues and maybe became slightly political, every issue the lead actress had was always about race, as a person of colour this isn't the real world and could lead to further racial divide which in this climate is the last thing we need. Overall it's a lot better then a lot of stuff out at the moment due to Covid so watch it, nothing decent coming out till next year anyway."
404,"This movie is about the park where people can felt somewhere in Civil War, where slavery was a thing. At first thought, from the trailer to poster, I thought it was gonna be a horror film but turns out it was a social-thriller film.
The first act and the final act were okay but the second act was kinda too long and boring. They spent almost most of the time to set up about how good the main character are and spent too much time on her friends and ""the movement"" that basically useless in the entire time for the movie.
Like I said the trailer might misled us, but it still gives some entertainment. I give a solid 7/10"
405,The film has an agenda and its not to entertain you. Woke nonsense from beginning to the end. without the woke rubbish it was still boring
406,"Janelle did a great acting job, but the writers and directors failed to get their point across. I wish I could ask redbox for my second day late fee money back."
407,"The plantation footage is well-done. Great editing and lighting. Alex Haley's Roots writ large, but lacking the seriousness, depth, and accuracy of Roots. Characters are very one-dimensional. Only heroes, monsters, and angels; which makes for a very facile and boring story."
408,"Dreams can come true! I guess.I thought I heard Antebellum was a fantastic and original movie and I was one-quarter right. It's somewhat original, but the story lacked 100% and I'm left with the feeling: this was a first draft from one drunk buddy to another.It's beautifully shot and acted and the costumes/settings were great, sure, but what the hell. Was this supernatural, real or both? I think it wanted to be one of them and never quite told us. I've seen plenty of movies that left the ending open for interpretation, but after the 1st third twist is revealed - and believe me, I did NOT see that coming, it never fit in with the rest of the narrative, despite any ""opinions.""Trying to avoid any spoilers, this is mostly about Civil War slaves and the nasty Confederate soldiers controlling them. But, it's also about other people's lives, that we barely get to know with the exception of the always wonderful Gabourey Sidibe who may of thought she was in a different movie. We definitely get to know her character.This is almost two hours - PLENTY of time to connect the dots and they failed. I don't need a playbook or exposition or even narration to make it easy, but I do need a coherent idea that binds the ending to the first two-thirds.And this is sad. This looked great and the opening act to that first twist made me heavily invested. They say this was from the producers of Us and I got that wonderful vibe.Too bad Antebellum wanted none of Us.***Final thoughts: Not to influence my review, rating or thoughts, I have read/watched no other reviews of this or watched the ""Ending Explained"" YouTube vids I love. Yet. I'm about to because I can't be alone here.(Okay, I did sneak a peek at Rotten Tomatoes just this minute at the end of my take, but not for the individual reviews. The 28% it got did, however, tell me I am NOT alone here.)"
409,This movie was not worth the 6 bucks paid to watch this movie. Until you learn what's going on the movie is bland and boring. Most of the actors were bland and uninteresting. The only one I found truly interesting was the friend and she was still kinda of a-hole. So I recommend not watching this movie
410,"I'm definitely not sure this movie needed to be made and I'm still not certain if the first half was a dream or what!!! The United States is too filled with people all to willing to participate in a horrid ""experiment"" like this to find the movie entertaining. I gave it a 5 because the acting was good and it was suspenseful, but out of a sense of humanity I could not recommend this movie to anyone."
411,"By saying, ""from the producers of ""get out"" and ""us"""" it leads you to believe that your about to watch another mind binding by horror film but I'm here to tell you, your not. This movie was poorly executed. It has a beginning and an end but everything in the middle is an unexplained mess. You think it's flashing back and forth through history but then find out it's present day. Then you find out that she's being kept captive at a southern tourist trap. The soldiers had cellphones the whole time?! They made the story jump around when they didn't have to. It made no since whatsoever. If you don't believe me, YouTube ""Antebellum explained"". The world feels the same. I'm gonna come out and say it but I feel like this movie was a try for a quick cash grab. They lead you to believe Jordan Peele had something to do with this movie and it was a couple of white liberal producers jumping on the race train the nations on. Don't get me wrong, I thought the cinematography was amazing and the acting was absolutely impeccable. The first seen absolutely broke my heart! Janelle Monáe was badass and it was some of Gabourey Sidibe's best work. I loved her character Bridgette!"
412,The terror of the Antebellum period encroaching on the present is truly a nightmare for some of us. Antebellum is a highly underrated film that expresses our worst fears.
413,"I'm torn apart between a 6 or a 7 for this movie.
It is clever, but it keeps pushing an antagonist conflictual race theme that (to my mind) can't help cure today's society. We do need to face the past, but we also need new ideas to face the future."
414,"A story with a ton of potential, but the directors squandered it by dragging on with unnecessary bull through the full first 2/3 of the movie only to have a solid 30 mins at the end with any story connections and actual entertainment. A waste of a great story to produce a cinematic tragedy. Overall 2/10."
415,"I thought this film was quite good, maybe 10 to long"
416,"Contrary to a lot of critiques, I think the movie was superb and very relevant to our times, a very polarized America where far-right white supremacists have been enabled and emboldened in the last four years! The cofederate soldiers marching with ticky torches chanting ""blood and soil"" is very reminiscent of Charlottesville! Ten out of ten for their directorial debut!!! PS thank God for Biden/Harris!"
417,"Antebellum: Nothing supernatural about this just the horrors of slavery. This terror is inflicted by white supremacists led by a U.S. Senator. They dress in Confederate uniforms as they lord it over abducted African-Americans, who are treated as slaves, made to pick cotton, serve as cooks and sex-slaves. Among these prisoners is sociologist/activist Veronica Henley (Janelle Monae) who has in the past clashed with Senator Denton (Eric Lange). Denton clothes himself as a Confederate General and takes Henley as his personal slave, branding her when she tries to escape and refuses to say her save name. Other escapees are executed, whipped, tortured. Truly a dark nightmare, extremely violent and disturbing in places, some of this when the ""slaves"" fight back. Not a film you will forget in a hurry. Co-Written and Co-Directed by Gerard Bush and Christopher Reinz. 7/10."
418,"I was confused on where this movie was going......then the modern tech came into play.(What!?).and I was further baffled but then I begun to understand. Some questions still need answering...But, in this day and age, open your mind and watch! Drink it in. I was quite surprised. It was a very interesting piece of filmwork."
419,"This movie was just plain awful!! Someone came with the idea, and told someone who totally ruined it. I don't see how this movie was even made!!! Avoid, even if it's just on the TV. If you're a fan of Janelle Monae, please do not watch this"
420,"This was actually a really good movie, well
acted and I don't understand the poor reviews. Give it a shot!"
421,"This was a good unique thought provoking movie. Wish I could say more in this review, but I can't to avoid any spoilers."
422,"Don't listen to any negative reviews. This movie is well worth the watch. Keeps you wondering what is going on. Sad, maddening, unreal, great movie. I was in awe. I am still in awe."
423,I knew about civil war reenactment plays but the thought never came to mind that the plot could happen in the 21st century with all the progress black people have made. What purpose other than hate for a people based on ignorant perceptions would people desire to continue having slaves?
424,"I really wanted to like this movie. The premise could have actually worked, had it been well executed. The acting...bad. The obvious symbolism...not thought provoking. The stupid decisions by characters...frustrating. In the end, I absolutely hated it. 2 stars because, hey, good try."
425,The trailer for this movie is totally misleading. I've enjoyed the other movies from this team but this dumpster fire is beyond horrible. It's boring and just plain hard to watch. The actors are great as expected but the story and execution are jumbled and lame.
426,"If nothing else, this movie is worth watching. I thought it missed on a couple things: 1) I thought there could have been some more about ""we're nowhere but we're everywhere"". Suggesting there are more pro slavery people out there, I wanted to see the movie explore that a little more & go further down the rabbit hole. 2) I think the timelines could've been more clear, it starts out suggesting this WAS happening in the time of slavery, only to discover that isn't the case, it was modern day the whole time, which had a ""the village"" feel to it. Overall, enough is tied together for the movie to work & as good as a movie as it was, I feel like there was some meat left on the bone. Check it out if you haven't, if nothing else, you won't be bored."
427,"I liked the Psychological Horror which was easily relatable to and not over done, like in Django. I liked the realism of it and the realistic ending, a supernatural ending would not have been as good. It was good it had a nice ending. I loved the see through hessian sacks. I also enjoyed the moments of supernatural creep the movie did portray. It was difficult to know where the movie was heading untill the end, it concluded well. The setting was historically accurate untill you discover the true time period. The actors where nice to look at."
428,"Never mind the film, what a beautiful woman. Sorry, that needed saying. Quite a good thriller, I had absolutely no idea what was going on until the last twenty minutes or so. The second section bogged it down a little, but did have you scratching your head. The conclusion was a little predictable when you realize what's going on, but to be fair, they kept you guessing and I can understand why people would not watch all the film. I have seen this idea before, but I'll not name the film because it will be a definite spoiler. Worth a watch, and Janelle Monae has got to be one of the most beautiful women on the planet."
429,Didint like the movie. The trailer was misleasing. People were walking out because they expected something else. And where was the horror?!
430,"I wont lie I never saw the trailer, I just watched the film when it was available. It is evident that it is a film on revolt which was triggered though cruelty inflicted on colored people.
Let me establish something this is one of those films that will justify killing by the protagonist as a African watching the final scenes of the film did seem rewarding and exciting but overall the movie carries accounts taking them a bit overboard."
431,"This might be the first film review I've cared to compose on IMDb. I felt compelled to, because for whatever reason so many negative reviewers seem hopelessly lost in what their expectations were for this film.Every aspect of this film was gripping, compelling, and well-acted. Nothing was over-explained, and you as an audience member were given plenty of information and clues to follow the story. Anyone who failed to do this, or didn't think that's what the film required in order for them to respect its appeal should probably stick with mindless summer blockbusters.Me? I prefer the realism - the grit - that films such as this provide. Films like this rely on more than just the words of the actors to convey thoughts and emotions. This film provokes both, and it does so very well. I genuinely hope to see more creativity and more deviation from so many films that are nothingmovies."
432,"This racially charged near-masterpiece isn't your typical horror movie but instead concerns the horror of slavery, which could be considered one of the worst horrors imaginable. The directing & cinematography is astonishing in places. The acting, for the most part, of a notably high standard with a stunningly attractive leading lady getting most of our attention. I'll resist going into details about the story for fear of ruining it but I'll say that the final scenes explain things and tie everything together well. You literally get that ""ohhh, now i get it!"" moment in the last few shots with a final reveal. Despite some logical inconsistencies in the plot and a lack of exposition, I'd still recommend this as a Must-Watch movie for any fan of psychological horror, it really is that good but falls just short of a masterpiece."
433,"I'm not going to tell you what this movie is about, other reviews do that better. I'll just tell you this movie surprised me on multiple levels. It is very single-sided and shows a lot of evil, but it's not a scary or a horror movie it also does not depict true history, but all of that doesn't matter since it is just a good movie.
You must watch it when an open mind though, especially with the weird ending which is more of an artistic freedom than story-telling.
If you like a non-compromising movie that does it a little different than others, ignore the reviews (including this one) and give it a try for yourself."
434,"One of the films that I circled on my calendar back in the beginning of 2020 was a trippy looking ""Civil War anachronism"" film (my term) ANTEBELLUM starring Janelle Monae. I'm a sucker for these kinds of films, so was a little sad that I couldn't see it in the theater, but was thrilled when this ""horror film"" debuted on pay-per-view in time for Halloween.I now know why the producers of this film decided to get this out now vs. waiting to release it theatrically sometime in 2021.Billed as ""Jordan Peel's GET OUT meets an M. Night Shyamalan film"", ANTEBELLUM is a movie told in 3 acts. In the first act, Janelle Monae's character (who is given the slave name Eden) is brought into a Southern, Antebellum, plantation. This part of the film shows the desperation and despair that slaves lived in at a time that they had no rights and were under the whims of their White Slave Owners. The character of Eden is fiesty and is constantly looking to escape, but...eventually...is worn down by her masters and capitulates...to a point. This is the most successful part of this film, but has been better covered in other films like 12 YEARS A SLAVE.The 2nd part of this movie takes place in ""modern day"" and concerns a successful author, Veronica Henley (also played by Monae). This character specializes in books and motivational speeches designed to empower the African-American woman. This part of the movie highlights Monae's appeal as a screen presence and she overcomes some weak writing to rise above. This part of the film, ultimately, falls flat for me, but I was curious as to how these 2 very different pieces of this movie fit together.The 3rd part of this movie answers that question. If only, it answered it better....for pieces of this part of the movie works well...but others fall very, very flat resulting, ultimately, in a less than satisfying film-going experience that could have used some further work.Monae's performance (for the most part) shines in this movie. She handles both characters that she is playing in a sharp, charismatic way. I could really buy that she is a popular ""motivational"" speaker (in the modern part of the movie). I could also see the fire in her spirit during the ""Antebellum"" part. What I didn't buy (and a weakness in the script doesn't help this part) is her ""capitulation"" to her slave owners.And...that's about if for performances that stood out. All of the white actors playing the slave owners (mainly Eric Lange, Jena Malone and Jack Huston) are capital ""E"" evil. While this is probably historically accurate, they weren't evil enough - or multi-dimensional enough - to keep my attention. Compounding that issue is that the other characters in the ""modern part"" of the film are very generic and forgettable.And then we get to the 3rd part of this film - where the first 2 parts are melded together.It is one of those types of storytelling tropes that either you ""go with it"" or you don't. If you don't, the movie will lose you right there. If you do (and I did), then it is an interesting place to go and blends the first 2 parts of the film ""well enough"". My problem is that I didn't care enough about the characters to care about what happens.I lay the blame of this on filmmakers Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. They co-wrote and co-directed this movie. I had never heard of them, or (I don't think) I've encountered their work before, but upon reading up on them, they are listed as ""Visionary Filmmakers Bush+Renz"". If they are visionaries, they sure didn't bring much vision here. It was all pretty straightforward and could have used some other kind of ""visionary"" to lift this movie to a higher level.You know, like Jordan Peele or even M. Night Shyamalan.Letter Grade C+5 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
435,The people that give this film a poor review might do so because it makes us confront some uncomfortable characteristics of humanity that still exist. Not fun right? I think that's exactly what makes it a good horror flick.
436,In williamsburg va...they have plantations where they reenact slavery times....to real looking for me to see
437,"It lacked some details and should have been longer.
It's basically (The Handsmaid's Tale) but with an African American twist.
It had potential. But there's something missing.The soundtracks are very good, though."
438,"I really anticipated this to be a great horror movie, in time for the Halloween season, from the presentation of the trailer. This is not a horror movie. Sibide's performance was the highlight of the movie, even though it isn't a horror movie."
439,"Great acting, good premise but weak script, loads of technical errors, & doesn't make good use of time."
440,Instead of taking you there but takes you somewhere else.i was truly dissapointed. Looks badly edited.
441,"My first thought of the opening scene was ""a tribute to Jordan Peele."" I did not like the feeling of confusion as I tried to figure out what was going on, so I decided to read reviews with spoilers, which helped, quite a lot. I wondered why such a successful author would use a ride share service instead of a bonded, licensed limo service or at least something with security. This film is fairly interesting and a unique story, but a bit of a let-down as a horror-thriller. I kept wondering if Jordan Peele could have improved it. As a native of Louisiana, it sickened me to have our people portrayed in such a disgusting, insane manner, but i realize it's ultimately supposed to be entertainment. I have no doubt that such whacked-out people exist, but expecting these fools to execute such a complicated plan is rather hopeful! The music was relatable to the mood, but too loud and jarring in some places. Overall, it's a decent movie to watch to pass the time if not taken too seriously."
442,"This movie is about an enslaved woman by the name of Eden living on a plantation in the antebellum south (Louisiana). The plantation is very violent and cruel; the enslaved individuals are not allowed to talk without being beaten or killed. But here's the twist: these events are occurring in the year 2020 at a Civil War re-enactment. Eden, whose real name is Veronica, is an intelligent and successful author whom has been kidnapped and forced into this sick pseudo-world.I think this movie went over a lot of people's heads. Is it a typical Halloween/Friday the 13th/Nightmare on Elm Street horror movie? No. Is it a horror movie though? Yes. It's a horror movie because, in my opinion, there is nothing more horrific than chattel slavery. Now imagine being kidnapped and enslaved (raped, beaten, dehumanized, tortured, forced into grueling manual labor) in 2020. That's what Antebellum is. An psychological horror flick about being forced into slavery in modern society. It's very reminiscent of M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Village"" except in this movie, the characters know they have been kidnapped. They are fully aware there is no war and they are not slaves, but they have no idea where they are or what is happening.It seems as if the people who are mad didn't quite understand the message this movie conveys: racism is alive and well in the world we live in today. Racism exists in our society and many are oblivious to it. This is not a stupid movie! Many seem to not like how the movie is structured and how it flows, but the story is interesting and entertaining!"
443,A good story with a twist. Loved to watch the revenge.
444,"Best cinematography and best BGM and strong acting
But plot nd location are kind of same of 12 year of prison movie!! but story and narration is different.
Good twists good entertainer go for it.. enjoy the film"
445,"This 2020 thriller tells about a female author/historian, Veronica (Janelle Monae) who finds herself experiencing traumatizing, racial slavery and tries to
solve a way to escape. This isn't bad, but could've been better in my opinion.
I like the score, Monae does a decent job and she's cute reminding me a bit of Kerry Washington (Django Unchained). The film has some dramatic, violent and tense moments. Give it a try only if you're into psychological thrillers or dramas."
446,"This isn't your typical white folks slave porn kind of movie. This is the realization of an unspoken truth and a reality that exists somewhere beyond the imagination of the creators; it is a reality in a juxtaposed world for some.
Janelle Monae is such an evolving force on screen. I have enjoyed watching her in various screen ventures. Her character in this film is exactly what it needs to be to carry the weight of the story line. She perfectly teeters on the edges of that modern day dream ""grind"" and the shadowed corners of what that grind is and/or will become with loss of focus. There is a darkness to the truth that some watchers will get instantly. Others will struggle with it because they see it as fantasy and untrue, these are the kinds of people who tell others to get over being raped and believe that all lives matters means other lives don't.
You WANT to have this experience. Watch the film and give your feedback, be heard here. It will be absolutely intriguing to see how this film is digested and who gets the nutritional benefits, compared to those whose systems will not tolerate or absorb its value."
447,Not the film the trailer made you thing it was. Clever plot. Takes a while to get going
448,"""The past is never dead, it is not even past""- William Faulkner
President Barack Obama used this quote in one of his famous speeches and it applies to this chilling movie.
A movie built on the foundation and the horrors of slavery and deep rooted racism in the South of America.
This is not a supernatural movie, it is a film with a black heroine who's voice cannot be silenced.
See this if you want to understand the black lives matter movement and how people of colour are treated by sectors of our society.
Here we have a movie that will haunt your dreams and nightmares from the Producers of ""Get Out"" and ""Us""."
449,This movie is good but it could have been sooo much better. I love the idea of the movie but I think with a little more effort the movie could have been a masterpiece. They could have really went more in depth. Antebellum is worth the watch thought. So watch it I enjoyed it.
