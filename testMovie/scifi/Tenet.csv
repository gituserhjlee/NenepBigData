He assumes people will actually want to see Tenet more than once so they can understand it properly, which some may not. This movie makes the chronology of Inception look as simplistic as tic-tac-toe.Ergo, it's hard for me to give an accurate rating, without having seen it twice, as I'm still trying to figure out whether everything does indeed make sense. If it does, this movie is easily a 9 or 10. If it doesn't, it's a 6.It's further not helped by the fact that the dialogue in the first 15 minutes of the movie is painfully hard to understand / hear. Either they were behind masks; they were practically mumbling; the sound effects were too loud; or all of the above. The exposition scenes are also waayyy too brief for something this complex -- a problem also shared with Interstellar actually.(Interstellar had this minimalist exposition problem explaining Blight, where if you weren't careful, you'd miss this one sentence / scene in the entire movie explaining that Blight was a viral bacteria:""Earth's atmosphere is 80% nitrogen, we don't even breathe nitrogen. Blight does, and as it thrives, our air gets less and less oxygen"").I guess it's a Nolan quirk. Hopefully, a revision of the film audio sorts the sound mixing out. I do like the soundtrack, but it's too loud initially.I liked all the actors. You think John Washington can't act at first, but he can, and he grows on you as the film progresses. And Pattinson is his usual charming self. Elizabeth is a surprise treat. And so on.Its worth a watch either way. See it with subtitles if you can. And definitely don't expect to fully understand whats going on the first time around."
1,"Well, I've always known I was a little slow to the party but this movie was hard to follow! It might have been the cinema sound mix but my wife and I kept asking each other what they were saying.. the script was hard to hear let alone understand in its abstract form.. we got the gist of the concept but was still hard to piece everything together in the end! I think it's a movie that requires a few watches to wrap ya head round it, but then again i am a little slow.. lol"
2,"As the first scene of Tenet came to an end, I looked at my partner and whispered, I'm lost. I'm lost and I don't think I'm ever going to get it.And I was right. What followed was two and a half hours of just an unreal amount of exposition that was distorted by music of SFX. If a film has to be explaining stuff to it's audience at the two hour mark then you've gone wrong. Plain and simple, I don't care if you're Christopher Nolan.Everyone I ask afterwards says that I will get it on the second, third or fourth try. Why does a film need multiple matches to understand it? Nolan is a huge advocate for his films to play in cinemas, which is great, but he must be detached from reality to think that most audience members can afford to go see the same film countless times, with the increasingly expensive movie tickets.Regardless of that, It's good that it was an original idea. But my god, if an unknown filmmaker had turned in this script to a production company, I'm pretty sure they would have thrown it away after 10 pages. The premise is cool, the effects are cool, but that is what you expect from a Nolan film. What I'm also coming to expect is a convoluted plot, terrible dialogue, and a film that will still hit over a billion at the box office."
3,"Its one hell of a complicated film. It will be very hard for an average viewer to gather all the information provided by this movie at the first watch. But the more you watch it, more hidden elements will come to light. And when you are able to put these hidden elements together. You will realize that this movie is just a ""masterpiece"" which takes the legacy of Christopher Nolan ForwardIf I talk about acting, Then I have to say that Robert Pattinson has really proved himself as a very good actor in these recent years. And I am sure his acting skills will increase with time. His performance is charming and very smooth. Whenever he is on the camera, he steals the focus
John David Washington is also fantastic in this movie. His performance is electrifying, I hope to see more from him in the future. Other characters such as Kenneth Branagh, Elizabeth, Himesh Patel, Dimple Kapadia, Clémence Poésy have also done quite well. And I dont think there is a need to talk about Michael CaineTalking about Music, its awesome. I dont think you will miss Hans Zimmer's score. Ludwig has done a sufficient job. There is no lack of good score in the movieGotta love the editing and post production which has been put into this movie. I think its fair to say this Nolan film has focused more in its post production.
The main problem in the movie is the sound mixing. Plot is already complex and some dialogues are very soft due to the high music score. It makes it harder to realize what is going on in the movie. Other Nolan movies had loud BGM too. But Audio and dialogues weren't a problemMy humble request to everyone is to please let the movie sink in your thoughts. Let your mind grasp all the elements of this movie. I am sure more people will find it better. Even those who think they got the plot. I can bet they are wrong."
4,"I have honestly never felt so confused after watching a film, a lot of people saying watch it twice but I couldn't put myself through that again.
The idea is good.. but they have made it far too complicated, a bit pretentious and unfortunately no real heart to any of the characters. Disappointed."
5,"A man on an international mission to save the world from the deadliest weapon of all, the future.Two moods: excessive incomprehensible exposition and LOUD incomprehensible action sequences. At no point do you know what is going on, nor are you given any reason to care. It is at all times tedious, meaningless and irritating. None of the characters are remotely interesting, much of the dialogue is inaudible and the ridiculous convolutions add up to nothing. And this cost over $200 million to make."
6,"Spending almost ten years working on the story, and five writing the script, in Tenet, Christopher Nolan is yet again examining the vagaries of time, a theme that's front and centre in Memento (2000), Inception (2010), Interstellar (2014), and Dunkirk (2017). It's undeniably fascinating to see a tent pole Hollywood production engaging with issues such as entropy, thermodynamics, reversibility and irreversibility, the grandfather paradox, and T-symmetry, all the while keeping proceedings housed firmly within the spy genre (it's a Bond movie in all but name). However, the film's main problems aren't related to the squandered existential potential, the much-ballyhooed complexity, the puzzle-like structure, the philosophical musing, or the thematic similarity to Nolan's previous work. Rather, they are more fundamental, existing almost entirely at a structural level (although some of the performances don't help matters, nor does the abysmal sound mixing). The film looks incredible, the practical effects in the action scenes are extraordinarily mounted, the cinematography is stunning, and the editing is superb, but there simply isn't anything of note under the shiny veneer. It's a film with virtually no interest in human beings.The plot of Tenet is straightforward in outline. We follow a CIA operative known only as The Protagonist (John David Washington) as he is recruited into an ultra-secret international espionage squad called Tenet. His mission is simple - at some point in the future, someone has figured out how to reverse the entropy of objects, effectively being able to send them back along the timeline without having to reverse time itself. The implications of this are catastrophic and have set humanity on course for World War III, and probable extinction, unless The Protagonist can figure out who is doing it and put a stop to their machinations.Tenet is an event movie in every way; this 150-minute, $200m+ original idea is a massive studio tent pole written and directed by the most popular filmmaker alive. And I will say this, the budget is on the screen. Oftentimes, you'll see a movie that's cost a ridiculous amount and you'll sit there thinking, ""they must have spent a lot on catering."" With Tenet, however, it's all there, front and centre. No small amount of that money, of course, must have gone on the practical effects (incredibly, the film has only 280 VFX shots) - whether it be bungee-jumping onto the side of a building, a close-quarters fight where one of the combatants moves in reverse, a Boeing 747 jet crashing into a building (which was shot for real), a highway chase where some of the cars are going forward in time and others are going backwards, or an all-out battle scene where, again, some of the soldiers travel forward whilst others move in reverse.It's one of those films where you'll genuinely be asking yourself, ""how the hell did they do that?""; a question that's become increasingly rare in our CGI-reliant times. Along the same lines, the cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema is stunning, as he mixes 15-perf 70mm IMAX film with traditional 70mm stock and a few 35mm sequences in a manner where the shifts in aspect ratio are barely noticeable. It's the kind of film that could only exist in the medium of cinema - no other art form could even begin to approximate its aesthetic design and splendour. A celluloid purist, Nolan has always made a big stink about the artistic importance of cinema, and Tenet finds him pushing the aesthetic boundaries of what the art form can accomplish.Unfortunately, no matter how visually unique or aesthetically impressive it may be, no amount of gloss can hide the fact that the screenplay is a turgid mess and suffers from some fundamental problems - most notably, it's bereft of emotion and populated with cardboard cut-outs that are supposed to be characters. The problems start early when The Protagonist is told that the future of humanity depends on his mission. This is precisely when I started to tune out. Any film that declares its story is none-other than saving humanity has gone so big as to render the people who populate its narrative as insignificant. It's also a cliché, it's dull as dishwater, and we've seen it done a million-and-one-times.As for the characters, good lord, they're badly written. The Protagonist isn't a person with an interiority; he's a cypher, the audience's surrogate so that Nolan can explain the plot to us. And there's nothing more to him - he's utterly emotionless, seemingly void of any kind of relatable motivation, has no psychological through-line, and nothing even resembling a character arc. As for Kenneth Branagh as Russian oligarch Andrei Sator, think of the most clichéd Russian villain you've ever seen. Now square that and you'll be some way towards imagining how ludicrous Sator is. He isn't a person - he's a collection of near-satirical tics, clichés, and elements from other, better films. Maybe with a more menacing actor in the role, it might have worked, but all I could think whenever he was on screen was ""that accent is hilarious."" Robert Pattinson's Neil (The Protagonist's handler) and Elizabeth Debicki's Kat (Sator's wife) fair better, but neither set the screen alight. Along the same lines, much of the second half of the film hinges on the fact that The Protagonist and Kat find themselves drawn to one another, yet Washington and Debicki have zero chemistry. At a human level, there's nothing to take a hold of the audience, nothing to make us care about any of these people.Speaking of Kat, a common criticism of Nolan's filmography as a whole is that his female characters tend to be victims whose deaths motivate men or who need saving by men, and/or women who define themselves almost entirely in terms of their relationship to men. Now, I'm not saying that Nolan is obliged to write more rounded female characters. He isn't. Much like one of his favourite filmmakers, Michael Mann, Nolan's films are androcentric. And there's nothing wrong with that. However, in Mann, there are to be found strong female characters with considerable agency, whereas in Tenet, Kat is nothing more than a pawn in a game played by powerful men who effortlessly control her. She defines herself almost entirely in terms of her role as a self-sacrificing mother, and whilst this is an interesting trait the first couple of times it comes up, by the time Nolan is reminding us of how much she has sacrificed for the 237th time, it had become obvious that this was going to be the extent of her characterisation.At one point early in the film, The Protagonist is told ""don't try to understand it, just feel it"", which is advice that Nolan is also offering to his audience. The problem is that there's nothing to feel. Tenet is a puzzle, the impenetrability of which will depend on each individual viewer (and how much of the appallingly poorly-mixed dialogue you can make out), but unlike Memento (which remains Nolan's best by a long way), which packed a seriously emotional gut-punch when we finally learn what was at the heart of the puzzle, Tenet offers us nothing more than the task of deciphering it for its own sake. There's no payoff. There's nothing to make us want to penetrate a story that seems more intent on reminding us how clever it is than trying to depict real people or establish real emotional stakes; it's a film more enamoured by the complexity of its own design than by any of the people contained within. It's an emotional void - all technical virtuosity and surface sheen with next to nothing at its core."
7,"I am a big Nolan and Sci-Fi fan, and there's no question serious effort went into this movie. No question, the visuals were great, the acting was great, but the editing, PLOT and over-all effect was simply unsatisfying.The plot is full of discontinuity and random plot elements, and the main time reversal issue is never adequately explained, resolved or identified, and even the cryptic ""Tenet"" keyword never seems to appear outside of the trailer cuts. The most annoying aspect was the often incomprehensible audio, due to masks and bad editing, that made many key moments a total mystery.The plot is also littered with bad science of every possible kind, random statements that simply make no real sense (even using the odd time scenario) , and when viewed as ongoing story make you stop and say, how did we ever get HERE? The gun and bullet demonstration really sticks in my mind as total and complete cinematic plot garbage.I don't doubt this could have been a masterful movie, but unlike Memento or Inception, the script and story continuity were simply not up to the complex story task. The one word that sticks in my mind about this movie is disappointing. After the long delay, i really expected something a lot better than this. Maybe a later edit will fix this, but it certainly doesn't need to get any longer."
8,"Background music is so loud, and most of the actors mumble their lines. Guaranteed headache and impossible to understand the plot."
9,Listen we all know Nolan swings for the fences of what's possible and pushes the realms of normality. This film for whatever reason just doesn't mesh together the way most of his films do even with complex suspension of disbelief aspects. It's often scattered and juxtaposed to a near outrageous level. The visuals are spectacular at times but also seem way too extravagant to take seriously other times. Robert Pattinson is flawless and probably the standout of the film with his vigorous performance. The same cannot be said about John David Washington's barren and emotionless lack of effort. I can't believe he was given the starring role. He brings the interest level down to almost unwatchable levels. Overall this is one of Nolan's rare misfires which he is capable of once in awhile.
10,"Big Nolan fan here. Doodlebug, Memento, The Prestige, Inception, Interstellar - all fresh and evocative stories. Needless to say, the bar was high going into Tenet.I had already seen the first ten minutes some months earlier in a preview which had left me enticed for more pieces of a seemingly new Nolan-y brainiac puzzle.Unfortunately, this movie feels like a self-parody.It starts off well enough, and the backward visuals look interesting enough, but gradually everything starts to feel very gimmicky. The ""message"" isn't revealed until somewhere around the last fifteen minutes, and mostly as a sort of parenthesis or footnote, and by then I had sat through two hours wondering who the enemy was, what they wanted and why I should care (Sorry, but WW3 is way too abstract a term for me. How? Over what? Why? What is at stake?). The explanation felt cliché and exploitatively woke-y. In the film, the last lines were treated as a thought entirely unique and amazingly deep. Wtf? Did a high schooler write this?The ""inversion"" part felt like an excuse to do cool visual stuff (which felt worn out very fast) instead of a basis for the exploration of a theme through story.The score felt intrusive, loud (my friend had to cover their ears in the cinema) and painfully on the nose. I bet a lot of the dissonant music came from some ""genius"" idea of playing melody backwards. Sorry, ranting a bit now, I digress...I watched my hope for a good story get crushed in non-stop action and chaos built around cardboard cut-out characters with no charm or personability. The actors seemed to be doing the best they could with what they had been given. The dialogue was, more often than not, laughable. Especially Debicki's character's lines were so cringe-y at times I could not believe what I was hearing.Glamorous environments, expensive clothing, global jet setting and VIPs carrying the fate of the world in their hands. Is this an attempt at trying to launch an updated modern Bond franchise?The film is competently made (cinematography, editing, production design etc), thus earning its five stars from me, but the story/execution is, I am sorry to say, sh**.This isn't a brainiac puzzle so much as a director lost very far up his own a**. Even Kip Thorne did not want to be associated with this nonsense!Contrived, chaotic, noisy, a director reveling in his own (convoluted) ""smartness"". Nolan, I have loved your stories in the past. Wth happened?"
11,"Mind bending? Okay yes in a way its hard to follow whats exactly going on sometimes, but its so senseless in a way it hurts.The worst thing to me is the whole purpose. No smart evil plan to conquer the past, or make use of time travel features to stop climate change. No, Just a simple sick evil russian who will die anyway and wants to take everyone with him. The rest around the plot is his boring wife with her kid, we never actually see or care about. New people Just appear, dropping huge heists with Zero preperation. I know they did it already in a Loop multiple Times Blabla, but as a watcher its not convincing in that moment, not immersive, even confusing and clearing that up in the last 10 Minutes of the movie, doesnt make up for 2 hours of boredom.science not plausibleweak charactersstupid russian villain - American Hero, made up Story""mind bending"" stuff aside - just not goodtoo long (fighting scenes are used all twice..... because of the beautiful loop)sound horribletoo much pengpeng and no good dialogueLast 10 Minutes of the movie Twist ""Here the real Message of the movie"" - Like, now its a masterpiece because tada, timetravellogic all ....come onIm gonna watch it again! Backwards, and hope i get my wasted time back."
12,"The movie started with a very intense ""Batman"" like opening. This movie showed promise the first twenty minutes and even though nothing made sense, there was still hope that it would all be tied together and all make sense. Unfortunately, hope was lost quickly and the plot disappeared into a endless past-future alternate reality abyss and never came back. This movie lacked depth and seemed pretentious from Nolan. A truly intellectual ""flex"" that surely he had no idea what was going on either. If there was one good thing from Covid is- very few people have had to sit through this disaster of a movie."
13,"As this will be non-spoiler, I can't say too much about the story. However, what I can is this: Tenet's story is quite dynamic in the sense that you won't understand it till it wants you to. So, for the first half, your brain is fighting for hints and pieces to puzzle together the story. It isn't until halfway through the movie that Tenet invites you to the fantastic storytelling by Christopher Nolan.Acting is beyond phenomenal, and I'd be genuinely surprised if neither Robert Pattinson nor John David Washington doesn't receive an Oscar nomination for best actor. It's also hard not to mention how good Elizabeth Debicki and Aaron Johnson both are. All around, great acting, and the dialogue amps up the quality of the movie.The idea of this movie is damn fascinating, and while there are films that explore time-travelling, there's never been anything quite like this. It has such a beautiful charm and for the most part, explains everything thoroughly. It feels so much more complex than any form of time-travelling we've seen, and no less could've been expected from Nolan.Oh my lord, the score for this film fits so perfectly. Every scene that's meant to feel intense was amped by a hundred because of how good the score was. Let me just say though, none of them will be found iconic, but they fit the story and scenes so well.In the end, I walked out, feeling very satisfied. Nevertheless, I do have issues with the film that I cannot really express without spoiling bits of the story. There are definitely little inconsistencies that I found myself uncovering as the story progressed. However, I only had one issue that I found impacted my enjoyment. That issue was understanding some of the dialogue. No, not in the sense that the movie is too complicated, but more that it was hard to make out was being said at times. It felt like the movie required subtitles, but that probably was because, at a time in the film, there was far too much exposition.Nevertheless, I loved this film, I'll be watching it at least two more times, and I think most of you in this group will enjoy it. I definitely suggest watching it in theatres if possible, just so you can get that excitement.(4/5) & (8.5/10) for those that care about number scores."
14,"..to fully understand, you better make sure that it is really worth watching it 2-3 times. And this one is not.
And I find very arogant to even propose the idea of rewatching it and even more, using it as a negation of all the negative critics."
15,"This movie may be glossy and pretty to look at but since it's utter nonsense it's difficult to care. The entire concept makes no sense. No characters to care about either, they are just there as set pieces."
16,"I love the work of Mister Nolan, but it didn't work this time.
The film lacks of pace and charisma. Sometimes it's boring to keep watching.
Maybe he tried to hit the originality of ""inception"", but the editing and the story didn't help.
The sound mixing is really good as always and the Kenneth Branagh's performance is the highlight of the movie.
Some fights scenes are close to childish execution.
Anyway, I hope Nolan does better in a near future."
17,The speech is very mumbled and not clear. The audio dialogue needs remixing and the background score and effects need lowering in volume. The character builds are non-existent. The plot is predictable. Action and special effects are very good but not ground breaking in this age when anyone can really shoot HD and then play it back backwards. Needs a second watch with sub titles.
18,"Nolen tries too hard to be clever, all it does is lead to a overly complicated movie, full of plot holes.Nothing really happens, you feel absolutely no emotional connection to any characters, i couldn't have cared less if any of them died or succeeded, wasn't invested in any of them. No character development what so ever.Sound mix was terrible, i couldn't hear half the dialogue, and the action scenes were stupidly loud, my mother was covering her ears and said it was actually painful.Critics are rating it purley because its the great Christopher Nolen, and they are scared they'd be seen as stupid if they said anything other that this is an amzing film. I am not a Nolen basher, i love literally every movie he has done, and was very excited to see this, most disappointed i have been since IT Chapter 2."
19,I'm a massive Nolan fan and love Inception which I was hoping this was going to be like but it's nothing of the sort and very poor! The story isn't that complex once you finally find out what's happening but for a Nolan film I expected far better.
20,"If you can, get to a cinema and watch Tenet.If you can, watch it in IMAX.If you can, watch it twice.The film takes reality and plays it backwards and forwards at the same time. A mind bending, action packed experience like never seen in cinema before."
21,"For all those who state that 'TENET' is a masterpiece, let alone original, i suggest you go watch 'Predestination (2014)' as it handles the same concept, time-travel loop/paradox, with more essence and touches the philosophical side of it without the gimmick reverse tricks, pseudo-science and abstract editing that TENET threw us in our face just for the sake of it.
PS:'Top Secret (1984)' reverse scene is the best!"
22,"On paper, Tenet should have been as good as Interstellar and Inception. There are definitely similarities between these Nolan films - which in itself is not a bad thing as you know you're in for a challenging interesting and visually amazing experience. But there are 3 differences between Tenet and those films:
1. The cast and performances in Tenet are weak, and you just don't care about any of them. Washington's character just wasn't interesting and was pretty boring. Basic film making = make characters you can care about.
2. The dialogue is fast and quiet (the background sound is way too dominant) so within the first 20 minutes you're already not following what's going on. It's not the viewers responsibility to watch a film 3 times because the sound production dept can't do their job.
3. Visually boring. There was a blandness about many of the sets. Remember the Japanese house at the start on Inception? And the ""sea world"" in Interstellar? Tenet lacks imagination and everything looks boring.
4. Complexity in itself doesn't make a film interesting. Tenet is just too complex and isn't worth it. It's a quzzle you don't care if you don't solve. There are lots of film that don't lay everything on a plate for the viewer (e.g. Enemy, 2001 Space Oddisy etc) but they're WORTH it.For the first time ever, I nearly walk out half way through. I endured to the end and was glad it was over.I'm genuinely surprised that there are so many 10/10 rating for this. I'm pretty good at following complex films but Tenet is just tediously complex.There are some good things about Tenet (Pattinson and Brannagh's performances), but overall, Tenet is poor."
23,"Christopher Nolan for me is easily one of the greatest directors of all time and quite possibly the best director of the 2000's, so it pains me to say this......TENET is a complete mess.The attempt at explaining and ""weaponizing"" non-linear time theory just becomes wayyy to complicated in the film that it draws you completely out of the film. It creates such cheesy dialogue and by the 3rd act I just didn't care at all whether they win or lose. I just wanted tthem to SHHHH.Both out leading actors, tried their best, but they just were not believable in their roles. It was so bad that I actually fell asleep during the villains evil speech in the last act.And the idea of a algorithm in physical form I mean C'MON."
24,"It's been a long and bumpy road to release but the blockbuster event of the year is finally here. While lockdown may have warped people's perception of time, nothing can quite prepare you for the brain-addling time distortion on display in Christopher Nolan's latest feature Tenet.From its heart racing opening to its dual-timeline finale, Nolan pushes the boundaries of how film is presented and meant to be consumed. Playing fast and loose with chronology, Tenet is built like a puzzle with a story that folds over itself enough times to make you believe the screenplay was built from origami. Put simply, the film demands numerous viewings to untangle its interwoven narrative and will undoubtably attract a myriad of interpretations.Tenet also arrives at a time where cinemas are facing an uphill battle attracting audiences as they begin to reopen around the world. Luckily, Nolan has never been one to compromise the ambition of his films by doing things by half-measures. With its operatically staged action sequences and Ludwig Goransson's pulsating soundtrack, Tenet is a complete sensory overload that offers a cinematic experience not to be missed."
25,"Intelligence isn't how many books you can read or if you have a degree. Accurate intelligence is about how self-aware you are with your intuition and how loving you are to yourself and existence. Therefore, if your behaviour isn't changing, then you're not growing. Some people are so focused on technical knowledge but lack the big picture, and because of this, they're emotionally unstable and stuck in life. You can have all the technical expertise, you can be an expert in your professional field but have no idea of the big picture.Tenet is the perfect example of focusing on lofty ideas and concepts, and forgetting the importance of film, which is human behaviour."
26,"If you find movies with nameless characters pretentious, this will fit nicely into the pattern.Not only the protagonist is nameless, but he calls himself The Protagonist- how hilarious. ROFL. The Protagonist is the new James Bond, but not as funny. His story is a graceless mashup of Memento (reverse playing) + Inception (sharp-suited men moving in designer's environments) + Dunkirk (boys club of fighting and running around aimlessly).The Protagonist and his sidekick Neil also do a bit of time travel, to stop an evil - obviously Caucasian - enemy from destroying the world. Evil guy's name is Sator, and there's is also a firm called Rotas, somebody called Arepo and part of the plot takes place at the Opera.Once Nolan's done in trying to impress you with the Sator square, he adds the quantum arrow of time and reversing entropy, mixes it with the most banal female role you can imagine (a trophy, mistreated wife who loves her son very very much), a car chase, a couple of fist fights and an involuntarily hilarious and chaotic final scene involving a red and a blue team (Matrix anyone?).The ending involves a rip-off of Casablanca, with the two male heroes metaphorically kissing goodbye (or hello?) and more of The Protagonist being hyper cool.I understand Nolan likes 5 stars, slick hotels, luxury interior design, expensive suits and first class travel around the world. Also, he's not the sentimental type who can make you sympathise with his characters, but absolutely not giving a damn about any of them doesn't help enjoying this movie either, exactly because the plot is quite banal, but dressed up nicely with some smart - but condescending- gimmicks."
27,"Christopher Nolan is my favourite director of all time. However this is an enormous banana skin of a film! Visually spectacular, but it falls way short on:General narrative and plot developmentCharacter development and any kind of emotional attachment to charactersPacing (It's ludicrously fast)Audio (Not sure what they did in post production to make it so bad but some dialogue scenes are almost incomprehensible).I felt angry watching the film, which is a first for me. Feels like Nolan is giving audiences a huge middle finger In trying to keep up, this film arrogantly revels in its own complexity."
28,"Tell me, if everything is going backwards, should't they speak out the words and sentences the same way - backwards? But no, they speak normal laguage.
And if you think about logics and details, it's the same - it's only flaws in there.
Acting is okay, though, and visuals are great. But if you are looking for sense, it is not the case."
29,One of Christopher Nolan's most fascinating movies yet . The inversion concept is unique & outstanding. The performances are excellent. The cinematography is super. Some scenes are simply breath taking. It's a visual art. The action and practical effects are incredible. It does require a lot of concentration and possibly multiple watches.
30,"Why should a English language film need subtitles, this one needs it, why do you have watch it twice, because it's laughable confusing, this is a joke, incomprehensible, the only thing it proves is that you can rewind film, we know that, I have an IQ 139, I love good movies, but this was a headache, between the incoherent narrative and the unbelievable plot, it's a turkey, don't buy into the rhetoric that it's somehow special , it's not, it's annoying that's all."
31,"This is an action film packed with fast-paced fight scenes and rapid plot twists. But the film is disappointing in every respect. Most importantly, the plot is uninteresting and the characters are simplistic and shallow. The sci-fi twist of the story is ridiculous.The men are of simple man's-gotta-do-what-man's-gotta-do types. And women are portrayed as usual in Hollywood films: beautiful objects, caring mothers, or vengeful lovers. None of the characters appear as real human with cognitive depth. There's no discussion, no reflection, no personal growth. The plot relies on naive narratives: the hero must save the beautiful girl, the mother will do anything to save her child, the betrayed lover seeks for a revenge, the omnipotent antagonist wishes to destroy the world due to personal vanity. What's new, Nolan?The pseudo-scientific idea of reversing the time is yet-another crazy Hollywood plot twist that does not have any scientific basis. As a scientist the film makes me laugh. It seems that the action genre as a whole has been completely exhausted, so the only way to create something ""new"" (and to keep the viewer from falling asleep) is to make the cars run backwards.Some people think that the film is interesting (""masterpiece"") because the plot is complex and you cannot spot all the details on the first watch. Well, I did spot most of it on the first watch and ... it was not interesting. The story is predictable and does not provide any new ideas that haven't been dealt with in previous films. The underlying philosophy of the future of the world and righteousness is naive and simplistic."
32,Was there ever an actual good idea for this movie? If there was it was 100% lost in translation. One of the most frustrating and ridiculous movies I have ever seen. And the music over the vocal audio all the freaking time is plain stupid. Not only is this movie not worth paying for it's not worth your time to watch it for free.
33,"Well, so much for my favorite director.
I used to like pretty much everything he was coming up with. Yeap, including Dunkirk. But, it seems to be true: all good things come to an end.
The characters are not likable, the motivations are confusing and inconsistent, at times even not believable. The story is full of cliches, event includes a communists-forced bare-hands-plutonian-picking Soviet children turn oligarch...
Uninteresting.
Disappointing."
34,"Whilst I admired the cinematography, the backing soundtrack and music was too loud, sometimes louder than the dialogue.
Two and a half hours seemed to go on and on with not much happening, a lot of repeating itself?
Perhaps I am that average film goer and should stick to Eurovision.
The six people in our screening stayed very quiet.
I liked the Michael Caine cameo appearance."
35,"The film gets very repetitive. The action is nothing but unnecessary chaos. The lead actor cant act for sure. His walking mannerism, his body language n his facial expressions r duds.
Better watch Terminator 2 or James Bond films.
The character of Priya n the shooting in Mumbai is added jus to attract pseudo intellectual viewers from my beloved country India.
The rote learned physics students from my beloved country will be in awe of this film.
Nolan aint aware that physics students in India need to work more in the laboratories to put the theoretical knowledge to use.
The wannabe critics from my country will unnecessary give this film more stars so that they dont look outcasts."
36,"I wanted to love this, but it was impossible.I maybe understood 20 sentences in the hole movie.
The sound mixing was so utterly bad, that it could've worked as a 1920s silent movie, except that it was so loud you'd get a tinnitus.Actors where either muffled through gas masks or backward speak translated through walky talkies. On top everything was drowned in the phenomenal soundtrack.It was impossible to follow the complex plot.
I focused on the eye candy and hoped it would end without me taking hearing damage"
37,"I am afraid I didn't like this movie at all. And I think it can be counted as another example of very poor story-telling wrapped in veils upon veils of money. Empty.There are many things wrong with the script. For instance, an hour of the movie passes without there being a clearly delineated ""bad guy"", when he finally emerges or should I say, when the audience settles for the Russian Oligark as the major threat in the movie, we are not given much in terms of his motives. We don't know much about the motives of the protagonist either, mostly he serves as someone who receives or gives exposition, and in a horribly obvious way. And exposition continues to be given throughout the movie, it seems like there is no solid vantage point from which the movie can really begin, it just keeps fumbling around blinded by its own or the script-writers narcissism.Even though the characters refer ro many abstract ideas; inversion, entropy and algorithms, it seems that Nolan has a very low tolerance for abstraction and for things to play out suggestively. I think the inversion-machines especially are a good example of how concrete everything has to be. There is no room for mystery. And I'm not talking about confusion, it's not the same thing. The film is ripe with confusion, but there is no true mystery. Inversion is an interesting concept, but with the very cerebral attitude towards it, with no feel for how you could use it imaginatively to tell an interesting story, with all ""tell"" and no ""show"" it just stops being attractive.Sure inversion can make for some good action scenes, but what if the Oligarks real motivation was to live forever, what if the theme of the movie was really the fear of death, and people wanted to zig-zag back and forth in time to escape death? What if the protagonist had been seduced by this possibility and wanted to live forever too? Wouldn't that have made for a more interesting movie, for emotions you could relate to?As many others have said the score is obnoxiously loud and ever present. I was really longing for momenta og silence like a breath of fresh air. The Oligark's wife keeps mentioning her child, but we never see any connection between them, so why should we feel invested?The only enjoyable thing was Robert Pattinson who brings a bit of humanity and charisma to this sterile universe."
38,"It really confused me when I watched it yesterday. I can honestly say that I probably missed lots of details even though it came around in the end and settled nicely.
I am sure that people who dive into the details will find these bits and pieces and time will help to digest the whole story.
No matter you hate it or love it but you have to admit that the movies from Nolan are simply so innovative which the current movie industry simply cannot reproduce. He writes the story itself, he directs, chooses the actors, the locations and he mainly uses real world setups instead of computer generated ones. He is so creative and luckily does have the financial background to complete his plans.
I think the main flaw of this movie that the viewer can feel unsatisfied at the end due to the complex setup and this brutal backwards mechanics."
39,"This movie was worse than a disappointment--it was a frustrating mess of a puzzle that I came to hate watching as it grew more and more complex. The point of the story is finding out what the story is about. About 30 minutes in I no longer cared because it was so incredibly confusing that I had no choice but to give up on it.I could barely hear what the characters were even saying as they casually and all-too briefly brushed over super essential exposition in low monotone voices in between a mindless grind of nonstop moving parts. That went on for the entire movie. Blink and you'll lose track of the plot because it makes no sense in the first place.If you want to just watch something unfold for the heck of it and would rather not spend even a second reflecting on any of it while it happens, this is your movie. In fact, if you prefer zero character development, zero emotion from anyone in screen, and basically zero point to the story other than to crunch through some occasional bizarre action scenes, this will be a gem to you."
40,"This is the very first and last review I will ever leave for a movie.Never did I leave the movie theater so frustrated and confused in my life. I really wanted to like this movie and I usually try to never be too critical of a movie, but there was no part to which I could cling on and say there was something positive and great about it.Even if this movie is deeper and has complex themes which are interesting, your brain shouldn't be overloaded by attempting to comprehend every single second of the movie. It is way too heavy and everything moves way too fast for an effective analysis.The sound and music were waayy to loud to the point that my ears hurt. I literally didn't understand half of what the characters were saying which only worsened the confusion. Subtitles would have been necessary.There is very little backstory to any of the characters, and I didn't care for any of them due to a lack of great acting/ character development. What made Nolan's previous films so great is that it explores the complexity of the characters and their motivations. Here, you're just thrown in the action from the very first second with almost no explanation of each and everyone's purpose in the story.You should at least understand the majority of the concepts after you finish a movie. Here, you'll probably need to re-watch at least another time to start understanding the plot a little bit more. However, I'm not planning to waste another 2.5 hours of my life on this movie.Here's my reccomendation: don't waste your time and money on this film, you'll save hours of life."
41,"I had big expectations for Tenet, since I first watched the trailer. Instead, the movie is very confusing and maybe in order to understand it, I need to watch it more than once. I managed to follow halfway through it, but then I was completely lost. Except the main two characters Neil and The Protagonist, the rest of the cast is pretty flat and Kat is really annoying, especially towards the end. At least actors were good enough to maintain the whole thing afloat.From a technical perspective the movie is good, and there are a few good scenes here and there, but I would say that special effects were cheap and lazy. I mean, from a visionary director such as Nolan I wasn't expecting for sure a bunch of reversed clips. The ending had no sense at all and you cannot actually understand what is happening.If this is the movie that was supposed to relaunch cinemas, after the lockdown period, well, I suggest to look elsewhere. Tenet is unoriginal and uninspired, Nolan already made movies about space and time such as ""Inception"" or ""Interstellar"", so I think that in this case he could have change the topic.A real pity. Movie's definitely too long and there are many stretched out sequences and useless story lines. Instead of deepening some details, which could actually make understand something about what's happening. I suggest to give it a try, but do not expect a masterpiece."
42,"At first sight, this movie was nonsensical and infuriatingly bad. However, since I watched the movie a few days ago, I have carefully reconsidered and re-examined the latest Nolan. I have come to the conclusion that it is easily one of the worst movies ever made, confirming my initial intuition. I tried to find some good but couldn't find any.The dialogue: horrible and cringe.
The sound mixing: ... Oh boy
The acting: yikes
Action: pretty ridiculous and unconvincing
Plot: nonsensical yet somehow still predictableDon't do time travel and try to explain it scientifically. Don't pretend you 'get' this movie, there's nothing to get here. I wish this movie was never made and I wish Nolan could be held accountable for making such trash."
43,"At first, I want to ask Christopher Nolan one question, HOW THE HELL YOU DID THIS?
Seriously I want to have an answer, How did he write such as this masterpiece!
How did he get this complicated, fabulous and creative idea? What is going on in his mind?
The story is written and directed perfectly, the narration style was absolutely unique.
I have no idea how can anyone direct such as this story, that was a huge challenge, and as usual Nolan gave us a masterpiece that we'll put beside (Memento), (Inception) and (Interstellar)
The movie is so fast-paced in a good way, there was no boring moment.
The chemistry between John David Washington and Robert Pattinson was great and funny and both of their performance was really good.
Elizabeth Debicki performance was the best in the movie because she had the chance to show her acting abilities and she cached up that chance and showed us an A level acting.The music wasn't unique and distinct as the music of Interstellar for example and I think this movie needed the touch of Hans Zimmer, I'm not saying that Ludwig Göransson failed but Hans Zimmer in another level.If there was something I'd say that I didn't like it in the movie would it be that Nolan discarded any set up or characters backgrounds except Elizabeth Debicki dramatic story but it wasn't that bad for me, I didn't care about that, the exciting story didn't give me the chance to focus on it.
But the actual problem was the third act, it was really complicated and I got lost and I convinced myself to discard the questions that were in my head and enjoy the well-made action sequences and Elizabeth Debicki performance.I think this kind of movie that gets better with a second and third watch."
44,"One minute he's hard as f..ck and can batter 100 men all at the same time, next minute he's Man handled by 2 geeks n frog marched, this film is terrible I would rather watch my mum hoover her living room floor for 2 hours, do not watch it"
45,"Christopher Nolan is one of the most interesting filmmakers working today. Unlike so many directors who began their careers outside of Hollywood and then moved to Hollywood for mainstream success, Nolan has maintained creative control over his work. Moreover, his interests in the concept of time and the medium of non-linear storytelling have persisted from the smaller movies he cut his teeth on at the start of his career to the big studio flicks he is known for now. It is one thing to make cutting edge movies on a small budget, it is another to transition into making big budget movies that are accessible to the mainstream and it is yet another thing to be able to continue to push your trademark themes and aesthetic sensibilities throughout your diverse body of work. For that Nolan deserves to be commended.Unfortunately, Tenet is a heartless and charmless affair. This may very well be an example of an auteur getting swallowed by their own ego and losing sight of what made their movies great in the first place. Christopher Nolan has made some great movies over the course of his career and a lot of his movies are founded upon unique story-telling components. But the thing about Memento, with its reverse-order narrative, or Inception, with its dream-within-a-dream plot points, is that these story-telling components were just that - devices to tell a story and expand on the characters. For all Inception's plot twists and major action set pieces, the movie was held together by the pathos surrounding Leonardo DiCaprio's character who was grieving for his dead wife and the movie had a resounding message about letting go of the past and living in reality.With Tenet, the story-telling components are gimmicky and, although they come together to tell a complex story, I lost interest around the 90-minute mark. What good is a sophisticated plot if you care nothing for the characters? This movie, like a lot of Nolan movies, is built on one big, speculative concept which requires you to go with it to a large extent. But there is little effort to really make you invested in the characters or the world before that concept is introduced.Early reviews are praising John David Washington's charisma, but I can't say I saw that myself. Washington isn't bad, he does the best with what he's given, but his character (who is known simply as 'The Protagonist') is under-developed. There is also praise coming for Robert Pattinson and I will admit that Pattinson's performance may be the highlight of the movie, but that isn't saying much. Like 'The Protagonist', Pattinson's 'Neil' is a mysterious character without any clear back-story or motivation. A movie could work if one of the two leads were like that - but not both. Perhaps if they made Washington's Protagonist more grounded and relatable, then Neil would work with his wry, Christopher Hitchens-esque, mystique. Alternatively, if they gave Neil a fleshed-out backstory and motivation then he could have served as a focal point for the audience to see the more sublime Protagonist. Instead, both characters are effectively superheroes with ultra-competence but poorly fleshed out development and motivations.Reviewers will undoubtedly note the action sequences and the special effects of this movie - which are impressive - though I feel that Nolan could have heeded the 'less is more' principle a bit more. By the end of the movie I was so worn out with the action and trying to keep up with it, that I was no longer impressed by the visuals. Instead of staging these complex action scenes, greater emotion could have gone into them to get us to feel the stakes. Then again, what are stakes when you care nothing for the characters?"
46,"To all the fans out there: please, don't downvote my review just 'cause I dared to give a 6-grade to a movie directed by Nolan. Read it first, thank you very much.OK, so, what is there to say about this ""Tenet""? Well, first and foremost, lemme tell you that the movie isn't ""bad"" in any way, shape or form. In a blockbuster world populated by ""Avengers"", ""Transformers"", awful Disney animated classics' remakes and the likes, you can't seriously go around sayin' that ""Tenet"" is bad entertainment without being scorned. It's definitely passable entertainment.But its director is really, really sly, and being such he managed to convince a lot of people (and especially a lot of critics) out there that he created a very profound and complicated movie, when in fact he did not. 'Cause ""Tenet"" is pretty much a Bond movie going backwards half of the time. The plot is really that simple and predictable - half an hour into it and you'd already grasp pretty much everything there is to grasp. I'm not being arrogant here, please believe me: go watch the movie and you'll realize that yourself. Guaranteed. Now that we have put that aside, I'll go on by laying everything out plain and simple:PROS:Great direction. That's a given: Nolan knows how to put the camera to best use and knows how to keep you hooked most of the time;Effective soundtrack. It's not by any chance memorable, but it nonetheless contributes a lot to the movie's overall atmosphere;Dark cinematography. Again, very effective and in line with the movie' ""serious"" tone;A couple of great action sequences. And the ""backwards special effects"" are really a treat to behold.
CONS:Mediocre dialogues and screenplay. I mean, a lot of times the dialogues are either cringeworthy or purely explanatory (and the bad guy has the worst lines of them all). On top of that, the screenplay tries the best to conceal its simple narrative, but can't quite manage to convince you that it's phenomenal and brilliant, or that in the end it's isn't just a matter of a banal spy story. And - by the way - the overall theme is too close to blatant fatalism for me to like.Cardboard characters. Every single one of them is a total ""spy movie"" cliché: from the ""Protagonist"" to the ridiculous villain. They're completely underdeveloped and so there's no chance that the viewers can indentify with them.Unconvincing main actor. Of course he's isn't on par with his father Denzel - but that's obvious. The problem is that he also isn't on par neither with Pattison nor especially with Branagh. Really a bad casting choice over here.Lack of pathos. You're not gonna feel any empathy towards the characters ('cause, as I said, they're not actually characters: they are puppets, cardboard puppets with no interesting personalities). Nolan himself doesn't seem to care about that, lost as he is in his ""entropy gimmick"".
Here you go. In conclusion - to sum it up - I'd say that ""Tenet"" is definitely a movie to be seen on the biggest screen possible. It's a decent blockbuster full of every kind of action and vaguely intriguing in its premise. It's also - however - let down by a predictable storyline and mediocre dialogues. It lacks pathos and presents us with a main actor who is not really that good. But at the very least Nolan with this new movie is trying to do something different from the majority of other big budget productions and we gotta hand it to him. Anyway, his movie isn't by any standard a great one.
That's all I had to say. So long folks, and may the ""Sator square"" be with you!"
47,"It's a really good film, however, it's overly complex and the sound mixing is awful, you can't hear half of the dialogue."
48,"I wish I could give this a better rating, but when only half the dialogue is audible it's impossible to follow the plot. Left confused and disappointed. Will have to wait for subtitles to watch again. As released with the horrendous audio mix, it's a 5."
49,"I felt like this movie was giving me the finger the entire time - saying ha ha you'll watch anything won't you! None of the dialog makes any sense, the acting from the leads is terrible, the music is awful and the sound of gunfire pierces your ears and you often can't make out what anybody is saying half the time. The characters are all awful people. What made anybody think anyone would want to watch this? The strangest thing is some people are saying this is a masterpiece of cinema, which I don't understand."
50,"Movies are about creating an experience for a viewer, to create feelings, whether positive or negative. In order to do that, you need to have some understanding of whats happening, and you need to care about the characters. In this movie, I had no idea what the story was about, and what the characters wanted.I love, I loved inception despite its flaws. This movie has all of inceptions flaws made into the main course. It's almost as if the movie outright hates its audience. Even in inception, with its lack of human characters, you still kinda cared for Cobb. When he reunites with his kids, you feel lit, and you understand his motivation. In this movie, you have none of this.I've seen bad movies, but this movie fails on the basic foundations of what a movie needs to be, to be entertaining and valuable. I almost fell asleep a few times"
51,"I love psychological questioning movies. Particularly Nolans movies. But wth was this?! And it's not like I'm slow at picking storylines up. I'm a clinician with a masters. It's been put together to deliberately have you in a state of confusion, I suspect like the protagonist, with the anticipation of it all clicking together half way and you sit back in your seat thinking 'woooaaahhhh!' But it just leaves you confused thinking where the hell are the filmmakers going? Instead you end up critiquing each aspect of the filmmaking and miss out on enjoying the movie. Not that there was anything to enjoy. I get the movie but it just felt...stupid.The soundmixing. I mean nobody could hear any sentences bar 5% from each one. If there was ever an example to show sound engineers how not to put sound mixing together, this was it. 50 times worse than the first 10 mins of dark knight rises.Acting - Pattinson holds it well as you'd expect, but wasted because of the freaking music constantly being played when he spoke. The protagonist, this dude has no facial expressions. Coming from BAME background I'm really annoyed that not a better actor or actress was used who could pull me into each of their scenes or just even make it a bit more of an interesting watch. Someone who could show fear, anger, worry etc. Lupita Nyong'o? Thandie newton. Oh and I'm male btw and not a feminist.I'm going to do the home covid test now. But if I end up testing positive, I'm seriously going to be incensed at getting it after risking my 1st cinema outing in 6 months on such an abysmal movie."
52,"Greetings from Lithuania.I just came back from a premiere of ""Tenet"" (2020), a hugely anticipated new movie by Mr. Christopher Nolan - my favorite director. I'm a huge Nolan's fan, saw all his movie in a theater and they all left me speechless and i even consider ""Interstellar"" as my favorite film of this millennium - i'm a real Nolan's fan boy.And with my broken heart i can only say after seeing ""Tenet"" that it was a first real disappointment by this brilliant director. This time Mr. Nolan has outdone himself, and not in a good way. Story and plot were a mess. Its not ""Inception"" by any means - that movie had a very simple idea and plot which was put into this intriguing world and concept - it wasn't difficult to follow because you always knew exactly what was the goal, who is who and etc. ""Tenet"" does not had any of that. While i enjoyed the plot for a around first 40% of its run time, later its just become so convoluted that farther it went the more i was scratching my head and eventually started to rolling my eyes when Robert Pattinson's and John David Washington's characters were describing the plot to each other, jumping for and between, reading between the lines and etc - it was simply way to complicated and eventually convoluted. By the end of this movie i really didn't care what was going on nor did i tried to understand - the movie's plot and storytelling lost me completely. Its not Nolan ""the director"" who wasn't good here, but its Noland ""the screenwriter"" who i think overdone himself this time, and not in a good way. The good things in this movie were for me performance by Kenneth Branagh who was excellent villain, cinematography and basically all the production values in this movie - they are first rate. Unfortunately plot and storytelling were below average - they just didn't for me at all.Overall, unfortunately the year 2020 was a terrible year not only because of the virus, but also it was a year when we got a first flop from Mr. Nolan. Its not that its a bad movie, like i said production values are first rate but other then that you will be scratching your head in disbelieve of how convoluted and cold this movie is. For his next feature Mr. Nolan should slow it down with plot and maybe take his brother as writer to help - together they can put plots and screenplays like no other. ""Tenet"" unfortunately is not the case."
53,"It is one thing for a film to have a complex narrative structure and another for it to be a convoluted mess. And Tenet is unfortunately the latter. A high-concept, sci-fi mind-bender with a premise that packed just the right kind of intrigue, potential & promise, it really is a shame that the execution is so incoherent & all over the place that even after one connects all the dots, there is no rewarding feeling or sense of gratification waiting in the end.Written & directed by Christopher Nolan, once again he comes up with an original & seemingly ingenious idea but fails to construct an emotionally fulfilling plot around it. Though his attempt to dismantle & reassemble the same series of events to provide added context & new perspective is admirable, the plot still lacks the smooth flow & cohesiveness that can not only elevate & enrich a cinematic experience like this but also make the journey thoroughly satisfying & worthwhile.The sci-fi mechanics at play here are interesting to say the least but the characters remain cold & distant throughout the film, their persona & interplay lacking depth & connection to such an extent that not even the film's end-of-the-world shtick is able to make us care. The inversion segments sure look cool & disorienting but they still don't make up for the glaring problems in the screenplay. And then, things get even worse when some of the technical aspects are taken into consideration.Performances from the cast is good but there are no standouts. Robert Pattinson is the only one who tries to make his role count while others just play along as per the scene requirements with surface-level emotions. Editing is a mixed bag, captivating & confusing in equal measure, and is unable to make all elements work together in harmony. Ludwig Göransson's score has no idea how to keep up with the unfolding set of events. Messy & muddled, it neither exhibits a structural flow nor any sensory thrills.Overall, Tenet is an audacious effort by all means but it also falls short of living up to its own lofty ambitions and is an inconsistent ride that's marred by issues of its own makings. Nolan finally bites off more than he can chew, making Tenet one of his least impressive entries. Still, for what it's worth, this cerebral delight piqued my curiosity enough to warrant another viewing. But as per first impressions, Christopher Nolan's latest is a disjointed & disappointing mess that effectively showcases his best & worst tendencies as a filmmaker."
54,"Being a huge Nolan fan I anticipated this release. I think everyone of his films (exluding the mediocre third batman) is a masterpiece. Unfortunately this time he got everything wrong. First of all the script, though based on an interesting idea, is all over the place. Nothing is explained or completed. I struggled for the first hour to understand what is happening and then I stopped caring. And that brings us to the second fault. There are no characters, only puppets with no backstory or evolvment arc, muttering Nolan's ideas like ""text to voice"" wikipedia. The music is very annoying, most of the time covering the actors voices. The actors try to do their best with what the were given which is not much. Well...with the exception of the completely talentless protagonist. Hope this mess is the only low point in Nolan's filmography."
55,I would love to be able to give an opinion on this movie but unfortunately the background music was so loud that I couldn't make out a word the characters were saying. The beginning scene triggered my anxiety as I wasn't expecting that level of noise. No idea what this movie was about.
56,"I have only seen this once, and have no plans to see it again to 'understand' it better.The dialogue is so muffled, I could barely understand a word anyone said. Michael Caine had one scene and he had to talk with food in his mouth for the entire scene. It was a deliberate directors choice to garble all words.Not just in that scene, but in all of them. When they were having a conversation, they had removed all the structure words (the, and, a) and just had a ""baby talk"" conversation using long scientific terms that they didn't understand themselves.If a conversation ever started to make sense, he would cover it with loud music and aeroplane noises. So loud, I literally had to cover my ears it was hurting.The mix was dreadful. One moment it was super loud, then the very next they were mumbling in whispers. I never experienced such a bad sound mix as this.As for the plot? Again, it makes no sense. Gunshot wounds don't ""heal"" in reverse time. You cant just make up nonsense stupid plot devises, that make no sense if they have three hours to get to a hospital. THREE HOURS!There is more, but this film is so bad I have better things to do."
57,"I originally rated it 7 and thought I would like it more on a second watch... And after all the hype i had faded i did... And man I realized it's a horrible boring movie, cringy villain with cringy female character who does everything without any point other than to move the plot forward, the main idea gets dull pretty quickly and pretty impossible to understand fully.. Man after i liberated from all the hype i had the first time i realized how ridiculous and boring this soap opera was... I actually got mad that this was a freaking Nolan film.. The only guy I wait for his movies along with Tarantino... I'm so so so disappointed...
(edit) : if you guys don't believe me.. Let me tell somethings about the movie....
"" nuclear holocaust?...-worst"".....omg.. What?... ""if i can't have you no one will.""...cringing bad... "" i will do anything for my son""... Including killing the guy and causing the end of freakin humanity.... "" don't try to understand it""... Well there you go... Nolan says f you to your face....
Omg this movie is so bad... I can't blame the actors they kinda carried the whole thing and John David Washington would make a good James Bond.. They had to deal with immensely bad writing, script and characters... Nolan did a pretty bad job and made this movie for his own amusement and be we like him we hyped to it... An identical thing happened with Tarantino and once upon a time in Hollywood.. My two favorite movie makers went nuts"
58,"Two stars because it was at least entertaining. A ""masterpiece"" though? How pretentious can you get? This is no masterpiece. The problem I had with it, was they had this really cool idea about time, and how people can move forward or backward through it for some nefarious purpose, then they muddied it up with a story they never explained, and kept going without ever connecting the dots. The grand moral at the end was ""a mother's love is stronger than anything, and she'll do whatever she has to to be with her son."" Like was that why this movie exists?!?!? This is a masterpiece?!? Grow up.I started getting pissed when the characters had to construct this elaborate plan to break into that high-security vault to steal the drawing. The heist was actually interesting and there was action present. Afterall that drawing (for no legitimate or logical reason) was forcing the girl to be a slave to her abusive husband. So protagonist and Neil construct this plan and go into the vault, dodging the suffocation gas that puts out fires, ultimately finding future protagonist and scuffle. And that's it.However long later, girl is on cloud nine cause protagonist stole the drawing. But he didn't really; he lied, for some reason?!? Girl finds out that he lied because abusive husband serves her the drawing on a silver breakfast platter. So here we are, an elaborate heist, a failed mission, a lie saying they succeeded, but no clear reason as to why any of that mattered or why protagonist would lie to her. And back to the drawing... how can a shiiiitteee piece of paper of two people hugging (or something) force girl to be a slave?!!!!?Again. This is no masterpiece. You're not interesting, enlightened, or an intellectual for using that word. You appear the opposite because ""having to use my brain"" does not make it a good movie. If anything, your brain swindled you by creating a fantasy or an explanation of this film that is incorrect. It was entirely incoherent, and while it had a cool premise, it failed completely. I might watch it again so I can at least remember character names when I go to talk badly about it. After 2.5 hours of watching four characters spin in circles around each other, the only memorable name was Neil. Goes to show how poorly these characters were written and developed. Totally unmemorable. Pass."
59,What a barely coherent mess. Plot is so weak and all characters one dimensional. The director just wanted to showcase us how technically cool he is with mixed timelines. Bravo!
60,Anyone not ready to walk out on the hour point deserves some sort of medal for gallantry or endurance... It is utter crap
61,"Wow. Seriously, just came back from a viewing of this & can tell for 2 hours & 24 minutes I never understood a single bit of this film, that's how much of a mess it was. Hell I can't even explain the synopsis never mind what the film is about it's that bad.Typically this film has got good ratings! Pfft, paid reviewers at it again while the GP takes a back seat in the dark. The fake reviews get catapulted into the public eye while the GP ones only get seen here. Pathetic. How about explaining how the film was like it is? Why lie & say it was good when it wasn't. I can tell you now you'd have to be a Grade A tip top geniuses or have a Masters Degree in confusing plots of films to even understand a gist of this never mind the whole plot. How ANYONE can understand this tripe is beyond me.The plot makes no sense. It was like following a moving trains traveling in a Mobius infinity loop. It's simply impossible when there's is no obvious concise narrative as to what's what. What time they are, in what day it is etc. The plot was a mess & as if that wasn't bad enough you have the time travel crap mixed in, literally. There would be a scene where you were following the action then BAM! ""Something"" already happened & then the whole reversing of what already happened would occur then just fade off into nowhere, then later on you see the same scene this time from a different perspective where what happened is in forward motion & what was in forward motion would be in reverse in the background. Then when you'd see the scene from another perspective it turns out to be the same characters!? Eh!? I know it's suppose to be the alternate dimension but When? Where? How? & What? Even typing this out now makes my head ache with frustration!You'd understand (understand being a strongly stressed word in this case) the plot sort of then the rug would be pulled from beneath your feet when a ""This already happened"" scene would occur, cue more confusing time travel crap. Several scenes in the film would show ships, car going in reverse & it wouldn't be made clear what or when this was happening!The films dialogue was hard to get & understand. The muffled sound, over dramatic music & explosions didn't help. Like with the plot & narrative, the dialogue could've been more concise & easily translated to the audience.The characters were ok, the action was ok. But sadly the films confusing plot, muddle time travel scenes made it harder. This film really sucked hard & is typically overrated. Doesn't the writer & director understand that the film has to be made easy to follow? That's is the whole point in going to see a film correct? I've said it before & I'll say it again! MAKE THE FILM EASIER TO FOLLOW FOR CASUAL AUDIENCES! I mean seriously, not EVERYONE watching this film will be fans of your work! The films pacing & run time were ridiculous & only a secondary insult to injury problem with the film.Overall, DON'T waste you time with this crap. Take it from me a film goer who by the way notice beside him a group of lads laughing & raising their hands much like I did & thinking ""wtf"" every 5 minutes! The plot & narrative makes 0 sense. It's only muddier further with the time travel & plot points which frustrates you more with the film pacing & run time. By the time I got to 1 hour & 30 minutes, I gave up & the film felt like an absolute chore to watch from that point on! 1/10"
62,"If you're looking for a nice movie to go out and enjoy, pass on this one. I don't know why it was made so unnecessarily difficult. I literally got a headache watching this. I get it was time travel and the overall general plot, but why did they have to make everything so vague. This is not a movie, this is a puzzle AND YOU BEST BET THAT NOBODY HAS TIME FOR THAT!! HARD PASS.
I'll give it 4 for the effort and the good quality cinematography"
63,"This movie is in short, way too long, way too complicated, to the point where i left an everyman cinema. Its tried to be too clever for its own good, and the plots are plentiful but not explained as the movie moves through so many.
The fight scenes are awful.
The acting is at best average, and some of the dialogues are just garbage and childish nonsense.
Paid 15 quid at the everyman cinema, best bit was the icecream sunday i ordered."
64,"I'm speechless!
I don't know what to feel after I watch this movie..
The cinematography, the story, the score - everything about this movie is finesse at it's finest!
Definitely a must watch!"
65,"Most people will feel dumb that this movie confuses them: but the reality is that the movie itself is dumb: in the sense that by design it frustrates the user with a premise that is not inherently hard to understand but it is extremely hard to enjoy. In my experience I had little difficulty understanding the mechanics of the story - mainly because I'm a die hard science fiction fan and a literal scientist - but I felt that while the story was mildly original the core of it was mostly an exercise in mental gymnastics for a concept that didn't progress much and it could have been only one small part of the story and not the entire thing because at the end of it I felt like I watched an entire 3 hour long thing that was mainly a ""look at me: I think I brought up a confusing concept"" (which wasn't that much really) so this story should have concentrated more on making an interesting story rather than a self-congratulating repetition of a concept that was clearly explain with exposition on the first few minutes (also the Direction was mostly soul-less since it felt like mostly created by committee)."
66,"I have felt ripped off by this movie. I thought that being from Nolan would be fine, but its not a viewer friendly. It expels it from the film by introducing the science fiction element, which in addition to making the whole plot incomprehensible is ridiculous. We have always associated the forward scenes with movies or series of laughter. Nolan tries to build a James Bond movie with a science fiction element so the experiment doesn't work at all. Kenneth Branagh's role borders on ridiculous composing a comic book villain character.
To make matters worse, we have to swallow the same idiotic scenes twice, backwards and forwards.
It's not worth paying what a movie ticket is worth today to see this mess."
67,"John David Washington? Aside from the laughable name, he is in fact just aterrble actor, bordering on unwatchable. Every scene he is in seems fake and contrived. For me, it was impossible to relate to his character. he is tracking down the reason all sorts of strange trash is showing up from the so-called future. Most of this tedious and sloppy film is not about this. It is a collection of boring people wearing expensive clothing posturing, hiding and fighting about who knows what. Usually a review tells a bit about the plot, the actors, the director, possibly the photography. There is none of that in this film. The acting is utterly bad. the director is clueless in the extreme, the photography is forgetaable, to many wide angle lenses for example and the plot is absurd. Given the millions who voted for Donald Trump, we now now beyond a doubt that tens of millions of people are just to stupid to know where the sky is or how to lace their shoes. Never trst the judgement of anyone who gives this foolish and useless film more than a solid ""1"". Preserve your humanity and avoid it."
68,"Had high expectations but the movie is long and boring. It had such an confusing plot that tricks you into thinking the movie is ""actually good"". Had few good visual scenes, not compelling enough to make it up for the one fifty minutes. Went to see John and Robert in a film, assumed it has to be great despite what's being seen on the screen. It's quite slow paced, nor suspenseful and hated the sound mixing, too loud, especially in the action scenes, unable to see the movie due to that is just unforgivable.People are giving 10/10 ratings and praises, ignoring the plotholes and obvious flaws cause directed by Nolan. Think they're doing him a favour but we have to call out such things, else we keep gonna get mediocre movies. I'm sure because of blind fanaticism, same people not gonna find my review helpful, either. Original rating is 4/10, giving it 1 for balancing the high rating."
69,"Ignore the fake 9/10 and 10/10 reviews most likely coming from the actors. Tenet is a complete and utterly nonsense.1) ridiculous plot;
2) impossible to follow, but not because of some complexity of the plot (it is quite simple) but because the plot is empty;
3) no character development;
4) boring dialogues;
5) actors obviously confused about what exactly they are playing, which makes it all even worse.Not worth watching even once. Better to rewatch some movie you actually like."
70,"*** POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD ***Ok, I don't review many titles, but I feel the need to address this self-agrandizing Nolan 'epic' for what it is. And that is, a quasi-scientific bunch of hooey about a topic that clearly neither Nolan nor his target audience know much about. Having studied time, causality, quantum mechanics, GR/SR & a number of other time-related branches of physics, I have to say, I was quite under-whelmed by this one-trick pony. So much that I found it almost as annoying as Memento, or Matrix 2 & 3, a couple other one-trickers. Before you jump to conclusions, yes, I got it, I understood what it was all about, while piecing together the barely-heard conversations & expositions at several points in the film - turn down the effing music Nolan - I can listen to classical music any time I want without having to strain to hear someone bloody well speaking about major plot points!The main issue I have with Tenet is that it's all sci-fi nonsense & barely good sci-fi at that, mostly fantasy actually. Real physics aside, it just wasn't entertaining once you get the 'trick'. It just tried too hard to pander to neo-intelletuals with quasi-science causality mini-loops splattered throughout. Not to mention the motivations of the main bad guy are non-sensical, except for a completely insane psycopath who somehow manages to keep everyone loyal around him in the dark...because if they even had an inkling of what he wanted to achieve, why in God's name would anyone NOT completely insane ever help the maniac??? It's patently absurd & ridiculous with a number of glaring inconsistencies & plot holes that most will just gloss over. Even as pure entertainment I felt that my intelligence was being insulted, and I'm certainly no genius-level intellect! I can only imagine how all the poor career physicists must feel out there, to see their life's work assaulted by Hollywood like this yet again...In the end, it's about as satifying as invert sugar (pun intended). Watch at your own risk if you have 2.5 hrs to kill you definitely won't want back on your death bed. For the rest of you with some sense, I recommend you watch Primer instead if you want a more 'realistic' foray into time & causality loops, without the big budget, car chases & CGI explosions. You have been warned. 6/10 (mostly for Caine, Pattinson & the scenery)"
71,"I don't want to spoil anything and because im pretty mad that I paid to watch this trash here it is.
Nolan is my favourite director, but in my opinion this movie is trash. It is trying so hard to be ""smart"", that is losing its point. For me, the main ""thing"" of the movie was obvious from the first 20 minutes. Also, there are insane plot holes (ex. oxygen, won't say more to not spoil anything). The scenes as well as the dialogue were ""trying so hard"" that it was getting confusing all the time.
When you try to innovate, sometimes you fail.
His worst movie. Period."
72,"I waited all year for this movie. I talked it up to everybody. Oh well. I dont know where to begin about how bad this is... its just baaaaaddddd!!!! It looks good of course because of the budget but thats it. Atrocious casting, even worse acting, a script from a rejected SyFy movie, and a nonsensical plot based in fantasy without a shred of science. Its actually embarrassing to watch. I cringed and then laughed and then cringed and then laughed. If this is considered a good movie today then God help us all. I do say watch it though and judge for yourself. And then lie how great it was so you can be politically correct...or whatever. As for me I call a spade a spade and this movie sucks."
73,"If you don't understand a movie and have a feeling that it is good then instead of giving low rates, why don't you watch it again and try to understand more?Satoshi Kon says: ""Movies that you can watch once and understand entirely -- that is the type of movie that I don't really like. However, if you are able to understand 70 to 80 percent of what's being relayed, and there's still some percentage left that would allow for your own interpretation . . . that's the type of movie that I do like. There might be a certain part that you don't quite understand, but there is a portion that rests in your heart.""It is a shame that the audience profile has been changing and this movie will get a lower rating ratio than it deserves.Note: I really understand the bad reviews based on the sound problems. I have watched it three times in three different theaters. The first had no problem with the sound, the second had a problem which is very small and the third one had a very bad sound problem. My point is that probably some of the theaters didn't test the sound because the sound should be lowered. It is not because of the movie since I watched once with no problem. Actually, it is a problem for some theaters. They need to decrease the level of the sound probably the decibel level is too high for their speakers.Additionally, I understood the movie during the first watch. The problem is that nowadays watchers are not careful anymore. All the clues are there! You just don't wanna see."
74,"I love MOST Christopher Nolan movies, but Tenet was bad. Really bad. It made about as much sense as a Joe Biden speech. The action sequences were just ok. The music was 112 decibels louder than the speech, which was muffled 75% of the time by a mask. The dialogue was like trying to understand the crazy brother portrayed by Tom Hardy in Legend, while the crazy brother was wearing scuba gear.It was not thought provoking like Inception, as the only thought I had was ""When will this be over?"" And ""Why isn't that weird vampire guy sparkling in this movie?"".Please, please, please don't turn Christopher Nolan into another Quentin Tarantino, where you give his movies 10 stars regardless of how bad it is. Your blind, sheeplike reviews just cost me $90 at the theater."
75,"This movie isnt a good movie, a good movie would engage with its audience, have a coherent plot and make you cheer on your favourite characters.This movie has none of that and no amount of Hans Zimmer copycat music or flashy visual effects can make up for the lifelessness of the film."
76,"Sadly I couldn't understand or hear the dialogue, and I could not follow the interminable plot. Far too long, I was just waiting to be able to leave. Some beautiful photography, but a lacklustre cast. Give it a miss."
77,"While the rest of the world is at its knees, Australia is doing well enough to have half compacity cinemas, which means I get the pleasure of watching Tenet a week before most of the world.As a self-confessed fanboy of Nolan and his films I came into the cinema busting at the seems with excitement and expectation, I was not let down in the slightest.Tenet's first half has the viewer scrambling their brains trying to comprehend what is happening, from exotic scene to the next your senses are bombarded left and right. It isn't until the second half of the film that it all becomes clear and you understand the true brilliance of what Nolan and his crew have put to the screen.Its hard to keep this review spoiler free because everything about the plot has been hidden and so little has been shown in trailers. While I am not claiming this is the greatest film ever made it certainly is an adequate distraction from the current situation the human race finds itself in.I highly recommend viewing this film in theatres at least once, (even though it will probably take you 2 or 3 viewings to fully grasp all the intricacies like it has for me); I feel like the full experience will be missed if your first viewing is at home like many Nolan films before it.KidKuubrick."
78,"An unexpected work from Christopher Nolan
Well Christopher Nolan is undoubtedly one of the best directors, but Tenet is a big problem!
At first I'm not even sure how to write a review about this movie! Complex, strange and annoying at times, and I cannot even tell if the scenario is smart or is it just complicated?
On the positive side, the acting was perfect, especially in terms of Robert. And his acting is perfect. This is clearly his best movie ever.
There are other features such as music, photography, etc. However, the movie does not match the rest of the great Nolan films, but it is not bad so I will rate it 8 out of 10."
79,"Clémence Poésy character says in the film ""Don't try to understand it. Feel it."" And later Pattinson character ask to the main character ""Does your head hurt yet?"" While he is trying to explain part of the plot to The Protagonist and to us as an audience, this is basically the whole movie, visually is great, the score even being loud is also great, the concept of moving backwards is also a great idea that give a lot great scenes, but when you stop to realize, a lot of things don't make a lot of sense."
80,Best comback of Christopher Nolan after Dunkirk . It's marvelous. The fresh inversion concept is simply outstanding. The performances are great. John David Washington is excellent and Robert Pattinson is cool minded done a mature performance and rest of the cast have done a superb job. The cinematography is super. Some scenes are simply breath taking. It's a visual treat. Th action is also very good.
81,"This movie was so pretentious, Chris Nolan has lost it - left half way through the music going backwards give me a sore head. Don't waste your time going to this."
82,"Although I did not pay a dime to see this nonsense, I still feel I should be paid for my time wasted on watching this garbage. My god, another poor idiots deep film by Chris Convolutions Nolan.I imagine people who like this vapid trash coming out of the theatre, having their puny minds blown and going ""Whoa!!!"" with a Keanu Reeves accent, not realizing they have not remembered a single plot point of this flaccid cash grab.First of all, the main protagonist is a massive Gary Stu and the actor is a wooden as they get with his dead-pan dialogue. Also the audio is really bad. Also Nolans casual use of random incoherent mystical symbolisms is obvious, childish and tiring, spray-painting meaningless references to the sator-square everywhere like a chump. It is loathsomely void and dumb.The whole plot gimmick falls apart as soon as you actually have a think about it. Entropy and time are NOT THE SAME THING!!!! It simply does not work. But it works SO badly that it is used in every way possible. It has no actual rules, so it just is a free-for-all McGuffin for Nolan to wind around and around the waver thin plot in a desperate attempt to obfuscate and convolute the script to the point where paying attention starts to hurt and, for most people, lazy complacency takes over and they just absorb the spectacle of it without thinking.Unfortunately one can not blame obvious frauds like Nolan for his success. After all, if the public was not so hungry for empty meaningless escapism without substance, guys like that would be doing some horrid office job, not raping culture with their feeble media chud.It is a bad and forgettable movie. It offers nothing of value or interest and in a perfect world, it would have never even been considered worth considering. Alas, it is obviously not a perfect world, but if you IQ is higher than your shoe size, don't bother with this dilapidated nonsense."
83,I am shocked at how low a critics score it has. I have seen the movie twice and it's an amazing experience. I think if shall we say more movie fans went to see this movie it would be 8.7 or 8.6 at least.
84,"The scheme of the film was more or less the same: mission, dialogue, mission, dialogue, mission... (or first dialogue then mission...). However, the dialogues were so meaningless that they were of no use except for time consumption. They didn't really get you anywhere, they were too empty and flat for that. The missions on the other hand were quite strange for me. Mission: I want to break into a warehouse. What to do (and what is most complicated?). I hijack a plane of the tax authorities (?), which is transporting tons of gold, and race into the warehouse. Does that make sense? No, not really, but it makes action. And the best thing is, in the movie it's no problem, no difficulties, stupid guards, no obstacles. Capturing an airplane, that's something I can do. The main thing is a few nice effects.
When things got tight, there was always a door opening somewhere (example ship: door to the engine room...). It was a bit like having an unemotional artist on a wire rope, secured with a thick rope and you know exactly that when he falls nothing happens to him. There was just no tension. Also, to break the circle by simply cutting the safety line in the film, that was probably too much to ask. The film could not offer that.
What was it like in the movie? The secret agent had just stolen the plutonium. The oligarch comes along in another car and brings his wife with him. There is a car chase on the highway until both vehicles are speeding along side by side. What does the oligarch do? He says I would like the plutonium (which is actually part of a secret code / algorithm), otherwise I will kill the woman I brought with me. And what does the secret agent do (it's all about humanity), oh yes, no problem here it is (o.k. in reality the suitcase was empty, but so what). How he then stops the other car (it is speeding towards the end of a traffic jam), you have to have seen - and if you are honest with yourself, you would have to leave the cinema afterwards. What would Lt. Col. Devoe have done in this situation? - and it was all about a few cheap nuclear missiles.
The story itself is even more challenging for me. In the future, a scientist invents a way to travel back in time. She realizes that the invention might not be that good after all, she splits it into 9 parts (the codes / algorithms), sends it back in time and the goal is to find the parts again and unite them so that the world can end. And this is on the initiative of the future population, which holds the current population responsible for the exploitation of the world and for all environmental damage. Aha. But somehow this is not unknown to me, so somehow between Terminator, a quota scientist (wasn't there a scientist responsible for the quantum weapon in Mortal Engines too?) and Aquaman, where the underwater inhabitants wanted to defend themselves against the destruction of the environment, to name a few current ones,... I don't want to talk about the splitting into 9 fragments or parts (Infinity stones, various mummy movies etc.). Wouldn't it have been easier to destroy the thing right in the future?
I have already mentioned the rather emotionless behaviour of the main character several times. In contrast, the super agent James Bond is a universe of character. You have to keep in mind that the movie cost almost a quarter of a billion dollars, but it is also a Nolan movie. Mother/son - secret agent - villain and a little bit of end of the world. Somehow I can think of comparisons with certain ""low budget"" movies with a similar setting, ""Reset"", a Chinese film with mother/daughter and time loop from 2017. A typical Chinese film, with pathos, exaggeration. IMDb somewhere around 5. If you ignore the first 5 minutes and watch the next 30, it was somehow more coherent in the plot than tenet and (at least in the time I watched it - o.k. I watched it completely) picked me up emotionally better. Even though the main actress suddenly has no problem handling a pistol. Whereby, tenet has also shown that an art historian makes a good assassin (don't get the idea that this is not realistic!). Or even mother/daughter in ""Hai Phuong"", 2019, Vietnam, especially the last half hour has carried me away more than tenet did. It is all about emotions! And, to exaggerate if you like musicals, I found Rocky Handsome, 2016, somehow more impressive (even if he didn't get the best reviews), this time not mother/daughter, but ""father""/daughter and a remake at the same time. What I wanted to say with the examples, there are other filmmakers who are not the highly praised ""masterminds"", who at least in a small way, make films that are interesting for me (and they don't have to be available in E). And yes, I was unfair to the films with ""cheap (low budget) home movies"" - I liked them.
But back to tenet. What exactly the codes / algorithms were and what they could do remained in the dark. I could have said heretical now, since the film would have had to explain something. Also the story (actually a side story) with the 12 million painting (which felt like ¼ of the film) remained rather unclear for me, since it did not advance the story from my point of view. The other actors also remained rather pale for me. They had no background story and therefore no ""life"", one could just as well have used wooden figures, they were just there.
Actually the end scene could have been a highlight. With forward/backward actions. In a deserted former Russian secret town. But for me it was not. The city looked very different from the way you know Russian cities from documentaries (Oil-City was even more tangible, lovingly and real for me), on the other hand the soldiers ran for miles on open space, and there were also soldiers from the enemy, although a bomb was supposed to explode in a few minutes. The fights themselves were difficult for me to describe as such. In another recession, they were compared to paintball games, and yes, that's what I like best. It had more of a game character than a real fight.
And then, just before the end, the bad guy (or one of his employees) almost wins, just one more push of a button - and what happens, the thing jams, not just once or twice. This of course gives the hero the opportunity to turn the whole thing around! How nice. That was a real low point in the film for me. I'm sorry, for a film with the resume and the budget these are things I can't forgive. That was just weak for me.
The running gag, ""who recruited you?"", fitted for me to the level of the film (in the sense of an innovative story) - ""who is Sophie Neveu?"", for me it wasn't funny, but at best it was a copy of another film - and by the way, he, the protagonist, will play an important role in the future, he just doesn't know it yet. Have you ever heard it somewhere else?
Some topics were just illogical for me. The film represented the thesis, or rather showed that the ""grandfather paradox"" doesn't exist, i.e. you could erase yourself or your ancestor and didn't have to worry about yourself (unless you meet yourself in the past, then that's not good - with exceptions, fighting against yourself is possible). This means that you can create infinite clones of yourself or the algorithm components with the ""back machines"" that seem to be standing around every street corner (both the bad guy and the ""good"" secret organization had some). With a little thought, this could have made the whole thing much easier. And actually, ""Dark"" with its inner logic and the motivations of the actors (including their emotions) seems to me almost like a revelation in comparison. Also it was not so clear to me, why the future population wanted to completely wipe out the current one, wouldn't targeted interventions in history be more effective?
So what is my conclusion?
A brief summary of the history: Evil Russian oligarch with a difficult childhood and a psychotic woman who wants to kill him has the desire to destroy the world because he himself is terminally ill and therefore cannot own the world, or if he is dead, no one else should live either (yes, it is really as outrageous as it sounds). Fortunately, there is a good western (quota) black secret agent, who prevents this almost single-handedly. Actually a pearl of storytelling, because it has already proven itself a hundred times in other films. That would probably be too much copy, so we take a ""time-back machine"", even if it has no real use and it's not explained, but it's different then and gives some nice effects. When I think of how many highly paid and creative screenwriters have probably been involved. It probably would have been better to have spent 3-4 thousand dollars more on a decent script, but with all the action, you didn't have any money left.
The story has considerable logic holes for me, the motivation and the character drawing of the villain is not comprehensible or mature at all for me. The story itself has for me one or the other (rather more than less) borrowings from other films and, in order not to make it too difficult for the secret agent, many coincidences that prevent the worst from happening. For me, that is simply far too little for a film with these boundary conditions. Even for an Asylum film (if it had received a production release with the setting at all) it would not even be mediocre for me. Therefore 3 out of 10 .
Nevertheless it is currently the only block fruster. So go to the cinema, if necessary with a sleep mask and earplugs, but go!"
85,"Not as much action in the beginning, the time traveling stuff kinda confused me, I understood it basically but felt like I really had to pay extra attention to this movie, I know I'd probably like it better a second time that's why the rating it so high. The main character has a couple of REALLY bad jokes, that's my main complaint with this movie. The time traveling stuff is cool it just takes a while to get there"
86,"No spoilers, but the dangly bit is important.The first time I watched Tenet, I noticed the dangly bit once, understood half the plot, and rated the film at six out of ten.The second time I watched Tenet, I noticed the dangly bit twice, understood two thirds of the plot, and rated the film at seven out of ten.The third time I watched Tenet, I was actively searching for the dangly bit. I saw it three times, understood about three quarters of the plot, and have given it eight stars.I do have a question though. Is making a film you have to watch multiple times to make sense of it a sneaky way of boosting the box office takings?"
87,"There was a time when I was a huge Nolan fan. The Prestige is still one of my all time favorite top ten movies. Yet the more movies Nolan makes, the more the luster wears off.Most of of Nolan's movies have some psuedo-science schtick you're asked to take with a leap of faith. Tesla's machine in Prestige. The gravity beings in Interstellar. Matroshyka dreams in Inception. See the pattern here? At his best Nolan is a supremely polished Abrams or Rian Johnson: more interested in advancing his vision than offering substance.Tenet is not his best.A review I read said that Tenet's problem is that Nolan has reached a level where he doesn't have to listen to anyone -- there's no one to pull him back and tell him something isn't working. Tenet is that ultimate conceit.It's a time-jinx movie that only explains half the rules... and then breaks all of them. Inversion is a gimmick that's used masterfully exactly ONCE. The rest of the time it's just smoke and mirrors to distract you from the fact that there is no reason to the movie, that it's characters are cardboard thin, the dialog is terrible, and at it's heart it's just a cerebral wannab-Bond flick that doesn't get the cerebral part right.Congrats, Mr. Nolan. You lived long enough to see yourself become the villain."
88,"It had to happen. I was not sure what to think about this movie, but I went anyway. It was a very strange and extremely confusing movie. ( my wife would have hated) Great special effects though no wonder it cost so much money. It was over all an entertaining movie but very long. However, It's not the kind of movie that you need to see on the big screen. You would be better off watching at home with the subtitle so you can understand what they are saying and maybe you have to rewind. A few times. The science was off but which made the movie more confusing plus made some of the sequence out of place and did not make senses. But it was a cool concept that is for sure. Denzel Washington son did a good job. It was a hard movie to watch at times. This kind of movie would do well in a tv series where they have time to explain and take their time develop the plot more. I give it 7 out of 10. Because of the special effect and an original story."
89,After exercising cerebrum capacity to its maximum extent I'm unsure if this was worth the effort - not the unravelling of the puzzle but what they were trying to save.
90,"And the loudest music you could hear in a movie. If you want to know the level of intelligence of the movie here are 2 ""non-spoiler"" lines:
-if ... happens the whole world will be destroyed.
Including my son?There you go ... Expand that to the whole movie and add some awful acting."
91,"Very interesting idea in movie. Its funny how some people say it is complicated story, yet it was very normal for me to watch and very easy to understand, even predict alot of stuff that happened. Anyway, fun movie, nice action, very good plot."
92,"Compared to Nolan's ingenious Inception, Tenet is also ingenious but too entropic. That is: the positive and negative entropy throughout the cinematically stunning film makes it difficult - sometimes too difficult - to follow. And it becomes a bit tedious to watch the long forward/backwards time/entropy scenes. The philosophical questions and paradox of time/entropy travels remain, just like in the Terminator series, but with the added twist of ""inversion"" and matter/antimatter annihilation, which - again - is ingenious, but chaotic, and perhaps too ambitious? Not among Nolan's best movies, sorry."
93,"Yes. Nolan did it again, repeating his own style he created another masterpeace! Plot of the movie is so complicated that even Inception is like a joke compare to TENET. That's the main reason why I love Nolan, he makes you really think about the plot. It's obvious, you can't understand Nolan's movies from one-time watching, so I'm keeping my ideas this time.
Recommended 10/10"
94,"I am an ardent fan of Christopher Nolan but frankly speaking this movie is pathetic. Looks like the sole aim was to confuse the audience than write a great script. If you look at movies like inception the confusion in screenplay was worth the story unlike in Tenet. Where is the exact logical explanation (not in real world) in the movie on how things are happening? Dunkirk has been a disappointment for Nolan fans but Tenet is a huge dent. Sorry, Mr. NOLAN we are disappointed with your attempy to confuse us rather than to be a great story teller as what you used to be."
95,"For me a science fiction movie has a science component in it. This felt more like fantasy, with the whole thing completely losing any sense of reality.
I just stopped watching after 1,5h when the car was driving backwards. Seriously, it just makes no sense. What a waste of time (some pun intended)."
96,"If you are expecting the adrenaline you got with Inception, look no further. If you are looking to be able to follow this film on the first viewing like you did with Inception, maybe not so much. I would put this film one level higher in complexity than Inception, as Inception was complex but pretty intuitive. This film CAN be intuitive, but unless you want to wait for the Blu Ray, you're going to have to shell out to see it multiple times to actually get a better understanding of the plot's finer points.
A more logistical thing to comment on: it seems the audio mix is lacking. I originally thought it was my theater (voices seem to carry too much bass, making them hard to understand; however, Studio Movie Grill plays this film very, very loud, which I love because it makes the gunfire far more realistic), but others have complained about this as well. I am hoping that the blu ray will be remastered so that this is not an issue.
With all this being said, be patient. This film is great and I have a strong feeling you will not be disappointed. It is classic Nolan doing what he does best. It is intricate, spares no expense, and it is by no means lazy. Once the BR comes out, it may actually turn into one his his best so far."
97,"The Nolan team don't skimp on the 'epic'ery of their films (although they may have to after the pandemic eats into the box office of this one).
It's not just a movie, it IS cinema.
It's like one, long advertisement for the new techno-fad of temporal flipping. They go about it as casually as a young technology sales person explaining the latest smartphone to you. You only kind of understand what they're saying but what they're SHOWING you is so cool you just go along with it.
It is a good film to help understand TIME as potentially the next great expanse to be explored.
There's a scene in Avengers: Endgame where they belittle concepts of time presented in Back To The Future and almost every other time-related sci-fi movie. Well, TeneT makes Endgame's own concept of time travel seem rudimentary.
Unique & interesting characters from John David Washington (3 names so gotta be good), Pattinson, Debicki, Brannagh & more!
Some of the most bizarre action sequences to ever unoccur on film.
Good."
98,"Spoiler-freeThe editing is confusing in places. One minute we are in one area and the next, the same character is in another area. Now this isn't part of the inversion process but just a general cut from one place to another but it was done so jarringly it felt as though it was thrown together quickly to reach a deadline.The plot is all over the place with a lot of loopholes but I guess the whole thing can be explained by saying ""Paradox"" a few more times.The acting is nothing special. In fact in some places I really struggled to hear what was being said because of a sudden loud piece of music drowning out the actor's one line. Again, was it thrown together? A decent sound mixer / composer would have avoided this issue.The action is ""meh"". Yes there are some cool inverted scenes but not enough to warrant the long run-time and at the end with most people in full riot gear, I really struggled to tell who was who and, more to the point, to care about any of them.More annoying is the film follows this pattern:1. do something cool.
2. explain how
3. talk about doing something cool
4. explain how
5. explain again for the people at the back
6. do something cool
7. explain what happened just in case people still aren't following.
8. explain again.
9. talk about doing something cool...It's the same process from start to start and, quite frankly, it is boring and that is something I never thought I would say. Inception was mesmerising from start to finish but this is misfire after misfire.Christopher Nolan thinks he is a clever filmmaker but, in this instance, he has just tried too hard."
99,"***** Potential SPOILERS *****Tenet follows the great Nolan tradition of really bad sound. It annoyingly loud and at times you can't hear what characters are saying. Nolan, fire your sound mixer. If you're mixing it yourself, fire yourself and get someone who knows what they're doing. Really s#!t work.It's also really badly edited (whether that's strictly editing or the script itself, who knows?). Some scenes happen with zero segue, and then at other points the movie gets bogged down. Unfortunately it's hard to care about the characters and story. Everything is a bit too rushed, and you don't have time to really soak it up and enjoy it.The time-bendiness is classic Nolan, but it's obscure and difficult to get a grasp on. Maybe the film will fare better with repeated viewings, but after a one-off watching it's potential tantalizingness is significantly diminished. Yes, there are some great things to ponder, but the core narrative of the story is buried so deep that it becomes a little ineffective. There is a reason for the time-bendiness, but it's obscured and to be honest I was a bit weary by the time it was all revealed.The basic plot of the film is okay, but I didn't really dig the ""inversion"" part. It's clunky and odd. Some great ideas and scenes, but overall it was difficult to follow clearly.Plus, the time-bendiness is never really explored in a way that lets you revel in it. Rather, it's hidden and revealed bit by bit which unfortunately means that you don't get to fully enjoy it.There's no theme here, at least in the way that other Nolan films have; Inception was about redemption, Interstellar was about the power of love or something, the Prestige was about revenge etc etc. This one doesn't really have that. Not a bad thing, though.The acting is okay, but Nolan never gives the audience time to settle in. The relationship between Washington and Debicki's characters seems to be important, but why? Who knows? Neither character is given time to answer that question sufficiently.This is really the main problem here. The pacing of the film is a bit all over the place, and it's hard to get involved with it. It jumps about from scene to scene at times with no explanation. I mean, I was able to follow it, but a few times I was asking ""What are they doing and why?"" and it took a while to understand (I'm not talking about the time-bendiness here either), which really diminished the film. In one scene, they're trying to get to a particular character. Why? You don't know till the scene is halfway finished. So instead you just sit there and watch them do some admittedly neat action scenes, but it's undermined because I have no idea what the goal is.Overall, it's okay. It spends too much time trying to hide it's big reveals for them to be effective, and it's too rushed/badly paced to get into. I hope that repeated viewings (on Netflix) will make it better."
100,I couldn't understand anything and had no idea what was going on after the first 60 minutes so I bounced
101,"The first part of the movie was relatively easy to grasp what was going on, with me being able to keep up fairly well with how the story was unfolding.However, an hour in or so and the story started to really accellerate with a pace I couldn't keep up with. I could not process every bit that was going on any longer, leading to further questions raised in my head the longer the movie continued.In the last part of the movie, some questions got answered and started to make sense, but still the vast majority of questions and uncertainties remained.All in all, I definitely need to watch the movie another couple of times to try and grasp certain passages I simply couldn't after watching it the first time."
102,"The general plot is comprehensible enough to enjoy the movie, try to dig a bit deeper into all the intricacies and you'll probably lose yourself really fast. The movie's premise is actually interesting, but at some points it gets a bit tiring trying to connect all the dots. Nolan's movies tend to think they're smarter then they really are (a big problem I had with interstellar), and this one suffers from the same problem, but 2.5 hours passed relatively fast, I can't say i didn't have fun watching it, however i don't plan on rewatching it."
103,"I will first start off by saying that my 2 favourite Nolan films BEFORE watching Tenet was Inception and Interstellar. Now Tenet joins the top of the list.To explain how good this film is without spoiling it. Is incredibly difficult. I honestly can't say much. This is something you really have to experience for youself.What I can say, is that...TENET is an action packed thriller, with many twists and turns that will make your head ache. Like mine is right now. I'm not good at reviews. But this film is Indeed a near perfect masterpiece.As just finishing it, I will give Tenet a 10/10"
104,"An intriguing, fast-paced, and creative spy thriller. It has an interesting concept for you to wrap your brain around that kept my brain stimulated for the duration. I saw a lot of people say they thought it was overly convoluted, but it felt fine to me (although those I watched it with disagree). Maybe my advantage going into it was I could hear the dialogue alright (many complained about the audio mixing) and I could keep up with everything going on in the film for the most part. But, I also could be missing much of it while not even realizing it. It's hard to know, because analyzing one aspect of the movie requires you to wrap your brain around the entire thing at once. I also saw some complaining about the exposition, but it was definitely necessary and it flowed fine for me.While still a solid movie, I think it would have been better with more fledged out characters. The only character we really got an in-depth look into was Kat. The rest of them were written generally the same as most protagonists and I feel the film could have benefited more from their persons being explored. Also, while the movie was fast-paced and action scenes were fun and innovative, I felt the urge for more gritty, brutal fight scenes rather than the many times we were given simple headlocks. While holes (or the opposite: more aspects coming to light) could become apparent to me on a rewatch, for now this sits in my mind as a solid action film. Certainly not Nolan's best, but certainly more unique and captivating than most blockbusters.7.6/10"
105,"Big plot holes and scenes that didn't make sense.
Acting was fantastic however - just the film in itself disappointing."
106,"This movie is a wild ride, but not always in a good way. Some of the movie makes very little sense. Still, cool action and great acting."
107,"I respect the cinematic art that is Tenet. It's just something you experience- and if you try to follow the plot it will be confusing. But in this case, that confusion is intentional and one thing is obvious, this film is an intentional well planned out vision of Christopher Nolan. That confidence and certainty of a director is what you respect. Many great filmmakers make strange mind bending films. I think the action in Tenet was entertaining and the concept was interesting. But I feel it came up short given the storytelling ability of Christopher Nolan.I think a top tier director like Nolan has a responsibility to level the tension. A film that's super intense for 2 1/2 hours straight is stressful. The audience has to do a lot of work to try to figure out what's going on and it's exhausting. You need to pull back and let some of it simmer. I think Nolan has entered the echo chamber stage of his career. No one's going to tell him no, or that somethings not right.**this paragraph doesn't have spoilers per say, as no one knows what this film is really about- but it you haven't seen the film, spoiler alert. I feel the Indian lady (aka oracle master weapons dealer) was flat and her entire subplot could have been cut out. And I wished the opening opera scene tied into the plot more- and I think there was too much plot being revealed through dialogue. The actors were having to explain the plot- and it still didn't make sense even to them! HahaI did enjoy it. Judging on a Nolan curve, I would give it a B+. I think it's probably his fourth best film. They will probably shower it with Oscars, but 10 years from now I don't think anybody's going to be quoting Tenant or talking about it, because it's unclear what it was about- without having it explained to you in a director's commentary. And Inception and Interstellar both played with time better than Tenet.Even though it was clearly visionary, a unique piece of art that plays with the rules of the medium and the backwards action stuff was innovative... in the end, the bad guy wasn't charismatic enough and the good guys were too busy explaining the world to each other, and the ending wasn't amazing. But it was highly entertaining and that's all you can ask for."
108,"Christopher Nolan? The man who keeps delivering.. I feel so stupid after seeing his movies the first time, but yet I'm still so impressed. He makes a movie, which I love, but not quite understand completely. I can't stop thinking about it and after some hours, I slowly start to make sense.Tenet was terrific, even tho my brain felt blended."
109,"This is the first film in a while where I'm going to watch it a second time, partly because I enjoyed it first time round, but primarily because I wanted to understand it better.It's a very, very good film, I enjoy complex, Tenet takes complex to a whole new level. Great if you have the ability to concentrate, frustrating I would imagine for a casual viewer, I heard several people moaning they hadn't a clue what they'd just watched.I found it rather exciting, and very entertaining, I'm not sure if it was the cinema I was in, but the sound wasn't exactly perfect, the music seemed to overpower the dialogue.Robert Pattinson, my heart sank when I heard he was going to play Batman, however, after watching this, I'm now convinced he'll do a great job, he was terrific in this.Don't be surprised if you want a second viewing for clarity, well worth it, excellent movie. 8/10."
110,"Upon entering the cinema to see this film i had my doubts; previous reviews i'd read did not suggest that this film would be enjoyable upon first time watching. A claim which i believe to be untrue! This film is more understandable than expected throughout many of its parts and does a good job of focusing the viewer's attention on details which are important to the story later on. Whilst a second watch will only further this understanding, I personally feel this is not a necessity. However, this film is a challenge to follow perfectly and I'm sure that most viewers (including myself) will leave questioning certain details. The sound mix is also not as bad as many suggest and is only noticeable in energetic action sequences which may be a choice to immerse the viewer as I'm sure it is hard to hear clear dialogue whilst bullets are flying! If you have the attention span and like a film that challenges your understanding of the world then this is definitely worth a watch!"
111,"So, after coming back from the cinema from watching Tenet for the first time, I was feeling such a buzz but at the same time if somebody had asked me (which they did..) what was it about, I would have just had to answer: no idea. Second time watching, it was so much clearer. The time inversion, going backwards and forwards makes sense and is logical. In fact, it's very cleverly thought out. Christopher Nolan does it again in that he makes something that just should not work actually make sense. You just have to give it time. And preferably watch it with subtitles. Just like a lot of his films, not only does it makes you want to talk about it, think up theories but it's also a great cinema experience.As for the rest of it, again typical Nolan. The music was so effective, it made me jump up in my seat with the tension of it along with the great directing. There were a lot of great shots (I mean seriously, wow), very spectacular scenes and the cinematography was on point. The acting was good even though it was less about the characters and more an ensemble piece/plot driven. Despite people having problems with the muffled dialogue, it personally didn't affect me.All in all, I would definitely recommend people to watch this film; the first watch for the amazing look and thrill of it and the second watch for the clever plot.Very good 8/10"
112,"This is a masterpiece with intense but not too loud music. In response to some comments and critiques: Even as an English learner and while eating nachos socially distanced in a major theater I was able to follow the plot and concept without any problems. While some were quite obvious at a certain point, I still loved every twist and turn. Despite its runtime not a second felt wasted and it mostly cut right to the chase. Best action and most innovative storyline I've seen in a long time."
113,"The first 40 minutes moved at warp speed. Almost like every gap in the conversation had been cut out to save time. Felt like Amy Sherman-Palladino was directing with rapid fire conversation like that.It got better as it went on, but like most mediocre action movie the characters were terrible and the plot did most of the leg work.I'll never watch this again."
114,I'd suggest people read the synopsis on Wikipedia before watching the time. Otherwise it would be too hard to follow. If you're the type of person who enjoys watching a movie multiple times and dissecting it then you'll enjoy Tenet
115,"'TENET'.
What does it mean?
Chris Nolan sharps up a complex,intriguing vision...and goes deeper within the inversion of matter and time. From a filmmaking standpoint,the film is flawless. It's massive and brilliantly written. It is surely,a piece for the times. The best of the best."
116,"It would help if you watched this again... No joke. The first time you watch it, you will be so confused and dumbfounded. When you watch it also it will make more sense. It will be tough for an average viewer to gather all the movie's information at the first watch. But the more you watch it, and the more hidden elements will come to light. And when you can put these hidden elements together. You will realize how much of a masterpiece this film will be. John David Washington and Robert Pattinson are PHENOMENAL in this film. Their dynamic duo and they both give their A-game for this. Elizabeth Debicki, Kenneth Branagh, Aaron Taylor Johnson, and Fiona Douriff are also great and did a good job doing their parts. The cinematography is excellent. The music, however, I do agree, is too loud, and sometimes I can't understand what they are saying. For a second time with a friend, we both realize how good this film is, and the last act is the most fun you will ever get in this film. Is it the best Nolan film...... NO. But it is one of those films you'll appreciate a lot. 9/10."
117,"If I'm being completely honest, the first time I saw this movie I quite literally thought the theater's sound system was messed up. But when I got out I looked it up and found that the movie just had this painfully bad sound mixing. Dialogue was very difficult to understand the first time I watched it but the second time, I understood it better. I even asked the front counter for the caption glasses they provide, I wish I got them the first time.The acting was spot on, I believed the characters were the characters and not the actors (well obviously Michael Caine was a bit difficult but you know what I mean). The actors were perfect for their roles.Soundtrack fit perfectly throughout the entire film, but at some parts, as I stated earlier, it was way too loud and you couldn't understand the dialogue as well as you would like, which is a shame because the dialogue is pretty crucial to the understanding of the movie.All in all, I'm happy I watched it a second time, because I definitely knew what to listen harder for. Christopher Nolan, while sometimes a bit too full of himself to let the audience understand dialogue, has an insane mind to be able to think of the things he thinks of for his movies. Would definitely recommend you watch, but not in IMAX, it's a bit loud."
118,"After a long wait, it is worth it. It has great scenes with great music that makes it even more impressive. But I missed Hans Zimmer. Great performance of John David Washington, till today I didn't know him :D"
119,"My Rating : 9/10Refreshing Sci-fi that must be experienced, 'felt' rather than 'understood' - Activate your Red brain and just let the action/drama take over your instincts.It's very confusing and perhaps not really as engaging as 'Inception' or 'Interstellar' - I didn't understand much but what I can conclude is that it's a fight-flight-freeze movie rather than a logical-memory-language oriented one.I enjoyed the amount of thought and hard work that went into it - it's just 'Tenet', man."
120,"I win the prize for spotting the only exchange of dialogue that isn't exposition in two and a half hours of ""You have to do this thing""
""Why ?"" ""Because it will make this other thing happen"" (cue the things happening -in CGI). I won't spoil the surprise but it's in the scene where Michael Caine gives his take-the-money-and-run cameo. Although there is nothing but plot, you should find it easy to identify the stock characters and allocate appropriate personalities. Beautiful, skinny seven foot tall woman who has accidentally married the world's most evil arms dealer ; World's most evil arms dealer (Branagh as Sergei Meerket) ; Dependable mockney soldier who has mysteriously risen to senior officer, despite an accent that drifts from Bow Bells to Beau Bridges. The CIA hero is without personality so he is brilliantly cast. Don't be put off by the cliches as they pile up or the plot points left hanging in the air like the bus in INCEPTION because apparently none of this has happened...except in the future. So can I have those two and a half hours back, please ?"
121,"It is complicated and can be hard to hear and/or understand all of the dialogue, which can be an issue when trying to absorb all of the crazy ideas included in this story, as well as connect to the characters. That's my only reason for not giving it 10 stars!You do have to pay attention to everything and even then you'd probably have to watch this one a few times to get all of what it has to offer.I loved the visuals and the score and music throughout. The idea was ambitious which I always appreciate. Robert Patterson and Kenneth Branagh were fantastic in their roles."
122,"Crap movie, zero emotional movement, no character development, pointless dialogue. One big spectacle used to hide it's glaring flaws. It's complexity is a farce to hide it's illogical inconsistencies while trying to force the spectator to splash more cash on wasted repeated viewings. It was like the director had zero interest in actually giving the audience a good experience but rather wanted them to admire his ""craft skills"".There was no synchronicity between the protagonist and the plot and zero emotional stakes. Ask yourself this, what actually was driving the main protagonist? Why does it matter to him? You could have replaced the main character with any other personality, flaws, drive and the movie would not have been affected one iota.And the antagonist?!? Tell me again his motivation for causing world war 3? And why did this have to involve inversion again? And what is the use of an antagonist or a protagonist when the latter just literally fights himself just so he can fight himself to stop himself from stopping himself just so he can achieves nothing which somehow allows the protagonist to achieve something which actually doesn't accomplish anything. So the antagonist literally achieved more against himself than the protagonist. So who was whose worse enemy??!? AND tell me again what the protagonist was actually trying to do again? This is what the modern world calls ""deep"".Tenet's ""complexity"" is nothing but a cheap trick to make dumb reviewers and moviegoers applaud a movie at their own expense. Any person with common sense would realise the emperor is wearing no clothes.Why pay for something and fall for a director's clever yet completely egotistical mindgame to make pawns of you and your wallets? This movie spits in the face of all the actually good complex movies of the past that actually had something to say and most importantly elevated it's audience beyond its own medium. There is literally nothing to take home from Tenet... It is just loud empty noise and will pass like a fart in the wind."
123,"Its one hell of a complicated film. It will be very hard for an average viewer to gather all the information provided by this movie at the first watch. But the more you watch it, more hidden elements will come to light. And when you are able to put these hidden elements together. You will realize that this movie is just a ""masterpiece"" which takes the legacy of Christopher Nolan ForwardIf I talk about acting, Then I have to say that Robert Pattinson has really proved himself as a very good actor in these recent years. And I am sure his acting skills will increase with time. His performance is charming and very smooth. Whenever he is on the camera, he steals the focus John David Washington is also fantastic in this movie. His performance is electrifying, I hope to see more from him in the future. Other characters such as Kenneth Branagh, Elizabeth, Himesh Patel, Dimple Kapadia, Clémence Poésy have also done quite well. And I dont think there is a need to talk about Michael CaineTalking about Music, its awesome. I dont think you will miss Hans Zimmer's score. Ludwig has done a sufficient job. There is no lack of good score in the movieGotta love the editing and post production which has been put into this movie. I think its fair to say this Nolan film has focused more in its post production."
124,Confused while watching it but with time to think about it afterwards it makes sense
125,"Great movie, very fast paced and you need to keep up! Loved it."
126,You shouldn't need to rewatch a film in order to understand it.
127,This movie is trying so hard being logically complex to the extend it make no sense whatsoever .Waste of time
128,"Firstly, on an IMAX screen this movie looks incredible and the sound is powerful. The action sequences with reverse entropy are groundbreaking and work into the fabric of the story and action really well. The thought of people running backwards sounds 'silly' however Nolan pulls it off effortlessly, the first scene we see this done really grips you into the movie and from that point on you are locked in for a great ride.As always Nolan has a complex story which in many ways like inception and memento leaves the audience to fill in some of the very strategically left blanks, which will keep you thinking long after the movie has finished. He gives his audience enough respect not to turn this movie into a science lesson which allows plenty of room for action.Overall this is a very smart, stylish action packed movie with a detailed story that delivers superb cinema."
129,Another masterpiece. I love it. Still thinking about what I watched. I need to watch again!
130,"Critics may not like it, just like they didn't like Interstellar. But Tenet really is incredible, and I'm sure the audience will agree with me when they see it. Enjoy!"
131,This was a confusing plotless film which relies on ambiguity to make the viewer think they are watching something unique and special. The dramatic music over every scene is ridiculous and unnecessary. Reversing the film footage isn't artistic. Just watch Déjà Vu if you want a impressive time travel film.
132,"After boring dunkirk, nolan provide you a movie what we can expect from him, its bold, complex and mind blowing..I cant give you any longer review since it will contain any spoiler which is very the main point to overall flow/plotAll i can say is the action, the story and the scoring...all is fantastic and superb especially the action...maybe the the music a bit too loud....but thats a classic nolan lol.Simply the best movie i ever seen for a long time.."
133,"I never understand Nolan's movies the first time. They're both more complex and simpler than I initially anticipate. As in, there are too many details to fully take in with one viewing but, at the same time, many events and themes overlap with each-other. The answers were already there but I know I'll have to see it a few times to really get it. In the meantime, this movie is stuck in my head like nothing I've ever seen before.Many of the classic Nolan tropes are here - weird time stuff, people in fancy suits explaining rules and one-upping each-other alternately with threats and quips, epic action scenes with shooting, explosions, cars and planes, jittery pounding music, people looking at watches, seeing events from multiple angles, saving the world coming down to personal relationships, etc. There are also interesting themes of lifting yourself up by the bootstraps and transcending or breaking the rules to kind of have your cake and eat it too. Characters do the impossible and we're not sure if they were on top of things the whole time or barely fluked it.Nolan's movies are sometimes criticised for being too pretentious or laborious with exposition, but they're just very intricate and intelligent. Do people want him to explain everything thoroughly or let you work it out for yourself? It's a fine line between accessibility and mystery, not to mention how bold and original he's trying to be. When brand new concepts are being explored, I think a little confusion on the first watch is perfectly reasonable. It's not like Einstein's theory of relativity was immediately accepted as obvious.The music is suitably intense but it was very loud. I think the balance may have been off at my cinema - I couldn't always understand the dialogue which was already tricky to follow. The plot was very tricky to follow although it keeps you involved and excited about where everything's leading. In particular, it's very vague in terms of who the bad guys are or what's actually at stake and why. But the plot thickens and starts to come together quite literally.There were some touches which I enjoyed like the red logos at the start and a blue one at the end and a scene with trains going in opposite directions from each-other forming a nice visual metaphor (those will make more sense once you see the movie).The actors were all really good. Branagh plays a convincing and very nasty Russian or Ukrainian criminal, Pattinson's an intelligent buddy with mysterious intentions while Washington's a likeable and funny protagonist for us to relate to, seemingly as confused as us for most of the film.The main thing that stands out for me is the concept of this movie itself which has never been done before. It's simple and implied in the posters and trailers but I couldn't predict how Nolan would actually make it work. Even if the broader story still has loose ends for me, I can't stop thinking about it. They apparently consulted Kip Thorne or other scientists (I saw his name in the credits) and the physics seem to hold up pretty well under the circumstances. The implications are fascinating and hard to get your head around.Some of the action scenes echo Inception's hallway fight scenes but with a different twist to them. Instead of playing with gravity, Nolan's playing with time. Again, it makes you marvel at what you're watching and how on Earth they filmed it. A lot of clever planning, choreographing, editing and multiple takes I guess. After Tenet, other movies seem so plain and light, what with their exclusively forward motion of time and entropy. Few movies can match the sheer intensity and intricacy of Tenet which I can't wait to watch again. None of Nolan's movies have disappointed me on multiple viewings."
134,"Getting really sick of movies with representation just for the sake of representation. Thoroughly enjoyed this move. Nothing being pushed in your face. Every character brings serious depth regardless of their color. Great storyline, with enough mystery, action and awesome music. Will rewatch."
135,"Excellent movie, concept story and everything as great, only reason that its getting a 9 instead of a 10 is because of the sound in the cinema, too loud and unpleasent at times, also the talking was slightly muddled at certain spots in my opinion, otherwise great movie"
136,"It was long yet I enjoyed every moment. But truth be known, I found the concepts a little hard to piece together. I suspect that is because at times it was very difficult to hear. The opening scene is loud and most people are wearing gas masks. And from there On, there are many times where it's hard to hear the dialogue over the other sounds. Maybe it was the cinema mix. Anyway, still enjoyed it immensely. Great stunts and locations, 9/10 acting, like the sci-fi concepts. More adventure than sci-go though, just FYI. Worth the time and money."
137,"Saw this first on Wednesday and then again today Friday. Left on Wednesday thinking 'Yeah that was great, but so much happened I really need to watch it again'. Left today thinking 'Superb, can I watch it over again as it's that good'.The final sequence with the red and blue squads is superb but only really understood it second time around.As someone else has said I struggled with the sound most of the way through the first viewing. Muffled voices through masks is not helpful but today I got most of it. The sound effects and pace of the film is relentless and doesn't give you a minute to catch your breath.Overall I would say it's fantastic. Just go and the cinema was super safe both times we went."
138,"Tenet is a practically perfect (re)introduction to the big screen. Whether audiences are ready - where safe - to return to cinemas en masse is another question entirely. Certainly, Tenet's a more challenging film than some may be comfortable with after a five-month absence, but this is an all-too-rare example of a master filmmaker putting everything on the table with, you sense, not a modicum of his vision compromised. The stakes have never been higher, but Tenet is exactly the film cinemas need right now."
139,"Tenet ist fantastic and gave me what only few movies did before - a whole new experience.Christopher Nolan delivered something that has never been seen before and made me walk out of the cinema backwards so I can walk in one more time to watch it again.It is a mindtwisting film and it made me talk about it for more than an hour after I watched it for the first time.And yes, it is not perfect as nothing in life is, yet it is a cinematic experience I won't forget and it is an entry in my list of movies you have to see at least once."
140,"Not best of nolan but still awesome
It is very confusing and surprising at the same time"
141,Nolan has done it again. This filmmaker is a genius. A must watch for all his fans.
142,"I watched the first 30 minutes of this rubbish with my wife and neither of us had a clue what was going on, the main character had the charisma of a piece of wood and apparently a speech impediment as we could not tell what the hell he was saying, a waste of time."
143,This movie is everything i love about sci fi. Thats all i need to say.
144,"This is the best experience you can get on theatre...This is a mind bending, innovatif and the action is like you never seen in movie before..Dont listen to stupid critics...you know what you expect from nolan movie...this movie is like memento meet inception meet interstellar and meet dark knight...it has complex plot and has so many detail you have to focus10/10"
145,"So apparently, according to Nolan, criminals now like to torture people in open air on train tracks, while train drivers pass by. Indian women talk to their husbands like they'd talk to their valet, and folks on the street of India are unfazed that some men jump-rope from buildings' top floors around, then nonchalantly walk away in the crowd. You can also put a guard to sleep within a second using a magic piece of cloth held loosely under the nose (very convenient!). I'll pass on the super-hero fighting skills of the main protagonist, or his unnecessary and constant attitude towards anyone, because it is not as irritating as the situations and character stories (the blond art aficionado wife divorce issue is a good exemple) thrown at us during the entire movie. Actually, I shouldn't say entire movie, because we got so bored we left before the end.There's a new style of movie in town, a little bit like the more recent James Bonds. It is made out of over-complicated scenarios based on bad, cheap ""witty"" interactions and dialogues, intertwined with extended, pompous action sequences that are incoherent and quite boring.One very strange fact to notice; the airplane preparation sequence soundtrack and scene construction, around 30 mins in, resembles the Kane plane heist scene in Batman 3 a little too much for comfort.Lastly, I have to talk about the sound. This movie, just like Inception or Dunkirk, is LOUD but the dialogues are not clear. You can barely understand anything that is said, while the rest of the movie will shred your tympani to pieces."
146,I was completely confused & I'm an very smart adult. It's as if Christopher Nolan aimed at confusing his audience. The plot line doesn't make sense even with its hypothesis. I wouldn't recommend watching it
147,"It's unfair to rate a movie after checking out half way through, but venting a bit of frustration might work: I was really looking forward to Tenet, but was gravely disappointed. Like Inception, Nolan devised a complicated and simply ludacrous concept to build his action movie around. I was so busy keeping up with the complicated plot and it's pseudo-scientific premise, I failed to ask myself 'do I really care?'. The answer was 'no'. Not enough to sit through a 2,5hr movie about time-travelling Russian gangsters. Tenet was actually just a rerun of Dark Knight's and Inception's action scenes, repackaged in a time-traveller movie. Nothing new or unexpected from Nolan. Frankly it felt like an over-serious Back to the Future: Feather-light entertainment made over-complicated. I was relieved reversely pressing the PLAY button on this one."
148,"This movie is dross! Rubbish! Detritus! Crap!Nolan has become so arrogant that he really doesn't care if we enjoy his movies or not. I am sad that I paid for a ticket to reward him. I am hoping my review may stop you from doing the same.He has stated that he doesn't care that we can't hear the dialogue. It is his artistic choice.Well, thank you, thank you, Chris!The dialogue that I could hear was so bad that I delighted in not having to hear anymore. It certainly did not elaborate on the non-existent plot or add to the non-existent character development.As for the action scenes... Well done Chris on saving tons of money by using the same footage twice, once shown forward and once backward. Great bang for your buck. Not so much for the audience buck.Seriously, people have felt they need to see this claptrap in order to show superiority by actually understanding and enjoying it. There is nothing to understand other than realise that Nolan is so far up his own anus that he can't actually see what he's directing. As for enjoying, I was fortunate that the theatre was largely empty so I was able to type this review during the movie and thus, at least, reduce the pain of watching it.Give this monstrosity a miss at all costs!!🙄"
149,"Watching this movie was the best movie/cinema experience I have ever had and you should definitely go and experience it too.It had great acting, story, cinematography, music and dialogue. The concept of inversion was worked out perfectly, just like you're used to from Nolan. Sure, it was complicated but if you pay attention it is really never incomprehensible. Because of the concept of inversion you'll set your eyes on things you have never seen before in any movie or series. That is also one of the many aspects that make Tenet a very special movie and a real experience, and an experience you will definitely want to experience again.
In my opinion, if you loved other Nolan movies like Inception, Interstellar, Memento and The Prestige you will undoubtedly absolutely love Tenet too.(I read that some people here had difficulties in hearing the dialogue. I am from The Netherlands so I watched it with subtitles, if you're also watching it with subtitles not hearing the dialogue will certainly not be a problem.)"
150,"Christopher Nolan has done it again. Like Denis Villeneuve and Kubrick, when Christopher Nolan makes a new movie attention needs to be paid. Not since Inception has a film been so brilliantly written. Ignore the negative reviews stating the film is awful. These morons clearly need to stick with crap from Marvel and Disney as they clearly have no intelligence or brain capacity. These morons probably thought Parasite was good! If however you want a film that gets better with every viewing due to its puzzle box script like Donnie Darko or Mulholland Drive then this is one of best films you will see all year.Only Dune will get anywhere near this, this year!"
151,"Yea yeah... Allies good, others evil, cold war BS, CIA so humane! White western woman saved from the evil eastern man since 100 years ago...
it's a smart-pretend movie for dumb people buying same old propaganda BS wrapped in a vomit of the new physics to make people feel dumb if they don't believe it..."
152,"One hour and thirty minutes in, this was the point I officially lost the plot. For the final hour I sat back, enjoyed the action set pieces, marvelled in the sound mixing but the plot was put out to pasture for me. Without completely spoiling for those yet to see it, Tenet is Christopher Nolan set loose on the manipulation of time as we know it. But that, that's only half the story here, because a lesson in physics isn't fully complete without government espionage set across multiple countries. But what really frustrates me is the potential this had going into the final hour. Two well built relationships, a budding cop comedy set up between lead and BFF Pattinson and an extremely well written vengeful hatred between husband and wife. What could have been. Six out of ten is my ultimate pick, but this deserved more, and ultimately entertainment, sitting back and enjoying a thrillingly paced film was sacrificed for an over complex exploration into scientific theory."
153,Can't hear anyone speak. Ear bleeding in parts. Huge practical set up effects. Intriguing and original story. But ultimately soulless.The lead actor is really really bad at acting he gives such a stale performance it looks like he is acting. Like he is on screen and you can tell he is trying to carefully remember what he's doing. Terrible.Storyline is clever and it's visually brilliant but it is a run by the numbers nolan flick.It's worth going to see on the big screen but you will come out of the cinema with a sore head from having your eyebrow raised to the roof for 2.5 hours.Nowhere near Nolan's best.
154,"Please ignore all the bad reviews and just watch it.
Don't judge the movie by it's first half because first half was little slow but second half will blow your mind.
We can say tenet is the mixture of all other works from Christopher nolan."
155,This film is so so so great everything is good i love so much robert patinson in christor nolan i love the action in this movie and the writing is so so so much great i really need see this again
156,"Nolan should have perhaps paid someone to make him understand what the meaning of entropy is. We are supposed to leave our brains at home when watching sci-fi. I get that. But this guy proceeds to insert an extremely convoluted plot with his idiotic idea of a very simple physics concept. I know that there are some sheep who will love this movie precisely because they don't understand it. Believe me, if you actually understand it, you'll hate the premise and the movie."
157,"Disgusting don't watch. Slow Plotting, not clear anything, it's hard try time travel but not gripping. Worst timeline, not awesome it's Oops. Miserable movie. Acting was good but storyline OMG pathetic."
158,"First let me start i was super excited to see this Christopher Nolan film as a fan of his previous complex story lines and a good initial rating.This film is dreadful no character build up at all, leaves you thinking what is going on all of the way through, poor acting and the list could go on. I wanted to walk out thoughtout this film it was that bad.Very, very disappointed think Nolan took his unique story telling in this to far and ruined it in doing so."
159,It really is just great. Best movie of the year so far.
160,"I loved the cinematography and the epic scale of this movie, it's been a while since i watched some original cinema. concept is very original, i loved the action in reverse and the way it filmed on this epic scale males it the perfect visual treat. Hats-off to chirstopher nolan for this epic action movie."
161,This movie very hard to follow. The beginning is very vague and that is why its difficult to understand the point of the story. But if you get threw all that you see one hell of a movie with plot twists and little hidden throwbacks to tie up the story.
162,"I must say I'm a big fan of Nolan and big fan of ""smart scifi"". This is why I had high excpectations going in to finally watch Tenet. And boy did it deliver! I just came out of the movie theatre feeling like my brain was just put in a blender. I will have to watch this movie a few more times to understand better what I just witnessed, and I will gladly do that!The best way to describe this movie shortly would be probably to just say that Tenet absolutely does not underestimate the viewer or try to explain things too much. This movie just happens, whether you are ready or not! This was probably the hardest movie that I have ever watched due to both complexity of the plot and fast pace of action. And probably one of the most rewarding also!This truly is a long-awaited masterpiece from Nolan!"
163,Best effects in a movie yet! The practical effects puts you in the film while you sit and enjoy. Truly a piece of hard work that has paid off
164,"Ambitious, thrilling and visually stunning; ""Tenet"" is unlike anything you've ever seen or experienced on the big screen. A continuously entertaining and mind-boggling epic.In this action thriller, fighting for the survival of the entire world, a man journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that will unfold in something beyond real time.I'm warning you now; before seeing ""Tenet"" check your brain at the door and let the movie work it's magic. You will be lost earlier than know it while trying to figure out what the hell is going on here, but that's the beauty of ""Tenet"". Don't try to figure out the plot during the movie, do that afterwards. ""Tenet"" is a mind game and no one could do it better than Chris Nolan. This film is beautifully shot, terrifically acted and the action is full throttle. John David Washington continues to impress in this complex role and Robert Pattinson delivers sharpness and humour in his terrific performance. Elizabeth Debicki is great and the iconic Kenneth Branagh plays a damn good villain who's obsessed with his Fitbit (keep an eye on that detail). Ludwig Goransson's score is trendy and powerful, a perfect match for this film. You'll most probably never get the answers you're looking for while watching this film but there's no doubt that Nolan is a master of his craft. I'm looking forward to seeing ""Tenet"" again and probably again after that, just to see things I missed the first time around (yes, it's one of those movies). That being said, upon my first viewing I can't help but think that ""Tenet"" is a monumental cinematic achievement that will continuously test your mind and simultaneously have you pinned to the edge of your seat... and not many films can achieve all of that today.Follow @snobmedia for all reviews!"
165,"NO SPOILERS QUICK REVIEW: Originally I would have scored this film a 7 out of 10 after my first watch, but upon rewatch I've began to love this film, finding it very fluent and intriguing as a blockbuster story. I must also compliment on the film's technical areas the score, effects, sound, cinematography etc. as they are very unique and masterful all around.Also I'd like to praise all of the cast on giving their full effort for Nolan once again especially John David Washington in the lead role. Personally I believe this film will age like fine wine and it will be treasured for years to come."
166,Just go for it! Can't say anything as every piece of the movie is a masterpiece!
167,"I had absolutely no idea what was going on from start to finish, on top of that the sound was terrible with muffled voices and over loud action scenes.I am a massive fan of the SCIFI genre, but this was one of the worst supposedly blockbuster SCIFI movies I have seen in a long time, and thats unfortunate as myself and lots of other people had been looking forward to the release of this movie."
168,"It's simply great to return to the cinema and watch a new movie for the first time in half a year due to the coronavirus pandemic. In addition to this, it's not just any movie but the new film by British cult director Christopher Nolan who has just celebrated his fiftieth birthday. As you might expect from his films, Tenet is visually stunning, profoundly philosophical and challengingly intellectual.On the positive side, the visual aspects of this science-fiction film are quite impressive. Especially the battle and car chase scenes are memorable and should be experienced at your local cinema and not on a streaming platform. The story comes around with a few surprises and multiple details that might take some time to sink in. Still, the plot never gets too complex or confusing. You need to stay fully focused for two and a half hours but you will get rewarded with a unique movie that walks off the beaten path. While the overall acting performances are overall average, Kenneth Branagh is absolutely stunning as unpredictable antagonist worthy of a classic movie of the James Bond franchise.Tenet is however not without a few flaws. While the story is quite intellectual, the emotional component is overall rather underwhelming. The protagonist is sympathetic but nothing more and the side characters are often lacking depth to a point when you stop caring about their fates. Instead of adding complex twists and turns to the story, the director should have developed the film's characters as only the antagonist can fully convince. The acting performances are overall unremarkable with the positive exception of Kenneth Branagh. John David Washington is at times lacking charisma and doesn't quite seem to fit the shoe of a blockbuster protagonist and Robert Pattinson doesn't exploit his full potential either and seems almost disconnected from his role as he seems to portray a careless youngster rather than a clever strategist.In the end, Tenet is an intellectually challenging science-fiction drama with stunning sound and visual effects. However, it isn't the masterpiece some people seem to suggest. If you haven't been watching any science-fiction movies recently, then you might be quite impressed but let me tell you that films like Freaks, Upgrade and The Witch are at least as great as and sometimes even better than Tenet."
169,"The movie is the loudest i have ever experienced. Absolutely deafening gun fire and music. Then I could barely hear or understand the dialogue, which went so fast it was difficult to process the information overload to try and make sense of what we had just seen. It got to the point where i gave ip caring. The lead actor was out of his depth. Jake Gylenhall would have been a better choice. The film was very disappointing indeed."
170,"To be honest I cannot comprehend why people are ""pumping up"" those scores... The movie is seriously boring and dull. I usually enjoy SF movies but this... Movie had literally no point. I watched approx 45 mins and I gave up. Poor script, forced action and absolutely no point. Poor actors (except one prominent name such as Michael Caine) and that is it...Waste of my time and money..."
171,"I have never written a movie review. However this masterpiece was so horrible I had to write one. Seemed like movie was made only for Nolan and few of his friends. There was complete disregard even for intelligent audience, where people are just forced to call it good because it is from Nolan. I always thought movie should be more of a storytelling art.Wanna waste your time looking at guns shooting and cars flying without context, go watch the movie."
172,My gosh! I literally sat on the edge of my seat for the entire show! The movie was gripping and exciting and unpredictable with little pockets of funny.Washington and Pattison paired perfectly on screen. Washington was a perfect choice for this role. At first I was skeptical but man I couldn't take my eyes off him.The movie goes back and forth and when it does you say oh and ah that's what that was. My gosh. I definitely will watch again. Man if covid did not exist this movie would have been huge!
173,"Taste in film is subjective. Either you like it or you don't. Though sometimes you might learn to love it (The Shining, Shawshank, to name a few that have aged well).I myself was hooked from the first scene (or fifth or ninth, I'm not really sure yet). I love that one doesn't ease in to the story as is the general principle in storytelling. You're not supposed to ease into this one. You're supposed to smash right into it, just like our protagonist is smashed in to the middle of his own story (or is it his own creation? I'm not really sure of that either). You're not merely following a story here, you're following a chain of events (or a cluster of events if you'd like) from the view of our present day protagonist. As we follow our protagonist on his journey along the string of time the knots ultimately loosens. To me that is brilliant storytelling.As the movie ages and you see it again and again, all the details you missed in the first viewings will make it grow and perhaps TENET will emerge as a masterpiece in time."
174,"Sir Christopher Nolan has saved Cinema once again. Thank you so much 😘. A must watch film. Clearly Nolan has set the bench mark above all.. It's really mind bending, beautiful film which I was in complete awe at the highest level of film making.. How the hell was he able to pull that off.. This is the classic film. The way film is directed, the technical achievement of film are faar too great.. It's like Nolan has raised the standard of what form of film making we would watch 10-15 years from now
For complete cinematic experience watch it only in theatres. Tenet definitely gets an A"
175,"An awful, confusing movie that at half way through, willed me to walk out. I couldn't care less what happened next, I was just bored with the complexity of the script and poor explanation of what the hell is going on."
176,"I usually love SF so was looking forward to this - but I have no idea what the point of this was ..... some kind of SF in the style of James Bond ?I found the ""inverted"" sequences hard to follow and impossible to track whether they actually made sense within the rules of this story. Many reviews say you will get them after 2-4 viewings, which brings me to the problem within that - at no point did I feel invested in any character, the film totally failed to hold my attention and I arrived at the 2 hour 30 minute point with a feeling of huge relief.There is no way I am investing 5-20 hours in the hope of understanding this !"
177,"This has it all - phenomenal acting, amazing soundtrack, car chases ... and a seriously thoughtful story line and script, which is so rare these days. Is it loud - yes, fantastically so. Are parts of the dialogue difficult to understand - yes, because they're part of the soundtrack or inverted. You're missing exactly nothing. Is the storyline convoluted - absolutely. Does it matter - no. You don't have to be amazingly smart to get this film. Just suspend disbelief a little and get behind the intent. And watch it again if you really want to figure it out."
178,"This film is not like any other films, mind bending. The soundtrack is absolutely stunning."
179,"I would rate the movie 4 for the first viewing and 6 for the second time. Considering that I have a PhD, it was indeed painful to pay both times."
180,"This is in my opinion the best movie made about time travel. Just as you'd expect from Nolan, the plot is complex and layered, and it employs a novel concept (or rather, mechanic) that provides great visuals and action scenes. It is a bit lacking in emotional and thematic depth, but that is not the focus of the movie. It is extremely satisfying when in the last half of the movie, the details you didn't understand until then start to make sense."
181,"Trying to take my bias opinion away from my critical, logical opinion. Few people comprehend the immense detail with the story, I don't even comprehend all of it, but now I understand enough to believe that this is Nolan's most elaborate story yet. This is a complicated movie, and complicated in a good way. If you (as an audience) don't enjoy or understand this movie I understand why and I don't blame you, but on the contrary if you do enjoy this movie, if you understand the story, then I understand why you may believe this to be one of the most intelligent films of all time. (BOLD claim). We already knew what to expect with the quality of cinematography, visual, score, and even to a certain extent, the wild plot that Christopher Nolan ALWAYS delivers because he's consistent with all his films. What we received with this film though, was simply unexpected. This wasn't a film like the dark knight which provides authenticity to a sci-fi world, or even inception which provided clarity after simple attention. This is a film that is intended to be searched, discovered, thought of, looked at, and inspected in every way possible. And yet, this a film intended to give no easy answers, no simple clarity, no instant gratification. This is a film that wants to defy the odds of films by building curiosity over time rather than losing it. Overall I have a lot to discover, a lot to learn, and a lot to understand from this film, yet I'm extremely pleased with its performance in most categories a film has to offer."
182,"While I think it's not Nolan best, I think it is definetly a really good movie, which you'll have to watch at least 2 times for understand, but it's worth it."
183,"If the directors for Endgame chose the same theories to guide their plot (and consistently stuck with the same concepts so that they wouldn't contradict themselves), I wouldn't have hated it so much. The way they filmed Tenet is so cool. The actors did absolutely brilliant jobs, especially considering the fact that they had to act out so much in reverse. I was sad to see that Hans Zimmer was absent for this film, but Göransson did an excellent job and really was able to enhance the experience of this movie. Once again, Christopher Nolan has made another masterpiece. I lived for the plot. My only critique is that Branagh's beard is... disturbing."
184,"The movie is thrilling with action. Backwards, time inversion and lots of confusing scenes. Tenet is a perfect movie to watch."
185,"Tenet is a very complicated film and I definitely felt that overwhelming confusion during my 1st viewing. However, after the 2nd time I was able to grasp so much more and truly appreciate what Nolan was going for.This is by no means a perfect movie and is not particularly one of my favorite movies by Nolan, atleast not yet...perhaps this film will only get better with repeat viewings.Some of the exposition given to audience is heavy-handed and can be alot to process. The nature in which many of the characters communicate does not come off as completely natural and can definitely throw you off. I cannot wait to watch this on blu-ray so I can put subtitles on to decipher all of the dialogue and grasp everything going on in each scene.Despite this minor flaw I had, the film picks up to a super fast pace during the second half of the film and had my eyes glued to the screen. Some of the stuff Nolan does with the camera is ingenious. Truly some of the coolest scenes I've experienced at the theatres.All technical film making aspects are top notch besides maybe some of the sound mixing as it can muffle some of the essential dialogue between characters.Overall, I had a really good time during my first view and a great time during my second. I don't think this is one of Nolan's masterpieces, but I do think it is a smart action spy thriller with cool twists and turns."
186,"Even though it is a bit hard to follow it's still one of Nolan's better movies. It really shows what cinema can achieve and it is a proof that both J. D. Washington and Robert Pattinson have bright future ahead pf them.
Certainly this movie can't compete with The Dark Knight or Inception but few movies out there were as daring and as ambitious as it was Tenet."
187,"Just like inception this movie is also a bit complicated but that's what nolan movies are all about..... A spy thriller with scifi components in it makes it even more intriguing.
This movie really is fire.
Visual effects are also awesome.
A must watch film."
188,"This is what happens when a director that basically has nothing to say on humanity try to do something complex/substantial. This is what happens when people make him a genius when the guy just basically directed comics adaptation. This is what happens when people put higher rating on a Batman#10 vs any other classic masterpiece. Nolan would better stick to shoot standard action movies. And when you basically direct your film based on market research, u better just keep it simple"
189,"This is another beautiful and innovative movie from Nolan and shares themes from several of his previous works. The achievements of the writers & special effects team are completely offset by 2 major factors.Firstly the dialogue:SFX volume mix is wayyyy off. Your ears will be ringing from the brass-heavy typical Nolan soundtrack and while your hearing is being destroyed you're forced to try and listen to characters mumble-whisper the rest of the time (seriously, they may as well be wearing Bane's face mask). This already major flaw is exasperated by the fact that the film is exposition-heavy and constantly trying to explain what's going on. I really wanted to hear what these characters had to say but for the second half of the movie I just focused on trying to read lips, which didn't work either.Second is the complete lack of character development. I have to idea why The Protagonist (John David Washington) cares so much for the villian's wife & her plight, nor do I know a single shred of anything about him aside from he's basically a spy. I'm left feeling like the movie spent so much time trying to explain itself to the audience that it forgot some of the core concepts of good film. Washington's character does get a few good lines which hint at a witty personality but they are sparsely peppered throughout the movie. It would've been great to see him get more non-exposition dialogue, so we could understand who he is and form more of an attachment to him. Unfortunately the flat, one dimensional characters of the Protagonist & Kat (Elizabeth Debicki) lends more to cheesy cliché rather than Nolan masterpiece.With those flaws out of the way, the rest of the movie was good, mentally stimulating fun. The shots were beautiful and true to Nolan's form.
Although, I'd have liked to see a little less 'shakey cam' towards the end. Fight scenes were a unique experience & the action itself is worth the price of admission. Kenneth Branagh plays a convincing ""baddie"" & makes a thin motivation work. Robert Pattinson does a great job in support (as he did in Lost City of Z) and uses limited screen-time & dialogue to flesh out his character well.I definitely will watch this film again but will wait until I can at home... with the volume low... and subtitles on."
190,The only reason I am giving 9/10 to this it's because it is too damn hard to make sense of it. I will need to rewatch it.
191,"Loved it. Action - Science-fiction movie.
Storyline is solid. The dialogue sound quality is a bit of an issue especially during very loud background action. Could be adjusted."
192,"This is like someone (Nolan) was joking and decided to spend 205.000.000$ on the crappiest scenario ever.
There is honestly nothing worth seeing in this movie. The picture is nice, but far from impressive. The story lacks convincing in every possible aspect and is utterly ridiculous. The originality? If you call stupidity original, then perhaps yes.
Let's see some stuff (if I still remember, since it's been more than a couple of weeks since I've watched this horrible, horrible movie):
1. The scientist invented a weapon that can wipe out the world, and then regretted it, so instead of destroying it, she divides it into several parts (artifacts) that she hides in the past, scattered around the world, and apparently together with the description and instructions describing what it is and how to reassemble the device. Seriously?! That's the best she could do?!?!
2. When people travel through time they need their own oxygen, but only in several scenes do they have the pipes and oxygen bag, while in most others they don't.
3. Things a time-traveler is using move backwards when in the past, but the person moves normally.
4. The highlight is the saying - not knowing is your greatest advantage?!?! Well, it did strike me on more than one occasion the script was written by a complete idiot.
5. One man is collecting the artifacts in order to destroy the world because he has cancer and wants the whole world (including his son) gone with him.
6. The protagonist is supposed to reach a powerful and well-guarded man who lives in a penthouse at the top of the building and whom no commoner saw in a long, long time. Two men get in and out of the place easily and without any problem. Just like that. Later on, the wife of that man (who is actually the one pulling strings) is freely walking among the city market, with less than a minimal number of security guides around her.
7. They can travel in time, but could not organize the final action better, without a terrible and pointless action where so many people died.
8. Eventually they retrieve all the artifacts, then again, instead of destroying them, they decide to hide them somewhere. C'mon!?!?! Why didn't they just killed the antagonist in the first place and left the originally hidden artifacts stay hidden where they were, if the whole point was simply to hide them again?!
There are probably far more ridiculously stupid moments, inconsistencies and gaps, throughout this 2.5 hours long agony of a movie.
There are so many good books in the world, and surely good scenarios - why is so much money spent on something so ultimately bad as is Tenet?!"
193,Duh you are watching some parallel universe time travelling past and future complex right here so yes it's complicated ... start it if you are going to completely focus ... be prepared because the moment you blink you loose track of every thing happening and you might need to watch it more than once but the moment you understand it you will appreciate every single shot in it ... MASTER PIECE ... well done to a crazy point .
194,"I already liked the movie at the first watch, but I saw it a second time in IMAX and it is amazing. Its visually stunning and has a great story line which has no plot holes in my opinion. But I had to figure it all out first and if you watch it with knowing whats happening in mind its truly amazing, awesome and a masterpiece!
The music is absolutly stunning and fits perfect!"
195,"Based on the assumption that entropy determines the arrow of time, TENET explores what could happen if entropy could be reversed, or ""Inverted"", for objects, people and even the environment around us. If we are rendering our planet inhabitable due to the excesses, wastefulness and ignorance of our generation and our predecessors, could our descendants want revenge and turn back the winds of time against us and erase our existence in an attempt to save their own?""A nuclear weapon can only affect our future. An inverted weapon might be able to affect our past as well.""TENET plays with the concepts of causality, free will and paradoxes. The film posits that paradoxes cannot be solved and that their consequences are unknowable. This is juxtaposed with the future's intention of annihilating the past, essentially creating a grandfather paradox. Perhaps, the people in the future have found a way to sidestep the paradox and create a different branch of reality?""Somewhere, sometime, a man in a crystalline tower throws a switch and Armageddon is both triggered and avoided.""In a race to stop the villain - an egotistical, abusive and dying man - from transmitting the location of ""The Algorithm"" - a device that can invert the entropy of our environment - to the people in future, the film takes its characters through multiple mind-bending sequences resulting from the puzzling implications of Inversion. The film takes some artistic license in depicting the consequences of inversion and treats the audience with several massive set pieces - unique in parts, accompanied by an intense score to spectacular effect.""That part is a little dramatic.""With the global threat averted, TENET ends on a melancholic note as the friendship at the heart of the film comes to an end (and also begins), loose ends are tied up and the world remains unaware of what could have happened.""No one cares about the bomb that didn't go off. Only the ones that did...""Although TENET packs too much plot for a two and a half hour film where everything cannot possibly be explained or understood by the audience on first viewing and it is easy to get lost into the intricacies of the mechanics of inversion, it is, nonetheless, a cinematic tour de force and a bold attempt at large scale, ambitious storytelling with a palindromic structure. Something we could use more of, for us and for our posterity."
196,"Another masterclass by Nolan. The genius to write such a movie with so much intermingled and intertwined if baffling.
This movie has been made to watch more than once to fully understand and appreciate it. Quite bold by Nolan but keeping true to his obvious fetish for time ( interstellar, memento, inception)
There are reviews giving out about music too loud or mumbled lines but these don't even come into such a gigantic and monumental achievement. Yes it will be great to watch it with subtitles but there's parts of the movie they have to wear a mask so obviously it'll be harder to hear (as we all know in current times). The score is spine tingling and thrilling - the louder the better I say.
Some people will be put off by the mental torture of trying to deal with time moving in 2 directions but just sit back and have faith that Nolan has you covered and it'll all make sense upon further viewings.
This movie is ahead of its time and will not be fully appreciated until it gets time to be viewed and reviewed and fully absorbed and pondered.
I for one look forward to watching it again and again for years to come just like Nolan's other greats.
You have to appreciate the fact that he uses minimal cgi when watching the edge of your seat action sequences.I just hope he's got more left in the tank to do it againSuperb!!!"
197,"As a massive, long-time fan of Christopher Nolan films, I was anxiously awaiting the release of this film. The pandemic pushed this films release back several months which only added to the anticipation, as well as the high expectations. I can honestly say that what he's released here is nothing short of cinematic magic. After the first viewing I was completely confounded by what I had seen. I knew I enjoyed the film and had an amazing experience, but I had so many questions that I didn't even know where to start. I was able to superficially understand the plot and have an appreciation for it, but there was so much underlying substance and nuance to unpack that I knew I needed at least two viewings to really appreciate it. If you're looking for rich character development you won't find it here. This film essentially moves between highly fervid action sequences which are masterfully done, and sharp exposition that attempts to explain the plot and mechanics by which this world operates within. I will admit that there are times in which the score beats you over the head with blaring intensity and you find yourself struggling to hear the dialogue, but for the most part it's absolutely amazing and adds to the experience in a dazzling way. Make no mistake, this film is tedious and mind-bending, but the pay-off makes it all worth it in the most classic Nolan way. Just be prepared to mentally go to work when you watch this film. Either way, Nolan continues to break ground with his trend of highly ambitious and ground-breaking cinema combined with excessively commercial and accessible at the same time."
198,"The only bad thing about this movie? That it had to be released in one of the worst years of our lives. This movie is so beautifully written and produced, and the execution of it all is really mind blowing. One of my favorite things about Nolan? He doesn't use CGI unless he absolutely has to. He loves the big set pieces and he is a genius at pulling them off. My next favorite thing about Nolan? He doesn't dumb down the script to satisfy a majority of people. He makes his art the way he wants to. I read this quote recently and I can't remember where but it basically said "" if you want dumb action, with no consequences or even a plot, go watch a Michael bay movie"". Perfect way to respond to some of the comments on here. It's simple, if you didn't get it, watch it again, maybe a few more times until you can appreciate it. If you still can't, stick to the simple movies. But don't get on here and bash this incredible movie. Nolan is a genius. The cast and crew did something remarkable here, and I wish it could have been appreciated by bigger audiences. Thanks China.To sum up, see this movie several times and you should absolutely love it, and more importantly, appreciate the work put into it."
199,"Tenet was a movie that I was really really excited for because of how unique the trailers made it out to be and I have to say this movie is fantastic but it also is very confusing and would take a couple of viewings to figure out which in my opinion I love because I love to do reviewing a of movies. But what makes tenet so special is just how unique it is compared to say Christopher Nolan's other movies like Dunkirk and the dark knight movies and other movies he has directed because I have to say I haven't seen a movie like this before. What also makes this movie so Great is the cast and I have to say everyone in this movie is fantastic from John David Washington to Robert Pattinson to Elizabeth debicki everyone just kills it in there roles. The action in this movie also is fantastic and super well shot and with the time manipulation concept it helps cause some amazing fights. The music also is just amazing from Tyler Scott's original song the plan to the fantastic score by Ludwig Göransson who obviously takes inspiration from some of the best. The story even though it's not the most original adds some super unique concepts to this movie that sets it apart from other movie and I love that. The villain played by Kenneth Branagh is fantastic and super Threatening. The movie also is super wellshot and looks fantastic. The one problem I have with this movie but it's a very small nitpick is at times it's very hard to tell what the characters are saying because of the audio mix it's a very minor problem that only happened once or twice but it didn't really take me out of the experience. Overall, I adored tenet from start to finish if you have the chance please go support this movie either at your local drive in or if your theaters are open and you feel safe enough to go, GO SUPPORT THIS MOVIE!"
200,"Nolan doesn't miss, period. Read the negative reviews, the overwhelming majority give Tenet 1 star citing they either a. Couldn't follow the plot b. Couldn't hear the dialogue or c. Both. Not to sound pretentious but while there are several clues/elements of the plot that I did not pick up on upon initial viewing, it doesn't take a genius to at least understand the general happenings of the film. Visually stunning and well worth the watch, an ambitious work that I thoroughly enjoyed. Ignore the plebes"
201,"It's a Nolan film so you pretty much know what to expect. It's complex but really fun and looks great, (though the audio is a bit difficult to hear). I'd say 8/10."
202,"Not a major Nolan fan, saying that this film was brilliant.I would say the best he's done yet, great cast and excellent story line."
203,"If you pay attention, you will experience bombshell after bombshell as certain things are revealed. It's a little hard to follow due to quiet and unclear dialogue, but it is a great movie with great writing, effects, acting, and action. I'll definitely be watching it again."
204,It's wonderful. It moves really fast and lots of talking but I understood exactly what was happening. The concept is ridiculous. Ridiculously spectacular. I love it. I'm going to see it again next week.
205,"An excellent movie, difficult to wrap your head around the concept after watching once, but executed well. It's fast and action packed and everything starts to come together towards the end. Great cinematography and effects. There was a few parts where I thought that the concept was inconsistent but a great movie overall."
206,"Tenet is an incredibly intricate film, exactly as one desires and expects coming from Christopher Nolan. The plot is fast-paced and continually builds upon itself until it reaches it's climax. This is definitely a film that demands your attention, and is probably not intended for those that just want to be entertained without being mentally engaged throughout the film. The script, score and filmography are exceptional. Nolan expertly explores the physical and philosophical aspects of time in the setting of an international espionage thriller. Highly recommend."
207,Excelent piece by Nolan. Lives up to the expectations. Second time even better
208,"While I am always trying to be objective when watching a movie, I find myself captivated by Nolan's Movies as soon as the first scene starts. Here is a director that does not compromise his ideas and expresses love for the cinematic experience with every frame.Tenet gives you no time for consideration in the first half, by taking all your attention to the mysterious premise of an unknown foe. In this time even the dullest scenes of remote meetings get interesting and are carried by John David Washington. Compared to Inception (2010), where every part of the strategy was explained to the audience, here there is ample room for interpretation and the tempo is building up to a point where there is no time to try.In the second half, my personal revelation was the transformation of Elizabeth Debicki's Character from a Woman in Distress in need of saving to a determined uncompromising heroine. This highlighted a change in the movie as a whole and increased my respect for Debicki's acting.Even though I was not surprised by every twist towards the end, I was entertained and in awe of the overall experience. I didn't feel overwhelmed by the theories that were introduced and was pleasantly surprised of the execution.I would recommend this movie to everyone who is willing to experience it first, before trying to understand it."
209,"What a film to welcome audiences back to cinemas. If you thought Inception or Interstellar were headscratchers, what til you get a load of Tenet. This is probably the most complex film I've ever seen. Christopher Nolan has recently become fixated on the concept of time and he takes his passion to mind-bending new heights in this film.The plot is, let's say, complicated. There's a whole lot going on that takes time to grasp. It will definitely take another watch to fully untangle, even with picking up on some of Nolan's classic subtleties.Simply put, the visuals are jaw-dropping. The way he films the time inversion in action scenes is stunning. I found myself amazed at how he managed to choreograph so many of these sequences. We're without legendary Hans Zimmer for this Nolan film, but Ludwig Goransson takes the reins and exceeds every expectation. His pulse-pounding, breathless score was terrific and fit the film perfectly.I have to mention my biggest issue with the film: the sound mixing. A sizable chunk of the dialogue is inaudible due to the blaring score and background noises. This really hampered understanding and the overall experience. Nolan seems to be getting progressively worse about this ever since Bane in The Dark Knight Rises.I found Tenet to be extremely entertaining and stimulating. I appreciate that there is a director in Hollywood who loves creating challenging, yet rewarding movies for filmgoers. Tenet is a fascinating puzzle to unravel and I'm excited to put more pieces together on future watches."
210,"I'm clicking the thumbs down on every Nolan fan boy and hollywood cronies reviews here on this site.If you want to waste your time and your money on this overrated (as usual) C. Nolan movie, go ahead and do it.An absolute nonsense that will leave you wondering what is wrong with the writer of this garbage. Impossible to enjoy anything here, to feel anything or to care about the flattest characters ever.I'm done with this pseudointellectual Hollywood filmaker. If there's something I have to thank Nolan after watching this is that I just made the decision of not paying a dime to see any other piece of trash he makes, ever."
211,"The film is really entertaining. But it's really confusing. The 1st hour is okay and then the second hour screws your brain hard with the final act making sense again. The action,cinematography and score were excellent. Definitely need to watch it twice"
212,"The movie is pretty convoluted and a bit hard to follow on a first watch. It will eventually click about halfway through the movie but its a better experience watching the movie once you have the knowledge from the first playthrough. Not Christopher Nolan's best work, but solid movie nonetheless. I feel like the protagonist wasn't very likable. Robert's character was the highlight of the movie."
213,A different twist to a movie! Things moving backwards made it a fun movie
214,"This movie is a masterpiece wrapped in an enigma of physics. Nolan uses ""time"" as a plot device (as he loves to do in his movies) in a way that has never been done before on the big screen before. If you like puzzles, you'll love unpacking the storyline of Tenet.Now I have to admit, the plot IS confusing. But how could it not be when events are unfolding backwards and forwards at the same time in the same space. But this is exactly what makes this movie so brilliant. Nolan's ability to take alternating directions of time and weave them together in a way that they interact with each other to drive the story forward is nothing short of genius. If you are confused by the end of the movie, watch an explanation video on YouTube. Then watch the movie again and you'll appreciate just how complex and masterful this movie really is.Simply some of the most fun I've had watching a movie in years. Nolan is hands down the best sci-fi director of this generation."
215,"Even thou it was confusing at times, I loved it and I highly recommend it."
216,"After watching it a second time I now feel like this is a masterpiece. Both in filmmaking, story telling and score. I'd highly recommend seeing it at least twice for you probably won't get it all during your first watch.It's like watching a visual puzzle, searching for clues (like birds flying backwards or waves acting weird) while being surprised by the bold and ruthless score. Not only the music is unapologetic, every bullet shot sounds like it's going straight into concrete. There's something merciless about it all. Combined with the relaxed - sometimes even understated - acting it makes you wonder what it is you're looking at. Like: everything suggests there's something large and important going on. Then why do I feel the main characters do not seem to take it very seriously? It wasn't until my second time watching it that I understood what was going on. At least, that's how I feel now... I'm planning on seeing it again soon, to check my theories (and to enjoy all those magnificent suits again).Main clue in my opinion? 'This whole operation is a temporal pincer'."
217,"One of the most thrilling movies i have seen, never looked on my watch, because it was so interesting. Music was outstanding.
A really good movie to go back to the theaters after this long time."
218,"Another Nolan masterpiece. Must watch
Robert Pattinson seems to return to his primr years"
219,"I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. The few problems I had with the movie had nothing to do with the story. Sometimes the sound mixing was rough. SFX and music overtook some dialogue, a few cliche lines which I will boil down to rushing. The main villain needed to be fleshed out a bit more. I watched this movie twice so far and have gleaned so much from the second watch. One of my favorite movies from the past two years."
220,"Early in the film one of the characters says: Don't try and make sense of it, just feel it. So that's what i did, and thankfully so. If you see this movie for the first time, and you try and make complete sense of the plot without having a doctors degree in astrophysics, your head will probably hurt. Your first viewing should be to just pay attention, and let the movie guide you forward (or backwards), don't try and put all the pieces together, because you can't. This is Nolan doing what he does best, which is manipulating time.It's a complex new film from Nolan, which previously has played with time in several of his films, but in different ways every time. From Different speeds in Inception and Interstellar to different time windows in which a story unfolds in Dunkirk, and the back and forth in Memento, Nolan seems to be obsessed with time. And by sticking to his guns as he calls it, he manages to make movies that looks like nothing before it. This is yet again, a movie only Nolan could have made.What i truly liked about this film is how Nolan from the very beginning show us hints about what's to come, but we don't yet know it. But when these small hints and sequences are finally revealed as the plot moves along, it's incredibly rewarding. It proves that he is a master of manipulation, which is a skill he truly needed to make this film, and movies like The Prestige. I'm not going to go into specifics how time works in this film, but it's a new take, from the trailers you already know it has something to with time inversion. Time that is moving backwards.For decades scientists have been discussing time, and how it works. For us humans, time moves forward. But does that mean it does that for everyone, or every thing? No. In quantum physics, there is no time, things move in all directions, and we humans are made up of atoms, which then does not move in one direction. But yet, we feel it that way.This movie's plot is anchored in these laws of quantum physics. Just like Nolan also used laws of physics in Interstellar for example, to describe how a spinning black hole can slow time so much that 1 hour close to it, equaled many many years on Earth. So even if Tenet for many people, won't make any sense, just see the movie for the first time with an open mind.If you can just enjoy the spectacular action sequences, the constant tension, the pounding music and the beautiful cinematography, this movie delivers pure and solid entertainment.I tried to put myself in Nolan's shoes after i saw this film. I thought to myself, if i had come up with this story, i would likely have doubted myself on every turn, because i could not let go, the amount of ifs and buts would explode my cranium.But I felt i understood the time trickery quite well in this film, and i enjoyed the entertainment for what it was, and i think it's one of the best action films, probably the best so far, this year. But i also felt like this movie was missing something, it might be a lack of character development, in which this movie has almost none. It might also be that i took a close look at some of the scenes closer to the climax, which was without doubt very difficult to coordinate and film, but i saw several mistakes.But all in all, what a spectacular film. Nolan is the only one in the industry that can make a film like this. It's just a bit sad he values plot and action more than connection with the characters, in which this movie needed a little bit more.8/10"
221,This will be hard to be spoiler free so here we go I won't go into the plot but just know that it's very tightly done and like most of Nolan's movies it's plot over characters so nothing supper interesting going on with the characters but the plot keeps it fresh and interesting the acting was good all around and visually is incredible this was my first Christopher Nolan movie in IMAX and it was insane the only problem is the sound mixing was a bit bad I had problems hearing dialogue I thought it was just my theatre but other people were saying the same thing and saying that's what it was like at other Nolan movies but I don't know. I feel this is a movie to watch a couple of times and all the science stuff was it as boring as it was in interstellar(still a good movie) I don't think this is his best movie but it's still really good and has a really interesting concept behind it I would it look into anything about this movie before you see it because that'll give you a better viewing experience if you are reading this and having seen the movie stop what you're doing and go now I strongly recommend this film to people and don't hurt you're head thinking about the movie
222,"When a filmmaker gets to write, direct and co-produce a pet project it can either be a masterpiece (Coppola's Apocalypse Now) or a total mess driven by vanity (Nolan's Tenet)Just what was he thinking? Surely the editor could have at least said No! you can't have a confused looking Washington nod at the word 'Paradox' then move swiftly on to the next incomprehensible plotless scene acting like he knows what's going on.This is Nolan's disaster. His Heaven's Gate. Hopefully it's not the end of his career as Memento and Inception were good."
223,"Bad casting. Unconvincing acting. Unlikeable, one dimensional characters. Annoying dialogue you can barely hear because of mumbling or loud background noise. Exposition galore. Pointless and nonsensical action scenes. Cliché bad guy. Trying to be too clever. Waste of time and money."
224,"'Tenet' is great. And that's not just because I finally saw a film in the cinema again! It's definitely not a ""time travel"" movie - it's a fast-paced, layered the-whole-world's-at-stake spy film, with some added mind-bending ""inversion"" included. For mine, this is better than 'Interstellar' & 'Dunkirk', but not quite the greatness of 'Inception' or 'The Prestige'. Still, Nolan's bar is so high, and this ticks so many boxes.The first 5min are so hectic and unrelenting, and rather than taking some time to pause and fill us in, the plot moves briskly as we follow the Protagonist (Washington - what a beard!) as he teams up with Neil (Pattinson) and are left to fill in some of the gaps - which I appreciate - rather than have them spoon fed to us. We then figure out how the villain (Branagh) - wish he had a better motivation - & his unwilling wife Kat (Debicki) fit in, as they do a Bond-esque globe-trotting - India, Estonia, Norway, England, Italy.Reminds me of 'Recursion' (by Blake Crouch) which I just read, but still a very unique take on the spy genre. Action galore, car chases, high stakes, exceptional score, and some truly amazing cinematography. Some of the ""inverse"" fight scenes and car stunts are extraordinary. It's all helped by how likeable and assured Washington is as the lead. Some of it's a bit confusing, but there's no time wasted getting into physics ""what-ifs"". Long-ish at 2.5 hours, but it whips by."
225,Tenet was a film only the writer could understand I'm sure it played out well in Nolan's head but on the big screen was a mess . The music and sound effects far too loud . Didn't care for any of the characters? What was the plot ?. If you're a casual movie goer . Definitely do not watch this .
226,Other reviewers weren't kidding when they said you can't understand the dialogue. How does this movie get released? When the plot is complicated you MUST be able to hear the lines. Nolan is a moron
227,Give this movie a chance and then give it a second chance to really soak it in! So many layers to this film makes it incredibly entertaining to witness the insane action and storytelling that's happening. Storytelling is gripping and complex. The acting is amazing all across the board and Nolan is on another level when it comes to directing and as usual he does not disappoint!
228,Backwards walking and backward talking.. not enough mind blown to keep you on the edge of your seats like inception. the leading guy does nothing for me either
229,Great opening scene. Great photography and effects. Terrible plot.Bad Continuity. Preposterous through and through and inhibited by bad acting. Yes Superfly and Dracula cant save this.
230,"Anyone giving this close 10/10 is deluded. I teach science and have a fairly decent grasp of the laws of thermodynamics, but this was way too complicated. The sound was terrible and by the end I had forgotten certain key points about the algorithm that wrapped the film up (mainly how the algorithm brought about the end of the world and needed to be buried - still non- plussed). You shouldn't need a notebook in a film. I think that the poor sound quality, length and unnecessary complicated plot are designed for people to watch it a second time...? Well, it won't be me."
231,"The movie was extremely confusing and I barely knew what was happening. At the end of the movie I realised I just wasted my money and time. You might call me an idiot and I ""just don't get the movie"" but let's be real, do you even remember the name of the main character?"
232,"Tenet, the best thing that happened in 2020
God bless Nolan"
233,"If you are a Nolan fan, wait, before hitting the dislike button, read the whole review, please.Marketing has been destroying cinema for years, and this movie is a clear example of it.For some reason, today's generation thinks that the more plot twists a movie has, the better it is. They couldn't be more wrong.Christopher Nolan became famous for making dumb people think they are smart.Please note, that I am not against movies that are difficult to understand e.g. ""Blow Up"" (Antonioni) or ""Persona"" (Bergman). As long as it's a meaningful difficulty in a good movie. And this one is not. Here's why:The acting was really poor. The main character had a very small screen presence, he didn't look like a badass like he was supposed to, he didn't even know how to walk like one.The only kind of interesting character is perhaps Robert Pattinson's character. The rest, are tremendously dull.This movie is not pleasant for cinephiles to watch as it doesn't have any of the two main things we look for in a movie: 1- It's not appealing technically, and 2- it has no emotional depth since it doesn't empathize the principle of intention and obstacle due to the poorly developed narrative.The first part of the movie, or most of it, where nothing happens, seems like a bad campaign mode from a shooting videogame.Some scenes are so dull that Nolan had to add the soundtrack for action scenes to them. This music was so annoying as it wasn't properly used.In the highway scene, the protagonist stopped the car with two fingers... Everyone in the audience was laughing at that scene...The use of fake science to try to justify the narrative is just a lame element.Nolan spent more narrative effort, trying to make you realize, you didn't get something in the plot, than actually presenting it in a good way in the first place. A clear example of this is the scene where he zooms in an 'orange string' from a character's backpack and then he does it again later, to reveal that it was the same character. (He did it for an unnecessarily long time so everyone could realize). These sorts of scenes are extremely unenjoyable for me and unproductive for a good narration of the story.He just does this to increase the ego of young people watching this film who are probably just a bunch of pseudo-intellectuals.In conclusion, again, this is a clear example of how marketing, hype, and pseudo-intellectualism together with many other elements, are destroying the film industry."
234,"This movie has so many layers, one couldn't possibly pick up on each one by the first watch. Too many impulses are triggered, to see beneath the surface.
On second watch, when your brain wont be only oquipied by trying to keep up with the complex storyline, you will discover the true meaning of it as well as the humanity and soul of the three main characters."
235,"Sorry Folks out of curiosity and endless wait I thought it's not going to release here so I watched it !!! I did it !! And I have no regrets except missed this one in theatres. And yet it needs a re-watch I'm sure going to watch again once it hits indian screen's or OTT !The title is a palindrome, reading the same backwards as forwards."" You're not shooting the bullet
You're Catching it"""" THE inverted sequences, Manipulated time and bullets,guns"" ""Wind Mills set in middle of the Ocean"" Actually the real original nolan Film will starts after 1 hr 23 min and the rest is a "", Nuclear holocaust""""Not a regular Nolan Film""
You have my word and I mean it !""A visually dazzling puzzle for film lovers to unlock, Tenet serves up all the cerebral spectacle audiences expect from a Christopher Nolan production.""Unlike other Nolan film's it has higher complexity levels With Out loud soud design and Best production values, Pretty editing, Terrific Background Score (Badly I missed the combinations of Zimmer with him) Power packed Action Sequences Specially Backward (Inverted) episodes are stunningly sited shoted created by both Nolan and Hayat!Welly managed the Prosperous flow with frames by Washington and Pattinson. But the actually problem with Debicki and Kenneth, why a genius craftsman like Nolan would hire stellar performers like debicki, Kenneth for creating unlike chemistry like our Indian commercials do ( Boyapati films Jaggu bhai and Rakul or Vivek-Sneha ) !There's no doubt Nolan Maama Garu delivered a solid classic with flattered strategies Puzzles but it's lack of logics Unlikely what his other film's did. The Idea was brilliant but not the outline as Savior of world from evil. This time he choosen ""Time"" as A ""Manipulative"" Evil. may be the most challenging of Nolan's films to date when it comes to wrapping one's mind around the concepts forming the narrative's foundation: backwards-moving entropy, non-linear thinking, temporal paradoxes.With TENET NOLAN MARKED HIS DEBUE IN BOND FILMS !"
236,"I've read some reviews and I'm mystified that none analize the movie in connection with his title. TENET is a part of the most famous palindrome in the world, and there are plenty of hints in the movie that refers to it. Maybe knowing it, may help more people to understand the concept that was the basis of the whole movie: What goes around comes around!
SATOR

TENET
OPERA
ROTAS"
237,"After reading the comments here , I'll lay this out for anyone that's still trying to decide to check this out. It's a complex but entertaining, visually amazing, It's something you'll want to watch again. If this is too much for you , I don't recommend it. I personally enjoy these movies . 'Annihilation' , 'Interstellar' , and many other movies will compare . Some people like predictably in their movies , if you do this is not for you . Not downgrading what people want or like for their entertainment, don't try and turn that into that . Clearly stating that if you like trying to figure out a storyline as your going through the movie , this is for you."
238,"Nolan's movies never disappoints me. This time, i think he didn't do the explaining part well that left the audiences confused. However, he still fools us all and continue his unique spirit that no one has."
239,"I regret not watching this subtitled as I have no idea what happened in this film.
It's confusing enough as it is, but when you can't understand what anyone is saying it's impossible. I advise everyone to watch this subtitled. I'm sure the film is good but it's a shame I couldn't hear any of the dialogue, the audio needs fixing"
240,"Tenet is a very powerful film. Not the best of the best by Nolan, but still, rises above his commonly high quality.
Plot speaking, we witness the usual time paradoxal complexity highened to ambitious levels: we see everything happen at the same time; past, future, entangled together. Some would say it lacks soul and afection for the characters (Nolan has already proved his talent in sentimental scripts). However, my interpretation is that it all comes together as a goal to show us what Robert Pattinson's Neil claims: the whole story is a conspiration, moving through the shadows of ignorance of everybody.
The film is quite brilliant in every other aspect. It intercuts classic spy scenes with breathtaking action sequences, directed with such intensity the movie passes by like it was merely a few minutes long. A special praise for both the prologue and the final sequence: an almost insane run against time, remembering war scenarios.
It is a movie one must see more than once, due to its complexity but also richness and detail. But, it is a Nolan project, so, everyone knows it is really worth our time."
241,Nolan did it again. The best movie I have ever seen in my life
242,"Tenet is a work of genius. Christopher Nolan delivers again with another heady action blockbuster. Like some of Nolan's previous efforts, Tenet is original and not a sequel, prequel, remake, or book adaptation. The film's story can be described as James Bond meets Inception, or James Bond on acid. With new talent at his disposal like John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki, and musical composer Ludwig Göransson, Nolan proves yet again his mastery of cinema.Nolan continues to create original concepts for each of his films. In Memento, the story unfolded in reverse. In Inception, he had multiple dream layers all moving more slowly in time the deeper the layer. In Interstellar, time was relative to space travel. In Dunkirk, time was disordered and then later reordered at a single climactic moment. In Tenet, characters and objects become inverted and travel backwards in time against objects moving forward. Only Christopher Nolan could come up with concepts so revolutionary and brain busting, only to make all of them work. It is even more astonishing that he makes these remarkable films only two or three years apart from each other. Tenet has Christopher Nolan written all over it. It features a lot of his trademarks like practical effects, gorgeous visuals, a talented ensemble, savvy banter, heady sci-fi themes, heart-pounding action, and an obsession with time. The characters were cool with the standout being Robert Pattinson. Pattinson was witty, stylish, and sophisticated in typical British fashion (he has come a long way since playing a gay vampire). The soundtrack from Ludwig Göransson -- doing his best to mimic Hans Zimmer who's absent due to commitments to Dune -- was epic and exciting. The sound design was loud yet immersive. The pacing was electric with an exciting set piece around every corner. The inversion concept humbles your own intellect. It leaves you in awe that Nolan could concoct such brilliance and make it work cinematically. The action, visuals, and music is a sensation for the eyes and ears, but the inversion is an all new experience for the mind.Tenet also features some of Nolan's worst trademarks like inaudible dialogue, extremely complex narrative structure, and emotional coldness. All of Nolan's films since The Dark Knight Rises muffle dialogue, the worst being in Tenet. Perhaps Nolan does this on purpose to intellectually mess with the audience, and hinder their ability to solve this cinematic Rubik's cube. Or maybe he wants to emphasize the visuals and the music instead of the dialogue. Either way subtitles are a must. To say Tenet is difficult to fully comprehend is a massive understatement. Events unfolding in reverse while action unfolds in real time is a brain buster in itself. Tenet wastes no time and spends much of the infrequent downtime explaining the plot or the physics of inversion. Many of Nolan's previous efforts are difficult to fully grasp after first viewing, which only increases the likelihood of watching the film again. Nolan's films are highly rewatchable thanks to this complexity, and of course the spectacle. In defense of this film being too difficult to follow, the scientist girl from the beginning said it best, ""Don't try to understand it, just feel it."" The spectacle and the theatricality feel incredible, yet is there an emotional core? There is attempted emotion, but most people do not go to see Tenet for the character relationships, and emotional catharsis. In defense of the film feeling emotionally empty, most films probably feel this way to people. All of Stanley Kubrick's films are emotionally cold. Nolan likes to stir our imaginations, our brains, and our adrenaline glands, not so much our hearts.Christopher Nolan is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time because with each film he makes he manages to thrill his audience with surface level action and drama, as well as layer each of his films with meaning and depth. There is always something new to pick up on after each viewing. Nolan combines the best elements of art house and commercial films to create the best kinds of films. Essentially, he combines the depth and intelligence of 2001: A Space Odyssey with the entertainment value of Star Wars. Tenet is another welcomed addition to this breed of artistic entertainment."
243,Dont waste your time watching it. It doesn't even look real n the actors are acting as if its their duty. No passion
244,"This movie just starts and keeps going. Its constantly throwing things at you and it doesnt really care if you are following along or not.
I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and for the first half I thought this was going to be a miss for me. I was following the story but i felt like something was missing. I trusted that if I stay invested that I would be rewarded by the end and man, that couldnt be more right. Around the halfway mark, Nolan starts to slowly show his hand at how the rest of the movie is gonna go and I WAS SO IN. He adds exactly what I thought was missing in the first half and made it all worth it. And by the time it comes to the end youll be begging to watch it again.
It rewards a curious and invested viewer and most certainly warrants multiple viewings. Im very happy with this movie and I highly recommend it."
245,"Christopher Nolan has been hit or miss over the years. But when he is on, he's on. Tenet is on.
Ever since I first saw the trailers last year, I was interested. And with going to the movies becoming such a rarity in 2020, I was looking forward to a magical movie experience and crossing my fingers that Mr Nolan would deliver. And I am happy to say that Tenet did the trick for me.
It is not a perfect movie, but it provides a modern day movie experience unlike any other I have ever seen. It does follow the normal 3 act film structure, but that seems to be where it's conventional ties somewhat taper off. Tenet is unconventional to say the least. It is a visual spectacle, the screen popped with crisp originality. The acting was strong, although the dialogue seemed mostly to service the plot. As far as the story, I can understand how some can find it confounding, perhaps unnecessarily so; however that does not mean the story is lost within the plot. It is not. This is solid story telling with an original and modern delivery.
I recommend Tenet, but it is a provisional recommendation. I understand that not everyone goes to the theater for the same reasons. I do like a well-told story. Delivery is key. I found myself comparing Tenet to other mind-bending time twisters: Primer, The Matrix and Donnie Darko specifically. Comparisons aside though, you will have to decide for yourself if you are in the mood to spend money on a story that does not follow a straight line."
246,"This movie was definitely worth a trip to the cinema during certain times. Although we had to wear a mask, this movie did not disappoint. Me and my boyfriend splashed the cash and were rewarded with us being the only two in the whole screening!Many say it's similar to Inception, which I agree with to a degree, in that it makes you think. It is a movie in which if you take your eyes off the screen you will miss something, which will confuse you. However, the movie as a whole was very captivating, John Washington played an amazing role, as did Robert Pattinson, who I haven't seen in anything other than Twilight lol.All in all I would definitely say this movie is worth a watch and I will definitely be watching it again!"
247,"At it's core Tenet is a classic spy/espionage/thriller but in traditional Nolan fashion he has to throw in his twists and curves but that's what makes Nolan, Nolan.I've only seen Tenet once so far and definitely have plans for multiple viewings as the inversion part of the film is rather complicated. It's made more so with how hard it is to understand/hear the dialogue. I saw this film in IMAX so the loud affects and score drowns out the actors. This made even more annoying due to how short exposition scenes are for a concept that's rather complex. I felt the explanation of what is the films feature concept ""inversion"" to be poor, but this could be due to how difficult at times it was to hear/understand making me wish for subtitles. Other than this issue I thought the film was great the characters, the actors delivered great performances especially John David Washington as ""the protagonist""The films score while I thought was great personally I felt Hans Zimmer's absence and this will most likely not even be something the general audience would recognize. Cinematography phenomenal, special affects beautiful especially in IMAX. I would highly recommend watching this film in IMAX usually I would believe how you choose to watch a film in whatever format is an opinion and personal preference. This is just not the case in my opinion for Tenet I saw it in IMAX but not true IMAX. I could see and feel I wasn't getting everything so I would say this is a must watch in 70mm IMAX. After seeing it I understand why Nolan is adamant on his film being viewed in theaters and in 70mm.Overall while I thoroughly enjoyed this film I find myself feeling somewhat disappointed and left wanting. Which is a very foreign feeling for me when it comes to Nolan as I have loved every single film of his immensely. Perhaps this is end of my honeymoon phase with Nolan but I'm hoping after multiple viewings I will understand and enjoy it more.8/10"
248,"I'll admit: I probably have to watch this movie again. I'm usually pretty good at unraveling a Christopher Nolan movie when I watch it for the first time. Not since Memento (2000), have I had such a difficult time piecing together the intertwining timelines. At least with Memento, I was aided by the black-and-white sections. In Tenet (2020), time moves in both directions in the same scene. Sure, this is a visually-stunning feat, but it's often a slap in the face of the Grandfather Paradox, which Tenet simply waves away with a shrug and a ""don't worry about it.""What's interesting is how moments of foreshadowing in this film triggered my ""lightbulb reflex"" each time the corresponding portion of the plot came into focus and gave me the ""aha moment."" I'm sure I'll pick up more of these when I watch it a second time. As it stands after a single viewing, my mind was exhausted by the end as I tried to keep track of everything that was happening. Sure, it helps when the movie revisits a few key scenes in forward and backward time (thus giving the audience more time to piece together everything).I think the main issue I had with this film was how it was trying so hard to sell the ""time travel"" concept within the standard action film framework. Why did the antagonist want to destroy the world? Narcissism, probably-which isn't that strong of a motivator in my book. I'm sure this would be the type of film Nolan would make if he tried his hand at the James Bond franchise. As it stands, I feel there are some logical plot holes that weaken the movie as a whole. Sure, I love the amazing Inception (2010)-like visuals but unraveling such a complex idea like this only caused me to ask more questions.Visually stunning, but mind-numbingly complex, I give Tenet 4.0 stars out of 5."
249,"I'm not gonna lie, first viewing was a big letdown. As a Nolan fan myself, I was shocked to see what I considered ""annoying bad"" writing and sound design. The sound design still is a problem as of writing this, but upon second viewing, it was like a little switch flicked on every time I saw something I didn't understand from the last viewing. The little details that I considered bad writing suddenly seemed like an obvious answer. The cheesy parts I thought were, well cheesy, had so much more depth. I'm not going to spoil it, but thinking about The Protagonist and Neil makes me feel so many emotions that upon second viewing never made me feel the way I did, truly beautiful. No movie is perfect, this one definitely isn't perfect. This is no Dunkirk or Inception, but I guarantee this movie will make you use your brain."
250,"Couldn't hear half the dialogue and only understood half of the rest, but it's a testament to Nolan's ambitious and undeniably exciting brand of filmmaking that I was on the edge of my seat throughout regardless: the espionage plot and sci-fi concept are both confusing but compelling, the action is brilliant, the technical aspects top notch. It's a shame the only emotion is found in yet another Russian villain and a simply modernized damsel-in-distress (Debicki's turn remains excellent though).
7.5/10"
251,"Loved! It!
Yes It's complicated.. yes, you have to stay focused to understand it... but man oh man, does this movie deliver!
I want to see it again, and again and perhaps even again..
Great actors. Intense music. Breathtaking locations..
It made me want to stand up and applause.
Masterpiece!"
252,We'll be talking about this movie for years. Excited to see it again. Washington was unbelievable!
253,"Tenet is the latest Christopher Nolan film starring John David Washington, Elizabeth debicki, Robert Pattinson and keneneth Branagh.
I can't and I don't know how to explain the story. it's a movie that you have to watch it at least twice and I'm going to rewatch it this week. All I can tell you is this is an awesome well made spy/sci-fi movie that you've never seen. Just watch the trailer and go to your local theater.
The first thing that got my attention into the movie was the music oh my god! The music score of this film is incredible. It's an instance film every action moment is instance! but as soon as music starts you're into the movie and this time ludwig goranssson did the soundtrack who also did black panther and won an Oscar for that and also did a few more movies soundtrack and this was his best one imo. The casting choice and acting is great but the Characterizations is a little bit weak not just this film almost the most of the Christopher Nolan films characters I don't care about them Me and the most of the audiences mostly care about the storyline and the things are happening during the movie. Most of his characters are like video games characters and the audiences are the gamers so to watch and understand his movies you have to use your brain as your gaming controller imo. I love the fact that Nolan always avoid green screen and try to use practical effects and that makes the cast performances and action scenes 100 times better and real. And that's why this was by far my best cinematic experience in a movie theater I felt like I was in the movie. Overall it's an awesome well made film that is totally worth watching and paying in cinemas even twice! It's complicating it's crazy and that was everything I wanted from a Nolan film even more what I was expecting! This is one of his best works for the past decade and also one of the best movies of 2020 and this decade. I liked this more than inception. My score for tenet will be a 9/10 for now I may change my mind after second or multiple viewing."
254,"Incompetent on every level.An incoherent story, atrocious casting, dull performances, confusing concept, plot points that have no obvious connection. A threat that is hurredly described and not shown in any helpful way.Even the special effects are lacklustre, reverse footage (not exactly groundbreaking) and some very wobbly miniature-looking miniatures.No scene logically connects to the next scene, the first 20 minutes feels like very poor editing, and the final 20 minutes is a dull retreading of the previous 2 hours of film we've had to endure. Many times I held my head in my hands in confusion, in pain at the effort to understand important pieces of plot delivered over roaring helicopter blades or muffled through gas masks.Some truly comically jarring elements in the climax and point of highest tension in the film, defused rather unsatisfyingly.None of the plot twists will be a surprise to anyone with a functioning optical capacity.And massively distracting to have a leading lady 8 feet taller than the leading man.The only saving grace is that the film was lit. I could literally see what was happening. That is all.Garbage!"
255,"After having seen the film 3 times I can confidently say that I do not get the hate at all. This film has everything. Performances, visuals, originality; they are all of the highest standard. I have recommended this film to so many people. Don't worry if you think it will be too complicated. Nolan's screenwriting talent shone in this film and a complex idea has been explained so well. What a film."
256,All the people rating it really low haven't even watched the film - don't listen to them - they're marvel idiots that hate Nolan
257,"I walked out probably an hour into the movie.The background music and every single sound in this movie, even when there's no music playing, there's a silent fan or a constantly disjointed sound in the background that's there to make you feel uneasy and on edge.I havnt been to movies in a while, and this just made me feel uneasy to the point where it wasn't worth me even waiting to find out what the movie was really about.There's a difference between using music to create tension vs downright disrupting the human experience and overloading their senses to the point where someone had to walk out.If you like watching senseless action, camera and music that puts you on edge, 0 character development or back story, and want a cheap thrill to shake you up because you've been sitting at home too long, this might be worth a watch."
258,"This is again, a masterpiece made by the mastermind Christopher Nolan, the audio and visual experience in IMAX is something unreal!
This is incomparable, indescribable experience, a feast for your eyes and ears, and a trance, an ecstasy for your mind, only if you're smart enough to keep up with that unusual world of tenet, the nonlinear storytelling makes it even more and more satisfying.Yet, a pain in the brain, a headache for those people with limited brain abilities wanting to enjoy something easy, simple, and linear.Music?
top notch, surprisingly astonishing, makes your heart beat with every second, takes you from the first moment to the last moment in a journey of extreme chills.
Ludwig has done the work we've been hoping for, and even surpasses that!
Hans zimmer is proud.Visuals?
Just real shit! No avengers there, only real people, real cars, real action, it takes you inside the movie!Cinematography?
Couldn't be any better.Story? Acting? Editing? e.t.c.
10/10Watching all Nolan movies, many times, taught me something!
Some movies are subject to comparisons with their rivals, but some aren't, simply because you'll never find rivals for those movies, no similar ideas, no such implementations ever done before, no such genre has ever been created before.Watch Nolan's movies and never try to compare them to anything else, Nolan creates his own genres, TENET is a totally new genre of movies, and a never before seen or felt experience, watch it and enjoy it.It doesn't matter whether you like the movie or not, the truth is TENET is incomparable to anything else ever done, if Nolan's movies are incomparable, then TENET is on the top of the list.Whether you left the theater in ecstasy or rage and hatred, be sure that the more you'll think about the magnificence of that feast, the more you'll love and appreciate this movie."
259,"I'm used to watching complicated movies, being a Nolan fan. However, this one was really next level. Although I didn't understand everything, the complicated plot didn't bother me. I'm definitely going to re-watch the movie a couple of times. Apart from the plot, Nolan also managed to turn it into an impressive blockbuster with a spy-like theme. It is packed with action scenes, explosions, and beautiful stunt work. I've seen the movie in IMAX, which I recommend to everyone. Very impressive experience.I think this movie is certainly not for everyone. If you don't like complicated plots and want to sit back while watching an action movie, you might want to wait until the new Bond movie comes out in November..."
260,"What can I say, recorded in a perfect way, and completely mind blowing.Even you fully focus you will need to watch it two or three times to get it."
261,"A super fresh take on the spy theme, with immaculate ideas, outstanding visuals, great characters, and amazingly coordinated action sequences !"
262,"Tenet is the newest movie from legendary director Christopher Nolan who delivers the intricacy of the story that he brings to all of his other films. The concept itself displays what Nolan does best which is swinging for the fences and it pays off once more. I can guarantee this is something you have never seen before. The plot is full of twists and turns which work because of the stellar acting from John David-Washington (the Protagonist), Robert Pattinson (Neil) and Kenneth Branagh (Andrei Sator) and the writing by Nolan himself. The mix between practical effects and CGI work perfectly together and they blend really well. The score is brilliant and exactly what you can expect from Oscar winner Ludwig Göransen, it is perfect for the story they're telling and I'm sure it will bring more awards his way. The film never lets up and the pace is rapid with the audience having to pay full attention at all times. The decision to not give the main character an actual name is perfect and explains what the organisation (Tenet) is to the viewer in a very subtle way.
Overall, I loved this film, for sure parts of it were confusing but it is still an incredibly entertaining ride which I highly recommend to anyone who loves to watch something they have never seen before."
263,"I expected more after 10 years, should have been a lot better...
Casting should have more top actors/actresses to get move up there.
Why Leo didn't perform in this one... should have been there.Movie is just not in that line with Inception. It's good but it is not that good.Sorry mr. Nolan (director & writer) but you've failed this time. We expected more from you!"
264,"This was an incredible experience! The sound design and music in my showing was phenomenal so I'm not sure what other people experienced but they must have fixed it. This was action-packed, brilliantly paced from the get-go, and filled with plenty of ""A-ha!"" moments that felt both surprising and inevitable. I'm docking one star off because at times it felt a little emotionally uneven and I found myself wanting slightly higher emotional stakes besides the thrill of the action. A re-watch would probably be a 10/10 experience (no spoilers but it's one of those films that probably hits different once you know the ending) but as it stands I was left wanting a little more heart. Don't go into this expecting to understand everything at once. Go with the flow! Be mindful of the details and tuck them away for delayed gratification later on."
265,This movie challenges the audience next level. It is confusing but it is easy to follow the story. Easily one of his most genius films. Idk why ppl are complaining abt it being too confusing cos christopher nolan is known for making confusing movies and this one was his most ambitious project. The movie is incredibly smart. As film lovers we should appreciate directors who like challenging viewers.
266,Tenet appears to be one of the most misunderstood and ergo underrated movies.
267,So good I'll have to see it more than twice to be completely satisfied
268,"Beautifully done, and they got the time-stuff correct, with only minor contradictions. Or those contradictions may just be me having missed certain details. It went a bit too fast, the names and the context. And it was too loud sometimes."
269,"I'll just say that if you lose focus to think about who might be texting you, you'll get lost in the timeline or miss a valuable piece of information. That being said, my attention did not wane and I loved this movie. The science in this film might not make sense to non physics majors like me, but the use of the science to create tension and consequential stakes for humanity is done in a way we've never seen before.
Time will tell (No pun intended) if this film has classic greatness in it, but I'm hopeful."
270,"This movie is brilliant. Really it is. Conceptually it's something completely new and fascinating, and it left me for days afterwards enjoying thinking through what it would mean to move as one who is inverted. The way this all plays out on the screen is enthralling, and then various reveals really landed for me. It bends your mind in a totally new way.What really took away from this movie for me was the decision to have the music and background noises be so loud, and be layered over the top of the speech. It makes it really hard to hear what the characters are saying. From what I've read online this was a decision, not an accident, but it seems to me to have been a bad decision. It will probably stop me watching the film again, as I can remember the frustration in so many scenes where I can't quite hear what each character is saying."
271,"As I left the theatre I joked that Tenet is basically if Interstellar and Inception had a baby and Memento was hired as the nanny. That illustration will either excite you or overwhelm you.If you like Christopher Nolan I'm sure you will like this one. If you're looking for something ""brand new"" out of him you probably won't find it here. His films have a specific style and this one is on brand. It works for me but it might not for everyone.I will say, I appreciate his longing to continue to use practical effects as well as wanting to think outside the box in what is possible for on screen storytelling. You never feel like he has mailed in a project and it comes across as the viewer, and that alone is a win."
272,"First time I've ever left a review on IMDB. I'm still seething for the lost time and money. This film is devoid of merit. I've enjoyed the majority of this director's output, had no issue with the casting or central premise, but the execution was bordering on the insulting. Wooden acting, stilted dialogue. Pointless set pieces, delivered without care or interest in wanting to engage the viewer. My only enjoyment was hoping that the 'baddie' got his way and ended this mess. I 'got' the point, but the point was pointless. (Spoiler) Watching a hired army (whose motivation I had no idea on) running backwards, while another bunch ran forward was comical, yawn-inducing, and dull, dull, dull. This truly was French and Saunders does Inception, without the intentional laughs. I genuinely felt that Nolan was sticking a middle finger up at points and I don't appreciate the gag. I'd prefer to watch a season of Mrs Brown's Boys. Don't pretend it is good - it is ok to dislike this but enjoy Nolan's work either side of it. Tenot."
273,"So, basically ""Tenet"" is just ""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"" sprinkled with Christopher Nolan's usual blend of pompous, pseudo-intellectual rubbish.P.s. Oh, except the girl is villain's wife, not hero's."
274,"Nolan movies are all lacking character developement and emotions. They are like a designer couch nobody wants to sit on, because at first glance it looks extraordinary, but the more you look at it you think it's all concept and function but what's most important isn't there: it isn't emotional and doesn't touch your heart! Christopher Nolan movies are all pseudo intellectual! He tries to be so smart and intelligent that he forgets that feelings and emotions make a good movie and when it's smart and clever it will be a very good movie. When you don't care about the protagonists anymore the director has failed. To carry this metaphor further in Tenet Christopher Nolan showed everybody again that he is able to design a sofa that's maybe different and unusual, but he fails to make it comfy and desirable. And one more thing: why in Nolans movies has there always to be this weird 007 James Bond feeling? It's annoying!"
275,"Worst movie I've seen in a while. No character building, no introduction to anything, just a lot of plot holes from an over complex theory which no one knows anything about - time travel. Loads of really pointless action scenes. Tried to bring back USA vs Russia stereotypes."
276,"Has Christopher Nolan lost it? This is the first Nolan film I actually dislike and im usually a big fan of his. Inception is one of my fav films of all time so I went into this thinking I would at least enjoy elements of it. I didn't. The concept is no where near as enticing as Inception and the execution was very poor.It had no redeeming features either as apart from Pattinson (who was quite good) the performances lacked conviction, the action was very dull and all the plot was told during lengthy dialogue sequences where the characters explain everything to each other. Music sounded like a parody of itself and the world in which all this takes place was dull and lacked a sense of place. Nothing felt real.It felt like Nolan really wanted to make a James Bond film and threw in the backwards bullets to give a sci-fi twist. Unfortunately he does not seem to know what makes Bond work and all we get is his lifeless characters and environments mixed with a science lecture. I'm not surprised he hasn't been given an actual Bond film of his own to make if this is what he pitched."
277,"Truly awful. I can't even begin to lay out everything wrong with this film. Leaving aside the consistency of the 'time-travel' aspect; cinematically it doesn't work.There were so many scenes which didn't progress the story whatsoever, and just served as a really awful dialogue exposition of story information, blegh, this is bad even for crappy TV dramas, where characters repetitively walk through streets or corridors talking and giving detailed story exposition, but to see this in a major blockbuster Hollywood film is just depressing.The time travel was gimmicky, and needlessly complicated. So many characters served no real purpose and were a waste of screen-time. And the motivations of the characters were completely absent, it was totally unconvincing. Why did the scary Russian man want to destroy the world? cause he had cancer and was sad?? really? Why did the main protagonist want to save the woman so bad? There was no connection or chemistry, at the start of the film he tells the other agent he would take women and children hostage if he needed to, setting him up as a ruthless character, yet halfway through the film he compromises his mission, the object and information to save a woman he has no connection with, so I guess its cause he's a good guy right? Well no, actually he was supposed to fail all along! so then he could actually succeed.... mind=blown, man!!!1! terrible, empty characters and story, leaving the viewing experience irritatingly loud, flashy, action sequences that drag on far too long. 1/10"
278,"Way to smart for its own good. Lots of style, probably lots of substance but it forgot one thing: an intelligible story. One second they're going on about inversed time travel, then some forged piece of artwork, then some lady trying leave her husband. For the first hour I was debating getting up and leaving because I've seen enough vague mystery box movies to know it never ends well.People are going to say it's awesome because they'll think they have to. A lot of people praised the last two Star Wars movies because they were told to. But this is by far Christopher Nolan's worst movie.But it looks great. That's what matters, right?"
279,"I was surprised to see it playing here in Korea but I took the risk and went to my local theater.
The trailer reveals the stakes involved so I am not giving much away but I will say this I didn't feel a lot of tension based on those stakes. My attention was mostly focused on the developing story rather than having any time to process the dire consequences of our protagonist's possible failure. The plot can be overwhelming and confusing at times. A lot of the exposition happens in quick conversations so important details are easy to miss. Although, the movie doesn't honestly require you to understand everything to enjoy it. I didn't experience irritation over my confusion. I allowed the movie to take me along it's journey.
Kenneth Branagh had a difficult role in playing the ""ultimate"" villain. In my opinion, his character was a weak-point of the movie. His motivation seemed unbelievable to me. There wasn't a lot of time spent developing his character to make his intentions believable. I think the same goes with all the characters really.
I will say that I was not bored in the least throughout the whole runtime. It definitely is an engaging movie but one that could've benefit from more time fleshing out the characters which would've made the stakes seem higher and elevated the movie.
I did like it enough to know that I will re-watch it at some point (mostly to pick up the finer confusing details) but I may wait until there is a streaming release for it."
280,"I do not know all of this movie - because I could not bear watching it all the way.
The plot is utter nonsenes, and not in a good way. Why Michael Caine signed up for this will forever be the greatest mystery about this piece. Ms. Debicki and Mr. Branagh perform poorly, perhaps to adapt to the plot."
281,"For the last 25 years, Holywood has been degrading gradually but surely. There is no more fine, tasty, refined, precise art. There is no more real narrative, real acting, real delight and delight ... .All that is left is the disintegration of time on the movie screen. The film is simple bad....And yes I get it,no need to watch it twice."
282,"Not a proper concept, not even logical or believable, please don't compare it with inception, very messy, poorly acted and implemented with dull storyline."
283,"Complex plot, well acted, well filmed & edited, great music - apart from the utter gash that plays over the end credits.The dialogue is completely unintelligible. The music is either so loud you can't hear what's being said or the characters are mumbling or they're wearing a mask. Most of the time, all three.I'll buy it on disc just for the subtitles. Ah, maybe that's why the dialogue sounds so awful: profit."
284,Don't get me wrong... I was extremely confused... broke down what I watched and then formulated my opinion and it was damn incredible.
285,"I will never get those hours back!
I like a complicated movie but I shouldn't have to get high to keep up and follow it. Then when you finally get most of the movie, it dawns on you that you could have found better things to do with your time😂"
286,"Let me start by saying that all the cast and crew including Nolan, worked very hard and did great work on making a movie. Take any scene by itself, and it is acted, directed, and overall, made very well.With that being said this movie was trying to be confusing. There were interesting sequences, and twists, but it was all too much.Apparently actors weren't allowed to read the script outside of a locked supervised area. Michael Caine, who has worked with Christopher Nolan on most of his movies, was only given his section of the script.I understand the need for secrecy for big budget movies, but some of the actors in the film didn't even know what the movie was about. When you have a movie written this complicated, it's almost as if he's trying to make it that way intentionally. I think that took away from the experience for me.It's not that I didn't understand it, and will probably notice more if I watch it again. It was well directed and had some great visual and action sequences, but I simply didn't enjoy this movie.I mean in the end, after all the hard work it takes to make a great movie, isn't the intention for the viewer to enjoy the experience? I know some movies are made to be the exception to that rule, but good movies, that aren't a fun experience, are made that way intentionally, like Requiem for a Dream. This was just complicated for the sake of being complicated, and the intense visuals and action didn't make up for that.Take 1917 for example, it was edited to make it look like one long take (with a minor exception) but that enhanced the experience.Inception was the last attempt from Nolan to make a complicated, multi-layered story. Now that people have dissected that to death, there are questions that only Nolan knows the answer to, and he made it that way. Nolan follows the code of Christian Bale's character from The Prestige. ""Don't give away the secret or it won't be special anymore"" ...I'm paraphrasing but you get the point.The big argument here that people who loved the movie will say is, ""you didn't understand it."" That's not always the case, and I hate that argument because not all complicated, or twisted movies are good.We all know that Christopher Nolan can make a good movie that's not overly complicated. Most of us know Nolan brings his A game when it comes to making movies (with maybe one exception). So why this twisted knot of a story? Inception, after repeat viewings is full of Easter eggs, and a lot of attention to detail was put in to making it, not just Nolan pulling a fast one (which he never does anyway). However there are a lot of times the movie breaks it's own rules.Christopher Nolan is a genius filmmaker, and a great writer, but he's human, and fallible. It just seems like when he's directing something he's written, he uses complex plot and secrecy to cover for any short comings.If you enjoyed the film, great! I did not. I won't even go as far as saying this was a bad movie. I just didn't enjoy watching it. Interstellar was brilliantly made as well and I didn't enjoy that either, there were, again, sequences I enjoyed but didn't like it as a whole.I'd just love to see Christopher Nolan make a movie without relying on an overly complex plot (with the exception of Dunkirk, or movies based on real events)Also, Memento didn't have an overly complex plot. It was just edited cleverly, and some key details are left ambiguous (much like any Nolan movie), however if you pay close enough attention, you can guess what Leonard's real backstory is.I know I'm probably the odd man out here, and I'm truly glad if you enjoyed the movie. For me this one wasn't enjoyable enough to make me want to dissect it like his other puzzle box movies."
287,"Visually, this is a spectacular film. That's where the three stars come from. Other than that, this film is a car crash. For starters, I missed about half of the dialogue for a number of reasons. Sometimes it was because the score was too loud. Sometimes it was because the characters were wearing masks. Sometimes it was because the actors were mumbling (I'm looking at you Kenneth Branagh). Whatever it was, I had no idea what they were saying too often. And in a film this convoluted, hearing what is being said is pretty important.This leads me on to the narrative itself. I was lost after about half an hour. The concept is complicated and the scene that explains it doesn't really explain it all. Not clearly. Then things happen but it's not very clear why. Then some characters turn up with no explanation or introduction, then disappear again with no explanation. Things happen but I don't know why. Objects got inverted in the future but I'm not clear why that's the case. That could be because a character mumbled it or I'd stopped caring and lost the will to live and missed it. And frankly, after an hour, I didn't care what was happening or who survived or died.This film reminds me of Interstellar, which was also overly complicated and the dialogue muffled by an absurdly loud score. I'm beginning to feel like Christopher Nolan is aware that his time related films are really not very good and tries to stun us with sound and visuals to make us think we've watched a good film because he's the well respected Christopher Nolan so we're ""supposed"" to enjoy it. A poor effort after the triumphant Dunkirk.As a side note, I've noticed a lot of reviews saying you need to watch this more than once. If that's the case, then that defies the point of a film in my opinion. Why make a film that you need to watch more than once to get it? And I don't mean to pick up on some clever details. I mean to actually understand THE ENTIRE PLOT. I feel that Nolan is becoming arrogant as his reputation grows and that's not a good thing."
288,"Why? Volume!
In the last 5-10 years I feel cinema volume has been too low.
This was unacceptably high and Nolan should be fined for creating this health risk. Yes, he decided how loud it should play at your cinema.
I am not ready to review this movie for it's content. It's been TWO MONTHS since i saw it and it is still ringing DAILY in my ears.
So, since I'll probably never experience a quiet moment again for the rest of my life; Christopher Nolan: F.U."
289,"Nolan turned the dial up to 11....except Washington whispers through.He's completely emotionless, with such dry delivery it's astounding to me he has an acting career.The film is overtly complex and becomes a caricature of its Nolan-ness"
290,"Just going through the comments and pretty much all of them are saying ""audio is bad"", ""confusing as hell"", ""bad acting"", ""worst Nolan film"", etc. If I'm being completely honest, this WAS part of my reaction after the first watch. But after the second watch, this movie has just proven to be one of my top three Nolan films. IT IS, LITERALLY, A MASTERPIECE. The audio was spot on (seriously) because it created so much intensity and strength to the whole film. Some actors are hiding some information in some scenes (no spoilers) so it looks like they aren't great actors. However, it is because they are hinting the viewers which inversion phase they're in. Yes, I know it is confusing, that's just because each character has different inversion phase. You just have to watch it multiple time for everything to click in your head. There are timeline graphs for each character on the Internet. Look into it, watch the film again, and re-rate this movie, PLEASE.THIS MOVIE SERIOUSLY DESERVES A WAY HIGHER RATING."
291,Why ?? Why ? Why ????Worst movie ever made in the history.
292,"It was suffering. Long beyond understanding and utterly silly script, Also, a toilet seat has more charisma than Washington and Pattinson combined. Avoid and save yourself from hours of boredom."
293,"This was the first film I watched coming back into the movie theater during the pandemic. I absolutely love Christopher Nolan as a filmmaker, and always look forward ot his films. However I will admit this film was just not it for me. I loved and appreciated the interesting and new story concept but I had no idea what was happening. I recommend this film, and still need to go back to the theater to watch this film twice."
294,"Tenet isn't a bad movie, but it's a very long way from being a great one.
It's your basic action adventure with a lot of busy work and going places to achieve goals so the Protagonist can get to the main bad guy ( a rare phoned in performance by Kenneth Branagh ). The time travel narrative feels a bit superfluous, something added so that forwards/backwards special effects could work but it isn't really explored in detail. The acting is just about OK with the exception of Robert Paterson who steals every scene he's in. The characters are 2 dimensional at best and it's difficult to invest in any of them which makes it hard to care what happens to them. Oh and it way over long, at least 30 minutes could be cut and the movie would be better for it."
295,"First of all, respect to Nolan for trying something new.
But the concept is inherently incomprehensible and sooner or later you will check out and be frustrated by all this nonsense.The actors are all giving their best.
The score is good too but seems to have been made for a completely different movie. But at least it is so loud it prevents you from falling asleep.First ""Love is the answer!"" now ""TED Talk, The Movie"".
Nolan does not care for the audience anymore.
And I don't care about Nolan anymore.
Sad!"
296,"The concept is great with some twists here and there, but the storyline was just bad with on top of that couple actors that couldn't even act in this movie.Only if it had been a better story with better actors. It's definitely not better than inception or his other movies. It was very empty with lots of talks."
297,"If you're a fan of FOLLOWING and MEMENTO, you are going to be sorely disappointed with Mr. Nolan's latest effort. Likely the only person who understands what is happening in this film is Nolan...in his head...while he was writing it. Sadly he was unable to covey it on screen. Perhaps he realized it after editing since he overcompensated by cranking up the background music so loud, you'd be forgiven if you thought you were watching a 150 minute Whitesnake music video."
298,What more you expect from a genius? Christopher Nolan movies are not for dumbs even the wise ones need 2-3 viewings before they fully grasp of the happenings. Masterpiece after Interstellar worth risking myself to go watch in theatre in this mess
299,"I enjoyed the film for its ability to make you think. Honestly this isn't for the casual viewer. I enjoy Nolan's flim in that way that all that you see is never what it is. This film for me really took cinematography and capture to the next level. The rawness and realistic visuals were unmatched to anything I've seen to date. Watching I just thought, how much meticulous work it must have taken from inception (lol pun intended) to execution to make it all happen in reverse order. 2. The paradox of future vs past and time being non-linear.
The one down side was the dialogue was sometimes hard to hear. I'll admit I enjoyed the action and the story line but parts where an explanation of what was happening or going to happen was explained in very turbulent settings. So you kind of had to assume what was going on or just ignore parts of the story and just sit back and enjoy the visuals and action. The cast was amazing as well! Happy to see Mr. Washington lead at the fore front of the story and not as a supporting role. But I did keep thinking about his character in Ballers and also some facial expressions and mannerisms he's definitely picked up from his pops! All in all, I'll definitely see it again either in the theater or at home (with subtitles). :)"
300,"30 min into watching this movie I turned to one of my mates sitting next to me and I asked him ""Do you understand any of this yet?""
With a tone of relief he replied ""Thank god I'm not the only one.. I understand precisely nothing.""
We all walked out stunned, amazed and absolutely wanting to see it again.
In the end I had to see it 3 times to get it fully, no shame in that.
Besides a great cast and delightful acting it contains more than one interesting idea and they are implemented very smartly. The story is complex but has strong dramatic moments (which left me teared up in the end) and an intense soundtrack that wonderfully fits the theme of time and twisted physics.Why are people giving bad reviews based on a feeling of insult due to not understanding it instantly? You can research or re-view it you know.How many times have you wished to forget an amazing movie because you wanted to see it again for the first time? This is not exactly that - it is rather a movie you can enjoy multiple times because each time you get it more and more. It's a quality that should not warrant an angry kid's response!I know this isn't a typical review and I am far from a Nolan fanboy. I just read some of the reviews and I couldn't fathom why they gave sometimes 4 or 5 stars.. And the only reason I could read out of their reviews was ""I didn't understand it right away and now I feel stupid which makes me mad."" People simultaneously seem to expect Nolan to blow them away yet under no circumstance should they have to use their brain more than when they watch friends.
So yeah I just wanted to let you know that most of the bad reviews have 0% reason and 100% low character behind it."
301,THATS ALL MY TITLE IS FOR THIS REVIEW GARBAGE MOVIE!!!!!!!! THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS HAPPENING IS IF YOU WHERE A CHARACTER IN THE MOVIE!!!! ALL IT WAS RANDOM SCENES WITH NO SUBSTANCE AND ALL OVER THE PLACE!!!! ONE OF THE ONLY THING I UNDERSTOOD ABOUT THIS GARBAGE MOVIE WAS THAT IT WAS A LOVE STORY!!!!! THE MAIN GUY SOUNDED SO BORING DURING THE MOVIE!!!!!! THE ONLY GOOD THINGS I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS MOVIE WAS THE SOUNDTRACK AND IT WASNT PC AT ALL!!! I GURANTEE YOU CHRISTOPHER NOLAN COULDNT EXPLAIN THIS PILE OF CRAP!!! I HATE ANYONE THAT GIVES THIS PILE OF CRAP ANY RATING ABOVE A 1 STAR!!! YES I TYPED IN ALL CAPS CAUSE THATS HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS HOT GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!! IVE NEVER BEEN MAD ABOUT A MOVIE BEFORE!!!!! AND NO YOU DONT NEED TO WATCH IT MORE THAN ONCE CAUSE ITS GARBAGE BOTH TIMES YOU WATCH IT!!!!! I'm not sure if it was the extra loud volume that made me extra mad but either way I'm still mad that it was so garbage.
302,"I've seen a lot of hate for Tenet, but I honestly believe the movie will age very well, and a lot of the people who hate it now will come to realize just how ahead of its time it is. I will admit that it prioritizes concept over plot and character, and hard-to-hear dialogue has become a recurring problem for Nolan. But the movie is great, and I like it more the more I think about it. You don't need to be super smart to understand it, as some diehard Nolan fans claim, but I believe you do need to be fascinated enough by the philosophy of time to make it a pleasant experience. Without that, I think the movie will bore you and that boredom will probably lead you to miss some key points needed to fill in the puzzle. Filling in the puzzle doesn't mean you'll like it though, because this movie is an experimental thriller disguised as a blockbuster, which is not what people expected.Hey, maybe I'm wrong, but I expect the love for this movie will grow over the years."
303,"This movie full fill the expectations,
This is not a master piece of Christopher Nolan,
This movie awesome but something missing, I am a biggest fan of Christopher Nolan"
304,"It's a shame because I usually enjoy Christopher Nolan's movies - but the issue with Tenet is that the story is overly complex & probably requires another viewing just to get a basic understanding. Specifically:1 The concept makes sense - but the way it was integrated into the story was confusing. The scenes also didn't flow. It felt like random scenes were cut & pasted into 1 movie.2 The dialogue was tricky to follow as everyone was mumbling.3 I didn't care for any of the characters, so I also didn't care about the outcome. I also don't feel intrigued to read up on it or watch it again.After an hour of trying to understand - I just stopped listening and started to admire the scenery. I would have slept if not for the fact that I didn't want my friends to find me sleeping."
305,"I will let other people comment on Mr. Nolan's construction, time-folds and plotting; the conservatism in genre (excepting the time-wrinkle this is a James Bond-film writ large with all the sharp suits, Yachts, exotic locales (shot like tourist attraction footage), sport-cars, fist and gun fights that goes with it, the motivation for the bad guys is also standard: Humanity screwed up so lets do something really bad); Washington, Pattinson and Debicki's performances and the villain with Rosa Klebb's accent and Khal Drogo's penchant for talking about the violent things he will be doing while killing someone (Kenneth Branagh). And last but not least the pulsating action sequences, two of which I found interesting: The first one occurs twice in the film but with evolved stakes and a different perspective the second time, and the second involves one place but two ""flows"" inverted from each other (the highway chase-sequence should also get a mention, but that one doesnt escape the image-tropes of similiar scenes in other films).Other things:A lot of people are finding it messy and hard to follow, and I am sympathetic to that viewpoint. But Nolan urges experience/immersion rather than a literal ""pick this apart-attitude"": ""Don't think about it, just feel it"" (paraphrased) a character tells us. Another time Robert Pattinson asks our audience surrogate Washington if he's fallen asleep yet from his ramblings on time inversion and entropy, so Nolan's feelings on the matter is clear. It's confident, but also contradictory considering the talky, expository scenes that he retains in the finished product.As for the lack of humanity or ""heart"" that is being remarked upon, well it's semi-true. There is a half-hearted attempt at some kind of emotional core involving a parent and child (Nolan's MO) that must not be separated (does he feel monstrous like our villain? Does he feel like he has kept his wife from seeing their children too much?), but he has done better at least once but probably twice or thrice. It's a shame he feels that he apparently must have these elements even though at times it feels like he'd gladly forgo them: Many great films have been made without necessarily having characters that you ""care for"" (The opposite is also true off course: Lots of great films where the whole point is that you are concerned and care). But Chris seems unsure at times and so is kind of hit and miss with his integrations.One element I did like was the in-world-foreshadowing with regards to the inversions, usually involving broken glass: The effect comes before the cause, so our characters can understand and figure it out (which they do, and do not). Usually foreshadowing comes in the form of subliminals and signs meant for us: we see something the characters don't and we watch it pay off down the road. Here it becomes part of the world (and story) itself.One can also think of this as Nolan's attempt to save cinema; both in the sense of theatrical experience (He has been a bit up in arms in the past about Netflix, about films migrating to streaming services and audiences primarily watching films at home). So he makes this as a counter move, delivering excess and spectacle both old (Bond/spy) and new (the time-factor) which undoubtedly is best enjoyed and seen on the largest screen possible. Add to that: The pandemic hit, and now his champion must not only save cinema, but also resurrect the cash flow. He probably sees this as an equally important mission as the one the characters are trying to solve in the film proper.Last thing: Okay, so the protagonist is called ""Protagonist"" and why will only be clear later on. I thought about it this way: We have our audience surrogate in Washington that gets dropped into a world of espionage and time-foolery, but unlike say a Neo or a Luke Skywalker the point is not for him to go thorugh an arc in the usual sense (hardship, meet the mentor, right the wrongs, overcome advserity, blow up the thingamabob etc. But to simply go through the timeline layed out by the films strucutre and arrive at the moment where it's revealed to himself (and us) that he was ""the one that matters"" all along I.e. Protagonist. Not sure what to think about this, but it was defintely not the smart choice--judging from all the comments I've read--if Nolan wanted his audience to ""connect"" with his main character in an ordinary manner.Overall, this is a fine film from an interesting filmmaker that also works on a big budget. It's hardly his best; Previously, he has located the heart where it matters properly (""Inception""), disoriented without feeling sloppy (""Dunkirk"") or infused his concerns and thematics into more clever frameworks than a time-travelling Bond-formula (""Memento"" (photographs, memory, writing on the skin) and ""The Prestige"" (duelling artists/magicians, devotion to art vs perversion of it etc)).Will this grow on me with repeat-viewings? Will the concept, the craft, what he leaves out (in many ways this is only a slice of the story, intentionally so) be enough? Or will it sink like many loud, fast moving, excessive movies do with time? Will the choppy assembly, boring characters, cartoonish writing, retro-silliness and focus on spectacle overwhelm?"
306,"I'd like to focus on the main criticism of this movie: the complexity.With movies like this you shouldn't be afraid to not understand something at first, because it'll all become more clear later on. That's also why, for example, the music intentionally gets reletively loud sometimes - it's to show that it's not important to follow everything that's being said at some segment. Nolan uses tricks like these all the time throughout the movie, but you do need to be able to use them to your advantage to enjoy the movie.Sometimes you'd forget that we live in a three-dimensional world, and that it's just not our nature to comprehence the 4th time dimension. This movie does a fenominal job at visualizing this dimension, just like inception did at explaining dreams in dreams in dreams..., also known as inception.I only watched the movie once, and will again. That's the power of this movie."
307,"I have a huge amount of respect for director Christopher Nolan. His recent films Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk are three of the best things I've ever seen on film and I automatically want to see whatever new production he comes out with. So, I'm just back from the theater having seen Tenet for the first time (I'm pretty sure there will be a second and third time) and in one sense I have no idea what rating to give. At a minimum it would be worth at least 6/10 for its technical quality alone. But it might be 10/10 for the quality of its fiendishly intricate storyline, which leaves your head spinning by the end. But it' s not without a few problems (see below). So, OK -- 8/10 it is.Among Nolan's previous works I'd say 'Tenet' owes the most to 'Inception' for its complex, ever-shifting, multilayered plot. For Inception it was the Russian-doll dreamworlds within dreamworlds. For Tenet, it's playing with time and time reversal (as you see from any trailer or synopsis out there). We've had any number of time-travel movies before, and one sure thing they're good for is setting up paradoxes, but the way Nolan deploys this on screen is at times genuinely and startlingly new (as just one example, there's a car chase on a busy freeway where one car is speeding backwards but time-reversed, so from its POV it's racing forward, which is why it can travel that fast driving backward ... and there are many more scenes that I won't spoil.) There are things here we've never seen on screen before.In the barest of bare-bones summary, the plot is all about a hunt for The Algorithm, something that enables this messing with the timeline The uber-evil Andrei (Kenneth Branagh) aims to use it to start WW III, or even (in a total burst of nihilism) ring down the curtain on all of reality. The shadowy team called Tenet aims to stop this. Keep up with it if you can. On the surface, it's an excellent James Bond imitation. Exposition scenes are followed by thunderous action, rinse, repeat -- pretty much from start to finish. How confused you are at any given moment depends (like Inception) on how many questions are running through your mind: why are we in THIS location now, who's doing what to whom, and what precisely are the characters after? The overall impression, though (again, like Inception) is that there IS substance underneath the high-octane surface and that repeated viewings and study will bring it out. We'll see.So the production quality is, as usual for Nolan, first-rate. There are big, bravura scenes (wait till you see the big opener in a concert hall) but plenty of close, person-to-person ones to balance. One thing that might be a little jarring is that the scene-to-scene transitions are extremely abrupt and extremely frequent, and I assume that's deliberate -- there's no time for viewers to think even if we want to. But I'll accept that as a feature rather than a bug. The overall flow isn't necessarily helped by the music score (by Ludwig Goransson), which is epic but also insistent and omnipresent. Too much of a good thing. Lots of the personal scenes would just have worked better for me with no background score stepping on the dialog.For the acting: I thought John David Washington (as The Protagonist) was OK but rather wooden, and he's on screen most of the time. I kept visualizing Will Smith in the part instead -- but maybe he'd have taken over the movie too much and that's not the result Nolan wanted? I don't know. But I liked Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki quite a lot. They both have substantial, essential roles and they have more nuance and humanity than anything they've done before. Kenneth Branagh still can't do a good Russian accent (though to be fair, not many native-English actors can) and although he's fine, I think as an actor he's much better suited to Shakespeare or Hercule Poirot. There's a big cast of smaller roles (among which is the always-welcome Michael Caine), adding to the difficulty of keeping up with what's developing.So there it is. I'm looking forward to figuring out more of what's under the hood of this thing."
308,To see a African-American man in the lead role of this big budget movie is a beautiful thing and he did his thing this movie is a mixture of James Bond Bourne identity and mission impossible with the feel of inception Black Panther was great but this movie having an African-American lead to me feels just as big if not bigger but just like inception you're going to need to see it 2-3 times. That'sa good thing
309,"I don't get the hate, I can understand it's hard to follow, but the plot, sound and visuals are freaking amazing. U realise ure warching a Nolan film from the very beginning and the actors are perfectly chosen, really liked it"
310,"Nolan is visionary, but this was nonsense. I love spy movies, time travel movies, action movies, etc... but damn this was jus convoluted bs. Very disappointed"
311,"The film is a bit complicated, but in terms of filming music, the action scenes and the story of the film are very extraordinary, and you better see and enjoy it for yourself."
312,"I watched half of it because there was nothing left to watch. I didn't care about the characters. I didn't care about the premise. I didn't care about the actors as they all played the usual roles that they always play. (Enigmatic Pattisson. Damsel in distress Elizabeth Debicki. Alfred/ Michael Caine.). The story is of no consequence and felt no urgency to know what the ending would be, so much so, that I didn't finish the movie. I gave it a five star because of the cinematography. As a big fan of Nolan, this wasn't very good. On the same level as Dunkirk in the category of,, ""Why was this movie made/"""
313,"Here's how bad this movie was.I recently watched Jiu Jitsu ""staring"" Nick Cage. I was able to somehow watch that one to the end.I was not able to do so with Tenet last night. Fell asleep 3x, rewinded, realized the rewinding was a waste of time and decided to just turn it off with about 20 minutes of show left. I have no desire to learn how the movie ended.My summary of the movie: Black dude with impressive beard wears fancy suits and does some random action scenes that always end with you trying to figure out just why the heck that just made sense to someone to put it into a movie. Dialog is abysmal, generic ""Russian"" bad guys etc. ""Fancy"" special effects of time reversal I was able to do back in high school in the early 80's using 8mm film."
314,"I'm not sure I understood what this film was about. Normally that would make me feel very frustrated and filled with self-loathing. However, I also realized that I did not care what this film was about.I still think you should see movies the way they are meant to be seen: on a big screen in a theater within an audience of strangers (albeit for now, socially-distanced strangers). In an arduous if rather pointless demonstration of this belief, I sat through this whole thing, including the closing credits. When you get that special chance to go out and see a movie for the first time since the coronavirus lockdown, don't make the same mistake I did."
315,"First of all, this movie was overly complex and too complicated. I've seen every Nolan film and loved them all, but this was by far his worst. It was clearly made to be digested more than once, but if I'm going to do that, I usually have to enjoy it the first time around. There are important plot points that are explained only once, and sometimes with the dialogue drowned out by the music and lost in the mix.It starts off with an action sequence, which is a problem for me right away. How am I supposed to feel a sense of danger for these people, before I am even emotionally invested in any characters? And it doesn't get any better. There is no character development or arcs to speak of. The film is just a series of action sequences and dialogue interactions, with very little emotion or drama. It's hard to care about a couple of guys trying to save the world, when the film's world is so void of life and feeling.The whole premise of the film is just an excuse for some trippy action sequences, like Inception. While they were very cool and well executed, the problems were being constantly confused with why they were doing what they were doing, and why I should care.The music was amazing, as always (despite not working with Hans Zimmer this time), but obviously not enough to save an over-complicated and lifeless screenplay. I really appreciate Christopher Nolan, and the fact that he has the ability to make such high budget blockbusters for the thinking person, but I did not enjoy the ride, and I came so close to giving up on it and walking out."
316,"Pretensious Rubbish
Reminds me of the "" Emperor's New Clothes"" !!
The director (whoever he is) thinks he's much too clever for the audience.
It's totally incomprehensible to me.
I have an IQ of only 140 and I am 75 y.o
So that maybe that's my problem.
But I do have some understanding of Entropy which basically is simple,but this film seems to build a whole new concept around it,which technically is impossible.
That's fair enough in a sci fi film ,but I couldn't even enjoy it for its entertainment content, Since due to terrible incoherent speech and excessive sound volume. Mind you if it hadn't been for the Noise, I probably would have fallen asleep with boredom !
I don't always object to loud noise in its place,,,, Dunkirk was a fantastic film and very noisy .(Must have had a better director)
I certainly will not waste another 2½ hours of my life watching it again to see if I can make it more decipherable."
317,"You won't find a single word even in Oxford dictionary to express how the movie is or I can say its unexpressive.... just go and feel the experience on big screen that's it..
As always this man makes a fictional or over the top story so believable and so close to the reality that you are forced to believe that it can happen... that is ""Christopher nolon"" the born genius.
I will not reveal the story at all as I said earlier this is not a movie this is an experience for big screen viewing so go with your family and friends and enjoy life time experience of movie making you won't be disappointed.
9.5 🌟"
318,"ReVeRsE eNtRoPy miss me with that bs. Nolan saw that time travel was the IT thing in the movie/tv show industry right now so he thought he'd milk that cow too (and pretentiously thought to coin a new term for it: reverse entropy *massive aye roll*). Probably watched Dark before writing this one.
The movie fails to build interest. I sat through it all I don't know what was the point of any scene, any dialogue (which was a struggle to hear btw). What are they fighting against? Why? How is the story progressing? Why's he in India now? Why's he in a desert now? How did he know who to meet here (oh his future self sent people back here to tell him who to meet *eye roll*).Nolan needs to know that being complex is not always a good thing. This was so far fetched it became dumb. And uninteresting. I'm pretty sure half the people claiming to like this one are doing it to seem ""smart"" and complicated and nolany. Meh."
319,"You'll better appreciate time's value after wasting 2 and a half hours for watching this travesty of a movie!A sci-fi movie succeeds as long as it sets it's characters and their motivations against a clearly explained premise, and then sticks to the rules of it's premise. Tenet achieves none of the above, gradually spiraling out of relevance and consistency as the time goes by.The time travel/ inversion/ parallel universe gimmick is extremely poorly explained for the audience, but it is also presented inconsistently since it is not following the rules set up by the filmmakers. What is more frustrating however, is the fact that there are no fleshed out characters and motivations, so the audience doesn't root for anyone or anything happening onscreen. it's just an excuse for a loud boring inverted fireworks show.Don't underestimate your intelligence by thinking this movie needs a second viewing to comprehend. It's just a mess that will make you regret watching it even once."
320,"Firstly, I never write reviews on IMDb and I absolutely adore everything Christopher Nolan has ever done.I'm sure the plot is great, and the cinematography is awesome etc, but none of that matters if you can't hear anything anybody is saying, which is true of this movie.It doesn't matter about anything else, if the sound mixing is so bad that you can't hear the dialogue - it's just a bad film.If it's a stylistic design choice, it's the wrong one. It's ruined the movie.Utterly disappointed. I would say don't bother paying to go and see it until they accept that they need to sort the sound out."
321,"Whilst this Nolan film is technically 'epic', it left me underwhelmed much more.
Conceptually, the premise is solid, however without going into chapter and verse, it seems like Nolan tried to 'outNolan' himself.
The script lacks character development, it arbitrarily seems to jump all over the place, without the finesse of a Bourne plot.
Rather than guide you through I felt like the action scenes were my adrenaline shots to make up for forgettable and poorly handked script.I know most will suggest that I rewatch to understand the detail, the nuances - I might be odd but I rewatch movies because I loved them, the journey was extraordinary - not rewatch to understand it.Two of my absolute, all time favourite movies are 'Interstellar' and 'Inception' - sadly Tenet is not."
322,"Nolan takes on a fascinating concept but it's executed in such a way that if you don't have the benefit of prior knowledge, it's confusing, not to mention hard to hear A LOT of the dialogue due to masks, music and mumbling. Performances were strong but some of the writing was too on the nose and then not enough. He's onto something big here but misses the mark by a long shot. Unfortunately, the confusion makes word of mouth a risky proposition if only to encourage potential viewers to see if they can figure it out. Even though the film will definitely start conversations, the fans I was with (including myself) were unable to build a case strong enough in defence of their understanding of the movie. Big disappointment. I will not pay to see this movie twice, or, according to the story, did I pay twice already?"
323,"I never leave reviews, but this is a terrible film! Too loud, the plot is ridiculous, characters are hollow and dialogues are silly.I love Nolan's films, but this is a waste of time."
324,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. I wanted the main bad guy to murder everyone towards the end of the film, as everyone else was so irritating. The woman was unattractive and difficult to look at. The two male leads were horribly miscast. The concept of inversion, communicated by people running backgrounds was so dumb I could not suspend my disbelief. The movie was loud therefore I could not hear anyone saying their lines. The set design was boring. There were no redeeming qualities for this film. It was truly awful.I am quite sure the high scores must either be fake or crazy. I don't know if we even went to see the same film."
325,"You want to love this movie because the mean idea of reverse time actions is fascinating, but you can't because of : bad rhythm in dialogues (very fast talking with no pause or emotions), as the music not appropriate for the moment and inappropriately loud al the time, dialogues are very bad, repetitive and pathetic, personages are all only male very matchist with no intellect, working on instinct with only one woman who is pathetically very weak, fragile, depressed and can do nothing getting beaten by her husband (like the Middle Age princess). Very very disappointing...
Is it the worse than Interstaallar ? No Interstallar is worse..."
326,"I am kinda disappointed with Tenet.First half is a pretty lame james bond spy thing (blond bond girl included), second half is just the characters time traveling to the past to fix the future. That's it!There is no point going deeper into it.Nolan just added a ""rewind"" gimmick while the characters time travel to the past. This is the only thing that makes this movie different. Take out this gimmick and you realize how thin and cliche the main story is.I am sorry to say but I did not like the lead actor. His presence was dull.Wow!! The movie had a budget of 200,000,000!! Unbelievable!!"
327,"Overrated movie cause of it's unique system of traveling to past.Everyone getting out of hand saying its the theatre saviour.Music and bass way too loud and same tone which keep u intense throughout whole boring fighting scene that get u tiring.
What is the main purpose when the cinema was create?Is to enjoy the art of the movie, not to freak out my brain to put every broken piece together. Most of the thing done not convincing due to the actor personality. First 1 hrs still OK, and start to become dragging along the way.
Most of the story plot got flaws and yet most of the film critic try to cover the flaws and make many kind of explanation. I feel is the director fault if u can't make audience to understand in a 2hr 30 min movie and still had to waste money to see again to understand how the system works. My head hurts after half way through so decided to take a nap hoping this is a dream overlap dream."
328,"While Memento and Inception were challenging to follow, I enthusiastically engaged, and enjoyed them both thoroughly. After viewing Tenet, I wondered if my IQ, as well as my hearing had declined drastically over the last ten years.It is heartening to read the other reviews here that substantiate my initial impression that this film was nonsensical and pretentious garbage, and that even those who claim to like it are hard-pressed to justify it."
329,"This is not science fiction, it's the nonsensical rambling of a mad man who happens to be an idiot. One of the stupidest films ever created. There are no words to describe the idiocy of the plot.Just a boring, simplistic but extremely convoluted story. The people voting more than 3 are just kidding."
330,Being a physicist myself I increasingly got frustrated with the plot -- to the point when I became angry. The story is ridiculous and inconsistent. If you want to be entertained by some action scenes stop watching after 35 minutes.... or go on a little bit longer if you enjoy the looks of the main very slim actress (which I did). Don't waste an additional two hours of your lifetime to watch any further; you will most certainly regret this.
331,"Tenet's main flaw is it simply isn't long enough; for a film as audacious as this, biting off far more than it can chew in a meager 2 hours & 30 minutes, it's clear Christopher Nolan (despite being one of the most remarkable filmmakers working in the industry at the moment) had an impossible task on his hands. However, that doesn't stop him from boldly trying & despite its pacing issues / questionable editing, he still manages to make a phenomenal movie - which is a triumph in both storytelling & technical filmmaking - boasting some truly extraordinary cinematography from long time collaborator, Hoyte Van Hoytema, who captures images with such effectiveness, it's hard not to be impressed by the accomplished result from their $225m attempt.However, this is a project - more than most - which is yearning for an extended director's cut. Emphasizing the point, it frankly necessitates one - that could easily boost its box office numbers if it's re-released in theatres once the pandemic has finally concluded. The vast majority of issues with the feature stem from the fact that characters are severely underdeveloped & scenes are constantly rushing from one set piece to another - with little connective tissue between the sequences to help hold them together. Hence, considering the sheer amount of vital information / exposition Nolan needed to remain in his blockbuster - in order for it to make narrative sense, it's not hard to believe those quieter, character driven moments would've been the first to fall on the cutting room floor, providing extra time for Chris to explore the scientific / philosophical theories he aimed to tackle instead - accounting for the lack of strong foundations in terms of both character & emotional engagement. Adding those back in would undoubtedly improve its quality.However, I fail to sympathise with those who proclaimed they didn't get it or couldn't hear anything... Growing up watching time travel shows like Doctor Who & having fascinated over concepts like free will / causality, this seemed pretty familiar in that regard - so despite its convoluted-ness, the intricacies are detailed enough for people to comprehend - as long as they bother to pay close attention. As for the sound, no complaints either."
332,"This movie has awesome visuals and a great sound. It is a bit too loud but that is not the biggest problem. Storyline is very confusing and honestly, I got very tired towards the end of the movie. I wanted the movie to finish asap. This is not even close to Interstellar and Inception and I put this movie a 4 out of 10, same as Dunkirk. Last 2 Nolan's movies are very confusing and disappointing for me."
333,"You know, when Nolan finally bought into his own hype, I had fully expected him to create a story that was completely and utterly incomprehensible. What I didn't expect was that that descriptor would also apply to the dialogue. I understood maybe 40% max of the actual, literal words being spoken, but I'm fairly confident that even if that wasn't the case, this would still be more unintelligible than the ramblings of a stoned philosophy major."
334,"In typical fashion it's been executed well. The sound was loud at the beginning and quieter around other parts but is likely to do with the cinema I saw it at. Was a brilliant story, didn't give much time for the viewer to process the plausibility of what's happening a lot like inception with enough 'depth/layers' to the plot much like inception to see it a second time. And I'm sure you'll pick up on thing last you missed the first time."
335,"Ten minutes in I thought ""this will probably make sense soon"". Thirty minutes in it's getting harder to follow but any time soon all will be made clear. An hour in ""I would be impressed if this will all make sense any time sooner or later"". One and a half hour later my brain gave up trying to make any sense of it all but ""the end of the movie is probably near"". This torture remains for faaaaaaar to long. And please turn down the volume and get the sound right on the dialogue - or maybe they turned the down dialogue down because it makes no sense anyway."
336,"I love Nolan. Interstellar was one of the more incredible cinematic experiences I've ever witnessed in a movie theater. I really, really, really didn't like this one.A good idea and the film stops there; it's just a good idea. The execution is visually thrilling, but story-wise is boring, with no clear goals (despite the seemingly endless exposition) and with almost no characters with enough characterization to care about. I found myself very disinterested, especially when all the bombastic action was happening and I had no idea what was happening, who was fighting who and who was inverted or not.
I've never agreed with all the usual criticisms people have been throwing around his previous films. I agree with them now, for this one; boring, pretentious and too much exposition, which in this case leads to nowhere. At least his previous endeavors had characters with some kind of depth to care about (except for Dunkirk, but that was kind of the point).
My last point of criticism is that the soundtrack's mixing is way too loud. I've never noticed this in his previous works, but oh boy, was it intrusive! I had a literal headache at the end.I'm sure you reading this will be thinking something in the vein of ""you just didn't understand it"" or ""you didn't pay enough attention"". Think whatever the hell you want; the movie simply didn't convey information clearly enough. That's on Nolan, not the audience. And with no character to attach to (you're not making abstract art, Nolan!), I couldn't find myself interested enough to decipher the supposed puzzle. On second viewing this may change, but for now that's how I feel.So, these are my impressions on first viewing. I'll surely watch it again, once it will be released on Blu Ray and/or VOD. For now, it's a 5,5/10."
337,"I would probably appear really smart if I told you I completely understood and easily followed the story-line. Sadly, I was unable to detect any story of any kind. Fortunately, I was able to while away the hours with the help of Solitaire on my phone. I suppose I could categorize this as a ""Feel Good"" movie . . . It felt sooooo good when it was over . . ."
338,"That is movie can rate near an 8 is a testament to people who buy off on pretentiousness or, simply think the bow put on the end in the last five minutes makes for a good movie.IF, I could have understood the dialogue, or even most of it, I would say, ""hey, maybe I'm just not swift enough to follow a great, intellectual plot by the guy in charge."" However, many other posters note it wasn't just me. So, it is a movie that, by analogy, is like one of those travel reality series where you are in a strange land and have to have a map to solve the puzzle, only to find the map... the dialogue, is half missing.So, then you spend the rest of the movie knowing you are lost, and not a thing you can do about it. One of the worst efforts by what is supposed to be a smart, experienced movie maker I've seen if five decades of being a movie fan.And, to those satisfied by two hours of incomprehensible mis-mash tied up in a pretty bow the last few minutes of the movie... you get what you pay for next time in the movie business. More of that? Ugh."
339,"If you're afraid that you will not understand anything - do not be afraid; if your friends told you ""IT IS TOO HARD"" - do not trust them.
Tenet is ofc very well written, I am not really into physics or something, but I do not felt uncomfortable in the theater. So it doesn't feel like having troubles with physical facts and at the same time you don't feel ""stupid"". Easy understandable conception! Especially in the end it's like ""Oh, IT WAS VERY PREDICTABLE BUT STILL GOOD, NOW I UNDERSTAND""!
Yeap, I'm here just to say that Tenet is one of the best movies this year (not because we have like 2,5 new movies OK). If you still haven't watched it - do it rn! It's worthy.
What I want to notice: 1) It is not WITHOUT problems, f.e. sometimes there's no much ""chemistry"" between main characters /not robert pattinson, he was fantastic/.
2) IT IS FUNNY, ofc it's not comedy or something but you will smile during the film and after. (still laughing how they say ""we live in a twilight world"" and show robert)
3) It is VERY Nolan's film with, you know, a lot of thighs to think about; great visual effects; great music; all the views were just fantastic.Do not try to understand it. Feel it))0)"
340,"Thanks Nolan. Most people are tired of the same old dumbed down scripts and comic books.This movie will guaranteed blow, if not stretch, your mind. The budget is so big, no wonder there is nothing to lose watching it as, at the least, you get a blockbuster action flick that delivers, but at most you get a look into futuristic time travel with excellent acting, directing, production values, and score."
341,"I really tried to watch this mess. Sound horribly mixed with dialogue, fade characters, convoluted story dragged until you feel asleep. Really, some of these titans should reconsider and not taking movie fans as idiots."
342,"This is the kind of film where people, when you tell them that you neither liked nor understood the film, respond: ""Oh, you didn't get it, you need to watch it again. Fortunately, I'm very smart (and have a master in physics, just like Robert Pattinson) and therefore understood everything right away.""The whole film is a mess. The exposition is way too long and the rest ist just too confusing. I found myself very soon in my seat not caring about anything: the protagonist, the inverted bullets, nothing. I'm a fan of Christopher Nolan, but not to the point that I'd become an apologist for every flick he makes.Hope Nolan does better next time. This thing is a waste of time and money."
343,An incredible action packed sci fi film that'll bend your mind and leave you thinking about it for hours after it's over.
344,Very convoluted and rushed. 2.5 hours I will never get back. Resist watching this movie and thank me later.
345,"I sometimes think Christopher Nolan is too smart for his own good. His movies are truly mind-blowing in terms of the complexity that is put into the story. My only fear is that the average human can't maintain that level of processing for 150 minutes. I know I couldn't during 'Tenet'. I tried so hard to keep up with the story and exactly what was happening and why, but it was ultimately too difficult on a first viewing. By the end of the film I was basically just enjoying the ride for what it was. I think I would need to see this film 3-4 times through to begin to fully understand the storyline and all its interweaving plot lines.Like in every modern Nolan film the action-sequences are nothing short of amazing. As you will have seen in the trailers, there is plane needing to be crashed into a terminal. Now most filmmakers would be happy to use CGI or miniature scale models, but not Nolan. No, Nolan decides to actually crash a plane into a building for real. Just comprehend that for a moment. I remember when actually flipping a truck in 'The Dark Knight' was the most shocking thing he had ever done.Non-linear time has been used in film a lot, but not in this way. This film feels about as original as movies ever come these days. Most of us hear an interesting scientific theory and think, that's fascinating, and go on with our day. Nolan hears one and think, I'm going to make a movie about that. He clearly learns these theories inside out too. You can tell from the complexity of the film that he knows his stuff impeccably well.The movie has a little bit of a James Bond feel to it. I thought that multiple times during the film, and then read afterwards that he was intending for something along those lines. If a sci-fi Bond film sounds like your kind of thing, then this movie is going to be a delight for you.The film does feel a little soulless overall unfortunately. A lot of characters feel like they are just there to spew information out to the audience, rather than actually having any character or memorable aspects about them. It is also a lot less funny than Nolan films usually are. His films are usually filled with hilarious little one-liners, but they were oddly vacant here. Finally, the dialogue can be a little hard to pick up throughout the film. The score and sound-effects are often so loud is drowns out what exactly is being said, which in a film this fast-paced and complicated can be an issue.I had a great time with 'Tenet' but it wasn't quite the masterpiece I had hoped for. It's an amazing production, but it certainly isn't without its flaws."
346,"When it comes to concept of time, Nolan name was a trademark, until Tenet. Memento and Inception, also Interstellar were great movies that offered thought provoking ideas about dimensions and relativities of time. But Tenet, with some witty dialogues and ""dramatic"" special effects, ended up making the audience feel stupid while tries to explain what is going on between future and the past. Far away from being a proper movie, i believe overrated reviews was a result of respect to the name of the director, not the movie itself."
347,"Nolan do his bests, It really have 10/10
This film takes time to find its place among the people. This is one of Nolan's best. We are waiting for its HD quality."
348,"Get the audio fixed!Came out of a fricking global pandemic shutdown to see a movie, and could only make out a third of the dialogue.Great story, great cinematography, sweet special effects, really good ideas, and yeah, you can piece them together, but was that part of the design? For the sound to suck?Get it fixed."
349,Even if you understand this movie it's still a disappointment. Acting wasn't good and the music was so overly loud. It left me with a massive headache and having to brass myself whenever action was about to occur. I was covering my ears the entire time. Clearly no good movies have come out this year and people are grasping onto anything semi watchable and saying it's great as a topic of conversation or for a social media post. If you're going to watch this movie then do so by streaming it Illegally at home where you can save your money because literally anything other than this is money well spent.
350,So who watches this or am i watching another film ? This was so bad and i mean bad why the hype i guess they are clutching at straws once again Nolan is an ok director maybe good but he is not a god and this proves it with this movie.
351,"If this movie was made from a diferent director, no one talk about it. Its a big piece of trash."
352,"Good film, worth seeing, but unlike other time bending films such as Inception, nothing in Tenet really caught my imagination enough to want to sit through again so that I could fully follow all the intricacies of the time travel plot.
It's a bit confusing (certainly the first half, the second half clears a few things up), there are a couple of big stunts, but the lead actors are not very engaging. I didn't really care about any of them and they didn't really seem to care about each other. All a bit stilted in the end. I also didn't really care about the end of the world, which is probably a bigger issue.
The grandfather paradox (if I travel back in time and kill my grandfather how can I exist to go back in time etc.) is mentioned, but sort of waved away with a 'it is what it is / who knows what will happen? shrug of the shoulders. But as everything that happens in the past in the film is clearly seen in the present, when the end of the world turns out to have been planned to occur a few weeks ago, it sort of means it probably didn't happen, then and we should all stop worrying.
The other issue was the sound quality. A reasonable amount of the film is done with the leads wearing masks. This makes for muffled speech to the extent that I couldn't understand some bits. And it doesn't help when strong Russian accents are attempted and spoken with a time reversed echo. I pretty much lost that entire scene.
So, meh, it's no Dark Knight."
353,"Tried to be too clever, and as a result was just complete nonsense and confusing. I don't think Nolan would have even understood what he'd produced by the end of it. Would only recommend for massive film snobs who will pretend they enjoyed and understood it."
354,"No spoilers. We loved it, we will go again next weekend!
I am relieved to read in a previous review from someone else that he/she did not always get what the actors were saying. I thought that it was my ears that were not so good on the day.. not sure if it is the sound or if they were speaking very fast..
But we are going to see it again anyway, and on a big screen again!"
355,"Yeah this movie was decent. A somewhat confusing, good looking movie: would most likely have been a lot better if you could hear the actors? I'm furious about this and can't give the movie a better score because of it.I feel this is escalating with Nolan. I think I started to think about the problem with hearing the actors in Inception, and in Dark Knight Rises and Interstellar it was the same, maybe even worse. Definitely worse in this one. This movie does best in a home theatre, with headphones."
356,"It just feels like a remake of older movies like Inception, with small added twists. The concept is fantastic, but it was so poorly done I was falling asleep throughout the movie, wondering why on earth we paid to see this.Don't give them your money. Honestly. It's really bad."
357,"For me, Nolan was the BEST director of this generation. I saw Interstellar at least 15 times and I loved it each time. There was a lot of science there, but almost everybody could understand the plot and you dont needed to rewatch the movie to get it. Then it came Dunkirk and I hated it so much. Boring and without heart. It make my doubt about my feelings about Nolan, and my feelings were wrong, as Tenet proves that this guy has lost the floor and he wants to create elaborate plots not with the intention to tell a history, but with the intention to brag to the audience ""see, im so smart and you are an idiot and so dumb to understand my script""Since the very first minute in Tenet a lot of things are happening, but you dont understand a thing. One or two things get something close to an answer, but there are a lot more questions. The result, YOU STOP ENJOYING THE MOVIE BECAUSE YOU DONT UNDERSTAND A THING THATS GOING ON and also you stop caring about the characters in the story. The best example its the last battle. I dont got a thing of what was happening until the end. I got bored for the same reason, if I can understand whats happening, why should care about whats on screen?I had to go to youtube and see a couple of videos to understand what the movie was about. If a movie can be self explainatory at the first watch, it fails, even worse if you have to go to another media to understand what the movie should explain by itself.Yes, the movie its very well done, music, photography, direction, acting, its a clever plot, but it fails to explain itself to the audience. You cant ask to the audience to watch your movie several times in order to start to understand your plot. Thats cheating. I just lost the faith in Nolan. What a shame, Interstellar its my favorite movie."
358,"The only character I would have loved to see moving backwards, would have been me away from the cinema before the movie starts..."
359,"A mind bending rubik's cube that only a few of us can solve. The only drawback was the sound mixing, the dialogues were hard to follow in some scenes. Apart from that, it is a masterpiece.Washington, Pattinson and Debicky's performance was really good. Amazing stunt sequence, background music, etc, etc. And above all it's a Nolan movie.If Inception is dream within a dream this is time travel within time travel."
360,"Really enjoy Nolan's films and understood he likes non-linear storytelling. I gave 9/10 and not 10/10 because maybe a tad bit too far this time. However, lots of oh yeah moments, tremendous action, great acting and in the end, the writer ties it all together albeit with a few head scratches. Still great experience and loved being back in a theater."
361,Common Nolan who speaks english like that..... why are you making movie with such bad English which a normal person can never understand.
362,"A total lifeless convoluted movie. The premise, the plot, the cringey dialogue all too laughable. If there was an attempt to beat Inception, this truly failed. Even the actions scenes felt contrived. Wish I could go back and take my time-wasted on this garbage."
363,"Hard to grasp at first. Uninteresting and vaguely developed characters. Mediocre acting. Screenplay too complicated and too many low effort ""crucial"" sentences make this the worst Nolan movie to date.
Music was ok but too repetitive and simplistic.
I'll give a 3 stars only because of the scenery and good camera work."
364,"Yesterday afternoon, I went to the local Cinema to watch Tenet. While the majority of the plot was kept very secretive, I knew that it was a science fiction thriller about time travel and had something to do with preventing WW3 from the trailers. The presence of my favourite Indian Actress Dimple Kapadia (who in her younger years was quite a dish) was also somewhat of a pleasant surprise and having seen Christopher Nolan's previous work and having mixed reactions (for the record I despised Interstellar) I decided to give the film a chance.At a staggering runtime of 150 minutes, I found the film to be overlong, boring and rather tedious. While the trio of Washington, Pattison (who I look forward to seeing in The Batman) and Debicki all showed great potential for future films, I was left very dissapointed with the the plot and unnecessarily complex structure, which no doubt would have left many viewers confused. I did not appreciate the fact that the film took a highly anti-Russian stance throughout and played on oligarchic stereotypes. The references to the Tolstoy/Pugachev affair were totally unnecessary, hypocritical and used merely to paint a very negative picture of Russian's. Combined with the sudden shifts in jumping forward and backwards in time, the film became unwatchable.When we actually learn what the movie is about (not WW3 but rather environmental hysteria), then we also realise why the studios were not so keen to reveal this to the audience as sane, reasonable people who use logic would have refused to see it. I myself walked out of the cinema in sheer disgust with 30 minutes of the film remaining, something that I have never done before. This film could easily have been a top class heist movie, but they ruined the opportunity by taking it into the very left wing direction that they subsequently went with.Christopher Nolan has lost alot of credibility as a director in my eyes. And I myself have always found him to be overrated. When Christopher Nolan made the second and third Batman films, he was asked about the speculation regarding the villains that would appear in those movies. He quite snobbishly suggested that villians such as the Penguin, Mr Freeze and the Riddler would not have any place in his universe as they were apparently difficult to interpret in a serious film. This is of course something that he was proved totally wrong on, when we saw all 3 characters portrayed brilliantly in Gotham the TV series. And had Heath Ledger not passed away, then the The Dark Knight and Dark Knight Rises would have followed pretty much the same plot as the Frank Miller comic book 'The Dark Knight Returns'. To me that shows that he's a sub par director who just likes to stick with what has been done in the past and repeat it. Heath ledger's joker character was basically portrayed previously in the form of Tyler Durden from Fight Club. There was nothing new or special about that character, even though I liked Ledger's performance.If you really want to see an intellectual and well thought out movie about time travel, don't waste your money on the overly long and boring Tenet. Instead, watch the Alex Garland TV series DEVS, which is without a shadow of a doubt a work of genius."
365,"Seriously, can you tell? What exactly is anyone doing anything? Who tf are they fighting in that last battle? Who are they shooting? Why are the bad guys doing what they're doing knowing what's gonna happen? Why are the dialogues so childish and amateurish?
WTF was the sailing scene? What the actual F was the point of that? Why is the editing so weird?
The ""protagonist"" doesn't know and in his 30 years of life never heard of the grandpa paradox so the other guy explains it to him to the audience can know what it is? Is that the best way you can come up with an exposition? Are you serious? ""The whole world will fkn end"", ""oh no, my son will die too"". ARE YOU KIDDING ME???!?!
Inception was good because the movie explained the rules of that world and we understood why things were happening and what the motivation of each character was, but this? Yeah, good luck finding anything that makes sense in this. Ask Nolan and even he doesn't know wtf he wrote and what the rules of this nonsensical world is.
The movie is just too fkn fast-paced for its own good. Movie is 2 and a half hours but it's like a theatrical version of a 3 or 3:30hour director cut.
With this rate Nolan's going, I'm thinking his next movie will be just 2 hours of earr*pe soundtrack and we can't even understand with subtitles. Going back to the root of cinema and have ""silent film"" with just music and subtitles. Go and look up ""Confessions of a Christopher Nolan Fanboy"" on youtube to see why Nolan movies are getting more like the way they are now.
I'm already so bored with this one that I don't think I'm gonna watch it a second time."
366,"Oxford definition of preposterous: contrary to reason or common sense; utterly absurd or ridiculous. This describes Tenet perfectly. Anyone who rates this film highly is just pandemic-starved for the big screen. Technical flaws, like inaudible dialogue most of the time and trite dialogue when you could hear it, ridiculous plot twists with multiple rabbit holes, unbelievable motivations for the main characters - nothing works in this movie besides the fact we are in the theater again."
367,"This film is really mind-blowing. The plot has a lot of twists and unpredictable moments, also it has a lot of science but it is easy to understand because you have good explanation of it. Secondly, the cast is good, Robert Pattinson breaks all stereotypes about him, and Kennet Brana is awesome as main villain. Thirdly, I like all action and special effects, it's amazing.
So, it's great Nolan's film."
368,"They say in while in making movies, music and writing, that you have to know the rules to break them. Nolan takes this a step further with the laws of physics in this movie. And he breaks them in a respectful way in awesome manners.
i understand that this movie is hard to follow at times. As kind of a nerd i understood before watching this movie what entropy is and how it affects time. and that felt like a big help. still i feel like it there are so many pieces to put together, and i cant wait to see it again to put them together.
The Cinematics are magical and so innovative i gasped. Fight scenes and car chases where the subjects go different ways in time. Battle scenes where one squad fights the fight forwards and one squad fights backwards in time.
Chris Nolan! this is Amazing, especially for me, a film-student who loves physics!"
369,"Tenet is a film that will stay with you forever from its first scene, one that will tempt you to revisit it in part or as a whole, and that really tells you what it is: a masterpiece."
370,"Go see this, Nolans new masterpiece is a real brainpuzzle. I was told to pay very good attention to ever detail and so I did. I think I got it. But if you don't pay attention, you won't. Then go watch it again. :)"
371,"Another Christopher nolan's masterpiece, such a great movie by that genius. 10/10"
372,"So how best to describe this movie? Imagine Christopher Nolan directing James Bond but.....with time travel incorporated into the mix. Have seen plenty of reviews online claiming that this is a very complex film. One that is very hard to comprehend in its entirety in a single viewing. That couldn't be further from the truth and I don't know what has happened to our critics. This is one of Nolan's more simpler films. There is a ton of exposition dedicated to explaining the specifics of time inversion, the predestination theory of time travel etc. I won't go into the details as that would venture into spoiler territory but the movie basically spoon feeds the audience and to be honest, at times it was too on the nose for me. Critics will find movies like Endgame perfect which had multiple contradictions during the course of its own narrative. No wonder that Scorsese thinks we're killing cinema.Onto the action in this film. There was this misconception in the online film sphere that Nolan is 'bad' with action scenes. Folks who believed that will have to eat up their words as this film has some of the best action scenes that i've seen in some time. The visuals and the stunts are breathtaking and to think that Nolan achieved with no CG. I know Nolan doesn't like to give away BTS footage but I hope he makes an exception for this film. I'm dying to see how they achieved this in camera with no green screens. As with most Nolan movies, the score is once again a strong aspect which enhances the viewing experience. For the longest time, I thought Hans Zimmer was the composer and you'd be forgiven if you're still under that impression but apparently, Zimmer was busy with another film and Ludwig Goransson replaced him and he has done an excellent job.To close it off, I'd like to discuss some of the negatives. This movie has paper thin characters like they're almost non existent. I know bloggers are using this to fuel this narrative that this is Nolan's achilles' heel and that he's 'bad' with character work. These people are really bad with memory. This is the same director who reinvented Batman for a generation by making you care about Bruce and Batman simultaneously. Something that was unprecedented at the time. His character work has always been one of his core strengths. I cared about Dom Cobb in Inception and I cared about the Cooper family in Interstellar. These are beautifully fleshed out characters. Dunkirk was always going to be a plot heavy film but I really wanted more with the characters in this particular film. Nothing wrong with the performances though. All of them were awesome. Loved the chemistry between John David Washington and Robert Pattinson.The weak character work is the only thing holding me back from giving this film a perfect score. With stronger character work, this would've been an all time classic."
373,"If you have had the luxury of going to the theaters or you are planning on watching Tenet this review will give you an idea of what to expect. I will not try to give any spoilers that are not in the trailer. To begin, the plot of Tenet is fairly complex. The Protagonist is apart of the CIA, he ""dies"" on a mission and is sent on a mission to save the world. The future and the past coincide and it's his job to find out what is happening and put an end to it. IF you thought Inception was difficult to follow you are in for a doozy. In fact, I would go so far as to say that unless you are able to easily follow what happened in Inception, please don't watch this as your head may explode. They are by no means comparable in terms of plot; however, as someone who just watched Tenet for a second time, there are still several information gaps I don't fully understand. That being said if you have great focus and love to investigate, you love brain games and confusion, I would thoroughly recommend this as it will take you into a wild ride. IF however, you are the average viewer looking to spend a day/an evening ""unplugging"" or enjoying sane writing do yourself a favor and avoid this one. I intend to watch this movie likely two more times, but not until it comes out on DVD/Online. Subtitles are very important here as, with all of Christopher Nolan's films, the writing is essential to understanding what is happening in the film and there are two relatively important characters that I was only able to understand 50% of what was said, because of their thick accent and involved wording. Again, this was my second viewing. All told, I would give this film an 8/10. In spite of being extremely difficult to follow and probably intentional holes that I would like to have seen filled, it is still an incredible idea executed well, but not something for everyone to enjoy."
374,"Prepare for a cinematic experience, pay attention to every detail and submerge yourself in this epic masterpiece. Probably the best Robert Pattinson performance and at last you get to see Kenneth Branagh fit the role perfectly. I've had to watch it twice, I enjoyed it first time around but simply blown away the second. Music is outstanding. You go go from 0 - 60 mph within seconds and it does not stop until the end credits. Cinema is back and thank god for Christopher Nolan"
375,"What a masterpiece. I have never been this excited after watching a movie, even after watching Endgame does not make me feel this kind of excitement. Sorry Marvel. I am speechless after the movie. It feels so satisfying.
If you can, find the biggest cinema screen that have the loudest speaker (Ludwig Goransson you are the best) in your area to watch this movie. You can thank me later. Seriously, go and watch it."
376,"A wonderful concept, clumsily realises. I knew what to expect sadly, and wasn't excited to see it, but gave it the benefit of the doubt. I understand the concept, this wasn't lost on me, but found the method of telling the story to be a brash!? I think the concept would have been better realised with a more Blade Runner/Altered Carbon/Sci-Fi time frame or a more a drastically more artistic and flamboyant visual. It's a shaky, gritty War zone film that doesn't let you process what's happening. I felt empty at the end. Hope you like it."
377,"The tremendous amount of noise from the terrible score left the cinema shaken. But unfortunately, the movie failed to stir. Except to say that Nolan did a splendid job of recreating the elements of a Bond movie that have gone missing in recent years. The secret agent hero was cool, sophisticated, dignified, funny ... the opposite of the UFC gorilla portrayed by Daniel Craig. The villain was superb. The girl caught in the crossfire was spot on Bond. Even the general storyline and concepts would have done well in a Bond movie. But geez, forget about trying to decipher what is going on from scene to scene. Snippets of barely legible dialogue over a noisy score are all on offer. Perhaps Nolan thought it was better this way than to expose the audience to the terrible disappointment that sits behind the facade."
378,Way too hard to understand. Not enjoyable. Dialogue purposely written to confuse all but those willing to return and mind map the plot but why bother putting in so much effort. It's meant to be entertainment not a science class. The sound mix is purposely off balance with voice mixed low and music mixed loud. Not a fan.
379,"Awful like all of Nolan's non Dark Knight movies (which in contrast I think are spectacular and probably the only reason why I keep giving Nolan a chance).
Muffled dialogue. Intentionally obscure I reckon and too much of the whole tell but don't show stuff most of the time.Zombie female characters acting with that sort of annoying attitude as if they have seen everything that has possibly happened all before so they don't care and constantly have an advantage over the male characters but at the same time being physically useless mostly. Old fashioned in that sense. Female main character is only concerned about one thing whilst the world is ending and her motive is the constant tell but don't show approach which doesn't work in movies to make you feel even remotely invested.No sensible motive for the main ""villain"", who sort of appears out of nowhere 1 hour into the movie. By then it's almost too late to even care what you are watching. Far too loud music at times, like Dark Knight without the essence of threat or stakes being raised. Nonsense ""plot"". Nonsense MacGuffins which make totally no sense. People screamed from roof tops when there were a few MacGuffins in Star Wars. Here we have inverting machines located at weird locations, an algorithm that looks like a nuclear bomb spread all over. These things are used to explain some major reasons for things happening (Well you go into this machine / revolving chamber so... just forget everything we told you earlier too btw, hmmm why?)Why was the revolving chamber at the airport, near the fake painting storage facility? Why if the female character could heal from a gunshot wound by being inverted could the main character not get rid of his cancer and just invert himself to a healthy 20 year old? What is the limitation of the inversion? It is not well explained. How was the villain going to achieve WWIII exactly? It is all so vague to be honest. A sci fi movie works best if you set the stage and set some boundaries of the reality you create. Whenever you break those boundaries too much or don't set them clearly you've lost me, as a story writer can then just get away with doing anything (See the likes of Endgame introducing a second time travelling device which I think is an example of very disappointing or lazy story telling too).On the plus side this movie has some good looking effects and good Imax cinematography. Maybe Nolan should have been a cinematographer for a better story teller director or something. His Dunkirk I thought was bizarre and emotionless, his Interstellar is the most boring non fun and pretentious Sci Fi movie I've seen in the cinema. Movies can be serious but even Schindler's List had a few jokes in it to keep you captivated and entertained and more importantly see that there is light even in the darkest of times in human history.Don't bother unless you are a Nolan superfan. You will no doubt think this is another ""masterpiece"" as almost every second review states here.To me it's mindless nonsense wrapped in a shroud of ambiguity to pretend it's clever somehow.Tenet might be the only 2020 movie I will see in the cinema as the mask wearing is just not a pleasant experience for near 3 solid hours with trailers. I wanted Nolan to make it worthwhile but I just don't think he pulled it off.
The movie will find an audience I guess but I don't think personally I'll bother with another Nolan movie again."
380,"I have never genuinely watched a movie that has given me a headache.
A cluster of confusing scenes, pieced together with way too much dialogue that struggled clear up anything that was unfolding, if in fact it was actually audible.
One of the worst films I have ever watched. Anyone who enjoys this needs to pull the head out."
381,"The most interesting fact about this movie is that two people can see and rate it the complete opposite. There are many raving 10/10 reviews while I'd give _Tenet_ less than 1 star if I could. Why you ask?First it was made by Nolan, second it was hyped, third it cost 200 million dollars. I didn't even mention anything I saw on the movie screen yet. High expectations paired with a huge budget and one of the biggest directors of these days made me at least hope for a solid movie.The reasons why this movie is so horribly bad are many. If I would make a list of every catagory a movie could gain points, I wouldn't know how to award _Tenet_ any. Did I like the actors? Not really. Did I care for the characters? No. Was it a thrilling ride? No. Did I like the film settings? No, it was rather depressing, dark, lifeless, claustrophobic. Did I understand the dialogues? Parts of them but the language barrier wasn't the only reason not getting all the necessary information.What about the score music? Not impressive at all. The action? I lost my interest for the movie after 30 minutes or so. Then _Tenet_ just gave me the same frustrated feeling as watching _Transformers 2_ in cinema - I just was staring at the screen, watching absoutely soulless and confusing non-stop action while just feeling dazed and hoping that the 2 1/2 hours would be over soon. And not to mention the confusing plot itself. _Inception_ was a nice cinema experience and I received it as a solid actioner with cool elements/effects (which doesn't replace a good script but Hollywood is ignoring this aspect constantly), interesting actors/characters. _Tenet_ is so far from all that. The main target could've made an exciting movie. But the movie's world was rather small or limited. I come to think of _Twelve Monkeys_. Which is better in every way. Because the story feels human, realistic, it makes you think, it's emotional."
382,"Anyone who thinks this is a ""masterpiece"" is young. If I could give it zero I would"
383,"Almost from the beginning you realise that something went badly wrong in the production of this movie. The script was bad. The sound was terrible. The dialogue illegible. The editing was diabolical. As the movie develops you realise that you don't care about any of the characters. By halfway, you wish you were watching another movie. By the end, you are sad that nobody had the guts to tell Mr Nolan that he was filming a 'turkey'. What a Shame. All that effort for such a poor result."
384,"Good lord this is bad. The lead actor can't act, the dialogue is awful, the script is pants, and overall, it's pretty boring. There's so much exposition in this. The old adage is show not tell, but here, it's tell not show. It's big production, eery drone music to try and make you feel something, (when there's nothing to feel), and no real story. I'm sooo bored that 1:05 into the dvd, I decided to write this review. 3/10"
385,"The main character's name is protagonist, I believe that says it all. Super lazy writing! The movie started interestingly enough but went right into boring nonsensical explanations diving right in to the ridiculous. I lost interest roughly 30 minutes in, I continued to play it in the background thinking I might be drawn in, but I was wrong. If you value your time then stay away from this boring nonsense."
386,"I saw a review with the title ""brilliant film"", to counteract I use the title worthless film. I have to admit I watched only the first 45 minutes of it. I gave up, no clue what I was watching. I hate that, I don't like puzzles. A movie should not be a puzzle, maybe for a short time in the beginning but then at some point it has to draw you in and that makes you keep watching. It didn't happen with this one. Tenet is an overrated much too complex and uninteresting, pretending to be Sci-Fi movie. You know what it really is? A waste of time."
387,"I was looking forward to this film given it was one of the most anticipated movie releases during COVID, and I love virtually all of Nolan's films... But I don't understand how people can give a positive review of this film. Great potential, poorly executed. Not even in the same league as Interstellar, Prestige, Dunkirk or Inception. Nolan must have too many yes men around him telling him everything he does is great. Don't waste your time."
388,"Tenet is not art, is not cinema and is not science too. if a Ukrainian bad man could go to past and futur. why he didnt go past and fix his life with his wife ???? where is the man who survived in the opening of movie? british and us persons are best. russian and indian persons are bad. dont you tired about this scenario ????? Tenet doesn,t have any story. what is cinema ? what is the goal of dialogue?"
389,"I won't go into the details as many reviews here have touched on the plot.I feel Nolan has made this overly complex simply for the sake of it.
There are plenty of pot holes that are not explained, the acting is average, Ken's Eastern European accent is horrible and I simply did not care for any of the characters.This is a fail in my book from one of the best writer/directors out there ..."
390,Where do I even start? from weird music playing throughout the whole movie and dialogs to things that absolutely make no sense. Im pushing it even with 4 stars...
391,"I don't know if i'm dumb, but this film felt pretentious to me. The writing is horrible. It try so hard to be ""smart"" but, ended up being cocky. They know that the plot is too hard for the audience to understand, but they don't even bother simplified it.to quote from the random scientist, ""don't even try to understand it"" and ""your head hurts yet?""yes. that's a real quote.Aside from the pompous plot , the acting/directing is not any better. The conversation between the characters feels really forced. I know some of the line are hard to deliver, but it seems like the actor didn't even try. Not to mention there are numerous corny lines. OH MY GOD. The fact that it was written by Christopher Nolan, The Master himself is mind boggling.Tenet is basically a failed spy/action film with splash of sci-fi. The fighting scene is like done by an amateur and looks extremely awkward. At some point, during the fight scene, it looks like a guy having a seizure on the ground.The only good thing i can say about Tenet is probably the visual. It's as good as any nolan's film.You should definitely questioned some review that said Tenet is ""masterpiece"" ( cause they probably a hypocrite lol)"
392,Tries to be smart but fails. Watching it again wouldn't help other than to help realize how bad it is. Reminds me of that movie where people shoot bullets around corners. Would have been better as a comedy. Im sure b-movie fans will love it. First review ever.
393,What's that loud background music throughout the movie and the mumble ? Also the movie is so confusing?
394,"This movie is confusing just to be confusing. The pace is so fast, nothing makes any sense, and I just feel dumb by watching it. I couldn't get through 5 minutes without being completely and utterly confused! Can we just realize that Christopher Nolan drank too much of his own Kool-aid on this one and it really isn't that good????"
395,"When it comes to the technical side, so the cinematography, sound, editing and lighting, you'd expect Nolan to always get a 10/10 for that. Tenet followed Nolan's checklist and produced some incredible action sequences. Inspiring performances from John David Washington and Robert Pattison - they both enhanced some of the more dramatic scenes. However, I've said multiple times that one thing Nolan lacks is a dramatic enough script but I finally think that in Tenet, the fast paced dialogue was perfectly fit for the score and the visuals. Although it was a terrific film by Nolan I still wouldn't but it above Inception."
396,"The only thing I can figure is that people have Nolan idol syndrome..
This movie was a pompous, arrogant, loud, mess.
It wasn't ""smart"" it was ridiculous.
The first movie I have walked out of in years. And I gave it at least an hour, maybe a touch longer.
I am completely at a loss on the reviews. They are either flat out liars are just blind."
397,"I don't think I've ever been more disappointed by a movie. I was expecting a mix between James Bond and Inception and I all got was a massive headache.
First thing first, the audio mix is COMPLETE garbage, it made me questioned whether I had lost the ability to understand the english language with all this mumbling. Second, the scenes and dialogues are overly played and long. Third having all these reverse effects is visually unattractive and feel very unnatural (like watching a reverse tiktok video of people jumping in a pool and replay that video over a five minutes period). To top it off, probably the fault of the cinema, I realised 10 sec into the movie that the sound was way too loud and had to leave 15 mins before the end of the movie given the constant explosions.
Some individuals seem to indicate that they completely figured the movie out the second time around. Personally, I think that, had the movie been done properly, everyone would have gotten it after seeing it once.. Think the matrix or inception for example"
398,"I was unable to follow this film after the first 12 seconds . However the steak Michael Caine was eating looked nice . I loved the mercedes s class as well , oh and the nachos from cinema were alright to eat . Overall it was a nice sit down in the cinema and I got bored and walked out 1:30 hrs in . Feel sorry for whoever has to watch this film though ."
399,"Where does one begin? Can mere words do justice to this big budget blockbuster of futile proportions? Terrible background music/noise drowned out much of the dialogue. This was no small mercy as the dialogue you could actually hear was on a par with the clunking utterances of cerebrally-challenged stick insects. The acting, in fairness, was ground breaking and redefined the entire 'tediously vapid and emotionally vacuous' genre without working up a sweat. A remarkable achievement. As was the superbly delineated unpredictable sociopath with a Russian accent. The plot? Who knows? Who cares? I certainly did not and spent much of the 150 minutes reminding myself to tell my lungs to breathe occasionally as my subconscious had obviously decided that humanity had no future and it was pointless carrying on. I would have left early but I am one of nature's optimists and expected the cavalry, in the form of a script editor, to pop up at any minute to inform the audience that the film was an elaborate hoax designed to test just how far one could take the 'emperor has no clothes' motif before the public cottoned on. The conclusion is 'very far indeed'."
400,If you take away all the visual effects and gimmicks you are left with a very wear story-line. We barely no anything about the main character or any characters and I found myself really no caring if they lived or die. Great stories have strong themes and characters we can relate to. If this film was put out without any stars and an unknown director you'd all be giving it 1
401,"Dark spinoff or what? Really was hoping for something more, but not this mediocre wannabe mix of dark, inception and cloud atlas without any sense. Idea of Schroedingers cst could be implemented much much better."
402,I Hope you will read this before you see the other Reviews on this. The Most critics here are from people for them it was to hard to follow or they can t follow the movie or they don t understand the whole movie and than they comes here to started hating. I will say to you go watch this movie it is absolutely brilliant and a classic Chris Nolan movie. Please build your own opinion and don t trust the bad critics here.
403,"Before I pick on the plot and storytelling issues, let us discuss the general presentation. The movie is shot alright, but feels rather lackluster compared to the Batman trilogy, or Inception or Interstellar. The action is average, but there is a serious disconnect here since most of the time you have no idea who is who and what their goals are. So the action becomes boring and noisey.Anyway, the music seems more generic this time around as well. Not sure what is more disappointing, since usually Nolan is careful with his music team and at least you end up with something unique and great. Here you get generic electronic stuff mixed with dubstep and/or rap music.Now the storytelling is confusing. Stunted dialogue, forced technobabble and characters saying things like 'don't try to understand it'... Yeah I got it, Nolan doesn't understand it either, so he didn't bother writing a script that made any sense.Before you go to pay to watch this crap, just understand if you like nonsensical time travel related plots with no time spent understanding the characters or driving any development. If you think that is for you, then great.One of the main issues this movie doesn't work is that Nolan doesn't want to explain a single thing about the plot. Just vague hints dropped here and there. The story fails to pull me in because the nemesis of the story is never met or the doomsday never occurs. It is just an idea, with no payoff anywhere. Just a vague and limp twist at the end.3/10 it is not the worst big budget film of 2020, but it is close and very disappointing."
404,"Do you even imagine how hard is it to create something absolutely new in 2020? But Nolan nailed it, having produced pure innovative beauty!"
405,I just got home after losing 3 hours of my life to this movie. My head and stomach hurt from the deafening level of the action and music. The sound is so loud you can't even hear all of the dialogue. Of course I doubt that would have helped. The scientific plot holes and overall poor execution of a great premise left me annoyed and confused. Please save yourself the misery and pass on this one.
406,Once again we have to see a film that has to be so loud it takes away anything that is good. The problem is it's not good but overblown and pretentious crap that was a waste of my two hours.
407,"I agree on all the 8's and 9's given here, but that depends entirely on IF you get the movie or not. If you cannot grasp , even partially, what its about, then its dreadful or not so good. I (think) I got it (I also love Memento, Inception etc) and think it is a very clever, spectacular and thrilling movie. I saw it. luckily, on an IMAX screen , and the Bass audio (and more) was thrilling and intense, seats vibrated.
Ludwig Göransson's score is fitting the film, in that is is at times unsettling, but also accentuates the intricacies and feeling of the plot.And the lead actors are all Extremely good here. I felt scared for 'Kat' when Kenneth Branagh's 'Sator' was really menacing, not overacting i m o.
John David Washington as 'the Lead '(Protagonist) was fenomenal.
Also Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki, Hats off!And did i mention that is is a SPECTACULAR film? It is! And many stunning landscapes to view.9/10 from me.
Well Done Chr. NOLAN. Pity the Corona-crisis/Covid seems to be truncating the box-office revenue for this one. It deserves massive crowds seeing it in the cinema, which is now sadly not possible."
408,In the end when it all makes sense the entire movie gets better
409,"TENET is Mr. Nolan's Wild Ride!
The special effects and real-time location shots are some of the best of Nolan's career, James Bond-like and brilliantly photographed in a time sequence format by his cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytema, who worked as DP on 2 other Christopher Nolan films, ""Dunkirk"" and ""Interstellar."" These are reasons the film should be seen in the cinema, on the big screen, to be truly appreciated. Took 2 stars off (8 out-of 10) because, while I understood the concept of TENET, Saving the World and International Espionage, the plot is the most challenging to follow of all Nolan's movies. The film moves so quickly, so much going on, that plot points were missed in this first screening of the movie. In true Nolan fashion, as with some of his other films, TENET will require multiple viewings to discover what was missed and to fully comprehend the story. Fine performances from John David Washington as Protagonist, Robert Pattinson as his past-present-future partner Neil, Elizabeth Debicki and Kenneth Branagh who makes a great villain, and a cameo appearance from Nolan muse Michael Caine."
410,"I think I don't need to do talk about nolan's screenplay,but I need to,this movie crossed my expectations,I'm the one who understands memento just by watching it once but this movie makes me to watch twice to watch this in theatre,
Especially this movie wants you to work with your mind.
Comming to cast everyone did their best,and Ludwig Göransson filled the space of hans Zimmer precisely.
Finally thank you Nolan for giving us best experience."
411,"This movie is incredible. It introduces items who can move back through time, as if they are in a rewinded movie. This happens simultaneous to the real time world and it is sometimes pretty hard to keep track of what and who moves how and why but most importantly when. Acting is amazing, John David Washington is a very good actor and I hope to see more of him (maybe too soon to think about this but I could really see him play the next Black Panther). Nolan created a true masterpiece again. The one flaw with this movie is that it sometimes moves a little too quick, causing you to wonder what is happening a lot of the time. There were a couple of scenes which I thought looked really cool but had me wondering ""wait, why are we here again?"" All in all amazing acting and terrific action scenes. Highly recommended."
412,"Tenet is the new film by accomplished filmmaker Christopher Nolan, starring John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki, and Kenneth Branagh. I would usually give some kind of spoiler free plot synopsis before reviewing, but for Tenet that seems near impossible without A) going on for too long or B) spoiling something from the movie. The film is beyond intricately woven, as Christopher Nolan is going all out on his trademark extremely complex, plot heavy style. Conceptually, it was fascinating and the film-making itself was utterly breathtaking. The scale to this movie is truly amazing, with multiple sequences throughout the film being completely thrilling and spectacular. Nolan used every dollar from that gargantuan 205 million dollar budget with great care. With Tenet, Nolan once again proves he is one of the most daring, bold, and ambitious filmmakers working today. However, that doesn't make a film great... and Tenet is no exception. It's good, it kept my attention, but as a whole it felt a bit detached. This is an issue I've had with many Nolan films, but with Tenet I would say it's Nolan's biggest offender of lack of authentic emotion. This is all down to the thinly written characters and the unavoidably small amount you care for them. While the performances are all solid, the characters aren't given that many unique traits about them. The main character is simply called ""The Protagonist"" and it is ironically fitting for a character who's only purpose is to seemingly be the ""good guy."" He doesn't even get a proper introduction. I guess if I had to describe him, he is sort of a James Bond esque type, but that's not too original anyways. John David Washington does just about the best he can with the material, but unfortunately that just isn't that much. Robert Pattison's character ""Neil"" is also not given much complexity, but his character is a bit more memorable in my opinion, but maybe that's just down to Pattinson's natural charm. The only character you really feel emotionally attached to is ""Kat"" played by Elizabeth Debicki. However, I think this is probably more down to the sympathetic events surrounding her. I will say that the villain played by Kenneth Branagh is likely the most memorable character just due to the pure ferocity Branagh brings to the screen here. His ambitions do border on, for lack of a better word, cartoonish though. Now to be clear, I don't hate these characters... I just feel no attachment to them. This lack of strong character development makes the movie somewhat emotionless. The film also doesn't always execute exposition very successfully as Tenet is a lot of the time, unnecessarily hard to follow and convoluted. The film would be a lot more investing if Nolan would allow the audience to be let into the basics of the plot. Sometimes this works to great effect however, as Tenet's many audacious reveals are simply brilliant. All in all though, I enjoyed Tenet. I was constantly stunned by the incredible film-making and scale. Even if the character's weren't great, the complete complexity and ambition of the plot begs for a second watch. Tenet is a new experience and a stunning and boldly unique ride, even for its glaring flaws. I will probably watch it again one day, and it might be one of those movies that gets better each time you watch it (like a lot of Nolan's movies). Will those fundamental flaws disappear on a second watch however? Probably not. Tenet is a hard movie to review, because there is truly a lot of amazing things within this movie and it is a unique, audacious experience.... but there is also a lot of things to roll your eyes at as well.
8.0/10"
413,"It looks like Nolan watched few James Bond movies and tv series Dark and mix all that together. Great movie for cinema. Locations, sound are perfect. Direction and acting very good i realy liked Washington perfomance. Sometimes i felt i need pause button on cinema cause everything happens so fast. Some say its too complicated but its clasic Nolan. If you liked Memento and Inception you Will like this one too.
IDEA FOR NEW MOVIE : Mix Inception, Tenet and Memento. Agents go in Dreams, Travel the time and film is going backwards 🤣🤣🤣
We Will see Will this movie make enough money or Cristopjer will wish to travel the time and stop himself make this movie. Peace 😇"
414,Very much in the same vain as inception. I think just as good though I'd rather see it again before making that assertion.
415,Solid Action Film. Overly complicated plot. Good action sequence. Obvious plot holes. Characters just show up magically inside Soviet Union. Chased by single inept patrol car?? Ground army with no air support. Expect a fun ride not logic. Sorry Black Messia will beat Mr. Nolan's film for all the awards. It deserves recognition.
416,"You go through a curve of understanding with this film. This review contains mild spoilers, however I wouldn't really regard them as spoilers because they are all in the trailer and the ""twist/reveal"" is so incredibly obvious nearly everyone will pick up on it before it even comes into fruition on first viewing.The first time you watch it its extremely unlikely you will understand the majority of the film. You will enjoy it, the action sequences will blow you away, you will unfortunately be slightly deaf for a day or two afterwards, and you will be frustrated with the indeciperhable dialogue for a good 20% of the film. In general though, you will have a blast, 9/10.The second time you will watch it you will get a much better understanding of the ending, and you will be able to ""combine"" the plot together much better, you will start to question if the audio issues, especially in the Freeport exposition sequence and the second chamber sequence are done deliberately? You will still however not understand the car sequence, no chance. 8/10.The third time you watch it you will now pretty much fully understand it, and you will then start to realise bits of it unfortunately dont make sense by the films own rules, or even completely ignore the rules for the sake of plot. In addition you will realise that ultimately the relationship between the Protagonist and Kat doesnt make any sense whatsoever, why would he even care? which kinda rips a lot of sense out of the whole thing, and also that in reality you dont really care about literally any of the cast at all. Also you will come to the conclusion that Sators ultimate reason for his evil plan is really weak on the ground and doesn't really make any sense. 6/10The fourth time you watch it you realise that at least half of the film doesnt actually make sense at all, as in... definitely not. There are 3 absolutely massive issues all in the name of special effects: The guy going backwards through the wall doesnt work (the building would of needed to of been built around him, or the wall itself needs to be reversed, in both cases impossible), Neil cannot be alive in the cage at the end at all, even in reverse, and if he dies in reverse what happens to the body? The car cannot be reversed, at all. Its impossible. (it wont even fit in the time chamber). The bullet in the opera house is reversed, and causes damage in real time. The holes in the window in the Freeport chamber are already there in realtime, before the bullets are fired, and then when the gun is fired in reverse time it heals the bullets in real time. You cannot have both. Its either one or the other. 4/10The fifth time you watch it you will see completely past the special effects and sequences that make no sense to core issues with the film, not even the time manipulation aspect, the actual plot itself and the characters in it. At the end Kat could of quite easily just Tranquillised or knocked out Sator - problem solved, this renders the entirety of the rest of the film completely null and void, and this course of action makes far, far more sense than what they actually do. The complete lack of character building for every character with the exception of Sator/Kat, the whole ""TeneT"" gesture/word setup gets used... once. We never understand the organisation, or even why the entire ""test"" at the start is even necessary, if they were trying to keep it secret the whole concept is so ridiculous that if anyone did defect and try to tell an authority they would just think you were completely mad, and on top of that you could easily just reverse yourself and kill the defector before they defect. There is no need for the secret TeneT organisation at all, whatsoever. Why the hell was the indian arms dealer woman in the car outside the school at the end? Literally ridiculous. And so on, and so on... the more you think about it... 3/10I'm conclusion;
You never get this with Interstellar, you never get this with Inception. TeneT drops into the ""Memento"" category, where the film is ""enjoyably confusing"" to watch the first time round, however on subsequent viewing you come to realise that it cant even stand on its own two feet (the memento case being that its impossible for him to remember that he has no memory. Once you take this into account that film is also, completely ridiculous.)Nolan has MacGuffins in all of his films, gimmicks really, sometimes they work very well (inception sleep device in briefcase, interstellar forth dimension) however most of the time they just don't work at all and are actually plot destructively bad (batman begins water boiling device, memento remembering total memory loss, prestige cloning device). TeneT fits into the latter of the two categories.I give it 3/10 because ultimately, its a feat of cinematography just to even make the damn thing materialise on screen. However thats it. The characters are poor, the plot is frankly terrible, the concept is cool but totally flawed, the sound design is abysmal, the dialogue is crap (theres only two memorable piece of dialogue in the entire film), the music has one good theme, the other music in the film is unremarkable or jarring.The film says ""Dont try to understand it, feel it"" - On first viewing I thought it was a cool line, on my fifth and final viewing it comes across as a disclaimer."
417,"Effects - Top notch, mindblowing
Actors - Top, but not likeable... I didn't care if they win or die
Story - Well, I get it. Inception was ""fantasy"" or ""sci-fi"", Interstellar was great but here? This is garbage and almost nothing gets explained.How big could've been this movie 1) If we would care about all characters 2) if the story unfolds in the end and EVERYBODY would see the solution!!!How big ???Now it's such a huge let down..."
418,"This is just a disaster from start to end. the voice track is normal to low audio levels and the background noise is just maxed 200%. it's so hard to understand the dialog that i ended up watching it with subtitles !!!!!the editing is also sub par. full sequences are omitted, the actors are in one place then in another (not time travel sequences) the continuity is lacking.because of these reasons, i could not enjoy the movie even though i really wanted too. i used to be a Nolan fanboy giving him the benefit of the doubt for his audio choices but not anymore... he's just not 'getting' it. it's not artistic to have massive sfx and low audio dialog!! it's just annoying"
419,Complicated hobb job. Never ending jibber jabber. Boring.
420,"Dreadful film. The main actor was terrible, the science behind the movie blinding, the storyline awful- a rich Russian who is dying and wants to take the world with him (typical of these russians) and so on. In the end the russian is killed, the world is saved and that gorgeous actress gets that short, dim leading character."
421,"Complication IMO serves only as a smoke screen to hide hollow plotline, and plotholes, all while characters remain shallow and underdeveloped. One has a feeling they are some video game bots, doing their pre-programmed deadpan roles. Do that, action, take that, talk to this character, go there, bring that, oh bad guys captured you; escape, and do that instead. Only thing missing are healing potions/medpacks.
Little bit of spoilers: Things that claim to be ""intelligent and original"" are basically false. Not just physically innacurate, but false in claiming what they represent.
-If you see bullet hole in a wall, and se a person with a gun - it's easy, just get out of a trajectory, and voila - he'll miss you.
-car driving reverse in look clever, until you reverse the timeline to align with his: turns out car is driving in a wrong direction. Turns out nobody started the car driving, since protagonist finish the drive with pushing a break. In car's timeline he started a drive by pushing a break, and nobody is steering.
-Bad russian guy only talk backwards, but walk and act forward.
Everything is basically nonsense, when you aligned reversed timeline according to a objects and characters that are moving ""back in time""."
422,This is a terrible nonsensical movie. I feel robbed of my time. I suggest you do not believe the ratings. This is bad and long.
423,"Tenet is a new and crazy manifestation of his visual, auditory and ""temporal"" passions. Memento's backward-flowing narrative, Inception's characters wandering through layers, and Dunkirk's narrative of three different actions in the same war without being noticed in temporal terms, highly demonstrated that Nolan has a time fetish in every aspect. This time, the phenomenon of time spreads throughout the movie and the audience is felt, starting from the title. The Palindromic name, whose pronunciation is the same from both sides, is also reflected in the characters' relationship with time. The threat from the future but affecting the past, characters who can live the time in both directions, and the reversible flow make up the story in a compelling way, although a little confusing. At this point, we can contribute a line from the movie to the audience watching the movie; ""Don't try to understand it, feel it."" Because Nolan wants you to do this more.
In the movie, there is a main character who is often stated to be a hero. It is claimed that it will save humanity from a possible 3rd World War or, on the contrary, from the destruction of the world. The fact that Nolan has often stated that he wanted to shoot a Bond movie, being a stylishly dressed hero / agent and choreographically approaching the genre will immediately remind the audience of Bond movies through this hero. Bond atmosphere dominates the atmosphere in a significant part of the film. A Bond who is in the midst of temporal transformations, in gigantic scenes, and at the center of a science fiction story, must be exactly the character expected of Nolan. The fact that the character has to wear a mask while living an important ""time period"" in a scene has been added to the notes as an interesting coincidence for today. The fact that the opening scene of the film is watched in an opera house in a moment full of audiences and in a fatal manner will be remembered as a detail that adds coincidence. At this point, by the way, it should be said that the supporting characters and their formation contributed negatively to the film. The characters whose background is in the air, sometimes look cartoonish, who have a problem of credibility in their relationships, and their maneuvers in the story are a little damaging compared to the visual magnificence. After all, the movie will definitely become one of the most important movies for action cinema over the years. The movie, in which you will have difficulty understanding how 150 minutes passes, the perception of time is very well fed to the tempo, and we will see a lot of magnificent scenes, will tire even action lovers in a good way. The tempo is almost flawless, supported visually by a great job. Tenet has a dozen of successful action scenes that will be talked about a lot in a normal movie, even if there is only one, and they are all impressive. The stereotypical car chase scenes, the tension-filled moments at sea, the fight scenes, the well-planned airport scene, and many powerful scenes that don't come to mind at the moment of writing. Viewers who are addicted to action cinema will surely leave the hall to admire the movie."
424,"The general opinion is that to understand it, Tenet needs to be watched several times. But my strong impression is that Nolan should have read the script a few more time than he did. Not that I don't like the mind-blowingness, but as means to an end not as a scope in itself.
Nolan's obsession for tech details made the Inversion the main character shadowing the human characters, which are shallow, irrelevant and non-memorable some apparently important, like Target who does nothing remarkable.
Then to observe the recipe for classic cinematographic conflict Nolan sorts it out bluntly by naming the protagonist, well the Protagonist, but then never revealing the real Antagonist, the people from future? I know, Sator was the bad guy, but the reason for inversion tech was a failing future planet, and that story is missing.
Of course that I got from the first viewing and as I'm told by many at the second everything will make perfect sense...
The ""8"" is for the effort to put up an original idea which is an old-fashioned desire nowadays at Hollywood."
425,"Slow and stupid.When you find yourself surfing the web while watching a movie its a good sign that it's not worth watching.The aspect ratio swapping is just as distracting as it was in the recent Batman garbage.The reverse time fist fights look stupid and lackluster.This flick promptly became background noise about 45 minutes in, occasionally tuning back in when I heard something semi interesting happening."
426,"As many here noticed, it is incredibly frustrating to need a second watching to understand a movie. So I won't do it. Because when you do this kind of movies, you need to be sure that the first watching will already be a pleasure. It's not. Compare it with the sixth sense. When you don't know the end, you miss some details, and if you watch it twice it can be interesting but you don't have to do it. Here, the first watching is a pain and you HAVE to watch it twice to understand. Not because it's very intellectual. Not even because it uses some SF concepts. I've read a lot about time travel, I'm not scared of theses stories. No, it's the horrible dialogues and exposition scene that messes up the movie.
I have no idea why the dialogues are that fast but it's beyond ridiculous. Characters are almost cutting each other off, like they're gonna miss a train or something. And this for the whole duration of the movie, so I had to use subtitles, like I suddenly forgot the English language.
So I won't do my homework and watch it again because I wanted an experience, not a working task.The music is overly dramatic. It's good to have overwhelming atmosphere when the scene is important and intense, but there is heavy music all the time for 2 hours, so it loses all signification. It's rare to see epic music so badly used.Also, Robbert Pattinson is pretty good, but the MC has no emotion whatsoever. You might as well put a robot. It is a SF movie anyway.
Let's mention that the first scene is a mass shooting in a concert hall, like the 2015 attacks in France. It was very shocking to see that, and Nolan couldn't possibly ignore this fact. That is such a low-key way to make his movie stand out.The whole thing reminded me of the new brainless James Bond movies, when MC need to get some item to prevent the world from total extinction, which require a lot of pew-pew (that is the official term) and car racing (there is even a blonde). I hate this ""rich"" visuals with big cars, big boats, even planes, just to make things look expensive. Where is the story ?So, Nolan added some time reversing stuff to make things complicated and intellectual, but it doesn't really make sense. Maybe it does to him, to the writers even, but if it doesn't in the spectator's eye, then it doesn't matter. And the exposition scene doesn't explain anything, except that some object are time-reversed thanks to a future technology.
why does this work with people too, after half ot the movie ?do they stay reversed forever ?Does this property depends on the material ?what about the paradoxes ?What about the Tenet word ? They didn't use it a single time. Did they actually read their own story ?How reversed object are gonna possibly interact with normal objects ? The whole movie is based on this object having their own arrow of time but it cannot make sense. Some physicists argue that there is no arrow of time, like Minkowski's cube, but things still have to go ALL in a certain direction. Nolan's movie is just pure chaos.Because of the movie story, fight scenes are used twice and I couldn't believe it. I have to watch this again ?? Even if you watch the movie once, you get some stuff twice. What a scam.I hate the pseudo-scientific talk that is supposed to make everyone asleep and fall for it. So the objects are time-reversed because of some future radiation stuff. Yeah sure. I'm sorry but I love science, so I can't love this movie.The idea that some kind of formula is gonna suddenly make us able to violate laws of physics is so childish.We know gravity's law, are we able to control gravity ?The moral at the end is so pseudo-philosophical and forced that it shouldn't make it to the second draft. My two stars are for the visuals."
427,Absolute rubbish. Not much to say after wasting two and half hrs.
428,"One of the worst movies ever seen, really regret watching this movie, really really regret."
429,"How can I go backwards in time to where I started watching this movie and convince myself to watch an episode of ""Golden Girls"" instead?A lot of people say this movie makes sense if you watch it again. Why would anyone watch this movie twice?How does anyone tell these big-budget action apart? They all work under the premise that violence and gun-play are synonymous with quality, as in the more of them the better. They all have some huge and diabolical plot where the protagonist is ""fighting for the survival of the entire world.""We have to talk about the sound mixing in this mess. If I didn't have subtitles, I would have never understood about twenty-five percent of the dialogue. At what point does dramatic music (is it music?) become very undramatic and annoying? If you've ever wondered about that, all your answers can be found here.There is no real plot to this, it's just action scenes cobbled together, none of which really have much to do with the other.Why does he care so much about the wife of a Russian oligarch? ""Leave her alone,"" he cries at one point. It makes no sense at all the risks he takes to pull her irons out of the fire.$200 million budget. Imagine how many good movies they could have made for this sum."
430,"This movie has no meaning. Tries to be smart and different but leads to nothing. Acting is bad like they are reading from a script, no improvisation. Boring!"
431,"How on earth this film got the good reviews is utterly beyond my comprehension!
The ONLY good thing about it was the editing.
The sound was crap. The acting was mediocre and the direction was not up to the Nolan standard.
I waited ages to see this film and just wish I'd never bothered!"
432,"I do not write reviews but this time I couldn't stop myself. I was really excited about this movie. Watched trailer several times. Love Nolan's ""Dark Knight"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"". Was not satisfied with ""Dunkirk"" but war topic is never an easy one.
So i talked about ""Tenet"" nonstop waiting to watch it. i wish it's release would be postponed like all the releases in 2020.Long, boring, not interesting and not exciting. Actors murmured their lines, maybe first time i see and hear such a murmuring performance. Played very bad. The characters are so empty, I really didn't care if they die now or later or live till end. The plot was just not there.I wish Nolan could give my time back."
433,"You were once a very cool Director. What happened? I was looking forward to this movie for a long time, since the day it was announced. What did I get?An overly confusing plot that doesn't make any sense at all. The movie breaks some of its own rules that it set in the beginning. Multiple plot holes. Totally non-believable and unengaging lead actor.Boring, impotent and unentertaining trash. Just like your last movie Dunkirk, Mr. Nolan.Get better soon."
434,I wasn't sure what to think of tenet as my friend promoted it more than I had considered it but it ended up being a cool movie a bit confusing but I liked the performance
435,"Just like every other Nolan movie, each moment is a puzzling factor and it never disappoints!"
436,"This movie took my breath away. It was an intense, non-stop two and a half hours trying to piece together the story. But I think that's part of the fun. Great performances. There's nobody else making movies like Christopher Nolan. I still don't understand everything, but I can't wait to watch this again. Maybe next time with subtitles."
437,"Tenet is not a usual movie that shows really well what Nolan has going for it.The music the action sequence the complicated but a masterfully delicate plotline is definetly something that gives an amazing cinematic experience if you can let go of either not understanding or seeing how something doesn't fit. Because I don't think there is anyone who can understand the whole of it on the go to understand every detail it requires more watches. Exposition which Inception was known for, is dialed back to not try to prove this scientifically implausible idea but make you get it. It explains the bare minimum to be able understand the plotline but it doesn't try to give you a strong explanation on the physics for a reason. It is implausible and the movie sends the director's message throughout the whole time to not dwell on it, get the plotline and enjoy the action.On the other hand it still ends up diving into the questions of fatelism, purpose and real heroes which gives it a decent deepness as much as it is possible for such a idea but can still fulfill some of our big question thinking.It's unique it's well-executed, it's not perfection but it is as much as the idea can be. I'm more of a ""plotguy"" and don't prefer action but it was highly enjoyable after just letting go of the plausibility. It's unique it's fun it's cinema, definetly worth a watch."
438,"In pure Nolan-like fashion, this movie has called me stupid in five thousand different languages. And then laughed."
439,"Every movie where time is central to the plot, it is either too complex or is done 100 times before. However, this movie has made time original again by giving it a unique twist"
440,"Stop complaining about the movie being confusing. The plot is still graspable. No you couldn't get it in the 3 hours you watched it but, you get to obsess about it for the next week. which I find fascinating. Not many movies can do that. I say a round of applause for Christopher Nolan. Once again, you've done it!"
441,"Once again Christopher Nolan has managed to create a brilliant piece of art by bending the laws of physics and cinema to provide the audience with an immense and thrilling experience. The action and excitement which is present throughout the film keeps your adrenaline pumping, whilst the intricacy of the plot and time itself keeps your mind engaged and constantly questioning what has just happened.
It is an amazing film and like many others of Nolan's creation, is highly rewarding as the audience gets the pleasure of piecing together all of the clues presented to them - both those hidden and those in plain sight.
This film is a must-see and I highly recommend that you watch it if you're looking to escape reality in such sad times."
442,"I've seen other reviews saying it's better the second or third time. Therefore I will give this film a second go, however, on the first watch it is difficult to follow and characters mumble important script. I've never left the cinema feeling that disappointed and baffled in my life."
443,"I would like to point out that I'm a Nolan fan.The movie starts out good, some elements might be familiar to you from previous Nolan movies.It goes pretty well, it's interesting, it's understandable but not simple, the characters keep going and suddenly a scene comes in with the unnecessary purpose of explanation. While providing explanation of the plot, visually becomes extremely confusing. (I heard people saying they totally lost how and what is going on.)I also would like to highlight that important questions about the plot do not get answers, while I was waiting for it.So after that scene the story went on slowly because the movie heavily started to focus on action scenes. Which was entertaining but it became boring pretty fast.The cinematography due to these action sequences suffers a lot. I was not satisfied with the visual atmosphere neither.During the third act the action sequences going to confuse people totally. In my personal opinion the movie during the third act did not cared about it's own rules. You see 3 groups running back and forth, shooting and not shooting, the main plot goes on and Nolan distracts you for no reason with a nonsense subplot. Extras and actors running around not knowing what they do. It is literally visible on screen.At the end our characters end up without real characters. They do not feel like real people in a world. They do not feel like important people. They do not act like what they should have. All this filled with an OK dialogues at best! Sadly..So when you watch Bale in a Nolan movie, you see and believe you're watching Batman. When you see Matthew, you see and believe he is a father and wants to save the people and his kids. When you watch Leo, you believe it. When you watch Hugh, you believe it even tho, he plays a magician!In this movie, a character from the movie was highlighted for that he would die for people, basically. Later in the movie, he would sacrifice the whole world for one person, who doesn't matter at all in the story. And it didn't feel right in the story. You'll not feel and believe these actors.. Their characters are just too weak for that, the movie focused too much on the action and less on the plot and the characters that made Nolan's movies successful.The people giving it more than a 6 are DID NOT UNDERSTAND what they were watching. Their eyes liked what they saw and that's all.I also highly doubt that there was a test screening. Otherwise the movie would have been 30-40 minutes shorter. More focused on the story. Nolan wrote this script in a few weeks. Not years.."
444,"Imagine that you are in a hall, and someone is giving a speech by a dead language, for 2 hours and a half. Sure I can conceive your level of provocation. But what if after translating what he was saying, you discovered that he was speaking gibberish? Now, I can't conceive your level of anger!I couldn't understand a thing from this movie. While it's 150 minutes long, I have at least 150 unanswered questions. Every second is unbearable, with rare kind of bore; the bore of watching a running corpse that speaks cryptically and acts absurdly. And I didn't enjoy anything which could seduce me to watch the whole thing again. So as a movie that has leverage, through story or visuals, it doesn't!You read things like how director Christopher Nolan took more than 5 years to write the script. Ok, a right info, or a false publicity, both ways, this is so hasty script that didn't care whatsoever of building anything.As for the story, forget it, because the movie itself forgot it earlier. There is a wife who wants a divorce from an abusing husband, some plutonium, gold bars, a time machine, and unseen guys from the future. Now this gibberish was being said to you by a dead language, since the plot is tremendously arduous like a complicated maze, rather unsolvable enigma. The dialogue savored not telling you one thing clearly; even the pace of uttering it was robotic. And the editing is a villain, forcing me to believe that a computer did it all. Hence, the ugly result was robots that talk and walk, made by robot that writes and directs.It doesn't have the slightest dose of drama, overstepping abstraction to emptiness, transforming the essential into non-existent, and producing tons of confusion and repulsion. Can anybody tell me what's the lead's motive, history, or profession? What he was doing in the opera, or in the airport? And how does he survive death every time? Moreover, who is Neil? How the inverted weapons can destroy the world? What's the future guys' agenda? Just think: the heroine kisses her son, so we know that she loves him, but why not writing a situation to feel that?! The answer of this, and else, is laziness. The same laziness that made the movie's protagonist named simply ""the protagonist""!To save you more pains, let's jump to the climactic sequence: The shootout is a farce. I challenge you to comprehend who was doing what, or who came from the future to save who, and how he did it. The evil man suddenly monologues to the protagonist by a fabricated phone call. Generally, the movie has one of the biggest loads of fabrication I have ever seen. The editing is faster than your attention, and every attempt to understand a thing always ends unsuccessfully. Then a final scene that talks to itself, since the movie lost you already, and still insists on gibberish!Nolan seems haunted by James Bond movies badly. He thinks that changing the scenery, from nation to another, and stuffing the time with action sequences, yet without real plot or logic--can make an enjoyable movie anyway. But you know what? In Bond movies, we have more solid characters, even if paper thin, more comprehensible events, more dazzling action, and - most importantly - no annoying timeline!Speaking of which, the movie is highly annoying for the mind. The matter of moving normally in an inverted world is awfully fatiguing for the viewer, especially with the stingiest expositions, a cold-blooded killer of a dialogue, and that villainous editing!The reviewers say strange stuff. Some said it's about technology in our lives. So how is that exactly? Is it because the leads use cell phones for instance?! Accordingly, every contemporary movie and TV show is about technology! Some say that this movie is a masterpiece. When a movie is understood only by its maker, then is it a masterpiece or self indulgence?! Long story short, these reviewers don't want to look stupid, so they blabber about anything serious, even if it was imaginary.Btw, some reviewers say that the performance of John David Washington is good. What performance then? There weren't characters to be played in the first place. In this case, how come that any actor got the chance to show acting muscles, since there wasn't a body for him?! So when Washington was saying: ""I'm the protagonist of this operation!"" it was the top of naivety and patheticness. For me, his face was mute just like the movie's drama; so if he's praised for that, I totally agree!Virtues: I liked the first conversation between the protagonist and the evil guy. The mere thought of making a thriller through an inverted world. And that's about it.So what's (Tenet) in conclusion? I can't say it is a video game. Video games have more heat and fun. Their target is about giving you entertainment, not headache. And mostly they aren't full of pedantry and recklessness. Honestly, (Tenet) is a heartless, mindless, senseless, and joyless movie. Was it Nolan's hastiness, or ego? At any rate, the aftermath is a stupid movie that thinks itself intelligent, and if you asked me, this is the worst kind at all.It's not ""style over narrative"" as much as ""style runs over narrative"", and the scary part is that it became a tenet in Hollywood lately.P.S: How dare you reference (Casablanca)? It was a great movie, back when things like story and humanity were alive!"
445,Do I need to watch it twice because it made no sense to me?
446,From the beginning to the ending it was a ride like no other. Chris nolan has done what he has done best by making these movies. Tenet does not disappoint. And Nolan delivers
447,A bag of clichés stuck to a nonsensical or too convoluted story. The characters had no depth. The dialog seemed like a first draft. This movie has nothing in common with Nolan's past work. I had to use my covid mask to cover my eyes during the last half hour of the movie.
448,"Often the talking is impossible to understand as mentioned in other reviews so its not just me. The sound guy must have been asleep or lipreading. A good director trying to be too smart. I like sci fi but this is not a good film, more an action flick which is 50% of the time played backwards. One for Die Hard fans. Needs the sound redone and scenes re edited. Good performances by Brannah and Patterson wasted in an overly confusing and complicated plot based on an interesting time travel idea. I liked Inception but not this one."
449,"Was it the unintelligble lines over the deafening score, the tectonic plotholes, the hot garbage acting of Washington, or the absolute genocide of a plot that contributed to my migraine more??? Great teamwork."
450,"For Nolan this movie is horrendous. A syfy original but from the 80s without the cool action to make up for the lack of sense and script. Heartbreaking waste of a fantastic cast and cinematography. Budget must have also been huge but shamefully wasted. If you can't predict what's going to happen in this movie you've never seen a movie before, and this movie is not appropriate for younglings like this. Fake reviews are worse than ever unfortunately and I'm fully convinced Hollywood has been ruined."
451,I found the acting to not be great I didn't fall in love with any of the characters. Robert Pattinsons character was a stand out among all the others. Very hard to follow and drags on. I wanted to leave the movie early. Wouldn't rate this movie highly at all.
452,"This movie is critically acclaimed but I was just completely lost while watching it. The concept is fun and the cinematography is world class, as is expected from Nolan, but the plot makes no sense to me at all. I was so lost I fell asleep in the middle and didn't care about how it ended but one final comment from Pattinson stuck with me: ""See you at the beginning..."" Hmmm... Maybe I should rewatch this and give it one more shot?"
453,"A movie without a story, everything is too flat.
The actors are not good except for Pattinson.
No emotions, no hype..."
454,"""Tenet"" indubitably deals with a compelling concept. Dwelling in Time Reversal & Paradox theories; This will surely be an enticing yet too difficult of a watch. Reason? Some considerable issues plaguing the overall implementation!
As an ardent follower of Nolan's ventures over the years, I must assert, ""Tenet"" is definitely not the strongest he delivered till date! If I draw comparisons with Inception, Interstellar; this one fall behind in terms of presentation! While I sincerely laud Nolan's righteousness in trying different subject matters with utmost responsibility; I couldn't help but point out their conspicuous drawbacks!Keeping aside the negatives for a minute, shall we praise how technically well made this film is.
Mr. Nolan has always been aberrant in regards to the technical side of his works. Visually its a stunner with van Hoytema's customary touch in adequate detailings. Few scenes are Choreographed adhering to Inverted Time theory! They look grotesque to say the least. Soundscore being surprisingly one of the focal points in here! A glaring absence of Hans Zimmer is tellingly filled by Ludwig Göransson; who has done a terrific work, no complaints whatsoever.Performances are decent, yet nothing compare to what we already witnessed in Nolan's erstwhile projects. Characters lack depth, emotions; needlessly to say very unlikely of typical Nolan! Therefore, I was unable to root for anybody. For a Espionage thriller; it was imperative to do so. Screenplay is tedious, with inscrutable transitions taking place oftentimes; ultimately adding up to our destitute interpretations.The intellection is undeniably purposeful but a vague elaboration on the same; sticks out like a sore thumb."
455,"If you like loud bangs, explosions and shooting, go ahead. Christopher Nolan has made great movies in the past but this was just plain boring and very hard to follow. The plot seems dull and there even is a cliche Russian badguy... And nuclear weapons, weehee... I was really disappointed at this after seen the epic Interstellar and Batman movies. The reverse time thing has potential but this movie is just poorly executed with many flaws. And the screencast does not impress me either. I have no interest in watching this the second time in order to understand it. The movie really is that bad. B class movie, nothing special. I was hoping a lot more from the most hyped movie of 2020. So basically everything went wrong in 2020. :)"
456,"Like many others I felt kind of dumb after watching this movie. And I suspect that is the whole point. Nolan wants to feel smart by writing an incomrehensible story that only he understands. The directing is great in general, although I did get a bit annoyed after a while by the constant jumping between places (if that is part of the directing i dunno whatever). And the name dropping and little tidbits of sciency factoids is kind of silly as well. It could've been much more enjoyable as a simple action movie with a shorter runtime and if one haven't had to pay attention to every second.I realize I might have been too generous with my rating after writing this, lol"
457,"I wanted to like this as it was well acted and directed, but there were too many things that were incomprehensible to make it coherent:1) Why the fight, backward and forward? Why the fight at all? How did he know that it was himself?2) Why the forward and backward ending sequence? Did they know why they were there and what they were doing? It never made any sense to me.3) I never saw them get what they were after in the tunnel, so I don't understand how they stopped anything.I would really like to understand this, but too much didn't make sense. I paid attention really closely with subtitles, so I didn't miss anything, but I don't think a second viewing would really help."
458,"I don't agree that it needs multiple viewings, it really isn't that difficult to follow.
The main issue is the last act is a complete mess and letdown. The 'revelation' of the two masked attackers in the airport, Stevie Wonder saw coming.
I won't say too much about the story, that's all been written elsewhere.
I thought the acting was good enough, the usual Nolan overbearing sound design.
Branagh was sadly miscast.
Those giving it ten out of ten have to be paid for, it really is that poor.
I gave it a 6/10 and that's probably too highTenet is mentioned once in the entire movie, just another dropped plot point of many. Don't get me started on the 'end battle' against literally no one."
459,"Good story .. very weak performance
Did nolan lose his touch or what ?!"
460,"Who could make a movie like no one else can? Chris Nolan. That's who! This movie will be memorable in anyone's life. Nolan fans will sure as hell love it and others who is a sci-fi nerd will definitely love it. It's a whole new level of craziness brought up by Christopher. Screenplay is
unimaginably complex yet fascinating. Plot is beyond understanding for some but re-watching can definitely help, i reckon. Cinematography is incredible while direction is breathtaking combined with excellent editing. The sound mixing is thrilling but loud, yet intriguing. I'll recommend a 98% definite watch for this movie!"
461,"The Dark Knight trilogy, Inception, and The Prestige have always been favorites of mine. Interstellar and Dunkirk were great, too. But Tenet was overdone, extremely confusing, and for no real good reason. As soon as I started to track with the plot of the movie, a new twist came in to remind me that I genuinely had no idea what was going on despite my best efforts to keep up. My Fiancé and I considered leaving early since we were so confused and had no idea what was going on, that there was no point in finishing the movie. But as the characters were explaining the movie, oftentimes, people would talk through masks, thick accents or even walkie talkies to the extent that you didn't even hear their explanations, let alone understand them. The action sequences were pretty cool, and that's the only reason my rating went up to a 3-10."
462,"150 minutes of my life I will never ever get back.
No explanation of who the characters are and their background, no character development, no emotions expressed EVER... And on top of that the whole past, future, reverse universe idea makes no sense and just leaves you frustrated listening to nonsense dialogue that clearly is made to complicate things even more, not to simplify things. Give it 45-60 mins and you will zone out 100%.Conclusion:
Save your money.
Save your time.
Should not have been made."
463,"This pretentious action blockbuster is by far the worst movie by Christopher Nolan, and if you remove all the (undeserving) hype surrounding it, you will find a disappointingly mediocre movie with bad directing, bad screenplay, bad pacing, bad editing and abysmal camerawork. The actual plot is paper-thin and predictable (about a group of secret agents who must prevent an evil terrorist from destroying the world etc), but what makes the movie incomprehensible is the annoying shaky-cam that is dominant in most action scenes and which becomes even more pronounced as the movie progresses. What also bothered me is how most scenes end way too abruptly, with the narration jumping from one continent to another so quickly that the viewer gets lost in all the jump-cuts. Furthermore, the characters are all one-dimensional and everybody speeks in a needlessly cryptic jargon that's full of codewords and abbreviations. It seems to me that the whole story aspect about time-travel and ""reverse entropy"" is just a cheap supperficial gimmick that's supposed to justify extravagant special effects and draw attention from the movie's numerous flaws. I don't think this movie deserves so much hype since it's really a complete wreck with flaws in every department."
464,"People tend to admire what they cannot comprehend but it is an artifice.You can watch the movie twice and still spot the loads of quirks and shortcuts...I am a big fan of Nolan but this time he has gone too far, overloading us with actions and not developing the story far enough.This movie will impress people who are easily impressionable giving to them a false sense of complexity"
465,"A movie with bad acting, know it all characters with CSI grade dialogues, unnecessary final sequence, pretentious use of physics concepts, way too long and not even close to the quality of Inception with which it was compared in some article or advertising I saw. It is bad on so many levels that it breaks logic and its own worldbuilding rules within the movie.No redeeming qualities apart from eye candy showing off of how rich people live. Nothing is redeeming, literally nothing. Don't watch, not worth it."
466,Another Christopher Nolan masterpiece. Seeing it again next week!
467,"Edit: after learning about a real incident involving a terrorist attack in Russia that's is the EXACT scene as depicted in the opening scene it is incredible that this tragedy has been exploited where over 200 people choked on their own tongues and suffocated following the government trying to stop a terrorist attacking by letting 1/5 of the hostages die. And here comes dollar-wood here to exploit it giving no credit to the real survivors or having any sympathy for the families of the victimsReally really bad. I'm tired of these Nolan movies giving people the illusion that they are super intelligent. No one who has ever put together a jigsaw puzzle has said afterwards ""look how smart I am"". No if anything they congratulate themselves on having patience and then to do something that doesn't make them feel so empty inside. Also I'm not sure how he can get away with making a 200 million dollar movie with only 5 actors in 95% of the movie, the remaining being the ""big"" action scenes that make James Bond movies look like the most active thing in the world. But anyways if this movie is some kind of benchmark that the world pandemic is some kind of over with then yes, this movie is a master piece. But as far as I'm concerned people are still sick and dying all over the world so it turns out this movie is not smart, it's a lie to the same people that the director is trying to empower. Jeez, I hope no one gets sick because of him."
468,"If someone tells you that Tenet is about time travel, don't believe it: the movie is actually about masks. Fact is, most of the things happen because the characters wears masks or helmet that hide their faces. Take away this from the story, and it doesn't work. So Tenet is not a spystory, or sci-fi: it's a travesty.Tenet is what happens when an artist becomes so big that nobody can tell him anymore when he is going off track. I enjoyed very much all the other Nolan works, but this one looks just like a collection of his worst defects.Since time travel is not available in our reality, I suggest to hold on against the hype for a couple of weeks and to not waste your time in watching this movie: you will have spared a couple of precious hours of your only life."
469,"This was lifted off twitter but was the best summary of any I've seen:'Anyone who tells you they understood it is lying to you. It is incomprehensible. The plot, the concept, the visuals, all incomprehensible.And just to be sure you don't have a chance of grasping anything, they muddled the dialogue in the sound mix.'"
470,"A sterile film, without heart or soul. Story and plot incomprehensible to me, flat acting without strength, neither the ability to involve and excite. I see this film as an exercise in style that has gotten out of control. I loved Interstellar, but in Tenet I felt nothing but confusion, perplexity and disappointment. Technically nothing to complain, however. It may be enough for some that Tenet is a well-shot film, but for me it was a total disappointment."
471,"Nolan is the most overrated director today who's entire gimmick is exposition and then inserting elements that are hard for 90 IQ people to understand so they think he is genuis.Seriously this man cannot be more overrated for someone who has mediocre framing, terrible sound design, horrible dialogue, bad pacing, emotionless characters, a main character with no emotional arc or compass, bland visuals and color grading etc etc etc"
472,"Following a muddlesome terrorist attack on an opera, this unnamed chap (who I shall call Z) is introduced to the phenomenon of inversion. Inversion is the reversal of entropy, and can be applied to an object, a location, one or more individuals etc. This means that time can run forwards and backwards at more or less the same time in more or less the same place. It is dangerous: if overused it can overbalance entropy, which will end everything. And a nasty Russian piece of work is trying to collect bits of a mechanism so that he can activate an algorithm...Christopher Nolan's latest follows Inception and interstellar and, if you thought they were difficult to understand and follow, you ain't seen nothin' yet.Inversion is a great maguffin. The problem here is that in order to follow the story, you need to have an understanding of how inversion works, and that's exactly what you don't get here. In fact a lady scientist early on says ""Don't try to understand it, just accept it,"" and this is effectively writer/director talking to the viewer. I think this is code for him saying ""I haven't really thought this through completely, so don't expect it to make sense."" Given that it has taken him years to write this...There are various problems. Given that you have time running backwards and forwards at the same time, it's fair to generate an element of ""What's going on?"" to be answered when a reverse-time sequence unfolds in positive time back to its start at the end. But what I just said gives some indication of how preplexing the film is when much of it is told that way. A number of IMDB reviews say it was gibberish on first viewing, made sense on second viewing. My opinion is that you shouldn't have to see a film twice for it to make sense, especially if it takes a frustrating two and a half hours to watch it once.The next problem is that dialogue is mumbled and buried under general noise, making it nearly impossible to hear very necessary exposition.I'm not going to go on about this film which would have been a great deal better if it had been a great deal simpler, and which would have benefitted from Nolan having a co-writer on board to act as the viewer's friend. This film is NOT the greatest thing since sliced bread. I give it 5 out of 10, which is what happens when a 10/10 positive entropy maguffin meets an inversed 0/10 script."
473,It has probably been great fun to crack this idea and visualizing it....but it's such a lame storyline and it's at least one hour too long
474,"First off, I should say that I am a fan of Nolan and that Inception, Interstellar and The Prestige are some if my favourite films.But I just don't understand the thought process behind making a film so complex that the majority of the viewers are lost? A lot of fan reviews have said 'I got it the second time I watched it', but call me a weirdo if you like but if i sit and watch a film for nearly three hours, I'd like to be entertained, not confused. I shouldn't have to watch a film twice to understand it. Repeat viewings should be for enjoyment and appreciation, not to simply 'get it'.I also think that the story telling was quite poor in places. There were several times where something random is explained, or not as the case may be, and then used in a scene straight away after and then forgotten about. Why? And if for some reason you didn't catch the little intro for the set piece, forget understanding the next bit. But don't worry, it likely won't have any effect on the film and the next one will be along in a few minutes.This film tries to fit so much in and do some many clever things that it all becomes a bit of a mishmash and to be honest, gobbledegook. There are some really good touches and little set pieces, but far too many are just thrown together with very little cohesion or explanation.I feel that if Nolan had toned down the cleverness and made a thought provoking, twisting, but understandable and enjoyable film (Inception, for example) it would be a much better film - I just don't understand how he'd watch this in the editing room and believe this is the best he can do.I'd imagine that there are a bucket load of plot holes, but the chances are you won't know if there are or not! At least until your second viewing perhaps!In summary, this could have been a really good film with an interesting and unique story. But poor story telling and a far too complex plot prevent it from being so. Shame."
475,"As a fan of Nolan and well made time travel(ish) movies, i'm disappointed, i didn't care for the characters, we are being introduced to a new character what almost feels like every other minute, teleported from a place to place without much explanation, it's just not a movie that people should(could) like, but i see these reviews and am baffled by the amount of Nolan shills.Cinematography is on point but why should i care about that when the movie is a huge mess, during the movie it became very clear to me that this is a movie that Nolan wants you to see again but why should i? If the characters get no development and i don't care for them at all."
476,"Sadly nothing like the brilliant Memento or Inception. Loud, shouty, macho, overlong - and ridiculously violent for a film that's somehow got a 12 certificate. No, no and no - this is very much a 15. But mainly I just stopped caring if who / when / how, and found myself just checking my watch to try and work out where in the narrative arc weight possibly be so I knew how much more energy I needed to get through to the end. And just because you the Director are enjoying the coolly clever concept of simultaneously forward/reversed action sequences, that doesn't mean it wouldn't have been better with tighter editing. We got it - it was loud and clever. There were lots of explosions. Yes, ok, we got it. All very clever. Just stop it now!"
477,"When you mess with time do your research, interstellar did it better than this, a comedy movie from the 80's did better than this or at LEAST abide your movies science items don't have viable and changeable perspectives but people do so go off that next timeThe fight scenes without time stuff were great though it was not the actors fault they were amazing"
478,A complete disaster. The script is so poor that the way to save it was to complicate it as much as possible.
479,The movie is dumb and boring made worse by the music.
480,"Intellectual showboating. What else can I say about Tenet? Coming from likely the most talented filmmaker of this century, the best I can say is: he was due for a dud.Tenet has all of the visual and audio acuity and genius of any film by the contemporary prodigy, but even Nolan's best conceptual flexing flying parallel with his eye popping action falls flat without fleshed out characters - something Nolan seems to have decided is too base for his most intellectually ambitious feat yet.From start to finish you know nothing about the main protagonist, not to mention the characters he meets along the journey. If the anonymity of Nolan's chess pieces is somehow intentional, it's certainly over my head.Nolan is more practiced than any storyteller in the use of time as a subject of his films, but without the genuine human element (which, until now, he has more or less perfected), all of his action packed conceptual adventures taste more like gimmickry going down, and instead of the catharsis you ordinarily feel at the end of his films, you're left feeling hollow, like you're supposed to be feeling something that you somehow weren't elevated to.But you didn't miss anything, unfortunately. Unlike Nolan's masterpiece, ""Inception"", there won't be any rewatching to wrap your head around conceptual gymnastics and depth - there's none of that needed. Not really... Unless of course it might involve rewatching it backwards to reverse/inverse ones disappointment. I'd take that gimmick."
481,"If you like Nolan's movies, this one is definitely one of his best.The plot was peculiar but great. If you really want to understand it, you are probably best to watch it again.After watching the movie, I felt confused but happy. I'm probably better off watching it again, to fully understand it.If you are thinking about watching the movie, go for it!Only problems I had was the audio. It was too loud for my taste, might be because I was sitting quite close to the speakers, but I would advise picking seats at the cinema carefully."
482,"There were some Russians, some actors mumbling lines through masks that were probably critical to understanding the plot, and then some bullets flying backwards. Also a yacht.It's a convoluted, confusing mess and I wish I didn't pay to watch it."
483,"Tenet was just brilliant. It was the perfect movie to go back to the cinemas with.
It's a very high concept sci-fi spy story that involves crazy time physics, but I won't give anything away. Just know that going in, you will need to pay attention to every word to follow along and even then you might get lost a few times. There was a good 45 minutes I had absolutely no idea what was happening but I came back around to it. It's definitely a ""see more than once"" kind of movie.I absolutely loved it though. I feel like Christopher Nolan just became the Isaac Asimov of the film world. I get a certain feel from Asimov novels that I've never felt anywhere else until now. If you're a sci-fi fan this is highly recommend. It's the same sort of high concept, hard sci-fi that I love Asimov's novels for, albeit with faster pace and more punching.There were great action scenes, great moments of tension, some humour here and there. Extraordinary special effects and cinematography that coellesced into some of the most unique movie scenes ever. It's very well paced too, two and a half hours and it flew by. Every scene was important and nothing bogged it down at all.Brilliant score, this is one of the first times in a long time that Nolan hired a different composer from Hans Zimmer, Ludwig Goransson who did a brilliant, synth heavy score that I hope to find on vinyl. It really elevated the movie in numerous ways.Acting was brilliant, John David Washington is new to me but I'd love to see him in more films. Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki were great as well, and it was a nice surprise to see Aaron Taylor Johnson toward the end.
I've seen some criticisms that the characters aren't well developed and that is true, they're very bare bones characters. But I feel like in a weird way the movie would have been bogged down if there was a bunch of backstory for everyone. In fact with it being a sort of spy film, knowing more about the characters may have ruined some intrigue and mystery.
It's a unique tale and I didn't mind just being thrown in with these people along for the very crazy ride.Another criticism I've seen is one I actually do agree with; the sound mixing was odd and there were moments the music or background sound made it hard to hear the dialogue. I'm not sure why it was mixed that way but when you already had to pay attention really close to the plot, that added another layer of unecessary confusion.I had a great time, I think this will become a classic in time, I really do. I cannot wait to watch it again. I'm going to get the 4K and rewatch and rewatch and analyze it.If you feel ready to go back to theatres, this is the one to see."
484,"The way how time travelling works in ""back to to future"" is :the time traveller travells to the past and will return to the presence. in Tenet, its the same, but there is one more change: the time traveller physically inverses while time travelling. which means: from his point of view, reality in the past has inversed entropy: cold becomes warm, disorder returns to order. the time arrow is inverted. if he is driving a car forwards, all other cars are driving backwards.
John David Washington is perfect for that role, Robert Pattinson is perfect too.
a movie, one must watch at least 2 times.
The paradoxon logic reminds me of Donny Darko."
485,"This movie left me confused on the first watch, even the second. I find myself finding something new in this movie every time I see it, and I'm not unhappy about that. This movie makes you think, but in the end, it's a generally enjoyable film."
486,"A thriller with touches of drama, science fiction and action.
It is about an agent who embarks on a mission to stop the Third World War by obtaining a chemical element while traveling back in time.
Ingenious.
Quality.
Entertaining
Spectacular.
The effects are spectacularly done, as well as the action scenes and the stunts.
The script is fascinating.
The performances at the level.
It's one of those movies where you have to carefully see how everything Nolan does to make you understand him or you're going to get lost, you shouldn't even blink.
The only problem is that it uses the same formula in sequences and opening as in the Batman trilogy and it doesn't look as groundbreaking anymore.
Not to be missed if you like smart movies that will leave you wondering.
Talk about destiny and use the formula of parallel universes and time travel."
487,Sir Nolan always gave us extraordinary story and direction in their movies. salute you sir for entertainment.
488,"A great film as always and expected from Christopher Nolan. Nolan understands the importance of camera angles, heart-thumping soundtracks, effects, and overall clean dramatic filming. Superb acting from the cast. This wild espionage story is masterful and the action sequences were exhilarating. John David Washington and Robert Pattinson were just fantastic 10/10."
489,This is a must watch movie in IMAX to really take in all the work and professional stunts that went into this movie. The cast in the movie was absolutely perfect and really made you get behind them. All the action scenes really keep you in the edge of you seat and wanting more. The storyline behind it all is it's to follow and understand unless you are paying really close attention to. None the less go watch this movie in IMAX!!! 95/100
490,"As I have already read various reviews for Tenet before going to see the movie, I was expecting to be prepared for the confusing story line and all sorts of plot twists - I was not. The movie was very action packed, exciting and actually kept me on the edge of my seat through the whole experience.. I give it a 8/10 only because the plot and the whole time travel thing was so incredibly confusing."
491,"Brilliant cinema experience, with lots of twist and turns, the cinematography is incredible and with a great cast. This definitely a film I will want to rewatch."
492,"At first watch it is hard to catch up to everything that is going on, but the movie is very well put together with a lot of of thriling scenes and with an Oscar worthy plot."
493,"After watching TeneT, walk backwards to the ticket office, give them back the ticket and they will give you back money. In that very moment someone is getting into the cinema theater to watch benjamin button, a movie that will appear way to ordinary to his eyes. In the next room of the cinema theater they are also playing ""The goblet of fire"" and Lord Voldemort is giving back life to Cedric Diggory."
494,"Maybe it's because it's the first cinema movie we saw since the cinemas opened again, but it was difficult to follow and hear, i understand the director wanted to make a different movie style, but why make it so confusing, action was good as was the acting, the sound was way to loud to hear what was been said a lot of the time, which made it an okay movie"
495,"Movie was amazing, still thinking about it a week after watching it, soundtrack, acting, visuals, all phenomenal, and a really unique concept, definitely going back to see it again and again. Christopher Nolan is truly the best director in modern cinema and Ludwig Göransson really outdid himself with this soundtrack."
496,"You have to work so hard to understand what's happening you don't enjoy the film, could not wait for the end"
497,"I was hoping to see some sort of film with things blowing up and what not, but man...First things first, bring ear plugs. It really seems like the studio cheeped out and hired a drunk 6 year old to bang on a keyboard set to goth. There's one whole scene that sounds like those really loud old alarm clocks with the red digital numbers, but one straight tone for like 5 minutes erererererererreerngngngngngngngngererererererngngng. I highly suspect the music was there to keep you from falling asleep from the lack of functional dialogue.They all just made blank statements with no emotion. There was nothing in this film that could be considered a conversation. You had scenes with epic lines like,""What are you doing?""""I split something on the floor. It's slippery.""or the classic""I usually have soda water.""""No you don't""Nearly every line was delivered with deadpan expressionlessness. Edward the vampire was the only one who was kind of ok, but that's mostly because of his nice suits and he starts off by ordering booze, which I'm sure most of the audience, were we of the same mind, was eyeing jealously to help ease their pain.The last major thing that really grated on me was that the whole movie is centered around the word algorithm and not a single person involved in the making of this film appears to actually know what that word means, but someone thought it meant crank shaft.So there you go. Tenet, at least we know it's fiction, because I totally would have told myself not to go see this."
498,"Pure rubbish. All the reviews over 5/10 must be people who have no idea what real entertainment is. This movie is not entertaining in the least for all the reasons people have listed. Music too loud, dialogue incomprehensible, storyline impossible to follow and so on and so on. Nothing good to say at all. One of the worst movies I've ever sat thru and the only reason I sat thru it was because I was with friends. Maybe if your under 20 it is entertaining but I really don't see how."
499,"After reading the reviews of how difficult this film was to follow, before viewing, I watched a 15 minute explanation video on YouTube.
I still had no idea what was going on after watching the actual movie.
Whats the point of watching it if you have to see it multiple times to have any idea what is going on.
Badly communicated story.
I have no interest in watching this movie again."
500,I'm a huge fan of CN but he has outdone himself. unecessary visual effects. weak storyline intentionally made confusing to give the appearance of a great movie. VERY DISAPPOINTING
501,"Created an account to write this review.I think some of the reviews are written by devout Nolanists; blind in the face of confusion and lack of entertainment.I'm not sure if my face mask was suffocating me, or if it was the plot itself.For starters, you can't understand what the characters are saying, such is the poor sound quality.A HUGE issue on top is the film's cluster of a plot is that the characters have no depth, we don't care about them and they often seem as confused as we the audience did.The antagonist is a typical cliche of a rich, egotistical and power-hungry individual set on ending with the world. Oh golly.There is far too much left for the audience to assume, let alone given the chance to understand.I defy anybody walking out of a movie theatre to explain the plot to a fellow punter in the way that Nolan intended.The only redeeming quality is that of the production value. There are some genuine cinema firsts.Ignore anybody who says you need multiple viewings to understand the film. They too seem to have missed the point. People don't go to the cinema multiple times to understand a film before they can be entertained by it. Life's too short, unlike this film."
502,"Don't know why this movie has such highly rated reviews, was so boring and way too long of a movie. I don't think anyone around me knew what was going on and there was such pointless scenes. Was way too hard to follow and too many irrelevant scenes shoved into 3 hours. Waste of a day"
503,150 mins is just like a torture. It's too fast without leaving any emotion for me. I nearly didn't understand anything or know what to expect.
504,Like the rest of his films but this was totally self indulgent nonsense. Loud. Boring. Confusing. Struggled to stay awake very early and did not care about any of the characters (who were they)? Dire.
505,"I've just read all the reviews for this movie. People are either on commission or agreeable with everything. THIS IS ABSOLUTE RUBBISH!!
Bad acting. Bad editing. Bad script. Bad everything. This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen. There's no continuity or storyline.
I'm actually writing this whilst sitting in the cinema watching it. I would love to leave, but my wife's having some drinks ( which will absolute numb the pain of watching this).Trust me. Don't watch. Even the constant music will annoy you after 3 minutes."
506,"I'm a big Nolan fan, I would love to give this a review however I couldn't understand 2/3 of the dialogs because the music/background sound was way too loud!
Also I didn't feel ""attached"" to any of the characters (maybe because I couldn't understand what they were saying) I simple didn't care about any of them."
507,"The most exciting part of this movie was when I went to the restroom, the experience was very thrilling.
I also learned how to play chess during the movie, I had 2h30min to discover that I have a talent.
I also found the time to finish an essay assignment that was due the second day."
508,This movie is a complete waste of time. It made me never want to go to the movies ever
509,"I will admit I didn't understand the whole backwards time-travelling aspect of this movie, but despite this, it was still just an extremely boring movie with about 2 action scenes and the rest is just talking scenes where the background sounds/music are so much louder than the dialogue that I struggled to hear so much of what the characters were saying. So much of this movie just isn't explained at all. I'm a fan of most other Nolan movies and while they're confusing they're always engaging and gripping nonetheless, but this movie is an exception, I found myself dozing off in the cinema for the last hour of the movie because I was just so bored."
510,"I just watched it. Very disappointed, to the point I almost walked out. Didn't think Nolan could make a bad film but this was rubbish. Complicated storyline that wasn't interesting enough for me to want to watch it again to try and understand. It felt like half a film stitched together in the wrong order. Inception was a masterpiece of originality, incredible cast, great story and one you'd need to watch a couple of times to fully appreciate its mastery. This definitely fell well short of that. Seems to be the trend at the moment for trying to over complicate film making and focus on being too clever and original rather than concentrating on just good story telling. Didn't have a clue what was going on half the time throughout this film which just made it boring and uninteresting. The sound seemed a little off too but maybe it was just some of the complexity of the dialogue and fast delivery that made it hard to keep up? It seemed like there was a lot of exposition to try and explain the film but it was so poorly timed or delivered, that it didn't allow you to really grasp the concept well enough to buy into the story. Thought it was really badly cast too. Didn't buy the lead guy for a second and although Robert pattinson was okay, he definitely wasn't up to the standard of a normal Nolan movie. The actor playing the soldier was possibly the worst out of the bunch. Total cheese ball and very unconvincing, I thought he was an extra who'd been given a couple of lines until he actually developed into a relatively big character. Action was well shot as you'd expect which was in fact the only reason I stayed until the end. Definitely wouldn't recommend it but like people have said, it is a spectacle."
511,"I'm a big Nolan fan but he should maybe revise the basics of storytelling. Yes, this movie is spectacular. No, that does not make up for the lack of good dialogue, relatable characters, or solid motivations. This movie is a pain to watch because either you have hours of exposition dialogue delivered in the most robotic, bored way, or big, jarring action sequences (some of them twice of course, in case you didn't grasp the main concept by now) where we don't really care about who wins or dies. There is so much talk in this movie and nothing really is said.The science of the movie is fun but it is presented in a disappointing way. Characters throw in concepts randomly, seeming to be very clever and then we're just left there with them. This is complexity for complexity's sake. We literally gain nothing from these conversation. I could cut out entire sequences and make this movie half as long and nothing would be lost.The characters are ridiculously robotic and emotionless. Acting is great, it's just that there is not much to act in the first place.And lastly, sound mixing is so bad one thinks it is intentional. ""Important"" conversations are actually inaudible.When an actual line in the movie is ""You don't have to understand it, you have to feel it,"" we get what this movie is about: just looking cool but being empty inside.If anyone wants to see a time travel story that is executed very well, I'd recommend ""Dark"" on Netflix."
512,The main actor is too dead pan and this ruined it for me.
513,"The movie will last 2.5 hours, but be prepared to spend the next few hours reading various articles to try and make any sense of the dribble you have just watched. The dialogue is horrific with many critics suggesting this film be best watched with subtitles. The story makes no real sense with plenty of scenes appearing to serve as 'fillers' and in no way making any sense or benefiting the story. I would not recommend this movie."
514,"The thrilling action, acting, story and the amazing score by Ludwig göransson, is amazing. Tenet is complicated, you will understand more the more you watch it."
515,"I was confused at first cuz the story was quite complicated but I really enjoyed the action in the movie was really cool
But for the sci fiction it was confusing because the travel in time out of no where but then they got a machine like I was confused I wanted someone to make me understand what's happening so yeah
It was good though but confusing"
516,"Great movie, good acting, need to pay attention though, it's similar to inception. If you liked inception, then you'll love Tenet movie."
517,"I saw it two times in the theater with a week offset.After first watch i was more than confused, had no clue at all during the movie, thus was bored and thought i wasted my money. Luckily i watched it again.Not an average espionage movie, you can understand the timeline and the story eventually, but must keep focusing. I'd say the acting is rather adequate than superb, but the real show here is the story, wat is a little bit too fast moving for me, but a great film overall.If you like Christopher Nolan's works, especially Memento, then you gonna love this one, which i belive is the crown jewel of his kingdom."
518,"If I had the plutonium metal device thingy that they have in the movie, I would have my future self go back and tell myself to never see this movie. Highly recommend to not see if you do not have an iq over 200."
519,"When you're watching a movie and most of the time you're thinking about something else to pass the time, you know this is bad. Very disappointing for a Christopher Nolan movie... I had such high hopes. Next time I'll be reading reviews before his next film. Since this isn't a movie you'll understand on the first watch, I wouldn't waste money going to the cinema to see it. Watch it at home twice rather, your pocket will thank you."
520,"It is a good movie, worth watching. However, it is very hard to follow at times. The concept of ""invertion"" is realy cool, but I feel like Nolan has written a movie around a concept rather than a story. There are no emotional aspects in this movie, you dont know who the characters are at the end of it all. The movie is hevely plot(concept) driven.That being said, the movie is a visual masterpiece. The cinematography is on point and the score is amazing. The action is awe inspiring, especially the last act!In conclusion; I think I need a rewatch to realy understand this movie"
521,"It's the first time in my life I wanted to leave the cinema.
Basically, Nolan started with the premise ""Oh, backwards frames would look cool for a travelling to the past"" and didn't elaborate anything else on it. Just a waste of time and money.Maybe I was overexcited about the idea of coming back to an actual cinema in months, but my disappointment was so big that I left during the end credits, which I never do. It doesn't matter anyway, because they were simple white over black in an overused Gotham Font.That's right, the first thing I hated is the fact of a lousy Main Title over the face of the protagonist, with a huge action-packed beginning, without any type of intro or setting. They were so focused on creating a pointless time-travel backwards, explosions film that they forgot that maybe setting up an intro would help to get in the mood of a confusing film. I know is the fashion nowadays, but I think It would definitely help in this case.Then again, they were so focused on pointless time travelling and explosions, that the characters are plain and uninteresting. The ""super bad"" has to be an abuser (oh, no, surprise! He hits the woman!) and the hero has to save this woman, just because. Sexist approach, once again.I will finish saying that this Main Title didn't correlate with the Main Title at the end... The spacing and the look of it, clearly produced with rush and not paying too much attention."
522,Hard to like a movie when you can only understand about half the dialogue or less. Sad. There is so much muffled speech.
523,Movie is just marvellous. No words to say nolan magic has worked. Cinematography is perfect. Washington has done a magnum opus work.
524,"My mind is still reeling trying to make sense of what I've just seen.Tenet is incredible. An absolute powerhouse of a movie. The concept, the visuals, the sound, the acting, all mind-blowingly good.Sure there were a couple of things I didn't love. A few too many exposition dumps in the first half of the movie, a few cuts and edits that disturbed the pacing a bit, but honestly, none of that can hold a candle to the film as a whole.Definitely going to have to watch this again soon and do more of a review, just need to try get my head around it a little more first."
525,"This movie is the equivalent of seeing a steaming pile of $H!T and calling it an artistic masterpiece.This film is vague, pretentious, schizophrenic, scientifically unsound, pointless and utterly ridiculous!
The plot was deliberately complex without any substance, meaning or necessity.
Its utterly painful to watch, and most of all, its painfully BORING!
It offers the viewer absolutely nothing but a headache.
This is just a terrible, terrible piece of cinematic trash!
Its enough to make me want to go back into lock down.
Dont waste your time and money on this awful crap!!!"
526,"Sorry but this is a jigsaw of a movie with the pieces everywhere and you won't piece it together.Sound as well was atrocious. We lasted about an hour and a half and had to walk out, this film as no character."
527,"What a load of rubbish.
Doesn't even make sense.
I wish I could give it a zero ."
528,No idea what's going on. Everything is way over the top. Spend most of your time trying to figure what the actual mission was. Never again
529,Too long. Seeing the same scenes repeatedly is annoying and boring.Too complicated with no real explanations that make sense. The story unfolded slowly and poorly which hindered viewers' investment in accepting the aspects of the sci-fi paradox. There are many times the rules of physics seem to change in different scenes for the sake of having a desired action scene.The sound was a wall of noise that leaves the viewer exhausted and wincing to hear each word.Shallow characters. The characters have little to no backstory and no development. The viewer is supposed to accept that the main character is already the smartest guy in the room who outwits everyone while also being a master soldier who can kill anyone in his way.Not a fan. I think I'll re-watch Inception again to forget about this one.
530,"Self indulgent, pretentious twaddle. Apparently it took 5 years to write, and it will take longer to understand it. Far, far too clever for its own good. Loud, tedious and overlong. Dialogue worse than Star Wars and instantly forgettable characters. Dreadful - avoid!"
531,".. and not much else. Cartoon characters use wooden dialogue delivered like a bad OCR program.. Cliches galore, complete with a 7 ft tall blonde and a doomsday machine which a bad guy aaaalmost managed to detonate, by - wait for it - pulling something that looked like a bent coat hanger. Could he be stopped before clock hits zero? You bet!It has a general feel of a Bond movie written and choreographed by 11 years olds. The final shootout consists of soldiers running around like mice thrown from a basket and firing every which way at no one in particular. Half of 'special effects' literally got a second life by going in reverse.Countless plot holes are complemented by laughable voodoo physics even our stable genius would find hard to mumble. The time certainly stood still... and still... and still... Too bad you aged in the meantime."
532,"Not an absolutely terrible movie, but overly complicated and not very exciting to watch. I was bored half way through it. I have found the acting not good at all, almost robotic from all the actors. Lines were muffled and difficult to understand between the loud background noises. At one point I thought the characters were speaking in Russian behind the cheaply designed plastic masks or the words spoken backwards due to the story line. But no, it was English the right way apparently. Some action scenes were all right and kind of interesting when going backwards and forwards at the same time, but that's about it. Set design looked cheap to me. I was glad it was all over at the end, when the usual Hollywood movie end scene line was: ' Thank you, you saved the world! '. There must be a way to finish this type of tired blockbuster movies with a different line."
533,"The movie starts at high pace, throwing you right into the story, without setting much context. That itself can be a good approach to get you hooked, as long as the context is being set as you watch it unfold. Unfortunately that doesn't really happen. It tries very hard to explain a concept that's interesting but not as original as you'd might hope. Doing so the movie completely forgets to develop characters or motives, so it's hard to care much about the story or its protagonists. Great action scenes, supported by a Nolan-typical fantastic soundtrack, definitely carry the movie."
534,Probably the most complicated and cumbersome way to tell the story of a fighting divorce!
535,"I'll start with the positives, great camera work and very well put together.The audio was probably more akin to a pirate VHS film from the 1980's. Even with Dolby Audio, dialogue was muffled.I'm a genuine fan of Mr Nolan's work I loved what he did with Inception and the Dark Knight films. The story was garbage, convoluted and utterly confusing. It simply didn't flow and was a very hard watch.My mantra that I use on any thing that I watch, is that if the actors have to explain the story line, then the film doesn't work, think of The Da Vinci Code as an example.Avoid like the plague in the cinema, if you are genuinely intrigued buy the hype, wait for home realise and then you can at least rewind to go try to get a bit clarity on the storyline."
536,"I greatly appreciate Nolans work, Memento, Inception, Interstellar, all powerful movies that are visually attractive but also drag you into a great mystery, that you really want to see to the end in order to get answers. Tenet lacks that convincing storyline, the characters are empty vessels that you can't relate to and the action becomes a meaningless portray of ballet dancing with 'time-reversed' bullets. The acting is poor and the movie bores. The plot and the explanations of the time reverse are utterly far fetched and the film fails to captivate."
537,"Tenet's story is more complex than Nolan's previous works like Memento.Unlike the Inception or Interstellar,The length used to explain the theory is shorter.In 150 minutes there are lots of information,especially in the last hour.So after I finished watching it,I felt a little muddled about some details.However,Tenet is certainly a visual feast and you will feel amaing about Nolan's narrative structure.The acting of those main roles is very brilliant,too.And the music is really enjoyable.I once doubt whether the music is good enough to create atmosphere without Hans Zimmer,beyond my expectation,it has a strong sense of rhythm which is really fantastic.(PS:I think some of them even can be reverse played.)9/10,the reason why deduct a star is that there are some details I didn't comletely understand(I think I must see it for the second time) and Nolan's characterization of characters still have flaws."
538,Movie is so awsome that i need to watch 2 more times
539,"The epitome Nolan movie.... Mind bending story. Amazing practical effects. Messes with time. Awesome action.You'll walk away confused. You'll walk away thinking about this movie for weeks. You'll immediately walk away, wanting to see it again... and again. Because every time you do, you catch something new.This is why I love Nolan. Don't get me wrong, I love mindless action movies... those are great popcorn flicks... but you best eat all your popcorn during the previews because this movie needs your full undivided attention.Some people hate these kinds of movies... movies that force your attention, make you think, make you a bit confused. For me? It makes me feel like I'm a part of the movie along with the characters.The characters are just as new to these concepts as the audience. They're trying to ""keep up"" as the confusing world around them is shifting, and they're seeing things they can't explain.It's always bothered me in movies where the audience is one step ahead of the characters. You feel like yelling at the screen ""don't do it you idiot! It's obviously a trap!!""... we've all been there. We think the characters are idiots because we obviously understand something they don't.With Nolan movies that's not the case. We're just as lost as they are, and I love it! I love discovering new things every time I watch it. It's a new experience every time, and very few movies, if any, can offer that."
540,My rating says it. Just needed subtitles to grasp it completely.
541,"In the following I would like to describe my impressions of the film tenet. I saw the film on August 26th. After the long break, I was very happy that finally a blockbuster was shown in the cinema again - and then Nolan! I was looking forward to intelligent, exciting entertainment with an innovative story.
I watched it at 3:00pm, there were about 16 people in the cinema. Although there were always 4 empty seats in between (?), the cinema was clearly empty. I felt a bit sorry for it, because with that few people you probably can't even really afford the maintenance costs. Maybe it was just too early in the day.
Now to the film.
Shortly to the boundary conditions, after Internet the film has an unbelievable budget of about 225 million dollars, so almost a quarter of a billion - and that's where the problem starts for me. With such a budget, there must be no logical errors. I have no problem if the story takes place in a fictional world, in which certain laws of nature are overridden, or if, for example, beings with ""superpowers"" exist, as long as they are comprehensible, with a certain motivation and behave within the limits of this world. If the chosen world is relatively ""normal"" in its physics, like here in tenet, then it is also the case, for example, that if a figure jumps from the third floor, it does not do so without violation of the rules, but breaks a foot. This is for me part of the inner logic of the world resp. of the event and is for me the part, which makes the event (within its laws) logical experienceable and realistic. Likewise the actions of the persons should fit to it, be it that they are driven to actions by external compulsions, self-preservation or due to predictable consequences.
The actions and the physical robustness of the characters do not fit into this framework for me at tenet. Here are two examples. In the opening scene, our protagonist has the task of bringing an object from an opera performance in Kiev and its bearer with his team to safety. The performance is attacked by terrorists who shoot wildly around the area. Shortly afterwards, the building is stormed by a special unit. He and his team join this special unit undercover (which felt that 2 minutes after the attack they were already on site and of course stormed the opera house immediately), reach their target and could bring it to safety. At the same time he notices that explosives are being laid out throughout the building. What does he do? He runs around to find the explosives, gets into a fight with the special unit and the terrorists and, thanks to the fact that the explosives have a digital display, he can throw them (10-12 pieces) into the upper, unoccupied ranks at the last second (about 2s before ignition), leave the building at the same time and watch the explosion while running out - and you can hardly believe that all this succeeds. For me this is not necessarily realistic, but rather cheap showmanship, also because of the countdown on the explosives. This copy has been seen in various films from my point of view much more gripping - even if perhaps not with the optical stimuli - the concert hall was already impressive.
Another example is the theft of Plutonium 241 from an armored convoy: police car in the front, armored car in the middle, police car in the back. His plan is to wedge the convoy between different trucks in the middle of the city highway, jump on the armored car and steal the Pt241. Now Pt241 is not a harmless thing in the described world, and the policemen or special agents who protected the convoy are certainly no beginners. But here, truck on the right, no reaction of the escorts, truck in front, no reaction of the escorts etc. . Probably their thoughts were: ""Oh, they are driving up close, and another one... they don't want to attack us. Nooo, but not here with us, we are in Tallin..."". That's just way too easy, and that doesn't really create any tension. Of course the action succeeds here as well. The accompanying policemen weren't even stupid ""First Order"" soldiers, but simply not present in the whole scene, no fight, no complication, nothing. Thrill potential somewhere around minus 1.
For me, the portrayal of the ""super agent"" in the film called the protagonist was also quite difficult. After the action with the opera he gets into the hands of some enemies and is interrogated. Why this happens at a freight yard makes sense to somebody, if only because of the beautiful pictures. Anyway, he sits on a chair, his teeth are pulled out and at the last moment he catches a deadly capsule, swallows it to escape interrogation and then, bang, blinds and he wakes up in a sick bay on a ship. How? No information about this. And the best: ""by the way, we have also re-inserted your teeth..."". Okay, makes sense. Not that implants can take half a year, but maybe it was only the cash and the third parties.
It's just these cross-fades, hero in greatest need, actually death, and bang, he is saved, that make it difficult for me to build up tension or to feel it, because he is saved by Deus Ex Machina again and again. Another example: Car total crash, he burns, he should actually burn (or freeze to death with the inverse logic), and in the next scene he lies in the infirmary and is saved - good thing, because otherwise the movie would already be over. But suspense works differently. These jumps make the ""experience"" of the film and especially the excitement quite difficult or impossible for me, because nothing happens to it.
Or, to stay with the example above with the armored car, it jumps onto the roof, blows a hole through the steel and jumps inside. The plutonium is stored in another armored cabinet and what does the agent do: blow up, it worked just as well, it probably works here in the armored car as well, maybe 2 meters on 3 meters , steel around the outside, so a short explosive charge is attached, a little bit backed up, ignited, ... and of course it worked fine. No eardrum injury, eyes, hands and above all teeth still there. Either there is a physics in the film, then hold out, or there is just not, then we write Jumanji on it and well. For me this is not very realistic and a spoilsport.
Especially the things shown above are technical weaknesses for me, which should not occur with such a big budget.
People
On the one hand we have the evil adversary:
A Russian oligarch. He comes from a poor background. He has worked his way up and is also an arms dealer. He has a quite good infrastructure with trained combat teams and a yacht. The only bad thing is that he is terminally ill. His goal is to wipe out the entire world population, which is about 7.7 billion people. The motivation is for me absolutely unclear in the dimension. If I see it correctly, the motivation built up in the film is something like this: his wife wants to leave him and it is important for him that no one else gets her (i.e. kill her, which was not so obvious to me in the film, at least there were scenes that showed a different picture for me), then he is terminally ill, so he can't ""own"" the world any longer and so the conclusion from the first one: best would be to destroy the world, so that no one else lives either. Okay, take a deep breath, think, aha, supermotivation! For me this makes absolutely no sense, the motivation of Thanos is even more insightful (even if it was already moderately weak).
His wife, an art historian by profession and by the way quite unhappy with him so that she would like to separate from him. For me she still has a psychopathic disposition, because she cheats him out of 12 million dollars and tries to kill him on one or the other occasion. Probably with wealthy parents, otherwise studying as an art historian would not make sense. And it is just the woman for whom our secret agent endangers the mission several times and thus 7.7 billion people.
With the vita and motivation for the top villain probably not even The Asylum would have given money for a movie. To call the whole thing clichéd characters would be a pure understatement for me and wouldn't really do justice to it.
And there we are at the secret agent. His job is to prevent the end of the world in a secret organization. If I as a viewer want to be part of a film, the protagonist has to suffer. You have to feel his pain almost vividly yourself. Just like the world is coming to an end, he must also come to an end. For me, that makes the film, the characters, tangible. But here it is different. After the ""resurrection"", a scientist tells him: ""There is time travel, and by the way, the world is also coming to an end..."". His reaction is: ""ah, o.k., yes, yawn..."" - somewhere between indifference and disinterest. Rather beside it than only with it. What do I care about the world shown - and for me as a viewer it was the same when it goes under, so what?
An emotional connection with the people, with the world never came up for me. You have to imagine when you receive such information. How it can torture you, how you can deal with it, etc., that could have given depth, but none of this in the film. Unfortunately, this goes on throughout the film. I never had an emotional connection with the protagonist. The super scientist didn't seem to be the brightest either. Because the protagonist had to give her the tip to examine the metal of the bullets to find out who made them. Actually, I would have thought that when it comes to the mission (extinction of mankind), a highly specialized scientific/military/state team would have to work together. But apparently nothing, on the contrary the secret agent is told several times that he actually lacks experience. So it seems to me that it makes sense to entrust him with the rescue of the world - actually it is rather like this, that when a blind man follows the other blind man, both of them fall into the pit."
542,"Maybe I have to watch it a second time to appreciate more? Maybe my seat in the cinema was slightly too far back for the sound mix?
Personally, I didn't believe in John David Washington as the 'James Bond'. He was a little less suave and more wishy washy. Not quite stone cold killer, more mechanical like he's remembering his fight sequence.
A lot of dialogue is drowned in soundtrack and Foley.
Maybe the volume of information in the film was what made it instantly forgettable?
I'll no doubt watch again at some point in my life. Probably when it's on the telly one Christmas or Easter. Maybe I'll enjoy it more?
I wanted to enjoy it more and maybe the misfortune of having the next Bond film trailer as a pre curser to the feature out a kiss of death on it?
Overall a bit meh...."
543,"This movie makes you think its smart but in reality it is not and has many issues which are:1. Acting was horrible, especially the lead guy, his face expression are basically the same at all times, over dosing on botox possibly? the rest are not as bad, the best is the twilight guy and that is saying something.2. Storyline is very basic made complicated by meaningless cinematography, it will give you a headache not because it is complicated or too smart but because you will try to figure out where does these puzzle pieces fit in the movie on your own, so if you are trying to have a good time this movie will do the opposite. Plus at one point in the movie it seems like the lead actor is ready to risk to end of the world to save a damsel in distress? like really?So I will refuse to fall for this cheap trick of watch it again you will understand because there is nothing more to get from this movie except that it could have been made a simple family friendly time travel movie without all the useless and meaningless complicated details."
544,"This was a terrible movie, it breaks my heart to say it. Give me an original and meticulous plot, clever and colorful characters, and an ounce of the director's soul and I'm yours. Instead, the plot of Tenet was as if you asked your kids to bake a cake and they got a mixing bowl and added eggs, flour, chocolate doggy treats, tulip stems, a chair, and a Eurovision song from 1987. It was a mess.Plus, I didn't care about the woman and her child, though it seems that story line was central to the plot. And any baddie who uses the phrase, 'If I can't have you, no one can,' doesn't deserve to be in a $200-million movie.Finally, can anyone explain to me the purpose of the mediocre battle scene at the end - or even what country it was in?I was really disappointed by this film, though having said that, we saw a fox on the way home, and that was interesting."
545,"TenetDespite the hype and an incredible desire to feel the full force of the cinematic experience this movie failed to deliver.The main problems were;it was so derivative with collecting elements like a ""horcrux"" or reversing time to interfere with the future or indeed wanting the world to end on your death, we have seen it all before and presented in a more imaginative way.John Washington had the charisma of an empty baked bean can and the movie rested solely on this actor. He just wasn't ""sexy"" and there was little opportunity to be ""sexy"".Robert Pattinson was as stiff as Pinocchio before the magic, a total ""ham"" and Elizabeth Debicki had the look but added little else.The music overwhelmed and was grossly intrusive.The action sequences dragged with the same tedious trick used over and over again.My overall feel is we had little story, little character development and we really didn't care whether the characters lived or died. Of course Kenneth Branagh was brilliant but could not save this tedious turkey. Just because Inception was brilliant and novel Mr Nolan can't just repeat all the same tricks in a pale facsimile and expect the same praise or wonder this is not the mark of a great film maker."
546,"Cons:
I never felt connected with anything that was going on. People were observing time traversal and entropy decrements (causing the backward time effect) and they were all very chill about it.The villain was a horrible casting. He was the bad guy? You must be joking.The old-granpa didn't want to have a world without himself being alive so he decided to destroy the whole universe. Yeah, right ... great scripting.The background audio was too loud. 40% of the dialog was difficult to understand without subtitles.The script was too complicated for no reason. Nolan did that on purpose so people talk about his movie.I was too much hyped about the action scenes and I've got disappointed it. Look 20 years ago, Matrix 2 has a similar scene at the driveway, much much better.Pros:
Great musicNice surprise with the two protagonists, but nothing special either.tl;dr:
Nolan had great idea to play with entropy and time, but the movie was too weak."
547,"Nolan has done it again! Strap yourselves in and get ready for a thrill Seeking, mind boggling Adventure across continents and other things..... The action scenes are unlike anything attempted before woven with a story which you'd need to watch 2 or more times to fully grasp everything! Great acting from an ensemble cast that delivers from start finish. Lucky we were one of the lucky ones in AUstralia to finally get to see it after the many delays!"
548,"Saw the movie at a press screening and was not impressed. This has to be Nolan at his most ambitious, yet most formulaic (such a disappointment after Dunkirk). Action scenes, aesthetics, main themes, everything was somehow very reminiscent of his older movies. Counting too much on exposition actually hurts the plot here (even if you loved the movie you'll agree that films with similarities in terms of scope, such as Inception, were way more interesting), and the pompous finale didn't do any favours either. It's as if Nolan got carried away by his extreme passion for this project, which is not transformed perfectly on screen. Character development was non existent (main reason why I couldn't care less about their fate), but the actors did a good job under the circumstances. Even though Branagh was given a caricature, he never slipped into it; my personal MVP."
549,"The plot was ridiculous, physics dubious, relationships between the characters not believable, I never liked or got invested in any of them. War scene tedious, no idea who was fighting who and why. No culture, no emotion. Waste of your time, unless you like watching stuff blow up."
550,"After watching this film, I was surprised to find how many positive reviews it had. I'm not hugely critical of films usually but I expect a plot, or at least a decent meaning behind what is happening... A beginning, middle and an end would be a start particularly when we paid over £30 for the pressure, if you can call it that. With this film, you get none of that. Was I watching the same film as these reviewers that rated it 8/9 or 10 out of 10??What you get is thrown right into it, with little too no explanation for what is going on or why. Do they explain the purpose of anything? Not really. You should apparently care about the protagonist which he himself says that's what he is numerous times through out the movie because apparently the audience will forget after 20 minutes. The other characters are either good or bad with no inbetween with cliché lines that you start to wonder if the writer wrote the script when drunk or in a state of extreme constipation as the lines become so rushed that even when a legend such as Michael Cane appears, it becomes rebottic with no life. I wonder why he gave this film any time of day, perhaps he knew this film would be an easy payday. The script in general is just a bunch of rambling, in places it's hard to hear what is being said but all of that doesn't matter because everything that's being said makes no sense. The extreme music which for some reason happens when Nothing is happening, seems to give the impression that something amazing will happen but does it? No. The only purpose the poor choice of music serves is to distract the viewer from the terrible film they're watching. The music was so loud at one point, I was wondering if I accidently went to a rave instead of the cinema. The fight scenes were so robotic and anti climatic that it might as well of been two grannies fighting in a retirement home, I don't understand why other reviews mention good action scenes... They must have been watching another film. The soldier scene had a lot of shooting but barely any enemies, it looked like they were just shooting at empty windows... One soldier looked like he was taking a lifetime to take a clip from his pocket, I guess most scenes they just did one take and didn't bother to try it again. The 'bad guy' was boring and had no reason behind his character, I guess without character development it's hard to care or understand his reasons. In most scenes, he went from one extreme to the other with no reason or motivation. The 'good guy' was also boring and I didn't care if he lived or died. He suddenly cares about the bad guys woman, why? We don't know, the chemistry between all of the characters including the 'good guy' and this woman are either forced or non existant. Robert Patterson looked sauve at first but ended up being another character with poor lines and by the end, was the cheesiest of them all...miscast in my opinion. Perhaps the only redeeming factor is the special effects but will I be amazed by this alone? No. Just because you can use special effects, does not mean that you should over look other key elements needed to make a film good and just because you can use certain effects, doesn't mean you should. The time travel plot has been done before and in a much more effective way, with better acting. In my opinion, I would rather have a good script and plot than an empty shell with a lot of special effects... I was so bored that I didn't care about backwards bullets, by that point I was already looking at my partner sitting next to me and whispering 'do you know what's going on?' Of which he replied 'No I have no clue.' If anything we found this film to be a comedy and had more fun laughing at the ridiculous scenes where even the actors didn't seem to know what was going on. The amount of oxymoron lines used in this film gave me a good laugh.It felt like the cast did this film just for a easy pay check, can you blame them? No, after all it seems the standard of films has lowered so much over the past 10 years that there could be a film with just a black screen and there would still be fans... A black screen would have been better than this film. I found the previews more interesting, if only I watched one of those films instead. I was so bored 20 minutes in, that I fell asleep for about 10 minutes and unfortunately got woken up because of the over the top music that could have blown my ear drums. If you have sensitive hearing, I would not recommend this film. Actually, I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. Save your money for something with a purpose or meaning, as this film has none. Possibly the worst film I've seen in cinema."
551,"Firstly, take earmuffs or something. My mother sat through most of the movie with fingers in her ears, my ears have still been ringing 24hrs later! This was particularly bad at the start of the film - I was ready to walk out after 15mins of ear-deafening soundtrack, with no point to it other than to make a lot of noise: case in point the early railway scene. Seriously do we need the sound of 10 freight trains to over-shadow the action going on?! I couldn't even concentrate on the screen it was so deafening.Secondly, once you get past the horrendous sound effects at the beginning, the story seems like it is going to be ok, you can sort of follow it, and thankfully most of it takes place in the real world....this takes you up to about an hour.
Then the switch happens and you are forced to sit through the story you just watched in reverse and all jumbled up BORING!! It wasn't that great of a story in the first place, let alone to have to see it twice!
After 2 hours I was tired and exhausted and just wished I was watching this at home so I could turn it off and sleep - come back to the ending later- it wasn't like I was compelled to find out what happened....Last 30mins - as painful, loud, confusing, pointless as expected. No payoff, no explanation for how it's even possible that if one man kills himself then the world will end because of an ""algorithm"" that is already split up and hidden and nowhere near him in anyway and from what I could tell, not connected to any power source???!!! Maybe this is one for Wikipedia to answer! But really should we have to resort to that? A movie should be self-contained.
The worst part of the film is the ending. Especially when it was revealed that the ""protagonist"" would have to do this all over again on repeat in the future! Poor soul I feel for you...
What a boring life you will have.If you think I don't like ""repeat movies""
That's not the case as I really liked Edge of Tomorrow.
I've given this movie 4 stars for Elizabeth Debeki because at least Nolan had the foresight to put a beautiful woman on screen to add some soothing colour and help ease the pain.My mother (who loves Inception) has said this movie has done it for her now. She won't go back to the movies if her ears will be blown off. She'd rather watch Netflix now where she can control the sound and put on subtitles, if needed, for the dialogue. I don't disagree with her.The only reason we sat through this and didn't ask for our money back is because there are literally no alternative movies being released at the moment. I think any box office for this will be utterly false and due to Covid-19. I think Nolan knew this would be a flop if released with actual screen competition."
552,"How to make Tenet:
Step 1: Cool looking visuals
Step 2: Pseudo intellectual excuse for the visuals
Step 3: ProfitI can see why Nolan wanted to wait for a cinema release.
Without the big screen in a cinema with the huge surround sound you would probably notice more easily that the film is stupid. Really stupid.Rules get established, then shown, then sort of changed when convenient, then sometimes abandoned without explanation.Such as they need a piece, then all the pieces, then no pieces of a McGuffin for time travel.Then only future dudes can invert stuff, which you dig up from time capsules. Then that's not a thing then it is and isn't depending on the scene to have motivation.Inversion is for items only, then it's perception only, then it's time travel for people, then it's super common and entire teams do it all the time.It's things moving backwards, then it's perception of things moving backwards, then it's full on time travel.For instance, there is a word and a sign that will open the right doors and the wrong ones... Which is used once on a woman who would have spoken with the guy anyway. Then it never comes up again. I have no idea what the point was.Another total fail is the boat scene; neither version of the blonde woman needed oxygen so that the scene can exist at all, but before that scene it was mandatory to not have your lungs explode or to avoid asphyxiation or something.Overall I would say it was a JJ Abrams level of being cool looking but with a poor and ill-thought-out script."
553,"The concept of this movie is brilliant, but unfortunately Christopher Nolan ruined his own idea. He added heaps of silly details and then covered up the fact that they either don't make any sense or the explanation is stupid.He did this with multiple techniques:1. Cutting out parts which are crucial to the plot but would be impossible to explain2. Making the dialogue extremely quiet and complicated3. Not showing some actors the full script or making sure they didn't understand the plot to ensure they didn't know how to deliver the lines4. Filling the movie with excruciating sounds which block out all critical dialogue and distract viewers from the actual movieThese are the main things he did to make people not understand the details of Tenet. Please don't watch this and think ""Well I need to watch this again and understand it better"" or ""I'm just not smart enough to get it"", because the details you don't understand are intentionally made to be uninterpretable, and if you dig to the bottom of them, it'll be disappointing."
554,"This film is so far up its own arse. Yet again Nolan thinks he's being clever, yet again everything is telegraphed and obvious. It was that bad I fell asleep in the cinema at one point. The main guy is brilliant, the rest of the cast are pretty poor. The love interest was bizarre, and served no purpose than to make the mission more exciting. In reality he'd have let her die and finished the mission far sooner and easier."
555,"Nolan is one of the best actual director, but this film is weak. It's only his vison of a spy movie like 007 or mission impossible. Nothing to tell, only action without reason. Not the same Nolan."
556,"First of all: ""Tenet"" isn't the best Nolan movie, because the film has some weaknesses. But that's not because of Nolan's unique talent for making outstanding films. It's more because of the overambitious storyline, which is partly unfilmable. It was obscure in some scenes what you see. If the premise had varied a bit here and there, you could even let the story go through as a very fresh idea for a James Bond movie. For a Nolan film, it seems a bit strange. But in the end, it has to be said that such a story and this twist can only come from Nolan and the 155 minutes are already very entertaining, even if Kenneth Branagh is in my view a complete mismatch."
557,"Too complicated for its own good.
No idea what is going on as everytime someone tries to explain the plot, they're drowned out by background sounds & music especially with the cast whispering everything.
I've seen The Matrix 10 times & still don't understand it, but love it. This is just dreadful. Kenneth Branaugh is the only thing any good about it"
558,"Poor cast choice, weak and chaotic plot with some action scenes really boring, looking like underdeveloped, plus trivial dialogs. Mediocre production.
This time travel theme is so ridiculous and pseudoscientific that it's impossible to follow the narrative with full engagement because everything got its sense only if you blindly accept what the movie is trying to tell you, there is a huge lack of logical consequences.Also it looks like there is something wrong with sound effects, music is too loud. Basically Nolan made this film in a big rush. Protagonist as well as antagonist are really boring, hackneyed early Bond movies-like characters, nothing like Craig, Bale, or Ledger or Hardy."
559,"Wow this film was bad!
Like, really really bad!
3 of my friends left the cinema they couldn't bare to watch it to the end, that's how bad it was.
And I wish I'd done the same!
I honestly don't even know where to begin....
The script is lazy
Awful dialogue
The acting is average at best
The music is unbearable
Quality of sound and clarity is some of the worst I've ever heard. You can barely understand what half the people are saying.
The plot is ridiculous and confusing
Action scenes are boring, the whole Time Inversion idea becomes dull immediately.
This film is the perfect example of a director who has completely lost his way and run out of ideas.
I couldn't wait for the film to end.
Trust me, ignore the idiots giving this 10/10 this film is seriously bad.
Christopher Nolan, time to go back to the drawing board sir !!"
560,"But today it was a jumbled mess, with mumbled dialog. Makes inception look throughly straightforward.Possibly if I watch five times with subtitles I will increase my rating."
561,"First of all, I don't understand the ""hype"" around this movie. I went into it with an open mind not knowing what to expect and I was VERY disappointed. The music score was horrendous, the acting was a mixed bag, and the story is hard to comprehend with your first watch. This movie tried to succeed, but it crashes in burns in a ""stylish"" fashion."
562,"So disappointed with this film. Way to loud, far too long, confusing far fetched shallow save the world cgi nonsense.No way would I want to see this a second time to get a better understanding of what's going on. Life is just too short."
563,"To say I despised this film intensely is to be a master of understatement, something Nolan will never be accused of. Full of one dimensional characters I mostly wished would soon drop dead, infuriatingly inaudible mumbled dialogue drowned out by excessive background noise and a ridiculously convoluted plot posing as intellectual that you soon stop bothering trying to understand, it quickly comes across as nothing more than a series of grandiose special effects set pieces vaguely strung together by some recurring characters. Throughout the film, the nameless lead 'Protagonist' concerns himself more with the fate of one bland gangster's moll, and her barely seen but continuously and tediously referred to son, than his primary mission, which is only the fate of all mankind after all. I just wished they would die, quickly, hopefully with the same laughable speed with which our man unblinkingly accepts the breaking of laws of nature central to the plot, namely that time can be inverted, so he could get on with saving the world.The film is not without it moments and some of the aforementioned set pieces are visually stunning, the backwards/forwards fight sequences are rather mindbending although I found the novelty wore off quickly, but without characters one felt invested in or clear oration in any of the conversations that were presumably meant to explain what the hell was going on, it just starts to irritate rather than intrigue or excite. It is hard not to feel that the dialogue isn't wilfully inaudible, such a variety of devices are employed to obscure it. For example the usually most articulate Michael Caine, presumably delivering his lines far too clearly in rehearsals, is made to converse whilst chewing his food. His dialogue is still some of the clearest in the film. Perhaps the script was deemed so nonsensical that Nolan decided it was best unheard so contrived through thick foreign accents, oxygen masks, walkie talkie distortion and half dead whispering to make it indecipherable. The question constantly in my mind throughout the film was not 'what will happen next?' but instead 'what did they just say?'Before the film's big finale sequence the troops are given a mission briefing. From the ensuing mayhem one can only imagine that the soldiers could make no more sense of the plan than the audience watching the film (one member of which snored through the last half hour when I saw it, much to my envy.) For those familiar with Peter Greenaway, I found the game of 'cricket' played in Drowning by Numbers far more easily comprehensible, and that's a load of deliberate nonsense.After the dog's dinner that was Inception it seemed that Nolan had learnt a valuable lesson when it came to the making of the sublime follow up Interstellar, namely that simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Whichever way you read it, Tenet is at least two steps backwards."
564,"I went into this with little to no expectations and I was still disappointed.
Let me start this off by saying that I have thoroughly enjoyed 9 out of the 11 films Nolan has made. Dunkirk being the first one I didn't like.
Which brings us to Tenet. Its a needlessly convoluted mess.
The main characters (except Dubicki) are bland, the main villain and his motives are completely unbelievable and stupid.
The first half of the movie is just bombarding the audience with mumbled exposition, but good luck hearing it because this film has the worst sound mixing I've ever experienced. I've heard this complaint with other Nolan films and I never noticed it. In Tenet it is blaring.
Im not even kidding. Half of the dialog is completely unintelligible.
Even the special effects aren't even that impressive. Whoopty-frickin-doo its shot in reverse.
I genuinely can't tell you a specific scene that stood out to me."
565,"I've written several drafts of the review but I've decided to keep it simple, unlike the plot of this movie.
Firstly the acting. It's awful. John David Washington is one dimensional and wooden. Put a posh suit on a chair and you would have gotten a similar performance. He's not alone. Debicki, Pattinson and Kapadia are all terrible.
The sound balance is dreadful. Muffled and mumbled dialogue.
The plot is poorly laid out from the start.
I love Nolan's movies but this really is not worth watching."
566,The story is ridiculous. You will feel stupid through entire movie. Nothing makes any sense. The character won't help either. They don't even explain about the reverse theory that is in entire movie because they also didn't get it for sure. The bad guy character is just so cheap and horrible that makes you laugh. And as an action movie it is so boring that you wish that it ends so you can relax. I'm just worry about those pollution that they made because of explosions that harms the environment. Nolan should stop making movies and just take a breath.
567,Had the sound mix been a better standard so the dialogues were more clear then probably could have been more entertaining than it was. As such weak and unconvincing plot and nothing exceptional about the ending as well.
568,"I can only presume that they did a test screening and the audience said that the entire premise was ridiculous, the story was full of plot holes and the execution was dreadful so they decided to amp up the background NOISE (it wasn't music just random industrial noise) so that viewers was be too confused to understand what was going on and mistake that for a complex story line.Dialogue was drowned out by background noise throughout the movie, actors mumbling their lines incoherently with the exception of Michael Cain a consummate professional with perfect diction but who only had a cameo.Overall the whole thing was just a mess and most of the fight scenes looked staged and comical, explosions going on that had no connection to anything other than to display an explosion in reverse.The concept was quite straightforward albeit illogical bu the execution and the editing and audio track were the only things that made the movie difficult to understand for some people. For those who did not understand the first time round don't bother with a second watch its simply not worth the effort.What a monumental waste of money."
569,"After watching the movie I didn't understand anything , then my freind explained it to me , and even after he explained the movie to me it wasn't a good story and I still didn't understand it"
570,"In these pandemic times when the only blockbuster heralded as movie's comeback, intent on reminding viewers of the meaningfulness of the theatrical experience, turns out to be a soulless mess the nail my have been hammered into cinema's coffin. Truly tragic and sad as Christopher Nolan cares deeply and has been a stout champion for the theatrical experience. Unfortunately, by serving us up his very own version of a Michael Bay film (loud and incomprehensible), the last opportunity to engage an audience emotionally, reminding them of the magical experience of cinema, has been squandered. What we needed was an ET or TITANIC, instead we got this joyless experience. Such a wasted opportunity. Perhaps our last. I hope not."
571,"Christopher Nolan scraps character development and emotional values to focus, simply, on his story of mind-bending proportions. And for the most part, he succeeds significantly!"
572,I wish it was a litle more understandable and i am a little bit disappointed fron the plot
573,"I'm giving a 10 to counter the mindless many 1's this move got from people complaining its loud or too complex. If you know Chris Nolan and you are not smart or like an intense experience, don't watch it, but don't give it a bad review it only speaks bad of yourself not the Movie.First off the one major complain this movie has is that it is loud, and it is, but GLORIOUSLY loud, I felt the intensity on every scene thanks to the music and sound, I watched it with subtitles so I can say that most of the ""unhearable"" dialog, is not really that important, it is much more important to feel the intensity of the scene and my god does it deliver! It has been so long since my heart raced this much watching a movie, almost every scene is just as intense as the ""no time for caution"" scene in interstellar, which also has unhearable but not important dialog, yet it is one of the bests scenes of Interstellar.Second major complaint is that is not understandable, and to be honest is really not that much complicated, but a second view can really help to see the details and the reason this is just phenomenal. I mean you can argue that the story and script may not be exactly oscar worthy as it is majorly composed of pure exposition, but it is very well executed as it is and I dont like judging a film for what it is not, its like judging Schindler's List for the lack of Action, or Mad Max for the lack of Script, I mean sure its true but it doesn't make them any less awesome.I personally recommend watching this in IMAX if you can, be prepared to be confused and know that it is OK to be confused, try to focus on the experience it brings and watch it again if you want to understand things you did not on the first run. If you are generally close minded and like nothing but superhero simple and easy to follow stuff, don't even bother, but if you are open minded, like to think, to analyze perspectives and time, like intense feelings, and dive into a new experience unlike ever before, then I doubt you will be disappointed."
574,"I am a big fan of Christopher Nolan. I admire his commitment to practical effects as well as to original, thought-provoking storytelling on an epic scale.
His latest film, Tenet, has all of those aspects, but it's missing everything else that makes Nolan's movies so great.
When looking back at Dunkirk, his previous film, Nolan seemed to have shown considerable restraint compared to his usual storytelling style. Whereas in Inception and Interstellar, he creates these enormously complex plots, necessitating the characters to overexplain to the audience what is happening in nearly every scene, Dunkirk is arguably both his most simple story (get those men off the beach) and his most show-don't-tell style of storytelling. There's a lot to admire with a director stepping outside of his comfort zone like that. It made for a more enjoyable experience, things made a lot more sense for the audience, and all the while, Nolan still got to employ his signature time manipulations that he loves to do. Both sides (audience and director) are satisfied and some middle ground is reached.
I talk a lot about Dunkirk because in comparison, Tenet makes no attempt to reach such middle ground with its audience. It is a film that could care less whether you understand its concepts, or if you are able to keep up with its relentless plot... or if you're able to HEAR a damn thing that anyone is saying.
I give Nolan a lot of credit for being bold here. Few directors manage to convince a studio to give them over $200 million to make an original concept film. And this film truly is something original, with the action that unfolds on screen being like nothing you've ever seen before.
However, what makes action memorable is that it MEANS something, and that it's centered around characters we care about. There has to be something emotionally accessible intertwined with all the explosions and gunfire. But in Tenet, unfortunately we don't get much of that (with the exception of one emotional moment in the film's final moments, but even that doesn't feel earned to me).
Overall, I strongly urge Nolan to look back to his roots. Make an effort to reach that middle ground with the audience so that they are at least able to understand what they're seeing on screen.. and maybe add some relatable, memorable characters too. Keep making heady films that challenge the audience, but do prioritize an emotional core."
575,"Do not listen to the negative reviews; that's what I did when I just glanced at them prior to viewing it. My expectations were incredibly low as a result, but by the end of the movie I literally felt like this was easily the best film I've seen in at least 4 years- again, easily.Many of the negative reviewers will return with their future self inverted to change their ratings once they better understand the movie. Some of the most regurgitated arguments are simply untrue. They may sound good and may appear true on a superficial viewing, but once you really grasp what everything means, some of the most popular critiques fall apart.I actually want to go back and check out every negative reviewer's other reviews and see what movies in recent years they are raving about and rating higher than this and how they are criticizing this. In fact, I did that with a few of them, and just as expected, they rate some real stinkers and dumbed down popcorn flicks higher than this one, to say the least.Furthermore, I mean, let's all look at the last 4 years of movies that have garnered critical acclaim of any widespread consensus or that has been nominated for awards; think about the movies that have received high overall grades and ratings in the last five years. If you are honest they are all stinkers and pretentiously and desperately overrated. ""3 Billboards....""? ""The Shape of Water""? This is just to name a few of the forgettable, but overrated and overrewarded movies in the last several years. Most people will never rewatch these movies again, including ""1917"" and for many, even the well-made ""Parasite"", which admittedly was a pretty good movie.What Nolan has done here is returned filmmaking to the ""classics""- movies you want to rewatch over and over again. I've already watched this movie 2 times, and I am looking forward to watching it again. It's so well-made it is arguably a masterpiece.While the mumbling and slurring of the English language was definitely confusing enough by several of the actors (honestly, thank God for the lead actor Washington because if it wasn't for his clear English dialogue, I wouldn't have been able to hear or comprehend most conversations at all), the biggest issue I had was regarding how they were able to time travel in the final action scene.Earlier in the film, they show the portal that allowed them to invert themselves so clearly that was the mechanism and appeared to be the only mechanism to do it. But toward the end of the movie, people and characters are time traveling it seems at different locations without seeing them enter the portal. I suppose you are supposed to just assume they used the portal, but there was no clear explanation of how they got to those locations.Another issue that should also be touched on is how the significant lines of dialogue that may help expand on the stakes or consequences of the time travel are spoken so quickly (and then completely abandoned and forgotten about).Speaking of which, the girl, after being ordered not to do something ends up doing it anyway. I thought that was weird that they had her potentially ruin the mission on impulse. It seemed like it didn't totally fit the narrative to that point. She could (and should have) ruined the mission, but only a second later, it didn't even matter anyway. Anyway, the point is, this movie has some flaws and some inconsistencies so it is not a perfect movie from a writing or narrative standpoint.However, with all of that being said, I enjoyed all of the special effects, the acting was very good, the directing was good, the action scenes were fun, the overall idea and concept was cool and more intriguing than I expected it to be, and the music was solid.It's probably a solid 7/10 movie, but out of sheer ambition and mind-****ery attempted to get you to think and analyze which is unique and unconventional for a summer action blockbuster, I'll give it an 8/10 based on that entertainment experience.Also, should note: this has many similarities ironically at times to the The Dark Knight Rises, but also Memento elements. Finally, definitely an Unpopular Opinion, but I easily liked this movie more than Inception."
576,"I forgot to mention the action was like the script boring and dead, how anyone could find a redeeming quality in this movie is beyond comprehension it is simply one of the most appalling loud cinematic failures of all time which I guess is why people walked out and the cinema auditorium was basically empty."
577,"I'm not sure why Christopher Nolan would want kids to see this film, it's not easy to follow even for adults. A movie that requires multiple viewings to be appreciated is not a well-made flick.
I've been following Nolan's films for years, but sadly, his last few films have been more misses than hits. He may want to start collaborating with others, especially when it comes to dialogue and fleshing out the characters, and maybe getting a coherent story.
The concept of reverse time may sound interesting, and look cool in a 2 minute trailer, but in this movie, it's almost like an afterthought, in much of the middle of the film. And when it is used, it's very confusing, the explanations for how it came to be, and the rules of this world, don't make much sense. It's like Inception, you just have to accept that people are able to do what they do, without questioning the logic or science behind it.
This is basically a fantasy film, with a few flaws. For example, there was one scene that was a real head scratcher, when a bunch of trucks surrounded a police convoy. They were literally surrounding this convoy for several miles, and none of the police felt like they were in danger or radioing for back ups?! And by the time they figured something was wrong, it was too late. Too convenient.
Also, I didn't understand why they needed to take an injured friend to a place they were at earlier, only to reveal what was pretty much a predictable twist. And why didn't the people around them notice the strange people walking backwards? lol
None of the characters are all that interesting or engaging. Honestly, I wasn't even rooting for anyone or any outcome, because I really didn't feel connected to the story. Too much work trying to follow what was happening took me out of the film, I didn't feel the world Nolan set up, was drawing me in.
The ending felt very anticlimactic, we basically just have to accept that what just transpired was for the good of mankind.
All very strange, not realistic, not even engaging. Technically, the film looked great. Especially in IMAX. But as many have pointed out, the sound mix is atrocious. Reminds me of Interstellar, with that low rumble hum, passing as incidental music, drowning out the dialogue."
578,"The concept in this film without giving anything away is really interesting and fascinating to watch. But for me the way it unfolds is a bit like reading a revelation in a book you're not sure is a big deal, flicking back through the pages, and realising it is. As it's a film you have to unpack any big moment while the scene continues. It's a spectacle at times but for me the action sequences aren't as spectacular as any other recent Nolan film, which does let it down a bit. Performances are great and the soundtrack is fascinating, but the characters are a little thin and there isn't that much of a plot going on really that makes sense to drive the plot forward in a natural way."
579,"Another lame C. Nolan movie, overhyped and overrated.This guy is obsessed with things going in reverse, time paradoxes and things like that. What about adding some substance to his next movie instead of keeping playing these silly brain stunts?Good cinema is not about solving silly puzzles and showing actions backward and upside down.Boring as hell. Don't waste your money."
580,The title gives you a hint of what the theme of the movie is. This movie was so good and so clever! I haven't seen an action thriller this good in so long! Christopher Nolan makes the best action thrillers hands down! The special effects are mind boggling per usual in a Christopher Nolan movie. He never misses and takes his time when making these classic movies. I am still wondering how they did the things they did in this movie! It is a mind boggling thriller with a story and fleshed out characters. Check it out! You are in for a treat.
581,I did not like this movie. The acting was very good but the plot was confusing and convoluted. It was a 2 hour headache with nothing coming of it. Kinda like sitting on a toilet and farting.
582,"I've never lost touch with the plot of film so badly as on this one. Some stunning visuals, awesome effects, and great performances ( even if I wasn't sure what they were doing) and spectacular sound
Anytime anyone was wearing a mask ( and this happens a lot) their voice is muffled. I know this is accurate , but whats the point fi you can't hear what they say? I thought the device of them running backwards was silly. It felt like they did it because they could.
If your average film goer can''t follow the plot after one viewing, it's just wrong.
If you can't tell the story in 120 minutes, then there has to be a good reason, why , and for me there wasn't. If I wasn't enjoying my first cinema experience since lockdown, at 60 minutes I would have gone for a coffee.
Go, enjoy the experince , and the visuals , but have a low bar for the plot."
583,"(No spoilers included, I cannot possibly spoil a movie I did not even understand)I've been a huge fan of Nolan ever since Doodlebug, but this man's obsession with time is why I can no longer sleep ever since I saw Tenet. What sets Nolan's movies apart is that you're not just watching, or even experiencing them - you're also constantly trying to figure them out throughout it's runtime (and some more). And that process has always been fulfilling and gratifying for me. I personally love movies that entertain me while also blowing my mind - the kind of movies that still seem new on a second or a third watch.However, Tenet was simply incomprehensible - most probably because the dialogues weren't audible to anyone in the theatre. At first, I imagined this was a problem with the cinema I visited, but multiple reviews from Australia mention this. Also, the cast is wearing masks for most of it, so this should have been accounted for. I don't know how a movie that managed to deal with a complex shooting script and intricate visual effects completely messed up simple sound mastering.I dearly hope that with decent audio, and/or subtitles, Tenet makes sense. But if not, then I think we ought to praise films that are great and also tough to understand, instead of praising films just because they were dealing with complex physics, and made no sense. We should not be rewarding movie's simply on their virtue of being hard to understand.However, to Tenet's credit - the movie is largely entertaining, even though it's annoying and frustrating to not understand the context for most of it. It is engaging and grasping, even with inaudible dialogues. The cinematography is a visual art piece, and the main cast does a phenomenal job.Again to Tenet's credit, watching the trailer after the movie (In true Tenet time inversion style) was helpful. I have never before understood more from a trailer, than I have from a movie. I cannot wait for my future self to watch this movie again, either with half-clear audio or subtitles - and figure out if Tenet is a magnificent movie that has scope for comprehension, botched just because of an amateur mastering error, or if it was always made to be hailed as genius just because it is inherently incomprehensible.In summary, Tenet is like your last relationship -
You're glad you experienced it for it was entertaining and interesting at times, even though at the end you were left feeling empty and unsatisfied, for you did not understand or get anything out of it - and are now constantly wondering if it was you or just the relationship that was flawed."
584,"I didn't know I was going to a time travel movie, I love stories about time travel. I did not love this movie. It had potential, it looked really slick. The actions scenes were awesome, some of the coolest action sequences out there. I wasn't a fan of the villain, Kens Russian bag guy routine was extremely heavy handed but he was probably written that way. It was cool to see Edward, I mean R Patz in an action role and John Washington was amazing so the movie was well acted but it was just too damn hard to follow. You can't really sit back and enjoy a film when you have to work on your masters in experimental physics just to understand what's going on. Ok, is that guy going forwards? Who's going backwards? If he's been through the thingy why is he moving in that direction, not this direction? How'd they fit several dozen people through the thingy? Why aren't people noticing other people going backwards? Bad editing also got in the movies way, as did bad sound. The music and explosions were WAY too loud and the talking way too quiet. They were probably explaining something important about simultaneous backwards/forwards timey wimey stuff during the many, many chunks of dialog that I couldn't hear. The time travel machine was also way over simplified and was basically just a smallish revolving door? That somehow got several dozen army people and their equipment through it?? If they had simplified the time travel stuff a bit, it would have been a really really fun action movie. It was also a very long movie, too long to be trying to puzzle out what's going on. That being said, it's been eight months since I saw a movie in the theatre and so I was just happy to be there. Otherwise, I just may have walked out so I could google the plot just to figure out what the hell was going on."
585,"An absolute masterpiece from Nolan, the audio from the actors may need a fix. James Bond style + Time Inversion + Pure Action!YOU NEED TO SEE THE MOVIE AT LEAST TWICE TO GET IT!!!!"
586,"Nolan's worst work so far, poor acting poor execution poor script (overused concepts like grandfather paradox referenced several times...) the story overly and unnecessarily complicated which added no value to the experience, only some big expensive explosions, very expensive scenes and mildly interesting sound."
587,Once more Christopher Nolan proves his talent and making.TIME BLEND invention and manipulate method are perfectly balanced.
588,"From plot to dialogues to character building to film music, Hollywood shows it has rarely anything valuable from artistic and aesthetic point of view to add.If you are addicted to losing time and money watching harsh, senseless stories and actions by unsavory actors that lead you nowhere as well as listening to harsh sounds instead of a sensational good music that create a meaningful atmosphere then go and see Tenet without complaining."
589,"...in the middle of the movie. Nolan is one of my favourites, but he doesn't know where to draw the line. I could not enjoy the movie because I had to explain to myself what is going on in the movie, it was too confusing."
590,"Tenet is hypothetically hypothetical. It requires the audience to be in a meditative attention to grasp the fast and non-repetitive narrative. It's definitely not a movie to wind down with after a long day. Due to the complexity of the narrative, there was little scope for acting, and the characters were talking all the time to explain the situation. The dialogues might actually sound normal if the movie is slowed down to 0.8x. It has ten hours worth of story-telling crammed into 2.5 hours. Imagine 26 episodes of Dark crammed into 2.5 hours, editing out the gorgeous Lisa Vicari (Martha). Or X-Men without Wolverine and Mystique."
591,"A lot of people here are saying something along the lines of ""it's a really hard movie to understand. Definitely requires multiple viewings. 8/10."" This is bizarre to me. I like movies that twist and turn in ways that make me want to watch them again. I do not like movies that are so intentionally convoluted that they are impossible to decipher on a first pass.I don't want to watch this movie again. Why would I? The sound design was terrible, with key plot -conveying dialogue being totally unintelligible. The characters weren't compelling at all and moved passively through the story. There's some really cringy dialogue in there as well: ""It's a cold war, cold as ice."" Bruh. And the narrative is honestly not very well constructed. Not because its confusing, but because nothing is built up properly. Every plot point happens and resolves almost immediately after its introduces, with no time for the stakes, urgency, or rules to be established.I'm not gonna bother pretending I fully comprehended this movie. Too many big ideas were crammed into it, with no space for them to be properly presented to the audience. A lot of people will rate this movie highly because they done want to feel stupid. I am not one of them.4/10. If I wanted something that needed to be viewed multiple times to make any sense, I'd just watch a Joe Biden town hall."
592,"Christopher Nolan' films are usually a cerebral treat. This man has a great imagination but he lets himself down big time with this one. I found myself irritated at how unnecessarily wordy the dialogue was. Every single character reems off line after line in a very mechanical fashion and you know they have no clue what they are saying! Lines are read and facial expressions change infrequently. Kenneth Branagh lectures far too much and the conversation between him and his wife at gunpoint is unrealistic, his phone conversation at the supposed end of the world far too preachy, and his accent is terrible. Michael Caine is thrown in for posterity but delivers all his lines through a mouthful of food in a bid to disguise a noticeable change in his speech, which I suspect is due to a new set of teeth.I don't see the point of this film. I spent the first hour trying to understand who were the villains/good guys and why? What is at stake? How is it going to be WW3? I found it hard to care what was going on or about any of the characters. That being said, Aaron Taylor Johnson played a good role. I believed he was a soldier and I was engaged. It felt as though the other actors knew I was watching and weren't really trying. Lines are mumbled, muttered and almost inaudible at times. There's too much trying to be cool and sound cool, lecturing the audience and assaulting our ears.Scenes flit from one location to another and from one day to the next. It feels like a very messy film that is trying very hard to showcase someone's intelligence rather than to entertain. There was a brief point when things got interesting and that was when you see the inversion machines used.I think Nolan has to employ more show and less tell."
593,"It is obviously a big&amazing production, but once said this, why will you spend so much money and don't give a little more to the dialogs and character deepness....i felt disappointed in this. So many clichés... Seemed a little like a blockbuster remix. I could just get to feel with Pattison acting. He is really good, even with the small texts he got to say."
594,"It turns out that I wasn't the only one who couldn't hear what the characters were saying.
True to form, Nolan makes another film that makes no sense while trying really hard to be smart."
595,Terrible execution. So much talking and the story still isn't told well. Music playing during fight scenes totally ruined them and the background noises always too loud when characters were speaking meant you couldn't quite interpret what they were saying. Oh yeah and the acting was terrible.
596,"Im a huge Nolan fan and work in the industry. As a screenwriter, one of the most important things you ask yourself is...did it make sense? Would the audience understand it? This is ultimately where Nolan dropped the ball. Good effort, horrible execution. The timelines were insanely hard to figure out.Music was a bit out there but it seems Nolan was experimenting with a new composer than he traditionally works with. They had a unique path that many seem to not resonate with.When i heard about John David Washington getting the lead role, i was pretty excited. He looked good in the trailers. To my dismay, his lackluster skills in acting for this particular role was absolutely dreadful. It was literally like watching someone directly reading off a script during rehearsal. Mainly in dialogue. Action sequences were fine.As for the rest, cinematography to production...all top notch, as expected.Glad this was free for me. Looking forward to Nolan's next project."
597,"They even had the imbecile drive to insert some pseudo-scientific lines derived from reknown phisicists Feynmann/Wheeler, without having any clue of what they're talking. All the dialogue lines are disgusting, cheap cliches...Why ? Because of a such targeted illiterate audience, even from the Sci-Fi point of view. An entierly kitsch !"
598,Sorry Iv'e always thought Nolan to be a great filmmaker but this one i just to complex. And John Davis Washington is so overrated. His performance in this movie is really terrible.......
599,"1. Ridiculous premise. Ridiculously bad physics. A Flux Capacitor would make more sense.
2. The lead actor has zero charisma and is completely out of his depth. Terrible choice to lead an action film.
3. Kenneth Branagh is laughably bad as the villain. All that was missing was a curled mustache so he could twirl at as he spat out his horrible villain-cliche lines.
4. The ""plane crash"" that is suppose to be so great was limpingly bad. It was basically an oversized vehicle very slowly running into a fake building. It never even left the ground! May have as well been a bus. What a overblown, overrated stunt.Christopher Nolan has become too full of himself.P.S. I'm writing this before I've seen the film. That's how the ridiculous physics works, right?"
600,"You don't know what's going on and neither do the characters. Halfway through the movie things started to make marginal sense, but by that time you've lost all interest. I found relief in the fact that other people complain about the audio as I started to think my English had gotten worse. I wish I knew beforehand this was made by the same guy that did Interstellar as I hated that movie. This one was only slightly better. I identify with what is said in other reviews: there is no character development, everything is flat and uninteresting. I saw a couple walk out, a person going to the bathroom and I personally was stuck because my friend who also disliked the film didn't want to leave. Note that due to covid, there was almost no one in the theater. I really don't understand how this can get a 7,8 rating!"
601,"Don't get me wrong this film is mostly amazing, the acting, the CGI, and the creativity put into this film. But my criticism for this film is this film is that it's so complex it will leave newcomers like me befuddled as to what just happened. I had to watch this twice and yet I was still confused at what just happened. I had to watch a Youtube video about tenet to explain step by step on what happened. After that I realized its a masterpiece. I recommend this 10/10 BUT MAKE SURE YOU WATCH THIS TWICE."
602,"Whether or not you believe in free will the movie doesn't so be aware of thatGreat complicated movie, if you like those you will probably like this, if you don't you will be probably be truly lostI heard that the voice audio was pretty bad, i personally didn't notice because of subtitles, but maybe you will be a lot more confused than i was if you can't hear what they are saying"
603,"Tenant is an explosive mind-boggling thriller that will keep you're vains full of adrenaline from the beginning scene to the very end! this movie is a ride through time that completely takes over your mind! only real complaint I had is it's extremely loud, so loud that at times you can't understand what they were saying in the middle of a action scene so it was hard to follow at times..but once you catch up to speed it's a classic Christopher Nolan high tension ride that you will surely hop back on as soon as it hits 4K Blu-ray just to catch the little things you missed."
604,"Usually Christopher Nolan movies are better the second time, but I'm not sure I want to sit through that for anther two and a half hours. There was basically music playing the entire time which wasn't appropriate for the situation."
605,Tenet is visually a very brilliant movie. The movie contains Nolan's genius and a superb soundtrack. The movie has enough twists and turns to keep you at the edge of your seat. Overall a very good mind bending movie.
606,Looks like people are just saying this is fantastic based on the name of Christopher Nolan. He's a fantastic filmmaker and has made some brilliant films. This ain't one of them. A very pretentious movie that's beautifully shot with an excellent thumping soundtrack. However it feels unnecessarily complex with a lot of exposition none of which explains anything making you think you missed something. Well you didn't it's just designed to make you think you did. You may feel thick with a need to rewatch but if you think about it the plot is not that complicated. It's just put together in a fragmented way. Performance wise Washington Is good but not consistently brilliant throughout. Patterson lacks something and the posh British accent is a bit fake. Kenneth Is alright nothing special going on with him either. Aaron (kick ass) looked like he didn't really care delivering his lines like he was in a hurry to go home. After this I watched 'Unhinged' enjoyed it much more plus Russell Crowe was horribly awesome. Take care folks ...
607,"Tenet is a visually stunning film with great cast and music that gives you goosebumps. What it really fails to do is to establish any meaningful emotional connection with the audience. The protagonist's motivations are flat and all ""we've seen it before"". Throughout the film you don't really have a chance to empathize with him. And the main ""villain's"" motivations are outright dumb. Nolan made me cry in his Batman trilogy not once, so it's even more disappointing to have characters with whom you cannot feel any sort of connection.That said, go to the cinema and watch the film yourself to make your own opinion about the story and enjoy the things I've described in the beginning of this review."
608,"Ouch, Ow! My simple human brain..For those who feel Nolan is a director that makes his movies unnecessarily complex should be warned, he could honestly care less. 'Tenet' is as complicated and mind boggling as it gets.Though for what has been something of a staple for Nolan, however intricate his movies may be, the plot is actually almost always a simple one.'Inception' is about a man trying to get home to his children. 'Interstellar' is about a group looking for an alternate planet. 'Batman Begins' is about Zap, Boom, Pow and also about facing your personal demons and such.'Tenet' is about saving the world and that's all you really need to know.The real question is, does it work? The answer, ironically, only the future will tell. There is too much too compact in a single viewing to really know if it all makes sense (at least in the case for my tiny man brain). First round opinions may come down to how much faith you have in Nolan. His past movies have proven he's a director all about the details, so it's hard to believe there isn't logic and structure all up in this beast.About the only thing that is for certain is the scale and blockbuster pizzaz. People fight forward in time, people fight backwards. People move forward in time while fighting people moving backwards. It's simply insane to watch the sheer scale of these ideas unfold on screen. Price of admission insane. The Nolan pizzaz has yet to disappoint.***No spoilers, but I will hint at the standout moment..... A bleeding arm, a helmet and a call back. Genius!***Also on screen are a cast of gifted actors, working hard to make insanity seem rational. John David Washington earning a future action-star persona, Pattinson earning his soon-to-come Batman persona. Elizabeth Debicki earning the film it's heart and soul and Kenneth Branagh doing all that he can to tear down that heart and soul...and Batman and the action star.Emotion wise, this may be Nolan at his most straight forward. Most character's have little backstory or emotional stakes to the game other than doomsday = bad for everyone. But there is plenty of life breathed in from the characters acting based mostly on instinct or reaction to whatever's been placed in front of them. A pretty apt way of looking at Nolan's latest as a whole to be honest.As Clemence Poesy's scientist Laura states early in the movie 'Don't try to understand it... feel it.'"
609,"It's hard to explain.. it's majestic for some but highly dud for many...
I think Nolan went too ahead of its time... and 70% of audience will find it hard to understand it's true purpose.."
610,"Let's start with the one thing I liked about the movie there is no CGI, that I noticed, alright now let's move on.
this entire movie is one info dump to another info dump, you get absolutely no time to process anything said in the film, what makes it even worse is, unlike Inception where they don't spend that much time actually explaining how Inception works and when they do it at least sounds like it makes a little sense, Tenet makes absolutely no sense it's just one nonsensical info dump after another. there's literally no story other than them trying to explain something that makes absolutely no sense.
I don't understand why there is a Damsel in Distress plot stuck in for no reason she does nothing the entire movie and is only there for the main character to save her, literally pointless. this movie breaks one of my Cardinal rules of filmmaking which is don't make your main plot about a world-ending event all it does is tear all tension out of the film especially because this is an action film, am I seriously supposed to believe that they are going to end the world or kill the main character because I know for a fact they won't, that's just how action films work, compare to any other Christopher Nolan film they don't have any world-ending events in them because they take the tension out of the film.
and don't get me wrong I'm a Christopher Nolan fan but I think that's why I'm so disappointed in this film because I know he can make good movies but he decided for whatever reason to go with a movie about cool set pieces instead of a movie that tells a good story and makes sense. and for those reasons, I would not recommend this to anyone. I would consider this the worst Christopher Nolan film yet.... I'm not mad I'm just.... disappointed."
611,My friend & I were confused throughout as to what was going on & it didn't help the dialogue wasn't clear & was mumbled in some places. Some parts seemed excessively loud & at nearly 3hrs too long.If it was shorter with more character development & less going on it might have been enjoyable.
612,"I am a french native Canadian. I watch all my movies in english for years and i could not understand the protagonist. He speak softly, doesnt articulate and he is always muffed out by either a mask, an incredibly loud ambiant sound or even both. This movie is complex and the dialog are crucial to understand it or at least to get a glimpse behind the curtain. It doesnt give you the time to absorb information, it switch scenes like SNL on steroid : Complex dialog, action scene, complex dialog, action scene. I was craving for setups, a coherent development between scenes or characters. What is worse is that everybody in the movie seem to follow this crazy plot quite well, wich make me feel like a dumb idiot who have not the brain cells to keep up with all those smart people. It is the first time I was genuinly disapointed by Nolan. I always love when i get out of the theater and say : ''I never saw that before'', I could count on both hand the number of time wich that happen : ''the matrix, dark knight, inception, memento, interstellar, vanilla sky, fight club, avenger infinity''. Many Nolan movie in this short list. I never saw a concept like Tenet before. But it was so messy, so loud, so rushed, so complex that i felt lost and didnt enjoy the show despite a promising initial setup. I get it Mr Nolan, you are smarter than me. But i feel like he is just barging at this point."
613,"Nothing interesting happens, and it happens at a very high pace. The plot is like that of an inferior James Bond movie. John David Washington, Robert Pattison, and Kenneth Branagh are good actors, but wasted on flat characters. Nolan tries to make the theme seem complicated, but it is very thin, and when we get to the 3rd ride through time, it gets rather boring."
614,"This movie is good, I dare say, even great.99% of the bad reviews for this movie clearly state that they don't understand it. If you are the type of person that rates something you don't understand, you might as well call yourself a Flat Earther!"
615,Watched this in the cinema and most of the dialogue was incomprehensible. First time I asked for my money back for a movie. Whoever was the sound editor for this needs to consider a career change.
616,"The way Mr. Nolan draws attention to time in reverse manner, is just brilliant! The flow of the movie and the thriller you experience are just unparalleled."
617,"Tenet, Christopher Nolan's latest, is a James Bond-style spy action film with a fresh sci-fi concept. From its teaser, Tenet played like a parody of Christopher Nolan clichés; the high concept with mind-bending visuals, large action set pieces, and a booming soundtrack. Admittedly, it was the first time it seemed like the cracks were showing and I distinctly felt like I've already seen the film.Christopher Nolan's brilliance is his firm grasp of what only cinema can do. He inherently understands that cinema isn't a story that is told or just seen, but something that has to be viscerally experienced. It's in that experience where he builds surprise in his stories.The most prominent example from my memory is how the Tumbler was introduced in Batman Begins. When the audience first sees the Tumbler, we are verbally told by Morgan Freeman that it is a bridging vehicle that can tow cables and make rampless jumps. That piece of information is understood and easy to picture, but has no visceral impact in that expositional moment which only acts as a setup. Later when you see the Tumbler ramming over cop cars and actively jumping through rooftops, your jaw drops.There are a lot of jaw-dropping cinematic set-pieces littered through Tenet designed with that mindset; an opening action sequence in an opera theater, a plane crashing into an airport that is done for real (move over, Face/off), a highway car chase, and more. The action sequences are technically impressive; for example, the actors and stuntmen trained to perform their fights backwards which is mind-blowing to see. Even amidst all the visual spectacle, Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography conveys a realistic immediacy as if the events are unfolding before you.Where Tenet drops the ball is in how it conveys its exposition. Inception spends its first hour teaching the audience the rules of the dream world and uses visuals and cinematic language to reinforce the audience's understanding so they can take part in the more complicated schemes and gambits that Leonardo DiCaprio's team comes up with later in the film.Tenet is much more eager to get going and spends considerably less time teaching its science fiction concept to the audience along with very little reinforcement throughout. Much of the issue is all the exposition is given in dialogue and it's a chock full of made-up sci-fi terms and spy code words that craves some cutaway visuals to help explain what's being said. Add that with a roaring soundtrack (scored by Ludwig Goränson this time) that gobbles up the entire sound spectrum and what's left is a hazy elusive experience that leaves you cold.John David Washington has the presence of an old-fashioned action movie star, just a tough silent customer you don't want to contend with. Both his onscreen presence and physicality play very well to his role as The Protagonist (it's incomprehensible why Nolan couldn't have given his character a real name as if the movie wasn't complicated enough). I think Washington will become a movie star after Tenet, maybe in some actor-led action franchise on the horizon.Robert Pattinson was good as Washington's sidekick who seems to be having fun spouting the sci-fi dialogue with a playful facetiousness which reminded me of Tom Hardy's Eames in Inception. Kenneth Branagh plays his villain like a slightly campy Shakespearean version of Gary Oldman's Russian villain from Air Force One, the epitome of 90's action villains.Elizabeth Debicki has the job of being the film's emotional anchor and tries her best to pour life into an otherwise underwritten role as someone Washington's spy has to save. Added together with the labyrinthine plot and all the math that's required figuring out whether what you're seeing is forwards or backwards, it was difficult to emotionally connect to any of these characters and care about Elizabeth Debicki and her plight.The lack of an emotional connection to the characters also means there is no theme driving the story or a bigger question for the audience to ponder about and chew on. In Memento, it was revenge. In The Prestige, it was obsession. In Inception, it was guilt. Even though the theme seems like it's about time itself, Tenet is just an action film and it just does not hook me on the same level.Watching Tenet gave me a glimpse of what old age might feel like. The complicated dialogue hindered by its pounding soundtrack was inaudible. The story became increasingly harder to follow as if the plot structure suddenly decided to play a game of hide-and-seek with my brain. By the end, I was too slow and tired to follow what was happening and just wanted to go home and go to sleep.In the past, Christopher Nolan has shown great timing on the audience's brainpower and knew when to give exposition whenever our movie RAM was running low. Remember the scene in Inception where Ellen Page asks, ""Wait, whose dream are we going into again?"" That was so perfectly timed. In my theater, people burst out laughing because it was exactly what the entire audience was thinking. So there are really no excuses. Christopher Nolan knows Tenet is too much but supposes the audience will get it eventually on a rewatch. I feel half-cheated by this.People are talking about how this movie needs to be seen more than once. I heard it being murmured countless times in the men's room in the cinema after the film ended. The marketing campaign even seems to be selling that idea.Someone tried to talk me into joining a Ponzi scheme once when I was seventeen and I did not take the bait then. If an idea is the most resilient parasite, then I am Cillian Murphy's militarized subconscious projection with an automatic weapon holding the fort and still fighting the good fight. No, I do not buy into the idea of rewatching Tenet, at least not without a pause button.After the movie upon discussion, I could recite the plot, no problem. The clue is in the film's palindromic title, which is the equivalent of spelling ""race car"" forwards and backwards. What would only be clarified on rewatch is working out pure logistical issues, figuring who was when during which flip flop moment. With no emotional anchor or narrative clarity or theme, and even though I'm enjoying the water cooler discussions with friends and colleagues, Tenet is not fun enough to revisit. By default, this automatically puts Tenet at the bottom of Christopher Nolan's filmography.""Don't try to understand it. Feel it,"" says Clémence Poésy's scientist Barbara during the film's opening inversion training sequence. Well, Barbara, I tried. I really tried to feel Tenet, but in actuality, it seems it was more important to understand it. You lied to me, Barbara."
618,"If you go into this movie expecting good action sequences and some super-spy stuff, you will like it. But if you want a movie that makes sense on any level, you will be disappointed. It skips over a lot of the details of who/why/what, and simply plunges you into action sequences that make it feel like you missed the first half of the movie. Except you didn't. And the dialouge is incredibly mumble. Just sayin..."
619,"Future me likes this movie. Future me has seen Tenet a few times and is able to enjoy the movie because he is not trying to understand what's going on the whole time. Present me isn't sure if I like it or not. This is a very ambitious film by Christopher Nolan, but I found it pretty hard to follow. It also seems to create rules that it doesn't follow later in the story. I need to watch this one again to see if Future me is right."
620,"Was confusing...
With Little action sense
And to much talking"
621,"First, the positives.It is impressively made, with all the effort to do everything without greenscreen/CGI very much there on the screen.It feels epic and, for a 150mins film did not drag.Some of the twists and turns are clever and give you an ""oh, right"" moment.All of the leads are good, although Washington's character was a little bland, with Robert Pattinson and Kenneth Branagh the standout performances.Although it is dressed up as a serious, thoughtful film, at its heart it is a tribute to the 007 movies. Multiple exotic locations, big practical effects and stunts, a plot which doesn't stand up to a great deal of critical analysis and a great villain.There are some amazing practical effects. So good in fact that it is easy to miss what you are seeing until you have a ""hang on, how are they doing that..."" moment. If there is a ""making of"" segment on the Blu-ray it might be worth buying just for that.But...Background music and effects drowning out the dialogue is a common complaint where Christopher Nolan is concerned. Where the concept of the movie is explained early on (Inception, Interstellar) this is not such as problem. With Tenat though, the plot develops over the course of the movies with several plot twists. Unfortunately some essential pieces of exposition are almost impossible to make out on a first hearing, leaving me and others watching with me with no idea why certain things were happening. At least three key scenes introducing important plot elements were incomprehensible for the most part.Perhaps because it is hard to follow in places, several potentially interesting set ups seem to go no where or remain unexplained.No spoilers here but the central theme of the plot is complicated, which helps in some ways whist watching, as you do not have time to analyse anything. However afterwards various holes in the logic and physics become clear.When ultimately the big baddies plan and the reason behind are revealed, it seems trite and weak. With a bit of thought it also makes no sense whatsoever, as achieving the ultimate aim would make no difference to the instigators of the plot..Overall, I admired the skill in making this film, its ambition and the efforts made to put everything up on screen. The problem for me was, at its heart, the central plot was not that thrilling or engaging."
622,"For the most part, I usually enjoy Nolan's films even though they have always struck me as a bit ""cold"" and distanced - you know, visually impressive but the characters and the stories often lack a bit of soul (so to speak). Well ... Tenet is definitely the worst offender by far.I didn't care for the characters, since the film spends no time fleshing them out. I think the actors did what they could but they definitely didn't have a lot to work with - I liked Pattinson, though. Honestly, his character would probably have made for a more interesting and better protagonist than the Protagonist (lol) but oh well ...
Their motivations are almost non-existing or so ridiculously thin that you just don't care - again, we don't really know these characters at all, so why should we care about their motivations, especially when we are only being informed of them instead of shown?This leads to another huge problem I had with the film: so much clumsy exposition! Even totally irrelevant things get heavy exposition. The dialogue could easily be something like: ""Have you heard about a great war in the 1910's?"" ""Ah yes, World War I. began with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914 which resulted in said war that lasted 4 years, and eventually led to the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 ."" ""Very good. As you know *thing we'll never mention again*"".
No one talks like that, Christopher Nolan!Generally, the dialogue is awful yet (unintentionally) hilarious at times.
It's funny that a director who clearly wants to appear very, very clever is incapable of writing subtle dialogue ...All in all, yeah, it's visually appealing and all that but at the end of the day, I'd much rather watch a low budget film with great characters and a strong plot, than spend 2,5 hours watching a long action sequence disguised as some sort of story.Additional SPOILERS (sorta):I can't get over how egoistical and badly written Debicki's character is. Her only motivation is her son. Even when she is told, that they can prevent the world's end she's like ""but what about my son?!?!"" - my friends and I literally laughed out loud when she said that. The entire world < Debicki's son (he's not even at stake or anything, she doesn't have to sacrifice him. It doesn't make any sense at all)Also the villain's ""If I can't have you, no one else can!"" was just ... Bad. Again; show, don't tell. Come on!"
623,"One of the worst films I've ever seen. No plot, so confusing, trying too hard to be original. Would not recommend"
624,"Besides a few spectacular scenes that are well shot, the scenario is so over-complicated that it becomes a huge non sense. It gets really long and boring about half way and you start hoping it ends very soon... only went to watch it because it was shot where I live, in Tallinn."
625,"I am huge fan of Nolan, and love everyone of his films for how daring and original they are.However...This is at its heart a basic James Bond plot, that even the writers of the James Bond wouldn't use anymore dressed up with admittedly incredible effects and time bending.The villain Sator, wants to end the world using the algorithm that allows objects' entropy to be reversed. He wants to end the world because he is dying of cancer and if he cant have the world no one can. He is also a wife beater... and rich... Character development over.I'm sorry, but Thanos has a much more credible reason for doing what he is doing. It just didn't wash with me, especially when I know Nolan films in the past have had exceptionally memorable villains. Joker, Mal, Bane.On the plus side, the effects are great and John David Washington and Robert Pattinson have good chemistry and are enjoyable to watch, but they are left carrying a plot that is thin and not (i repeat NOT) confusing."
626,"I got to watch this movie for free, and yet I feel like I got ripped off.First of all, the movie is filled with unnecessary LOUD noises and music. So loud where i had to literally plug my ears during action scenes. So loud where I can't understand what is being said even in the non action scenes. Dialogue is drowned in useless music. The movie is unwatchable without subtitles. I was so confused as to what this movie was about. At the end of the movie, I left more confused then I was going into it.Second of all, pretty bad acting all around. Especially the protagonist. I mean come on. B level acting. Try harder my guy.Third, wayyyyy too complicated for the sake of being complicated. Just uninteresting. I couldn't wait to get out of there. The movie dragged out for way too long. My ears were about to burst. Watching people shoot at other people for who knows what.Conclusion, don't waste your life on this. I have aged a good 10 years after this experience. Cheers Nolan."
627,"Nolan is a good director. After Interstellar I lost faith in his writing abilities, and this movie confirmed the sentiment. Its like he watches some theoretical physics lectures on Youtube, COMPLETEY misunderstands the concepts, and then tosses them at the audience to dazzle them so he can create the set pieces he thinks would look cool. And they do look cool, but the overall experience is just frustrating.I'll avoid spoilers, but a major problem with the time travel concept it presents is illustrated in the trailer. There is time-reversed ammunition (he calls it entropy-reversed because he has no idea what entropy means) that jumps out of bullet holes into the gun. So the bullet holes were just ""always there"", waiting to disappear? And nobody notices them? It makes no sense at all, and the whole movie is this way.Perhaps realizing that his sci-fi-ish concept is nonsensical and dumb, he adds another layer of overcomplicated spy stuff involving hijacking a plane and crashing it into an airport to steal a painting (!?), sailing on catamarans for no apparent reason, and a CIA ""test"" that involves blowing up innocent concert-goers. He's on a mission to confuse you so badly you don't even know you're confused.It has its good points. For one, its something different. Its fast, intense, and has a powerful score (so powerful you can't hear the dialogue). The special effects are impressive and made me smile. I'm probably alone thinking this, but I liked the villain- he was intimidating and scary and felt like the most real thing in the movie. So, like most Nolan films, I'm conflicted as to whether or not I would recommend it. Most movies have none of these finer points. Just don't waste time trying to make sense of it, its a big pile of ridiculousness."
628,"I'm a huge fan of Christopher Nolan and also love spy movies, so needless to say, this was one of the my most anticipated films of the year. Sadly, I was extremely disappointed and think it's probably Nolan's weakest film.The plot centers around a spy (John David Washington) traveling the globe and utilizing ""time inversion"" to stop Sator, a Russian arms dealer thug (Kenneth Branagh.) As can be expected from a Nolan film, it contains stunning cinematography all over the globe--with unique wide and aerial shots throughout, especially in the first half. The film's score can also be very enthralling, such as a tense crescendo during the film's gripping opening scene in which the protagonist must lead a SWAT team to stop a terrorist attack on an opera house. Yet despite its grand scope and scale, the film ultimately feels unsatisfying. The first major problem with ""Tenet"" is that much of the story, especially in the second half, is too convoluted to really understand. Nolan's films have always been complex (which is a good thing,) but there is a difference between complexity and sophistication while delivering a coherent and thoughtful narrative (a la ""Inception"") and this. The concept of ""time inversion"" is not explained well or even executed in especially clever ways. The characters are also extremely thin and poorly developed. The other thing that is very unfortunate is that while Nolan clearly wanted to invert (no pun intended) clichés of the spy thriller genre, he ends up relishing in such clichés. For example, the Sator character is a cliché of the typical spy movie villain: tough-talking, thick-accented Russian, hard-drinking, violent, etc.Given how much I admire Nolan as a filmmaker, this film was ultimately a major disappointment for me despite its sheer ambition. 5/10"
629,"This movie will polarize audiences depending on how much they care about the following factors:GOOD:
strong acting from everyone although Washington feels a little bland. I really loved Brennagh (terrifying!) and Pattinson (charming)Production value and design is world classCinematography is very strong although not my cup of teaPractical and visual effects are top notch. None of the effects will take you out of the movie, everything looks very realBAD:
Soundtrack & Sound-Mixing: the score is very boring and monotonous. Besides the theme song (which is played only briefly) it is just EXTREMELY loud and annoying. In addition, it is very difficult to understand the actors as they speak very fast and mumble often.Length: the movie is just too long for what it's trying to do. The concept of time inversion is interesting as an idea but not exciting to watch for 2 h 30 minPlot: without the time inversion its actually a very stereo typical bad guy wants to destroy the world plot because he is upset. the time inversion idea is a neat gimmick but doesn't work nearly as well as Nolans 'time concepts' as seen in Dunkirk, Inception or Memento.Dialogue: its often trying to hard to be smart and it takes itself too seriously.
Character development: almost non existent. We have almost no emotional connection to the protagonists of the movie besides maybe Elizabeth, but I didn't really care that much eitherI'm giving it a 6 out of 10 because it is a movie worth watching but it is has too many major flaws in terms of plot, sound, editing and character development too be considered very good."
630,So all the hype and it's not even that good what the hell is going on in today's world ??? Are people just robots they follow social media believe anything said in the media and go along with it. The fact is this is not that good people.
631,"Positive
+Special effects (visual and sound)
+Camera Work
+some of the musicNegative
-Poor casting choices (mainly John David Washington)
-bad editing
-Confusing story
-The absence of Hans Zimmer
-No Character development"
632,"First if all, plot is extremely week. The only outstanding thing about the movie is the backwards thingy concept which is a bit ridiculous. The editing and the way the story is told just complicates instead of helping the audience to understand. Also the way some scenes and characters move from one encounter to another feels like lots of pieces of the movie we're left out. In general is such a mess of a movie, not enjoyable at all, specially if you try to make sense out of it.Somewhat 10min into the movie one character says to another ""... don't try to understand...""
That's the beat advice and actually the only thing that makes sense."
633,"I genuinely thought it was my old tv but reading the reviews obviously not...what is the deal with the sound like seriously..talk about killing a film before you even have the chance to try and understand it, like constantly flirting between turning it up to hear them talk, turning down when there is action & explosions...if it was an easy to follow story then fair enough but this couldn't be more complicated, I could've been watching it inverted mode...you never know, it might've made more sense. I may have enjoyed it but I guess I'll never know until I can actually hear it!"
634,"Out of the class...
Must watch 3 time atleast.
Never thought, any movie could blow mah mind after Inseption and Interstellar... But he did it again.. hats-off really."
635,"Don't bother yourself in watching it, it is nothing, nothing is clear and nothing is intresting. you don't understand anything and that's because the writer want you to feel that he is intelligent and you're dumb but the truth is that the film is silly"
636,Pretentious stinking pile of grabage. Typical Nolan.
637,"Most of Christopher Nolan's movies are an insta-watch/insta-buy for me. Not this. Find something else to watch. The movie is poorly done. It does not attempt to explain itself to the user. Oh sure, the second time through you might be able to follow the plot, but as a reminder, this movie was scheduled to go out in theatres. The only reason it did not is because Warner Bros did not want to lose money.I'm a tolerant person, but I can't tolerate this movie. If you can watch it for free, then yeah, maybe watch it. Don't pay for it, however."
638,"After watching this movie with horrible script, I don't understand the anticipation for its release.Audio is also poor, dialogue volume is low and action sounds were too loud.It felt very amateurish, like somone starting out with their career.You don't have to watch this movie, you're not going to miss anything."
639,"And get it done for under $2M
Jebus what a mess this movie was, a more annoying ""12 Monkeys"", Actually, 12 Monkeys was good, didn't piss you off. This one, omg, the first scene is promising, that's it, then, for 45 min you are trying to understand waht's going on, what they are trying to fix exactly, and then the remainer of 1.5hours you can predict and criticize and you pray for a bee_j"
640,"Positives: 3 points for Pattinson, 2 for Debicki, 4 for Nolan's ideas. Often, you're just watching because it looks cool.Negatives:
*Minus 10 points for whoever thought Denzel Washington's frozen faced offspring could act as the lead. I'm not sure even his family would say that he has an iota of charisma.
*Horrendously amateur editing at times, jump cuts & some weirdly out of place underexposed shots. Don't even dare to watch without subtitles, not that it'd help a great deal in the grand scheme of things.
*Minus 10 points for the maniacal director who crams 8 meandering ideas in one breath, offering no pauses for reactions or comprehension. It's all one long, tedious supercut.
A fantastic example of a great idea falling absolutely flat during execution."
641,"It had to happen, Nolan's finally made a duff movie.Not because of the dodgy sound-mix, something Nolan doesn't give a damn about getting right so suck it up.Nor the Camembert laden dialogue.Nor the trippy concept of time, which isn't anywhere as interesting as it thinks it and is downright clunky in how it is used as a premise compared to how time is so elegantly and satisfyingly used in Arrival or Interstellar.The problem with Tenet is that it looks like a bunch of set piece concepts held together by a protagonist so utterly devoid of screen presence that he doesn't even warrant a name. He even calls himself the protagonist of the operation at one point which...I mean, come on, that's as laughable as Clint Eastwood saying 'I'm the man with no name"" in The Good The Bad and The Ugly. John David Washington just doesn't work in this role, there's absolutely no conviction there for the part - although he's not served well by pancake flat supposedly snappy bite-back dialogue - other than looking that damned good in a suit.The villain's plot involves the old grandfather paradox (if you go back in time to kill your grandfather how do you get born to kill your grandfather), which Nolan came across in the bargain bin of Plots R Us. Apparently, the result would be apocalyptic, which will be news to writers in the 1930s (and every decade since then) when they find out they were wrong. The villain is basically a spoilt brat billionaire who wants to throw everyone's toys out of the pram because he can't have his. Like Trump, he's the kind of crap villain you just want to slap and make stand on the bold step until he sorts himself out.You would think a big old airplane ploughing into a hypersecure building would be exciting, but it kind of trundles along before gently rolling into something that looks like it was built from tinfoil and papier-mâché before inexplicably blowing up stuff because explosions.It all looks pretty, but awfully vacant."
642,"I simply dont get it..........not the movie, thats so easy and predictable......ridiculous. i have no idea how it is this well rated.
do people just go on the internet to find what the popular opinion should be and then pretend its their own? people comparing to inception, saying this pile of garbage requires 2 or 3 viewings? do you people have the attention spans of gnats or something? this movie is childsplay, nothing intellectual about it as others have claimed.the classic ""guy fights himself but one of them is wearing a mask"" i mean come on, who didnt see that coming? are you people really so naive?????theres only 1 thing worse than when you watch a movie and everything that happens you think ""i bet thats *****"" or ""i see where this is going"" - thats right, the only thing worse than that is when you are proven right about what you thought, and thats exactly what i got herefeels like i started off with my mind blown and over the course of time its getting unblown and at the end of the movie im just like ""meh"", totally unblown"
643,"Tenet was terribly written with scenes that don't meld together and action that is unexplained. It tries to be intelligent, but it's so confusing that you are left wondering what you have wasted 2.5 hours on."
644,"None of it makes any sense and the ""wannabe something"" plot is so really, really daft, it's embarrassing. Great acting, though I wonder how they would enjoy a second of working on this pile of pretentious, awkward, clumsy, uninteresting nonsense. (And I won't even mention the technical mess... )"
645,"This movie was complete tripe. The characters were two dimensional and the plot had so many holes I couldn't concentrate. The pseudo-science that Nolan has been using on his last few films (Interstellar, Inception, Tenet) is so lacking in any logic or basis in real science, he should be ashamed. Why doesn't he call a physicist once in a while as an advisor?? Because they would laugh in his face!! Don't waste your time, this movie was a D- effort at best."
646,"Stop this man making movies now, before its too late."
647,"I've loved Christopher Nolan's movies, but this one just tries to be too smart for its audience. When you watch this, you'll be left wondering what is happening, and why it's happening. The only way you get any understanding of the movie is by watching a YouTube explanatory video, and no movie ought to be so involved as to require a YouTube video to have to explain its content to regular viewers."
648,"Hello again folks. I enjoy leaving reviews for these mind twisting movies. Here I will do my best and explain the timelines of the 4 major characters. All characters go through a RED timeline and a BLUE timeline. RED is moving forward and BLUE is moving backwards in the RED timeline. I hope that makes sense. Here we go!1) The Sator Timeline. When he's a young man he finds a box while working in Russia. The box contains gold and the BLUE technology. He's on a mission to find pieces for a doomsday devise that wipes out existence. The last piece he needs is missing. He threatens Kat's life with the Protagonist. He uses the Blue technology to recover the missing piece. He now has all the pieces for the doomsday device. He than goes back to the day on the yacht in the RED timeline. The day where Kat sees SOMEONE dive off the boat and says he disappeared.2) TheProtagonist timeline. After the opening opera scene he is tortured, passes a test, and is recruited. He learns of the BLUE technology. He gathers information to lead him down the path and finds the missing piece for Sator. After Kat gets shot he then uses BLUE technology so she can heal. She can heal in the BLUE timeline because she was shot with BLUE technology. Only way to come back to the RED timeline was through another BLUE and RED machine. Only one he has seen was at the airport. So the Protagonist must get them back to the RED timeline using the airport BLUE and RED machine. Protagonist then goes back to the day of the yacht in the RED timeline. Where they remove the doomsday device before the explosion.3) The Neil Timeline. Neil helps the Protagonist in the now RED timeline. Not Neil's RED timeline but the Protagonist's RED. They find what they need to find. After Kat gets shot he goes into the BLUE timeline and along to the airport to get her through the RED and BLUE machine. He then travels to the day of the yacht in the BLUE timeline. As he is in the cave he sees another BLUE and RED machine. Knowing that they caved in the tunnel with explosives he needs to be at multiple places at once. So he then travels again through the BLUE timeline to intercept the Protagonist's failure so the Protagonist does not fail. He gets killed in the process. Keep in mind that when he went through the BLUE twice one of his selfs had to go to the RED timeline. This is where he meets up with them at the end. This is where the Protagonist realized he's dead and it was him who saved him at the opera house in the beginning.4) The Kat timeline. When she meets the Protagonist in the movie it's in the RED timeline. She tells a story about the yacht and she see a woman dive off the boat, the woman diver is herself. Later, Kat gets held hostage by Sator in the RED timeline. Sator is in the same timeline but in BLUE. After the Protagonist saves her they are both captured. Protagonist captured in RED and Kat is captured in BLUE. After she gets shot she heals (Airport scene). She then heads to the day on the yacht in the RED timeline. She sees her past self leave the boat with her son and sees Sator leave in his helicopter. Ok this where it gets tricky... Sator comes back but it's not the RED Sator it's the BLUE Sator from the highway scene after he got all the pieces from the doomsday device. The RED Sator left and the BLUE came back in the RED timeline. She kills him. She always killed him. She said earlier at dinner with the Protagonist that she saw a woman dive off the boat and her husband had disappeared. She killed him and slid him off the boat with the lotion she put on his back.Whatever happened was always going to and did happen. Neil says that a few times. But it wasn't until the end where he says it doesn't mean you should sit around and do nothing about it. Kat always kills Sator that day, Neil always dies that day.I hope that clears up some confusions. I did my best without going into the smaller details. Please react if this was helpful or not. Thank you reading those that made it until the end."
649,"... it's that the pretentious smartness of this movie serves no purpose .The effort would have better been spent on film making, such as screenplay, camera work, editing , acting , all those things that make a movie what it is , and all of which are mediocre in this film .Don't watch it twice, because you think you've missed something the first time .
There's nothing there to discover, just the same old confusion act to create a fake intellectual depth ."
650,"First of all: you are going to see an action movie, period. The sooner you understand it, the better. An action movie that, at least, is developed upon an original idea in pure Nolan's style, but that, unfortunately, is not exempted by all the cliché following this kind of films. However, the true problems are linked with all the ""black holes"" in the screenplay: the characters does not have any development throughout the duration of the movie; the dialogues are always (and with always I mean always) boring and foregone, it is basically something you have listen at least 1000 times in different action movies, and I truly believe that it would have been better to cut most of them; moreover, the plot, apart from the (weak) original expedient used by Nolan, is hardly convincing.
The result? You're are left with zero emotions, and no link with the characters at all.
Anyway, if you are able to overcome these problems, you can enjoy a good action movie that will be able to entertain you for all of its length. Because that's it, pure entertainment, no more.
Nolan already proved himself able to do way better, even within this movie's category (did someone say ""the batman trilogy""?). And I don't even mention other movies like Memento or The Prestige: those are another level, unfortunately."
651,". . . posed by the Evil Nefarious Satanic Insidious ""Al Gore Rhythm."" This Truth is not only Inconvenient, but promises to become a deadly Human Extinction Event for all Mankind. Henry V play's Al's film counterpart satyr here, who keeps leaping once more into a Time Tunnel breach. This Event on Weird Al's Horizon involves time travel, just as in Real Life the Gore Bore pops up here, there and everywhere like a much slower FORREST GUMP. With a courageous directness, TENET documents how Red and Blue Armies should be activated by the U.N. to crush Time Bandit Gore with a ""Temporal Pincer"" maneuver. Unless Humanity acts to quell this gory threat immediately, TENET cautions, we're all doomed to oblivion through an Al Gore Rhythm marching us off the planet to a deadly drummer."
652,"Baground music made it hard to understand the dialogue. Very complex plot, not unusual for this type of movie. But I just gave up trying to hear what was been said and wish I'd left before the end"
653,And buy tickets to see this film. Nolan has done it again.
654,"This movie aspires to be ""the new Inception"" or something along those lines, but it does not succeed at all.Once I left the cinema, I did not leave with a want to rewatch this, and I usually love time-travel movies, that explore the same themes as this one. However, while Tenet has a few moments, in it's dull and boring feels-like-eternity run-time, they are simply not worth it.Where to begin? The characters. There is absolutely no character development. The relationship between the characters is.... Random at best, stupid at worst.
They randomly meet and know eachother, and the movie excuses this with ""They're from the future, and in the future they would know eachother"", in fact EVERY incoherency in this movie is excused with ""sometime in the future"".
The antagonist is apparently just evil and selfish for no reason. While this may have worked in the early movie era, this is predictable and boring. And the seemingly ""twist"" in this movie at the airport is just so blatantly predictable it hurts. And then there's the question, WHY did they have to go to the airport?
Oh right. Because that's what would make sense in the future!If you want a movie that is brainless entertainment with mediocre action, Tenet is the movie for you."
655,Get me a version of this where the dialogue is audible and it would probably be a nine out of ten.
656,"I have never seen a film that I couldn't understand. Sure, plot lines have been confusing, journey have been convoluted and movies have just been terrible, but I've always managed to find a way through. Until today.Tenet is terrible. I still don't know what happened and I've been unlucky to have sat through the entire film and lucky enough to have attempted to decipher the storyline on Wikipedia. Given the opportunity to turn back time, I wouldn't have wasted my time.Pros: set pieces and acting.Cons: inaudible dialogue, badly mixed soundtrack, unfathomable story."
657,"Plenty of money spent on this big budget film, but the action scenes were quite boring and the plot complicated. I never felt engaged in the film from the start, and it was like a film the BBC would make, with little violence, a bit like the A Team series where nobody actually gets hurt. For me, I was bored and couldn't wait for it to end."
658,"I'm not stupid, really I'm not. College grad, career in computers. I have, in the past, watched and understood all of Director Nolan's other films (albeit in the case of 'Inception' this required a second and third viewings).
But this film, this 'Tenet', nope. Oh maybe bits and pieces but overall ... very little. We've all seen the film or TV episode dealing with time travel: If one could travel back in time and kill Adolph Hitler what a boon to mankind that would be. Well, Christopher Nolan takes this time travel scenario and explodes it into dozens of pieces, questions, possibilities. There's forward travel to the future, backward into the past, then the more distant past. And of course, there's always the present, the 'now'. But in this complex set of universes I just never fully understood what was going on, this made worse by the fact that much of the important early dialogue is spoken through face-masks which served to muffle the words. And as I did not know what was happening, I did not care, and as I did not care, I should have walked out. Which I did not. And so at film's end, when a voice-over makes certain statements meant to be profound and enlightening and yes, surprising, I felt ... nothing. Not a thing. And an hour later, I still do.Which raises the question, Will I watch it again? Sure.
And if I do, will I pay the admission? Oh, no.
So hey, HBO. Hey, SHOWTIME. STARZ ....
I am waiting."
659,"The good, special effects, cinematography, and some acting but I'm tired of having to watch Christopher nolan's movies multiple times to get them because keeping up and trying to enjoy the movie is impossible!! Inception was a has to watch 3 times to completely get it and yes in the end it was great, memento was just a 2 times but I got the jist from just 1, interstellar was again a 2 watch but tenet is almost unwatchable just once there's NO WAY you can get it all in 1 viewing and that sucks!! For 1 I dont like the theater as much as I used to so going once is enough so that makes it so i have to watch tenet in the theater THEN have to rent it or buy it so i can understand what the heck it's about. Skip this movie and go see the very underrated new mutants!!! Sorry nolan but enough is enough!!"
660,"Nice movie,
High Budget,
Nice Action scenes, well choreographed.
Entertaining,
Filmed originally in IMAX Camera, as it should be.
Poor Acting,
Silly Plot,
Not Nolan's best.(Maybe because his Brother didn't write the movie, and maybe Christopher Nolan is not as good in writing as he's good in directing?)"
661,"I went to see this film, full of expectation. Firstly, after the long cinema closures it was good to be a cinema goer again. Secondly, a promised reopening with a highly built up film from the Director of Inception, was certainly going to be worth donning a mask for. Well, it wasn't. The storyline was faulty, the tooing and froing causing initial confusion, which evolved into complete boredom before the final scenes arrived. The film came across as a feeble attempt at hitting a highly complex action thriller with mish mash of crazy, unrealistic ideas. Not worth going out for."
662,"My first trip to the cinema in like 5 months was to see Christopher Noalns latest of course. Love most of his movies (Memento, the Prestige, Dunkirk) but have found others (Inception) a bit full of themselves. Unfortunately ""Tenet"" is pretty much that.For the first 2 hours I was loving the movie, and it was really the kind of one of experience you hope for. But the last half hour ruins the whole thing. Rendering it rediculus. I wish they'd just stuck to an original plan here and not twisted and turned too much towards the end.The last 30 minutes are like a different movie. Only interested in visuals while testing the audiences patience with jibberish. What a crushing disappointment, switching from genius to being dumb and seriously confusing."
663,"Where to start... Confusing from the first minute till the last with so, so many plot holes and blatant errors. Acting was terrible, so was the sound and the screen play. Agree that people like this because it makes them feel smart or because it's Nolan, but I haven't felt so frustrated after a movie for a long time. This movie just wants too hard with cheesy one liners and downright dumb, cringy dialogue. I really want to ask people what they liked about this (more in depth than just 'because it's so complex') and have them explain all those plot holes to me."
664,"Christopher Nolan arguably being one of the hottest box office magnet directors at the moment, it was clear that I and my wife couldn't wait for anything less than a 150 minutes long masterpiece. However, it turned out to be an experience that left both of us puzzled. What have these 5 stars reviews been all about?Right at the outset, it was embarrassing that the beginning scene of the film was virtually indistinguishable from all those laughable cliché-packed superhero movie bikini fitness trailers we had to put up with 10-15 minutes before the actual film started. Hey, is this the movie we came to watch so eagerly? Why do we have this strange feeling?To begin with, the main characters of the film must be deemed the absolutely most striking weakness of the film that were so undeveloped and shallow that the whole story of Tenet, if there's such a thing, lacked any suspense and dynamic, which is pretty odd considering we're talking about an action movie here. And whatever they chose to do during those so long tedious 150 minutes couldn't make any sense to anyone who's got some firsthand experience of a marriage, working life or personal responsibility. All the characters seemed to be so completely detached from the true life that their concerns about WW3 or dystopia, whatever you want to call it, made me wonder why I should care about anything these guys are talking about.The utterly uninteresting dialogue seemed to be brimmed with nonsensical theorizing and irrelevant jargon just for sale of itself. Even if some of that theorization actually could make any sense, the director still hadn't bothered to make the picture do the talking to a way greater extent. At worst, some of these dialogues stretched into many minutes long marathon discussions without any point or purpose.Likewise, the endless action scenes of the film can be deemed only unmotivated considering the there *might* have been a real attempt to take a genuine cerebral approach at things. However, the approach failed too simply due to too many striking inconsistencies and loopholes in the plot.Some splendid cinematography and nice score saved this piece of garbage a little bit at least."
665,"This movie is beautifully made. I'm a fan of C. Nolan, his craft is unparalleled. I even liked Memento (after a second watch). But this one is even more impenetrable. Maybe, if i had a few hours to think about it, it would make (some) sense. My first impression is: All the craft in the world cannot hide an ambitious but ultimately VACUOUS screenplay."
666,"I dunno, but everything Nolan touches nowadays is ridiculous... I had physical pain watching this. I usually never leave a rating on any site, but this time I had to log in.
Actors and actresses are dull. Casting is dull. Action and the plot is pathetic. Conversations? Half words all the way, meaningless, makes you mad because everything in this movie is sooo unnatural in a bad way it makes your whole body ache.
Avoid this at all costs."
667,"The last time I couldn't understand a movie was Lethal Weapon... and then this one... I could only understand 10% of this movie.Movies by the same director, I could understand it 80%, 90%, 99%: Memento, Inception, Interstellar, all no problem.This movie, Tenet... either was two person talking in an argumentative manner, ""wise line"" kind of way to talking, or it is either two person smashing each other's face, or is a bunch of people shooting at each other... I really don't know what it is about."
668,"What the actual.
We had no idea what was going on from the get go. So confusing and boring.
Waste of time so we left."
669,"Look, i'm a big Nolan fan. I consider him the best director of this time, but with Tenet I felt he went too far in both concept as the storytelling.The style is very much like The Dark Knight and especially Inception in presentation. So in that regard it wasn't very original in experience.Nolan also has a unique way of giving information and don't make you watch long dialogues that state the obvious. But in Tenet the cuts and storytelling are just so messy. I couldn't help but thinking; ""what?"" most of the time only to figure it out later, or not at all. It went too quick. It's just ruining the experience.
Actually It felt quite pretentious. Like, look at me doing all super intelligent with smart dialogues and super sharp cuts. Aside from some scenes in the beginning I found the dialogues quite boring.Another typical characteristic of Nolan is time ... Many of his movies are about playing with time and I dig it usually. But with Tenet he went to a very tricky concept that's so unbelievable it instantly felt like fantasy to me.
It's so hard to wrap your head around it together with some scenes I feel like, so ... how would that work in real life? It doesn't make sense If you would apply this in a wider scope real-world setting or what the impact would be on life itself. It only works in this situational settings of the movie ... and even then, It still doesn't hold up well.
And that's one of the things Nolan was always so good with, making It believable. But with Tenet I can't help but consider It a lot of non-sense.
Even some scenes don't hold up If you would think about the real-life situation. He skips on these parts and with focus on what's happening you're not realising it, but out of that scope, looking it from the other persons perspective ... what? No way!Aside from that, the production is top notch. How he even was able to bring this wacky concept into picture Is an achievement in itself for sure, because it's pretty insane he was able to pull it off. That's why he still gets 4 points. But enjoyable? No.
I found this one a miss. The music wasn't as great as his previous movies either. the acting was fine, and started out well, but started to get hurt by the story and almost made the characters parodies of themselves. Especially Branagh (Sator).
It's not a movie I would consider watching again. He went the direction I was already hoping towards the ending in Interstellar he wouldn't do, but then he did. And then he made It even wackier in this one.Nope. Memento, The Prestige, Batman 1 & 2 and Interstellar up until the end are his absolute highlights for me, but this Is his worst one to date in my book.
Hope he doesn't continue this path."
670,"This film is not a time-travel film. It deals with time and the different ways in which time can function. Not to get into a physics lesson, but inversion is this idea of material that has had its entropy inverted, so it's running backwards through time, relative to us..There is some element of physics. There is some element of science. It's trying a little bit. Compared to previous movies, like Interstellar, the gap is maybe bigger. It's far less grounded into physics. There are a lot of times where they use science jargon and it's just jargon with no content.
Entropy is the measure of the level of order or the level of information. There's a really fundamental law in physics telling us that entropy always increases. On average, things get more and more disorganized. That's why we grow older - our body gets slowly more and more disorganized. That's why it's much easier to destroy something than to construct something. At the physical level, if you have a box and you put some gas in it, the gas will start taking up the whole space. It will spread and get more and more disorganized. When entropy increases, it means things are becoming less and less organized.Entropy out of the way, Tenet also deals with a concept of 'inversion', which an Empire article explains as: ""Inversion is a process whereby an object (or person) has its entropy reversed, essentially flipping its chronology so that from that point on it travels backwards in time instead of forwards.""In the film, the protagonist -- named Protagonist -- is sent on a mission to stop a possible Third World War. At the beginning of the film, an Esquire article attempts to explain, ""the Protagonist meets Clémence Poésy's scientist, who informs him that at some point in the future, a technology is invented that can reverse the entropy of people and objects."" The tech has been monopolised in the future by a Russian oligarch named Andrei Sator, who has created an 'algorithm' that allows him to 'invert' his 'entropy', via 'turnstiles'Sator is dying, and taking a chapter out of the Bond villain playbook, he plans to take the entire world down with him by attempting to 'reverse the arrow of time permanently, which means that rather than simply flowing backwards, the people in the future would be able to overwrite the past.'
The film concludes with a large scale action scene that unfolds both forwards and backwards, while parallel scenes involving past and future versions of the same characters play out. To stop Sator, several events are put into motion, and a 'temporal pincer' strategy is put into effect. What is a temporal pincer, you ask? According to Empire, ""It's a time-bending tactical technique for missions: you approach it moving forward in time, and then also approach it in reverse moving backwards from the future - each side using the knowledge that the other side gained from having already experienced it. Except, both sides are actually experiencing it simultaneously.""The 'heroes' are divided into two teams -- one moving forward in time, and the other backward. ""Thus you have inverted and un-inverted Tenet soldiers fighting against Sator's men, while The Protagonist and Ives (played by a near-unrecognisable Aaron Taylor-Johnson), both on the red team, head down into the bunker to nab the Algorithm,"" Empire continued.There's also additional information about possible environmental damage and the Earth becoming uninhabitable in the future, but the film doesn't dwell on that too much.It ends with a revelation. The Protagonist has been the man in charge of Tenet all along. He has already experienced the events of the film, and stuff that happens after it ends. He recruited himself for the mission. His aide, Neil, played by Robert Pattinson, has been moving backwards in time, while the Protagonist has been moving forward.Esquire explained, ""The Protagonist inverted himself in the future, set up the whole mission, then went on to recruit Neil and arm him with the information he needed to help. He also, it would appear recruited himself, setting up the mission which he would recruit his past self into without knowing that the version of him the future is the one pulling all of the strings.""His loop closed, Neil tells The Protagonist, ""'What's happened, happened', but instead that in the future the world was always safe because they had already gone into the past to make it so."""
671,"It's just a bad movie where a lot is played backwards... The potensial was great, the execution was bad. Anyways... enjoy."
672,"Having watched the movie twice by now Tenet I'd say is not Nolan's best movie but still a very good movie. I will always be a fan of Nolan for bringing such unique movies to the table where sequel prequel remakes and even other source material adaptation (books or comics) are becoming the norm, he always brings something people have not seen or heard before. His movies are an experience at this point and this movie is no exception. The way Nolan films ""inversion"" and the action sequences which it brings along with it are some of the best you'll see. I was just wowed. The movie does require a second watch to fully appreciate not because it begs you to but because you will wanna watch it again you will want to experience and understand Nolan's vision for it. I enjoyed myself watching the movie the second time."
673,Looked forward to watching and went in with an open mind but a complete mess of a film. Trying to be too clever made it far too confusing. I often wonder do these people ever watch the film back as the background music was so loud you struggle to hear what the actors are saying. Switched off after 90 mins as by then i couldn't actually care what was happening.
674,"Yeah people will say I am not smart enough to understand this movie but ask yourself first did you understand it at first??
It was way to confusing I was literally scratching my head and aksing myself and my friends what the hell was happening in the movie ?
Acting was good visuals are good too but movie if I would have understand it I might give it better score"
675,I've seen other reviews about a clever intellectual film but I found this a boring mess of a film
676,"Anyone looking forward to this movie may be dissatisfied watching this potpourri, perhaps the worst big ticked film for 2020. The first hour and a half is not entertaining, confusing and boring to watch. Antagonists battling opposing forces trying to save the world repeatedly.The last hour is saved from the film being a total flop, when the movie finds its feet to become mildly interesting and reach a satisfactory conclusion.Viewers adverse to sci-fi nonsense should stay away to have a pleasant day."
677,"The story is complex as it is without adding unintelligible dialogue and loud music to the mix - the recipe for a real migraine and eyestrain after 2+ hours of watching this movie. I'm a sci-fi fan and very much into time travel. I loved Interstellar, Inception, Memento, but this latest Nolan flick is a huge disappointment. It really needs multiple watches to fully comprehend what the f the movie is about, maybe never understand it at all. You need a Physics degree or something to wrap your brain around this, and that in itself tells you this is not a good movie to watch if you're looking to be entertained. Now if you like puzzles, then go ahead. Unlike other brain-twisting Nolan films, this movie just doesn't cut it. Technical aspects of it (except for the sound mix) are brilliant and worth whatever it cost. But that's about it."
678,"This is a feature-length version of Michel Gondry's video for Cibo Matto's song Sugar Water. Find it on the youtubez.If you don't get the plot of this movie, just watch the aforementioned video and replace love with Plutonium. Add big-budget Hollywood vfx and a lot of egomaniacal fussing about how rich dudes have to die in a cruel world just like everyone else and there you have it.Gondry didn't need a special room to make his point because when the gimmick is presented with split-screen in 4 minutes you can just see the crossover for what-it-is and enjoy the symmetry.This movie is way more portentous and maybe even a bold comment about how high-zoot oligarchs are putting everyone's nuts in a vice with uber tech and fake news... Ok, props Nolando!The action really serves no point in this movie because is a movie, backwards is still forwards, so the cleverness rests in something you are told, not shown. These leads to paradox of an action movie that only makes sense when it is explained by its characters. Helpful to watch with subtitles due to bad sound and JDW slurring his speech.This movie is very dramatically lopsided, like Dunkirk, due to AWOL Jon Nolan, who is the smarter brother, and Chris' reliance on set pieces which at best are absurd.In spite of these criticisms, I enjoyed being beaten over the head by this production more than I expected I would.This is not anywhere close a masterpiece. Masturbxxxn, maybe.I suggest watch Prestige again, because it has something analogous a beating creative heart, unlike this didactic amusement park ride for Nolan-bots."
679,"The bad:
This story is completely silly and a complete mess. And it's too long. (2 and a half hours!) Let's face it, how long can a director capture an audience with a gimmick of walking backwards through life? We did it as a kid, walking backwards. It was fun then. But making an entire movie about it and thinking you are smart? Who were they kiddin'?More bad: let's not even talk about the ridiculous editing pace of this movie. A simple conversation between 2 persons is being cut as if it were an action sequence. The actors AND the acting aren't very impressive either: lots of silly accents (Robert Pattison with his ""English"" accent) and lots of B-actors without real charisma.The good:
This movie is really intrigueing at the start. And quite exciting as well. There is lots of frenzy like action from the get go. Although I didnt understand anything that went on, from the very beginning, it all looked quite cool and fascinating. Not understanding can be interesting...More good: the movie looks beautiful. The design is impressive. Some of the camerawork is pretty classy. There is also a frenzy like feel throughout this movie, which I liked.But in the end this movie is a gimmick that failed. It's a wannabe smart movie,that upon closer inspection is rather silly..."
680,"The biggest problem with Tenet is the lack of logical motivation for what the characters do.
For a filmmaker like Nolan who tries to give a logical explanation about everything that is happening during his films, this is a big problem.
And he has tried to hide this lack of logical motivations by making the film so big and full of distractions which are absolutely unnecessary.
For a filmmaker who made a low budget film as good as memento this is a major step down and a very good example of spending money on the wrong things."
681,"Christopher Nolan's latest movie 'Tenet', with a series of heists and a get-the-girl-subplot as its pillars is organized like an intertemporal James-Bond-thriller. It has a clever idea at its core, contains a decent amount of fizzy dialogue, and is often visually stunning, thus basically watchable.Since its core idea - colliding objects and, last but not least, humans, moving in opposite directions through time - is radically counterintuitive, to put it mildly, I found myself frequently highly skeptical that I even know what's happening on the screen on the most basic physical level, never quite sure whether I'm played for a fool by pseudoscientists or mocked because of my profane inability to engage fully in a genius physicist's thought experiment. Some of the principles of reversed-time-causality presented to the viewer seemed intuitive, many less so. Thus, I felt like being confronted with a 2,5h time-mechanical conundrum that, after the time had passed in my unreversed environment, left me with a slight headache."
682,Easily the worst movie I have seen this year. I'll never get that time back. I should have listen to the early reviews when it first came out.
683,"Some of Christopher Nolan's films are included on my all time favorite list. I typically love what the guy has to offer, and before when people complained about the confusing plot in his movies like Inception or Interstellar, I never understood what they meant because to me those two movies are nearly perfect.
So, I am shocked at how much I didn't enjoy this film based on my expectations going in. NOTHING happens for a big chunk of time and then we just go back to those scenes again after a while. Nolan is also still incredibly bad at writing female characters as anything but a punching bag or a damsel in distress.
John David Washington is great in this, I hope to see more from him but his characters is just so bland. Everyone else does a fine job acting as well but no actor could have saved this boring and confusing script.
When most of the audience doesn't understand your movie, it's not the audience's fault when the plot is also this boring and self-indulgent to begin with. I could not have cared less about what happens at the end if I tried. Just pure meaningless explosions going back and forth.
Not watching this again but Nolan gets a pass I suppose for me, since this is the first movie I have not liked from him. It's shot well, the score is decent, the acting is fine but everything else is a miss."
684,"If you want to spend almost three hours of time for nothing then"" tenet"" is the way to do it."
685,"I think I'm coming around to the realization that I can't really claim to be a fan of Christopher Nolan anymore.Three of his earlier films, Memento, The Dark Knight and The Prestige, are all masterpieces in my eyes, but ever since Inception, Nolan's films have tended towards the overlong, overblown, overcomplicated and incomprehensible. Tenet is no different: it's got a great idea to do with time travel, but it does nothing with it that hasn't been done much better before. There are moments and ideas in this film that are strongly reminiscent of earlier films such as Looper, 12 Monkeys, Back To The Future and Timecrimes, but completely stripped of the story and characters that made those films mean something. You don't and can't care about any of the characters in this film, so all you're left with is a good ""what if"" and a bunch of loud and explosive set-pieces that don't make any sense at all when you start to think about them.John David Washington is solid in the lead role, as a kind of unaffiliated black American James Bond - another series of films Tenet is strongly indebted to - but here again, stripped of the worldbuilding necessary to make it (kind of) believable, what we see is a guy we don't know anything about, starting off alone but uninhibitedly traveling the globe with seemingly limitless resources. You can kind of believe that MI6 have operatives everywhere around the world and money to burn in helping out James Bond. But here none of that is explained so it just seems like a lazy schoolboy fantasy of consequence-free impossible adventures.Although I do appreciate the scale of Nolan's vision, there has to be a meaningful story at the center of it all for it to be worth it, and I wish his next film would be a much more back-to-basics tale, with an ingenious premise but with the people at the center of it being the point of it all, rather than just cogs in a shiny, clanking, whirring but empty machine."
686,"I'm pretry sure those who say it's great and you have to watch it multiple times, still cant explain the nonsense this movie is. Its hard to follow and you cant hear the dialogue at all. Good luck ifnyoubstill decide to watch this hotnpule of garbage."
687,Some of the sequences where turnstile is explained or works should have been slow to let the audience comprehend what is going on. And multiple sequences of people going forward or backward in time and unable to understand it makes you uninterested. U will feel like u should just smash ur electronic gadget ion which u r watching the movie. I feel that it is a Nolan's way of saying I am more intelligent than everybody.
688,"Needed to lip read or apply sub titles for this film. Trying to understand the mumbling of the actors was frustrating but trying to understand the storyline was just too confusing.
Almost as disappointed in this movie as I was with True Detective 3 which again was ruined by the mumbling diction of the lead actor."
689,"Tenet is a good movie, but I expected something like Inception, where we have an amazing plot and a great story wich is accompanied by the deepth of the characters. Tenet doesn't contain the above, it feels like an action movie with physical concepts and a James Bond movie, all in 2h and 30 minutes."
690,This movie was so hard to watch. In fact we walked out before it ended after determining that we had no idea what was going on. The audio was awfully the plot was....impossible to grasp. Don't waste your money on this one
691,"Christopher Nolan's latest film confuses depth with complexity. He wants so badly for it to be profound, but it is actually a ludicrous mess. The film is basically ""Inception"", minus characters we care about, and exchanging layered consciousness for time reversal. There are times during the film's final third that are more confusing than listening to someone explaining string theory in ancient Sanskrit... backwards! At some point, I just stopped caring entirely. I am sure there is a Nolan fanboy out there who will spend the next couple of months trying to explain away all the plot-holes with well articulated points. Please let me not meet that guy!"
692,"This movie has easily one of the most complex stories I have seen. If you don't fully understand the story you can look at it and see ""it's only mindless action"" but you need to watch it a second time or give it some thinking over. You should eventually understand it and when you do your mind clicks and you suddenly realise how genius it was. Don't rate poorly because you don't instantly understand it, but think about, watch it again and then try to see the bigger picture."
693,"Worst cinema experience I have had. We left the cinema because the soundmix was too loud. Our ears were demolished.
The staff reassured us that the volume was how Nolan intended it. As a huge Nolan fan this really puts a stain on his reputation."
694,"Not worth it. It's like blacklivesmatter met feminism in a world of incompetence. The movie has so many flaws it's embarrassing... They had the nerv of comparing a ""scientist"" (woman) to Oppenheimer. Forcefully feminist! The main character, week, played by an actor that doesn't have the style to be at the same time smart and physically superior. It's a joke. The special effects are the only thing that will make you keep watching this thing."
695,"One day Nolan woke up and thought....what if I can have some awesome CGI scenes where I can show things moving backwards? Thats it. He just thought of it and made this horrendous ""Science Fiction"" movie. Start to end..There's no proper plot to it. This movie is devoid of logic. But Still, There will be some Nolan fanboys that will claim that ""You didn't understand his vision; its upto viewers to decode and understand movie"" . I ASK WHY?? WHY audience should tie up the loose ends of film. Isnt that filmmakers job? Tomorrow, I'll make a movie with random scenes and call it a masterpiece saying its audience job to find the ""secret"" plot. Lol. This movie has like 50 plot points that goes way over the head of literally anyone. Then, there's pathetic background score. My head hurt half the time becuase of that OST. Please someone tell me the Tenet technology. I want my time and money back."
696,"Time inversion was silly. Red Dwarf did it better many years ago. However watching this film , one thing was clear: Robert Pattinson will play James Bond one day and he will be awesome. I didn't even like Robert Pattinson before this. But yeah Robert Pattinson good, film was garbage."
697,"I love Nolan latest works, but this film was strange, it was technically perfect, but it lacked of something else...
It's outstanding how they show us physic aspects that are scary and awesome at the same time, it was ABSOLUTELY complex, and I guess it was even more complex to write and direct, please, an Oscar for every person who put this piece of quantum work together, but, Nolan focused so much in complex aspects that he practically forgot of the humanity level, what we people follow him, or maybe it was a short film and they didn't have time to do it properly, I dont know, but I feel like there was no character development at all, the characters looked barely alive, the main actor, GOD, who is that guy? is he an actual actor?? I don't even know him, he acted like me, and that's not a compliment, Robert Pattinson should have been the main character, even his character was also bad constructed and souless, he got acting skills, I think that mistake was a HUGE thing, by the other hand, there are no hard stories, the kid and the mother were barely developed, I couldn't feel empathy for them, it was like a hard to watch film that had nothing else that a complex physic plot, which, I actually loved, I love sci fi, I studied physics, I love that theme, but, that's not enough for a film like this and with a great director like this, this is the first Nolan's film that I doubt I will watch more than once :/ the 3 points are only because of the EXTREMELY HARD WORK AND BRAIN BURNING the production suffered to make this film, but I would give it a 0 for the story."
698,"Bad acting from lead actor,he is not for this roll. Movie is too slow."
699,This movie is way to complicated and hardly enjoyable. Not my cup of tea
700,"I love most of Nolan movies, but sometimes he does some awful choices. This movie is obviously one of these, as he did not found the way to accomplish the vision he had. I felt the same ""memento"" s*** all over again, We sure need more ""Interstellar"" way of storytelling over this one."
701,"When you strip away all the fake complexity this movie is artificially inflated with in order to make it seem intelligent, its story is completely stupid, meaningless and uninteresting.
The main protagonist is the ugliest creature I have ever seen and he clearly wasn't picked for his acting skills. The dialogues are wooden, lifeless and uninspired. The action scenes are all contrived and dumb. The characters are boring and one-dimensional and half of them are diversity hires that aren't believable in their roles in the slightest.This movie is trash with a glossy finish."
702,"Wait what did I watch??? It was rubbish, too much background noise, couldn't understand it half the time and acting not great at all. You need to reverse it and make it again."
703,"Everything about this movie made no sense! The execution was very bad. The reverse scenes made no sense and the jumps were abrupt and disjointed. Am angry, so much noise made about this movie only to be let down so hard. Am not watching this twice, forget it."
704,"Christopher Nolan was due for a dud, and if I can save some 2.53 hours of their life, here is my chance.Outside of the first act, a tightly wound cinematography dream...it's all downhill from there. Its not even that it's pretentious (which it is), or bad acting (which is had) or a storyline that you dug your heels in and waited for the payoff (which never arrives), its just a bloated waste of time with the sploudies and a script unraveling in real time (not the future), or maybe it was...I don't even care, the credits couldn't roll fast enough.Hard pass."
705,"I really tried to make it but the movie gets even worse in first 30 minutes. Dialogues are hollow, characters are not convincing. Hollowness of characters and dialogues are even more unrealistic than bullets coming from future."
706,"Very poor acting, terrible dialogue and building of characters, the leading actor- useless... what a disappointment!!! Nobody is giving me back my two wasted hours!"
707,"Half way through the movie and I had enough. Noland didn't bother to make the movie intelligent, mesmerizing, not even a little puzzling.. Instead it is just a bad (and unexplained) excuse to make a movie where half of it is played backwards. The acting is B level at best, the storyline a C and the writing is almost as terrible as the audio quality. Too bad."
708,"Idea was repeated
music was bad
and i expect more to Nolan and his film"
709,"I watch a film to pass the time and be entertained. Entertained I was not. It felt like I was having a mild stroke trying to keep up with this film. The pacing was insanely fast. One minute they are in the Ukraine, the next they are in the Sea, then in England, then who knows where? It's a very pretentious film that gives off the vibe to watch it more than one time. No thank you, one time was enough."
710,"The concepts are really difficult to grasp and storyline not interesting at all. You can't really understand it after watching once. Watch it once with subs while noting down all the technical terms, do your several-hour long research, discuss it with someone else to verify that you got it right, then watch it again to fully understand it. That's like a bad homework. I mean interstellar was also a bit complex but it had a terrific storyline. This one's bland. Extremely disappointed."
711,"It's just a mess of a film. At no point are you given the opportunity to want to care about any of the characters, so their journey in and around themselves is pointless. And a bit tedious."
712,This was absolute garbage. Accents you cant understand with jargon no one has ever heard of. Fast pacing. I had to watch with subs and still had to pause to understand what each person was saying. Whats the story? Just a bunch of action sequences in reverse playback.
713,"For one reason: it makes no sense. You will be sitting there wondering: ""Huh?"" ""What?"" ""Why?"" ""What just happened?"" And even if you spend the whole day trying to sort out the plot, it won't make any sense. The writer/director/auteur Christopher Nolan's singular style is Go Big Or Go Home. He takes a big budget, a big cast of characters (note I said 'characters' not 'stars') and then he tries, actually tries, to make the story as convoluted as possible. Just so he can justify the huge budget, special effects, fancy camera work and arguably big cast. It's good this movie played in theatres during the Great Pandemic; less people will have paid (wasted) good money to see it and now they can see it for free via streaming. There are so many movies that tell a reasonably good story and are easy to understand. Yet those movies don't get much credit. Too bad.This movie lets you travel the globe and visit some exotic locales (Mumbai, right? where some fabulously wealthy arms dealer has his fortress apartment right across the street from a ghetto market) such as the Ukraine where the opera house is designed like a football stadium. I guess in the Ukraine, there are as many opera-lovers as America has football fans.Nolan needs to get his head out of his video game and go see the real world. Please don't give this man another penny if he's going to film his own script. And don't waste your time trying to sort out the bits and pieces that make up this movie. Because any logic you can make of it, will still be full of holes."
714,"SOunded promising, the actors are great, the action scenes awesome and the budget was huge; and we love sci-fi and interesting films. Problems, the actors are hard to hear, the plot is not worth going back to the cinema twice (read other reviews) and overall it felt like a waste of time and completely unsatisfying. Best advice - wait for it to stream, watch in subtitles and find a place that explains the plot."
715,"Somebody needs to stage an intervention. No more pop-sci books for you, Christopher!"
716,"""Tenet"" is not quite as stupid as ""Inception"" or ""Interstellar"", the stupidest movie of all time, though it is fairly stupid, but doesn't ram its own stupidity in your face quite as much as those earlier titles. (SPOILERS) The movie's basic tenet (ha-ha) is that it's possible to encounter objects moving backwards in time, or with negative entropy. But this idea becomes quite complex and it's not clear that even Nolan who wrote and directed, is keeping track of it properly.Variations on the reversed time theme are added throughout the film, but some of them might need a bit more thought. It's not clear to me that two men can have a fight when one is punching and the other is un-punching. Or why a reversed time bullet is said to do more damage than a normal one. Or that encountering a reversed time car is the same as driving a normal time car backwards.All would be clearer if not for Nolan's current interest in men with beards. The charisma-free lead mumbles into his beard most of the time. In case he doesn't have sufficient impact, there's a second almost identical looking character with a second mumbly beard. Funnily enough these don't look like real beards, but like the fuzzy foam type stuck onto an Action Man (or GI Joe) figure. Ken Branagh, doing the Russian accent which seems to be his speciality (why?) also has a beard to mumble into. The female lead doesn't have a beard, but manages to mumble into something - the soundtrack often obscures the dialogue anyway.Also Nolan seems to be working his way through a book called ""great movie cliches"". There's loads of stuff in the movie that you've seen before - having a choice of army patches and sticking one on your shoulder only after you see which army squad arrives (pinched from ""Money Heist"", I think), pulling a man's gun apart while he holds it, walking too close to the baddie so he can snatch your gun out of your hand, saying ""See you on the other side"" (from Da Vinci's Demons"", ""Dark"" etc etc etc).But Nolan thinks he has been particularly clever in hiding an acrostic in the names of the baddie, his company, and various passwords. OK, it's ""SATOR AREPO TENET OPERA ROTAS"", thank you very much. Arrange it in a square, it read the same backwards and forward, up and down. It also contains the term ""PATER NOSTER"". Why? No-one knows, or cares.The soppy aim for a child-friendly rating (pointless - no child will enjoy this film) means that blows are struck but never seen landing. As in ""Inception"", the action scenes are actually good if you don't think too much about what's happening. But by the time you reach them towards the end of the movie, you've lost interest. The central character inhabits a charisma-free zone, the eventual introduction of the time reversing machine is hidden away, the actual threat to humanity posed by mumbly Ken Branagh is pretty unclear.The movie's too long, and there's a lot of wordy sections. But switch off your brain and it's OK, and not a load of fles tnegludni parc at all."
717,"I read some of the other reviews. I was fully expecting most of them to be gushing ""Nolanites"" brownnosing the director. Was surprised to see even the fanboys were disappointed with this mess.Like the other reviews have said, this movie is much too dense and difficult to follow. It is so layered as to be pretentious. I felt like I sat down to watch it halfway through - for the entire movie.One would argue it's so deep as to need multiple viewings. For me, it's so deep as to be suffocating. Within the first ten minutes, I was asking myself what the heck was going on and never really got an answer to my questions. I understood they needed to stop the Russian meanie and he was using time-based elements to do bad things, but most of the events surrounding it I did not comprehend.The characters weren't interesting at all - vapid, 2-dimensional, taking themselves too seriously. I really didn't care what happened to any of them except for the Russian dude - naturally I wanted him to get his comeuppance for being such a despicable human being.But Nolan could do with a little bit more light-heartedness in his films, as in, humor. Let us breathe for a few minutes - it balances the film out. Take a break from the ""thought-provoking"" stuff and balance it out with a quip or joke now and then. Or at least give the audience some time to think about the complex ideas set forth. Quit firehosing the audience with philosophical/expositionary layer cake, please.There is thought-provoking and then there is thought-is-choking. Tenet falls squarely into the latter category.Won't be watching it multiple times to figure out what happened. It was too deep and I felt like I was drowning."
718,"Two stars.
One for each hour of my life I won't get back.The CGI in places is awful; overlooking the harbour, you can see her neck hair has been cut off to put the background in.
The catamaran racing scene is also awful.Just an absolute waste of time.
Don't bother."
719,"Hoo boy. Not sure how to review the latest Nolan brain-twister. Maybe in reverse?The opening was thrilling - major vibes from the opening scene of ""The Dark Knight."" But it went sideways (or multiple-ways) from there.I went in knowing this was mind-bending. That it would take multiple viewings to make sense of it. But it was beyond confusing. It was unintelligible.At some point, I was so confused (watching things/people go backward through time while things/people go forward in time will do that to you), I pulled up a scene-by-scene recap on my phone. And even that didn't help.Great acting: Check.Awesome cinematography: Check.Pounding soundtrack: Check.Do you ever watch a 2.5 hour James Bond movie and wonder ""Where in the world are they now? Which massive death-defying air/sea/land chase are we watching now?""That's essentially what this is ... A confusing epic Bond movie with a ""reverse-time"" brain teaser thrown in.Expect to read/watch a recap (or two) afterwards to try and make sense of it (trust me - it doesn't help)."
720,"Exercising cerebrum capacity to its maximum extent I'm unsure if this was a pleasure or a pain - not the unravelling of the puzzle but whether it was actually worth the effort in the first place. Either way, it was great to get back into a cinema after such a fallow time and, while the audio could have done with subtitles at times, the visuals were stunning."
721,"This movie is annoying. It has a very simple plot, premise and sequence of events and yet it psychotically scrambles every story beat with a thick of fog
of ""COOL!"" and ""SMART!"". And yes it does so, shoutingly.
Courtesy of the sound mixing. Yet it does these things while forgetting about any action films single most important rule: Motivation.
I couldn't understand why anyone did anything because I was never told the reason. Even when it came to the stakes of the story I was not told what it is I need to fear or why.
And I want to be clear on this.
I was actually told ALL of these things, but I wasn't shown.
A good 70% of this film feels like Chris Nolan is reading his script to us like we are his teachers, who'll fail him if he doesn't try hard enough.
But an action film, which this is, that is as convoluted and confusing as this is, rarely delivers an impact.
I like the premise more than the execution.
This should have been simple.
There was no reason to make Tenet that long or dreadfully pseudo intellectual.
I felt pretty mistreated, by this director whom I've come to appreciate as an effective artist.
Anyways, after watching it a second time, I realized it wasn't me that didn't get it, but there is just an overabundance of plot-holes.
So don't pat yourself on the back if you ""got it"", because you can't.
It's a dumb action-time-travel-movie pretending to be so much more.
I hope the next one doesn't suck, Chris!"
722,"No, thanks!
This movie pretends to be an iconic but is just a mess.
Or maybe is a mix between Back to the future, Deja Vu, The Matrix 2, Inception.
I didn't see a clear vision from the director, just a mess. The movie is full of clichés - bad Russian, smart Indian, english lord, cool American with ""funny"" jokes.....
Excellent Robert Pattinson and Kenneth Branagh."
723,Confusing!! Hard to follow. Lead actor has no charisma. Wanted to walk out but hung in there.
724,"Sometimes great movies are confusing. But that definitely doesn't mean that confusing movies are great. One can't help but wonder throughout the lengthy film if the lack of explanation is a means to hide a lack of depth, and even a lack of almost any story at all.SPOILER WARNING: The movie is basically this, a man discovers that certain nuclear reactions cause objects to reverse in time. Then we get introduced to people who happened to be the ones who encountered the radioactive material, and they've been receiving gold shipments from themselves in the future. We never learn anything more. We know that the main character decides to use the nuclear material to go backwards in time, and continues to go back further at the end of the movie. And Robert Pattinson tells us that they met a long time ago in the past, and they got into some stuff, and they're best friends, but we don't actually get to see any of that, we're just told it happened.The entire movie is just basically watching this incredibly simple plot unfold. They hide the plot behind having to break in here, an army fights there, there's an art dealer who knows more here, and so on, but it doesn't actually add to the plot."
725,"It would be easy to say that this film is great but is not. It is Nolan's worst film, so boring! There is no need to watch this movie in the cinema.
If you understand the movie it doesn't mean the movie is good..."
726,"Full of cheesy cliches (Russian arms dealer who made a living selling nuclear bombs in a post soviet state, cookie cutter gruff SAS guy 'standard operating procedure', Michael Caine cameos, 'it's not fate...it's reality' lines galore). When the movie isn't entertaining itself with ludicrous dialogue ('if the world ends...that means my son would die'...) it's bamboozling the audience with ridiculous explanations of its own self-important 'physics' ('entropy', 'algorithms', 'inverted everything').Most of the critical dialogue to explain the movie is explained only once; and meanwhile there is often a car crash/explosion going off in the background, a dystopian ear-splitting soundtrack, or a Russian voice being played backwards which makes it hard to even understand what's being said. The only part of the movie I clearly understood was the part where they explained the tax efficient benefits of a Freeport for transiting artwork across borders. They explained that like 3 times. I wish they could have explained why an 'algorithm' can change 'entropy' as many times.I'm normally a fan of Nolan movies, but he lost me when he introduced the 'temporal pincer movement'. Many will watch this movie 3 times and understand everything and I'm happy for them. For the casual viewer, it's fun to see some explosions but the plot is largely incomprehensible."
727,"Mario's rating: 6/10 (free ports)
An agent tries stopping time from running in reverse, because of a future running from a ruined tomorrow.Thumbs up:
The score by Ludwig Göransson and Travis Scott is excellent, production values are top notch, and the stunts are sensational + believable. Kenneth Branagh's the best actor on screen - fearsome, fatal, focused and free.Thumbs down:
Character motives and choices, along with certain plot points, aren't always the most original or convincing. The dialogue at times becomes overwhelming exposition. Fight scenes aren't always well-defined. And there's not much of an emotional hook for the protagonist, and ultimately, the audience.Favourite scene:

728,"I fully appreciate Chris Nolan's talent - specifically how he builds films around intriguing concepts using a uniquely muscular visual and audio style. But while I love so much about what he does, I find a lot of his recurring habits when it comes to pacing, editing and exposition deeply annoying - and that they detract from his obviously massive talents in other areas. Maybe I'm not on his natural wavelength of pacing, but on first viewings I usually find his films too rushed and choppy to properly connect with - though I almost always find I come to appreciate them a lot more with subsequent viewings. This was especially true of Interstellar (left me underwhelmed on first viewing, but have since come to like a lot) and to a lesser extent Inception (really disliked on fist viewing but came to appreciate). And given what I'd read about the advised ""multiple viewings"" for Tenet I went in aware this might be the first step of a long journey to appreciation - rather than a shot of instant gratification.I also went in arrogantly assuming that I'd be able to follow a plot many have claimed lost them; I've got a background in science and philosophy and have spent years writing about time travel and other possible worlds - so how hard could it be?I even went armed with a pair of earplugs to deploy should the sub bass of the score and sound effects start to overwhelm the dialogue on the already notorious soundtrack mix.And so, equipped with all this foreknowledge - as if preparing for a mission or exam - I went excitedly into my local IMAX for the first time this year.Sadly, I was still ill-prepared.The first hour or so flew by nicely. Despite the reports I'd heard about the soundtrack, I could hear pretty much everything that was being said fairly clearly, and I was managing to keep my head above water on Nolan's typical choppy editing. I quite enjoyed the pacing actually, and liked the way the sci-fi concept was kept bubbling under in the background for the first hour.But then the wheels started to fall off.I think it really began around the (beautifully shot) catamaran sailing scene, in which Kenneth Branagh's character starts relaying key plot points over a microphone and earpiece - over the sound of the sea and flapping sails. You literally cannot hear a damn word.From then on, I was playing catch-up. And sadly, things would only get worse. From this point it seems, every line of dialogue is barked through either a mask, mic, or walkie-talkie. Pretty soon the whole thing sounds like a Bane convention broadcast on shortwave radio.But just go with it, I told myself. ""Don't try to understand it. Feel it!"" Sure, you can't hear everything, but you can pick up enough to get the gist, right?Well, kind of.The problem is that pretty soon the gist itself seems to make no sense - even on its own terms. Well-worn musings on time travel get barked by characters (who weirdly seem to lurch between knowing everything and nothing about such concepts) - bearing no resemblance to the questions you actually want answering about what's unfolding on or off screen.Scenes and shots start to crash into being without warning or context, and pretty soon the whole thing starts to feel like someone got you drunk and is making you watch a foreign film without subtitles. Backwards.Though the weird thing is I never actually switched off. And I have to say the 2h45m flew by. I guess this is some testament to the technical aspects of the film (which stays looking pretty gorgeous throughout, with Ludwig Göransson's score always interesting) - as well as my faith that Nolan would somehow find a way to make it all come together and pay off in the end (though I can't say I really found any intellectual or emotional closure in the ending).I suppose I should say a bit about the performances - but the general incoherence of the film (not to mention some truly wretched dialogue) kind of overshadows all of them. The only thing I'd seen JDW in before was BlacKkKlansman, and I was a bit underwhelmed by his performance in that. Sadly he felt very similar here. He just always feels a bit passive and vacant - which is weird since his father has such a commanding cinematic presence. Branagh managed to be fairly menacing - but mumbled his way horrendously through this film - which is ironic given he used to be a standard bearer for Shakespearean theatre. Pattinson was okay, though is cut-glass accent was a little shaky; and Debicki was good - though it was a little too familiar seeing her basically redo the role she played in The Night Manager.The horrible irony is this is the film that was supposed to save cinema - when it could very well be the film that ends up being blamed for destroying it. After six months away, what kind of joe-public audience-member is going to come out of this thinking anything other than ""I should have just watched this at home with subtitles""?When I got home, I naturally looked up a bit online to try and find some explanations of the plot made by those with minds (and ears) superior to mine. Frankly I was disappointed, and it seems maybe I didn't miss all that much in the cinema after all. Either that or the online analysts simply failed to understand the same things I did. It seems the time-travel story here isn't actually that complex - it's just the incoherently telling of it that makes it seem that way.Either way, the problems with this film clearly go far beyond unintelligible dialogue. Nolan seems to have neglected the art for telling a story in a coherent fashion - and perhaps even for a coherent story. One of the key problems for me was that most of the interesting stuff about the story seemed to be happening off-camera - away from what we're actually following (or not following, as the case may be). Characters spend a lot of time talking about the (frankly nonsensical) threat from the future, and the brilliant plans devised to prevent it - but what we seem to get served is unintelligible scraps of a small part of this plan.Given how my opinions of some other Nolan films have changed, I would certainly like to see Tenet again - but heading back to the IMAX for a second viewing seems utterly pointless, since I can't imagine ever being able to decipher the dialogue I couldn't hear the first time without the aid of subtitles. Sadly, although I may well be wrong, my suspicion is that this film isn't going to get much better with subsequent viewings.I look forward to seeing what my future self makes of Tenet in ten years' time after seeing it a few more times, but for now I can't really give it anything more than a 5/10.Mainstream cinema should never be this unintelligible."
729,"Tenet seems to take all the traits of the director and amplify them. The opening is even more frenetic than the excellent Joker heist scene at the beginning of The Dark Night, but it's less satisfying. The soundtrack out-Zimmers Zimmer with its racing, blaring, feverish relentlessness. Tenet's sound editing makes Bane from The Dark Knight Rises come across as an elocution teacher. I've skimmed literally hundreds of comments from viewers saying they couldn't catch the dialogue. Time-bending movies are notoriously difficult to weave together consistently, and this is no exception, though Nolan has worked really hard at it. So if you're going to make the plot super complex, why on earth would you make the dialogue unintelligible? That's just adding another completely unnecessary level of confusion for the audience.Then we come to the characters. Although there is some attempt to flesh out relationships between the Protagonist and the three other leads (Neil, Sator and Kat), there is an increasingly sterile quality to Nolan's work. I really cared about Leonard in Memento, was deeply concerned for Robert Angier in the Prestige and was rooting for Bruce Wayne for at least the first two Batman movies. Dom Cobb in Inception was supposedly relatable (a guy grieving his wife) but Nolan had already started to move into subordinating his more two-dimensional characters to his labyrinthine plots. The same thing applied with Cooper in Interstellar, though I did find the bookcase scene pretty poignant. It seems the more complex the plot, the more simplistic the characters. The fact that Nolan didn't even give Tenet's main character a name says it all. I suppose it's meant to add mystery, but really it just betrays the lack of development. It's really hard to invest in a guy when you don't know his back story, don't know his name, don't see his connections, don't really understand his motivations, and don't appreciate how he can summon large crews of elite soldiers to work for him. The Protagonist (John David Washington, channelling his dad from a better time travel movie, Deja Vu) is humanised slightly by his relationships with Robert Pattinson's angular Neil (the drinks scene, the goodbye scene with the Algorithm macguffin) and Elizabeth Debicki's somewhat wan Kat (you can see he is genuinely bothered about her). You also feel the equally-matched tension between him and Sator (Kenneth Branagh, hamming it up as usual, with a passable but still distracting Slavic accent). But the caring for Kat just seems tacked on to the Protagonist, because there is no romantic chemistry between them and you don't really see why he should be so motivated about this one woman he barely knows and her child who has the merest whisper of screen-time.Nolan writes his stuff without his brother Jonathan now, and the scripts are so plot-driven that there is little room for wit to sparkle or tension to build. There are some bus-ride exposition scenes that are just super-annoying as they might as well be to-the-camera lectures about sci-fi physics. The Protagonist makes the tired ""You haven't even bought me dinner"" joke when a flunky frisks him at Sator's dinner party. I kind of smirked just because I wanted to will the film into having a bit of fun or levity, but it takes itself way too seriously for that. You feel that John David Washington's energies have all been poured into running around forwards and then backwards, and he has been given so little space to exude panache or menace or pathos or humour or curiosity or fear.Another issue with Nolan is the perma-vanilla nature of the jeopardy. I really felt this in Inception, where faceless baddies shoot harmless bullets at the goodies and it's all so bland. It doesn't need to be Braveheart or Reservoir Dogs in terms of visceral threat and carnage, but as with so many superhero or thriller movies in the last decade, you don't ever really feel that anyone you care about is in any significant danger. Action scenes always seem like they are conducted in cold, clinical fight laboratories and they lack the grit and mess of some of the more crunchy hand-to-hand combats in Craig's Bond or Damon's Bourne. On a larger scale, the entire world is supposed to be under the impending threat of an extinction-level event when Sir Ken's FitBit trips out, but we feel almost nothing of this, despite the shockingly on-the-nose countdown clocks everywhere. A good film shouldn't make us feel so meh about the end of the world.I've focused more on character, dialogue and the feel of the movie, because so many others will be dissecting the mechanics of the plot, to infinity and back again. I just don't think it paid off. Yes, I think the time inversion trope kind of worked, but we shouldn't have to watch so many (admittedly brilliant) explanatory videos on YouTube to get a handle on them tricksy little backwards bullets (Heavy Spoilers makes a decent fist of stringing everything together in a digestible fashion).Tenet was cleverer than many other time-twisting movies, but much less fun and I couldn't connect with the human cyphers shoehorned into Christopher's Grand Design. So I'll finish with a list of other time-based movies and why they are all superior to Tenet:Deja Vu (starring the Protagonist Sr) is more exciting and interesting
Back to the Future is more fun and more engaging
Primer is more convincing and involving
Donnie Darko is more surreal and imaginative
Looper is more disturbing and edge-of-your-seat
Source Code is more agonising and fascinating
Bill & Ted's is funnier and goofier
Midnight in Paris is more musical and whimsical
Safety not Guaranteed is more indie and hokey
Groundhog Day is more entertaining and smile-inducing
Terminator 1 & 2 are more terrifying and adrenaline-pumping
Edge of Tomorrow is more Tom Cruisey and therefore more cheesy-gunghoSo watch any of those first, and then if you have another 7.5 hours free, watch Tenet (2.5 hours + 5 hours for all the YouTube explanatory videos!)."
730,"From now on, I'll know if someone understand movies based on the rating he gives Tenet.Tenet follows the basic plot of a 007 movie, while adding a convoluted sci-fi trick. This is enough to make a bad film.But it's way worse than that. Tenet is awfully difficult to follow, with absolutely no pay-off. It's just an autistic mind trip with no reason.The characters are one dimensional. The sub-plots are annoying, unnecessary, and almost impossible to follow in real-time.Pack this with top notch cinematography (that earn my 2 stars), unbearable music, hysteric editing and the overall hermeticism, and you have the most pretentious piece of moviemaking in the last decade (ok, Dunkirk was worse, but you get it).Last but not least, some pathetic dialogues about love and free will cement this as the perfect decoy for the wannabe movie critics."
731,"Generally a Christopher Nolan fan but couldn't wait for this film to end. Anyone giving this a good rating is pretending to have understood/enjoyed it to appear intelligent. I've seen one person give it 10/10, who wrote that they left the cinema confused and disappointed. Work that out. Why can't people be honest?The storyline is so confusing, with the idea that you'll understand it all in the end. Which means that you'll be sat frustrated for 2.5hrs waiting for everything to click. By the time it ""sort of"" does (and it doesn't really), you'll be way past the point of caring. The drama of the action sequences are lost because you've no idea what's happening or why.And as if it's not hard enough to follow already, the little crumbs of explanation that you are given every so often and garbled by the actors and drowned out by the film score, so any hope you had of understanding anything is gone.Because it's a time travel movie, there are a lot of scenes repeated, sort of in reverse order but not, and the back-and-forth re-runs are just frankly irritating.The only reason this doesn't get 1 star is because the visuals and sound are impressive (garbled acting aside).AVOID. Unless you want to try and be pretentious"
732,"Its ridiculous, the plot is a joke. Only people that enjoyed this are wired right into Nolan and his annoying ""Im so edgy"" scripts."
733,What is it with films just being loud to make up for no story ? Are we all morons that we sit here to listen just to music ? Please give us a film with a story and stop trying to make fools out of us.
734,"Disgusting movie.. loud music.. no depth
Just confusing low budget low quality movie."
735,"1. Time
2. Big Truck
3. Loud BGMThis time, too much talk and explanation.Overall, he succeeded to make audience's brain overloaded, but failed to entertain them."
736,Not really my cup of tea. I found it really hard to follow the plot. Robert Pattinson shines as bright as a star.
737,I started yawning after 10 minutes. At the 15 minutes mark my eyes started closing from boredom. After 15 minutes I just stopped watching the movie.Movies are made to entertain us. Not to confuse us and tire us with storylines so complex nobody wants to even sit and solve riddles and philosophical questions.I would rather watch Bambi on my old VHS player again. By now I don't even care who the director is or the actors for that matter.For me if you can't even beat Bambi on an old VHS tape then you have absolutely no right to be making any kind of movies whatever your name is.There is so much CGI in movies lately. Technically they are not live action films. They are cartoons. Therefore your competition is Bambi. Deal with it.
738,Waste of time and money. nothing right about this movie
739,"This film was beyond disappointing. I usually love Christopher Nolan movies and went in with an open mind not knowing much about the plot.
The writing is nonsensical in parts and just annoying or lazy in others. I couldn't tell if the characters dialogue was bad or if the acting was bad. There are no personalities to be found and the leads are all boring people that you struggle to care about. Why does the lead keep calling himself a protagonist and calling people antagonists? It's just weird.
There could have been quite a lot more edited out and some storylines just felt straight up useless, the film is too long and the villain... What a stupid useless reason for his end goal."
740,"I would like to say I understood the movie and hated/loved it or having real criticism for you people, but here is the truth: I could not understand the dialogue half the time and I have no idea what this movie was about. From the start you are entered into a LOUD, fast paced action. Now don't get me wrong, that was great, super excited. I love loud music, so when the chairs were vibrating I was excited (they WERE vibrating this isn't an analogy). Nevertheless as the Film continued I was not sure why I can't understand anything they were saying. This film requires remixing and lower down the volume of the soundtrack so that the dialogue is actually clear! I felt like I was in a night club trying to hear a conversation. On top, the characters were one dimensional, emotionless paper boards, zero character development. The plot? Goodluck trying to get it. Let me know what you found.The good? Fighting was cool. C'est tout!"
741,"This film was hugely disappointing. The story is lacking, acting is uninspired, and the relationships are poorly developed. If you take away the special effects and the sci-fi twist there really isn't much to talk about. I was really excited to see the film and may have had high expectations since I follow Nolan's work and know what he is capable of producing, but possibly these expectations led to my disappointment. I suppose I can give it another try in the future and see if this present assessment changes..."
742,"Looks like money rules in this movie.
Long story short."
743,"Something's happening at Kiyv opera building (which is really in Tallinn). Terrorists or something. Who knows?Then a protagonist dude (of unknown origin and employer) is introduced to premise of time going both ways. By someone. For some reason.Most of the movie he's after plutonium, but also a piece of art, because it's connected to time travel. How? ""Need to know!""There's classic Russian oligarch villain and his trophy wife. Wife cares about her son. Villain cares about time travel. And can end the world somehow.This all makes protagonist (of unknown origin and master) team up with Robert Pattinson (a mercenary of unknown origin and master) to hop around in Tallinn, Oslo (mostly still shot in Tallinn) and Italy to chase nuclear material because it's connected to time travel. How? Psst!After some time, they end up in ""closed city"", Russia (which looks nothing like Russia or any of it's ""closed cities"") with tons of soldiers (of unknown origin and master). The soldiers proceed to fight enemy that simply doesn't exist. They also get shot at non-existent enemy and so on. At this point I was thinking I'm watching Charades or pantomime - movie seriously shows zero enemies - zero!, aside henchman of the main villain.There's some stupid time travel twists that don't work as twist, because by that time, entire lack of any comprehensible logic is a huge ball of twist. Nobody cares about a lit match in full house fire.Now, if any of it makes any sense, I'd like to get in contact with your dealer, because those drugs must be at least as good as Nolan's.Tenet was absolute garbage. Perhaps it truly takes three times of re-watching to get any of this, but movie is too poor to even sit through it once. There's nothing good in there, despite all the action and open-ended questions.Basically, think of ""Inception"", shown in reverse, and without all the star power. Hell, it'd still be better (although I hated Inception)."
744,"Tenet is sure to be a film that's scrutinised, critiqued, over-analysed, and maybe even strongly disliked by some. When a movie gets hyped up like this, and so much of an emphasis is placed on its secrets, some people are sure to get disappointed. Of the disappointed, some are going to be very disappointed, and some might just be a little let down. That being said, these people might well be a vocal minority- I think Tenet does enough right, particularly in terms of its technical quality and spectacle, that most will enjoy it. Some may even find themselves loving it- it's hard to say for sure at this point.The plot is one I won't describe, as I went into this having somehow avoided every single trailer, and it added to my anticipation immensely. I wish I could avoid trailers for all movies going forward, especially for movies I already know I'll see. Somehow, I also avoided reviews, which is something I've never done before. I know there aren't a lot of reviews out there at the moment, but there were enough for me to maybe have some indication of whether or not the movie would deliver.Despite not knowing much about the plot, or even genre, there was still a great deal I was expecting, and in those departments, I was satisfied. I was hoping for a fast-paced, exciting, well-shot, and bombastically scored movie, and I pretty much got all of those things and then some. I think some people underestimate how difficult it is to pull off conceiving and then making a film of this size, and as such, we need to celebrate directors like Nolan, who play around with interesting, often ambitious ideas, but do so on a crazy scale, while also doing so in a way that appeals to wide audiences. Very few directors out there right now both can make movies like this, and will get given millions and millions of dollars to make something like this. That doesn't mean you have to like the movie of course, but I feel like it at least deserves a little respect.I don't think any actor in here gives their best performance ever or anything, but they're all solid. It's not really a movie ""about"" the acting, though the characters have a little more going on for them than the ones in Dunkirk, I can say that. John David Washington makes for a good lead, and Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki turn in solid supporting performances too. If there's anything close to a weak link, it might be Kenneth Branagh, who's occasionally a bit over-the-top, within a movie where no other actor really is. One other minor flaw with the film is a couple of quite glaring continuity errors in the film's first third: nothing major, but if I noticed a continuity error on just the first viewing, it's a pretty safe bet that others will too.I know I haven't said much to justify the fairly high rating I gave this, but I don't want to talk about the specific stuff I liked the most. I can say that it moves at a fantastic pace, never feeling overlong, even at two and a half hours. There are some fantastic set pieces, the action is all very satisfying, the score is great, and there are some very neat ideas that Nolan plays with, and develops further as the movie builds and builds to an exciting final half-hour.If you're in a relatively safe area of the world, and there are cinemas showing this, I can absolutely recommend seeing it on a big screen. It may lose something from being watched on a TV, so it is a shame it's being released at a time when some people need to stay indoors, but I guess that's just life at the moment.Tenet was the kind of big movie I didn't think I'd get to see this year, so I'm thankful for the opportunity to see it and experience it at the movies. There are nitpicks and things that don't fully add up, and things to overanalyse I'm sure, but for now, I'm just not interested in all honesty. There are too many other things in life that are slightly more pressing concerns at the moment.Like it if you like it, and don't like it if you didn't. Either way, Tenet's finally here, and hey, a potentially divisive movie starting a whole heap of conversations will always be better than a merely okay movie coming and going; becoming forgotten within the week."
745,"After an hour and a half we still had no idea what this film was about. The sound would deafen you but yet you couldn't make out lots of the dialogue...whats that all about? Plus the dialogue was being used to frantically explain what was going on...still had no idea. ""James Bond on steroids"" was the ad....James Bond on craic cocaine maybe!
Part of the opening violence included the protaganist having his teeth pulled out by a Russian baddie... and this film was classed suitable for 12's in Ireland???? I'd ask for my money back, though I know what I'd be told.. Don't waste your time and money on this one is my advice"
746,"I love a complex movie and im a Nolan fan also, one of my favourite movies is interstellar, but I went to this movie without knowing anything about the plot or characters as most people will and the first hour I was so so confused. Who is he, why is he there, whats going on? And thats fine because those questions are normally answered but they weren't. Also I dont like Washingtons acting, he was terrible in Blackklansman.Really really perplexed about this one, im just disappointed as it should have explained the characters backstory more apart from the Ukrainian and his wife as they were properly focused on."
747,"Very noisy, with lots of people firing guns without it being at all clear who they were firing at or why. Mumbled dialogue and poor story telling despite trying to be ""clever"" with the concept of reversal of entropy. Couple of good stunts saved the picture."
748,"If watching Dark was too hard to follow and you found yourself wishing the characters would say a lot of meaningless words at hyperspeed and were wondering ""what if the army was more involved here??"" then Tenet is the movie for you!Like the Irishman, Tenet's backbone is it's director, the rest, it seems, they felt would fall into place naturally. So what the audience gets is unbelievably cheesy writing, poor sound mixing, and no character development or history to make one care about anything. The effort just isn't here.3 stars because some of the visual effects were pleasing to look at and build up in some scenes was good, despite lack of payoff. Would not sit another 2.5 hours for this sloppy film."
749,"Can't understand the big love in for this film. Way too long. A confusing plot, wooden acting and a dreadful Eastern European ascent by Kenneth Brannagh. A few couples in the cinema left half way through and I wish I had joined them."
750,"I don't normally post reviews unless I feel strongly about a good or bad movie that may get miss guided reviews. In this case, I am surprised Tenet was actually given a budget to create such a big movie that had such a poor storyline. It was like Nolan tried to create another Inception including the obscure soundtrack, but the recipe didn't work at all this time. Time travel is always a great sci-fi subject if done well, and sometimes simplicity works better but the inverse/backwards time travel is not very entertaining nor interesting enough to invest 2.5 hours on. The main actors are definitely not to blame, but the lines for Russian bad guy K. Branagh were so long winded and meant to be meaningful but ended up being mumbled cliches that could put a kid to sleep instead of threatening. I didn't even understand who was fighting who and what they were fighting for, just a major let down that looked so promising from the trailers."
751,"He just shot 45-60 mins then he edited these 45-60mins to 90 mins playing backwards he put in ""is cause invert time travel BS"" and there you have it 150mins of garbage.
Its the recipie of Memento, he shot 15 mins and turned it to a 90 min movie and all the idiots said ""masteprice"".
Nolan is by far the most overrated director and after 4 garbages in row I think this movie is his final free pass."
752,Very confusing content with bad acting and also it was very boring. I slept in cinema really in the noise.
753,"I am actually a big Nolan Fan. Except of ""man of steel"" i was quite happy with all of his movies. Tenet is for me the second big disappointment. If you watch his films you are used to jump from one scene to another without big conversations or explanations which usually is ok, because somehow it makes sense. But tenet is jumping from one scene to another without making any sense. It starts in Kiev, goes on at the baltic sea, to England, India, Finland, Estonia, Vietnam and Italy. The plot is as diffuse as the choice of locations. It's told that there is the threat of a weapon which can invert time and it can cause the third world war. But while watching it i never understood it. How can it cause the world war? Who will use it? Why is it more dangerous than nuclear weapons? While watching it in the theater i thought i was missing a hint but reading the plot after the movie ended i thought it was a joke how non stringent the plot is. Besides all of this all the conversations were without humor and kind of cliché. The story of inverting time felt to me more like an excuse to use expensive special effects. I cannot recommend this movie."
754,"I never used to time related stories of Nolan . He manipulate everything in a way to confuse you. I saw this movie in Ultra AVX with that amazing sound theme and huge bass sounds was nail me to the chairs.
Story as always so pure with lots of science behind it. I saw this movie twice even with fear of COVID but finally helped me to understand most of it but still there is things I didn't get them.
I believe Nolan style is same as Michael Mann with spending huge money making scenes you never can imagine how is it possible."
755,"This was one of those movies you leave the theater excited about and wanting to tell all your friends to go see. Creative, suspenseful, thought provoking, good acting. Great flick."
756,Nolan is back ... one of the best movie of 2020.a bit confusing but great to watch .top notch.
757,One of best of 2020. Bit confusing but a masterpiece.
758,"TWO WORDS ONLY : MIND BLOWING.was already shaping up as the year's premier event movie before a certain global pandemic turned it into something closer to a holy grail: an unknown, unattainable object of intrigue, its enigmatic allure intensifying as it moved further and further away on the blighted release schedule. That's an absurd way to regard any film, but amid the business-minded panic and frustration of its chronic postponement, one wonders if director Christopher Nolan was secretly at least a little amused by the heightened mystique around it all. A blockbuster artist who tends to cocoon his works in ceremonial secrecy at the best of times, he has wound up releasing his 11th feature into an aptly disordered environment. A concrete cornucopia of global chaos and threat, in which humanity's survival depends on the minor matter of reshaping time and space, ""Tenet"" looks well suited to an anxious age."
759,"An amazingly dynamic story, stretching across a multitude of continuities that leaves you astonished as to how it was all put together in the first place. Excellently choreographed with an astonishing score. Its only drawbacks being its controversial sound design, and in my opinion, the lack of chemistry between saytor and his wife. To me I was over extending my suspension of disbelief to think that they had even been married in the first place."
760,This film is simple but brilliant. Very interesting and easy to follow for all ages. Best film ever brilliant young kids old people excellent
761,"One of those movies where you don't ever find out the main character's name. I found it really hard to get into. They don't really develop relationships or back stories for the characters, so it's hard to relate to or like them. I found it difficult to keep up with everything that was going on, sometimes you can't make out what the characters actually say, because they mumble and talk fast. I was really excited for this movie, it had great ideas, but was a real disappointment for me."
762,"MAN THIS IS JUST MASTERPIECE!!! I watched interstellar few years ago, that was just amazing to me, and this year, another legend movie came out and I got shocked again, this is SO GOOD, I just love Nolan's movies I guess"
763,"If you like to think through a movie as if you're studying physics! That's definitely a movie for you to watch more than once , and don't worry about reading spoilers, even if you watched the whole movie or read the script, you'll have to think again before getting the idea behind it . I definitely enjoyed it and wants more of Nolan's movies"
764,"If you liked:
Inception
The Dark Knight Rises
James Bond filmsChristopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. Not because his every movie is life-changing, but because he uses the art of cinema itself to its fullest extent. You are familiar with his work: Memento; The Dark Knight; Inception; The Prestige; Interstellar; Dunkirk. Throughout the years he has proven that he is not afraid of experiments and mind-bending challenges. He isn't afraid of complicated stories that the general audience might not ""accept"" because it makes their brains hurt. He doesn't just set the technical bar of filmmaking high, he basically is that bar. He is the Elon Musk of film. This is cutting edge cinema: always on top, never failing to amaze.I took a long pause from writing, and thought that his long anticipated ""Tenet"" would be a perfect movie to start again. How someone could write, film and direct something like this is beyond me. It famously took the main leads 5 hours just to read the script.
Now to what should you expect:It is a modern and intelligent espionage movie inspired by the James Bond films. I usually don't like spy movies, but this was very organic and never corny.It is fast and dynamic both in a sense of action and in how the plot itself unfolds. Just like with ""Inception"", you cannot watch it half-asleep, you have to pay attention throughout its whole 2,5 hour running time. It is a carefully crafted puzzle and should be viewed accordingly.It is a film that is 1000% worth watching at a cinema.In my opinion, the casting was also just perfect. There are obviously no huge tear-jerking Oscar-worthy dramatic performances, but the chemistry between the characters was perfect for the sake of that film. Huge shout-out to Robert Pattinson: even though he was not the main character, he just always steals the show from everyone once he is on the screen. His evolution from a teenage vampire to one of the best actors of today is worthy of another post which will come in the future.And above all it is just awesome. Go watch it."
765,"I love ""thinker"" movies, which is why I am a Christopher Nolan fan. And TENET is most definitely a thinker!! Great action, well-developed but complex storyline, good acting, crisp dialogue, and mind-bending concept. Loved it!! Even my wife stayed awake for the whole movie, and that, my friends, is a miracle!! The only knock I have is that (in typical Nolan fashion) the soundtrack is a tad too loud at times making the dialogue hard to understand, especially with all the characters' accents in this film."
766,"And prevent myself from seeing this garbage. Confusing, terrible acting, no tension or suspense. Christopher Nolan could film himself going to the washroom and his fanboys would give it 10/10."
767,"It's really good film, and a wonderful experience after months of not being able to go the cinema."
768,"458. Tenet. Well I loved it! I've seen it twice now, and admittedly the first time around my brainium in my cranium kept thinking about the whole technology of it all. I still thought it was a great action flick, but the time manipulation left me scratching the head for a minute or two. Second watch, however, I noticed one simple line as a 'scientist' character explains the tech to our main character: Don't think about, just react to it. Like most Nolan flicks you're thrown into the thick of things right away, the opera house scene from the trailer, and it never really lets up. Story is this, Spoilers, the protagonist is involved in some form of rescue or kidnapping depending on how you look at it, during which he sees something rather odd, a bullet hole in front of his face, seems to eject the bullet, travel right over his shoulder, through the man that was about to kill him, into the gun of another masked team member who quickly darts away, almost travelling back it time, but in regular time. But this doesn't matter because the mission goes south his cover is blown and he's tortured and commits suicide by swallowing a pill... And then he wakes up to find that being dead doesn't release you from your spy job, and because of the tech he witnessed he gets to hunt down the billionaire madman that created it, and like all billionaire mad men he wants to use the technology to destroy the world, possibly time and space along with it! John David Washington was cool, calm and collected as the Protagonist. Kenneth Branagh was a pretty convincing psychopath, his final scene is definitely brutal, deserved and deserves a golf clap. Future Batman, Robert Pattinson plays a Robin type character, Neil, who knows way too much! Great flick all around! Good movie to actually see on the big screen! Filmbufftim on FB."
769,"I entered the Theatre with high hopes, as Mr.Nolan is a true artist and he often produces wonderful visual spectacles. But in this case the movie was just far to complex and confusing where the confusion takes away from the lovely cinematography and sound mixing. The timelines and inversion aspects make the film surely interesting but a bit to interesting where you leave the Theatre with very little idea of what you just watched."
770,"This is where movies are all about! A realy distinctive storyline, beautiful cinematography and a sublime cast. God knows I love Christopher Nolan!Personally I think a movie is good when you still talk about it days after. I went with my teenage daughter of 17 and last days we are both surfing the net looking for explanations, conspiracies and making off's. The concept of this movie realy keeps us having interesting discussions at the diner table.To be honest, the first part of the movie was action packed but we didn't understand it at all. The volume in the IMAX theatre was extremely loud (or overwhelming) and sometimes even too much. I think some criticasters will have the same comments on this movie as on Interstellar. However, at the spectacular scene on the high way, my daughter and I looked at each other because we both had an aha-erlebnis.Okay, the uniqueness of the storyline isn't easy to comprehend for all. Please beware of the fact that ratings under 9 are given by people who don't truly understand the concept of non-linear thinking. I am possitive that having people watch the movie the second time, parts will fall into places.So be sure to give it a try...and a second..and visa versa.
nb. Reading this review backwards will give you an extra clue ;-)"
771,"Once again, Christopher Nolan proved why he is the only director in Hollywood to have big budgets with original ideas.
TENETis about using reversing time to prevent a possible war. It is reversing time, not time travel. The characters don't go back in time like we are used to in other movies, like Endgame or Back to the Future. Instead of that, in this universe exists moments where time flows forward and the other moments where the time goes backward, this means that the things we see happen in reverse motion. This is an incredibly confusing, mindblowing, and very though concept to create. An idea that only Nolan could creat and make a great film about it
I'm not gonna lie, this is a confusing movie, and a lot of people are going the leave the cinema very confused. But, this is an original Christopher Nolan movie, what else are you expecting? With this man, we are going to have an experience that is gonna makes us think and scratch our heads about what we just saw. if you don't like this kind of stuff and prefer a by the rules movies, TENET isn't for you. But if you are a Nolan fan (like myself), Tenet is not going to leave disappointed.
Just like Inception, TENET needs to be seen multiple times to truly understand the story and the concept. This isn't a bad thing by any means, it's actually what makes Nolan´s movies so good. And just like Inception, this isn't the type of movie to see on your livingroom or computer, this is the type of movie made for the big screen of the cinema."
772,"Fully immersed in it in the collision and interweaving of the forward and reverse time trajectories. Christopher is undoubtedly a maverick who insisted on telling stories and conquering the audience in his own way. The scenario is brainy and thrilling, so goes the soundtrack- but a little bit monotonous. Obviously You can see something inherited from Christopher's former works such as Memento and Interstellar.
It's truly a tough work for Chris and his team to conceive such a complicated concept and present it onscreen. What they did is far beyond just finishing it, and to some extent, bringing it to a marvelous standard.
But it's a petty that some of the concepts are actually paradoxes. As for the pacing, it's a little bit too quick and tensive, even relative to its theme of a spy game. It looks like that Chris has focused a little bit too much on the complexity and fitness to cinemas, and, as a result, lose something of his own. Given those above Tenet is actually secondary to Inception and Interstellar, where he made truly successful balance between Nolan films and traditional Hollywood films.
This may not be the best movie of Chris, but still a remarkable blockbuster. Just as the protagonist has it, don't trynna understand it, just get yourself absorbed in the thrilling time trajectories. You will definitely find it worthwhile."
773,"If you fully understand something it loses its magic.Tenet gives you just enough information that you can understand the whole story on a basic level by the time the movie ends, and to me this is the ideal amount of mystery and complexity. It was a very enjoyable experience for the first time, yet I cannot wait to go back and watch it again.However there are multiple times in the movie, where the lack of information is unnecessary. Times where you don't really understand what the characters' motives are: why are they planning a heist? who is the enemy they are shooting at? Note that these have nothing to do with the base sci fi element of the movie, they are just really poorly explained in the dialogues.Thankfully this is my only problem with Tenet, and that's why it's ""only"" 9 stars. All other criticizisms you read are completely invalid after you fully understanding the story. You have to watch Tenet with the benefit of the doubt, that everything wierd happening has a deep purpose in the film.Score, cast, action, locations are phenomenal as usual of course."
774,"The music/sound is extremely loud, to the point that it overwhelms character's dialog 70% of the time, I have never seen anything like this. I thought it was just me, but I saw quite a few reviews complaining the same thing. It makes an already overly-convoluted plot even harder to follow. At certain point, it starts to feel that the director is making it complex for the sole purpose of complexity. It doesn't really make the story more interesting or engaging."
775,"The movie makes little to no sense. I don't think it would matter how many times I watched it, the movie still wouldn't make any sense. It's basically the world's most expensive movie about theoretical physics. Sheldon Cooper would love this movie, I did not."
776,"I just saw this today in a Dolby Cinema at my local AMC. I didn't think I could have been more disappointed in a Nolan movie than Dunkirk. But I was with Tenent. I read a review elsewhere where the fist paragraph said something to the effect that this movie was perfect for BluRay because you could put subtitles on. I swear I couldn't hear half the dialog as the sound and music drowned it out. Some of the important dialogue, I think, was even given while the actors were wearing gas masks. Maybe the mix in the theater was off. But a number of other reviews have the same complaint. You'd think Nolan would have learned something from the Bane dialogue controversy. But he didn't. There might have been a good movie under all that sound, but I couldn't tell.As for the time travel stuff, I think I understood what they were getting at, but due to the inability to understand a lot of the dialogue coupled with too much action, I don't think he pulled it off. There are better stories involving time travel out there. The TV series 12 Monkeys is one."
777,"Tenet...what should I say about Tenet.
I actually don't know.
Christopher Nolan did another...yeah, another Christopher Nolan film.
I loved it at the first watch, I loved it even more on the second one and also now on the third watch.It was one of the best cinema experience I've ever had. The visuals are next level and the sound massaged my ears.
John David Washington and Robert Pattinson were both excellent.
Tenet is something special and made for cinema.For hours I could think of Tenet and what everything could happen or couldn't.
It's fascinating.
Nolan is a genius. He proofed that many times
Before and does it again and again."
778,"He did it again
Nolan likes to keep It confusing but i like confusing. The acting is great, the action its reminiscing of the dark night, the puzzles are at the same level of interstelar and Inception and the plot is... Go watch it"
779,"Here is my initial review which I stand behind and now that I have seen it twice I love this movie so much...""TENET"" Review: (spoiler-free)Big screen movies are officially (kind of) back and Christopher Nolan's mind-bending thriller ""Tenet"" is the welcome party back to the theater. Nolan, known mostly for delivering innovative and original big-budget films with a cerebral kick such as ""The Dark Knight"" ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", has once again returned to meddle with his favorite movie-making ingredient: TIME. ""Tenet"" is part spy-thriller with a James Bond like slickness combined with a brain tingling time-travel narrative. These elements are anything but conventional as the movie twists and turns with dizzying delight complete with breathtaking set pieces to rival any modern action movie. ""Tenet"" stars John David Washington (great DNA), as ""The Protagonist"" who is giving off some serious Clint Eastwood ""Man with No Name' vibes as ""The Protagonist"" never goes by any other title. Washington plays the character calmly and coolly as he brings an effortless charisma to a role that introduces us to a hidden world of modern day espionage. This hidden world in ""Tenet"", without wanting to reveal too much, is only understood by those who know objects, things, and even people can become ""inverted"" in the future. Being ""inverted"" essentially allows these objects and persons to be traveling backward in time meaning our perspective in present day comes with visualizing these ""inversions"" as backward-moving like a Michael Jackson moonwalk. Our ""Protagonist"" with the help of CIA agent friend Neil, a charming Robert Pattinson, has come to the realization that a man from the future seeks to use this ""inversion"" capability to cause a global crisis in our present time (think Bond villain scheme). Confused yet? Well no worries, for as baffling and mind-bending as the plot can be at times, you will not need to think much to understand how jaw-dropping it is to watch a car ""un-crash"" or a building ""un-explode"" (implode?) due to ""inversions"". This duality of plot confusion amongst stunning sequence after stunning sequence may have ""Tenet"" making you feel inverted and backwards. It is equal parts frustrating and fascinating leaving you perplexed throughout. The one positive takeaway for certain though is that Nolan has crafted a movie that is holistically original and unique which makes it a delight to experience. ""Tenet"" has that mind-provoking quality that will have you looking to return again for a second watch the second the screen goes to black. Personally, I feel my future self is the only one who can properly rate this movie after a solid rewatch (or two) but know that I found ""Tenet"" completely captivating despite being unnecessarily difficult and emotionless at times. ""Tenet"" is what the big screen is made for as it feels more like an experience rather than a movie. Make sure your future self also catches this one on the biggest screen possible before time runs out...Grade: A- (or do I have it backward?)"
780,"It's just an action movie. The first half is straight forward. The second half is allmost the same as the first half, only backwards. Not a bad action movie, but still an action movie. Explosions, shooting, jumping and jiving, a bad guy, a good guy,, a friend, and of course the girl who is rescued by the good guy and on the side he saves the world. So you don't have to see it twice, as some comments suggest to do. Just ignore lines as: Nice to have spoken to you in the future some years back. In fact it's just Back to the Future without humor. Still, you have to see it for yourself, because it still remains not a bad action movie. But don't expect to be flabbergasted."
781,"Christopher Nolan has gotten a lot of grief for the way he mixes his dialogue into the sound-mix on his last few films not to mention how he has characters speaking distortedly through various masks and mouth coverings. So it seems to me that with Tenet that he is perhaps trolling his critics by making about 70% of the dialogue in Tenet anywhere from hard to hear to straight up incomprehensible.
Anyways that aside we have a puzzle box of a movie that is easy to get the basic gist of the story line but the nuances and fuller understanding will probably come from multiple viewings. It is sure to split audiences but I feel somewhere in the middle where I could see the potential in the story and concepts but do not think the story telling is at its fullest entertainment wise. Keeping track of the moving parts is a bit exhausting but can be forgiven for the films positives.
The film is stunning looking and feels very large with its practical effects, location shoots and cinematography. The cast are great and well cast, Robert Pattinson's first scene conjures images of Klaus Kinski in Fitzcaraldo.
Lastly it seems unlike the muffled dialogue, one of his other criticisms has always been how poorly he shoots combat scenes and other types of fast moving action scenes. This has gotten a lot better in his last few films and in this film he consistently looks to have fixed this and see,s to know where to put the camera for these type of scenes. Al in all its a mixed bag where I admire the visual craft, the bombastic audio over shadows the dialogue and the story telling does not quite work.
6.5/10"
782,A bad way to spend $300 million and 2 1/2 hours. Effects are amateurish and plot is drivel. Like playing Monopoly. It never ends.
783,"This is a movie of stunt sequences. From the beginning of the movie the concept is not well explained to the viewer. As you go along and things are added to the concept, things get more complexed and you completely lose grasp of why things happen on the screen as it is.You end up watching action scenes, constantly going 'why' and 'how'.Worst dialogues I've heard in a Nolan movie and horrible sound mixing."
784,"Bad acting, script, audio recording and editing, video editing, cast, and 2 dimensional characters. Despite revealing the premise early on it just wondered in to some half assed save the damsel story line that didn't really work. Couple of contrived twists and then a huge scene that really didn't use the main mechanism to any great purpose. The 3 is for some of the cinematography and stunts only. If you're going to make a film that long it really should not be that hard to make it comprehensible in one sitting. I won't even bother to watch it twice because even if I completely 'got it' I really can't see it improving the score over all of the other un-overlookable flaws."
785,"Nothing to dislike about this movie at all.Cast and plot were great - I'm sure why people are insisting this movie is particularly difficult to follow and process, it's fine, actually more than fine.Well worth a watch."
786,"My review of Tenet (note: you can also try reading this post backwards)Q: Do I like this movie?
A: Yes, absolutely. My rating would be 8/10.Q: How much do I understand it?
A: Not entirely. It's extremely fast. But let's just say I understand it just enough to enjoy it.Q: How can I enjoy something I don't entirely understand?
A: The same way I enjoyed reading A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking. Certain parts of that book were way over my head. But the big picture presented in the book was so intriguing and eye opening, that I allow myself to look past the complicated details.Q: What physics knowledge did I have before watching the movie?
A: I read A Brief History of Time, Brief Answers to the Big Questions and Seven Brief Lessons on Physics. I really don't understand many things written in these 3 books, but I guess concepts like entropy, particle/anti-particle annihilation, time reversal, and parallel universes are not totally unfamiliar to me. So I guess I was not caught off guard during the movie. And no, these aren't the classical physics stuff we learnt in high school.Q: What do I not like about this movie?
A: Character development. The pace is just too fast for the audience to connect to the character.Q: Which other movies does this remind me of?
A: Memento and James Bond movies. Nolan is a fan of On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Strangely, this actually does not remind me of Inception much.Q: Would I recommend this movie to my friends?
A: Yes and no. Yes if you don't mind spending 2.5 hours only to get intrigued. Also yes, if you are entertained by James Bond movies, where operational details sometimes can be confusing, but the action sequences are good. Otherwise, no.P.S.: For James Bond fans, there is one scene very similar to the one where Bond mentioned ""Operation Grand Slam"" to stop Goldfinger from killing him."
787,"This is as good as Cinema gets. I didn't expect that Nolan would create such a original movie once again. This is never been done before. It's incredible - one of the best Movies I've ever sen and I actually think that This movie tops Inception.I have seen Tenet now 3 times for the last 2 weeks and tomorrow it's going to be my fourth time.Time never been put on screen like this before. Its mindblowing thrill ride with soundtrack, acting and action that has never been seen on the big screen!10/10I Will watch it again and again and again.The movie has exceptionelly a lot of hidden messages that will blow your mind when you figure it out. This is as I Said as good as cinema gets. Christopher Nolan is the only director that still makes cinema Alive and the only one that makes This big bold unique original movies.
Love This movie. This might be my favourite movie of all time.If you don't understand it see it again!"
788,Really really really mind bending ideas. Enjoy it with no expectations
789,"An epic spy action thriller film. A Masterpiece.
Christopher Nolan singlehandedly keeping the BIG SCREEN EXPERIENCE alive. Respect to Christopher Nolan.
This is Cinema.
Almost all other studios are going with CGI and tons of green screens. But shooting in camera is the right way to do it, and Nolan and his crews are keeping it alive. Love you Nolan."
790,"Nice movie,
High Budget,
Nice Action scenes, well choreographed.
Entertaining,
Filmed originally in IMAX Camera, as it should be.
Poor Acting,
Silly Plot,
Not Nolan's best.(Maybe because his Brother didn't write the movie, and maybe Christopher Nolan is not as good in writing as he's good in directing?)"
791,"This was the most difficult movie to follow ever. If I could understand it, it would be much better. But the plot is complicated, hard to follow, and importantly lines are difficult to hear. Went with two others and the three of us were very confused. Plus it's super long. Save your money."
792,"I have to say my expectations were pretty low for this. I was excited but not as much as I should have been. I was speechless once the movie ended. Definitely the most confusing of Nolan's movies. It starts off very fast paced but then slows down and has about 45 minutes of confusing dialogue and scenes that don't exactly make sense. Once you get past that the last hour and a half will leave you speechless. I was in awe, my jaw was dropped the whole time. One of Nolan's finest."
793,"The film opens with a massive attack on a huge, crowded auditorium by terrorists with serious weapons, bombs exploding on stage, people beaten.And....wait for it....Nobody runs. Not one person. And then, and only then, the terrorists gas everybody so they lie back in their seats and snooze. I guess that may be some of the clever cerebral time reversal stuff, whatever, but today in 2020 we have tons of the greatest art ever accomplished at the tips of fingers, and so..."
794,"The subject is repetitive. The movie is confusing and the subject is not handled in the proper way. To try to make unique, it gets confusing and it goes even to ""boring"".
It's been over rated. V"
795,My expectation were low but i have left more disappointed. I don't think this is a movie you can see only once and it was made as it is on purpose. Should I write notes on my second viewing ? No thank you. Movie shouldn't be a homework but something that i enjoy and for that i would come back to it again.
796,"If you can't understand a film by watching once it's not not worth a second viewing. Trying to understand this film is boring. Impressive filmmaking, dreadful story telling."
797,"The idea of inverted time is not a novel concept but it is still mind-blowing to see the plot of the movie going forward and backward at the same time. Yes the plot is quite complicated and Nolan indeed hid a hell lot of information in the scenes which are quite easy to miss if you are not paying close attention consistently. Yet it really feels satisfactory to be able to put all these clues together and see where the plot is actually going to. Acting by John David Washington and Robert Pattinson is excellent and the tension can be felt throughout the two and a half hour. One minor detail that is not so great about this movie is that the dialogue is quite hard to catch as the background music is really loud, which I know is necessary because of the atmosphere it is trying to create here. Another thing is that personally I feel that the storyline can be extended a bit longer as the transition at the ending feels somewhat abrupt to me. Overall a great movie that definitely worth a second watch!"
798,"Half of the movie it's impossible to decipher what is being said, as they are trying to talk with masks on and explosions in the background. Story is all over the place and it appears that the movie tries to mask it's ineptitude with over the top loud noises and lots of backward movement. That is about 2 hours of my life that I will never get back..."
799,The inversion concept is awesome but not very well executed. The audio mixing was bad. Could not understand half of the dialogue. The villain is too stereotypical and the dialogue is cringy at times.
800,"ITS BRILLIANT . The world is about to end and the time is ticking, but backwards. Well, for most part. Writer-Director Christopher Nolan's mysterious magnum opus is a film full of an eventuality that feels quite surreal in the precarious times we live in. 'Tenet' opens with a bang as a packed National Opera House in Kiev is invaded and is about to be blown to bits. This is a pre-cursor to quite a few such instances that infuse a dose of action and excitement even when the film's rather convoluted plot might bog you down. But that said, the overarching idea of its plot is fairly simple. It's about saving the world from an insanely powerful Russian arms dealer Andrei (Kenneth Branagh), who could go back and forth in time. Now, the idea is to beat him at his own game. But in execution, 'Tenet' is every bit the high-concept, make-believe and far-fetched flight of imagination that blends action, adventure and intrigue. And Christopher Nolan manages to use many of these opportunities quite effectively.
Our hero John David Washington (known only as the Protagonist) is explained the concept of 'temporal inversion' and sent off on a top-secret mission to save the world. He is joined by his British counterpart Neil (Robert Pattinson), whose origins remain a mystery throughout. The mission takes him places including Mumbai, where he breaks into a wealthy arms dealer's house for information where his wife Priya (Dimple Kapadia), gives him cryptic leads that cannot always be trusted. But it's only when he meets Andrei's estranged wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki) that he realizes the full potential of just how complex and diabolical the situation is.
The film's screenplay keeps underlining and explaining its layered plot about technology that can reverse time. Thankfully, it does so with stunning cinematography (Hoyte Van Hoytema) and action-packed scenes that are executed with a natural flair and finesse. The idea of going back in time where everything moves in reverse, creates a visually appealing imagery. And the original background score (Ludwig Göransson) is so unique and immersive that it builds just the right amount of urgency and tension.
Everyone is quite aptly cast including Dimple Kapadia, who lends a certain gravitas to her enigmatic character of a powerful Indian woman. She would much rather offer her husband's assassin a drink and pacify him than panic at the sudden break-in. Her role is not only crucial but also quite fascinating in the way she deals with the Protagonist. Robert Pattinson is charming but remains strictly in a supporting role, never overshadowing the Protagonist, played quite effectively by John David Washington. John's brooding persona and no-nonsense dialogue delivery is impactful. Elizabeth Debicki is honest in her part as an abused wife held to ransom by her chauvinist husband, but could have been more convincingly written. Kenneth Branagh's character of Andrei is quite the caricature of a Russian Mafioso with a typical accent and snarling dialogue delivery.
Just like most Nolan films, this one too demands full attention from its viewer, yet there is no guarantee you will comprehend the film's nuanced narrative in its totality. But that doesn't take away from enjoying the cinematic experience of Nolan's vivid imagination that is skillfully portrayed on the big screen. The secret to enjoy 'Tenet' lies in what a scientist, who is explaining inversion tells the Protagonist, ""Don't try to understand, feel it."""
801,"Core: do you like science fiction, action, intricate plot? Well, if it is so this movie is a must-to-watch!I think that with this movie Nolan outdoes himself!
The story can freaks you out (in a good way), the acting is unbelievably good (yes, I had some doubt about Denzel's son and Pattinson). The soundtrack is good too (but this is just personal taste).The first half of the movie is pretty much not understandable because of all the information that you'll be receive is a lot and disjointed. So you'll be a lot to process.
During the second half all the pieces connects to the other and it will be more clear.
Anyway, to comprehend it more I think I'll have to watch it at least another time!If you had watched also other Nolan's movie I think you'll can spot some similarity to his older movies blended together and a particular reference to his other movie (The Prestige). Or is it just me?So, Nolan with this movie does an unbelievable work. And when I'll watch it the second time will be better and more clear.
Thanks Nolan for this masterpiece!"
802,"There are so many movies nowadays that are mindless violence and action, with zero storyline. However, thank goodness for people like Christopher Nolan. Like 'Inception' and the brilliant 'Interstellar' this movie makes you think, ponder, and wonder. It's great to see a visually stunning and mysterious movie that is intelligently written, acted, and executed movie that still has all the action. I really enjoyed it!"
803,"Let's go through the good things first. Nolan creates another oneiric dream-like filmscape that visualizes imagination like no other, and Washington and Pattinson both deliver the material they are working with stoicly. The action set pieces are at times superb and the soundtrack is out of this world.But we need to talk about the sound mix, drowning out dialogue at the best of times and coming across as muddied with the continued reliance on characters using masks that alter their voice ala Bane. This wouldn't be a big issue if the film wasn't incredibly heavy with exposition, to the point that missing a line or two here or there can create significant plot holes. Honestly the film jumps from overly simple to obtuse, often within the same breath.It wants to one-up Timecop and Primer, but kind of fails to meet the excitement of the van Damme vehicle, by taking itself so seriously it hurts (Kenneth Branagh is wasted as a caricature) and is nowhere near as smart as it thinks it is when compared to Carruth's best practice of smart time travel.Half an hour too long, but I appreciate getting to see this on the big screen in 2020."
804,This is a fantastic action film and likely a very good film overall. I can't say because I only got 10% of the dialogue. The sound is horrible. A simple search on Googe for understanding dialogie in tenet shows that I am far from alone. With so much money and such great technology how do you produce a film that few will understand. If ever we need exposition from dialogue this is it. So I am left with a murky idea of what it's about and I guess I have to wait until it shows up in some other form so I can see subtitles. To me I should have walked out and asked for my money back.
805,"Although the first 45min are quite hard to follow the whole thing is a great entertainment. In my opinion there is not way you can get bored, there are lots of details and mini plots that you notice at the beginning and beautifully reveal right after half way. Great film I definitely will watch again. My only observation is with the sound. There are times that is really hard to follow the conversations ( I don't want to spoil but another viewers understand) I think it would be great to have subtitles."
806,"Tenet is the perfect example of a film being good and also disappointing at the same time. There was so much going on, and I can see most people having a headache by the end of it.From a filmmaking point-of-view, Tenet is near-perfect. The direction, the acting, the cinematography, the editing, the pacing, the musical score, and the sound design were all phenomenal.Unfortunately, I didn't find the script particularly good. Everything surrounding time inversion and the change in chronological direction was fascinating, and there were certain scenes that I loved, but I didn't find the screenplay particularly impressive on the whole. It seemed like Christopher Nolan was being too cocky and self-indulgent when writing it, and just trying to confuse the audience for the sake of confusing them.Tenet is an extremely hard film to follow, but that didn't play much into why I didn't find the screenplay great. The storylines just didn't interest me all that much, aside from a few elements, and it's not a film that I feel like going back and dissecting, like I do with Inception.That knocks this film back a lot, but it's still an amazing spectacle. My favourite aspect was when we saw a scene play out one way, and then Nolan would bring us back to it later but in the reverse direction. Everything like that was incredible, immersive, and engaging, but I just didn't connect with the story.John David Washington and Robert Pattinson were incredible, as was everyone in the film. There wasn't a weak link when it came to the acting. In fact, there wasn't really a single weak link in the film, aside from the mediocre screenplayOverall, whilst Tenet is brilliant from a filmmaking point-of-view, and it's definitely a good film, it's not something that I will be in a hurry to rewatch and I can only give it a mild recommendation.SCORE: 73%"
807,"I've just watched Tenet and these are my thoughts as of right now. What i liked the most were the unique action sequences, the cinematography which was well done and the score which was fitted in this movie nicely.As for the things i didn't quite like, i wish characters had more depth, because i didn't feel attached to them, but i guess it's hard to do it in a movie like this. Another thing i didn't like was the sound mixing. The dialog was quiet while the score was very loud. Fortunately i had subtitles which helped to understand otherwise i would be lost.The movie was quite tense, with fast-paced action scenes, so if you're fan of that then it's a must see especially on IMAX screen.Overall i did enjoy it and i will definitely watch again to have better understanding, but right now i'd give this movie score of 6.9/10"
808,"Cliche, corny storyline. Amateurish exposition. Vague concept explanation that leave you wondering whether you missed something. Even awkward dialogue at times.This was such a cool concept but ended up being a cheesy ""the fate of the world is up to you"" action movie with 0 payoff at the end. Once more people see this the IMDB rating will definitely will drop and override the fanboys blindly giving it a 10"
809,"This film start with a siege at the National Opera House, and the main character ""Protagonist"" been tortured scene! As turnout, this film is about two spies(Protagonist, and Neil) need to work together to take down a villain ""Sator"" by retrieve the Plutonium! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the annoying sound effect scene, overuse of the backwards action scene, overuse of the same fighting scene, overuse of the flashbacks scene, overuse of the main character asking question scene, and overuse of the mask-up scene! Make the film painful to watch! Only intensity in the film is the explosion scene! At the end, Kat shot at Sator! Sator push by Kat into the water! The Protagonist make Priya kill herself, while watching Kat with her son! That's it! Another disappointed film!"
810,"Tenet basically was a confirmation of all of my concerns about Christopher Nolan's approach to moviemaking. He doesn't make movies for people to enjoy; he makes movies to confuse people. All of his movies are a giant shell game.The easiest thing in the world for someone to do is confuse them. It is incredibly easy to ask difficult questions. It's much harder to entertain people. Christopher Nolan doesn't want to entertain; he wants to make movies to prove that he is intelligent. After twenty or so years, he still doesn't think he's proven it enough to everyone.Let's be honest about Nolan's inspiration for this movie; he thought making a movie about videos set in reverse was cool and wanted to find a reason to center a film around this. None of it was entertaining nor did it make any sense. It's a trash movie. You could see around the scene they stepped into the time machine or whatever it was that they lost the plot. It was a contrived mess after that. If someone had $20 for Advil in the theater I watched it in, I would have paid it.It's sad to see such an amazing cast wasted like this. John David Washington has a bright future ahead of him but it was sad to see him starring front and center in a trash film like this that could ruin his career. Robert Pattinson, once again, bad choice of film that will also hurt his career. He needs to cut his hair if he wants to be taken seriously. Everything about him screams IT guy, not movie star. Elizabeth Debicki, loved her as always, would run away with her in 30 seconds flat if she asked me, but she's gotta take better films than this. She's also getting typecast too and needs to do something risky.I have to be honest, in a normal year, I think Tenet would have flopped. Word of mouth would have been bad and it would have been destroyed by the competition. Because it's pretty much the only game in town, it's dominated. It very well may be one of the last films to be released until better fare comes out next year. Everything is being delayed or brought to streaming. Something has to give. I hope Christopher Nolan reevaluates himself after this movie and comes back with something better in his next project. This film was a bit of a mess. He can do better and I would suggest doing movies with a good script and a relatable plot instead of trying to confuse people in an attempt to prove he is an intellectual."
811,"This film is generally great I for the most part followed it, then watched it again and fully got it. Don't listen to the people who are like "" oh it's rubbish I can't understand it"" that's just them. Give it a second watch. it is genuinely an amazing film and actually makes perfect sense if you allow for a world where the basic principles could happen. The plot is amazing, well acted and really interesting concept that is fun to wrap your head around. Go in with an open mindset and enjoy."
812,"I agree this is not the best of Nolan, but let's just forget for awhile that this movie is made by Nolan. Just admire it as a movie as it is. Don't think of it as a like a movie of it as inception. It's a masterpiece in its own. The kind of visual and the kind of movie making expertise is simply phenomenon. This is movie for people who like to think what happened, not for the one who walk in just for entertainment purposes."
813,"Tenet falls into this strange category where it both fails to commit to its time travel mechanic while also being hamstrung by those same ideals. The premise (people/things can be swapped to travel into the future/into the past) is somewhat unceremoniously introduced early in the film and then promptly forgotten for 30 minutes as the first act meaders into setting up future time travelling plot point. Because of this, the first half pacing is fairly shot through - characters shift haphazardly from goal to goal, people introduced and immediately forgotten, dialogue exposition-heavy and crammed into every corner. Add to that Nolan's (now somewhat ubiquitous) overly loud sound mixes and it's a fairly disorienting first 90 minutes that's difficult to decipher.The haphazard setup of the first half therefore seems determined to prepare a massive palindrome-esque third act that somehow fails to materialise. There are some clever effects and fight scenes yes, but they seem somewhat lacklustre in the face of the damage done to the first act trying to incorporate them. It almost seems like Nolan expects us to blow our load over the reverse effect even though it's been on youtube for years. Bits a pieces of buildings falling up/cars flipping back over, but nothing groundbreaking goes on here that can't be basically achieved with a handheld camera and basic video editing software.To be clear, this isn't the worst film ever; there are rewarding emotional moments plus good acting by Robert Pattinson throughout. These are not enough however to salvage the film from its particularly baffling first half. Worse film ever? No, though it could quite possibly be the worse Nolan film so far."
814,"Not worth the effort. Plain acting, unoriginal concept, too long and too loud. An unfortunate miscarriage between Inception and Memento."
815,"I grasped the premise. I understood the plot. But I just did not give a damn. The story was contrived and cliche from the beginning - Russian villains, secret tech (that's actually unnecessary to the story oddly) really boring characters and even more boring pacing. I actually felt like leaving halfway it was so pretentiously 'clever.' It would have made a decent time-heist film without all this 'inversion' BS which if we're honest, was a blunt contrivance to allow for cool looking backwards effects. This was a real REAL chore to get through. The two stars I did give it were for the effects and acting which were solid."
816,"I'll admit, it took me a while to fully wrap my head around the concept, but once I did, I realized how well thought out this movie is. Every aspect is perfected. 100%. The writers put hundreds of hours into this movie and it shows, because they took an impossibly complex concept and made it work. I cannot stress how much attention to detail the writers put in. No matter how deep you go into the implications of this plot, it still makes sense.The writing is fantastic. The main character is witty and charming, and all of the side characters are fully fleshed out. The CGI is really good; the way they mixed the backward in time action with the normal action was flawless.TL;DR 10/10 movie, but its really complex. Good luck wrapping your head around it; once you do you won't regret it."
817,Christopher Nolan makes films that engage every sense - even those beyond space and time. And if you have a chance to see TENET on the big screen with big sound - do so. You may be disoriented and questioning yourself and the film - but trust me - that is exactly what the storyteller wants from you. Give yourself to this film in a distraction free hifi zone (theater if possible) and simply enjoy. Nolan at the top of his game.
818,"First time watching it you're not gonna get it. The music is blasting, there are heavy accents, and masks are worn sometimes so you'll miss some dialogue. Additionally, it's fast paced so don't be discouraged if you don't know why suddenly they're doing what they're doing. You're gonna watch this movie like at least 4 times (like any Nolan movie) so don't try to get it all in one sitting. It's awesome and a lot of fun. I was mind blown."
819,"I won't spoil the movie. I saw the movie last night and it was a great movie. I'm a fan of Christopher Nolan. I love his style of movies like; Memento, Insomnia, The Dark Knight Trilogy, The Prestige, Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk. Those movies are of his work. Now Tenet and he did it again and with his own style, he created another masterpiece. Yes, Tenet is very complex and hard to follow. It's not like the Marvel movies or DC movies in which it's automatically easy to understand. You don't have to work hard and pay attention, but this movie forces you to have to think and figure it out like a math problem. If you don't get it, then you have to watch it again until you will get it. That's why I love Nolan, I know he always makes you really think about the plot. You can't say this movie is bad because you don't have to think and you can't understand Nolan's movies are a ""one time"" watching kind of movie. Watch it again and again until you get it. Again, it's like a math problem. I learned some people complained about how the sound mix was bad, and that the dialogue was hard to understand. I'm Deaf and I used CaptiView, closed captions at the movie theater. Try to use it and it will help you understand. Or you can wait until the rental release and turn on the subtitles. I would love to see it again. Recommend 10/10."
820,"If I could turn back time, perhaps I could stop myself from buying tickets for the movie. It has been 6 months since I went out to see a movie. I was really excited to be back in a movie theater and felt pretty safe with social distancing and wearing a mask. Maybe if I put the mask over my eyes it would have been a better experience. I believe there was a plot to this movie. However, I won't be watching the movie a second or third or fourth time in an effort to ""understand"" the plot. I was very disappointed by the cheesy dialogue and generally bad acting. I think I would have enjoyed it more if the Protagonist HAD died at the beginning of the movie---it would have been a very short movie which would have been a good thing. If only I could turn back time..."
821,"""Tenet"" wraps so many of the skills that Christopher Nolan has honed over his previous 10 films and puts them on high display. Like so many of his movies, this is a very plot-heavy story with a lot of exposition. Normally, an overuse of exposition irks me more than most things, but in films like ""The Prestige"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"" and ""Tenet"", it somehow feels not only appropriate but absolutely necessary. The only thing that type of dialogue tends to hurt is the characterization through much of the runtime. By the end of the story, we are given ample character motivation and dimension, which may make this an even better watch on a second viewing.Unfortunately, this is one of those movies that is nearly impossible to talk about without spoiling it."
822,"Watched it 3 times in IMAX theater and even wanting to rewatch it one more time, I have to admit that Tenet is better than Inception. It brought an riveting, intriguing and spectacular experience that we've never had before. Everything was on point. 10 out of 10."
823,"I like Christopher Nolan movies, but this one is not the best one he made.
The plot is confusing to understand, the low voices vs sound affects doesn't help, because you simply don't hear, what actors are saying.
Interesting idea, good special affects as usual."
824,"It doesn't surprise me to see so many low reviews from people saying that this movie is too complicated. This is not a Scorsese or a Spielberg film, this is Christopher Nolan. So many people now are just looking for cheap, easy and mindless emotional entertainment that they won't give this film a second thought.After seeing most of Nolan's films, the question was for me, ""how is Nolan going to pull off another mind bending film""? Let me just say he did. After all of his previous work, Nolan is taking it to a higher level. This film actually shows that he is elevating his craft.I have seen the movie three times now and Each time I watched it my understanding of the whole story has grown exponentially. The movie deals with the concept of time inversion in which characters from the future are lending information to people from the past. I believe that this is what Nolan had in mind for his audience to experience. I truly found that through my 3 times viewing this movie my past self was helping my current self understand better.This is masterful and creates a viewing experience that doesent waste money on a cheap action thriller.Some are badgering about the sound quality and I u sweat and it is a bit hard to understand. I have seen it in multiple theatres and some were bad and some were far better. I have learned that each word is carefully weighed out and lends to the better understanding. Try to watch this is a cinema with good sound quality!!Others are disappointed because the scenes seem too convoluted. For me, I felt that way at first because I didn't understand the premise. Once I did, I could see that the entire movie as a whole is perfectly executed leading you where it wants you to go.There are many details and clues that you will miss on your first viewing. Don't feel bad, I believe once you go back you will notice that every detail is well placed and thought out. It takes time going back to understand what you need to know and interestingly enough that is what the whole concept of the movie is about.I wholeheartedly disagree with any and all YouTube commentators that say that some scenes are just ""filler"". Go back and watch it again. In the end, you will understand the beginning."
825,"I know people will disagree, but I didn't connect to this movie at all on an emotional level. It really lacked any heart or emotion. It is so exposition heavy and plot driven that the characters are all very flat. Their delivery is also lacking in emotion. I won't go in to plot, but it was very confusing. Even with all the exposition, I still felt certain things were underexplained. It was also very difficult to understand much of the dialogue because of music, sound design, accents, etc. The movie was too LOUD. I saw it in IMAX, which may be why. Nolan's movies are very loud though generally. The visuals and the action of the film are the stand-outs for me. These scenes are very exciting, despite my many confusions.
One last thing, if you are sensitive to gun violence, skip this movie. The opening scene is very abrupt and evocative. Overall, despite the technical excellence and brilliance of Nolan, this film was colder than my dad in an Arctic snowstorm."
826,"First of all let me explain why the movie has to be seen multiple times to understanding. Basically explosions, sound effects and music are too loud and makes it impossible to understand certain important dialogs.
Most of the ""explanations"" in the movie are not in images but in dialogs between characters so if you did not understand what they say the next scenes might not make any sense (and in fact some of the did even if you understood).
TENET has more whole plots than a strainer; and I am not talking about the time going back and forward but the story around that does not make sense at all.
People from the future contact somebody dying and offer them fame and fortune if he accept to destroy the world.
How secret services are aware about that ? If they have ALL the information why they do not act realistically instead of infiltrate a BLACK guy in a white world.
The obsession of Washington with Elizabeth Debicki's character makes no sense. No spy will destroy everything to save a woman considering the world is at stake.
Elizabeth Debicki is an acceptable actress but she has been playing the same character of a victimized woman who hate her criminal husband and has no way to going out. Perhaps she never heard about divorce lawyers; but in any case a woman targeting rich men, enjoy the good life and then trying to go out are not victims and I do not see ""LOVE"" in the picture.
Washington is decent actor but not enough to be the macho protagonist and carrying the movie. He has some good scenes, but is not Denzel nor Sean Connery. Idris Elba could have been perfect (besides everybody talks with British accent here, so why the main character not?).
Pattinson is very charismatic as the good guy and Branagh terrifying as the baddy. Both are really the best in the movie.
Golden Globe winner Aaron Taylor-Johnson is quite good in his very small part (his accent is difficult to understand anyway), but the guy has charisma.
Now from Nolan. I really never liked him as a director. He is able to get spectacular images (and very high production values), but his stories are overlong and very lazy written. If you search the essence of any of his movies, could have been shorter and far less expensive.
He has good commercial nose; he made success of DUNKIRK which was the worse war movie ever. He show a defeated army escaping after the one of the worse military error in history but keep making the soldiers feel guilty instead on focusing on the errors of the commanding offices who never set a foot in near the battle. So basically he tried to make a pro war movie out of failure.
In brief; the movie deserves four points for the spectacular images and scenarios and a few nice special effects; but overall is VERY CONFUSING ON PURPOSE and big explanations are NEVER in images; just in very difficult to hear dialogs"

828,"I think this movie will divide viewers into 3 groups:1.) The group that thinks that this movie is a flawless masterpiece, like everything Christopher Nolan does, has ever done, and will ever do.2.) The group that argues that this movie is a vastly overrated pile of garbage, and who give the movie a lot of hate because they are angry about the brainless praise this movie gets from the Nolan fanboys.3.) The group that thinks that this movie had potential and is certainly not ""the worst Nolan ever"" (which is in fact ""Insomnia""), but still has a lot problems and is way too confusing.Needless to say, I belong to group 3.What I certainly like about this movie is that it encourages interesting thoughts about time travel. And you can see how much effort went into the production.But let's be honest: this movie has a lot of problems. A lot of logical holes and inconsistencies. Bad sound-mix. Bad dialogue which lacks build-up. Superficial characters which are hard to care about. Wooden fatuous acting, especially from the lead actor. Bad overloaded script with characters and a story whose only purpose is to serve the pretentious plot line. And A LOT of unnecessary (and maybe intentional) confusion for the sake of confusion.It looks like Nolan overstrained himself with this one. And like actors and even more so producers failed to restrain Nolan from going too wild with his ideas without anyone checking on whether the whole thing would work.I didn't hate it - but I didn't love it either. And I wish people would stop praising it as a masterpiece which it certainly is not and admit that the movie has a lot of problems.And if you have a cat that is moping all day and badly needs to be confused out of its rut and you cannot afford the services of Confuse-A-Cat Ltd., just show it this movie - it'll do the job just fine!"
829,"This is an entertaining movie, albeit it's a tad too long. I really enjoyed the action scenes as the were well made and fascinating. But thats about it. The story is ok. It's very complex, and I don't know, if I understood it all. Maybe a aecond viewing could provide some answers, but the movie wasn't really good enough for me, so that I would watch it again. Cause honestly, I don't really care for the answers.The characters had zero developent and you never really cared for any of them. The Protagonist had some preferences and made some choices, that wasn't very logical. Without saying too much, I often wondered why he would value certain things under these circumstances.The movie had zero charm. At one scene the protagonist try to makes some jokes, which could have been funny in another context. But Because the movie takes itself so serious the comic attempt fell to the floor as it just felt misplaced.Also, regarding the dialogue I felt like I was watching my kids lego ninjago series. A lot of the lines were said in this epic manner. ""We must save the world before it's too late!""So I never really figured out was this movie wanted to be. And I guess I won't as I won't be watching it again.But please watch it in the cinema as the action deserves that."
830,"My heart has raced before during movie sequences. I don't remember it racing so much during any of my previous experiences. For all those who have seen it, I am referring to the hallway fight sequence. You just know what I am talking about. And it's not just this sequence. There's so much more.And for all others who are yet to see, it is not at all what you think it will be. You are not ready for this. The industry is not ready for this. I don't think even Nolan thought he was ready for this after he saw the final edit. Just one word. TENET, for a long long time from now.Another word, would be simply EXQUISITE.10/10. (Might increase on my second watch)"
831,"As soon as I went out of the theatre after watching TENET, I was admittedly frustrated because I did not really understand what was going on in the second half of the movie. It felt like a huge bomb Nolan dropped on your brain and made it explode because there was so much information you had to process quickly to keep up with the storyline. And I'm saying this even though I never had any problem with understanding his previous works at the first viewing.But when I took my time to process everything and thought about all the elements of the film, I can surely say that this is Nolan's most ambitious work to date, call it his ""magnum opus"" if you will.1. The story is presented in the fashionable Nolanesque way of exposition through dialogue, although this time you will be thankful about any information given to you, because otherwise it would be really hard to keep up with the story. Besides from that the plot is given to you in a very precise and clever way through spectacular imagery only and never gives away too much. This keeps you invested in it and demands your full attention. Now I understand why Kenneth Branagh mentioned in an interview that the script feels ""like a puzzle"".2. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking. Hoyte Van Hoytema took cinema to another level by showing us the amazing ""Inversion"" theme in a very practical and impressive way. You will see pictures you will never forget again, because it is that unique and unbelievable. I kept asking myself ""How did they film this?""3. The action sequences are extremely suspenseful and are always accompanied by the extraordinary score by Ludwig Goransson. This man is a huge talent and made me forget about Hans Zimmer missing this time around. The music fit the scenes perfectly and added to the tension tremendously.4. The acting was superb. John David Washington and Robert Pattinson were amazing and sympathetic. They perfectly worked together as a duo. Elizabeth Debicki surprised me as a very emotional character with own motivations. She nailed the performance. Kenneth Branagh will send chills down your spine because he is evil to his bones.5. The editing was tight and maybe that is why you could feel overwhelmed by all the information given to you while watching it. I wish the movie would have been longer and some scenes would have more room to ""breathe"". Maybe Nolan made some quick cuts on purpose to add to the tension of his famous theme ""Time is running out"", but personally I believe the film would have benefited from a longer runtime, since it is very complex and needs some time to process. Nonetheless it motivates you to watch it a 2nd or maybe a 3rd time to fully grasp everything.Do not get crushed by the complexity of TENET. Let it sink in for a moment and you will realize that it was a genius piece of art.This is a movie which will be talked about and dissected into its puzzle pieces for years, maybe even decades. It will take some time until it will be fully appreciated.Edit: After a 2nd viewing I can confirm that this movie is a masterpiece in my opinion. It was way easier to follow and much more enjoyable. After understanding the key scenes they become even more spectacular."
832,Very complicated story and at the end when they couldn't make any sense they just brought the guy back from dead. Ridiculous. Don't waste your money on it.
833,"Unnecessary convoluted plot, loud music, weak acting, total disappointment for me! Nolan has lost his touch!"
834,As per usual Americans believe money makes a movie. Yet another lack lustre block buster. Messy and poorly executed.
835,"Innovative premise, decent performance from lead and support actors. Plot analogous to one of those stories children write when each one folds the paper so the next one can't see what has been written before. Perhaps the general sense of chaos of confusion was artistically what the auteur here was going for, but it does not make for entertaining viewing. Dialogue is so hackneyed and clunky at points it would make a good spoof of time travel films.. Much quantum nonsense and the tiresome use of characters explaining things ""to each other"" to polyfiller in the holes in the ""logic"". Save yourself 2 1/2 hours it's a dud."
836,"It is unlikely that with the visual power of certain images and that high sound and musical (abusive) treatment during all the film, at the end it does not concern you emotionally. The plot is confusing rather than complex, with less to say about the flow of time, trying to have some sense with the repeated theory of 9 algorithms (?). A pity as Christopher Nolan has other great and much better movies (and scripts) behind, like Memento or Inception.The film fails trying to give the plot an interesting weight based on conversations full of technicalities that do not lead to any very logical conclusion and with characters that follow the typical archetypes: superhero with cockyness who deciphers security codes like someone who adds 2 + 2, a bad histrionic who of course wants to end the world just because he is dying, mixed with an ecological none sense theory (and that has an army of people who support him ??) and a victim woman to help, of course, with zero charisma and quite cold during all the footage, who is supposed to fight and live just for her son (who almost we don't even see in the whole movie), no much better plots for the rest of the roles...The ending lacks any tension since you know that everything is going to work out well. The film is a clearly mix between ""James Bond"" and ""Mission Impossible"" films, but more efficient for the technological point of view than to the artistic."
837,"I just finished watching Christopher Nolan's ""Tenet."" Color me not impressed. If you want my honest opinion, the film strikes me as a monumental 300-million-dollar ego trip, one that may have even been intentionally designed to kill its audiences.I mean, think about it. The film's villain, Sator, knows that he's dying, so he engineers a multi-temporal plot to use future tech to take everyone else on the planet with him. This villain, played by Kenneth Branagh, is so warped and humorless that he's actually looking forward to this.Now think about the film itself. It's two and a half hours of utter humorlessness, so confusing that it almost *requires* multiple viewings, just to figure out WTF is going on. So what does Christopher Nolan DO with this film, when he finally finishes it? He releases it *only* in theaters. During a pandemic. To audiences who are going to find it so confusing that they'll have to go *back* to those theaters over and over to figure it out, in the process potentially exposing themselves to a fatal virus every time they do.I'm tempted to think that in the five years it purportedly took Nolan to complete this movie, he turned into his own villain, and is now consciously or subconsciously trying to kill his own audiences, while ensuring that they have as little fun watching the movie as humanly possible.That's my theory, and I'm stickin' with it. 🙂I *get* it. The dude loves James Bond movies. He's been wanting for years to make his own. But, being the egomaniac he is, he couldn't be content with just making an everyday James Bond movie. Noooooo. He had to make one that would make people think, ""My, how clever Christopher Nolan is."" So he made the film as *serious* and as twisty-turny and as incomprehensible as he possibly could.Color me not impressed by how clever he is. Sure, the action scenes are neat, almost all of them done in real life and in real time, as opposed to with CGI. And sure, the film is *almost* worth watching just for the opportunity to see 6'2"" Elizabeth Debicki walk across the screen in high heels. 🙂 But now that it's over, I find myself thinking not about how clever Christopher Nolan is, but about what a total dick he is.I mean, what's up with creating a film that almost requires Cliff Notes to explain it, and that is no fun even *when* you understand it, and then on top of that forcing audiences to go to a theater during a pandemic to see it, and thus possibly die? I'm telling you...total dick.Makes me glad I pirated the film and watched it at home. That way I get to live, write bad reviews like this one, distribute them widely, and possibly keep a few people from seeing it, thus keeping them alive.Heck, the way I see it, I'm more of a James Bond hero than Nolan's protagonist is. 🙂"
838,"It might have been a great movie, but how would I know? I probably caught 20% of the dialogue at most. I'm sure Christopher Nolan thinks he is artsy and cool and ""experiential"" as he puts it, but I lead extremely frustrated halfway through this movie. I stuck it out but I'll never see another Nolan movie in the theater again. I'll wait for it on TV so I can then on the subtitles."
839,I do not know what this movie is about. I do not know what any of the characters' names are. There is not a single scene in the entire movie where all of the dialogue is actually understandable. The audio mixing really is that bad.
840,"The Film is being criticized as confusing. Yes it is confusing but you have to THINK during this movie to figure out what is going on . Yes the film does explain a confusing scene a couple minutes later. The fight scenes are some of the best I have ever seen. The actors were all outstanding and did well with their roles. The soundtrack is one of the highlights of the film as it blares when an important scene is happening and makes the action all the more entertaining. Nolan has outdone himself with this film. It was just way more than I could of hoped for. The plot was interesting, confusing, entertaining and all the more just satisfying. The ending all makes sense. The Time related scenes are the highlight of this movie. Bravo Nolan you have done an incredible job!"
841,Had great expectations with this movie but I knew after 10 min it was gonna dissapoint...hard to follow ...no wow factor at all regarding the action...and seeing a topless Kenneth branagh at the end was a big no no...
842,Worst Nolan film I have watched. Dialogue very difficult if not impossible to hear above the background noise. Mediocre acting other than Branagh. Very disappointing.
843,"Vague story with a disturbing movie's events and sequences.
I don't recommend watching it in Cinema.
Save your money better."
844,"Wonderfully made, constantly makes you wonder how it was made.
Very immersive and gripping story along with acting.
Confusing introduction with all the dialogues and new characters, but once it clicks you're in for a treat."
845,I need to watch it more than 3 time to understand everything.
846,"I value the courage to accept the challenge to do a movie like this but unfortunately it does not work. The idea in which the plot is based is not well explained, making the movie incomprehensible. The spectator just disconnect from the movie and the plot does not make any effort to make it less complex. So you just watch at explosions and action with some aha moment in the climax.I love Nolan's work and I risked my life during the pandemic to go to the theater for this garbage. I respect the experimentation but this plot should never gone into production.Don't get fooled by the great trailer and previous Nolan's masterpieces: this is a failed movie."
847,"You're best off not reading too many reviews - Tenet is best unspoilt. Sure, like any ""time travel"" movie (air quotes needed here) it's not always easy to follow and Tenet does a real job on you. I feel some of the reviewer hate is really just anger at not getting it on the first 'third movie I watched today' viewing. And no, I don't think I'm spoiling anything by telling you it's a time-travelish mind bender, because you're tolled in the first scenes going in.There's definitely some flaws here - I didn't particularly like the innocent mother and child motivation of the protagonist, although I feel the kid might turn out to be more important in a sequel. Then again, Tenet is finished and I hope it doesn't get a sequel. It does a good job of exploring a really interesting sci-fi fantasy idea and I think it'll be on lists of 'favourite time travel movies' for decades to come.And like any time-travelley movie, there's some glaring plot holes and paradoxes that aren't really dealt with in a satisfying way. Then again, there's already more than enough exposure here and these kinds of movies are partly fun because of the figuring out you have to do after you walk out the theatre. Most of the holes, I could find some explanation for, but it would have been nice if there had been more subtle clues leading to those explanations. Perhaps upon a second or third viewing, which I'm likely to go for.If you're going in for an uncomplicated broody action romp, expecting the next Dark Knight, you may be disappointed. If you expect a mind bender with the clean simplicity of Memento, you may be a bit overwhelmed by Tenet. But Nolan delivers another movie that fits his oeuvre well and I think it's extremely enjoyable, although it may have a bit more cult appeal than blockbuster potential, which may be surprising given the budget and Nolan's director superstar status by now."
848,I am watching 30 min. Now and I don't understand what's happening here
849,Must See movie that will please Nolan fans and also attract new fans to fall for his dork like so many others have in the world.
850,"First all I'll say this is, to date, the only film I've ever had to walk out of the cinema from. And I've even sat through Movie 43.I'll start with a couple of positives. The 2 action sequences in the first hour and a half are semi-decent (even if the music score is deafening), and Robert Pattinson's acting was very good (despite not having a clue who his character is and his purpose in the film).Now on to the negatives. From the onset we are introduced to a nameless protagonist who works for some never confirmed organisation, and is then drafted into another never confirmed organisation. This character procedes to jump between locations in short scenes, meeting other dull characters who serve no purpose except leading the protagonist on an easter egg hunt and usually have completely unintelligible dialogue sequences. I'm not sure if this is a fault with the sound design, but this issue is not helped by other scenes where characters shout over fuzzy radio channels with the overwhelming musical score drowning them out.After an hour and a half, myself and my girlfriend still had no clue what was actually going on, who any characters were or understood the purpose of the scene.I do understand the concept of a reversed entropy bullet or object is difficult to comprehend, however this is not helped by a needlessly complex and confusing plotline. If you can even refer to this film as having a plotline."
851,"First of all, dumb people shouldn't be allowed to post reviews.Nolan nailed it!
Soundtrack Is awesome!People who need to understand a movie should watch The Disney channel.Just accept what you see and enjoy!"
852,"It ticks alot of boxes for me-
Guns. Cars. Fights. Goodies. Baddies. Loud noises.That said, I wouldn't watch it again. Uninspired performances from everyone involved. A little predictable at times whilst being difficult to follow!Too much action and not enough tension. A lack of character development for me.What is a Tenet? Dunno...6/10"
853,"I think this is the worst Nolan movie I have ever seen since memento and insomnia.
Yes time travelling theory looks enticing but he has taken viewers for a rough ride and it's more than over the top of everything... Wasted enough production set just to prove a point.
Why do you have to twist your arms and eat when you have athe plate in front of you and your arms are alright. I'd say audaciously atrocious.
Washington, Debecki and Pattinson shine but Branman steals the show!
Inception was super brilliantly executed but this falls short in every act. Nolan needs to get his act straight."
854,"After a pandemic which shut theatres across the world, I was hugely excited to have an excursion to the cinema to see a cinematic film in IMAX for the first time in ages. Truthfully, the day was brilliant and I don't regret a thing, however, the film made many regrettable choices. As the story unwinds and it reaches a halt, you have a startling realisation that nothing happened. No motive is ever explained. NO character ever even near touching a third dimension. And why do I always feel like Kenneth Branagh does Russian accents? Why do we never hire Russians?Lol. There's not that much more to say, the science is as flimsily explained as the character motives and despite some really epic sequences (bar the final one, wtf is going on?) it's just not a very good film and possibly one of Nolan's worst.It feels like there's nobody nearby to check him and actually doctor his scripts anymore.On the plus side, Lil Denzel might really be a big actor."
855,"Only Dunkirk was somewhat impressive out of Nolan's last many disasters, and even the story in that film was severely lacking to say the least. However at least it was an entertaining film, and I understood the story because I had already seen the old original film. This guy has completely lost his mind as a filmmaker. The kids still seem to love everything he touches ever since he made that constipated Batman trilogy. Bored nerds is the only way I can explain it. I'm going to go on record here and say that Sylvester Stallone's 1980's cheesefest action flick Cobra, was a far smarter film than this one. Seriously though, who the hell could ever even consider that this story would make for a good film? I'm at a loss. I'm giving this film a 3 out of 10 and honestly, that's pretty generous. I think I gave Cobra the same rating.3/10"
856,"A great premise as ever from Nolan and with a strong opening scene I was expecting great things. Unfortunately - not to be.The film is chock full of stilted, wooden performances from everyone except Branagh. But the biggest fail of all is the audio mix: Appalling is the only word I can muster. Large parts of the film are unintelligible, compounded by the fact that the protagonists are often wearing masks. Really Nolan? Really?
If the script is good - I couldn't hear 75% of it.
We were reduced to lip reading for a majority of the performance - a strategy ruined by Nolan's ever shifting camera work.There are some very odd editing decisions, some glaring continuity errors and as a result the whole thing feels more like a set of disparate actions scenes rather than a cohesive narrative.The story isn't particularly complicated. Many of the time-travel clues are easy to spot so the twists and turns aren't difficult to decipher - in fact they're the only part of the film that's accessible. This is a shame given the fact that the narrative as a whole is difficult to follow because of the terrible audio balance.
After the furore surrounding the Bane character in the Batman soundtrack - one might have thought that Nolan would have learned his lesson? Apparently not.My over-arching feeling walking away from the cinema was ""Did Nolan even watch that before putting it out?""A great opportunity that missed the mark by a country mile."
857,"Too long for its own good with an extremely poor explanation of its time travel gimmick.The beginning scene is really well executed from the way it immerses you with sound and music along with the situation surrounding it. I feel that everything goes down hill from there, the moment the time travel gimmick is introduced you're just expected to accept it without question.Some parts feel like you're watching the same movie twice at the same time except one is moving forward and the other movie is moving in reverse.The acting is fine for the most part, I just didn't give a crud about any of the characters, one of which I couldn't wait to get off screen.Christopher Nolan is a great director but that doesn't mean all of his ideas a gold, I'd honestly like to see a movie from Nolan that's of the Action genre on the scale of a Tenet or Inception without the gimmicks."
858,"Most people enjoy a movie that messes with your head, makes you think outside the box and that leaves a lasting impression. Tenet does this, but then oversteps the boundary and falls over a cliff.I, like most people, like movie that you need to use your head a bit to figure out whats going on, but it needs to be enjoyable. Tenet is not that, the frustration that comes from trying to figure out what goes on in the in this movie completely takes away the element that is enjoying a movie experience. Tenet loses the essence of what a film is supposed to be, entertainment. This film is not entertaining at all! Putting aside all the confusion about what's going, the characters are completely bland, John Washington and Robert Pattinson's characters are no more interesting than a blank piece of paper. Elizabeth Debicki, although acting very well in this movie, had a very dull character to work with. The script does not do much for the characters at all.Outside the box, yes it is. But I feel that most positive reviews are simply praising it because it is a Christopher Nolan movie and it is so outside the box, and nothing more - this does not make it a groundbreakingly good film, because it lacks all the other ingredients needed.Positives: it is strikingly beautiful to watch and the visual effects are phenomenal. And as much as the audio is criticised, I think the sound mixing is fantastic, the blend of real time audio with reverse sound effects for the alternate timelines is quite impressive. However, this is not enough to save this pile of landfill junk. I think time won't be kind to this movie."
859,"This is not magnificent, it's not a classic and it will never get better with age, first of all the movie runs in reverse never a good stream, and the plot is as thin as air at 40,000 feet."
860,Christopher Nolan is by far my favourite director but clearly I am not of sufficient intelligence to fully understand/appreciate this film. I can't tell if this is the greatest film ever made or a pile of nonsense but I will lean to the former as all of his films are masterpieces. Enjoyed watching it but spent large chunks playing catch-up as my brain cogs struggled.
861,"Was prepared to be amazed, impressed and emotionally involved. Only one out of three sadly. Visuals and effects are stunning. Set pieces and camera work stunning. Plot - was there one? Nolan kept it well hidden, perhaps all will be revealed in the sequel. Huh.Didn't care about any of the characters, not one remotely interesting or who you became vested in. If this was anyone else than Nolan and people said you have to watch it 3-4 times to understand it then I'd say, fair enough. But it seems that since the Dark Night Rises, Nolan has decided that being clever is preferable to being entertaining. Interstellar did for the wonder of the universe what Clive Dunn ('Grandad') did for the joy of music. Interstellar was just a maths puzzle. Dunkirk was like a dispassionate documentary with the focus on Harry Styles who played another of Nolan's ciphers. Only Tom Hardy's cameo at the end had any heart. The rest of the film is just so detached.Nolan hit a home run with Inception. It was another mind-bender but it had heart. You felt for the characters and their fate came to matter to you. Nothing he's done since has the warmth of Inception. In a hundred years the posters for Tenet and Interstellar will be on the walls of every Android fanboy. Humans will have given up on Nolan long before then."
862,"10 minutes in to the movie, Michael Caine comes in and mentions 5 people and 4 locations in the space of a few sentences. From there, I had no clue what the **** was going on. This movie is loud, pretentious and feels like homework.I know everyone is desperate to go to a theatre again, but give this a miss if you value the finite time you have in this life."
863,"This movie has two unworkable premises. The whole thing is based on the first time workable premise; a science-fiction premise that has no explanation plausible. As much as they try to explain it throughout the movie, you can't follow it from scene to scene. In the middle of the movie Is a long action scene that just lulls you to sleep because there's no point to it other than its action. By the time it's done, you're asleep and don't care what's going on anymore. The final scene is based on an action that you really don't understand - the point of it is clear but the cause of it is incomprehensible. I wish I knew the name of the gentleman that referred this movie to me because I will never trust his judgement again"
864,Watch this movie! Preferably in imax. After you have watched it you will be further entertained by the hours/days you will spend on reditt trying to figure out what happened
865,It's just nolan being nolan; it's a beautiful movie with some of the best acting you'll ever see. JDW and pattinson are going to be some of the best actors around for a while. the story is a bit confusing but not incoherent
866,"The best explanation for the movie is this sentence you can hear around 2 hrs past the film: ""don't get on the chopper if you can't stop thinking linear."" That's all there is to it. If you want to understand the movie , forget about any conventional ways of thinking or you will lose sight of what's happening . But even not completely understanding the film won't stop you from enjoying the masterful work of Christopher Nolan and the cast and crew. The power of the movie is apparent when everyone in the theater watching it , will have the same impression , the same reaction, the same ""wow"" at the same time all together. And that's proof enough"
867,"Great movie. It has a really good storyline, sometimes hard to follow but that's what makes it good."
868,"Okay lets start with why some people didnt like this movie. They couldnt understand it and they blamed the movie. Look, let me tell you something, casual watchers think themselves smart, and when they cant understand something, its never their fault - its always the movie's fault. For example they understood the interstellar , thought they were smart and thought that they were one of those ""rare"" people who understood the movie. However this is far from truth. Anyone who watches it carefully can understand it. But thats not the way casual viewer thinks. Like I said everybody views themselves as smart and when they cant understand it, movie is just bad to them.Now to the ""why is this movie so great""First of all music is great I am listening to the main theme while writing this.Plot is so detalied and so perfectly put up its hard to believe how nolan did this. If you wanna know what I'm talking about just google tenet plot explained.Characters are great and acting is great. Sators actor is just great. Especially bromance of neil and protagonist hooked me up to the movie and I really wanted to see these two succeed.Action scenes are immense and HARDEST TO SHOOT out there. We have seen millions of action scenes. None of them are this hard to shoot let me tell you.Inversion is a very cool concept and is perfectly added to the plot. I definitly want to see more of it. I hope there will be a tenet 2.The ending is good but bitter. Really makes you think.Now some answers to the critics;1) Characters are soulless they dont have characters and there is no plot development.Wrong. The protagonist has a golden heart and you can understand this if you watch closely. In the opera scene he doesnt have to save civilians, he does it anyway. In oslo when they are planning the plane attack he says "" there must be no civilians "" , and thats one of the reasons he cares about Kat. In the end when neil is walking to his own death he tries to save him by saying "" cant be change things if we do it differently"" plus he makes some jokes here and there.Sator is a narcicist maniac and arms dealer. The way he chooses to end the world with himself is pretty reasonable (for himself). Some people say its not realistic, well than you have never seen a megolomaniac in your life.Kat is not just a mother who tries save his sons life. She is also a woman who is trying to break free from the strings of a man and represents a lot of the woman in our present time who are oppressed by their egoist brute force user husbands / partners.Neil is my favoruite character. He is a charming funny man but more importantly he knows more than anyone because he was sent there. Moreover he is not afraid to make sacrifices for his mission, even his life. As we see at the end of the movie :(2) Why does Protagonist save Kat? There is no reason.Yes there is, to use Kat against Sator. And succeeds by the way.3) Why do people in the future are trying to destroy us? Its not explanied.I dont know how can anyone claim its not explained but it is explained. We understand this by the dialogue between sator and the main character. The reason is because of the global warming earth has become a hell. Only way for them to survive is killing their ancestors so that they (we) cant destroy the nature no more and their present will be fixed.4) The other claim I see a lot that movie is boring, trash, confusing etc. Well it is meant to be confusing and I dont really know what to say to people who say its boring. Well its your opinion. I wasnt bored. May be you have :( I wish you could enjoy it as well :(Tenet is overall an amazing movie. The people who did not understand it are casual viewers who want every plot detail in front of them with a golden plate. When that doesnt happen oh well, the movie is just bad.Tenet by ""acting, plot, pacing, music, grand final, twists, action scenes, dialogues, overall detail "" has won my heart and it is my favoruite movie right now. I am waiting for a Tenet 2."
869,"I have seen this film twice in the cinema recently. I had to go back a second time to comprehend what I had seen. On first viewing it's very difficult to follow and some of dialogue is over shadowed by a very loud score that seems to get louder and is almost a bit distracting.On second viewing I was able to enjoy it much more. I was able to follow it (a little) better than first viewing.If you enjoyed Inception you should enjoy this film.Is it better than Inception ? No! But, if you enjoyed Inception and interstellar this is a must watch."
870,Usual great sets and action but wrapped around a very mundane good guy / bad guy movie... the science don't match up in a confused fantasy sci-fi ... hopefully no 2 won't be similar
871,"The worst sound mixing of any film I've ever watched. My ears are actually ringing having come out of the cinema, the sound effects were that loud. Half the time, especially in the first half of the film, I couldn't hear what anyone was saying because random background noises were louder than the speech. I've checked with others who saw it in different cinemas and they've said similar. The story is overly convoluted, and the characters have no depth. There was some redeeming features - the action sequences do have some good moments, and I do feel like rewatching it but only to better understand it all. However overall, even the sound issues aside, it wasn't an enjoyable watch, and I can't imagine it would be a second time round."
872,"Sound mixing terrible.
Dialogue was incomprehensible in parts.
One dimensional characters. Except Pattinson (surprised myself there.)
Gimmicky special effects.
Turnstile, portal or carousel device seemed to be powered by action scenes without logic, reason, position or point in time. Perhaps powered by deafening sound effects. Plot holes aplenty.
End scene battle was confusing and silly.
Screenwriters that are blissfully unaware of what the word Algorithm means.
Excuse the brevity as my prior review did not meet the guidelines for submission.
If only Nolan was subject to the similar criteria for this vanity project.James Bond on acid according to the poster if you were to add following themes/aspects such as sexual scenes, a decent plot, actual proper sound production, audible dialogue, a worthy villain, scary henchmen, gadgets, fancy super-cars, a name for the Protagonist as well as some charisma and a dash of charm and a shave.Terrible, pretentious and pointless.
So far a huge disappointment of the year from someone who has seen all of Nolan's films."
873,"If you want to enjoy a real, interesting film which does tribute to many genres and film-making techniques, as well as screenplay styles, then TENET is your jam.
Outstanding filmmaking effort by Nolan and Co. Not much green screen mambo-jumbo, real stunts and a plot which will keep you thinking what the hell is happening at 50% of the film. Rewatching is also fun; I had the pleasure to watch it in IMAX again, but when it goes out on DVD, I think I ll watch it at least 2-3 times to delve into the intricate plot that Nolan made.
Kudos to the score, it really coated the action and the entire film in a fantastic way, keeping pace at all times.
I don't think I v seen something similar before in terms of non-linear filmmaking and although I was confused at start, I got into it halfway through and that was very rewarding.
9/10, good solid film."
874,OMG the best film I've ever watched it's made my year.It is very confusing but amazing scenes I would recommend this film
875,Saw it in a theater. I thought it was just the old theater we were in but after reading reviews it seems that we are not unique. Lots of dialogue with thick accents and with non-COVID masks makes an already difficult to follow concept even more difficult. I suggest subtitles.
876,"I got the general plot of the movie and apart from not being particularly interesting, it felt like 2.5 hours of punishment. I couldn't put my finger on it but it's just a cold movie, certainly not entertaining. I had a final opportunity to watch The Eight Hundred (fantastic in IMAX) but made the mistake of choosing Tenet. Big mistake. This movie will take a lot out of you."
877,"Nolan's passion for meta-cinema is crystal clear. The Prestige revolved around the implicit agreement between a director and its public (""you want to be fooled""). Inception's ending (the spinning top) was about the aim of cinema, that to instill under audience's skin the very doubt about its nature: is it just a dream-fiction or is it reality - and above all, does the answer make any difference at all on an experiential-emotional level? Interstellar's message was even subtler: the emergence of human meanings (love, guiding Cooper in the tesseract) may have top-down effects onto fundamental laws and the very fabric of spacetime, a causal loop jeopardizing the common prejudice that they are just 'illusions' adding nothing to the linear, reductionist view - a reference to the alleged 'illusions' created by cinema, whose connections with reality are far deeper than usually thought.Tenet pushes this attitude to its extreme consequences. The film, I suspect, is intended to be seen twice, and not just in order to better understand the plot. Inasmuch the same way as movie's characters leverage upon the 'temporal pincer movement' to improve their understanding of the events they are living, though aware that 'what has happened has happened', the second vision dramatically complements the first one. When you enter the cinema the second time you know that you are not going to see anything different, but while the first time you were furiously dragged by the action and the tangled plot, you now can look at the same events with the benefit of hindsight.How many times we feel, in our lives, pulled forward by the unavoidable irreversibility of time arrow, unable to understand all the complexity of what's going on, forced to just follow the flow of events? Everyday we accept, with respect to our lives, the same suggestion given to the protagonist: 'don't try to understand it, feel it'. And everyday, we desperately would like to be able to speak to our past selves, offering them future insights and wise advices out of our experiences. But we cannot. We can live our lives just once. Or does we? We cannot change the past, but this does not happen in Tenet either: as in this movie, the future does not modify the past, but just adds new information which helps us to shed new light on past events, to understand them better and better. Every new experience is a new way to see our past, to tell our story - the story which has us and only us as 'the Protagonist'.This is Tenet message: cinema allows us to live the same emotions again and again, to see ourselves mirrored in infinitely many different imaginary lives, and in this way to better grasp the only real life we have - and that we can only live 'fast forward'."
878,"The movie is just amazing and mind bending plot twists. Sir Nolan proved once again. Movie gets harder to understand but when you get it it explodes the mind. The sci-fi , action movie does not bores a minute but there is a single fault in the movie that you have watch it twice or thrice to understand the slot 😂 even I watched it 3 times and gave it a 10 stars we are expecting more movies like this from sir Christopher Nolan."
879,The movie is just amazing and mind bending I gave it a 10 10 star
880,"When I heard it was hard to understand I was a bit scared but after watching the film and getting all I didn't knew what people say it was hard, shows like Dark or movies like Back to the future have played with this concept, the director plays with a lot of concepts that explains and then show on action leading to a story east to follow if you understand what the characters meant to do, getting back to the cinema and watching something like this is a whole experience that everyone shod do"
881,"Complicated yes, but why not? It demands something of us as viewers.
The way this movies is done in all aspects is just brilliant. The filming is remarkable and the dialouges are first class, everything screams quality. Nolan is the best, as simple as that."
882,"Strong black lead, captivating plot, this movie was anA original experience, I really loved this because in this day and time of remakes, it was it's own thing, major problem with the movie is the audio though. Saw it with my girl who also loved it, going for a second screening. Top notch content."
883,"I don't even know if I can review this movie after watching it just once... because I was morbidly confused for 95% of this movie.Most film makers undermine the intelligence of their audience, but Christopher Nolan grossly overestimates it.I understood the concept of inversion... and thought it was actually rather cool. But the medium story in which Chris uses to show off this concept is so SO INCREDIBLY confusing and overly complicated... I have no idea what the F I just watched for two and a half hours. I felt like I was just looking at a bunch of moving pictures on a screen. Which wasn't entirely terrible because the visuals were really quite cool. Watching things explode in reverse was a treat! But I would have rather stayed home and watched some reversed explosion videos on YouTube, than watch this movie that just made me feel like a helpless idiot."
884,Great movie but the speech volume was horrible. Couldn't hear half of what they were talking about.
885,"Im not sure if this was due to the first movie i've seen since the cinemas reopen but i truly enjoyed this movie!If this was released the way Disney is going this would have been a solid 5 because i know it would have been played in the background and i would have lost the story within 5 minutes of the title showing. In the cinema with the full effects this was one of the most enjoyable movies in a long time to concentrate and understand the complexity of this movie.The enjoyment of this movie doesnt end at the final titles, the theories and details that have been sprinkled throughout this film is what makes Nolan a master writer and director. Schrödinger's cat and the Sator Square help to understand the inversion of the movie to ensure that this keeps you on a level with the brilliant mind-bending situations that the protagonist finds himself in. the concentration level you have to keep in the first 30 minutes are be tough but the pay offs seem low key but so effective.The tag line of Bond on acid is one of the move actuate reviews i've seen. Cool slick fight scenes (once you've seen the movie the first time) as this will baffle some initially. The car chase from the trailer has a whole different dimension in the movie. All acting was perfectly cast, as all Nolan films are, Washington has stepped out of his fathers footsteps, Pattinson's first main stream film in a while shedding all perceptions of previous films, Debicki, perfectly innocent until the going gets tough, Branagh, a manic with the ability to let lose.Its been a long time since being able to see a new film in its natural habitat but a great one to kick start!"
886,"If you read other reviews most of them talk about the sound problems and how you need to watch it more than once, but still they scored very high this movie. That's wrong: I should pay twice to understand it?
Well, I'm not watching it again until it's is out for streaming free. So with my one view I left the theatre confused and frustrated. My wife left before it was over, angry at the movie.
You see, it looked like a very interesting and complete story is happening or its about to happen but then you missed it, because you didn't hear or didn't understand some clue. In the final main action scene, I kept asking why is she doing that, what does it mean that red string the camera focuses on the backpack, who is who in the battle, etc.
The subtitles where in Arabic which I don't speak. They should be in English by default and come with a printed guide before you go in.
But I would argue that even with clear sound the story needed better editing or scenes that would allow you to understand and to connect.
That was another huge issue: the emotional connection to plot was quite low. Yes there is a girl in distress threatened by a monster, and the protagonist wants to save her, but between the two there's no romance, and should we care about her, if she was the monster's girlfriend.
But that's s very weak reason for the whole movie. What is driving the protagonist? Just that someone said ""the end of the world"", when he wakes up with no recollection of what is going on? Again, very weak emotion to push him to risk everything. Why is he doing it?
After I left the cinema I had to read the plot elsewhere, and even then it didn't sound very thrilling on its own. Again the poor emotional connection of the plot.In inception movie, also from Nolan, there was plenty of emotional connection with the protagonist dead wife popping up in his dream world unexpectedly, his kids waiting for him in the country he's not allowed to enter, and a history between the other characters.The production and acting are all of a big movie. But a miss in the dialogues/sound and the editing."
887,"I don't understand the bad reviews. This movie is absolutely amazing. Please don't blame the sound being bad and not being able to hear it properly on the movie, it is the cinema's fault. Some cinemas simply don't have a good sound system and just turn it up loud which can spoil a movie."
888,"Initially I thought there was something wrong with the audio at the cinema but then a friend of mine told me that she also couldn't understand a word at a different cinema she went to. Even the character speaking with a Russian accent I could not understand. With such a complex plot, it was a waste of time being at the cinema without having subtitles."
889,On the first viewing the film was disappointing because it seemed complex for complexity's sake. On second viewing the film clicks and is much more enjoyable and worth paying to see again.
890,So much potential but overall disappointing to say the least. If you can work out what went on in one watch then you are far better equipped than me. You better be willing to commit 5 hours to this movie cause one watch isn't going to do it. Sadly didn't measure up.
891,"Let's start with some positives.It looks like a Nolan film, that is to say, technically gloriois and expansive. Good performances, particularly from Debicki although Nolan has regurgitated her character from The Night Manager.The storyline is utterly meaningless and deliberately exhausting. It's so baffling that by the time you get close to figuring a scene out you've missed the next - and that happens over and over again, which in the end left me not caring about any of it.You'll go home, read painfully written CliffsNotes, and realise it was all pointless anyway. You'll feel annoyed at yourself for reading up about it, longing for a non-existent deep and meaningful. It's a big waste of time and, ultimately, unlike inception which had something powerful to say about perception and choice, or Interstellar which had something to say about dimensions and humanity, Tenet is a technically brilliant load of nonsense."
892,"Great Nolan classic, then about half way thru began to feel like he was trying to hard. It was classic Nolan, complex, good use of visuals and music, another Inception, then it wasn't. He tried to hard to be cool and the inconsistencies started to add up. I'm done. Wouldn't recommend this and won't go see it again."
893,"Man, is Nolan on a losing streak. Bad babbling efforts one after another. Put anyone else's name on his recent duds and release them shot for shot and they would have been trashed by the critics. This reminds me of M Night Shyamalan's skid down the drain. Kind of sad really..."
894,"This review contains very slight spoilers to Tenet and Inception.Tenet is a visual and audio spectacle made for the big screen. I watched it three times by now and loved it. The writing is incredibly intelligent and well thought out, the action is absolutely stunning, especially when considering almost everything was photographed on set instead of animated in a studio. Very typical for a Nolan film.
The music is extremely bombastic and has a lot of gravitas to it. My favourite tracks are the music right at the beginning and when you first get to see the 747 from beneath. Seriously, it's an absolute marvel on the big screen. I managed to watch it on a 600m² screen, the largest in Europe (Cinemagnum in Nürnberg) and it was definitely worth it. It's one of those big picture movies that absolutely needs to be seen on as large a screen as possible, with the best speaker system possible.The only two things I can seriously criticise without nitpicking are the weird sound mixing and the emotional distance between the characters and the audience. Let's start with the sound: the sound design is superb and the sound mixing during action sequences adds a lot to the cinematic experience. However, important pieces of dialogue are sometimes inaudible because of loud music and sound effects (The boat scene and every time someone talks with a mask on are especially bad, I probably missed 15% of dialogue throughout the film the first time I saw it). I realize this is a creative decision made by Nolan and I can respect that. He did the same in Interstellar and Dunkirk where he would use dialogue as just another sound effect that could be drowned out by music and explosions or shooting to underline the noise level during a particular scene. In those two films that made a lot of sense, I just felt that with Tenet, important dialogue gave way to not so important sound effects (like that weird boat scene). After my first viewing, I left the cinema slightly confused (although I absolutely enjoyed the film anyway). After seeing it multiple times I've had less problems with understanding sound.
The bigger ""problem"" for me is the emotional distance between characters and audience. Let me explain: In my eyes, Inception is Nolans best film to date, possibly the best film I have ever seen, certainly the film I've seen most. To me, it's cinematic perfection. Acting, music, sound editing, cinematography and writing are a joy to experience over and over again. What makes it stand out to me is the way it creates an emotional attachment to the main Character, Dom Cobb. We see flashbacks to his wife and children throughout the film, reminding us that Cobb's journey is about dealing with the loss of his wife and trying to get back to his children. One scene in particular actually brings me close to tears every single time I see it: when Cobb's kids phone him in the beginning and James asks where his mother is. This is one of my favourite scenes in all of cinema. The way the music shifts and the staging of that particular flashback to his wife perfectly show how important the emotional part to the story is. I didn't feel any of that with Tenet. The characters behave just the way they should, giving away as little as possible about themselves to protect Tenet and each member. That makes a lot of sense, it just doesn't create any emotional attachment to anyone. We don't know anything about The Protagonist or his partners in crime/time. There are some moments where the relationship between Kat, Max and Sator are explained, but not really shown. Show, don't tell.Overall, Tenet is an absolute spectacle, I love it and plan to watch it again in a cinema just to see that 747 again. Or the chase on the Estonian motorway. Or the absolutely brilliantly crafted inversion scenes that are like nothing I have ever experienced before on the big screen. Tenet is a jaw dropping experience that has the potential to become an instant classic for me and many others. You've done it again, Mr. Nolan, you've created something special and I salute you. One of the last great directors, pioneer of the IMAX format and saviour of cinema."
895,"Having seen Dunkirk (from the same director) I came to the cinema with high hopes and was genuinely disappointed.Nolan is revisiting old ideas. He has made an elitistic movie. Some will say it's too smart to understand but the truth is it's unnecessarily complicated, has plot gaps and is often ridiculous.On the bright side, Pattinson is good and Washington is a great action hero. Sound effects and music are excellent."
896,"Went to see ""Tenet"" last night.The acting is good, lots of action but it's seriously complicated. It involves time travel and you see the past, Present and future in some scenes at the same time.The score is a bit loud in places and in some parts the actors mubble a little.If sci fi is your things it's worth a watch, but it's a difficult film to understandThe set piece action scenes are amazing and it's a film which will require a second or third viewing.Nolan has a vision which is unique so different to any other director, his films are always thought provoking.Washington and the rest of the cast are excellent, Pattinson, Debicki and Branagh are faultlessBranagh is very menacing and puts in an excellent turn.I have scored the film an 9, but I feel this will go up on further viewings.Somethings are not meant to be easy, if you want simple watch Disney......... don't let the negative reviews about complexity put you off, its worth a watch."
897,"Literally made an account right now to say this movie is great. Its extremely confusing at first watch and the audio doesn't help it any better but after watching it a second time you come to realize just how greatly structured the movie when it deals with the concept of ""time inversion"".With all that being said the first watch basically butchers your mind to take on a second watch. You could watch the entire movie in reverse on the first watch and still understand as much when watching it regularly."
898,"Huge Nolan fan. This movie has great action and fight scenes. Really like the concept, but left with too many questions. Plot is difficult to follow. Often had hard time understanding what was said. Not sure if that was due to the IMAX theater or the sound mixing or actors mumbling. This is not the best Nolan film. He's done better."
899,"And perhaps that explains the persistence of releasing it when nothing else is out at the moment.
Nolan is an exceptional talent but this is a dud, albeit a beautiful dud."
900,This just seems so overly complicated. I'm not always great with films that really make you think and this was the case here. Also seemed unnecessarily loud at times. Some good action scenes but it's one of those films that I feel I've been sold a pup by the critics. Won't ever be watching this one again.
901,"I saw a few reviews saying that you need to see the movie twice, since the first time will be disappointing but the second will be brilliant. I agree, in that watched it once and was disappointed. I don't want to do it again. I already risked getting a virus once to go to the theatre and don't want to have to repeat that just to understand this movie. I go to the movies to be entertained, not to be fed a puzzle.This was competently made, but the story wasn't very engaging, and I was often bored with the (sometimes hard to discern) dialogue. Just over half way through I just wanted it to be over already.I had an interesting concept, some great Imax scenes and some OK action set pieces, but that's not enough to make an entertaining movie.I usually like Nolan movies, but this is not one of them."
902,"Tenet is a mediocre agent movie with a somewhat forced sci-fi twist. While well executed from a technical viewpoint, one can't help but notice a serious lack of artistry, tension or emotion. What on earth has happened to Nolan? There are no images that leave you stunned. No moments that make you hold on to your seat or gasping for breath. None of the characters have any kind of depth, which means that you couldn't care less what happens to them. Or to the world these hollow shells inhabit.There is plenty of action in various locations around the world, which at times makes Tenet seem like a Bond ripoff. But unfortunately the heart is missing. There's none of the style, the cool, the swagger, that the Daniel Craig era Bond movies ooze every minute. The scene with Michael Caine carries loads of that. Sadly enough, a couple of minutes later the momentum is lost again.Even with the bold time-bending gimmick, Tenet still feels like a generic action flick. Not a bad one, but not particularly good either.5/10 (enjoyable)"
903,I really struggled understanding the speach in the first half of the film. The audio needs fixing.
904,"Bad remake of Inception. Its too long, the plot is too difficult and the roles have hardly any immersion."
905,"Amazing! Truly one of the best works from Nolan. Great camera work. The characters are kinda linear, but that's typical in nolans movies. It really changes the way you see the world. Sounds crazy, but really left me thinking the whole other day. 96/100"
906,This movie is an incredible Achievement of film making. And if anybody who has rated it below 10 just didn't understand it and they should go see it again. Everything in this movie is amazing. The best Christopher Nolan movie to date
907,"Saw it for the first time in IMAX, definitely feel it..dont try to understand it at first.
Saw it again the next day, I couldn't resist. Nolan is a master of the art and the cast are all so incredible.
Robert pattinson does an incredible job as Neil,you can't help but fall in love with the character.
This movie will be analysed and watched for years to come. Its so incredibly complex, yet Nolan makes it a fairly easy watch with his incredible cinematography. The score is epic, but sometimes overrides the dialogue.The penultimate temporal pincer scene is just amazing i can't put into words how incredible that was. How he pulled that off....wow!! No one does cinema like nolan does.
As neil once said: ""Blimey"""
908,"Yesterday afternoon, I went to the local Cinema to watch Tenet. While the majority of the plot was kept very secretive, I knew that it was a science fiction thriller about time travel and something to do with preventing WW3 from the trailers. The presence of my favourite Indian Actress Dimple Kapadia was also somewhat of a pleasant surprise and having seen Christopher Nolan's previous work and having mixed reactions (for the record I hated Interstellar) I decided to give the film a chance.At a staggering runtime of 150 minutes, I found the film to be overlong, boring and rather tedious. While the trio of Washington, Pattison (who I look forward to seeing in The Batman) and Debicki, were rather good and showed great potential for future films, I was left very dissapointed with the storyline, the plot and unnecessarily complex structure which no doubt would have left many viewers confused. I did not appreciate the fact that the film gave a very anti Russian stance throughout. The references to the Tolstoy/Pugachev affair were totally unnecessary, hypocritical and used merely to paint Russian oligarchs in a bad light. Combined with the sudden shifts in jumping forward and backwards in time the film be and unwatchable.When we actually learn what the movie is about (not WW3 but rather environmental hysteria), then we also realise why the studios were not keen to reveal this to the audience as sane, reasonable people who use logic would have refused to see it. I myself walked out of the cinema in sheer disgust with 30 minutes of the film remaining, something that I have never done before. This film could easily have been a top class heist movie but they ruined it by taking it into the left wing direction that they went with.Christopher Nolan has lost alot of credibility as a director in my eyes. And I myself have always found him to be overrated. When Christopher Nolan made the second and third Batman films, he was asked about the speculation regarding the villains that would appear in those movies. What he did did was stick with the villains that we have seen for the last few decades. So once again we saw Batman vs the Joker. Not only that, he quiet snobbishly said that the Penguin, Mr Freeze and the Riddler would not have any place in his universe and difficult to interpret in a serious film. This is of course something that he was proved totally wrong with when we saw all 3 characters portrayed brilliantly in Gotham. And had Heath Ledger not passed away, then the The Dark Knight and Dark Knight Rises would have followed pretty much the same plot as the Frank Miller comic book 'The Dark Knight Returns'. To me that shows that he's a sub par director who just likes to stick with what has been done in the past and repeat it. Heath ledger's joker character was basically portrayed previously in the form of Tyler Durden from Fight Club. There was nothing new or special about that character, even though I liked Ledger's performance.I am also disgusted at mainstream film reviewers giving Christopher Nolan good reviews even though his films are sub par and quite simply unwatchable. And yet these reviewers were simply heaping praise on him because his name was in the credits.If you really want to see an intellectual and well thought out movie about time travel, don't waste your money on the overly long and boring Tenet. Instead, watch the Alex Garland TV series DEVS, which is without a shadow of a doubt a work of genius."
909,"Amazing music, production and visuals. And acting.But woah, that was a complicated film.
I've just read an in depth synopsis of the plot and while I understand it, I can't say it was an enjoyable experience watching it. It actually gave me a headache. The points where really important things were explained were rushed and hard to hear. I did roughly get the gist of it at the end, but yeh...too complicated to enjoy on a first watch. Repeat watches will definitely help, but it doesn't come close to Interstellar!"
910,"We see Nolan made so much effort for this, I apreciate. It has great action, great plot but there is absolutely no explanation for things dwhat they did, what happened, why happened, what caused it, why they needed to do it, what should they do, what should have they done, why should they do that, what is the nature of this... Also dialogues are faster than light. It is already so hard to understand or follow the movie and fast dialogues make it impossible. Guess that was not enough they also added some Phisics. You are already having so much difficulty throughout the movie with all theese reasons, and raid progression of story is making you so much tired at the end. What I mean is movie doesn't want you understand itself, when you are close to understand it, it is giving you brand new things. I had huge expectation from the movie, I wanted to love the movie but I think that is not possible because how can you love a thing that you are not even close to understand? I actually like compliaceted things, I understood and loved Dark, Donnie Darko, Inception... But this one is too much. They could at least give a us chance to understand somethings by not putting fastest dialogue of Hollywood."
911,"Tenet is packed with great action sequences an an incredible complex and compelling Story, but Nolan forgot that complex characters and their development throughout the movie is an essential aspect for making a masterpiece."
912,"""Tenet"" is a movie that really grows on you. It may disorient you at first as it brings you right into the action from the beginning but by the end you'll realize that everything has a meaning and you'll find yourself wanting to see the movie again to understand even more.
There are a lot of hidden details, really high rewatch value!"
913,"I couldn't understand the script, so I left the theater after 1h30m watching the movie. Very disappointed!"
914,"Almost left 90 minutes in. Sound was terrible, Had no idea what was going on. Maybe I'm dumb like other reviewers have mentioned."
915,"I believe Nolan is playing a Very Long and Specific game with Tenet. I have now seen it 4 times, (once in IMAX, Absolutely Worth It BTW). I degress..... The fact that the ""Main"" character (John D. Washington) is Never given a name, (aside from) ""The Protagonist"" is/was intentional but not for the obvious reasons.... but because he is Not the ""Main"" character (storywise), it is Neil. Neil is Not only the (spoiler) Son of Elizabeth Debicki's character, Kat and Kenneth Branaugh's, Sator, but most importantly lifelong friend, Ally and in many ways, Gaurdian Angel to ""The Protagonist"". He is the ""Key"" to understanding the timeline, the stakes and the importance of the narrative purpose of ""Inversion"" & the entire reason we are meant to care about any of them
and their journey in the 1st place.The ending sequence/3rd act (when truly understood) by paying the necessary attention to (in Uber detail) helps to explain and allow you to understand the reality of how Our perception of time and our emotional response based on it (within this story) are relative at best, at least until we settle in and attempt to completely comprehend the implications of the 'Grandfather Paradox'... As this component of the story is Extremely important within the films storyline, between The Protagonist, Sator and Neil and Time itself. Pay close attention to how many times/iterations and the effects Neil being inverted within the sequence in the underground cave have on your understanding of who/where and when Neil is within TENET.I LOVE Hans Zimmer and was initially upset he wasn't scoring this Nolan film... but L.V.G shines and creates a perfect balance of intensity, emotion, scope and harmony with Not only the visuals but with the entire idea of how Time and Posterity (as mentioned by the Protagonist) come together for an all emcompassing experience!If Nolan ever had a film thag will release and extended ""Director's Cut"".... it will be TENET. The 2.5 hour runtime (although slower in the beginning) once it picks up is the epidamy of a Artistic and Visually exceptional Palindrome!!!I will say this is Not a film to see once and understand it entirely, as with most Nolan films, but in my opinion, but with very viewing it becomes deeper more dimensionally layered nuances create a Puzzle unfolding in equal ways delightfully unexpected and rewarding!Undeniably a film that should be seen at least once on the Silver Screen... (if not twice!). 10 out of 10 for me, if for any other reason that it only gets better and better each time I have viewed it."
916,"Great spectacle of technical ability from Nolan and his team, as far as cinematography and actual set-piece go. And that's pretty it for the good side of Tenet. The bad side... where should I start? Dialogue that seems to have been ""crafted"" by a ten-year-old, plot line so convoluted your head will melt, characters so bland and robotic that they seem cartoonish at times... Oh my God, sitting in the movie theatre, after 7 months of isolation and no-cinema time, I really could not believe I even paid money to be tortured like this!"
917,"Dark Knight is my favorite movie of all time and I am a big Nolan fan, but... This movie is like when a person tries to use big words and act like they are smart, but just end up looking more like idiot."
918,"S A T O R - S + A + T + O + R = 19 + 1 + 20 + 15 + 18 = 73 - 7 + 3 = 10 - 1

919,"As told in the movie: ""Don't try to understand, feel it"" That is the motto of this movie.
Nolan says in interview that he was trying to do a cinematic experince.
Hence, you should definetly watch this movie on IMAX. It's nothing like you have ever watched. Totally different cinematic experience.Yes, there are flaws but these are tolerable when you let yourself go.Icannot forget the first 10 minutes. That feeling, bass pounding my heart. Always remember that.After movie ends, the taste in your mouth does not go away. There is an irresistible urge to watch again right after you exit the saloon
And i think i will watch again.Not the best movie Nolan made but definitely most interesting and thrilling one."
920,"You can thank Nolan for the disruptive premise, stunning visuals and demanding plot for the audience to catch. It needs more than 1 watch for a fully (of possible) or better understanding."
921,"Well friends, Christopher Nolan has done it again. Tenet is incredible.
Like Inception, you certainly have to put in some work to follow what's going on, but if you do pay close attention it's stuffed with ""lightbulb"" moments that are so satisfying.
Awesome visuals, cool premise, unbelievably rich plot.My only real complaint would be that the start is a bit too much talking, dense with easy-to-miss explanations. Of course if you can make it through that, then you'll catch up later and the rest of the movie is way worth it, in my opinion.8/10"
922,"Tenet is Nolan's last film and i think most magnificent one. It is really complicated but at the same time it's very affective and fascinating. You don't understand totally but Nolan too already doesn't wanna that . He just wanna we feel it and you absolutely are.
The main event is very foreground. So you don't contact with characters but it is not problem for me because you already can't focus on anything except the main event. Nolan already can't mention chracters more because otherwise he can't totally handle telling us the main event .
The watching it is very good. Scenes and visuals are very good. I really loved it. Film make you thinking it even after one day. Nolan's time chaos is really chaotic and you don't give up thinking that. You like it even if don't understand it. You can feel it in your vein(Of course that's my opinion). You should absolutely watch this film because now Nolan have done it again.( I suggest you should watch videos one that called ""Tenet explained"" after the film. They are really help to you for understanding the film)"
923,"This should hace been released with subtitles given the quality of the sound production.
The audio mix of the movie is horrible. Horrible to the point were key information is often missed and dialogues are inteligible. Even when they are having chats, there is loud music in the background masking some words.I had a hard time following the plot and half way through the movie I could not motivate myself to even care about it.The movie feels extremely too rushed, characters are flat and while I enjoyed the action and the performance of the actors, it feels their talent has been limited by a poor script.I don't regret spending the money but I'm not going to give this a second try w/ subtitles or whatever it is they do to it."
924,Christopher Nolan proves once again why he is the greatest director in the industry. This movie is absolutely breaktaking and has a very similar style as Inception. Robert Pattinson needs to be considered for best supporting actor! Never heard of John David Washington until I saw this movie and I was blown away by his performance as well!
925,"It was a action packed movie,with awesome effects, great acting, a little confusing but very entertaining."
926,"Messy, convoluted and far too long. In an attempt to create something thought provoking - a web of 2.75 hours of tangled babble is concocted. Whole basis of movie is lost amidst backwards and forwards explosions and garbled speaking."
927,"I was eager to see Tenet, as I appreciate the excellent films in Christopher Nolan's oeuvre. This endeavor is not up to par.The writing is not very good. It is quite ambitious and over-complicated. The dialogue is rather difficult to hear and thus, understand.The acting is stilted, limited in range, and lacks chemistry. Often times it seems the actors are merely repeating lines to one another rather than embodying the characters and genuinely engaging each other. I think I understand why; the complexity of the script must have been challenging to recall, let alone to believe it and own it. Robert Pattinson may bring the most life to his character, yet is still hit and miss. Ultimately, however, poor acting rests on the shoulders of the director.There are some bad edits that leave the flow choppy and in lack of continuity and coherence.The finale sequence is the most interesting and entertaining part of the movie, then Pattinson and Washington kill the vibe by explaining the plot to each other in yet more painfully stilted, and somewhat obvious, dialogue.There is much to unpack and the coding and puzzles are not lost on me, it just doesn't seem to be well executed.I had high hopes but am ultimately disappointed."
928,The first five minutes are ok then the film rapidly descends into nonsense. The premise is almost ridiculous as Kenneth Branaghs Russian accent and the film drags on and on. I loved Memento and Inception but this one doesn't work.
929,"Chaos. Nothing more, nothing less. Very disappointed by Mr. Nolan. Hoped this would be as good as Interstellar and Inception. How wrong can one be?Chaos, chaos, chaos. Terrible."
930,"A quick review here. Sound was poor, the music to loud and the speaking was muffled and hard to hear above the loud music. The plot was a bit confusing and hard to follow not helped by the poor sound.
Did I mention the sound was poor?"
931,"Confusing,complicated, and far too noisy. Christopher Nolan tries far to hard to make a movie that will entertain and thrill the audience, his brief must be let's make something that will confuse the audience to the point that most won't even understand what's going on, but in order not to seem stupid or thick they will review and score it as a masterpiece.
I'm all for a detailed plot with intelligent actors playing their parts to perfection but even they must have thought what's going on, what did I do and what was that last scene all about, just to further confuse the paying punters (only 5 in the cinema) let's all mumble most of our lines and crank the music up to headache inducing sound levels. I love a movie, I love to be entertained and can appreciate well acted, well understood dialogue with a plot that makes at least a reasonable stab at being seen,heard and understood. This came across as a bit of pretentious posturing at how clever am I putting all this together.Rated at 6 for the effort put in by the cast to complete the film, but I suppose they all got well paid and Sir Michael Caine probably can't believe he is still getting the call, but jobs for the boys (Batman) goes on in every walk of life."
932,"Usualy when a lot of people feel dumb after watching a movie because they didn't understand the story, is a good sign that the movie itself knows what it's doing. But i'm gonna straight up say that Tenet and Nolan HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEIR AUDIENCE WANT!Tenet is based on inconsistency. The action packed are amazing, the score was maginificient and the cinematography are beyond word. I was ready to enjoy the movie with my popcorn, until they slip the time bending manauver thing that makes me leave my popcorn to cold till the end, cause i'm busy trying to figure it out what's going on. I did not enjoy the movie at all! they are adding more and more detail to the plot and won't bother to explain it (while they should) just to make everything looks more chaos, and selfishly demand us to do a rewatch? Is this some kind of a new marketing stuff?Tenet give us a premises of an action, next they gave us a time bending manauver that they didn't bother to explain, finally
the action blend with it, and we are forced to keep up while our brain still wondering? Sorry, the feeling didn't makes us WOW, but instead it makes us WHAT?..and that's not a good sign for an action moviesNolan was good at this i remember, Momento is exactly dealing with this backwards kind of plot, but what makes Momento so much more better? They offer the audience with an actual character study. How are we suppose to invest with the story, if the only one have a background and motivation is the sidekick, and they didn't even care to name the protagonist?"
933,"It's very clear as soon as you hit the ten minute mark that you are in for a brain training class.Tenet follows suit from inception in mind frying the spectators, but it's worth it. It is epic on every level and is one of the best films I've ever watched. It builds levels like no other and keeps you second guessing until the final credits."
934,"This is hands down the most confusing film ive ever seen, at no point fid i have a clue what was going on and i hated every second post trailers.WORST MOVIE EVER.."
935,After watching it im truly not understand what this movie wants to express
936,"Too bad that Nolan is just milking the stuff he is famous for. Being confusing. We have this totally nonsensical premise of reversing entropy being shown in it. If you think for a few seconds about the concept being shown, you'll see that it's stupid. It can't really happen in that movie's universe. They're contradicting their own internal logic. But it has become like the Emperor's new clothes.The stunts and action scenes were kind of good. But not so great. Some scenes with the reverse action scenes were interesting to watch but they couldn't sustain that intrigue. Seeing one such fight scene was enough. They have overdone it.
Music too was good. That was the only thing telling the viewers the supposed importance of some scenes I guess. Without the compelling music, more people would've seen the bluff.They've added that mandatory female character who is supposed to get all the sympathies from the viewers. As if the nonsensical premise was not enough. In Inception we have the dead wife in memory form. In Memento, it all revolves around him going for revenge as they killed his wife. In Interstellar, it's the daughter. They don't even acknowledge the son's presence. Why does Nolan have to have such a female character with all those family emotions added to it? The world is going to end in Tenet and are we supposed to care about this woman and the son whom she loves? They don't even show that son I guess. And the villain behaving badly to her doesn't evoke sympathy at all.
As for acting, John David Washington is not so great. Barely does what he is supposed to do. Robert Pattinson is good. As is Elizabeth Debicki. Kenneth Branagh too is very good. Aaron-Taylor Johnson delivers, unlike the last time, when he played an army guy in Godzilla.Due to the stupid and pretentious premise, the whole movie becomes a pain to watch. Should've at least made a few cuts to make it bearable. This is just him throwing crap at us knowing very well that disliking his films would make one look stupid in others' eyes. Skip this one. He reached his highest point in Inception. Haven't really topped that one later."
937,"Watching this movie at VMAX at Event Cinemas in Burwood, NSW Australia.
The diagloue 40% of the time is inaduable.
The action scenes and budget expenditure are breathtaking.
Had to watch a YouTube explanation with respect to the entirely of the movie.
I would recommend at theatres play the movie with subtitles.
If Christopher Nolan sought to explain the movie more throughout and the dialogue was audible, it would deserve an 8 out of 10, however it did not so a 5 out of 10 is worthy."
938,"I do not really know what this movie is about. This usually happens with Christopher Nolan movies with me. There's lots of stuff and it's interesting to watch and there are clear good guys and bad guys.But what really makes a Nolan movie good to me is the character development. I care about the heroes. I worry about them. I don't want them to be hurt or killed. The hero of this movie is simply called The Protagonist, as though that's really all we need to know about him. He's the good guy. He'll take us through this. We'll be ok if we just stay with him.So who knows what Tenet is about. I don't think it matters. What matters is I cared about what happened, even though I didn't understand it. Metaphor for life maybe?"
939,"Another unsolvable puzzle by Cristopher Nolan.
I never really liked Cristopher Nolan's films. I always thought of them as too dark, too serious, and too pretentious. However, with Tenet coming out, I decided to give the director one more chance. Maybe I was missing something? Maybe this time I could figure out what the hype was all about.... Well I was wrong.The film takes place in (as usual in C.N. films) a realistic world in the near future. I have to say that I lost interest at the moment when we saw the bullet flying backwards for the first time. How could that ever be possible? I searched for possible answers in my mind and I could find no answer. ''Don't try to understand'' the woman said at the end of that scene. ''That's easy.'' I tought.Since this whole past/present thing is presented in a really realistic way, there is no way this is a case of suspension of disbilief. If that was the case then the need for an explanation would vanish beneath the great wave of my indifference. But that wasn't the case.
This whole past/present/reverse time thing was presented as true and real and it just felt silly to me. I sometimes started laughing aloud, since the so called explications went on. And on. In fact, the rest of the film felt like it served almost entirely as a explication on why all of this situation was possible. The worst thing, after all, was how these ''explications'' were executed... Through DIALOGUE. And since I felt ZERO sympathy for the characters (the great director didn't offer the actors any opportunity to show their human side), the dialogue was terribly boring boring BORING. They tried to make it more interesting by alternating the talking with some flashbacks. That felt very cheap. The fighting scenes were cheaply executed as well. A shaky camera and some fast cuts to cover up for the actors who can't really fight.I hadn't the feeling there was ANYTHING at stake during the enitre film. It was said they were preventing world war III but it is never shown. Also, it felt like there wasn't any variation in the kind of scenes... Some fighting, some dialogue. Some fighting again. Etc. It felt very monotonous because there wasn't any emotion. On the contrary: it felt utterly mechanic.One positive thing I can say about this movie is that the special effects were really nicely done. But just some good special effects doesn't mean a movie is any good.A soulless film. Even technically or visually not that interesting.
They robbed me of my 10 bucks. It is also the first time it occured to me to actually walk out while watching a film at the movies. Don't believe the hype. Still giving this 3 stars for the special effects."
940,"Tenet explores the concepts of time inversion,the reversal of time,etc.and damn it's so complicated therefore you probably won't understand it in your first time watching it...specially the ending takes a lot of time and thinking to understand what was really going on...
Tenet is a full package of what a great film should be,fantastic performances by actors specially john david washington,music is amazing,beautiful cinematography,and as always legendary script and direction by the one and only christopher nolan."
941,I would not recommend this to friends. There are no interesting characters and the storyline is uninspiring. Can not be compared to other nolan movies at all. Really disappointing.
942,"I'm a Nolan fan and love a complex film. Unfortunately, this didn't cut it.Washington was excruciating to watch. It was like watching a child trying to pull off the role of an adult. I felt embarrassed for the guy.No depth to any characters, hard to hear their lines, the story seemed gimmicky. Couldn't wait for it to finish.If you still want to see it, I recommend waiting for tv release."
943,"The story is unnecessarily complex and extremely cheesy. Bad acting, dry conversations. The whole movie feels like an emotionless rush.
You cannot cover the emptiness of the story with complexity.
I expected something better from Nolan after 3 years, very disappointing.."
944,"It was not the film I was expecting. Tenet is a self-indulgent mess, that shows no signs of growth for Christopher Nolan as a filmmaker. It was plain stupid of Nolan to make this horrible film when he could of made something much better. The concept is wasted. This film is every bit as ludicrous, overly long, pretentious and exposition heavy as you expect it to be. It's Nolan at his most self indulgent who fails to deliver. The writing is just flat. The characters are bland, the dialogues are cheesy, the sound mixing is absolutely horrible, the action falls short to impress and the score was even a miss for me. All in all good actors and a good concept is wasted in Christopher Nolan's self-indulgent convoluted mess of a movie. I'm going to boycott every Nolan production from now on. Goodbye to this pretentious filmmaker. May he learn from all these negative reviews and change for the better."
945,"I struggle to fathom how this movie is rated as a 7.9 out of 10. To begin with the sound effects are extremely loud and constantly overpowers all words spoken. This is the first time I have ever seen a movie which has such bad sound effects, it really is terribly loud and dialogue gets lost in translation. The next issue is how each scene meshes into another in a scattered manner, with lots of dialogue spoken in each scene and again paired with overpowering sound effects.
Resulting in a confusing cluster muck of a movie which is absolutely dire. I apologise to all 1 star out of 10 rated movies because they do not deserve to be classed in the same category as this shower of excrement."
946,"I love Inception and Interstellar, and I really wanted to love this Nolan film. Alas, I give it a solid ""meh."" There were some fun and interesting moments, to be sure, but the longer the movie went on, the more confusing it became with no real payoff, no resolution, no character development, no heart. It felt a bit like watching someone work on a math problem for 2 hours and 46 minutes--and never getting the answer.I went from trying to understand what was happening, to being frustrated that I didn't understand, to no longer caring that I didn't understand. And, by the way, not only did I not understand what was happening in terms of trying to comprehend the plot, but half the time I couldn't understand the dialogue (and I'm not talking about the backward speech). I kept wishing there were subtitles.Acting was fine, though it often felt a little wooden and I didn't connect with any of the characters. Branagh was the most interesting in an evil, creepy way. But many of his lines (that weren't screamed) were delivered in a mumbled, monotone half-whisper that was difficult to understand. Guess I'll find out what everybody was saying in a few months when I can stream it with subtitles.Music: I miss Hans Zimmer, whose music is interesting in its own right as it helps build tension within the film. This score was not especially memorable. Seems like Nolan tried to make up for lack of plot and character development by making the sound track louder.Another Inception this is not. Nolan is no idiot, but Tenet certainly appears to be full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."
947,"Saw this at the Everyman in Liverpool today and boy was I disappointed! Generic story line, with an unbelievable love tryst between a 7 foot woman and a wee James Bond wannabe! I literally couldn't care less what happened to whom in the end. This is certainly no Momento, Dunkirk or Inception. Don't waste your money!"
948,"Christopher Nolan has been very hit or miss with me lately, and Tenet was very close to being on the negative side. I appreciated some of the action sequences and stunt work that was done in the film. However, the story didn't really grab me as much as I had initially hoped and I didn't feel I got an emotional connection
with any of the characters. Honestly, I was scratching my head on how the reverse/inverse gimmick sort of worked and wasn't 100% sure it all made
sense or Nolan was full of himself. Maybe I'm an idiot I have no idea, but man I was confused with all the sudden location and time changes and what the hell
most of the characters were supposed to be doing. Inception was very straightforward and cleanly structured compared to this.The acting for the most part is pretty solid, but no one really blew me away or made me go I'll remember that character's name or anything. I also
felt it was kind of sloppily edited? Like some shots didn't clearly show what was going on and it felt a bit rushed I guess? Don't get me wrong the film
still has some solid cinematography and set-pieces, but it's not all very consistent in this film. There were twists and turns that could easily be guessed as well, but I don't feel the payoff is really justified. It really feels like a messy Inception/James Bond hybrid with Time Travel the more I sit to think about it.I also noticed the sound mixing was quite bad in places. There were a few scenes where you couldn't hear what the characters were saying because the music was so loud. I initially thought it was just my cinema screening, but nope other people have reported it as well on the Internet, and it's a big problem because some of that dialogue is explaining crucial information about the story and the reverse/inverse gimmick. I shouldn't have to require putting subtitles on for an English speaking film just to hear what they are bloody saying normally! I also felt like I was missing Hans Zimmer's score and the replacement guy doing this one didn't give us anything nearly as memorable in terms of music.So yeah, Tenet is a major letdown considering it was one of the most hyped films of 2020. Maybe I'm just getting sick of Christopher Nolan at this point trying to tell
gimmicky story-lines that may or may not make sense at all. It's certainly not the worst thing ever, but I was really hoping this would be his major comeback and sadly I think the decline is there and see this as one of his weakest movies.5.5/10"
949,"I remember watching inception the first time and didn't like it all. didnt even watch the complete movie....Some time later I watched it again and it s now one of my favourite movies. Now after watching this for 20 min I started wondering who directed this movie ...
Agreed, there are some great action scenes and i always like movies that try something different. I even liked the acting alot, but all in all I had this feeling ""dont give the viewer any info at start and then we can mix it all up..do some twist in the end (not really cos even watching with half an eye i cud predict everything that happened) and then make it look like this great timeline. I also lacked any connection with the characters and i didnt even feel bad the world as we know it was coming to end....Partly because they dont tell u anything in the beginning...who is who, why are they doing wat they do and so on....? On top of that the hand to hand combat scenes didnt really feel like people was fighting...more like they were doing some kind of weird dance...yeah sure it fits the story, but whats a fight without fighting??
In the end i felt like it possibly was a 5hr movie that had to be cut to fit 2.5 and maybe things were lost.
Not my favourite...but who knows, maybe ill watch it again later, dont overthink it and find it one of the best movies ever?
My wife enjoyed it very much :)"
950,You know what you're walking into when Christopher Nolan makes a movie. Mind blowing! I don't want to write anything else because I might spoil it even if I go for another sentence.
951,This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen ..
952,Thats it. A movie that makes absolute no sense. A waste of time. What really strikes me is that this movie has been directed by Christopher Nolan.
953,"Wow what a film. It's a sort of Back to the Future for adults, way far more complex and intricate.But the movie the actors the soundtrack the techniques used are AWESOMESo why not 10? Well, not easy to digest the whole plot, I'll view it again and change the score if I love more."
954,"Finally after months back to the cinema and going in blind in this hyped flick I just didn't know what it was all about. And once it was over my daughter looked at me and I looked back both saying, did you understood it all.That said it must say a lot about this flick. In the beginning it's all understandable espescially the beginning but after the main titles this get explained and if you blink your eyes too much you will never understand it all.Still, we agreed that it will need a second watch to get it but the effects used are stunning. Story is also way above mediocre as did the acting.The last half hour the grand finally it's a bit easier to get it with the coloured scarves but still. It's not one to watch if you need a no-brainer.Together with it's score it elevates this one to a flick well noticed for Oscar nomination, read my lips and no, I didn't did any time travelling
Gore 0/5
Nudity 0/5
Effects 5/5
Story 4/5
Comedy 0/5"
955,"Concept was already difficult to comprehend and the muffled audio only made it harder. But, from what I gather, this time travel doesn't take the butterfly effect into consideration. It would only complicate history, especially if duplicate persons are created and permanently exist."
956,"Very disappointed. There is no real plot, the nature of the threat is so confusing (inverted...). Most dialogues are difficult to understand because of the background noises or poor sound engineers. Music (if we can call this music) is too loud. It is unnecessarily aggressive.
Then there is a succession of scenes with lots of actions but little ""humanity"", it is very cold.
Why is the protagonist ready to prioritise the lady and her son against the rest of humanity? They don't even look in love.
Then the last ""finale"" where 2 teams shoot in all directions but against who? Bullets everywhere but no casualties, no injuries, no deaths.
Nolan wants to compete against James Bond but he missed the pleasure, the sensuality, the humour, and some kind of rational scenario...Honestly, I should have stayed home on my sofa..."
957,"As usual Nolan made it
A mind blowing piece of art
A must watch"
958,"Nolan's experimentation of time in all of his films is fantastic but this one went too far to trying to look ingenious. It ends up being nonsense disguised as something intelligent.Nolan pushed the boundaries of sci-fi into fantasy in Inception, and it mostly worked, but this one is more fantasy then sci-fi. You will have to suspend belief the size of a mountain to be entertained. Apparently just willing an object that is reversed, such as a bullet, will make it work in reverse, huh? It's also explained in the film that the heat from an explosion will have the reverse effect on a person travelling backward in time (i.e. being frozen instead of burned) but this should mean the reverse laws of thermodynamics would apply in all other manners as well, even just a warm day should felt as a cold day, etc. The parts where people are travelling backward in time also don't seem to make sense but it is difficult to decipher what is actually going on most of the time.The two leads execute several fantastic plans that seem impossible without a lot of time and resources, but somehow you're supposed to just accept that they are these exceptional spies without ever getting any details, including character development or backstory.Most of the production is fantastic though, especially terms of the cinematography and the color palette of the film.By the way, don't expect much humor, there was only one part where I heard anyone in the theater laugh.The audio was also extremely poor, I had to strain myself to hear most of the dialog."
959,"What he does, is it possible he same as always. Going rampage confused, lead audience blank (which many likes) and lose all hope for finding a red thread in his ""story"" mixed up with a 45 min too long running time, there is place to sleep a lot without missing a thing.
Better watched home where one can pause and get a beer every time it gets too stupid."
960,"The end of time, the world and Nolan.
I wanted so much to like this film. Huge fan of dark knight inception and interstellar (may be my favourite film of all time). Unfortunately though I was riveted throughout (mainly because I was trying to figure out what was going on) the film was so confusing especially the ending that overall I think it's a dud and very unsatisfying. Maybe I should have watched it in reverse (would have made as much sense). Time to give up this technique Chris!
Also technically while visually spectacular the sound quality was awful and it was very difficult to hear conversations which added to the confusion (mainly due to masks and the score which was inappropriate at times). Do they not test these films with real audiences prior to release? What about subtitles (and an explanation of the film) Chris? Maybe they want you to see the film several times to figure out what's going on. Can't take the risk in case I walk out confused a second time. The arty types will pretend they understand (just to make the people who don't feel stupid. Look to the 10 star reviews😅). Difficult to understand where they spent the $200m! Won't be holding my breath for Nolan's next film The end of Nolan!!"
961,"A lot of people were saying the music was too loud and they couldn't hear the dialogue, but I didn't have issues at all. My mind was absolutely blown and there is no simple way to explain the movie. You really have to see it for yourself, preferably twice to understand it better. I really enjoyed it and I can say it's up there with Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight. I'm not good at reviewing but it's absolutely f*cking awesome. He did it again. In a couple of years it will go down as a classic. 10/10"
962,Im giving this a 5 until i can watch it again to try and figure out what actually happened. Difficult to hear what they're saying with masks on and combine that with the super confusing story makes for a pretty incomprehensible movie. Will be much better on DVD so you can rewind and/or turn subtitles on.
963,"The movie has nothing to tell. The entire inverted thing it's just the way to move a ""story"" around.
Even the actors had to explain what was happening on the screen during the movie. When this happen chances are that your story doesn't work.
I liked the music, but sfx have some problems, because it's really difficult to hear actors voices.
This movie is a confirmation that ""we live in a twilight world""."
964,"Just seen this at the cinema, firstly the sound editing is awful, the sound fx is too loud and dialogue too quiet.
There is far too much dialogue for anyone to take in, and I noticed it gave little chance for the actors to say any of it with any actual meaning and emotion as they seemed in a hurry to spit it all out.
Many people have said second time you pick up all the clues, this is because you can't take in all the dialogue first time but why would I want to watch it again after not enjoying the film, I'm sure you can understand most complicated films after multiple watches but you should at least grasp the majority of the concept first time to not feel you have just wasted your time.
I am usually good at getting my head round a film but wasn't sure what they were trying to achieve in most scenes.
Give it a miss, this is only for the fans of the director who will rewatch and analyse, for the average viewer your wasting your time."
965,"I waited a couple of days before adding the review just in case it was our local cinema. But no, I've read many similar comments. Right from the beginning, the dialogue was hard to understand especially in the early scenes where I couldn't understand a word spoken by Washington wearing his helmet. Actually, I thought that it could have been deliberate but throughout the film I kept shrugging my shoulders wondering what had been said. The film was confusing enough with some great ideas and visuals. Branagh and Pattinson were great which boosted by rating to 5. Otherwise 3."
966,"This is Nolan's biggest achievement. His loudest, most ambitious and divorced from reality. A nice visual spectacle, with pleasant but overblown soundtrack by Ludwid Göransson, Tenet makes the mistake of many contemporary titles in the time travel genre - it gets to the details of it. And the further a movie delves into the logistics of a scientifically impossible or unproven phenomenons, the duller it gets.
So, what Tenet ends up being is one predictable, poorly planned and lacking in inspirational fantasy excuse for loud fights and explosions. There is a point of detail beyond which a movie is no longer entertaining, just like how a map that has too many signs becomes useless. And so, the only interesting conclusion I can draw from this production is that if you travel back in time, you first see the products of your bowel movement and you then have to stop and suck it back in for your organism to function properly.
In light of this conclusion, screenwriters need to be careful about the implications of their work. If you allow your ideas to spread in this kind of directions, you've done a bad job at suspending disbelief and entertaining. So, for a movie all about cause and effect, and thinking more carefully, Tenet really asks the viewer to think less and enjoy the pretty pictures on the screen. How's that for a paradox, I'd ask Nolan."
967,One of the worst film I had ever seen. Doesn't worth spending time and money. Form my perspective sure.
968,"Tenet - A- (Almost Perfect)Another winner for Christopher Nolan as movie is ambitious with mind bending concept of time aversion. The movie kept you on edge of your seat even though the concept and motives of the protagonist are confusing and it needs lots of explanation than Interstellar or Inception.I reckon, people will dissect the concept in years to come as me myself have to watch multiple YouTube to understand the time aversion and time travel in it. Nonetheless, it is highly entertaining and has solid performances by John David Washington, Robert Pattison, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Debicki. This is all and all Nolan's show, the actors are part of his universe but doesn't steal the show. Elizabeth Debicki is the only humanised character to which you can relate to but others especially leads their motives and personalities are never fully explored. Matthew had his daughter in Interstellar and Leo had his wife but in Tenet we do not have anything emotional for the protagonist to cling on too so when the movie ends you feel nothing for character as his relationship with Elizabeth Debicki is nothing more than a saviour or a mission. Robert Pattison's Neil has the most interesting character but all covered in mystery. The connecting dots between Elizabeth Debicki's son Max and Neil makes him the hidden gem in Tenet.Highly recommended for people looking for original concept and tiered of sequels and remakes. I do wish movie was less confusing and took time to explain it's time aversion theory and people didn't have to go online to understand the concept."
969,"I think that giving this movie 5 stars is generous. I will not mention horrible audio edit done on this movie as you can read about it in almost every other review (clue: too loud. My head was pounding. The score VERY loud while dialogues were on a quiet side).The movie was slow, in spite of very fast action sequences (seems like a paradox but it's true). You know when movie is bad when you start nervously looking at your watch counting minutes to the end of the movie. 150 minutes - WAY too long.To be frank, I am not sure how this movie could be fixed as it was very hard to follow. I think that with ""Tenet"", Nolan jumped the shark."
970,"As a self--proclaimed Nolanogist, Nolan is one of the greats to me. Almost every of his films is a masterpiece to me (there are only a few exceptions.. coughs.. Dunkirk and Quay are awful..). Tenet looked very enticing. Nolan tackling time--travel after all. Only he calls it something else, time inversion. (More on that later.) Given the current circumstances, the film was proclaimed as the savior of the cinema industry. So nothing major. Just the first big film event after months of nothing, of this dry season. It slowly became the film to save the universe, the film to save the film industry. It became synonymous with the word 'hype'. If you were to look in a dictionary and find 'hype' there, it would give you the definition and underneath there would be a picture of the Tenet poster.
Christopher Nolan has been accused of making films too convoluted for their own sake, and perhaps the biggest criticism of them all, would be that he makes films without emotion. Hollow at the core. I always disagreed with this statement, however Tenet is that very film that critics accused him of making the whole time. Only this time it is true. Tenet is a bland nothing of a film.Tenet starts out in media res (in a similar fashion to a James Bond film), at an extraction mission of sorts that goes awry. So awry that it ends in torture, and our main nameless character (sometimes referred to as The Protagonist, i.e. John David Washington) biting on a cyanide capsule. Only he wakes up afterwards, not dead, only to find out he has been recruited into an even more covert agency than he was at before. This one cares about saving the world from what could happen. He is given a word and a gesture to help him. That is all. During the opening mission he encounters the casing of a bullet, going backwards from one of the seats. He is then tasked to find this inverted ammo. And its origin.
In order to get to a meeting with an arms dealer, The Protagonist meets the affable and dapper Neil (Robert Pattinson), which further leads them to Andrei Sator (Kenneth Brannagh who speaks in an dastardly diction and fashion, using threats about cutting someone's balls and stuffing them down someone's throat). The only way to get to Sator and find out his motives and plans is through his abused and exploited wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki).
The film spends its better half filling the story with action scenes of great scope (opera houses being blown up, bungee jumping on a building, airplanes crashing into hangars, a boating trip gone wrong) yet despite all this, it is not particularly engaging. There are no real stakes presented, the lead actor is strangely emoting nothing. Not in a cool, suave way. Just no emotions. Pattinson tries his hardest to be the likable core of the film, only his character is not presented to us in any way. Neil just drops in to see what condition the state of the world is, and it is obvious he knows a little more than the rookie Protagonist. Those two leads are just one--dimensional figures. There is no reason given to care or root for them.Elizabeth Debicki as Kat continues Nolan's Dead Wife trope, only to give it a little twist this time. Brannagh is really delightful as the bit over--the--top villain, only again, his character doesn't offer much nor creates any real stakes, only posing a threat over the life of Kat, who ends up being a pawn in the game of these men: Sator, the husband she loathes but stays with because of their son, and the nameless agent, who exploits her for his own gains.
The stakes are never really quite established---only as something worse than armageddon. Later on we hear Branagh's plan and it isn't that enticing. The fact that the film doesn't try to make the audience care about any of the characters makes any world--ending stakes utterly meaningless. Sator is after The Algorithm, a glorified MacGuffin that is described, acts like and looks like the AllSpark cube from the Transformers franchise.
Nolan knows how to spend the studio's money. No doubt about it. The film is big and doesn't shy away from big scope and spectacle. Only the film does this at the expense of the story. Nolan is masterful at using practical effects. The airplane crash scene is practical effects galore. Only that it is absolutely nonsensical. An airplane crashes and blows up, just because Nolan wanted it to be so. The characters are staging a heist and then one of them has an idea to just ram a plane into the airport. Now ain't that a new heist concept?
This is a bad noisy blockbuster that tries to imitate the scope and grandeur of Michael Bay. (I am a Michael Bay fan.) The James Bond, Bay, and Mission: Impossible influences are obviously there, but the action scenes lack the emotional punch or tension. It all ends up as an empty shell of a film that just tries to be as good as those mentioned above. Tenet has got nothing on the scope and the grandeur of the last M:I installment. At some points it feels as if watching a parody of a Christopher Nolan film. The film cares too much about staging these elaborate cool, generic action scenes but forgets any story or characters. To further emphasize the generic nature of the action, the film's climax features a lot of gunfire and military--clad figures.
The use of practical effects is nice but if they don't serve any story, they just end up as an interesting tidbit the PR team can use in a featurette or people in a pub can discuss how cool it is that the actors actually did that stunt on set.
The film is a time travel story. No matter what Nolan says. It is a different time travel than usually featured in films, yes, but time travel nevertheless. Nolan is just using his old tricks here and since it is a time travel film, most of those tricks are easy to figure out. During a retelling of an event in the film Kat spots a mystery woman jumping from Sator's yacht. Who could it be? Of course, only her time travelling/inverted herself. A mystery assailant attacks The Protagonist and is moving in reverse? Of course, it is himself time travelling/inverted (that scene pales in comparison with the Inception hallway fight). If you have seen a time travel sci--fi movie then you can figure these out on your own as quickly as they are set up.
Yes, and now we are getting to time--inversion, which doesn't really come into play until very late in the film. Time inversion really doesn't move the plot forward, it is just a gimmick, a way to reuse some scenes in the film. There is a lot of discussion on the internet about how the film unravels, and people trying to study the mystery. The film offers very little exposition, only that of a scientist who tells The Protagonist: ""Don't try to understand it. Feel it"". That's it.
The exposition you get in the film is the same as in the trailer. Nothing elaborate. Apparently it all works on instinct. And then there is a time travel machine, in this case a turnstile, and it just causes the characters to move backwards in time. Easy. The film is so blatantly vague that it borders on comedy. It is as if the film refuses to tell us some information, denying us the name of the lead character. It is as if asking someone for answers they don't know the answers to.
The film is not confusing as some make it out to be. It is pretty simple in narrative. No jumbled up chronology. What it does is it attempts to look smart and throws some buzzwords or tries to create a sense of confusion through the nonsensical dialogue. At one point the characters just start to talk about the Grandfather Paradox just because they feel like it. The conversation doesn't lead into anything, nor does it have any meaning or reason to be discussed. The Protagonist refers to himself as The Protagonist and the antagonists are referred to as Antagonists. Analyze that as you will.
A lot of people are once again complaining about the sound mix and not being able to understand the characters. Now I am a person who has a hearing aid and loves going to the movies for the mere fact that I don't need to have one in my ear because I can hear it in a cinema. I saw the film with subtitles and also understood everything everyone said in the film. No complaints on the sound mixing from me.
Tenet is simply a disappointment. Nolan is not progressing himself forward, he is moving backwards as fast as the inverted characters of Tenet. Tenet is merely an exercise in style, absent the intricate plotting of Memento and The Prestige. Tenet is in no way the film that saved the world, the universe or the film industry. It's just a big, loud, brainless action blockbuster. That is all. Nothing more.
I hope Nolan returns to something more low--key next time. After the abysmal Dunkirk, now there is Tenet, a disappointing hollow film. I hope next time there will be another Memento, Inception, Interstellar or Insomnia in the cards."
971,"Come on film goers, what do you want from a Nolan movie? 2 separate Guardian critics gave bipolar opposite ratings which says it all. Nolan is marmite - love or loathe. I'm a fan so kiss unconscious bias Goodbye, for I am biased! I want to see the film again and why criticise Nolan for that? Either see it in IMAX or buy it on DVD or see it on Netflix.......which is what film and Nolan addicts do. Rinse and Repeat which is what Tenet is about; albeit you will Repeat and Rinse too!! Get it????!!! So thicko critics out there go away and Nolan lovers or noobs are welcome, for CREATIVITY is what you will get from Nolan; AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN! The"
972,"In this day in age of binge-watching to get to the end as quickly as possible, this story demands being patiently viewed and digested. The attention to so many small details in this movie is simply amazing and fully grasping them will probably require a second (or more) viewing. I will also warn viewers that MANY theaters nowadays struggle to properly mix sound and this movie is intended to have loud jarring moments that bad sound mixing will make brutal on the ears. I would say avoid watching this in an RPX or IMAX (the fake mini ones like AMC) as those tend to be some of the worst ones for thinking louder is the purpose of good speakers.The story of the film bends, weaves, and folds over itself in a spectacular fashion that will appeal to those of us who enjoyed reading ""A Wrinkle in Time"" as kids. Nolan will slow things down and zoom in the camera to call our attention to important details, but you're not supposed to know WHY they're important for awhile. Just be sure to file them in your memory bank and know most of them will have more than one reveal. The whole movie is peeling through layers, but not just to get to what's under them. Instead, it's like finding out you can put the layers back TOGETHER to form a treasure.If you enjoyed the movie ""Momento,"" you'll really enjoy this film. Don't try to solve it too quickly because that may lead to missing many of the hints that are right in front of you. Enjoy the action and deception, while you take it all in. This movie was clearly written to allow for something new on each re-watching and will most likely require at least two viewings."
973,"Let's be honest. The audio in this movie wasn't even that hard to hear.""Tenet,"" or as most movie goers in America like to call it, ""Tenant,"" is the newest Christopher Nolan mind-bending action thriller. No doubt being compared to ""Inception,"" ""Tenet"" is a somehow more confusing, but equally as riveting film. With intense action, good acting throughout, and a compellingly interesting story, this is a movie that is worth risking COVID for.I've heard a lot of mixed things about ""Tenet"" before I risked death to watch it in theatres. I heard that it was overly long and lacking in character development. I heard that it was too confusing and harder to follow than Nolan's previous works. I heard that the audio was incomprehensible. But I also heard that it was filled to the brim with gorgeous visuals, a euphoric score, and compelling performances. And all of those things are true.The newest Nolan film is by no means the saviour of cinema that so many wanted it to be. However, it is incredibly good. In terms of action, ""Tenet"" has to be one of the most thrilling movies in years. My heart was pounding as hard and as fast as the drums that accompanied the action sequences. With zero shaky-cam, and almost everything filmed practically in-camera, it's impossible to say that this is a bad movie because of how good the violence was filmed. From an absolutely breathtaking hostage situation and shootout in an opera house to a high-stakes robbery that culminates in the very real explosion of an airplane (no CGI to be found there), the sheer amount of set pieces makes this movie, at the least entertaining and watchable. For me, that made up for the lack of relatable characters.It's true; ""Tenet"" has characters that are kept at arm's length, most definitely purposefully. But while the audience may never get to fully comprehend the complexities of each and every character, Nolan gives us enough to understand the motivations and follow the story, and the movie takes off from there. To me, that wasn't a bad thing. This film is based off its spectacle, and when you know that going in, you'll enjoy it in spades. But, I would be amiss if I didn't mention the infamous audio issues that so many others have criticized the movie for.Yes, there are points in the film where the background noise slightly drowns out the dialogue. This can make the already convoluted story even more difficult to follow. However, there was never a point in the movie where I could not understand the dialogue, so for me personally, I cannot mark this as a negative. What is a negative? As I mentioned, the overly convoluted story. I don't mind confusing storylines, but ""Tenet"" seems to take it a step too far, almost reveling in telling a story that it knows the audience will not be able to understand, at least not on the first viewing. However, for all of you fans of cerebral movie experiences, ""Tenet"" will no doubt satisfy.""Tenet"" may not be the most emotionally resonant movie of 2020, but what it lacks in emotion it makes up for in pure thrills. Think of this one as Nolan's 007. It works as an action thriller, as a science fiction movie, as a drama, and as a piece of cerebral filmmaking; I only wish its story was as comprehensive as its set pieces.8/10"

975,"Note: Needs at least two attempts to be understood properly, it deserves a review only when completely understood.This movie is Nolan's best work till date. We usually see him either play with narrative structure to make a puzzle out of the time line (memento for example), or we see him play around with the concept of time and space in someway (Inception, Interstellar). But here we get the best of both worlds, although making the story a bit too complex to understand but a second watch will surely blow your mind. This movie is too goof even for Nolan's standards.I believe this won't get a higher ever because mostly people won't bother to pay for watching the same movie multiple times, hence it will mostly be under-understood.But I do recommend this one, exactly what we needed after a long break from movie theaters. Some dialogues aren't clear enough to understand because of the way they are delivered or sometimes suppressed by environmental sounds. Other than that this one is a solid 10/10.Both the protagonists (since John David Washington is 'A Protagonist') did a great job and inversed action sequences are huge directorial and cerographical achievements."
976,"This movie is unbelievably good, It's incredibly complex and over all just mesmerizing, the action sequences are mind blowing, I just can't get how there are people hating on this, maybe not the best Nolan's project but such a masterpiece without a doubt. You can't score this movie if you has only seen it once. It's just impossible, in the second time you'll get a lot of references and details that probably you have missed the first time. The whole soundtrack is powerful and the performances are on point. I'm still on shock and I guess I will like it even more as I watch it again."
977,"It just wasn't entertaining. Some of the dialogue was hard to hear an understand. Performances were good. Honestly, it had the feel of a Bond pic with time travel at the center: The Protagonist's gray suit; Bond name of one of the characters. If Christopher Nolan wants to make a Bond film I'm sure they could make a deal. Wait for home video on this one so you can rewind it to understand some of the bits. Bond in November should be way better...and entertaining."
978,"Not that it would have made the film much more coherent. A pseudo-intellectual, ear-piercing, right-on, and overall insipid exercise in ""cool"" that comprises most of what's wrong with modern Hollywood. Nolan is clearly a talented director, but he (quite literally) lost the plot with this one."
979,"This was too long, very confusing and too many plots."
980,"Plot is way to involved, and not even good. Background noise too loud, many people complained that you cant hear the cast. Not even CLOSE to a 7, I gave it a 4."
981,Just watched it for the first time. Great movie for those of us who enjoy an intelligent and challenging movie. Beautifully written and directed. Definitely one of my favorite movies. Possibly my favorite. Hard to tell before my 2nd watch
982,"Tenet is a sci-fi spy thriller directed by Cristopher Nolan (Memento, Inception). As usual, his film came with a lot of anticipation and then noise about more divided opinions. The action of the film sends us into a spy game, where understanding and combining events from different timelines is key to saving the world. Nolan has already shown many times that time is his favorite toy and Tenet is a film where he wanted to take it to incredible limits.However, this has created some problems. The first of them is that Nolane's ideas require knowledge of the laws of physics, so the characters explain them directly to each other, which is not the most interesting or understandable.
The other big problem lies in characterization of the characters, which, with the absence of real motivation of the Protagonist, leads to that when the action starts to get complicated, we simply don't care enough to catch everything.
The third problem is that we're used to Nolan being technically perfect and everything sounds and looks perfect, but that wasn't the case here. Maybe it's a slightly more confusing montage or that the boomerang effect just doesn't matter to us as much as Nolan thought it would be.On the plus side, there were occasional good moments and Robert Pattinson once again proved that he forgot about vampire days and grew into a very serious actor. It seems to me that this film will be better and clearer after you watch it a few times, but the problem is that I just don't have the desire to do it. Anyway, I recommend that you watch this movie, maybe your dice will match up slightly better.The impression is that Nolan's been playing. He waited about ten years for things to come into place and to imagine it on the film screen. But that kind of waiting, it can blind a man, and he loses some objective awareness of what's more and less interesting to others. That seems to have been the case somewhat.So, what do you think? Does it live up to the hype?"
983,Good movie but hard to analyzenabsjzhshshhshshshshshshshshshshhshshshshs
984,You need to re-watch it but this movie is really really good. No worries it all makes sence after the second time you watch it.
985,"Tenet is an average, boring, confusing mess of a movie. Poor sound, sloppy editing and clumsy exposition that tries but fails to explain away the pointless plot gimmick (reverse entropy) that seems cool for all of ten seconds, and then you're left asking why?Of all the 10/10 reviews I've read, not one person can explain why shooting someone in reverse has any greater benefit than just shooting them? This would surely require someone to predict the future, spray the scene with bullets, so they can 'catch' them with the gun. What?And what benefit did sending two armies in - one going backwards and one forwards? Maybe it was explained in all of the dialogue I couldn't hear?Making things deliberately incoherent does not make it clever.Having to watch and dissect a film more than once does not make you smarter than everyone who thought this film sucked after one viewing.If you think this film is a masterpiece then your bar really must be low.Memento is a masterpiece. Inception is brilliant. The Prestige is a great film. This, however, is a massive turkey."
986,"I could go on all day about how the story was confusing, lacked fluidity and has plot holes but the biggest two gripes for me were the acting and action sequences.
I was expecting something much more spectacular from the action scenes but they were pretty underwhelming and tried to overcompensate with the soundtrack.
As for the acting I found Washington quite wooden and lacked any emotion at all, even when certain scenes warranted it. Pattinson's accent changes throughout the film, sounding like an oxford schoolboy one minute then a fake American accent next. Same goes for Taylor-Johnson, who switched between some sort of U.K. accent, American and Australian, sometimes during the same sentence.
Too much thought went into trying to explain the over complicated storyline compared to focusing on the acting."
987,"I didn't liked this Tschernobyl Fallout styled time flipping movie called Tenet. Few times it feels as if Nolan overdozed on acid and watched the matrix triology bit too often. There are a few nice action scenes and Nolan tried to get scientific time travelling ala Einstein into a hollywood blockbuster and failed because nobody of the intelligent anti-popcorn fraction (that he clearly wanted to reach out) is interested in such confusing stuff, that is just a big complicated construct of timezones. I won't watch it again. I was able to follow and check it at first time. No thanks! There is missing heart and soul behind all this tech. The worst part is that he mixes all kind of movies together: Mission Impossible, Bad Boys, Matrix, James Bond, Jumper, James Ryan and a bit of Batman. No, sorry this one is far away from a brilliant unique movie gem."
988,"After years of watching Nolan films, and being a big fan, the anticipation of this film was increased by the delay to its release. Finally I was able to sit and watch it, in an empty cinema, and I have to say it was a total and utter flop for me.The film feels like a series of confusing and chaotic set pieces, muddled together; entwined with a god awful din of a soundtrack. Nestled amongst these set pieces are a group of characters who just dont inspire any sort of feeling or emotion. 2/3 of the way through, I didnt really care what happened to any of them. And actually, you start to think, any of them could die, and they just rewind time and do it again. And when they do, it would be greeted with a massive fog horn that bellows out so you dont understand a word anyway.The viewer is thrown into a world with no explanation, no back stories or emotional involvement. Just instant booming, muttering and over editing. The story is simple, it centre's around a lover scorned, who wants to end the world so no one else can touch his wife. Our heroes scramble around, going back and forth in time to try and stop him collecting the final infinity stone, oh sorry, wrong film. But similar premises.I think maybe its just that i didnt connect. Fair play to Nolan as usual for not conforming to the norm, but it just feels like a film trying to be overly complicated for the sake of it.I spoke to the attendant on the way out and he asked if I enjoyed it. I said no, and that it was so disappointing. He suggested I watch it again as apparently its ""better the second time"". I think I will pass on that one."
989,Such a complex movie .. dont judge from the first time .. watch the movie at least 5 times to understand it ..The protagonist is the inversion of Niel .. and vice versa ...Infinite loop of choices that will determine the fate of the human race ..Remember .. dont think .. just feel it ..Amazing ginzamA
990,"It's normal to need to watch Nolan's films multiple times to appreciate the layers and sometimes to fully understand what's going on.This time though it'll take three or four watches just to understand the dialogue.With Tenet, he's turned up the levels for his renowned 'BWOOOOOOOOOOM' bass lines to a Spinal Tap 11. The cinema shakes. Meanwhile not only is the sound mix dropping the speech to about half what it needs to be while that's going on, but Branagh is actually angrily whispering.Cinema can transport you into the life of another human being. If you watch Tenet you'll be transported into the life of someone who's hard of hearing and suffering general confusion due to mental decline.It's much worse if you watch on a screen with a powerful sound system. So contrary to the usual advice, do not watch this film on IMAX. Try to find the weakest, tinniest sound system in town. Even better, wait until it's online with subtitles.My favourite part? About 90 minutes in, one of the characters sparks in Russian. Nolan helpfully adds subtitles. I found myself hoping much of the rest of the film would be in Russian. I was disappointed.SPOILER ALERT...
There's another issue with the central conceit.You'll have a nagging feeling throughout about this but might find it hard to pinpoint.But of you think about it you'll realise that you never really see the consequence of actions made in reverse.If someone going backwards through time shoots a helicopter out of the sky, for example.. in the 'normal' forward timeline, this would mean the characters in that helicopter starting off dead (or frozen) on the ground, before being sucked back up into the sky in flames in a reverse explosion (not sure this would actually be an implosion), and then going about their day. They start off dead then come back to life. How do you start your day off dead? What were you doing before that?Anyway this isn't a deal breaker.. I guess it could be counted as the one conceit you forgive a film.But overall it's a huge shame that the film is almost a parody of the Nolan fingerprint, particularly the sound mix and overblown score. Otherwise it's got lots of typically smart ideas."
991,"If you enjoying watching pointless confusing conversation covered in a terrible soundtrack with a frustratingly bad audio mix AND you love action with cool visual effects, then you will love this movie! I truly hated it. A thoroughly unenjoyable mind bending mess. I feel assaulted. No story, no explanation and poor casting. See it at your peril. Take aspirin (or stronger with you). The 3 stars is for the effects people."
992,"What seems to be an intelligent, thought through and original plot soon shows to be blowing up in its own face. Whereas Nolan usually offers the viewer a guiding light through his ever confusing films, Tenet seems to leave even the most attentive viewer losing the red lining. For example: in Inception the rules of travelling between different dimensions are thoroughly described and displayed. Tenet leaves the explanation of its mysteries to the last few minutes of the over 2,5h movie, and even then it doesn't feel totally fulfilling. There's many, many plot holes. The entire diegesis and its rules raise so many questions that the story loses its reliability and plot progress points lose their worth. Even when there are events that are putting some of the many puzzle pieces together it quickly gets followed up by some more confusing and chaotic scenes. Zero time is offered to overthink and process the information that lies outside the normative understanding of the human mind. It's a shame, really. On paper this plot could really work, but Nolan's execution in my opinion absolutely disappointed.The editing also disappointed me greatly. Most dialogue, which mostly isn't written very well either, uses way to many cuts back and forth the characters. Moreover, the jump cuts that are used sometimes seems off. It's like Nolan's in a rush, but for what? This only enforces the confusing character this film already has.Tenet earned its 4 stars because it does use stunning special effects and cgi. The production team an post-production did do a good job, and the soundtrack seems to be very fitting. If the sound editing would've been done better I would reward the movie with 5 stars (the music and sound effects were too loud and dialogue sounds like mumbling). But a higher rating could only have been if Nolan hadn't out-Nolaned himself."
993,"More multi layered and complex than any other Nolan movie, visually stunning and impeccably acted. Experimentalism joins crowd pleasing, is't this true craftsmanship ?Watched a second time in one week, I became an ""inverted"" spectator traveling back in time from the known end. All pieces fall into place and the feeling is unique. This is pure genius and deserves a full rate.And, I found all the words of the Arepo Square, can anyone still think it is a coincidence ?"
994,This is just me and this is my first comments on a film. Even on IMAX this film didn't do it for me. Dialogue bores me. Actors bores me. Sound effects is good on IMAX. Visual effects also good. Story bores me and it was presented on a boring manner. It can be better prolly if let say another director presents it. I love Nolan's work but this one feels like lacking. But Nolan did one good masterly move I guess. Timely released on cinemas because if there is no pandemic it'll be a big disaster I guess. But I can see many people loved it or trying to love it because of the time concept perception thingy. I hope someday remake this into a better film. I like the concept too bad it didn't work for me.
995,"This was an excellent movie, but to truly understand it, it has to be watched more than once. I watched it and read the plot on Wikipedia afterwards. I'll certainly be watching it again now I understand what is going on. It feels like the movie is all over and nothing is explained, but that's not the case, it's just an extremely complex movie that is also extremely hard to understand upon the first viewing"
996,"Interesting to watch cinematically just for the effects but is not something I would recommend nor would I watch it again.The Opera scene was a strong start but the only other highlights were the effects - not the story, not the character development.The film had decent acting throughout, but overall, this feels like a concept piece with a weak story written around it.Yet another cerebral film from Nolan that attempts to convince us he's brainy."
997,"I'm a big Nolan fan, and have seen all his films at least 3 times each. If someone told me this movie was made by a wanna-be Nolan newbie director, i'd have believed.
First the positives - the cinematography and colors were excellent. There is a certain grandeur to the film, that makes you realize this is in fact a big budget film.
And, of course the mind-bending inversion concept, kinda takes the sci-fi bread/butter theme, time-travel, to a new level. This was refreshing.
The negatives - Music was just annoying, to say the least. Unnecessarily loud, and distracting. I really think the matured compositions of Zimmer would have made the viewing much palatable than it is now. Casting and acting were meh. Anyone else could have acted here. It doesn't matter. The characters were all one-dimensional, giving them hardly any room for ""acting"". Nothing special about the lines and dialogues, they were very rudimentary. Other than the prior knowledge that i was watching a film made by Christopher Nolan i had nothing else going for me. I just wasn't invested in the story, even though the inversion concept blew my mind, with the entropy and what-not. It would have helped to understand the complications of this better, we needed someone like DiCaprio talking us through the various levels of this mind-bending mess. Overall- the movie completely lacks emotion, and soul, for the lack of a better word.A movie, at the basic level, should be made to entertain. Tenet failed me here. And, although plenty confusing, does not make me want to discuss and talk about it with everyone (like Inception and Interstellar made me).5/10"
998,This is nothing new. It has been done before. Generic time heist movie with stupid villain. Too much complexity ads tons of plot holes. Like where did the good guys get anothern time machine? Or how could team red and blue be in same place without oxygen masks? It was so predictable when the story kicked in. The music was also terrible.
999,"A confusing, time warping mess. Within 10 minutes I hadn't got a clue what was going on, was irritated by the intrusive soundtrack and lacked any emotional attachment to any of the characters. Michael Caine gave us his amused sardonic turn and Robert Pattinson was quite engaging at times, but on the whole I just didn't care. For some reason it also made me feel sick during the last 45 minutes. I was irritated, uncomfortable and nauseous by the end. A long awaited disappointment."
1000,Nothing will prepare you for the might of story-telling and action in this movie. Simply an amazing showing of how Nolan can tell an amazing story while still having a water-tight plot.
1001,Just one big mess ok the music was good but you feel it was to cover the problems with a confused story.
1002,"This movie was just all special effects and no plot and no acting ability.
Also, i couldn't hear the dialogue as it was recorded badly. Needs subtitles.
Really a waste of money"
1003,"Memento, The Prestige, Inception and Interstellar had something in common (besides being Christopher Nolan movies), they demanded and appreciated an attentive audience, paying attention to every second on the screen and they rewarded multiple viewings with added detail and hidden puzzle pieces.Tenet differs from those great movies in one regard, it doesn't try to bring an engaged audience along, it tries to outsmart it in a way that comes of slightly arrogant. It doesn't only reward multiple viewings it requires them. And this I have to hold against the movie.Cinematography, acting, soundtrack and set pieces are all spectacular, as expected, the sound-mix on the other hand is following Interstellar in that the voices are relatively muted against the soundtrack and the soundscape. This movie is 100% plot driven and it is essential to listen to every word said, but often the movie makes it intentionally hard to understand the characters. There is a scene with 3 people sailing on boat while negotiating a deal, I did not understand a word that was said there. There is also a major turn in the story midway to the movie where the protagonist has to make a tough decision under pressure and a lot of new characters appear arguing for and against the next cause of action. This scene contains significant amounts of information on how this world works, yet it is incredibly hard to follow since people are talking over each other and it is not even clear on who is talking all the time.I walked out of the theater unsatisfied, while I think I got most of it, there is a major plot point that doesn't make sense to me. Yes, a lot of people say it's better on second viewing and I will watch it again when it hits VOD one day, but not in theaters (especially during pandemic) and maybe it will be better. The way it stands it comes of as disrespectful for the audience."
1004,"The worst thing that can happen in a movie or book is the story not touching you. Emotionally, Tenet was like eating spoiled seafood, we know it's the best thing ever, but we vomit after eating it.
The characters are very disappointing, they are so insignificant and the main character is the worst part of the movie. It's like destroying the famous movie line, ""My name is Bond, James Bond"" and put it like this, ""My name is James Bond"" it destroys everything, its image, its dignity, its perfection. Nolan has a very wonderful feature, Nolan has the power and imagination to put the characters telling their own story, sometimes even the story of the movie. And that its incredible. But when the character tells everything about the film, all the details, as if the character doesn't understand anything about the film, what is going on, unfortunately destroys the film and reduces the artwork to a spoiled oyster. Unfortunately the movie is bad, it blind us with special effects. Transforms the complex into incomprehensible. Definitely worth watching."
1005,"There's no backstory. None. You get thrown through all those action scenes patched together with lousy dialogues. You feel like you've skipped 5 previous episodes in a TV series and now you're watching something that makes no sense to you. Except that you haven't missed anything - it's just really, and I mean REALLY, bad writing coupled with even worse directing.In the beginning you hope there will be some kind of clever and unexpected resolution of at some point the movie. Unfortunately, this hope never materializes - it's impossible to understand and follow what's actually happening on the screen.And then there are the movie characters. While I can applaud the actors' performance for the most part, the characters themselves are unbelievable and terribly underdeveloped. Dialogues, that for the most part are intended to aid the viewer grasp the movie's premise, don't help. They are so laughably unrealistic (""I'm a tiger!""), and so dry, that it seems they were written by a 13 year old.The only thing I'm happy about is that Hans Zimmer was spared of taking part in this major farce."
1006,"I love Nolan. Following, Memento, Inception, Interstellar... I couldn't speak highly enough of those films. But this is a crapfest. It's utter garbage.1) The dialog. It's too scripted-sounding, rapidfire, and doesn't give you time to take it in. Worse is that it's delivered in a monotone devoid of any human emotion. Oh, wait, no, what's even worse than that is that it's mumbled and then there's the loud music overlaid on top of that. I am a native speaker and literally couldn't make out about 60% of the dialogue. Extremely frustrating.2) The entire inversion concept is so stupid you can't get your head around it. It's not ""wow I can't understand this super smart concept"". It's just dumb. Reverse entropy moving forward in time but actually, no, it's backwards but.... yeah, whatever. It's stupid beyond belief. You just can't let yourself get sucked into the story. At least I couldn't.I really wish I had just rewatched Interstellar instead. What a waste of time."
1007,"Nobody acting in this film seems like they're having a good time. I can almost see the fear in their eyes that Nolan is going to yell at them for showing any emotion besides trepidation. The main actor, John David Washington, has zero charisma in this movie. He's portrays a diluted version of a character. Nolan presumably had a say in who was cast for this movie. Once you hire an actor, let them act! Don't try to change them, like a controlling spouse in a toxic relationship.The time-shifting aspect is the selling point, and it's more compelling in the trailer than in the actual movie. During the movie, bland dialog overwhelmed the main sci-fi concept. I wanted things to get better and make more sense, but they never did. In fact, I stopped watching 60% through and figured I'd forget about the movie and move on with my life. I must admit, I was so desperately hoping for a great ending that I fired up the movie again the next day. What a waste of time."
1008,"This must be the ultimate proof that Nolan is extremely over valued.
Story are boring.
Actors are boring.
Sound design is so bad it's hard to hear the campy dialogue over the music.This is exactly how high concept movies should not be. As a viewer you don't care about the actors because they don't generate any excitement or thrills. They are just like robots."
1009,"Honest, I'm a HUGE fan of Christopher Nolan and have pretty much loved all his films. This film on the other hand was so bad i only sat through it because I felt compelled to give it a chance. I have now watched it a second time because I thought I may have misread the whole point of the film but have now come to the conclusion that it simply is not a good film. That's not to say that It's not well filmed. It has very good choreography in scenes and fantastic cinematography etc but it simply falls flat because of how pretentious the storyline is. I wont go into spoilers but the plot holes are huge and the entire concept is totally based in negligible pseudo science. Really a shame as I tried hard to like this film"
1010,"An evil Russian mobster dying of cancer wants to destroy the world by using a sci-fi technology that reverses time for objects and people. Doesn't sound so smart anymore when you sum it up like that, does it?You may disagree with my on my 1/10 rating, because after all not every single last aspect of the movie is bad. The cinematography sure is nice and Robert Pattinson does give a decent performance (the main actor not so much). I recently made a rule that I would deduct up to 5 points if important plot details are lost due to bad audio and/or actors mumbling their lines. This movie straight-up deserves the full 5 point penalty. So... sorry for all the people who legitimately did a good job in this movie and are now not getting credit.Even if the dialogue had been more clear, there are still other audio issues. Let me put it this way: I'm a huge fan of Death Metal and Black Metal. I often sit there with headphones on blasting music for several hours. Yet this movie gave me more of a headache than music ever did. Since this review is marked for spoilers it's too late to tell you now, but next time you're gonna watch a Nolan movie you better bring ear plugs. Also, if possible, find a theater that plays movies with subtitles.The editing is also hilariously bad, especially when coupled with the pretentious script. At multiple times two characters walk and talk. The movie will occasionally cut to two-second flashbacks and then cut back to the two talking characters who mysteriously appeared in completely different locations. Is... is this the same conversation? If they talk long enough, will they eventually end up on the moon, still talking about the same thing?Oh well, I suppose you could get a kick out of it when watching it as a parody of Nolan movies."
1011,"I didn't like Tenet, all show no substance + the dialogue either made no sense or was inaudible. Too many plotholes, it was also confusing and i don't think the protagonist carried the role well. 3/10 for the overhyped waste of 2hrs."
1012,"I'm not going to mix my words when it comes to ""Tenet"", its horrible.The script is, in my opinion, an incoherent mess, with a story line that defies reason and logic. Of course there's no fixing this core failing, so the train wreck just grows bigger and uglier, as this rather tedious tale unfolds. Or is that ""infolds"".Acting is mostly reasonable but the bad Russian character, in particular, is a Western mainstream media cliche. A misogynistic boogeyman, who might just destroy the world. If you can't read between the lines there, then you might not have been watching the MSM's current take on Russia. Not that I would blame you.Sets are expensive and special effects are above average. That said, there's not a lot going on under the hood, so to speak, so that really doesn't fix this film in a meaningful way.In short, if this one leaves you feeling confused its not you, its the story or perhaps the overall absence of one.3/10 from me."
1013,"I love science fiction and I'm also not dumb, but this film was the most confusing thing I've ever seen. It just doesn't flow well at all. The background sound effects and music were so loud in places you couldn't hear the dialogue. Compared to Nolan's previous films this was a big disappointment."
1014,"Sure it's a black guy in the lead scoring diversity points but who's he trying to save? The world or just on person?I want these hours of my life back please. Boring, predictable, meaningless."
1015,"Headphone users, God speed & good luck. We salute you."
1016,"It is so too complicated.
Is there anyone to explain it to me??
My brain = bommmmm
=)"
1017,"The plot of Tenet is a little hard to explain. John David Washington's character is forcede to swallow a cyanide pill after an operation at an opera house, but he wakes up in a hospital where he is told that he is a part of the organization, Tenet and his mission is to save the humanity. He is sent to a scientist who shows him that he can bend objects backwards in time. He teams up with Neil to find out what and who is threating the survival of the world.This is the first movie that I went to see in theaters since the movies opened back up. Just being in that auditorium and seeing a movie on the big screen today felt so weird, yet more magical than usual. It was pretty exciting! I have been excited for this movie ever since I saw the trailer and even before that. I try to go out of my way to see blockbusters with screenplays made from scratch. This film is very ambitious and there was a lot at stake here both for the quality of the film and the box office. How does Christopher Nolan's latest film fare?One thing that I can definitely say about Tenet is that it is original, especially for a big blockbuster. The story itself is not the most unique, but it has some of the most unique physics, world-building and scripts I have seen from a big film in a long time. There is a lot of complexity to the story and while it is confusing at first, the longer it goes, the more the physics and story makes sense. It helps that Tenet is one of those films that you need to pay attention to every step of the way. It moves at a brisk pace and details are easy to miss. While the film can be confusing at times, I was never bored by it. I had a blast watching this movie.The world in this film is insane. It revolves around the fabric of time and what going in the past can do to you. There are a lot of scientific terms used throughout and the stakes are high. Just the fact that you have a character who has the ability to go back in time and suck up the bullets they shoot is nuts. I love it personally. There are not that many films like this one in terms of world-building.The action set pieces are even crazier. They are so well-done and so beautifully shot, that my mouth was on the ground during these set pieces. Not only that, but it looks like the film had some great stunt work. There was one point where John David Washington was riding on top of a fire truck and the best way to describe that scene is badass. I could really use that word to describe that entire sequence. The most insane parts of the film are the scenes that have the set pieces go in reverse. They look stunning and they reveal a lot in the story. The twists are great and some of them genuinely surprised me. The film is filled with action so if that is what you are looking for, you will get plenty of terrific action here.As for the performances, John David Washington is great in the film and his character is given some really good development for someone that is shrouded in mystery. He does not even have a name! Robert Patterson is terrific and he has the best dialogue in the film. Elizabeth Debicki is good in her role, but her character did not do much until the end. However, she was very sympathetic with her relationship with her husband. Kenneth Branagh plays the villain and he is menacing beyond belief. He is pretty scummy too, but Branagh did an amazing job here. The villain is pretty good because of his presence and the way he plays mind tricks on his opponents. The supporting cast is really good as well.I need to mention this even though it is minor, but the dialogue is excellent in this film. It is well-written, it fits the tone of the film and it is very clever. There are several scenes that had me wanting to laugh because of the delivery and lines. It is a lot better than it would be for a film like this. The tone is pretty intense, but the film does make fun of the insanity of the world from time to time. It feels very balanced which is rare in films like this. The script treats the stakes seriously, but it does have fun with itself when it needs to.As for the technical aspects, the cinematography is gorgeous in the film and the set pieces are shot beautifully. There is some shaky cam and there a couple moments with some odd editing choices, but it is a great looking film otherwise. The sound design is great as well. In a way, I felt like I was a part of the action at times. It could very well be my theater, but the sound added intensity to the film. The musical score is awesome as well. It was original and it was powerful. There is a piece at the first reverse set piece that blew my mind a little bit.As far problems with the film go, it is a style over substance film on my first watch. That could easily change but there is so much action in the film, more than I ever expected. While the story is really good, some of the characters could have used a little more development. Lastly, I wish Debicki's character got to do more in the film.Other than that, I thought Tenet was great. It feels very different from most blockbuster films story-wise and tone-wise. It brings a unique world to the table and it matches it with a story worth telling. The action alone makes it worth a watch at least once. This film has some of the best set pieces I have ever seen. All of this makes Tenet a joy to watch."
1018,"A nice movie indeed. I enjoyed the colors and the bold choice of slow pace scenes at times. Characters were allright. I enjoyed the main character. He looks really humble, yet strong. Not meaning rather silly appreciation like of other secret agents as main characters in some more popular series like Mission Impossible.Anyways, as they started involving reverse entropy more, I got lost. It became hard to reconnect with the film. Also, details that reveal to be important to the story and the general possibilities with reverse thingy could have been conveyed somehow better to the viewer. But I could connect still. Because I enjoyed the overall quality.The movie and the reviews make me wanna rewatch it later. I gotta watch again though."
1019,"I went to see this in a standard screen near release day, only to be a little disappointed with the audio and dialogue mix and the overall theme of the movie.Decided to give it another go in IMAX - What a sensation. The audio was miles better, and I understood (mostly) everything!Definitely planning to see it again shortly.My only one wish (slight spoiler):For the ending to potentially occur at the location of the opera, as some strange far out testing site didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the films dynamics.Overall a fantastic Nolan production - near the top of my favourites from his repertoire.A must see"
1020,"Tenet is a good film. It is packed with action, and is only meant for people who can understand complicated and twisted plotlines. The acting is great, the plotline is great, the tension is great. I wasn't expecting Tenet to be this damn good! Some people don't like it and I'm okay with that, but I'm saying I enjoyed it. The cast was chosen well, and it paid off. Christopher Nolan is a genius! I'd say 10+ as it is quite intense, but nothing too bad. 10/10."
1021,"An extremely disappointing film by Nolan. We were so excited to break the lockdown period by watching this film, but we couldn't stand the ridiculousness for more than an hour and a half. Acting was just awful and devoid of any artistic skills. Script was poor, artificial, lacked originality and substance. Actors kept reciting cheesy platitudes about how this is worst than a nuclear holocaust. The concept could have had a potential, but the execution was so remarkably bad to the extent I even lamented the wasted budget that went on destroying a plane for vain."
1022,"A VERY complex, well done movie with a difficult plot that was hard to follow. I love Christopher Nolan films but this one could and should have been simplified some IMO."
1023,Good good good good 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌 very much 👌 very interested
1024,"The movie is very nice, but it would be even better if they edited the audio properly. Speeches are muffled and almost always covered by other sounds, which make a complex movie hard to follow and understand."
1025,"Kcilf taerg. Posterity sees all and is present in all timelines. This movie has a cuff cam and can sense when you're all in. Keep calm while watching. Armed with a catchphrase, a Protagonist must stop a madman with Greys Sports Almanac from unleashing a terrible future upon the present. An opening scene to rival the Dark Knight."
1026,Much like Nolan's previous you're going to have to pay attention. This movie was amazing an entirely new concept of time paradoxes and how things could potentially already being used. The execution and realism of the film is remarkable it puts you POV in the moment as things are happening very very little use of CGI the movie feels like you are there.
1027,"""So far as the theories of mathematics are about reality, they are not certain; so far as they are certain, they are not about reality.""
-Albert Einstein
---------------------------------------*spoiler*---------------------------------------Coincidentally, a few days ago I searched some content on Taylor sequence before I watch Tenet again. Of course, my knowledge about math back in college was broken, and I'm only here to give some personal reflections on this title. This is just for fun.The assumption of my deduction is: The algorithm (9 parts as a whole) is able to calculate the analytic solution of the intact timeline. An analytic solution is a closed form, so as the timeline, it's head to tail and is perfect. Given the algorithm and the technology developed by ""future human"", the combination of the two can then inverse the entire world. And this is exactly the reason why we need the algorithm to resolve the timeline function perfectly-every point on the timeline need to be predicted accurately and certain.So here our protagonist sits at a point on the timeline in the future, for some reason he needs to travel back to prevent the combination of the two--algorithm and inverse technology. Every time he came back to the past to make a small change can be considered as another superposition of term.
As we know, the analytic solution function can equate to the sum of its Taylor series near a certain point. The series is infinite, meaning more superpositions make a better approximation, to some acceptable extent. But sometimes, if the series of superpositions are not chosen properly, as in the movie--the event circle is not closed, the result of the sum would be divergent. This can cause the reality to be instable, and the future will no longer be close to the previous future.So, every time, as our protagonist comes back to finish the mission, he needs to make sure that their segmentation of timeline is closed and intact, like a circle. And at the same time, they need to successfully carry out the mission. Time is segmented into circles, and circles in circles.(About the causality: the analytic solution is like other mathematical axioms, it already exits, only to be discovered by human. So as the result, or the future. From the axioms, as from the future, we deducted backwards along our past timeline using approximation. In a certain small range, the approximation can be said as equal to the true resolution, which is harmonic. So the world is harmonic, as long as the infinite terms of superpositions come to a convergent value, to form a closed circle together with the cause.)Question: This may sound like ""Turtles all the way down"", but I still want to explain the process. As we know, Taylor series use the derivatives of a single point to make approximation. The layers of derivatives can implicate the change rate of the lower layer function. As the protagonist and his allies travel backwards making contact with the past, this becomes the natural source for gaining the change rate of the events. The friction they feel is then used by them to make decisions. So, I would like to understand the approximation as a natural thing happening constantly during the inversed process."
1028,"I agree with many of the users on here that the audio mix for this film is just horrendous!! The actor's lines are all mumbly. I felt like the movie was half done. The film seemed unfinished in not only the audio but the overall picture and action sequences too. At one point you could completely tell a fight sequence was choreographed. It's like the editing for this film was incomplete when released. It was hard to understand what was going on too. You shouldn't have to see a movie twice to understand and enjoy it, as another user suggested. I expected much more from this Nolan film, but I left wishing I had spend my money on a different movie."
1029,"At the end of the movie, I think they just re-doing what they had already done.🤔They actually just completing their task so the past event can happen/exist.Thinking about it makes my head hurts.Argghh.. I don't even know what i'm talking."
1030,"It's very hard to review Tenet having only seen it once because this is by far his most complex movie yet. It's been 24 hours since I've seen it and I'm still trying to understand how the movie is pieced together. I'm very anxious to see it again and unravel the story even more.The acting was excellent, The score was beautiful and exhilarating, the cinematography was breathtaking and the action set pieces were maybe the best i've ever seen in a film.It really is wonderful to have Christopher Nolan in our lives. He gives us such fresh and interesting film concepts while Hollywood continues to pour out primarily sequels and reboots."
1031,"The is the worst Nolan movie by a country mile. It feels like WB gave a high school student $200m to play with.Form over substance. It feels like the whole story is built around the time inversion visual mechanic that Nolan wanted to show off. He must have watched Shane Carruth's Primer and thought he could do it better, but instead logic is thrown out the window and plot holes are abound. And the viewer is instructed to dismiss it cause we're supposed to ""feel"" the movie and not think about it.Almost all the dialogue is cheesy exposition trying to explain the plot of the movie. There are no actual character moments.All the characters are uninteresting, uninspiring and as fleshed out as a skeleton. The motivations of the Protagonist are unknown.The only female character in this movie is an abused trophy wife.Non-stop mind-numbing action (but its action like you've never seen, so it gets 2 stars for this).This is a Michael Bay flick with Nolan's timey wimey signature on it, don't expect anything more."
1032,"I had very high expectations for the movie, and it did not disappoint. The casting and performances are 10/10. Washington nails the lead role while Pattinson and Debicki are great as supporting characters. Branagh plays an intimidating villain. Additionally, the score is captivating and well-crafted. One of the few I immediately purchased on iTunes.
The cinematography and action scenes are the best parts of the movie, especially the plane, truck, and third act scenes. You can really appreciate all the work it took to shoot these scenes practically, and it pays off. The plot is complex and multi-layered. This may not appeal to all movie-goers, but it means that repeat viewings will benefit one's understanding and enjoyment of the film. I have seen the movie twice, and enjoyed it even more the second time.
I would have liked to have seen more humor and depth to the characters, but this is a relatively minor complaint for me. The sound mixing on my first viewing was not good, I could barely understand much of the dialogue, but my second viewing at the same theater did not have this issue.
This movie is 9/10 for me. I would stop short of calling it perfect, but I will definitely be revisiting it for years to come. Tenet succeeds as an epic spy-thriller with the added sci-fy elements that Nolan is famous for. Excellent!"
1033,"""A"" for effort
""D"" for resultsThe sci fi idea is pretty good, the attempt to try to reflect it on the screen totally failed and it contradicted itself. You may have to manage to pay careful attention somehow in order to even notice that.This is all made worse by the excellent sub-bass sound-track, which elevates that part to a ""D"" from an ""F"" because you can't even hear the gunshots, let alone the dialogue.On the bright side, certainly a lot of effort went in to filming, and all the actors did great work.The sound engineering and editing totally failed, totally.The score is like a government cover-up of a toxic waste dump. Somebody clearly had the bright idea ""Hey, if we play the music loud enough maybe nobody will notice how bad the editing is...""I have to give this 4 stars because it is fascinating to see what works and what doesn't work from a film making perspective. Unfortunately this movie is a combination of both things that work and things that don't work, and that makes for a bad movie. If you are not into that kind of analysis, then you will probably give it less stars."
1034,"It was ok, but full of expected ""twist"", especially if one is interested in science fiction and time travel. Some things make no sense, others are heavily inspired to say the least by classic works on the topic of time travel. Terrible sound, but nice music. I didn't care about the characters at all, in my opinion they were poorly written."
1035,"I didn't have a clue as to what was going on, but quickly gave up on that and just enjoyed the action and seeing some beautiful parts of the world. Elizabeth Debicki is gorgeous and the only difficulty I had in hearing the script was when Branagh went into Shakespearean stage whisper whilst on the phone. Caught up on a bit of sleep during the few quiet moments."
1036,"It stinks, either way. Nolan may be known for his gimmicks (""dreams within dreams""), and some of them may serves as a foundation to make a movie on... But, ""inversion"" is a poor man's excuse for re-running the same scenes backwards, in order to pad out 2.5 hours of nonsensical garble barfed to screen.Casting is all over the place; acting is so-so; script is nonsense; screenplay is dumb; action is generic and uninspired. A film of this subpar quality attracting average user ratings in the high 7's, means that the bar of acceptability has been lowered to a subterranean level.Worse than both Dark Knight Rises and Interstellar, and will be overrated accordingly. 3/10 -- Nolan should stick to historical non-fiction."
1037,"I don't really want to need to watch a film 15 times to understand the plot.I got the general gist but why they were in specific locations etc. was just guessing.The premise itself is pretty basic, but it's just convoluted to confuse on purpose to make it seem like a more important film.I agree about the audio. Far too loud misic and background noise and couldn't understand the dialogue at times."
1038,I just saw the movie at the theatre. It is a total chaos! It is hard for someone to follow the plot which moves back and forth like the actors and the objects.It is hard to decrypt the dialogs and even watch the action sequences. Even the sound effects are annoying at some points. All of those combined with the film duration are enough to give you a headache and cry for the money you spend for that movie.A big disappointment from the director of batman begins and the prestige.
1039,"TENET is a once-in-a-lifetime cinematic experience.And not just for the visuals, the stunning action set pieces, the preference for practical effects over usage of CGI, or the awesome soundtrack by Ludwig Goransson.But for its insanely complex plot.To conceptualize such a multi-layered, crisp and smart script is already impressive. But to put it on paper, bring it to life via the visual medium of cinema, is just genius.I'll admit there are several elements of the plot I'm still trying to make sense of, but I'm glad I managed to have AT LEAST understood the main and general idea of the story. (Which in itself feels like a Herculean accomplishment)Emotional hangover is a thing, but I'm having an ""intellectual hangover"" from it. But I absolutely love this.It's sad to see a few critics bash this movie with poor ratings, because they don't like the complex aspect or that they have to make an effort to understand it. It's a bit like someone who is lactose intolerant giving a bad rating to a cheese fondue dish in a restaurant, simply because they can't eat it.That being said, one big flaw, and the only one I can think of currently which unfortunately impacts this experience, is the poor choice of the sound mixing. You can barely understand the dialogs over the score, which really makes you work hard to understand what the actors are saying.Can't wait to re-watch it (with English subtitles) once it's released digitally. (unfortunately need to avoid the cinema hall for a second viewing) I'd definitely be purchasing a digital copy, this one's for the collection.Take a bow, Christopher Nolan. An easy 9/10 from me."
1040,"First viewing: confusing and frustrating.
Second viewing: MASTERPIECE"
1041,"A bit disappointed. Especially after watching the 10 anniversary version of Inception, which contains a short documentary of how Chris is making Tenet in the beginning of the film.Well said in the title already, I imagine one day Chris just discovered a cool technique to use in film and wants to develop a reversed time but based from the happening of an event. Then he's like, umm, I need to make up a story for it.The cliche story of saving the world from the villain, feels like serving for the technique rather than expressing messages from the director.The technique is cool but what resonates with the audience is still the story."
1042,Just got out and I am sad to report a colossal misfire that is impossible to follow. Nolan out-Nolaned himself . Terrible fast talking obviously planted dialogue that you can't even hear at times. I'll forgive nolan he has like 8 other movies that are great
1043,"After seeing the trailer for Tenet about a dozen times in front of various other movies, my wife, I and 2 of our (older teen) kids went to watch the movie tonight. I have read and enjoyed dozens of science fiction time travel books, shows and movies over the years. However, not quite halfway throught the movie, we were looking at each other and considering walking out of the theater. My wife and kids wanted to leave, but I was hoping it would get better, so I talked them into staying. Unfortunately, the movie didn't get much better.Tenet does have some decent special effects peppered here and there, but it is also loaded down with long periods of people just sitting around and talking, which got kind of boring.If you like lots of flashbacks, and people sitting around theorizing about theories of cause and effect, time travel and such, then this might be your cup of tea. However, the whole movie came across like a boring college lecture from a professor who has trouble conveying his ideas. On a certain level, it seemed like an art film trying to be an action movie. Ultimately, I feel like the writer or director failed in his duties to help us relate to the characters, because by the end of the movie I really didn't care about any of them.If you're interested in an ENJOYABLE time travel movie, I would highly recommend an alternative: watching 2012's ""Safety Not Guaranteed"". That one has a plot that you can follow, relatable characters, and is fun to watch."
1044,"Loud music, Trippy plot, AMAZING! The movie does need close captions."
1045,"This is one of the most convoluted films out there. The idea was great but the delivery lucks consistency. The movie only shines in its 3rd act, but you will stop carrying way before that. The characters are weak and not interesting, except R. Pattinson, who stole the show. Unless you see it from the perspective of the creator, it's an unclear mess. Christopher Nolan is my favourite director, but he clearly missed the mark with this one. It's shouldn't be a necessity to watch a film 3 times just to understand its design. The Tenant fails to meet its own high expectations."
1046,"I loved this movie and I do agree that not everyone can understand when they first watch it but I did and loved it.
Looking at articles and reviews about the movie and telling audience that it should have been more of a friendship movie or there should have been more dialogue. But those people don't understand Christopher Nolan's mind. He makes movies that our minds can't think of. His movies are not like every other movie. Usually a heist or a James Bond movie will always be about stealing some money or being cool. But this is a masterpiece. Reversing time in a way that blows your mind.I wait for his movies every day because every movie I can predict but not his movies. That is what makes it special. The concept of being amazed and shocked. Rather than knowing what is going to happen."
1047,Honestly amazing filmmaking! But almost impossible to make out the dialogue under so many other sound layers.
1048,This kicked me in the face in a good way. It reminds me of watching The Matrix the first time in the theatre. As I watched I was impressed with fight mechanics as well as trying to rap my head around the plot. With The Matrix I left the movie and bought a ticket for the next showing. I need to see this movie again. Because of this some viewers didn't like the movie as much as me. I think this is a strength!Even if you don't enjoy the mental aspects of the movie you can enjoy the action. It keeps a steady pace through the whole film. It feels like a mix of James Bond and a thought provoking sci fi movie. For me this is perfect. To those who say this doesn't live up to movies like Inception or The Dark Knight series. I say you gave up too easily. You need to spend some time with this one.
1049,"One of the few good things about 2020. If you are ready to burn your brain.. If you love cinema by Nolan you will enjoy this masterpiece as well. He continues his approach of defining time and reality as he did with Inception and Interstellar however, this time he made it more complex by using different time lines in the same room/situation/present. I will definitely watch this movie over and over again as I did with his other movies because there are so many details that it is impossible to catch them all at once. As always very good score/atmosphere and a good selection of actors especially, John David Washington and Robert Pattinson made a perfect duo. Hope to see more movies by him! Cool factor 10/10!"
1050,"This is the story of a soldier who gets involved in saving the world from a disaster worse than the world war 3. In the movie, both sides of the story have access to a machine that changes the entropy of the objects. When a person walks out of the machine the time and objects are backward for him (the cars are driving backward and people are walking backward). The story is incredible. I watched a lot of movies about time travel, but this one is unique and novice. John David Washington and Kenneth Branagh were awesome. The sound effects, background music, and special effects were incredible.
The action scenes are great. I have never watched action scenes with objects moving backward. The movie is well-directed. I can see the evolution of Christopher Nolan as a director by looking at his movies Memento 2000, Batman Begins 2005, The Dark Knight 2008, Inception 2010, Interstellar 2014, and Tenet 2020. He is one of the incredible directors of our era. My favorite scene is the battlefield scene with two forces one from the future and one from the current time (the time and objects are in reverse for these two groups). In summary, if you are a fan of action or Sci-Fi, you have to watch this movie."
1051,"An interesting concept, flushed down the drain and smothered with exposition. I swear, 50% of this movie is people explaining things at such high speeds of talking. I found myself going cross-eyed trying to keep up and just didn't care what was going on. Washington's Protagonist character is boring, uninteresting, and falls flat on his face with the forced comedic lines (no one laughed once in my theater). Every other character is either forgettable or purely there to give exposition. It is technically impressive with great visuals, action choreography and planning, as all Nolan movies are. It's time for Nolan to try something new and get away from exposition heavy, high concept movies. Dunkirk was a good step in the right direction, but Tenet falls back. Also ONCE AGAIN has the Nolan trope of something in the beginning of the movie is actually from the end of the movie. Give us something new, not just tired ideas."
1052,"Another spectacular film outing with a Nolan flick. Another film pushing the limits and bringing new life to the cinema. I am not speaking in hyperbole, this movie is a banger."
1053,"Visually it is occassionally spectacular, with some truly exceptional techniques on display that are worthy of praise. Everything else is the usual Nolan fare, ie. not very good.The characters are uninteresting, the script is a bloated chore (endlessly over-explaning it's exceedingly simple premise, similar to Inception) and the sound mixing is shamefully amateurish. All of Nolan's films have terrible sound production, but this is by far and away his most egregious example. This man really needs to get his hearing checked, or employ somebody who knows what high-pass filter does.The soundtrack is ok (I think?) - there are flashes of creativity here and there, but they are unfortunately swamped by the aforementioned mix. The production design is decent, with quality sets and excellent lighting/camerawork, so definitely worth seeing if you're into cinematography as a craft. It's just that all of the other elements let it down.I've seen all of Nolan's films once and never felt compelled to return to them. This fits neatly into that trend."
1054,"I literally cannot write a review with spoilers because i cannot parse what i just saw. its like inception but bad. there were SO many plot threads that go nowhere, one-off unmemorable characters that are supposedly extremely important.
i cant blame anything but the writing, directing, and editing. everything else was up to par, but someone, somewhere, butchered this movie."
1055,I've never watched a more confusing and disjointed film. I thought the story may start to unravel as the film progressed but alas it didn't and got even more confusing. I basically just gave up trying to understand it and stuck it out to the end. Just tried to enjoy the fact we were at the cinema for the first time in months. Acting not great and neither was the script. Definitely not worth going to see. Very disappointed!
1056,"I love Nolan, but I have no idea how the film resolved at the end, as many plot points were lost to background noise and couldn't be heard at all. It was often like watching a foreign language film. For a film that's already tricky to understand to be even harder through poor audio was infuriating. The cinema staff confirmed lots of other patrons had said the same thing. Such a shame as I'm sure there is an amazing film underneath the poor sound. I'll wait until it comes out on TV and will turn the subtitles on"
1057,"Warning: If you found Inception confusing you're going to have a bad time. If you enjoyed Inception then this film is right up there.There is a video of Christopher Nolan (the director and writer) explaining the story telling process of Momento, another one of his fantastic films. The story of this film is like that except that it is two rings that overlap and interchange except we are perceiving it along a linear timeline. I know that doesn't make sense, but the very nature of this movie makes you question the concept of time in both our perception of it and how it interacts with our physical universe.This film will take a few watches to grasp everything that is happening, but the fact that 2 days later I am still thinking about it means it is a fantastic film."
1058,The storyline is surprisingly dull and makes no sense on several occasions. No comparison to Interstellar.
1059,"This will be one of the best movies in this decade.
For the first half of the movie you understand nothing but all the clues are in front of you but you don't know what they mean, but in the second half you understand everything gradually.
You need to watch it more than once to gasp all of its glory."
1060,"Before starting, I have to admit one thing. I clearly understand all the criticism and confusiob. The film was quite hard to follow, even for me who is a film student. I will tell you why.Nolan generally sticks to a formula when it comes to his scripts. Characters letting go of their attachments for the greater good. A lot of his movies devote about an hour to exposition and drop almost all of its lore through dialogue. Therefore his past work such as Inception and Interstellar feel like a slow burns that culminate in a third act spectacle. Tenet... is not that.The only genuine flaw I found in this movie was the fact that Nolan did not take his time in the first act. Instead, The Protagonist seemed to appear in one place after another, giving us constant lore drop. While this up-best editing style works within the realms of this movie, it ultimately fails to hook you to the characters like you did to Cobb and Cooper. Constant focus is on the action, except when Miss Debicki appears to add a more human side to the story. But since her conflict is not established in about half an hour like Cobb's was in Inception, it aas harder to connect with her at first.However, this was not an issue once you manage to understand some of the core ideas of this film. I won't be spoiling any of them but Tenet practically is a mixture of Inception, Interstellar and Memento. Whether it be Murpht's Law, manipulating time and space through inversion, or moving back and forward in time simultaneously; the movie really delivers in its scientific aspect. If you are a casual viewer who is used to formulated plotlines, you will not like it. Which brings me to the title of this review.Our minds weren't meant to understand this movie in one go. The concept of ""moving inversely in time"" while others don't is a fairly unique concept. Never been done on this scale. So just like how 2001: A Space Odyssey divided audiences (some say it's a masterpiece, some just can't grasp it), Tenet will not satisfy everyone. It's a very imaginative and futuristic work which was made for the future. When? Who knows. But your understanding of the concepts and character motivationd which are subtely placed will grow with every viewing. So I advice you to see it again. Knowing what will happen, look out for the details. If you manage to see the right things in the frame, you will be surprised.I have to add though. I watched it with subtitles so I have no idea if the mixing was as bad as people make it out to be. I managed to understand some of the important lore drops through subtitles so, not having them could be an issueHope this helps!"
1061,"The movie, was confusing. An casual viewer will find this hard to follow and will need multiple watches to get their head around. The cinematography and special effects are superb, shame the audio mix was a bit off on a non iMax screening"
1062,"If I were to watch this movie with the sound off I might have had a better experience. The movie is well shot with some incredible locations and action sequences. Unfortunately the audio mix was unbearably loud and completely ruins this film.I saw this in IMAX and the audio was so loud the dialogue (even during moments with no background music) was distorted and very difficult to understand. Think Bane's mask distorted. Think explosion level loudness anytime someone is speaking. Even worse, much the important dialogue is spoken while the score is roaring in the background. By the film's climax I barely understood nor cared how we go there. That's partly due to the complex story but also because I had no idea what anyone said for 80% of the film.According the the theatre staff the audio levels for the IMAX version are set by the film and must be strictly adhered to. They mentioned that they had been told not to adjust the audio levels for this film except on case-by-case basis, and that the loudness/distortion was actually an intended effect by the film. The fact that staff already had a memo circulating on this issue tells me I'm not the only one who felt this way.Turn it down Nolan, I shouldn't need to bring earplugs to your film."
1063,"As we used to, Nolan loves playing with our minds. Understanding inception was Ceiling of my expectations But it was the Basement as to Nolan., yes, I am getting why they do that and the dramatic reasons of the movie But It was too difficult to understand the physics that shown in Tenet. The Action in the film was really Amazing and unique. Elizabeth Debicki did a great performance in the film and I really loved the Robert Pattinson character. John David Washington was so cool in the film. The interconnectedness of the characters was great.Nolan ensured that we can't change the past, but can affect on it. At the end, I liked the movie and have no problem with the movie. My rating for Tenet is 8.5"
1064,"Firstly Washington and Patterson mind blowing acting from both. I always doubted Patterson however after that his got it. It just came out today I'm South Africa and I had to watch it. I must say I stayed away from all reviews or theories and I'm glad. The movie is excellent; from acting, scenery, relationships, and plot it's just simply a masterpiece. The music is a definite highlight the character's emotions and feelings are transferred to the viewer. The movie is deceptive I don't want to spoil however everything is right in front of you - another HUGE WIN is that the audience and the main character (WASHINGTON- what a performance) have the same knowledge. What he knows you knows, what he is confused about you are confused about, and what he learns you learn - it all happens in real time. I've never felt so engaged and attached to a movie. There's so much to say however every single individual in this movie production or movie was excellent. The concept of inversion is simply mind boggling- truly it is mind blowing stuff. I'd say pay attention but Nolan and the characters will have your full attention. So I definitely recommend you don't bother streaming off some website and go pay to watch this movie. Honestly it's worth paying for, the amount of quality in this movie is exceptional. So as Nolan said "" Don't try understand it, feel it..."". Forget the bad reviews or whatever this movie transcends so much. I'm not one to write reviews but this movie is incredible- it's not a money grabber or money driven. It's about art as just wow. Best movie I've seen- I'd say for me it's now number one. Thank you to Nolan, actors, and everyone who brought this masterpiece to life."
1065,"Mind blowing realistic visual spy adventure film like 007+Inception with sci-fi like Interstellar, Nolan'll keep you stick on your seat from beginning to the end. Keep concentrate for all detail from start to make sure you won't lose track or misunderstanding because last-half of the film'll show no mercy to audience for his terrific story. IMAX 70mm. is the best way to experience it. Anyone who like to play complex puzzle or jigsaw'll absolutely love this film."
1066,Christopher Nolan's latest film was the best action film of all time in the history of cinema. This is a masterpiece of science fiction and a great blackbuster. Be sure to see this movie in the cinema and you will be amazed to see Nolan's genius. My rating for this movie is 98/100.
1067,THE SCENES ARE AMAZING WITH SOUND EDITS and EFFECTS. I had brain orgasm while watching it on theatres. This movie should not be watched without a sound system.
1068,"How can you possibly even try to understand such a complicated movie, preteniously so, when you can't understand the dialogue. And it's not even the dialogue, just the straight up mixing. Explosions, fire, shots, engines, you name it do not sound as they should. This is in part of how the audio was captured and how it's modulated post production.Example - many times protagonist man is wearing a helmet so any of the audio comes through as if we're all wearing helmets. Muffled, muddy, distorted. As mentioned before, it ID incredibly tedious.I write this review while the movie is ending. Do I care? Not a bit! Pretty much every negative review huts the nail on the head, so I'm not sure if I've added anything new. I expected so much more, and perhaps the substance is there, it's just a muddled mess."
1069,"When you make a movie that pretends to be a lot but is badly written and acted it's garbage. Nolan made with Tenet his first major flaw and you can say anything you want about this movie but it pretends a lot but is nothing.The first major problem I have with this movie is the casting and level of acting.
The protagonist plays this 2-D character with unrealistic conversations like they come directly out of a Gilmore Girls. The second casting flaw is the Antagonist which is a Irish actor with a bad Russian accent, come you can come with something better than the Russian cliche (with bad accent).Second major problem is the chemistry between the actors and characters. Washington has to save to world from some kind of apocalypse (boring) but is mostly busy with saving Debicki but why is the question since there seems to be no deeper connection between the two characters.Third problem I had was the fact that Debicki keeps talking about how she does not want to lose here child with who the viewer had no connection since the son has no lines in the whole movie and is maybe 5 minutes in the film, this irritated me the whole movie.The plot of the movie is typically Nolan style but with the movies flaws it just does not work out good this time.Nolan has the same problem as Burton had several years ago, he has his style and made some great movies (Memento!!) but does the same trick again and with the bad casting and writing this movie is only some nice shots and a great musical soundtrack."
1070,"Writing is terrible, story even more so. So long and boring that it leaves you begging for it to end.
Don't waste your money."
1071,"Visually it was entertaining but if you sat me down and asked me to explain it, I really don't think I could."
1072,"Saw the film yesterday. Only some of the action scenes are good. The story is full of BS and illogical stuff. Nolan has an idea, that he doesn't think trough though at all. Even the 'basic' things (like the empty gun getting reloaded when pointing at a target) are totally flawed. The result is an overlong BS movie. 1/10."
1073,"When I watched interstellar and I didn't liked it people told me that I didn't understand the film and I say director failed to teach me.
That's how this film is also, it is confusing and like most of the Nolan films it has no soul but nonetheless it is an spectacle you can't miss"
1074,Not for me. Boring af. Amateur stuff. Weak narrative. Weak cinematography.
1075,The movie has no logic. Worst movie except a few action scenes.
1076,"Wow another incredible movie made by Nolan, definitely need to watch again. If you go watch it highly recommend experiencing it IMAX like most of his films. My mind was blown by end of movie"
1077,"Good:
Very interesting idea of time travel
Cool unseen action scenes making use of the reverse mechanicBad:
Poor audio mixing, can't hear the actors
Plot makes no sense
No character build-up, relationships seem forced
The entire movie feels like a showcase of action scenes using the time mechanic, without ever explaining how it actually works and being physically impossible or inconsistent during the movie
No ""wow"" moment for me regarding the plot, everything is predictableI had low expectations going to the movie but it was a lot worse than I expected"
1078,"The line near the beginning that the female scientist gives, that you shouldn't worry if it doesn't make sense should be the tagline. But then, it renders so much of the film pointless.Gimmicky and terribly disappointing despite a great cast and talented director."
1079,"For my first movie in a real theater since Knives Out, I got the cinematic pleasure of watching Tenet. I am proud to say that Christopher Nolan has not lost any of his talent, and it shows in every single shot of this film. Just like Momento, the story slowly unfolds, with more pieces of the puzzle fitting together as the story moves forwards (and backwards, it's hard to explain.). What Nolan does best is his complex use of time travel, or more accurately, time reversal. Our protagonist, only billed as ""Protagonist"", is brought into an organization known as ""Tenet"", tasked with stopping World War 3.The film is intentionally vague about it's plot, which mirrors the limited information that our protagonist is told at first. Many details that happen early on in the movie get explored later, such as a car flipping over, backwards. We later see that our protagonist was driving this car, but in the ""Inverse"" state. The time reversal slowly makes more sense, and it all culminates in an extremely fun battle scene where two sides of the same army have to fight off an enemy, both in the normal time zone and the inverse time zone.The sound design sells this film, and every music score makes the film much more than just a movie. I have to address the most gaping issue in the movie: the sound mixing. Just like most of Nolan's movies, the overbearing sound effects often drown out the character's dialogue. In a movie like this, it's a much bigger issue when the plot is so convoluted. This will certainly be a huge issue for many viewers, but I honestly had a pretty easy time understanding the story, and didn't need subtitles.
It's a total cinematic experience. Every actor sells their performance, especially John David Washington and Robert Pattinson (very excited to see him in the future!). The effects are absolutely stunning, and I'm sure that Nolan's insistence on using practical effects came in handy when making each action scene look authentic as possible. The story is intentionally hard to follow, but it shows nothing less than the complete mastery of its genre by Nolan. This is the most fun that I have had watching a movie in a long time. I will be recommending Tenet to every respecting filmmaker in the future, and I am happy to see that this is what the theaters are opening up to around the world."
1080,"A dull story cleverly made that has more holes that a tea-bag!John David Washington play his character way too aloof, too cool for school or just rudely odd. Nolan has written the Protagonist as uncharismatic in a spy thriller that replies so much on the time element it totally forgets to make the characters two dimensional.I understand the time/inversion element, but it never explains how the 9 parts of the algorithm were placed in the past? In this film to travel into the past you have to physically do the travelling yourself but you need oxygen to keep you alive, so...
1. How do you travel years, decades or centuries into the past to hide the parts of the algorithm without oxygen? And people noticing a person going backwards? I know some will say the parts of the algorithm were inverted, then buried so they keep travelling back in time. But that would mean if you invert an object it will continue backwards in time indefinitely, which means all the guns and bullets inverted would, eventually, be found in ancient history?At some point, again never explained, Kenneth Branagh's character builds the inversion machines, so...
2. How did he build it with the present day technology? Yes I know he was sent the plans, but you could send the plans on how to build a mobile-phone to your great great great grandfather and they would mean nothing to him and even if he did understand the concept he still couldn't built one in 1871!!!
3 Which means if you travel backward 'inverted' past the point the first inversion machine/booth was ever built how the hell do you invert back into normal time. Will enough canisters of oxygen you could travel years, but without the inversion booth you can't move back into normal time.4. The film never explain eating or getting old during being inverted. Do you age?
5. Go watch Red Dwarf Season 3 Episode 1 'Backwards' to see what happens if you need to go to the toilet while travelling backwards in time!6. if you keep going forwards and backwards there will be multiple versions of yourself. 20 trips 20 versions. I know it says in the film you can't touch a version of yourself as this would be catastrophic, but the main character has a fight with himself!!! And he was bleeding!7. Why has no one travelled back to tell themselves about all the events, which they could then avoid from ever happening, like the inverted phone he gave Kat, which she uses to call him to stop her being assassinated. They prove they can change time/history so just go way back to before the film events start and end it then!8. Why was Priya trying to assassinate Kat anyway? What was the point?9. Was it just me or was Aaron Taylor-Johnson just playing a part that looked and sounded like it was written for Tom Hardy? Because 'Ives' is by far the best part of this mess of a $200 million film."
1081,"WOW. What a trip!!! My head's still spinning.
But that's Nolan. That's what he does.
Just when you think you're starting to figure it out, he convolutes it 1000% folding the story over itself like origami! (to borrow another reviewer's expression).
..and you thought 'Inception' was hard to wrap your head around? HA! It *is* a complicated movie that requires multiple viewings. I'll definitely be going for seconds.
AMAZING."
1082,"After all, Nolan is a great director? This does not mean that all films must be perfect."
1083,"I hate it when film makers treat the audience like they're stupid. We don't need to be handed every piece of obvious information; we can figure it out. We have a brain. On the other hand, a film's job is to present a story to us, from beginning to end. The movie is supposed to be the entire experience; why make a film if people will have to Google the plot afterwards? If your story needs further explanation, you haven't told a story, you've told a snippet of a story.This is one of the main reasons 'Tenet' is underwhelming. A confusing story is one thing, for it can eventually be figured out. But this script is actually murky, reasons and plotlines hidden and distorted with no explanation. What's worse, the characters always seem to know exactly what's going on all the time. They don't help guide us through the maze, they drag us through behind them.The film's other flaw is how wasted the idea is. As stated in the movie, it's not time travel, it's time inversion. Quite different, but the only payoff we get is fighting a rich dude who's a jerk. I honestly didn't think there would be a stereotypical world-hating villain in this movie, but that's what we get. His presence mucks up what would've been a more interesting story. Also, the rules of going into time inversion are hilariously cliched - things like ""Don't touch your past self or you'll explode"" or ""Hey, that person I saw earlier was actually ME!""That being said, there are a few exciting action scenes and the reverse fights are kind of cool. The actors are doing their best and it's not their fault that you can barely hear some of their important dialogue (thank you, sound mixer).I get the feeling this was almost a vanity project on Christopher Nolan's part. It's been a little while since he made one of his signature ""complicated"" features and wanted to make this one as artsy-fartsy as possible. Two or more viewings would be required to understand it properly.As I wrap this up, remember that a good movie isn't one you have to watch twice. A good movie is one you want to watch twice. 'Tenet' is the former. If you want a good film that messes with time, just watch 'Back to the Future' again."
1084,"May reviews will tell you that the story is complicated, confusing and hard to grasp. While this is absolutely correct, those reviews then continue to praise this complexity for making the movie ""intellectually challenging"". This is where I'm not on board. The movie is complicated, confusing and hard to grasp because it really does not make any sense at all. While this is the case for most time-travel stories, Tenet lacks even the slightest hint of trying to make up for those enormous loopholes by any explanations. Instead of trying to come up with an explanation, everything is just left as being ""mysterious"" and ""unexplainable"". Everytime the story is challenged by some time-trave-paradox, this is swept aside or vainly hidden by another of the unending action sequences. Speaking of the action sequences: they are sometimes entertaining, but most of the time just a drag. Dialog is wooden at best, complete and utter nonsense most of the time. Characters are not developed and have no purpose and the entire movie ist just really a rotation of the feelings ""how long is this going to take"", ""aaah, come on, you have to be joking"" and ""I can't believe Nolan did not invest 5 minutes on his script""."
1085,"This is the worst action movie what I have seen in my entire life. I literally mean it. Absolutely everything is wrong about this movie. Plot/story. Acting.Overcomplicated to the level which I have never seen before.Sound track - absolutely terrible, is trying to create false sense of urgency, unpleasant, heavy, irrelevant to the scenes.So many side stories, everything is mixed, super hard to understand what is happening, poorly executed.Even sound engineer failed during this project - it is super hard to understand dialogues.Basically expect inception style movie, but poorly executed, no special effects (you won't see anything fancy).This movie has absolutely no sense. It supposed to be a mega hit. It is a mega disaster.I left cinema angry. Totally disappointed.
Absolutely do not go for this movie. And if you have to go for some reason (please do not), do not take your girlfriend (she will hate you)."
1086,"Most people won't like this film due to the horrible sound. Many people were covering their ears at times, or putting in ear buds. Most people couldn't hear significant patches of the dialogue. I'm just glad I didn't take my wife, who is not a native English speaker. She would have just left the theater. Personally, I gave up after 2/3rds and considered leaving. If you ask the people working at the theater they will probably explain that you are not the only one complaining. I'm spending most of the review on the sound because it is the main thing you will think about when you leave the theater.If you're the kind of person who thinks movies provide deep insight into metaphysics then you'll love this one. If you're either too dumb or too smart for that then you'll be slightly irritated by the plot which vacillates between predictable and incoherent.When the movie is released on digital download and someone fixes the sound or you can watch with subtitles it'll be a solid gentleman's B."
1087,"I am a big fan of Christoper Nolan. His previous works are among my favourite films of all time; Interstellar, Batman, The Prestige, INCEPTION!But this movie is different. Nolan ordinarily blends heart pumping action with deep, emotional storylines. You WANT Cobb to get back to his kids, you're heartbroken for Murph when her dad leaves, you're thrilled at the big reveal in The Prestige. Tenet? I just didn't care.There's very little dialogue here, and so much of it is inaudible, I didn't really connect with the characters at all.I think Nolan got excited with this movie. He clearly has a penchant for exploring paradoxes and other dimensions, but normally they're well explained during calm moments. Again, despite a few bits of dialogue, those calm moments of clarity are missing from Tenet.It made me think of a few other movies that I didn't really connect with emotionally at a character level, and they all have one thing in common. They were books first.I love to read, but occasionally when I don't get a movie, someone will say to me; ""I know what you mean, but if you read the book it will make a lot more sense.""I fear this is what happened here. Nolan had the story mapped out to perfection in his head no doubt, but it just didn't come across on film for me, it's a mess.As ironic as it sounds, maybe someone can go and write a book called Tenet - and posthumously revive this movie so people can connect the dots and love the characters. It would be a nice bonus if some of the convoluted concepts in the movie are also addressed in the amount of detail that is required to make this movie enjoyable. As I said, ironically, maybe we can then we can go back and watch the movie from another perspective."
1088,It was the worst film I have seen in ages. Bad muddled story line and the actors were mundane. It didn't feel or look like a professional blockbuster movie but a third rate bad bbc effort. The film industry will soon end if they keep knocking them out like this.
1089,Simply epic. Not able to describe what I just saw.
1090,"A movie that tells you not to worry too much about the concept but continues to spend an hour explaining. A quarter of which is drowned out by sound effects and the sound track.A very unoriginal soundtrack i might add.Found my mind drifting at certain points in the film didn't quite grab me as expected.Found a lot of the characters bar John David Washington's and Robert Pattinson's to be paper thin.
Woman who loves son.
Bad guy who is bad.Good performances all round.Some great action scene's.One instance of poor special effects.Worth a watch once, don't feel the need to revisit it."
1091,When you watch a film especially after six months you want to enjoy it well I did not and I hate overly loud films that try and compensate for a lacklustre movie this is a prime example. I'm so disappointed with this flick.
1092,An outstanding film that really does make you think. Any negative reviews will just be from people who can't keep up. CN has pushed the boundaries even further from Inception & Interstellar.
1093,"If anyone other than Nolan had come to the cinema with such a plot, they would have laughed in his face. But, since it's Nolan's, no one can admit it's full-of-plot-holes nonsense. Well, I'll do it: the king is naked!"
1094,"The script idea of Tenet is great and like most Nolan movies it has this grandiose and monumental feeling (Hans Zimmer helps with that as always) that makes the audience appreciate him even more as a director.The execution though is far enough from his older movies (Inception,Interstellar), which both are using time as a script machine to move the players and the action.Tenet uses each own Idea when it wants, then other times it forgets it, then other times the montage takes over to over-complicate everything for no reason.
And I say no reason cause while watching the movie you progressively find no reason to find out what happens in the end. You do not get attached with the characters and what they are trying to do like in Interstellar or Inception.Direction is great, main actors are pretty good(Washington and Patinson) but everyone else is kind of forgettable.If you undress the over-complicated script and montage you will be left out with a Bond movie. A bad Russian guy who wants to destroy the world just because his ego is bigger than Jupiter and because he is dying.This alone makes Tenet a mediocre movie, and one of Nolan's weakest. Still, I respect him for trying to execute a script like that even though he kind of failed."
1095,"The message is about the butterfly effect, is about us making the right choices in life because one mistake can affect an entire generation. Neil (Robert Pattinson) was from the future the whole time. Also him, the protagonist (John David Washington) and Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh) were communicating with themselves from the future through a type of inversion warning them to change the past. It was Sator's fault, he wanted to build a new civilization on the future that wouldn't live in drought. Then Neil and the protagonist got the information from themselves that they had to save the world from what Sator was going to do, actually to destroy the whole existence of life, while he thought that he was saving it. You can relate that to the New World order, higher ups that depopulate the planet in multiple ways like (pharmaceuticals, wars, separation etc.).
The movie touches the subject of belief too. Andrei Sator said that he does NOT believe, he just know, but knowledge is based on belief, that's why he fooled himself that he was the chosen one to annihilate the world and make a new one, he was so blind because he only believed in himself, while he was claiming that he didn't have belief."
1096,To bad!!!!!! Total waste of time.. I wasted 3 hours of my life. When I get old and someone ask me: What would you change in your life. I would say: I wouldn't go watch Tenet to the cinema.
1097,"It's outrageous. Incredible action scenes, really loud, the plot is a total nonsense, but mostly fun. It's also, in my humble opinion, the worst Nolan movie by a country mile. Cinematography is atrocious (for Nolan standards), it's incredibly fast paced, disjointed and the editing is scandalous. It's the first Nolan movie which truly feels just like a blockbuster. Above average one, but still. Two leads, Washington and Pattison were great, but the characterization is weak, almost non-existent because it's all action. Brannagh's villain was ok-ish, Debicki's character seemed like she was added in the third week of filming, and I didn't care for any of the characters. Emotional connection? None. Dialogue was so corny at times. At one point Pattison's character is explaining the rules of backwards-time-travel-thingy, and it felt like he was literally explaining it to the audience. Bottom of the barrel.Nolan is no Tarkowski, but he's been making some of the most interesting mainstream movies of the last 15 years, and it's sad seeing him fall this hard. Felt like he made half of the movie, and then some random guy shot the rest and then it was all edited together poorly. It's worth seeing for several incredible but very brief shots, great action scenes, sets and sound, as well as ridiculous plot which will be memed to death. If that's your thing, go for it, otherwise, steer clear."
1098,"Very disappointing because the storyline was horrible, complicated and confusing. The background music was too loud, I could not hear the dialogue. I have better TV Shows than this weird movie."
1099,"I guess Nolan badly wanted to do a movie around the centre element of the movie (will not spoil it) and just went ahead to do it. No context, no depth, no real script.It's quite bad, not only for Nolan's standards, but generally. Going in to see a movie by such a mastermind you can't but have high expectations; none is met in this film.Horrible sound (bring your earplugs), horrible cheesy dialogue and too long and preachy.I couldn't wait for it to finish."
1100,"... then let me tell you please next time value your audience more!
You have spent over 200 million dollars on this movie, but you didn't take your time to watch and listen to it before releasing it to the cinemas. The audio is the worst faulty production i ever experienced - we simply cannot hear the conversations!!! The movie wants us to think and put the pieces together, but how should we do that if we do not hear what the characters are saying!!!
My other general inpression of the movie is that after directing such smart and moving movies like the inception and interstellar, you did not care about your audience at all. You directed a movie for yourself, and let your audience figure out whatever they want from it. And finally where is the heart in this movie, where are the emotions? Characters do not develop anywhere and do not ignite any emotions at all. It is a 200 million dollars worth of posing mindless adrenaline rush.
Please for your next movie get down to earth and start respecting your audience again.
With all respect, thank you."
1101,"History has its own rules. We always have a chance to challenge,because that is result."
1102,"Just some folks moving forward, others moving backward."
1103,"Sadly I didn't like most of it, in fact the only thing I liked was the visuals.Worst Nolan movie until now."
1104,"You should not have to think I really need to rewatch that movie to see if I get it at all - but this is how Tenet leaves you feeling. Plot twists thrown together for the sake of it which contradict themselves. It's like it was written over five years by 10 different people and then stuck together - it needed a re-edit at the end but someone ran out of time. We are told you must not meet in the parallel time line yet the main character fights himself. Bullets appear from no where yet we know they had to be shot at a certain time. Huge gateways are built to the future but you have to enter and exit at the same time. Grandfather theory this but what will be will be that. Yes big bangs, huge sets and some good Fight scenes. However Washington is not believable as a tough guy, Branagh needs to retire from such roles and poor old Michael Caine! Pattinson just about makes a good effort. Don't expect Inception ""phew"" or even Interstellar ""arh yes of course"" Very poor Nolan."
1105,People have to wear masks in the inverted world.Love. It.
1106,"In a world where nothing is what it seems, we are treated time and time again. This movie delves deep into our mind and what we may think- in the past, the present and the future. Its a challenge to watch, with some massive sounds warping your perception to further muddy the waters. Its about time travel.Should you feel like you need to watch this twice? Maybe, that depends. Did i enjoy vast amounts of the movie? Absolutely, great action, top acting from the whole cast (including accents?), a sophisticated plot and never did i feel like going to the toilet.I suggest you go watch this for 2 reasons: first, Christopher Nolan has made another excellent film and second: challenge yourself"
1107,"This movie is a marvel of spectacle and originality. Christopher Nolan is still one of the best directors working today. I am very pleased to see him continue to produce original experiences like this movie. But if you like or dislike his work I feel you'll find the same praises and flaws of his previous works. This movie can easily be compared to inception based on its concept (from the trailer) and rightfully so. What this movie lacks is a strong sense of emotional attachment to the characters you are following. This flaw seems to come purely so that the concept of ""inversion"" is fully explained and carried out by the plot. And trust me, it is a sight to see by the end. Worth a watch on the biggest screen you can find open during our pandemic."
1108,"Well, the film was absolutely genius for us. For sure it was mind blowing, as all films created by this director.
There are few tips you should to keep in mind before watching this film:
1.read about it
2.The words at the beginning of the film : don't try to understand it-feel it are directed to the viewer and are the best advice for you. Because you should watch thoroughly the first part of the film, pay attention to the details and simply try to remember what was going on. But never ever try to understand the first part of the film - simply accept it😂
3.The second part of the film will explain almost everything if at the beginning you more or less caught what it's all about.
4.The last recommendation- prepare that you will feel the need to watch it the second time in order to fully understand the plot. It is the film that should be watched several times.
To conclude, the film is great, complicated but nevertheless, marvellous and breaks you brain but it worth it😂"
1109,"Nolan has far surpassed himself - no longer in the realm of science fiction with a hard F, moreso in the realm of *science* fiction, with an emphasis on the former. This movie functions as his follow up/spiritual successor to Inception: a mostly action packed film with a core plot ""gimmick."" Unfortunately whereas 50% of Inception is exposition to carry a stumbling audience through what they're seeing, Nolan has largely dispensed with exposition for the core plot gimmick apart from throwaway lines from the scientist that John David Washington's character first meets and Robert Pattinson later on in the movie. What most audience members will absorb is the ""go with the instinct"" part and the simple mechanic of ""things traveling backwards through time.""In reality, Nolan has found a way to realize through a physics based explanation his long yearned for time travel plot. Essentially, the ""time stiles"" that the characters pass through are antimatter conversion devices - transforming all who pass through it into the antimatter ""inverted"" versions of themselves. Antimatter being matter that is identical to regular matter but traveling backwards through time - with reversed entropy. The movie's logic then flows from there - with characters at various points encountering the antimatter versions of themselves (creating a minor plot hole at one moment when JDW's character fights himself going backwards in time without causing any sort of annihilation - which would necessarily occur when matter-antimatter collides).Overall it's a masterful script that combines tightly conceived action setpieces with a fascinating core mechanic and includes various Easter eggs due to the time travel element and reversal of causality that merits several watches to appreciate it in all its complexity. It's also extremely bold and very appreciated for a mainstream director to release a movie that upwards of 70% of audiences will not be able to understand fully. Nolan is making the movies that he enjoys and is mostly concerned with delivering a great experience without really caring to spell out the ABCs of what's happening to the average moviegoer. The cinematography, action, etc are all amazing of course. The score is very memorable and is reminiscent of the heavy 80s synth from Netflix's Bandersnatch, unique from Zimmer's usual scores.I can see where some viewers didn't understand the dialogue - there are a lot of scenes where the characters are wearing masks and two scenes that are almost trolls that include the characters on windsurfers yelling at each other and characters dubbed in a very echo-y manner over backmasking. Additionally, half the cast has accented English and if you're not familiar with accents (Russian, French, Hindi, and Michael Caine) you might not be able to clearly understand what they're saying. On that note, Dimple Kapadia did a great job and I'm happy to see very famous Bollywood actors crossing over into Hollywood.Overall, 10/10, one of Nolan's best movies, and out of the Interstellar/Inception/Tenet sci-fi trio, I'd place it at the top or alongside Interstellar but superior to Inception."
1110,"Solid cast , brilliant premise. Disoriantating as hell but enjoy it its part of the ride"
1111,Good movie all you need to know. Extremely helpful review I know :)
1112,"I've never seen anything like TENET. The more I think about it, the more I make sense of each plot detail, the more I love it.Finally, we have a summer blockbuster that doesn't cater to a specific audience. After years of trudging through Marvel, Michael Bay, or Disney simply trying to appease or get by, we get a truly challenging and exciting movie going experience. Sure, stuff blows up, but Nolan, unlike his competitors, forces us to pay attention. He forces us to be engaged.And trust me, we'll be rewarded for it.The plot is simple enough, until it isn't. It's a James Bond story: a secret agent must stop a selfish foreign enemy from destroying the world by getting close to his hot wife. But there's a catch: time runs backwards sometimes. And it's one of the most original, well thought out concepts I've ever seenThe concept is explained well enough but following each character through the timeline, while also trying to keep up with the plot, is difficult. But afterwards, if you sit down, discuss it, make sense of it, things become clearer. That's when your eyes go wide again. That's when you gasp AGAIN. You already did when you watched it in the cinema. But when you understand it and you want to understand more and when you want to go back and see it again-you know the director has done their job.I love this movie. It challenged me in the audience while also delivering the thrills I expect from a summer blockbuster. It absolutely restored my faith in high budget moviemaking once again. It's exciting, new, and very complex. I can't wait to see it again."
1113,"First off, let me just say that no one should really be reviewing this movie after one viewing (which I am admittedly doing). I can guarantee the majority of opinions will drastically change after a second viewing. Much of this film is easily misunderstood and will require multiple viewings. This is Nolan's most complicated film to date. Though it is complex, there is a sense the film is not meant to be understood completely immediately. ""Don't try to understand it-feel it"", says one of the film's characters.The film feels high-paced from start to finish. Even scenes of calmer dialogue have quicker cuts and edits, giving a greater feeling to the dialogue vertigo this film already easily induces. To make things even more complicated, Nolan has overplayed much of the dialogue with score and sound mixing. Whether this is a grave mistake or a deliberate decision is yet to be understood. Point is, this film is hard to follow.I am confident Nolan is aware of the deep confusion his viewers will have. However, I am not sure if he is aware of the emotional distancing this creates between the characters and the viewers. Because the audience is playing ""catch-up"" to the plot for such an extended period of film time, it is hard to really invest into the characters. It takes an hour plus to finally see personal morals and feelings in the characters, thus letting the viewers invest more in the survival and well-being of the characters. Other than the plot being so complicated it is emotionally distancing, I have no honest complaint about this film.One of the most impressive feats of the film is its commitment to real photography and large outdoor sets. It is pure eye-candy. Nolan continues to baffle the ongoing film trends that suggest green-screening and CGI are adequate replacement for actual photography. It is films like this that make viewers agree more with the sentiment of Martin Scorsese, ""Marvel is not cinema"". I think a producer's worst nightmare is having to be in a Christopher Nolan story board meeting. If Nolan can imagine it, he can find a way to shoot it.The acting in the film pairs well with the writing. John David Washington does perfect as a sci-fi version of a quick-witted James Bond. Kenneth Branagh demonizes the villain brilliantly with his excellent balance of subtlety and bursts of aggression. Between these two underrated actors, the film's complicated plot is much more endurable.Though Hans Zimmer was not part of this movie, Ludwig Göransson substitutes in perfectly. The movie sounds and feels like a true Nolan project. From a viewer's standpoint, it even sounds like some of the sounds within the score are being played in reverse.Needless to say, this film falls in line with the rest of Nolan's films in regards to quality. Is it his best film? Probably not. But then again, only after audiences have viewed this film multiple times will there be a true decision on its legacy."
1114,"If you are a fan of Nolan's films as I am; if you have analyzed as many minute details in his films as I have; and if you are well aware of his use of paradox as a plot device, then this film is nothing new.Great visuals and editing, no argument there.However, the film is basically a mixture of Interstellar and Inception set in a paradox of space-time continuum.No surprises whatsoever.Even the ""plot-twist"" at the end is very obviously predicted.Great spectacle, but a predictable Nolan-flick.
Much better than Dunkirk, though."
1115,"TENET will be seen as a masterpiece in the future, just like Interstellar no one is fully prepared for this film. If you pay attention and get nearly most of the info that is given to you, you must connect the dots your self and once all the dots click. This film really treats you. Only problem is that I couldn't hear some of the dialogue, but that's it."
1116,"I kept thinking Tenet would probably be better the second time watching. I just saw Inception again and the film and story was amazing with characters I cared abut. I can't say the same thing about Tenet. I could not understand much of the dialogue. The story got a little better toward the end but without a fantastic story, all the stunts and special effects don't mean much."
1117,"John Washington does a great job acting, but what are they going off about. This movie was a waste of 2.5 hours."
1118,"Tenet is hands-down one of the best movies of the 21st century. Nolan does it again! It's mindbending, interesting and never loses your interest. The way the movie is told reminds me alot of ""Memento"". This movie is so masterfully complex, yet it becomes more logical with each time you watch it. You can easilly watch this 5 or 6 times, you'll always understand something new, but you'll never trully grasp the whole story.That's what excites me about this movie. Although it is Nolan's story, you still have room for your own theories about what the movie is all about.A must watch for anybody who enjoys mind-boggling movies"
1119,"THIS is his best film to date. Yes... the Joker may be his best character but this is his best film. This is the most fun I have had at a theatre in 20 years. There is more ""AHHA WOW!"" moments where you realize what is going on in a split second... its like seeing the ending of Split over and over or Sixth Sense. This I will be seeing AGAIN in theatres."
1120,"I am a huge Nolan fan and I think it would be difficult to disagree that he has staked his claim as the most influential and important filmmaker of the 21st century. And whilst I was desperate to write a review with the headline tenet out of tenet, I just couldn't.Whilst the concept is phenomenal the actual narrative is somewhat disappointing. It's hard to realise what we are rooting for, besides the obvious this guy is good and this guy is bad scenario. The driving forces that make inception and interstellar is the element of the protagonist being a father wanting to overcome something incredibly difficult for their child. Nolan throws this element in with a side-character/love interest in tenet and whilst we feel empathy for her because of her situation, she doesn't have to achieve the impossible to escape that situation. The protagonist and friend and great to watch but again, don't have much to fight for or prove - and how they hope to prevent a third world war using their specialist knowledge is unclear, which makes for an underwhelming ending to a promising build up.It's got a couple of phenomenal sequences, and the acting and casting choices were fantastic - but it's unfortunately anticlimactic with the only promise of something to lose coming in the form of a promised war (like the stakes of a superhero film). It's a good film. But on first viewing it falls short of the heights achieved in Nolan's previous works, but perhaps on a second viewing I will appreciate its intricacies more."
1121,"I found this movie to be very confusing as I did not feel as if what was actually going on was explained very well. For the most part of the movie I was trying to connect the dots, but not in a good way. I throughly enjoyed Inception and Interstellar as everything was explained appropriately, but Tenet was lacking in this area.
The cinematography, sound and special effects were on point though. Would wait until it is streaming on Netflix again to give it another go."
1122,"The plot is predictable,main actors horrible and and time invested to watch this is wasted.
There is no explanation why they made such a stupid movie,because,the plot is not that bad. The choice that black actor should be main character is probably made by some idiot ,because plot is in Europe,a where black people stick out like sore thumb,a and we all notice them and most of us like them very much."
1123,Brainless movie. I understand christopher nolan is known to come up with out-of-the-box movie concept but Tenet movie concept was really lame.
1124,"I can't quite believe this was a Christopher Nolan film. I don't know what went wrong. It had potential, but just left me angry that it was getting more and more confusing as time went on, and the things I wasn't understanding were piling up instead of being resolved. I couldn't hear what the actors were saying most of the time and about an hour before the film finished I realised I didn't actually care anymore. I was done rewinding trying to listen harder and I was done trying to understand everything. You have a feeling of wasted time trying to understand the plot, when there actually isn't any point in trying to understand when there is zero character development or much sense of caring from the characters themselves that the world is going to end... If they don't care why should I. People say you need to watch it twice, no I will not be doing that. You shouldn't have to either. Stars given for the beautiful scenery, nice visuals, good acting from the actors despite being let down with bad writing and audio and for the potential it had at the start of the film."
1125,"I cant figure out how the hell the audio mix passed the screen tests of this. Did Nolan want to try something different?Movies in which you have to increase volume on your TV when they speak and decrease it when the action starts I thought was something of the past until I saw this movieOn top of this, if we talk about Inception for abit, I belive a reason Inception was so succesful because it had a themed track which people loved that synergized with the movie done. This one did not it was just a lot of what I would call torture sounds playing. No melody or vibe feeling at allFix the audio mix and let Zimmer score this with a ""themed"" kind of track and it would have the same rating as InceptionThing ive learned from this movie is how much the audio and music matters because when its bad the entire film is ruined"
1126,"Too loud very much noise, i love the complicated stories but not this time."
1127,"I don't know how this movie have that rating, don't have a story just action. Too much people leave a cinema on the half of the movie so you know"
1128,"Mister Nolan, through this movie, has expressed a profound disdain to his audience.
I felt angry after watching this movie, it is a first. I wanted to be entertained, in stead, I was confused, it even managed to make me feel stupid, because I was unable to follow the events and unable to understand. It was just chaotic.
Furthermore, the choice of the lead actor was ill advised. It was a miscast. It was clear that he was reading his lines without any conviction or depth. As for the character itself, well, a Mary Sue.
I am deeply disappointed."
1129,I watched it at the cinema and most people came out halfway through the movie because it was very boring and stupid. I do not recommend it.
1130,"Saved only by the cinematography, and perhaps the acting. Some great dramatic scenes and quite polished, but the storyline .. well maybe I'm too old to qualify for the fantasy aspect, but it's too complicated and ""back and forth"". It's almost as if the writer/director/producer wants the mentally challenge you too much to enjoy it. Now, I love a tense exciting thinking drama, but this goes too far. There's no real depth to the story, so I gave up. I tried hard pushing myself through in the vain attempt to understand it, and 30 mins from the end I threw in the towel - you win director/writer/producer. Action - yes, involvement - no."
1131,"This movie bombed at the box office with good reasons....Maybe next time try not to make such a ""woke"" movie, and then maybe you will actually make a profit instead of a HUGE loss"
1132,"I like Christopher Nolan, and am a fan of his past work for the most part (besides Tom ""Mumbles"" Hardy playing a mumbling mad man, in pretty much every movie he's in...). But this film takes pretentious film making to another level.Convoluted story telling aside, the basics of this movie are woeful. Poor, wooden acting (the protagonist wears the same blank expression for the best part of 2 hours), action scenes and storylines weaving around nonsensically, a soundtrack thats below par for a Nolan film, and sound editing that makes large parts of dialogue incomprehensible. It all makes one wonder at what point did Nolan's head get jammed so far up his backside that he could no longer tell which way was up.I lost interest in this movie after about 30 minutes. And not because of the poor storytelling (the plot twist was almost apparent in the first scene, and definitely apparent in the first major fight scene...). Its just a complete mess of a movie, and very much style over substance. There's only so much empty style one can take before they decide to tune out.Not worth a first viewing, let alone a rewatch."
1133,I don't know how this movie was released in such condition!!! Moviegoers should be refunded their theater tickets money.
1134,Dont waste ur time watching this movie.it seems everybody is just making films about time travel. there is no beginning and ending to the movie. it is a movie without any story. eivom citehtap
1135,"Boring cause it doesn't make sense! I couldn't develop any genuine feelings for any of the characters not even Patterson. The characters don't have genuine feelings between each other. You can't tell who is fighting who, who is the enemy. What is the whole point of it all. You Cant follow the story line. Maybe have to watch it again but really what's the point nothing interesting to even try watching again."
1136,I've been told that I have to watch it more than once to get it. The logic in this movie was silly at times. It felt like one high tech heist after another with mumbled dialogue and choppy editing. Waste of money and not entertaining
1137,"The idea...FineThe right cast....FineWhats the Agenda...?Why,What,Who...?Waited for this a long time..So disapointedThanks to Corona so i didnt go to the Cinema and spent
2 1/2 hours on this Crap...."
1138,"I don't care it's Christopher Nolan, the movie for me was boring,weird,didn't understand and then I stoped trying to understand, I really tried for an hour and then turned it off... I gave it 2 stars just because of Robert Pattison..."
1139,"After the final edit they realised movie storyline and acting was atrocious.
Nolen : How to fix? Sound Engineer: Can set sound effects level = 10, soundtrack level = 11 and dialogue level = 1. Nolen : YESSSSSSSSS"
1140,"If you strip down all ""time"" effects you will get trivial and generic SAVING THE WORLD action movie. Subjects like: tracing bullet to supplier; weapons of mass destruction; villain arms dealer - are you serious? Frank Grillo is making 20 movies a year on this subject only for $2 mil.
Cinematography and aesthetics: nothing pleasing to see. Colors, costumes, scenery just not interesting. Road heist scene is flat boring. Final assault scene is to the level of mass production chinese actions.
Sound and music effects are unbearable.
You have to push yourself to finish this movie, and then you have to convince yourself that you didn't waste 2.5h."
1141,I tried to watch this movie. Only 15 mins watch! That's it! Couldn't watch it more. This is one of the worst movies all times. Don't waste your time.
1142,"If I had the time-machine from this movie I would return two and a half hours in the past and not watch it. Even if we close our eyes to pseudo-science mumbo-jumbo and plot holes, the dialogues were unconvincing, the characters completely unrelateble and storytelling - signature Nolan '""Let's make it confusing so it seems smart"". Yes, I did understand the story - but I cannot escape the feeling that it came into existence like ""Let' s make up a story to justify reverse actions scenes cause they look cool"". The actors were good, practical effects great, action scenes well done, but that's about it."
1143,"What pap, 10 out of 10 for the effects, (what little there is) 4 out of 10 for the codswallop story & drivel dialogue.
Slow, boring, uninteresting, stupid, all of these words would've been a far more appropriate title than ""tenet"".
Time travel has been the subject of many films & TV shows but here Nolan puts a twist on it, going backwards slowly or ""inversion"" ""reverse entropy"", interesting idea yet ultimately dull & boring, after watching Tenet it's clear why every aspect of this project had the highest of security & secrecy, had the details of this movie been leaked to the public they would have stayed clear of this mess of a movie, music score too loud just to hide the awful dialogue, sound effects of weapons & explosions loud & erratic so as to distract & confuse the viewer from realising how awful & messy the plot actually is."
1144,Didn't find this very enjoyable or particularly interesting. Not gonna make out like I'm some sort of high-minded movie connoisseur like other people on this site. It was rubbish. Who want to watch people fighting backwards anyway??
1145,"It started as an interesting action-time travel promise in the first 10 minutes. But after 20 more of chitchat, world menaces, future in for the kill, terrible sound and meaningless backwards motion fights, I got fed up with it.Next!"
1146,This movie is extremely hard to follow. Even after watching the explanation on YouTube it still doesn't make sense. I don't understand why he had to over complicate this film
1147,This is the first movie I saw in a movie theater in seven months. I loved it. Nolan's best film since Inception. It is about a guy who tries to stop the world from being destroyed by a time bending device. This film has battles where characters move forward and backwards in time at the same time. The cast is great. The action is awesome. The plot is very hard to follow. This is a nearly three hour long movie but I was never once bored. It's not a film with a lot of deep character development but it never pretends that it is. It's just a super unique crazy bold cinematic experience.
1148,"It just wasn't up to par on the first viewing. Not sure who is rating this film as high as 9 or 10.I will give it a second chance in the future, but on first viewing I won't be recommending it. The lead character didn't seem like he fit into the role well, Denzel would've done it so well or Idris Alba. That mother who kept having to remind us she had a son (we only glimpsed) wasn't particularly convincing either. Patterson did well though! Branagh was good as a villain, if a tad cliche and shallow. Generally, who ever casted this was on something.The plot was way to convoluted. It took too much effort to understand the back and forth time frames, inverted time is what they called it. Felt gimmicky.Great action scenes, and good photography though."
1149,"Very confusing, need a lot of background knowledge to understand the movie. Will not watch it again"
1150,"Right down to the use of a palindrome as a title, TENET tries hard to believe in itself, but all the backwards footage and circling conversations do is end up reminding the viewer of the improbability of the concept in a way that Interstellar and Inception successfully avoided. The self-fulfilling plot devices continue on and on until the villain's motive-reveal party, which although was clearly one for the 'you almost caught me monologue-ing' record books, could not be understood above the din of Dolby's desire to produce seat shaking sound.
Hollywood complications aside, with TENET you can't even let suspension of disbelief develop in action-movie-mode because Nolan seems completely disinterested in making TENET live up to his own standards. Honestly, the movie's climatic fight scene seemed to be gathered from the cutting room floor of a 1970s era James Bond film... It was made-for-TV awful.Why even five stars? I could say some are due to the gratitude for being back in a movie theatre (to be one of three at a 6:00 pm showing was its own experience) but the stars are earned by Washington who demonstrates the chops to make the shortlist for inheriting the Bond franchise. Add to his screen-presence a charismatic bromance with Pattinson and a #metoo appropriate approach to Debicki and it is clear to see you don't need a second viewing to understand what Nolan is trying to show you."
1151,"Frankly, to choose this movie in my playlist had only one reason - Christopher Nolan and on top of that, written and directed by him. And I also know, when it comes to him, he is master of getting work out from Characters, Screenplay and execution of the script.If it's not an adapted theory like The Dark Knight, it is definitely experimental and he has made a place in proving his theory; either time or quantum theory, dreams or showing a movie in both forward and backward direction. And as the theory prevails, this movie works on time inversion and you really need a lot of energy and dedication to understand what he really wants to emphasize.Let me jump to the pros and cons; as per my understanding:Pros:Theory of Inversion is depicted in a beautiful manner and apparently, we come across the cases when you start understanding what it was really all about, if you really had jotted down the earlier events in the movie.The mystery binds you till core and you remain to the edge of your seat.Only Nolan can think on how portray a character so that he speaks his lines backward and them to make sense.Overall, a totally original idea. At-least i had never come across any such instance where this concept is used before.Cons:Character building is an important factor in any movie and i had seen in his earlier movies, it was done in an appropriate and crisp way. In here, i felt it lagged behind and it became hard to correlate as to the overall reason of something happening. Or why a character want to do something.The background score could have been better.If the inversion theory worked at its level best, some places i found it required a little more garnishing. And because it is Nolan, so i am strict in apprehending this case.Overall, bravo to the creator and direction, and an original idea which came to us."
1152,"Tone, Script & Story: A world where time inversion is possible through entities like things and living beings has to be stopped from bringing its own halocaust.If time inversion exists & time travel doesn't then how two different instances exists. There is algorithm that needs to be contained but how movie unfolds stays unclear. Some ideas involving paradoxes along storyline entertain.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Well this area excels. The action & reverse sequences are delight to watch. Music: Average. Acting: Average.Final Verdict: For the first time I think Nolan's work is underrated. It's a good action sci-fi thriller. Will re-review if perspective alters after watching it again."
1153,"Actually, I am quite certain I liked it. Though, I am sure I will appreciate it a lot more once I've given it a few run throughs. Perhaps by the third watching, my mind will un-pretzel itself to what is actually happening and when. Also, I will be watching with subtitles! Trying to hear the dialogue, especially when it is trying to explain what is going on was next to impossible. The sound mixing with the dialogue made it that much harder to follow.That being said, Nolan pulled no punches. He was all in on this one, and if it could be described in one sentence... ""The most Nolany film ever"". If that makes sense? It has that feel that all his recent films in the last 15 years have had. The whole concept is very ambitious, which Hollywood needs more of. The cinematography was great, it gives you this grand scale of the world. The effects were also great, especially the middle action heist sequence. I loved seeing Robert Pattison in a huge role where he could actually show how talented he is. Some seem to still be stuck on the whole Twilight era and not realize he has been phenomenal in so many roles since then. Was excited to see John David Washington since Blackkklansman, and he did not disappoint.Missed Hans Zimmer though."
1154,"I thought the quality of audio was bad because of the cinema I went to. Then I found out it was actually Nolan messing with the sound on purpose just so we don't understand the dialogues. If that's somehow supposed to be considered artistic, then I want to spend the rest of my life as a caveman. F*** that.I'm never going to pay to see another Nolan movie."
1155,"Bombastic music and dialog delivered while actors wear masks (and not for health reasons)make this confusing, overlong film even more unintelligible for me."
1156,"Both interesting and challenging to watch.
I was entertained enormously!"
1157,"No spoilers.From the beginning to about 1/3 of the movie, everything looks very Nolan style, but a little bit more free and casual in terms of camera and editing. And I thought, ok, so what's so special?Then the middle third absolutely blew my mind away. How the hell did he come up with this idea and executed to such perfection?And then when I made it to the end of the movie, it was done in such perfection. Nolan has once again proved that he's the number one director in the world.No one else can come up with such an original idea, weave such a convoluted movie so full of character depth, and execute everything to such perfection.2020 is the year we learned that Christopher Nolan and Elon Musk are both from another planet."
1158,"This movie feels like a bland copy of a Christopher Nolan movie, like someone who watched a few of his movies tried to write one, without really understanding the soul of his movies.Tenet is interesting, but not enough to justify the usage of inversion. It adds nothing great to the plot (the plot itself also being boring with a few twists here and there that in the end don't matter that much).
Characters were done really bad. I know this sounds really cliche, as everyone says that about this movie, but it is absolutely true. Tenet avoids any character development, and instead it focuses on the plot and the concept, which, as I said previously, aren't that good or interesting.
The main mistake a piece of writing can make (novel, short story, movie, TV series...you name it) is, in my opinion, not developing the characters. It gets to the point where you don't even care about them. If they were killed you wouldn't mind...at all.
Tenet makes that mistake.All in all, I'm left with the impression that this could have worked better as a TV series. That way, there would be more time to develop the characters and also more time to explore the concepts."
1159,I think it's the worst movie in the history of Christopher Nolan career! The actors were bad and the script was weak!
1160,"Its cool, but Nolan want us to think. You know like Interstellar kind of movie. I'm glad I have a friend who is so into physic so I can understand Interstellar. But for Tenet. My friend need some time to process it before start explaining to me about his theory. Need to wait for some deep movie thinker to solve this puzzle for me. The action is good, but dont really understand it. Physic stuff I guess. I'm into history, Dunkirk kind of man."
1161,"Non-spoiler.Stunningly original and woven with sublime intricacy, Christopher Nolan's action-thriller abounds with incredible set-pieces and a delightfully tricky storyline that showcases his skill at creating coherent worlds filled with the wildest of concepts. Cinematographic brilliance from Hoyte van Hoytema and some standout tracks from Ludwig Goransson complete the mystique and wonderfully unique atmosphere and contribute to an undoubtedly technically masterful film.Tenet is severely lacking in character development, with little emotional engagement that is not generated by the superb portrayals by Pattinson, Washington and Debicki. Character motivations are also veiled and frustratingly shallow and unexplored. Beyond this, the plot suffers from a lack of clarity in the final act, and a general reliance on exposition.This is a movie that focuses on the power of it's intriguing concepts and it's intricately threaded plot, weaving a remarkably tense and gripping narrative, pulling on Nolan's trademark skill of foreshadowing and set-up to create a film which rewards the viewer for their close attention.Not for everyone, and by no means his best.8.7/10 for me as a Nolan fan and lover of puzzle-box plots, objectively would lower that to 8/10."
1162,"Not as good as I'd hoped it would be, but still above standard, as you would have expected from Nolan.This film has a very smart concept. It's super original, but it's quite complex. And, if you're not paying attention, you'll probably end up walking out of the cinema confused. It's definitely not for casual viewers. I suspected that is why the film doesn't have higher ratings.The casts are good. Robert Pattinson played his character pretty well, but his character could had been developed more. John David Washington is great as the lead. Never watched any of his film before, so I didn't know what to expect. At first, I find him to be too plain for the role, but as the story progressed, he turned out to be quite charming.The ending of the film felt a bit anticlimactic. I was expecting an ending that is unpredictable and left me wanting more like Inception. This one didn't make me feel like that at all, but nevertheless, it was good overall. I probably need to see it again though."
1163,"Not my favorite of Nolan's films, but his most mind-boggling one. I had to think harder and pay more attention watching it than in any other movie I can remember. As the plot progresses you start to piece everything together until it ALMOST makes sense and then something throws you for a loop again. Which is a good thing. I wanted to watch it again as soon as it ended."
1164,"SPOILER FREEI absolutely LOVE Christopher Nolan's past movies, and appreciate how he can take very ""out of the box"" thinking and storytelling, and make it come together in a neat and well explained package by the end. That has been his strength as a master story teller thus far. Unfortunately the usual build, and execution was not present in this film. Here are the issues:1. Intriguing opening scene, that falls apart with excessive cuts to new locations/characters without any real explanation2. Too many scenes were done for the visual aesthetic, even though they ended up convoluting the plot (blue boat scene, early tower scene, and others)3. Poor sense of who the characters were, and the specific motivations they were supposed to have. Yes the characters say ""I care about X"" but it is not believable, it's just a phrase that is thrown around to cover the bare essentials of character development. Attraction between characters seems to come out of nowhere and be unfounded4. Poor acting by the lead. He seemed very wooden over all and not serious in the role.5. Terrible sound quality. There are MANY characters with heavy accents that are not picked up clearly and honestly just sound like they are speaking nonsense. This is mainly due to the accents, the speed that the person is speaking, the excessive background noise that makes hearing anything hard, and the topics generally being so crazy that you don't have time to process what is being said because you are straining to hear anything in the first place.6. Confusing for confusion's sake. Early in the movie there are an extreme number of random ""hoops"" and contacts that need to be jumped through, and ultimately are COMPLETELY unnecessary. More time should have been spent explaining the core concept better, rather than creating a slew of pointless characters and contacts that have no real importance other than being a vehicle for visuals (windmills, tower scene, etc).There are also many strengths to this film:1: The core concept is FASCINATING and a clearer picture of it would have made this a rival for potentially unseating Inception as Nolan's ""most mind blowing"" Film2. Robert Pattinson was very good, and easily the best actor in this film and ended up doing a lot of the heavy lifting character development wise3. The action scenes are mesmerizing to watch. Definitely confusing as you try to process what is going on, but also what you see is beautiful chaos4. Cinematography and visuals as always were spectacular, and this film is very pleasant to look at 95% of the time"
1165,"Christopher Nolan has a formula for action films to keep you paying attention. It is similar to what classical composers would do. Every so often during a symphony, they would add a loud passage to make sure the audience was awake. In the case for Nolan, he would throw in a punchy moment of action every so often to keep the adrenaline rush going.This worked in spades in ""The Dark Knight"". Remember when there was some expository dialogue in the mayor's office and BAM!, a dead guy in a batman outfit slams against the glass. That kind of loud and abrupt moment catches your attention. Oooh! Something new happened! That formula requires something new and interesting to happen every minute or so. Which seems ridiculously a lot. And it is. But as long as that new thing posed some new interest regarding the story (Our villain is also a victim!), the train's firebox gets fed another shovel full of coal.This also worked well for Inception, where the audience was willing to invest their curiosity in the world of invading other people's dreams. The layering of plots went along with the layering of dream-within-a-dream in such a way that we could keep track of what was going on.However, for Tenet, the next exciting plot point becomes hard to follow sometimes. It is a twist on the time travel concept that I was barely able to keep up with. And I am an enthusiast in the concept of understanding the metaphysics of time. It is my understanding that there is a device that can flip the flow of time, and you can travel backwards in time (in real time) while the world around you still flows forward.It is a neat enough concept to be for a potentially intriguing movie. But I think it was not exploited enough. There is a brief introduction to the concept near the beginning of the film, one fight scene in the middle, and then a more extended use of the concept at the end. So there is a major chunk of the film, primarily in the middle, where we set aside all the science fiction aspects of the plot.What we get instead is a globe trotting adventure that smoothly, James Bond style, jumps from one exotic location to the next, for seemingly no other reason than to have an interesting backdrop while propelling the story. But in the meantime, the plot thickens to the degree that one starts to lose track of what's going on. And I was paying attention. For some reason the concept set forth in Inception was explained well enough, or perhaps kept to few enough layers, to keep track of what was going on. I think one problem with ""Tenet"", is that there is a need to keep the dialogue about what's going on more subtle, which is honorable. But unlike Inception, either too much convolution is going on, or it needed to be explained a little better. I think the former more that the latter.Our supporting characters continue to evolve, almost to the point we are in a different movie than we started with. Even more so when with some of the moments are revisited (via the time travel angle). So, even though the runtime on Nolan movies typically go well over two hours, the quick pace and steady flow of action makes up for it. In this case, however, the big third act feels like it arrives late.This movie was the first time I had been in a movie theater in about 8 months. It was a strange feeling (the showing I went to was a matinee and there were only a handful of people there). But more so, it was the sterile feeling about everything that made it feel less like going out to the movies that in the past. It was kind of too bad that the first movie I watched wasn't a hit out of the ballpark.As much as this movie invites us to rewatch the film to catch the nuances perhaps missed in the first viewing, I am reluctant to do so until I am ready to sit through this long and complicated event film."
1166,"Tenet is not an accessible film at first glance, which may be its biggest flaw but also potentially its most redeeming and enduring quality; it dares to be different against all odds.Nolan's latest entry grants only the most stolid and doggedly determined viewers the right to absorb its dense esoteric subject matter, material folded over itself multiple times again, like finely assembled origami.
Beset with sound mixing issues, an at times impassive tone, and a concept that almost foists a quantum physics tome into its viewers hands, and a tome on Greek mythology too, for good measure - the motion picture explores the very 'motion' of the picture, leaving behind the casual many that are unable to keep up with its higher-brow exposition. One line that sums it up is there's a ""technology that can reverse an object's entropy"". On first viewing, it's perhaps better felt than understood.Well-cast Robert Pattinson as The Protagonist's (John David Washington) sidekick, Neil is a suave, fairly louche character. He is rather contrasted by Washington's steely character, who has moments of wit and muted panache coming through, although not often enough to be truly felt. Michael Crosby (Michael Caine) makes a brief, but standout performance. Kat (Elizabeth Debicki) also shows notable acting flair, caught in the eye of the storm of the plotline.Nolan took more than five years to write the screenplay after deliberating about Tenet's central ideas for over a decade, so it's abundantly clear that some significant thought went into this project. The very title word 'Tenet' is a palindrome and a reference to the 4-way symmetrical Sator Square, the oldest datable representation of which was stunningly found in the ruins of Pompeii (a location referenced in the film). Numerous references to the occult square feature throughout the film, with each word of the square holding significant meaning in various areas.'Sator', the surname of the antagonist arms dealer Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh) is a reference to 'Saturn', and is a word of the Sator Square. It refers to Cronus or Chronos, the personification of time. Cronus maintains the course and cycles of seasons and the periods of time. This mirrors the role that Andrei Sator plays in the plot, as an arch manipulator of time. Cronus represented the destructive ravages of time which devoured all things, a concept that was illustrated when the Titan king ate the Olympian gods - the past consuming the future, the older generation suppressing the next generation. As shown in Sator's conflict with his estranged wife over custody of his son. The wider plot is an allegory for this great conflict between the future and the past, colliding at every moment without us realizing it, deciding the fate of 'posterity'. A jealous Cronus and the mythological theme of castration features, as the metaphor for vanquishing posterity (the future) runs deep through the plotline.The score departs from Zimmer's brand of expertise, exploring instead the pulsating, roaring, mechanically crashing sounds of Ludwig Göransson's fierce, and at times, tender, effort. The soundtrack, by many people's accounts, drowns out parts of the dialogue; almost seemingly a trap expertly placed by Nolan and his sound team in order to beckon a second, more detailed, viewing with subtitles. And that you should.8.3/10"
1167,"I am reviewing this movie after one watch and I have to say I quite liked it, and I do think I understood most of the key premises. I may have missed a few of the smaller details, which I hopefully will pick up on a re-watch. However, I went with two other people who did not get this movie and absolutely hated it. This is why you have to give this movie your full attention, because if not you will lose track of what is happening and be miserable for the next two hours. Also, I am an American and native English speaker, so I don't know how difficult it would be to watched this movie subtitled or dubbed. I like foreign movies, but I do know the negative of missing a line of dialogue, camera set-up, or movement from an actor because you have to so quickly read the subtitles. This causes me to be afraid that you will miss a lot if you are from a non-english speaking country, but I hope this is not the case.
""Tenet"" is both a philosophical science fiction movie and a complex thriller. I would say this makes it harder to understand than previous Nolan movies such as ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Inception,"" because those movies had traits of being a super-hero or heist movie which are genres audiences are more familiar with.
I think I am done talking about the complexities and would like to talk about the pros of this movie. The cast, except for Brannagh who is good not great, does a really good job with making characters with very little characterization, which is a con I will talk about, feel real. An example of this is some of Washington's humor. He is not a funny character, but he makes some smart aleck responses which makes his cold character feel more human. Overall, Washington and Pattinson were very good casting choices. Another pro is the choreography. This movie's action scenes are incredibly unique and the spectacle of seeing them are amazing. A subject related to this is Nolan's use of motion/blocking in a frame. Nolan as a director has a lot of movement in his scenes, whether they be actions or exposition scenes, which makes exposition scenes, which there are several of, be much more interesting than they would be by a lesser director. The payoffs of this movie. I would say there are scenes from earlier in this movie that you end up appreciating a lot more about 2/3rds of the way through, which makes me appreciate the earlier scenes a lot more.
The cons. I don't like being negative and I do like that Nolan is making blockbusters that are nothing like any other blockbusters around, but ""Tenet"" does have a few flaws. The characterization, I praised the cast earlier, but I think they did a great job with the little amount of character they had. The script gives very little time to the characters to allow them develop as people. Mainly because, it is so focused on moving the plot forward. I do think that the movie could have been a little bit better if it added about 15 minutes of characterization besides the plot, so we could care more about the characters in the epic situations they are in. The sound is a major problem. You may read other reviews criticizing the sound, and these views are correct. The sounder mixer and Nolan put too much emphasis on the sound effects and score. This leads to you being unable to hear the dialogue at points. This is a real negative because the dialogue is so important. I am younger and my hearing is probably better than the average person's, but if you are in your forties, fifties, or older this may be a real problem which SHOULD have been avoided. I am hoping that this problem will be re-mixed either while it is still in theatres or before it goes onto blu-ray and digital, because it is inexcusable. My final con is that it is too big at times. ""Tenet"" is one of the most massive movies of all time. It is up there with ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""Ran,"" ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" and ""Avengers: Endgame."" This leads to there being great spectacle, but sometimes it is a little too much. I will give a non-spoiler example. There is a scene where Washington does pull-ups inside a windmill, at a deadly height if he falls. I get what this scene is saying in terms of his character, but sometimes just how huge it is separates us from the characters.
I'm impressed if you are still reading this, but don't worry I will end it soon. I hated going on about the cons for so long, because I really liked this movie. I like Nolan as a director, but I was really disappointed in ""Interstellar"" and ""Dunkirk,"" but I would re-watch ""Dunkirk"" to see if I like it more (I have watched ""Interstellar"" twice and just was never into it). ""Tenet"" was the first time for awhile that I felt I was watching the incredible Nolan who made ""The Dark Knight Trilogy."" So, please I understand if you don't watch this in theatres because of the pandemic, I felt really nervous and went to a Wednesday showing. However, whenever you can watch it and feel safe, please don't be scared off because you heard from a friend or the internet that this is complicated, this movie really deserves a watch."
1168,"At this point, when a Christopher Nolan film comes out, it's a must see in theaters. So once again with Tenet, he delivers a completely unique and original story.Out of all Christoper Nolan's movies, this one is the most ""Christopher Nolan"". Nolan continues to use time as a driving point of a film. The film starts out running and does not stop, so sit back and just take in what you can. As the film progresses, more and more of the story starts to click in your mind, but you may never fully pick up everything until after it is over.I personally didn't know how I felt about Tenet once the film finished, but I knew I was extremely engaged. The film has terrific action and a wonderful score by Ludwig Göransson. All of the acting is great, especially by John David Washington and Robert Pattinson. My biggest complaint with the film is the sound mixing in it. There are many moments throughout the movie where the score and sound effects overpower the dialogue, which makes the movie more confusing than it already is. With that being said, it's been almost three days now since I saw it, and I can't stop thinking about the movie.I feel quite confident that during the release of the film, it will be quite divisive, with some people hating it and others loving it. With time though, I really think this movie will be considered a masterpiece once it's been digested and looked back upon."
1169,"For real though. That was the most confusing movie I've ever watched. Christopher Nolan's Inception was mind-bending as well, but I kind of processed the plot as the movie progressed pretty smoothly. With Tenet, I was lost. I could barely hear the actor's voices let alone process the complexity of this film. Part of it I think is that I've never watched a movie where the past and present were intertwining like that so I was confused throughout the movie. I really don't mind and even really admire Nolan's complex plots, but in a 150 min movie, by the first 30 mins, I expect to understand the basic plot. With Tenet, that happened around minute 130."
1170,"I was in awe for about 30 minutes with the action and non-computer generated special effects. The 747 crashing into the building is amazing. But then I got a headache trying to follow the plot. Finally, I just gave up and watched the action.A great action sequence at the end in a battle with forces moving forward in time accompanied by others moving backward in time attacking the same target.Next time I need to see it with subtitles because the dialogue is muddled even in a real movie theatre with high volume sound.Definitively a challenging film to watch. And I DO want to see it again"
1171,"Just saw it at IMAX. If YOU CAN SEE AT ON IMAX, DO IT.Some of the scenes--even static ones--are simply breathtaking on the huge IMAX screen in a way that wouldn't I think translate to a smaller screen.Anyway, this is most definitely a Nolan movie--the cinematography is top-notch as always and the whole thing has a moody, weird, altered state reality vibe that's most reminiscent of ""Inception"". The time and science angle is more reminiscent of ""Interstellar"".And boy oh boy does this movie start with a bang. I don't think it's even 30 second in before all hell breaks loose.That said, while the action sequences are insane and the backwards-moving scenes are something you've never seen before, it's almost a Bond film in that the heroes are trying to stop the Russian bad guy from unleashing a doomsday device. That's really the gist of it.The backwards/forwards thing sometimes makes sense, but often times I got lost and decided just to roll with it, to ""feel"" it was one character says. I'm guessing the more views, the more this movie will make sense and those are the *best* kind of movies. I can say, having seen it just hours ago, that you can't stop thinking about it.Minuses: like every Nolan film, it's 30 minutes too long. The final battle scene is often confusing and chaotic--and long. Not quite as tight and easy-to-follow as the end of Inception. There's a lot of monologues that could have been trimmed. It can get extremely complicated (kind of like Interstellar did if you don't know anything about relative time). If you know the TV show ""Dark"" it can get that complex.But oh, how it looks. Again, see it on IMAX if you can."
1172,"This is a very confusing film. As it goes on things begin to clear up and make scence. It will definitely take a few more viewings to fully understand everything that's going on. The acting and plot are all very good and the action scenes are great. The effects are also spectacular, and just about all of it is done practically without any cgi. Besides The Dark Knight, this is without a doubt Nolan's best film. A very complex and intriguing action movie."
1173,This could be the first movie ever that I watch from start to end without having slightest clue of what the fuss is all about . My only takeaway is that Kenneth Branagh is getting fat !
1174,"I went to see this film, full of expectation. Firstly, after the long cinema closures it was good to be a cinema goer again. Secondly, a promised reopening with a highly built up film from the Director of Inception, was certainly going to be worth donning a mask for.
Well, it wasn't. The storyline was faulty, the tooing and froing causing initial confusion, which evolved into complete boredom before the final scenes arrived.
The film came across as a feeble attempt at hitting a highly complex sci-fi action thriller with a mesh mash of crazy, unrealistic ideas.
Not worth going out for."
1175,"Nolan's films are works of art, meant for multiple viewings, and I appreciate that about him. (He directed my favorite film, Memento, and films like Inception and The Dark Knight are high on the list, too.)I didn't find the time-chronology elements confusing, because I'm already accustomed to thinking that way. What was harder for me were the political and interpersonal interweavings, but you see the same sort of thing in many political action dramas. Just leaves room for plenty of rewatchings!Bold move, making the main character nameless, so you care much less about him than a Cobb or a Leonard Shelby, but I think this helped keep the film more abstract. After all, it's a work of art."
1176,Nolan does it again. We all knew he would. Go in blind and keep the brain on. You won't be disappointed.
1177,"There's a ballfield of opinions on director Christopher Nolan, one of the most honored working today and especially for his unapologetic ambitions and unconventional storytelling: Those that think everything up to Inception is the end of the line in terms of quality, those that believe everything up to The Dark Knight Rises is it, those that love everything he does regardless of how good it is, those that only appreciate his individual films or early prospects, those that think he's overrated to terrible, so and so forth. I've been prodigiously impressed by most of his films to date, even his lower efforts Insomnia and Following that are still prestinely made. Tenet falls into the latter category right between those two just mentioned; style over substance, maddening, but you can't take your eyes off of it.The Protagonist, played by John David Washington of recent Blackkklansman fame, is the mirror of the audience in this journey of preventing a nuclear holocaust and navigating through a wave of international espionage to do so. With the territory comes the fact that his backstory isn't elaborated on as much; he doesn't have time to reflect on his life or past memories, but the mission and his strive to do good keeps us engaged. John's performance is strong for what he has to work with, body-language driven but also witty and shrewdly tuned. He of course doesn't hold a candle to most of Nolan's other heroes- Interstellar's Joseph Coop and by extension his wonderful daughter Murph, Inception's Dom Cobb, Bruce Wayne/Batman and even Leonard Shelby. Robert Pattinson is irresistible as Protagonist's partner Neil, determined as all hell but also funny. Nolan's regular acting confidante Michael Caine has a small but important role, his most notable scene is imbedded with some British humor (contrary to the IndieWire review that labeled this film ""humorless""; seriously, would you use that in a criticism of a Scorsese or Malick movie?). Kenneth Branaugh gives it his all as the antagonist Andrei Sator, whose sinister presence and bits of backstory are thankfully given time to shine. Like our hero though, he doesn't shine as much to Nolan's other excellent villains who have much more character, and his motives are somewhat unintelligible. The best performance is Elizabeth Debicki's Kat, who in some ways being the deuteragonist is an emotionally resonant balance to John David Washington. She needs to be rescued at times, but nonetheless has plenty to do and contributes in battling the main threat to the preservation of humanity. Himesh Patel, Dimple Kapadia and Aaron Taylor-Johnson also have notable presences, though nothing too much comes of them except for Aaron's towards the end.With Nolan breaking his tradition of usual cinematic reference points for this film, instead this plays somewhat like a Christopher Nolan's Greatest Hits Collection, as somewhat suggested by the second theatrical trailer. There's dating back to the timeline breaking mechanics of Memento, good vs evil in an elaborate and constantly shifting world like in The Dark Knight Trilogy (and another terrifically staged plane crash sequence to add), and of course Inception. This is visually astonishing and dense; if repeat viewings become your gig with this, then I bet there will be many things to gaze at in the time inversion sequences. It makes for some breathtaking action and fighting set-pieces, the sound design adds to how hard the punches are felt and the practicality; including an astonishing battlefield sequence. The score by Ludwig Goransson continues Nolan's usual streak with his composers, (The Dark Knight Rises, Inception and Interstellar being the best for my money).If you thought that some of his other films like Inception were too complicated, then you'll probably not enjoy this, which makes everything else that came before for Nolan seem like a day at the office. I don't know yet how it will shape in his filmography, but this is by far one that's probably the hardest to grasp. I never had an issue understanding his films nor their sound, even with the enhancements from IMAX technology, but Tenet is the exception to that because a good amount of the dialogue and scenes were hard to follow with the pouncing score and sound design. I hope that he'll improve on this in his next project if he decides to continue this hail mary experiment.Given the current state of the theater business and how much our culture is shifting, a good getaway to the movies is just what many have been wishing for. Tenet might not be the one we deserve, but the one that's needed. Perplexing and worthy of his slate despite being a lesser outing.Grade- B/3 out of 4 stars."
1178,"Tenet is good, but not as good as it thinks it is. It's basically a Roger Moore era bond film with most of the humour and sex taken out, and an over intrusive (and not very good) score.There is a layer of wibbly, wobbly timey wimey stuff smeared over the top, which provides most of the fun, and some good twists and turns, and some great set pieces. There are some good performances, the hero is likeable (he'd make a good first black bond, if he wasn't a Yank) and Michael Caine gets to play a character called Sir Michael, which made me smile.I was the only person there other then one other couple, but the afternoon showings I favour are generally fairly quiet. Hope it does well, as I know cinemas are relying on it too bring people out again. It is worth seeing, even if the music is a bit rubbish (given they were ripping off bond so much they should have taken a leaf from live and let die). Nolan should get David Julyan back."
1179,"I thought it was just my theater but lots of reviews here saying the same thing. Posting this hoping ""they"" see it and release a fixed version but I'm guessing that won't happen?How do you spend $200M on a movie and release it with an awful mix?Anyway, I loved the soundtrack but couldn't hear a word whenever the music was going. Subtitles definitely required.Advice for anyone considering this movie: probably best to wait for Blu-ray unfortunately."
1180,"Nolan has outnolaned himself. If that sentence doesn't make complete sense, then neither does the movie.The premise is paper thin. Dialogues are muffled to make them 'immersive', amidst full blown music and gunfires, a guy is talking from under a mask. Even though the story is confusing, the twists, if you can call them that, are predictable.Cinematography is pretty good, Nolan has big budgets. Action sequences are top notch. The leads did a good job as well. You will need to watch it a few times to make complete sense. But what for? The movie is intentionally made in a way to showcase the vision and brilliance of Nolan rather than it being a requirement of the plot. Too clever by half"
1181,"I am a big fan of Nolan movies, but this one is unfortunately a big mess. The pictures and the action of this movie are pretty good. But the plot has too many holes and is on many points way to predictable.In addition, why is 2020 in most of the US movies still the russians the bad guys? Because they dont have the community to protest against it? Or they just dont care? I dont know... But what I notice is that Hollywood movies nowadays are just a mirror of the societal and political climate."
1182,"Story was weird, human relationships felt artificial and most disappointingly movie lacks spectacular scenes. Even the plane crush scene was disappointing. Watching a fight scene in reverse isn't that interesting imo and that movie is all about that. I hope next Nolan movie gets as good as his previous movies."
1183,"Tenet is a fast-paced action movie with Sci-Fi elements. It is driven by great visuals and superb acting, particurlarly by Robert Pattinson (Neil), Elizabeth Debick (Kat) and Dimple Kapadia (Priya). It plays with a different type of time device than usual time-travel movies. Due to this effect the story seems often complex and very sophisticated. In actuality, Tenet moves at such a speed that you have little time to really understand and also question the use of the time device. On leaving the cinema you are likely to be overwhelmed with the many puzzles that the movie throws at you and this can give you the impression that the movie is complex and ""deep"". This impression leads to the artificial divide between insiders who ""just get it"" and the rest. Yet, when you sit down and think about it, it may dawn on you that many of the essential aspects of the time device are just glossed over and many of the scenes do not really add to the movie itself, but just create artificial complexity. If the makers of the movie had spend more time on really showing the limits of the time device, this could have been a much better movie. Instead it suffers from similar fates as many time-travel movies: You are allowed to go back in time to fix things, only if you already did it, which begs the question of how this could have happened in the first place. To this usual dilemma the movie adds many more problems. The largest one is that of all human activity breathing is affected by the time device, while everything else apparently is not."
1184,"It may be confusing at first but as you venture more into the movie,you start to understand or you can say feel it.Great cinematography by Nolan as expected with basically no CGI, which really is impressive to see in an action packed film. It's a Terrific movie and I'd recommend you watch it with full concentration to really get the feel of it."
1185,"I'm a pretty big fan of Nolan's work, but after seeing this for the first time I'm a bit disappointed. The dual timeline thing is hard to really follow in a single viewing. I imagine that if you watch it more than once you could probably even follow the backward dialogue and it would all fall into place but a bit more, but I just don't feel like watching it again. Reversed entropy just doesn't fly at all. Interstellar makes sense (for the most part at least), Tenet doesn't make any sort of sense at all.People who read subtitles are going to miss out, no matter how many times they watch it.I think this is one of Nolan's worst movies. It's new, but not really a in a good way."
1186,"Now I'm not going to pretend I understood a lot of what was going on... the film demands 100% of your concentration (and then some) and re-watches are almost entirely required to get a full understanding of this demanding story but the sheer scope and ingenuity on show here is nothing short of breathtaking.
With an already astounding track record, Nolan once again cements himself as one of the most creative, adaptable, daring and exciting directors of all-time."
1187,"Not only did this movie pretty much save cinema, but it also redefined the word cinema forever. The writing, performances, cinematography, vfx and score are all brilliant. The only very minor things I would take from this are the following.The first thing would be that the background noise was a bit too loud which made it hard to hear the characters speaking.The second thing would be that the plot was a bit convoluted.Apart from that this is a perfect film. Christopher Nolan has outdone himself again.One more thing, I ordered hot sauce half an hour ago!"
1188,"No doubt that this is a Christopher Nolan movie and it is fantastic , full of action and plot twists with terrific sound and very good scenes but yet i wasn't surprised much at the end like i was in Interstellar .. the point is that for me the movie was very predictable at moments compered to others of his ."
1189,"I saw Tenet today in London nd I have to say that I was profoundly bored. Yes, there are good action scenes but inbetween these scenes (which aren't even that great) there are many boring moments. All the little puzzles does not maketh a good nor interesting film. Like I was thinking throughout 'who cares?' The 'villain' was a total cartoonish stereotype, and the plot stupid. I did not feel for one second that the world was truly in danger. The characters go forward in time then backwards then forward again then backwards, inverted, reverted, inverted again, you get the picture. It seems like the special effects are more important than the characters and the plot itself. I didn't like any of the characters btw, except perhaps Robert Pattinson's. I actually went to see the film because I quite like his recent films and enjoy his acting. He was good in this, although I imagine it was a walk in the park for him as there was nothing 'difficult' about his role at all. The protagonist was 'so so'. I don't blame the actor, as he didn't have much to chew on...because what's paramount in the film are the action scenes and the special effects. The 'dame in distress' was a total bore, and it was not believable that the 'protagonist' would even care about her as much as he did. It also didn't help that sometimes it was too dark to see properly, and that the sound was muffled and you could not make out what the characters were saying. I'm giving it a 5/10 because it has some okay scenes. So would I recommend it? It depends. If you are a Nolan nutter who thinks he urinates gold, yes, go ahead, you'll love it. If however you are into more character driven, brilliant acting and cinematography, and more arty type of films, no, because you won't be impressed. Perhaps dubbed into another language by charismatic actors, maybe it would even make the film more interesting, but as it is, in the original version, it isn't very good. Edit: After a few days' consideration, and after seeing it again from the comfort of my own home, I realise what a truly awful film Tenet is and I have now changed my rating to 3/10 (and that's me being generous). I'm sorry but I cannot forgive how poorly written and what cliches the 'villain' and the wifey were, nor the lack of charisma of the 'protagonist', nor the rubbish sound that was done on purpose in order for repeat viewings and more money in their pockets. Shame on Nolan for treating cinema goers with contempt."
1190,"A lot to process & some elements were spoiled by the trailers, but not in the context that you would presume & the sound made you feel you were being kicked in the head. Some issues with the narrative but as filmmaking goes it's pretty incredible."
1191,"I really wanted to like this movie but I found it really hard to hear for one and follow , I had to keep asking my son what's happening but he was struggling to follow it as well , maybe just not right for me as I see lots of people really enjoyed it ."
1192,It was a delight to watch tenet after slightly disappointing (for me) Nolan's prior Dunkirk. Definitely another master piece of Sir Christopher Nolan works. Gave 9/10 just because sound mixing wasn't good enough at places.
1193,It was another Hollywood trick to try and lure people in and in the end your left with a big headache as it was so loud and nothing else.
1194,"Let's make a movie with a very difficult story so that nobody understands. They will love it and we might even get an oscar. Right? Wrong! I lost interest in the movie after 2min... the rest was just painfully. It's flat, it's boring. The invented rules of reversing time, in my opinion, makes no sense and is just a bad excuse for wearing a ""bane-like"" oxygen mask(like in Dunkirk, Nolan loves the bane/mask voice). The actors were probably so concentrated to look credible without understanding the story that they feel emotionless. It's bad, but looks like some people loved it. I didn't. Never again..."
1195,"It is the eve of the indefinite closure of Regal cinemas, and with the looming obliteration of one of the institutions that saw our homefront through the Great Depression, a World War, and countless other crisis... I scrounged around for an excuse to see a film on the big screen. And it was a choice between Tenet and Hocus Pocus (a film that we project on bed sheets in our neighborhood around Haloween... yeah, not gonna face Covid for that).Anyway, this film is just trash. It's James Bond meets Edge of Tomorrow, only it wasn't born out of a love for cloak-and-dagger international espionage, nor a nerds homage to sci-fi. No, this film was clearly born in the editing room when somebody doing frame by frame reverse playbacks of CGI got the idea of superimposing a reverse reel onto a forward motion reel.It doesn't work. The initial premise is fine -- some simple machines are flowing through time backward. But then the ante just keeps getting up'ed higher and higher so that the earlier stakes kinda seem pointless. And through it all there is a kind of ridiculous ""lets stop saving the world to save the pretty girl"", and then the ""I am doing this for my son"" schlock. Imagine James Bond saying, ""I had to kill him so he wouldn't think he'd won."" No sir. Not professional.20 minutes in to this 3-hour pile of trash, it became clear what makes a Bond film exciting... the thing that brings a tear to the forefront of your eye, or makes you feel like you need to run to the little boys room and tinkle. It's the space between the set-pieces. It's not exactly plot transition. Plot transition is when two main characters have to be show hanging out in a storage container talking so that the audience can be let in on the secret of WFT they are doing. The think I'm talking about is visual and auditory transition. We go from M's office to a wide shot of the Alpine ski resort... or Bond in his Jaguar tearing along a winding road. The audience's eye is traveling with the camera, and there is definitely traveling music announcing your pending arrival somewhere cool.Tenet has none of that. I don't even think there was any music. Just lots of explosions and baritones blasting ""WHOOOOMMMMMMMMM"". Yeah, putting the same spice on every dish is kinda like hitting the same musical note in every scene.Here's another tip to the production team -- don't spray darken your leading actor's beard. His beard is the equivalent of Groucho's eyebrows, only pasted over the entire lower half of his face. If James Bond had a beard, it would not look like this.I sat through this garbage in I-Max. I almost wish I had gone for that tepid looking rom-com, which was the only alternative. So as the curtain falls on my local cinema, all I can do is blame Hollywood. This isn't because people are scared of covid. I see them out at the pickleball courts, not wearing masks -- the senior citizens even. I see them in the restaurants drinking a beer and not social distancing. I see the teachers, afraid to be in a classroom with the kids without plexi-glass cages, milling around in the parking lot running through the daily gossip. But there were exactly 4 people in this movie theater tonight... each space > 10 feet apart. Four delusional individuals who thought an Fx extravaganza this Tenet be a nice way to say goodby to the big screen. It is confirmed. Cinema is now officially dead."
1196,"This movie requires an above average Intelligence Quotient to understand and enjoy. Unfortunately, most people do not have an above average IQ. Hence all the reviews claiming the movie was too complex, too confusing, or doesn't make any sense. You must have a general understanding of physics and Einstein's theory of relativity to be able to understand this movie. If you are the type of person who enjoys movies that force you to use your brain you will love this movie! The Matrix has been my favorite movie for 21 years, since 1999. Before that Interview With A Vampire was my favorite of all time. James Cameron's Avatar is close. Tenet is better than The Matrix. Christopher Nolan just moved himself into top three greatest writer directors of all time with thia film. He was already top 25. This movie puts him in the top three. Zack Snyder, M. Night Shyamalan, Christopher Nolan. Not only can they create a visually stunning film, they write incredible stories and fill them out on film. Go watch this movie in the theater before it is too late!"
1197,"What a horrible experience. Loud, painful, couldn't follow any of it. Action is great but without any context, what is the point? Just a bunch of random interactions, shootings, car chasing a from a bunch of random characters in different locations.... blaaahhhhh"
1198,MY GOD! Fantastic movie with so many jaw dropping moments!
1199,Started off very slow then it sped up but there was so much going on It gives u a headache at the end all in all just a bad movie
1200,We need to be invested in the lead characters and Washington does not deliver. Robert Pattinson deserved to star alongside someone on his acting level or higher.
1201,"Every time I see Christopher Nolan released a new movie, my heart skips a beat. Let's just say after Inception, Memento and Interstellar, my expectations were as high as can be.
The fact that this movie actually lived up to what I expected, blew me away. Definitely a new one to add to the must watch list, along with the ones previously mentioned.
It is in fact thoroughly complex, with many philosophical questions throughout. As always, Nolan plays with time itself, and it may be hard to grasp if you are not familiar with his ways, or if you aren't 100% focused. I would recommend perhaps watching the movie with subtitles, and if you don't understand it at first, that you watch it a second time.
After you grasp the concept, you will be able to enjoy a real masterpiece, that will certainly remain in your mind the following days after watching it. Purely amazing, fulfilled all a fan could hope for."
1202,"The ""score"" was apparently written to induce headaches and pure discomfort for the audience and the sound mixing on this film ought to be criminal. It's as if they do not want anyone to be able to pay attention to the dialogue. When action sequences get going you're in for sonic torture. The volume made me cover my ears multiple times. Seriously think I suffered hearing loss from this mess of a movie. I can't speak to the plot because I'm not sure this film has one. I'm certain Nolan understands perfectly what's going on but he didn't bother creating a movie that explains this to the movie goer. Talk about convoluted! The big battle scene at the end had to be important for some reason. I'm just not sure why. To say the story is a bewildering and unpleasant succession of painfully noisy and confusing action scenes is being charitable. I wanted the lead actor to be solid but he's got work to do. Just wasn't buying what he was trying to sell on screen. It's not his fault the movie is so horrific, however. You've got a script with no character development and zero emotional ties for the audience except maybe the emotion you feel when you hear cats screeching."
1203,"I promised myself that I wouldn't put any spoilers in this, and I'll keep that promise, but, WOW! TENET WAS MIND-BLOWING! Much like Inception, it was a puzzle. It was very confusing and really made you think. My only complaint is that the beginning was a bit boring and hard to follow. Other than that, Christopher Nolan, you've outdone yourself again."
1204,"A perfect movie at the right time
I loved the action scenes"
1205,"As said in the title, the movie is hard to comprehend if you're not very invested in science and physics. Personally I spend a lot of time studying space, time, and physics in itself. From my perspective I found this movie a masterpiece. The physics involving the reversal of time are phenomenal. Everything makes sense. But enough of me flexing my understanding of the film.The film itself is pieced together fantastically. You are guaranteed to be confused throughout the whole film, which is what Nolan wanted to achieve. But paying close attention throughout the whole film, everything will make sense. Every scene is a crumble being pieced together to form a whole at the end of the movie.I won't spoil anything but I can say that this is a must-watch. I see a lot of negative reviews of the film here, yet the arguments for the film being ''not up to expectations'' aren't quite solid. 90% of the reviews here are not written by people who are very invested with the movie and the masterpiece hidden within the movie. Also these reviews seem to complain a lot about the audio mixing. Personally I didn't have any trouble hearing the dialogs in the movie. There were some times where the music would be much louder than the person speaking, but this only occurred when the dialog wasn't of any importance to the movie.As said this is a must-watch, and yet another masterpiece from Nolan. I don't have any complaints towards the movie and this is why I'm giving it a 10/10. Best 2,5 hours of my 2020 so far. If given the opportunity, please do watch this in iMax for the better experience.10/10"
1206,Frustrating in it's endless complexity and exposition with bland characters that i felt no attachment to. Bondesque in scale and all the superficiality of a franchise film. I applaud Nolan's vision for the grand theme and putting that idea on screen but like Interstellar i would have like to have that same emotional pull but it was lacking.
1207,"It was a very good initiative to a very good movie, however, story is complicated, and hard to follow, and many gaps in the script."
1208,A very confusing story with poor dialogue. Several errors of logic which I found annoying.
1209,Nolan Nolan Nolan what do you do in this film you blowings us
1210,"Being a borderline Nolan fanatic being disappointed, maybe even annoyed with an offering from this usual flawless film maker is an unusual feeling, a man who's biggest crime has been delivering a slightly boring first act of a Batman origin story that was redeemed in the final act and subsequent sequels.Tenet is best described as a film that looks better mapped out on a whiteboard than on a cinema screen, not in terms of the visuals which are at their usual mega high standard with Nolan but everything else. Sound mixing that will give you a headache for hours and leave you wishing subtitles were standard as you've missed large chunks of dialog because of it, a story with little to no personal stakes for any of the characters, very disappointingly falling into the James Bond problem that it's highly unlikely your film is going to end with the world actually ending.A frequent theme of the great Nolan films were not just the over arching need to save the world stakes but a personal goal for our protagonists to achieve, Bruce Wayne to save Gotham and make it out alive, Cobb to return to his children, Cooper to make it back to Murph, some failed, some succeeded, some left open to interpretation. Tenet lacks any of these stakes leaving you no doubt that by the time you've come full circle on the story, and yes the story is a circle in shape, the protagonists will have succeeded.I have no doubt this film will age to better reviews upon repeat viewings, but as a one off experience I didn't get anywhere near the satisfaction as that from previous instalments of the Nolanverse."
1211,"If you put interstellar, inception and James Bond in a room and they had a baby they would call it Tenet. There is no way I could possibly describe the concept to you it's something you have to watch yourself."
1212,More incomprehensible sci-fi tosh from the most overrated director of the last decade. Memento wasn't bad but everything since has been overblown and confusing for confusing sake.
1213,"Another example of hype and no final product, the film gets bogged down in its own identity and in the end misfires."
1214,"I'm not sure about some of the ratings. In a world where movies spoon feed you everything. Tenet needs your attention. It's rare that a blockbuster makes you think. This one does. The action sequences are filmed well. If you watch it more than once. You will understand it. I understood it, for the most part, on one viewing. There were a few parts I had not quite figured out. But. A second viewing remedied that. As far as the audio goes. I had no issue in my theater. Watched in a Dolby atmos. And everything was fine. I guess a lot of people are used to playing on their phones while watching, since movies like the avengers don't need any brain cells to understand. Not hating on those movies. Just making a comparison. Again. If you pay attention. In the end you will understand the movie. It comes together in a fantastic way. Don't get frustrated half way thru. Give it till the end."
1215,"The movie was a bad science fiction trying to be an action movie. The concepts and physics/reality-bending rules that are established by the movie are broken all over the place. The movie makes absolutely no sense whatsoever even if you try to suspend your critical thinking. I got the strong impression that they wanted to make a movie with an original idea and they recognized that the idea of ""objects"" (including) people moving backwards in time would be hard for people to just accept, so instead of making it as believable as possible, by limiting the use of the concept to as little as necessary, the writers of this film did the opposite; They double-down on the false science, claiming that fiery explosions will give someone moving backwards hypothermia, and people moving backwards cannot breath normal air but can do just fine with a non-air-tight oxygen mask, for example. I can't help but think the writers and director were hoping that by making the reality-bending rules so complicated, that it would cause the audience to not question any of it. It really came off as: ""this movie is too smart for you to get, so just stop trying to think about it. You are too stupid to get it."" But the reality is the movie itself it just ridiculously reality and physics ignorant, desperately trying to appear smart."
1216,"Nolan continues to show some ingenuity in creating stories, but the form and body of his narrative is not strong enough.Tenet is not as complex a film as it seems. What seems to add to that complexity is how poor its narrative remains, unfortunately, in terms of film language and script, lacking any feeling and whose only purpose is to convey information to the viewer. It shines in the action, without being overflowing, but it does not bring any emotion in terms of the really important moments in the story.It uses its already known temporal tricks to tell a story of spies that covers past, present and future, but despite the interesting idea, its development is clumsy and monotonous.I still feel Nolan's narrative is very artificial in both text and editing. The vast majority of his films have a very big problem of rhythm and tempo in terms of directing and editing; but the fault of this is his own text, which is only used to exchange dialogues with data, data and more data, without providing a minimum of empathy or depth to any of the characters... They all act just because he puts it in the script.The action, although ingenious, sins from these problems. They work only because of the music track that accompanies them, which is what generates the tension, but beyond that it also feels quite artificial.It is a pity that a film with such an original and interesting idea is left empty by the ways of bringing it to the text and the screen.Tenet is not a complicated film to understand, but the alleged complexity of the idea is compounded by the neutrality and hollowness of the narrative."
1217,"Nolan is certainly one of the most brilliant film makers of our time. I loved Inception and Interstellar. Both are breathtaking examples of his concept of highly entertaining movies on an equally high intellectual level. But, and now that's the difference to his latest film Tenet, they have a touching emotional background as well, which turns them into masterpieces.
In my opinion this time he overdid it a bit. Technically brilliant of course, breathtaking sequences, but you can reach a point of intellectual smartness, which quickly can turn into simple boredom, when you forget to deliver a heart and soul too. Sorry, but this time it didn't work for me."
1218,"Bad casting, poor script, embarrassing dialogues, just violence. I'm a big Christopher Nolan fan; and this is so disappointing. There are not so many scene that make sense; just a big pretentious bubble. Okay, some action scenes are well made. But none of the characters is somebody you would like to know. You simply don't believe what they say. If you want to leave your local movie in a bad mood, watch this."
1219,"Cinematically it was great. The story just makes no sense. It's explained in such an abbreviated matter that afterwards I felt like the premise was just idiotic. Action scenes were interesting, acting was fine...story was just nonsense"
1220,"Of course there still have a lot of hole scrip but this movie will be one of the best time-travel movie all the time .People says that Robert Pattinson and the cast didn't show their talent because the movie was too fast and give too much informations . If you rewatch for more than 2 times, Robert is amazing with his character the whole time , a inverted-time guy , know a lot of secrets but have to keep it aways from The Protagonist . He is the guy from the future but have to die in the past . He is the guy that make sure every events ""What's happened, happened"" .I'm gonna rewatch the movie soon , you should too ."
1221,"I walked away from this feeling like I understood it emotionally/intuitively but my brain was playing catch up. You may walk away both feeling like you don't understand it intuitively AND intellectually. But you probably do understand it intuitively, but the catch up the mind plays taints your instinctive understanding with doubt, inconfidence and a feeling of inadequacy. All of this if solved however through rewatches. Nolan's not a moron, and he doesn't think you're a moron either, and knows you will understand it eventually. No, he's not attacking your intelligence. If anything he's betting on it.And if you have a problem with having to rewatch, I'll leave you with this Stanley Kubrick quote.""To see a film once and write a review is an absurdity. Yet very few critics ever see a film twice or write about films from a leisurely, thoughtful perspective. The reviews that distinguish most critics, unfortunately, are those slambang pans which are easy to write and fun to write and absolutely useless. There's not much in a critic showing off how clever he is at writing silly, supercilious gags about something he hates."""
1222,"The things that Tenet mastered, executing such an insane storyline, shot sequences, and planning and execution at that scale, was all incredible. I can't imagine how Nolan directed the actors to play the characters with such a plot, and such heavy dialogues.
I don't think anyone would have been able to execute such a plot, conflict, and make a cohesive film out of this fictional universe.
This film took the spy film genre and gave it the biggest rewamp. Tenet is Memento, Inception, and Dunkirk combined inside a James Bond film.
Nolan's goal is always to make people come to cinemas. He makes cinematic masterpieces that force people to come together, in a room, and enjoy it together. And that's why I think this film was successful in what it wanted to accomplish. This makes me want to rewatch it. Again and again.
We have cinema screens because of films that earn so much, that employ so many people. We need blockbusters, and this one is the best kind of blockbuster.
To be unbiased, I will also mention the places I think it lacked, which were emotionally strong characters, and an emotional grip on the film, which Inception and Interstellar mastered. This film had an insane storyline, and to be honest, I don't think it needed emotionally charged characters. This was pure adrenaline filled, large screen, sci-fi action packed entertainment, in one of the most complicated narrative driven films.
If I would have to rate it, I'd give it a 10/10. This wasn't my favorite Nolan film to watch, but is still going to be an unforgettable one. This film achieved it's goal. This film will be in the history books for contributing towards keeping cinema alive."
1223,"Christopher Nolan is a talent like no other. After 5 years, comes perhaps his most complicated film yet, with an incredible plot. The writing is spectacular, and the directing is possibly the best I've seen. Locations and set pieces are stunning, and once again the film is perfectly cast! Worth multiple watches as you figure out the subtle plot points, films like this don't come along often enough so we should be grateful when they do."
1224,"A Cinematic Experience .....#ChristopherNolan returns with #Tenet, a film which seems to experiment with the paradigms of time in an extravagant format...."
1225,"I hated every minute of this movie and could have walked out at any point without caring. I was so glad when it finally ended. I have no idea what it was all about and have no inclination to EVER watch it again! It actually made me really angry for two and a half hours. I was quite a fan of Mr Nolan but this is a self indulgent pile of rubbish!!
The sound track is a disgrace spent so much time staring to hear actors dialogue & this MUST have been done on purpose Its a horrible, frustrating, hopeless flop"
1226,"The film claims a great deal without providing the evidence or ensuring that the claimed relationships and scenarios are actually transmitted to the audience. It claims that the world is in danger, but at no point does this danger come across. It is claimed that the main actor and the wife of the evil Russian develops a relationship without showing that a relationship is developing.
All the time I was sitting in the cinema and thought: ""This is it? This is a Nolan film! And that's all he could think of? We see action sequences forward, and then just the same sequence a little later backwards?
The film had little or no emotional content (which was exactly Nolan's strength - the perfect balance between story and great cinema). With impressive action, they tried to distract the audience from the lack of dramaturgy, boring one-dimensional characters and conflict-free explanatory scenes.Acting:
Washington's son didn't earn the role, he got it for political reasons, because he is Washington's son. He can't wear this film at any time, can't deliver the sets properly, has 0 charisma and 0 charisma. A son who is simply given a leading role by his father's connections has never been a good idea. His performance is disappointing, an insult to all the other great actors who could have done it miles better but who don't have a famous father.
Basically the cast is disappointing in general. I don't know if the shooting conditions for this movie were difficult, but sometimes it seems as if the actors didn't understand the script or the movie itself 100%. They seem a bit lost. With the script that looked more like a big mess, this is not surprising. I didn't find anyone outstanding and was disappointed with the performances all round.This film has an impressive directing and great action scenes. But that alone does not make a good film and does not excuse a flawed dramaturgy.
My rating is so negative because I expect much more from Nolan than an 0815 action spy movie a la James Bond. I was thrilled by Prestige, in awe at Inception and Interstellar I have seen it in the cinema several times. We had interesting relationship dynamics in the other films between father and daughter, husband and ex-wife or two rivals who fight each other because the great love dies in a magic trick.And now we have a second Jaden Smith, who in the beginning risks his life for his mission, but in the end risks saving the world because of the Russian's wife, with whom he has nothing else to do except exchanging cool sayings.Very disappointing."
1227,"A visually stunning movie that has absolutely nothing to say, with women serving as punching bags."
1228,"After the movie starts, it is clear that it gets veery fast and very complex, already to a level that you can't follow - the story is quite predictable, no doubts - the discussions are quite cheesy and and empty - the background music is indeed in many scenes too loud so that you cannot understand the talking - and all in all certain story lines are so twisted that you would like to stop the movie and rewind or even ask your partner by your side (unfortunately not possible in the cinema). Either you watch the movie again or you leave it.
Very exceptional tough: Chapeau to the production team! The inverted scenes are imaginably not easy to bring on the screen."
1229,"At the end this movie leaves you with almost nothing, not much to remember or to think about. Just many puzzles to solve and ideas to guess. Just entertainment, I was expecting more from Nolan. Sound mix awful, couldn't get half of the dialogues."
1230,"It really has taken me a while to sum up my thoughts after seeing the film about a day ago. So here we go.Christopher Nolan's latest feature film Tenet is a fully packed and spectacular mess. I was definitively excited to return to the big cinema screen and witness one of the best modern film directors tackle the time travel concept, but all my expectations and suspicions of what could have been were unfortunately in vain.Tenet's biggest failure is surprisingly also where Nolan's earlier films succeeded the most, which is filtering complex ideas into a coherent and substantial narrative. With Inception and Memento, films which ideas would probably sound like nonsense on paper, are crystal clear when showcased through the cinematic lens. But this isn't the case with Tenet. Instead, threads and information that seems mysterious and anticipatory at the opening act of the film devolves into a dump of convoluted techno-babble an hour in, with the characters constantly trying to explain the plot even though at no point communicating to the audience why things are going on or why we should care.Just because the script is complex does not mean it is good. Beneath the artificial layers of Tenet, there is a crucial lack of character, emotion and heart. It is an empty film.And then you have some scenes here that are almost comedic, like a parody of Nolan's signature style. I couldn't help laughing at the dialogue in these scenes, which folds in onto itself 1000 times over backwards through spacetime. Case in point: preparing for the final battle in STALSK-12.Yes, Tenet has a multitude of fantastic, awesome action set pieces; it's gorgeously photographed and has some competent actors in the lead. But for every neat shot there's the bass boosted score by Ludwig Göransson (which hurt my precious ears in the cinema) and for every John David Washington was the wimpy ""Russian arms dealer"" Kenneth Branagh. He was the worst part of Dunkirk and the worst part of Tenet. Sorry.But to say that I was disappointed is really the wrong word. This experience was so overwhelming so any real emotion escapes you. I know for sure it isn't happiness or excitement I felt, but a kind of exhaustion.I'm feeling a strong 6/10. My rating could go higher on repeat viewings, but I don't really feel like investing any more time here..."
1231,"To all the messed up people who thought this film was amazing, you really need to have your heads examined!One of the worst movies ever made!"
1232,"It feels like producers were focusing on making money rather then really thinking about scenario.
I didn't find any explanation for actions that were made by actors.
The beginning of the film was intriguing but then turned out to the mess.
Why did they bombed theatre?
Why did they broke airport and airplane?
Producers, please read wikipedia about how radiation works.
Why did they touched so called plutonium by hands?
Too many places, heroes are randomly jumping
around the world.
At the end She shot her husband and there is no blood. How come?
Generally I found it extremely unlogical and unrealistic."
1233,"I have to re-watch The Prestige, The Dark Knight and Interstellar. I don't want to forget why you are a total genius... Christopher, call your brother and make another movie. A big mistake happens to everyone, also to the best. Let's move forward. I love you Nolan the same but refund me the money of the tickets please."
1234,"I want my time back.Next time, we dont want John David Washington. He is stupid actor, no emotion nothing just reading the script.We want Matthew Mcconaughey back."
1235,"Why why why would anyone ever think this is a good movie. Not for one second did I think I'm not smart enough to understand this movie because this movie has zero point to it. Story is garbage, action is garbage, script is garbage and plot is garbage. They say you need to watch this twice because the music and sound is too loud to hear any of the dialogue, well I watched with subtitles and now wish I didnt because not only did I have to watch it but I bloody read the movie too. Dont even bother. Didn't pay to watch this movie but I bloody want my money back anyway."
1236,"A good example of how a movie shouldn´t be done.
And it is very clear that its rating is related to the fear of many of those who watched it without understanding anything but they just don´t want to let other think they are dumb.A waste of time."
1237,"Good action and effects, but hard to properly follow and you'll give up at a point.Interesting concept, but too much of the movie is spent trying to explain it to you. These explanations miss the grade school writing recommendation of 'show not tell'.The performance of the main protagonist is underwhelming and as a whole you'll likely fail to really connect or get overly invested in the story.Saw it in theaters and went in with high hopes given Nolan's many previous bangers. Shame it's a flop. I wouldn't tell someone not to see it, but they're not missing anything if they don't."
1238,Such a masterpiece! and hard to understand....................................
1239,"In my opinion not the best work from Nolan. Movie had a great idea/concept of time inversion that had potential, but was poorly executed. Started very well, however how movie went it got uninteresting.Plot was kinda basic. Another movie how Americans are saving the world against ""bad"" Russian oligarch who is actually not that bad, as he is in some sort of way saving the world as well, but from different perspective, presented in bad light.Nolan inserted some level of humor in to dialogue. i got impression that specific lines didn't match the characters and situations, running scenes.It was to laud most of the time, sound effects covering character voices and making it sometimes hard to keep up with dialog.If we take away complex/confusing part, time inversion that keep audience attention, it would be another B grade action movie about saving humanity. Complex element really makes ""Tenet"" to stand out against other action/sci fi and gives this movie a edge, but he could wrap it better."
1240,"I ll be hones, it took me 2 hours and few YouTube movies to put in place some missing elements after seeing the movie once.I usually do that for complicated films as, for me, in order to be a masterpiece it has to make sense in it's universe.So, after seeing some clips about stuff that I ve missed only seeing the movie once everything started to make sense perfectly.I believe it is a hard movie to get entirely for an average viewer especially if you are not hungry to understand all the details as I am.In the end I encourage you to see it, maybe twice or thrice, to get it properly and when you do believe me you will consider it a masterpiece as I do.Great acting, nice dialogs, amazing story and directing.10/10"
1241,A masterpiece and definitely worth watching twice.
1242,"I'll be honest, you won't understand the film on the first watch unless you are multi-genius. On the first watch you go into the cinema with the expectation of seeing some never seen before actions and visuals which will take away your mind from understanding the film and rather lets you just immerse in the film and enjoy what's been played on the screen in front of you. And trust me you won't be disappointed. On the second watch you apply the phrase ""try not to understand it but feel it"". You'll somehow understand it by feeling it but you won't know how to explain it. And then you realize you have just witnessed a masterpiece of modern cinema and art.Yes there are its flaws. The common complaint is the audio mixing. You'll struggle to hear or understand what the characters are saying. Definitely need subtitles. Or get your hands on the script from online.I hope when they release the home video, they would tweak and adjust the audio clear enough for us to hear it.Seriously a MASTERPIECE that you don't wanna miss seeing in a cinema."
1243,"""Time travel"" but not in the traditional sense. Amazing plot which will take each of us five more viewings to understand and slowly unpack. Everything matters, which is quite taxing mentally and takes away from enjoyment of the wonderful & relentless action. Slightly unbelievable that everyone in the movie instantly understand how it all works in this warped reality. Any normal person would freak out for at least 5 minutes first. Washington is a good lead, but his youth lacked gravitas, especially in the end."
1244,"Having watched the movie 3 times, I can say that its a masterpiece! Funny enough, I was able to catch the dialogue when I watched it on a standard screen, not IMAX. I agree the score is too loud and some dialogue is muffled, but if you watch more than once, you will understand the logic behind this movie.No spoilers here, but this is a movie that will take you in a journey covering 3 timelines (past, present & future). The idea of the movie has never been visited before and the execution was perfect. I will give this movie a 10/10 if only Nolan was more clearer and straightforward on the idea of the movie like Inception. In inception, you can know what is going to happen because the characters give you heads-up or a clue. In TENET, you have to be the protagonist and figure it out yourself which is not well received by some people.The ending of the movie could be a start for a sequel that can clear some doubts of the movie plot.I recommend watching it more than one time and preferably in a standard screen. Not IMAX."
1245,Even for Christopher Nolan this film makes no sense. The plot resembles something that someone very high on drugs might come up with right before passing out. Most of the film is chases and fights. I actually could not summarize the plot if I tried. It's a sad waste of talent because the leads are all charismatic.
1246,Not going to write an essay because I cant. I went just because its Christopher Nolan. I did started getting bored by the time of the last battle scene but dialed back in by the last conversation. I did come to realize something goofy at the return to the airport but definitely didnt get robert pattison at the end of the movie. Definitely going to see again. Just like I did for Inception. Stay thru the credits for Travis Scott bumping song that fits the movie to a teeeeeee!BUT JESUS WHY WAS THE MOVIE SOOOOOO LOUD? The chair was vibrating.
1247,"I understand some people have been left confused or disappointed with this movie. I'm not one of them.Honestly? I had little idea what this movie was about going into it. All I really knew was that it was, and I quote, ""Bond on Acid"" and that it dealt with reversing time. That's really about it. However, there's much more to this movie than what meets the eye from the trailers.Is it loud? Yes. Very loud. (In fact, I jumped out of my seat within the first few minutes). Does it require a second viewing? Most likely because of that fact alone. Even though I understood it, I still feel like there were things I missed. But that isn't so say my first viewing wasn't extraordinary. This movie had me on edge at times; I was incredibly invested. The action was loud, fast and intense throughout. ""The Protagonist"", while we're not given his name (marked for spoilers for that reason alone), was incredibly charismatic and pretty funny at times. The use of the ""inversion"" was incredibly clever and made for some awesome action sequences.Typical Christopher Nolan, things tie into each other. Except with this movie, everything you see ties into each other. That is just incredible on it's own. Every event in this movie means something; everything that happens is an event that matters. Nothing is really just there to extend the runtime.The performances are great. John David Washington is great; Robert Pattinson is definitely a great actor. Everyone in this movie delivers an awe-inspiring performance, with intense drama and action and witty comedy at times. And I love it!The score, despite it not being Hans Zimmer (which is rare for Nolan nowadays), is incredible. Really sets the scene. And if my hearing is right, when the reverse portion of specific scenes are shown, the same score is played in reverse. Nice touch!Last but not least, the climax of the movie is incredible. The cinematography throughout the movie is incredible, but here it is second to none. The use of effects, sound, shots, the lot. It's simply incredible.Honestly, the only gripes I have with this movie are that the audio can be a bit too loud for it's own good in certain scenes. That or, depending on the scene, speech can seem a little muffled. On top of that, it's incredibly complex. Not confusing, but complex, so for some it probably won't be for them. But all in all? Fantastic cinematic masterpiece that requires your attention if you're willing to give it your time.And to wrap this off. No. It is not ""Bond on Acid"". It's ""Nolan on Acid"".Well done, Christopher Nolan. You've done it once again."
1248,"The whole movie hangs on convincing the audience that the character played by Kenneth Branagh would actually do the things he does. Branagh totally sells it. This is one of the best performances I've ever seen in a major blockbuster. John Washington is the other half of this and does almost as well as 'The Protagonist'.As to the rest of the movie? Well, pretty good. The story and the premise are very complex. It works because we care about the characters and they seem to understand it, even if we don't. Its a movie clearly intended to be watched multiple times and will hopefully get better after each viewing.The effects are really breathtaking and well worth seeing in a theatre. Although, Nolan seems to have fallen too much in love with his trick photography; I got a little board towards the end. It was like ""OK, it's another incredible effects sequence, nice, now lets get back to the story""."
1249,"Two thirds of the way into this film, Robert Pattinson's character, Neil, says ""does your brain hurt yet?"" This film does do that, it's the most complicated film I've seen since Inception. I only understood what was going on for about 60% of it. Having said that, this was the perfect first film back after lockdown. It's a proper action movie with brilliant set pieces and has a very unusual soundtrack and sound effects. Some have said it's too loud but I loved that, the noise reverberated around the auditorium and right into my chest providing the full cinematic experience. The locations are also fab including two of my favourite places, Tallinn and Amalfi. John David Washington is a very likeable lead in it performing alongside Elizabeth Debicki and Robert Pattinson. Washington's character is known as the Protagonist but you are left questioning right up until the end who is really pulling the strings of this time bending story. I won't say more so as not to spoil it and also because I would have trouble explaining what I *think* actually happened. But for my first film back on the big screen I was delighted."
1250,"The movie is pretty good , Nolan is making movies to from our ERA, after watching it twice it made sense perfectly. Too much wrote about the novies sounds, but I think they made the movie even more perfect. Recommenden"
1251,"This is an amazing movie. Extremely entertaining, full of hidden secrets, and gets even better after a second viewing, but there are two main problems with it which I'm deducting from what could have been a 10/10 score:1. The audio is horrible. You cannot hear half of what is being said throughout the film - this is unacceptable for such a confusing, chaotic and fast paced movie. I'm willing to forgive this if the problem is fixed when it becomes available for streaming/purchase and when subtitles can be turned on.2. Some scenes in this movie are way too chaotic and I could not tell why characters were doing what they were (exacerbated by not being able to hear what they were saying). This was purely because of what shots they decided to include in scenes - Inception did not have this problem. I would have liked to see more camera shots from the ""bad guys"" perspectives in a few scenes as one example of how they could have made it more obvious what was happening."
1252,One more masterpiece from Nolan. After watching the movie I can easily say that tenet is the most complicated screenplay among his movies. It took me 3 viewings to develop a proper understanding.
1253,"Incredibly choppy, can't understand or hear most dialogue, constant annoying pointless action without a consistent storyline. Most actors did well despite terrible material. Pattinson is bad. This was a clone of Nolan's Insipid movie (Inception). Waste of 2.5 hours."
1254,"From Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, Emperor's new clothes, the emperor's new clothes is the expression often used to describe a situation in which people are afraid to criticize something because everyone else seems to think it is good or important.Don't waste 2 hrs+ of your life which you will not get back in this time or a parallel one. Watch this in either and you will regret it!"
1255,"What a spectacular pendulum!!Another masterpiece from the one and only Christopher Nolan! as an avid music listener and an audiophile I can honestly say contrary to lots of opinions that the sound mixing is amazingly crafted for this picture, the dialogue in some scenes is mixed a bit down by design vs the awesome powerful soundtrack composed by
Ludwig Göransson so the viewer is immersed in the scene with the character (whether it is the protagonist or Neil) ie: When Neil went to examine the Freeport as he's walking and observing the halls you can without doubt notice the music volume gets louder and louder compared to the voice of the dude who was accompanying Neil which was getting lower and lower (that inversion motive gets repeated throughout the movie in sound and picture).Obviously you will enjoy that movie by repetition, personally I enjoyed it more on the 2nd watch in IMAX, and yes the movie has an extremely fast tempo and fast montage which again is cut that way by design, Nolan wants you to get confused on 1st watch just like the protagonist character was throughout his journey, it is a genius mirroring technique in my opinion!Another genius shot was during the first act right after the Opera house prologue when they caught the protagonist and tied him to a chair, one of the antagonists held a ""Pincer"" to yank one of the teeth and at the same shot 2 trains (one going forward and another going backward on the tracks) :D :D :D a very poetic reflection of the movie's temporal pincer movement theme.I honestly believe this is one of THE best pictures Nolan has produced so far, however I don't think you will enjoy it if you are not familiar with Nolan's craftsmanship and previous work.PS: Yes, Neil is who you think he is ;) it makes perfect sense!"
1256,"""Don't try to understand it. Feel it.""
Woah! From its first few seconds, I tried to do exactly what the qoute from above says and... it worked. This is exactly one of those few films that you should ""feel"", not analyse too much while watching.
It's been quite a few months without any kind of cinema and to come back and see Tenet is truly a gift. This is one of those films that constantly keep you guessing and just when you ""think"" you've figured it out, well... you didn't. This is the beauty of it. This is the beauty of Christopher Nolan, who once again proves how much of a genius he is. The film is an enchanting emotional rollercoaster, that takes you on a one of a kind journey as a viewer. It makes you feel curoius at all times. Rarely do such big blockbuster films manage to do that, but Chris Nolan did it without trying to much.
As a huge fan of Chris Nolan, I had quite big expectations from this film, but I can honestly say that he took me by surprise. He's shown once more what he is capable of, by transposing his genius ideas onto the screen. In the recent years he managed to take his direction ""style"" to the next level and you could totally see it even here in his latest feature film. He has become more and more mature in his direction/writing and even though each and every single one of his films has something special about it, he continues to evolve as a filmmaker day by day, which is quite pleasant to witness.
When it comes to the acting, I honestly think that John David Washington did an amazing job as The Protagonist. He was really present and engaged at all times, managing to keep his emotions in place and delivering exactly what the audience wanted. As expected, Robert Pattinson was nothing but excellent. He has become such a diverse and versatile actor in the recent years and he is starting to deliver one great performance after another. Although he doesn't get that much screentime, he is killing each and every scene he is in. His accent was just the perfect ""touch"" to his charismatic character and overall I have to say that he was just fantastic everytime he was on the screen. Not to mention the fact that his charcater might just be the key to this whole film and those final 5 minutes were absolutely great from his part. Also, his on screen chemistry with John David was simply great and I hope to see them again soon. Kenneth Branagh and Elizabeth Debicki were also quite good, but I expected a bit more from Kenneth's part, especially in a few moments in which he overplayed his emotions.
To be honest, the score in this picture was utterly amazing. Ludwig Göransson did such a great job at capturing the audience in the most important scenes with what he has composed and at times you almost feel like the music is the one part that makes you feel those intense emotions.
As for the cinematography, every scene was beautifully shot and the color palette was quite unique and complex most of the times.
Overall, I feel like Tenet will slowly become one of my favourite Nolan films, as it a truly unique and mesmerizing thriller from beginning until the end. I personally loved every second of it and most importantly, I loved how much it made me think and analyse afterwards. I will definitely give it a second watch in the next few days and try to understand it more, but for now I'm just going to enjoy its greatness. If you have the chance to see it, then you should do so, as you won't regret it!"
1257,"Didn't understand the whole idea of the movie and it was too hard to follow
Need to watch it like 3 times so we would fully understand
How ever i fall in sleep"
1258,"I rated it with 2 only because I love Kenneth Branagh. Otherwise, I found it waste of time. The movie is too long for a story like this, many things are unanswered and unclear. You cannot follow where they are at what point, even the time travel is done with some omissions that don't make the story complete. Definitely - if you are not James Cameron, don't try to make movies with time travel. That's it."
1259,"I came in to watch the movie with a high expectation with not much knowledge what the film was about. I had seen the trailer and read a few journalists reviews calling it a 'Masterpiece'. So there was no reason not to be very excited.First 10 minutes, WOW this action is great, DAM this music score. But... what the hell are they talking about, I can't hear them over the overly loud music. Sadly this continued over the whole movie and only made it more confusing. I can understand making a movie in which some intelligence is needed to understand it however this brought that to a whole new level.The overall Plot was Ok, but for being such a 'clever' movie it didn't use the potential is could have used. After introduced into the main plot of the movie all that continues is several confusing scenes with very cinematic looking shots and CGI. It should have been made to be much simpler in terms of plot, but still kept the main idea.The acting was fantastic as well as all the action, however with many sections of the movie, I am watching just people running around shooting (not sure what), and it doesn't get explained (or if did could hear any of the dialogue).Yes, it may be easier to understand it after a second viewing, but I would like to watch a movie and understand it without watching it again and watching a 1 hour explanatory videos.I will be amazed if any normal movie goer could tell me the whole or even sections of the plot after watching it"
1260,"Seen the movie ""Tenet"" today. Besides some well-done elements (action scenes, original idea about our perception of time), the rest left me cold. The actors do not appear to be involved in their role (except Kenneth Branagh in the role of the Machiavellian husband). The music is a jumble of boring electronic sounds, without following the atmosphere of several scenes. It is even ridiculous at times. Several characters appear and never reappear. Why did they appear anyway? Several scenes are completely unnecessary and should have been cut during the editing to make a film shorter, but much more interesting. The natural sites (like the city of Oslo in which the villa of one of the characters is located) are very poorly exploited visually when they could have made the visual experience breathtaking. The main special effect used is also quite poorly exploited because, besides certain scenes, while the viewer should be amazed, it often looks as if nothing extraordinary is happening. My rating: 2.5 / 5 (just the passing mark)."
1261,I didn't get this movie but I got it has the most selfish villian ever and his stupid wife who will risk the world for her own pride
1262,"4 words - I...don't...get...it. Great sound effects, excellent soundtrack, fantastic acting, breathtaking action, but such a confusing plot that you feel like you should have studied temporal physics (if there is such a thing) before walking into the movie theatre, so you can actually follow the story without scratching your head. I'll have to watch this again to really think about what's actually happening in this film. Maybe then, I could rate it as high as everyone else is on here."
1263,"SkrrrtFor real though, another phenomenal film by the king. I wish he coulda helped us understand the ""inversion"" a little more. But with that being said that's what 2nd & 3rd viewings are for. See it in the theatre, enjoy it. Cuz this dude Mr Nolan is a absolute legend"
1264,I did not like this film and it was so loud I could not stand it where are the stories these days it's all special effects and nothing else.
1265,"First time in years I wanted the movie to end and go home. I couldn't walk out but wish I had the option. Very BAD movie. Just boring, too damn long and awfully explained. You can't even understand what's going on because how terrible explained it is."
1266,"Nothing new. Talking, talking, talking and talking."
1267,"Atrocious sound mixing, inaudible dialogue in an already very confusing film adds to the boredom. The plot is dumb this film is all hype. Was contemplating walking out halfway through were it not for the entry fee.
Just a shame I couldn't time travel back and not watch this."
1268,Way too hard to follow and very boring. Halfway through the movie I got so bored I started playing candy crush to keep myself from falling asleep
1269,"A masterpiece? Not quite, TENET as an experimental film is a success, its use of CGI is close to undetectable. Which presented a world to it's freaking natural. Maybe for others, it seems to be mind-opening, but to someone has watched, read a tone of sci-fi films and books, the concepte of fall back time and such theory isn't Sci-fi world's headline. But been presented in such real, down to the ground fashion with near perfection CGI work, TENET deservie a sport on everyone's watch list."
1270,Are you kidding me all the hype and I pay my euros for this arrogant Hollywood mess that is just loud and nothing else.
1271,"Christopher Nolan's most confusing movie yet! Omg. Not just due to the fact that they didn't make time to explain alot, but also due to the fact that every single time somebody stops to explain something they're wearing a mask, or eating food, or they're facing away from the camera, or their accent is sooooo thick you can't understand what they're saying. Maybe I'm dumb as hell but this movie made absolutely no sense whatsoever.
This is what happens when you write a movie on peyote."
1272,"A really badly made film in terms of sound effects, you can't hear the dialogues or understand the plot, all you can hear is overpowering loud sound effects and music and the actors mumbling all the eay"
1273,"Nolan attempts to outdo himself, because that's what everyone expects. In the case of Tenet he's created a film that can't hold water, much less create intrigue. I asked for a refund and I don't think another viewing will make it easier to appreciate this movie."
1274,"Nolan you beautiful genius, people will appreciate this masterpiece in the future"
1275,Just go watch. It's an amazing Nolan movie. Highly underrated.
1276,"Tenet is a movie that everyone needs to watch at some point in their life its packed with action sequences and funny bits it gets very confusing though so if you want to propley understand. It i
recommend watching it twice like i did and if you can watch it in 4dx it makes it alot more cooler."
1277,"I've just seen this movie a few hours ago. I hate to say it, but I'm pretty dissapointed (since I loved Nolan's movies Memento, The Prestige and The Dark Knight).What I liked:
CostumesSome of the camera-work (pretty much all that wasn't action itself)Most of the acting (considering the burden of the script)What I disliked:
Chaotic action - I really hate how almost every movie nowadays tries to make action as fast and chaotic as possible. Even though there are a few good examples of using chaotic action - this was not one of them...Heavy reliance on one particular visual gimmick, which gets real old real fastNo memorable music. I don't remember the last time I've seen a new movie with really distinct movie theme. This was just another generic ""try-to-be-as-epic-as-possible"" uninspired score.But most of all - is there some manual for screenwriters/directors nowadays saying that you shouldn't try to make your audiance to be emotionally invested in your characters? During all of the movie I was telling myself: ""am I supposed to care what happens next?"". The Protagonist is just somehow there (and yeah - the the main hero is called is ""Protagonist"" - they didn't even bother to give him a name - or maybe it was just some excersice in pretentiousness). I don't know what drives him, what are his fears, what is his past. Simply - no character exposition with maybe one exception concerning his willingness to obey rules. If he died 1 hour into the movie, I wouldn't mind. The same goes for pretty much all the characters.In conclusion -it's a shame. The basic idea is decent and it is obvious, that most of the of the film crew is really competent. But this movie was just another example of form above substance and the biggest dissapointment in a long time for me..."
1278,"What should i say. The Look, The Soundtrack, The Accting , The Story.
First the Look: it's stunning. The secene where the Plain goes into the hanger was pure cinma.
The Story: is an bassic agant Story with sc fi
Just love it"
1279,"* There is no end credit scene *The brilliant director Christopher Nolan brought a mind-blowing masterpiece and I love how he keeps his films uniquely fresh. To really have a more of understanding what is going on, one needs to be open-minded, and the most important piece is to sharpen the senses of sight and sound. One can't even blink because there are several important details that it will be coming back to. This story sets an interesting take of time and how magnificent it was projected. What fun it was noticing the details and putting it all together before the film reveals it, and some things are not officially revealed but it is still there for one to place everything. I think this movie became my favorite film by Christopher Nolan! because it was profoundly complex and he likes to intensify our minds, how I love to analyze everything. This is one of the best time movies ever because he is not only applying known thoughts of time, he did it with his own distinguished twist. The inverted scenes were thrilling, every effect was intense and kept me completely on the edge. The title TENET was another bright puzzle, the significance was very clever. The director always manages to sneak in the major emotional theme behind the literal one, like he did in his latest films and it is one of the things that makes him my favorite director.The composer Ludwig Göransson sets greatly the sci-fi in its thriller and the concept of time. I liked the theme and not only the script keeps one on edge it was also with the help of his music. Even though I liked it I wanted something more and ever since it was known that Hans Zimmer will not be the composer I was on the fence for the music of this film. I love the partnership between Christopher Nolan and Hans Zimmer, both of them help each other to create greatness. Even though Hans Zimmer wasn't the composer Ludwig Göransson did a great job but still, his music was missing a lot of things. Ludwig Göransson had set the TENET theme but the composer failed to create themes for one to feel the emotions of the characters through music, a mistake that Hans Zimmer wouldn't have made because Hans Zimmer is known to have more than one theme in a film. I will always wonder what would Hans Zimmer bring to the table for this film, such a shame no one will ever find out.I was disappointed in the end credits because I always love to stay until the very end to enjoy the music but I was shocked that the first music was a song called The Plan by Travis Scott. The rhythm syncs perfectly with the film and the lyrics but the vocal music didn't fit at all. This film shouldn't have vocal music no matter if it was only used on the end credits. Thankfully it was only one and the second music was the score for the film that was the way that should have started the end credits.The cast was out of this world! especially John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki, and Kenneth Branagh, they all deserve to be recognized for their phenomenal performances. The scenes between John David Washington and Robert Pattinson flowed naturally and their interactions are an absolute enjoyment. I hope that Christopher Nolan's future project would add Elizabeth Debicki since he is known for using the same actors. She was mesmerizing I wanted more scenes for her but I understand that in this kind of story her scenes were fair but she deserves to have more and hopefully, this wouldn't be the last time he cast her in his films."
1280,"To be honest, it got me confused when I first watched this movie in the theater. Additionally, I wrongly chose the 4-D vision, which let me feel dizziness both mentally and physically.Surprisingly, in this movie, Nolan, the director, did not use actors who appeared in his movie before since Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy often act in Nolan's movie. Robert Pattinson, the old days' vampire prince, showed strong performance to the world to let audience realize that apart from the pretty face, the acting ability is also excellent.The detail is noticed and controlled considerably by the director. Despite it is difficult to understand backwards time, many details about the theory is well designed. For example, when Sator interrogated the Protagonist, it is the translation came first followed by the words speak by Sator, which is inverse to the reality.It might be wrong for us to use the normal thoughts to try to figure out the backwards time. Like the movie says, do not try to understand it. There was another movie, Arrival, which told the audience try to use circle thoughts instead of the linear way. Though I viewed Arrival years ago, I still do not know the how to implement the idea expressed in that movie.Though it confused me a lot and many parts were figured out when I watched it again, I still rated 8 points to this movie, because the masterpieces made by Nolan let me trust his consideration. His movie can bring new thoughts and new ideas towards the world to me always. This reverse time travel truly let me recognize the variety of time travel than just following the linear time. Therefore, I choose to believe that the reason of confusion might be our thought cannot catch up the consideration of Nolan or we might need to use a different approaches to think things like I mentioned above. The same confusion might happen to the first audience who watched the movie, Back to the Future in 1980s. And after several years, when we look back at this movie, we might take its logic and find it is a pioneer for the next development revolution in human history."
1281,Absolutely amazing. Great film. One of Nolan's best. The acting is great. The plot is out of this world with a perfect execution. Masterpiece of a film.
1282,Must watch twice.if you want to watch it only once.. Then your eyes have to on the screen at least 2h 30m.
1283,"Gave the two stars for the opening sequence in the opera house, which was intriguing and tense. After that, it was all downhill for me. I described this film as a James Bond film, where James Bond (Washington) goes to somewhere to meet someone, then he goes to somewhere else to get a thingy, and so on, and in every location, there's a plane crash, a car chase, a boat race and so forth.Here, interspersed we have some sort of inverted time plot that tries to be intelligent but is really quite nonsensical.At 1 hour and 45 minutes into it, I had lost the will to live.Previous reviewers mentioned the bad sound choices, explosions and sound track too loud, dialogue muffled and usually unintelligeble (if ever it made any sense, which I doubt sincerely, still, it would have been nice to be able to hear it).I will also add the total lack of human traits in the characters, notably the two main protagonists, notably the star/hero (Washington). I'm shaking my head as I'm writing this.I would also say that Brennagh's performance was incredibly disappointing. Not once did I feel real menace from him. I have no idea what happened, he has proven he can act, and I think this may be an indication of the essential problem with this movie.The director failed to elicit performances from the actors; had no interest in the characters, was too focused on the special effects and clearly in love with this inversion thing.If you go nuts at the idea of time inversion, this is the movie for you. If you don't, well ... good luck to you."
1284,"Original, enthralling, challenging.Nolan does it again. Like his other two time-bending masterpieces, Inception and Interstellar, Tenet asks a lot of the audience. You won't get the plot if you don't also grasp the director's approach to time as a literal physical property and that information is forever.If you don't want to be challenged by a complex plot intertwined with a scientific ""what if'"", then this isn't for you. You'll leave the theater and write a one star review of the movie saying stupid stuff like ""this isn't scientifically possible"".With Tenet, Nolan solidifies his status as Hollywood's leading auteur filmmaker.By the way, Tenet gets better with subsequent viewings."
1285,"I have been so excited for this film all year, I love Christopher Nolan, and I was so disappointed that you cannot hear a word anyone says. I understand the intense sound with films like Dunkirk, where it's all about immersion, but this film is closer to inception but virtually all the dialogue was blocked out by giant subwoofer noises. I don't even know what John David Washington's characters name is because I couldn't hear it, no idea who Aaran Taylor-Johnson or those soldiers were, couldn't hear! It felt like such a colossal waste of money, I almost walked out.It seemed like a very clever film, I'm sure it has a very interesting plot, and I will certainly watch it on a tv with subtitles when I can. It is NOT worth wasting your money to see in the cinema, you'll have a much better time if you wait for the DVD."
1286,"As I left the screening of Christopher Nolan's new mind-melter, looking around at my mother and sister, we all asked the same question: ""What did we just watch, and what was the point?"". Often with Nolan's films, you are left bemused until the final moments, where the overarching plot pieces fall into place, just as you were beginning to lose hope. Tenet does not have this - instead, the film is built around one time-travel gimmick that does little more than stage some cool reversed fight sequences, and wholly lacks the substantial plot to warrant a film.I love Christopher Nolan's films (Interstellar and The Dark Knight are two of my favourites), and even those films I didn't like I appreciate for what they are: in kind, I was enthralled by the first 15 minutes of explosions, fights and Nolan-esque drama (try making a torture scene PG-12 like he does, borderline impossible). Past there, Tenet seems more like an idea that spiralled out of hand, playing directly to the director's modus operandi without any studio executives saying, ""Isn't this plot a little rubbish?"". Decent acting (bar Kenneth Branagh as a Russian oligarch - seriously, just cast someone Russian and not awful?) and strong CGI does not mitigate the cardinal sin of films - a bad underlying plot.Lets look at some of the basic flaws. For one, the film gives you zero time to breathe. I would rather a film that is 30 minutes longer and develops the characters properly, instead of this jumble of fights/threats/cutscenes. Further to this, the timeframes in Tenet were so bizarre; no timescale was hinted to in some scenes, making everything even more convoluted when following an already non-linear story. Compounding this issue are the absolutely pointless characters (if you really consider it, the Indian Mafia could have been cut with no loss to the story), along with the mother of all cop-outs, a McGuffin ""algorithm"" object that has no relevance other than to help viewers grasp the potential of nuclear holocaust. There were other bad flaws, but if I keep writing them I might have an aneurism.I wanted to like Tenet - I wanted to love it - but below the surface it just didn't have anything that sets it apart from your run-of-the-mill jumbled story. Even those people I've spoken to who loved it couldn't really tell me why, nor could they fully explain the plot. I think this, however, is something up for debate: should a film be entirely understandable from the first watch? I will happily admit that Inception (another Nolan piece) has improved for me upon further viewings, but there was still enough from the initial watch that I could delineate what the story was. Tenet fails on this count, and I think Nolan should chalk this up as a failure. - HLO"
1287,"Whoever did the sound mixing should be fired. The sounds and music were far louder than the dialogue which made it impossible to tell what anyone was saying. As for the story itself, I found it gimmicky, simplistic and predictable. I admire the amount of work that went into bringing this idea to life, especially the technical aspect which was perfectly executed with visual amazement and action. However, it felt like an artificial and forced physics demonstration with very jumpy pacing more than a genuine story with an emotional core. At times it dabbles in a bit of character depth (Elizabeth Debicki's character being the real star here) but this is balanced by some rather baffling or blunt moments as well. It was fun to watch this movie imagining that Washington's protagonist is actually the same as his character from BlacKkKlansman (2018)."
1288,"If you want to watch an action movie, it is a good one. Just watch and do not think as the story/plot is terrible.
With all the loud noise it was promoted expected a lot more of it, especially story/plot wise."
1289,Cool movie and intent movie it was an awesome movie
1290,"When Tom Cruise went to the movies to watch this film I bet the entire time he was thinking 'I do this one hundred percent better!' And he would be right, one thousand percent better. Nolan has great ideas, very smart man, an artist, but his films are really boring. He is the un-entertainment man. But you know what to expect when you go to see his films. I never learn."
1291,"The movie is not that hard to understand, especially when you can literally guess the plot. Those plot twists (I suppose?) like the protagonist was fighting himself at the Freeport, the woman jumping off the boat was Kat herself, and it was the protagonist who recruited Neil... I sensed all that when those scene first happened, I watched the movie with my mom and she told me she saw them coming as well, too cliche!And the physics part, inverted entropy, anti-matter, time travel, blah blah blah, it could be a very cool concept for a sci-fi movie but unfortunately remains a wasted potential. I have a BSc in physics and now a PhD student in nuclear engineering, I feel frustrated with how the movie dealt with those concept. Just imagine remove all that from the movie, simply be like, the villain has a weapon of mass destruction, both sides have time travel technology, how is this gonna be any different? Not much, right?Tenet is a typical Hollywood solo-hero-save-the-world (and the girl) action movie with predictable ending which I didn't expect from Nolan. To be honest I would give it a 10/10 if the ending was the world actually ended with Andrei's death and we got to see a whole new world of inverted physics and time."
1292,"It's almost impossible for someone to go and watch this for the first time and understand every bit of detail. What I enjoyed about the film is that even if there are points where you can't follow along, the movie allows you to pick yourself back up as it progresses.
Visually, it is INCREDIBLE and very unlike other movies you've ever seen, guaranteed. Fantastic box office film. There are some cheesy moments, but it's very difficult to introduce the premise without it. Not all of us have a ""master's in physics"" haha.
Whatever these critics are saying, don't believe it. You WILL miss out on an incredible watch if you don't watch it in the theaters (especially in IMAX)...unless you have your own home theater, of course."
1293,"Seeing Tenet finally being released in the UK,I looked up details of it being shown in IMAX, (well aware of the film makers love for the format) and was thrilled to find that half the movie was in that format. A fan of the director, I booked a ticket at the Manchester IMAX Vue in The Printworks, (the second biggest screen in Europe) and got set to turn back time.View on the film:Later revealing that he based his take on the character on author Christopher Hitchens, (most noticeable in his mannerism and accent)Robert Pattinson gives a exuberant performance as Neil, whose fight to straighten time out is charged by a slippery confidence of Neil not revealing all his cards to the audience.Picking up the mission file from Sir Michael, John David Washington gives a brooding turn as ""The Protagonist"", giving the action scenes a real grit by fighting tooth and nail,along with a intense urgency to turn the clocks.Igniting his experimentation of compressed sound with gunfire landing to Ludwig Goransson's thrashing score, and not containing any green screen shots, writer/directing auteur Christopher Nolan reunites with cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema, and continues to explore the manipulation of time in film he first clicked in Memento (2000) in a spectacular fashion.Nolan and Hoytema turn the clocks with mesmerising in-camera tricks panning the camera over alterations in time,rising to long crane shots gliding across vast action set-pieces running under a powder keg
timer. Keeping up close to Neil & The Protagonist ,Nolan hits a winning punch with a ground and pound mood unleashed in narrow corridor tracking shots striking a immerse atmosphere from the camera winding backwards to Neil and The Protagonist's fight to stop the final countdown."
1294,"A bit disappointed with the many mistakes and things that just doesn't make any sense.1. Fingers crossed and say ""Tenet"". Explained once on the boat, never used that sign again. Basically a pointless twist.
2. Why would our protagonist try to shoot himself in the head during the scene where one is in black military outfit and the other in the fancy suit.
3. The movie establish a rule that in order to survive inversion, you must wear a safety mask for breathing (unless your in a fancy container). Fair enough, but several times this rule is broken. Kat is inverted and is back on the yacht, she doesn't wear a mask at any point.
4. Inverted people and non-inverted people experience each other differently. So why is Kat not spotted by Andrei back on the yacht? she would be moving in visibly different ways compared to Andrei.Interesting idea with inversion and time travel, but I don't like when the movie break its own set of rules then it just becomes a bad movie."
1295,You should watch it twice.Brilliant movie. New take on time travel. Just pure WOW.
1296,"Tenet - one-word Masterpiece. I was excited for Nolan movies always to see his extraordinary screenplay and stories. It is one of the best things to do it again. John, Pattinson, Elizabeth done their roles very well. Especially music is awesome and carries movies in a calm way. Two flight scenes are the best, Car flight and the climax :)
One thing I could say about the movie, Don't try to understand too much about tenets. What was happened and it has happened. Time vs survival concept and looks in a cool way :)
I would recommend watching in IMAX. Movies make more difference with sounds. If someone want to understand clearly this movie. there are two options, one is watching two or more times. Another idea is you have to watch back, like 150 min to 0 min. You could understand everything. That's how Nolan creativity worked in this movie :)Enjoy the movie and have fun."
1297,"Bored me to pieces at least 30 mins to an hour in, very long winded bad copy of the matrix. I'd have walked out the cinemas if I wasn't with my mate. Never again!"
1298,"Critics and people who didn't understand the film are rating it at its low.. as far i know this movie is definitely not Nolan's best or a masterpiece . But don't get me wrong this movie is easily in my top 10 . I have seen many time travel films.. like many .. and 90% of time travel movies are .. eh.. but this one is not one of them.. ofcourse this movie is dealing with future , present , past alot.. and will confuse u alot .. I mean alot....but it all makes perfect sense no paradoxes etc etc..I rated it 10 not cuz I am a nolanfan cuz I am a cinema fan who encourage original movies and especially movie like tenet which is amazing and jaw dropping.. it deserves... Nolan is a genuis that he pulled out a perfect time travel movie which even biggest movie failed (endgame) OFCOURSE tenet is not a straight time travel it's time Inversion.. it's kinda different from any other..
And watch it twice maybe thrice to get it"
1299,"The movie goes too fast and it's really hard to follow.
It is entertaining but that's all. Not a good script, and not a good plot."
1300,"As expected a great movie. Nolan never ceases to surprise us. This film has been put together so well and extensively.I see a lot of people saying it is very ""difficult"" to understand, but a little viewer of Nolan can understand this. Second time viewing is even better. It is and remains fantastic how well this is put together."
1301,"Christopher Nolan has done it again.
Going in, I was afraid that this film might've lost its Christopher Nolan ""touch"" (especially after seeing some disappointed reviews), but every single thing felt unbelievably like Nolan, and I have no doubt when I say that absolutely no one but him would've been able to pull something like this off.
The only shortfall this movie has (in my opinion), is that, unlike Inception, the viewer gets very few explanations about what is actually happening and is dropped into this world without getting more details. Details that are unfortunately crucial to understanding, and most importantly, enjoying a movie. I'd consider myself a nolan fan, so there's some bias on my side as to why nolan withheld explanations and as to why he decided that this was the way this concept and script were to be made into a film. Iwas initially afraid that Nolan might've gone over the top with this movie (mostly in terms of action sequences), but now I feel like he's gone a little over the top with the complexity and especially the lack of explanation of a film. Although there's nothing better than a movie that keeps you thinking about it for days (like this one most probably will), I needed a bit more understandable explanations to nudge me to a possible interpretation. As a consequence, I wish there had been more dialogues, and especially more dialogues that would've felt relevant and important to the story. The soundtrack didn't disappoint me, but it also didn't stand out to me as much as the soundtracks in other Nolan films. Ludwig Göranssom used a certain theme a few times, and it was the exact same theme used in the trailer and other promotional material, so it kind of felt a little overplayed to me. Nonetheless, the soundtrack was amazing in that it added incredible tension and almost another dimension to an already infinitely complicated movie.
Nevertheless, like I mentioned, this movie couldn't possibly feel more like a Christopher Nolan project; the script, cinematography, editing and performances were (as always) impeccable.
All in all, an incredible movie with an even more incredible and unprecedented concept, which unfortunately also became its very little, but unignorable flaw."
1302,This film started off slow and about half way through it really picks up the very first scene where you see the protagonist trying to safe those people was such an awesome action sequence it is one of many amazing action sequences throughout the film what the director presents us with is to question reality and the concept of time which makes you rethink both of those possibilities with all of this in mind the cinematography and the characters within the story and everyone involved in the making of this film drives the story forward as there are many twists and turns and as you get through the story slowly everything in front of you starts to make sense and everything slowly gets explained to us the viewers I would highly recommend checking this film out
1303,Christopher Nolan thinks he's clever. He's not. Disjointed incoherent rubbish.
1304,"This film will have to be watched multiple times to be completely appreciated. I am a fan of Nolan, but I made an effort to view this film as itself alone, with no comparisons or bias judgment (or as little as possible). Even now I'm not satisfied with one viewing, as there is just so much sewn into the story/physics and timelines of this film. Though I can confidently say from the beginning to end, this film was the complete polar opposite of disappointing. Reviews say the story is hard to follow, I can somewhat support this by saying that there are many deliberate and abrupt cuts between scenes that people may find offsetting, but this is by design as I strongly believe the pace of the movie requires this, additionally the logic behind the concept of inversion would be difficult for most to grasp especially at a fast pace, but you can still appreciate the story without fully understanding the ins and outs of inversion and I think he's done very very well to explain and guide audiences through this. don't expect to completely understand it on the first watch, this isn't a ""mainstream"" Hollywood blockbuster everyone is so accustomed to. This is an intricate, extremely well thought out, fast paced mind melting film that has you walking out the cinema in awe. Nolan fans will thoroughly enjoy every minute of this. It is so thrilling to see how inversion plays out in each scene, pretty astonishing and overwhelming, especially with the music - which might I say is extremely integral to this movies intensity. Some of the music is unlike anything you've heard before, innovative and captivating. The cinematography is visceral and the environments are amazing. Movie keeps you on your toes the whole way, only you have to be conscious about keeping up with some of the dialogue, some of it is spoken pretty fast. You've got a rollercoaster to look forward to if you're considering watching this."
1305,This movie is perfect. I'm sorry you don't get it. Don'd it against the movie if you can't keep up.
1306,"Do not waste your time on this movie. Worse movie we have ever seen to say the least. Storyline was all over the place. It seemed that when the editors edited the movie, they spliced out the important parts, one would hope! Also, the background music was so LOUD that you could hardly hear the actors speaking.
What a waste of money."
1307,"Loved, loved, loved the movie! The only thing in didn't understand is why they didn't cast a Russian actor, or someone who speaks Russian, or someone that can do a great accent. Although a few times his accent wasn't that bad, the other times made me cringe.Other than that, great movie! So many clues and details! I advice you watch the movie two times, so you can really understand it!"
1308,"The shear spectacle of this film is groundbreaking. Thank god for nolan for bringing us original films in a generation of superheros and remakes.This is basically a bond movie with on shrooms. my only complaint was the sound mixing, the first half of this music I couldn't understand what the characters were saying which left me confused , but the second half is AMAZING. I probably have to watch this at least 2 more times to really understand it."
1309,"I'm a Nolan fan, but he missed the mark here. There were too many holes, and too little excitement. UGH!"
1310,The background noise and music were constant and at least as loud as the dialogue through the entire film. Neither myself or my husband could understand what was being said through most of the movie.
1311,"It's a bit like Inception reloaded. Interesting story, however the motivation of the characters fails grip. So the whole violence gets boring after a while, especially in the second half."
1312,"I don't care if you're a Nolan fan, if you really make an objective movie evaluation, there's no way you can consider this a good film.
The plot is hard to follow, but that was not my main complaint about this. The fact is that Nolan had so much writing to stuff into this movie that the 2h30 weren't nearly near enough to the time he needed. So, it ends up as an action and visual effects packed film that resembles a 007 wannabe and with the actores talking so fast that makes the movie appear to be running in fast forward. With that, we lose the sense of drama from the physics' explanation of the idea and also is almost impossible to consider whether the actors are any good or not. Just imagine if Star Wars 1, 2 and 3 had to be condensed in a 2h30 movie and i'm pretty sure they would never be such pop culture icons as they are. Nolan tries once more to present us with a head scratching movie idea (as he did in Inception or Interstellar), but the presentation is lousy, making it, in my opinion, a bad, bad movie."
1313,"I don't want to tell you to much what this movie is about, because I'm afraid I'll tell you the whole story. Tenet is one those movies you need to pay close attention in order to understand the premise.
The mixing of a spy thriller with some sci elements is quite brilliant, has writer director Christopher Nolan can do it best. Action scenes are amazing, and keep you on the edge, and effects here are quite beyond spectacular. There are surprises here that not many critics will see comings. John David Washington is awesome, so is Robert Pattinson, and let's not forget about Elizabeth Debicki. But it's Kenneth Branagh that really takes the picture, with his brilliant acting."
1314,Christopher nolan breaks up everything and amazing
1315,"I waited six months to see a movie, and this is what you gave me, Christopher Nolan?? This was a mess. I can follow complex plots (I watched 3 seasons of Dark on Netflix and I understood at least most of it). This was just a disaster. From cliche storytelling (a Russian oligarch and his damsel-in-distress wife?) to a bloated budget that answered the question ""What would happen if Chris Nolan made a Fast & Furious movie?"" Car chase, car chase, stunts, guns, fights, boat race (I think?), More car chases, more guns. ***spoiler*** Thanos , I mean Sator gets all the infinity stones. The end. What??"
1316,This film is one of the most great films of nolan it was complex and default to understand but amazing and great film
1317,Words cannot describe this movie. Christopher Nolan will go down in history. John David Washington showing why he is the next household name in Hollywood. Robert Pattinson shutting up all the haters and showing them he is back better than ever. Once you can rap your head around this movie you clearly know this is yet another masterpiece from Nolan.
1318,Reading through these I see a lot of people saying it's hard to understand and that's why they didn't like it.Jesus that's why I loved it. Half of the crap we watch nowadays is so stupid and predictable and it seems like anytime someone attempts to make a movie that requires even an ounce of thought everyone gets pissed. Just enjoy the fact that your watching a movie that you have to think about during. It's part of the fun.
1319,"Regardless of the main premise of the movie, what struck me the most was underwhelming acting from some of the actors very dear to me usually and horrible, horrible dialogues that made no sense at times and felt completely devoid of humanity.
Also, I would warn viewers not to fall into the ""oh this movie is so complicated so it must be deep and amazing"" trap. No, sometimes the viewer is not the problem. Sometimes the movie has an overinflated sense of self-worth"
1320,"The acting is great, in which Robert Pattinson excels in this one.
The action sequences are also nice, effects on level, but who'd expect any different.What's really bad is the storyline, the plot, the pretentious ""science"" explanations etc. It is impossible to follow when or how or why.Many reviews here say to watch it second time, now why would I do that??At one point someone says ""everything that existed destroyed"", response was ""and so is my son"". I laughed really hard there :).It's bad."
1321,"This movie reminded me of Avatar. Not the story, but a famous director who had this really big premise for a movie for years, but not a real story to tell, and then goes through various scripts in order to create a story to fit the premise. And he gets all the budget and creative freedom to make it happen. And it failed, there is clearly not a story on a human level to be told. What's left is a chaotic roller coaster which isn't even entertaining for the night like a silly B movie could be."
1322,"Watched for an hour but didn't understand what was going on, kept asking my partner but didn't wanna bother him every 10 minutes cause nothing just made sense. Wouldn't even want to watch it back again cause just wasn't interesting at all. Disappointed seeing as it has such a high rating."
1323,"Nolan got drunk on his own success: the movie is basicaly badly edited, with a devioused plot, and two and a half hours of money burning on the screen. The characters are VERY poor with no development whatsoever. The ""villain"" is one of the worst characters I have ever seen, very poorly driven in his evilness; which make him a very old kind of character (being evil for the sake of evil itself, with no other context that explains that will to destroy the world).
The plot is unintelligible, with a mix of danger-friendship-love and very questionable physics that has no good fit between itself.
Is like he tried to replicate Inception and Interstellar and Dunkirk in just one movie. It is rubbish. He is a real creative guy but he has his head in the clouds right now. I hope this puts his feet on the ground once again."
1324,"I am big fan of Nolan, but this movie disappointed.
Unnecessary complexity but action is awesome"
1325,"Nolan is surely a brilliant director, but he misfired this bullet...probably the inverted entropy concept, heightened/increased the overall Entropy of the movie ;) , thereby creating more disorder!In Asian spiritual culture, we say that in this world every good thing taken to extreme can also become more a burden, a deficit, a liability! Nolan is now maybe taking it too seriously (not sincerely!) and this has backfire here. The story is unnecessarily confusing, abrupt and uninteresting...on the acting front also we don't see any better outcomes. It felt actors were just blurting out the lines and seemed more disoriented, probably they themselves cdn't digest the concept...I will look out for the next one from Nolan. Humble suggestion - try a different genre this time - away from sci-fi, mind-bending stuff... :). Sorry Nolan, wanted to like it, but I want to be a unbiased and true admirer."
1326,"Don't let this film's surface crypticness fool you. It'll appear to suck, but that's only because ""it's inverted, it's entropy run backwards"". See, lines like that may appear to glow with juvenile wisdom that wannabe youngsters can swoon over and feel like a part of the 'in' crowd, but in reality it's a gem of imagination that will slowly dawn on you over time. When you watch it 6 times. Or, of course, you could find something more meaningful to do with your time."
1327,I was dying in first 30 minutes. Really trashy movie. Conversations are weird and fake.
1328,"I see people saying that you have to watch it twice to appreciate it! WHAT? It is the other way round. You watch a movie, appreciate it, and then watch it again because it was brilliant the first time! Audio is annoying, characters non existent and the plot... well..."
1329,"If you read the review under this title, you will quickly learn that the score of 7.7 is an imaginative number. I fell asleep during this movie and i'm a moviephile.The camera work, the plot, actors... pretty much everything feels thrown together by a production company to make a quick buck due to the Covid losses.I can take a lot, but this was below my limit in almost every way. When John David Washington tries to play a smart and sophisticated spy but walks and moves like a simple hood, not even a child would believe him.Worst movie experience in a long time."
1330,I stopped watching halfway. The background music drives you crazy. The typical crazed baddie with the good looking wife that he despises is predictable.The whole storyline is absurd.
1331,"The plot is so ridiculous that, apparently, nobody could figure out how to film it coherently. So they went for muddled, to obscure the inanity.The characters are solid cardboard, and the supporting writing is no better. Formula lines abound.Worst of all is the acting, and the worst among the weak is the lead ""Protagonist"". Washington has almost no natural talent and has been allowed to show it. He delivers his lines with no pacing, thought, body language or anything else. With no help from the director as proven by the fact that *all* the cast does this - even Michael Caine.Don't waste your time on this silly disappointment."
1332,"After all it's Nolans work so the story is twisted, confusing and mind blowing as usual. The movie is terrific with action and keeps you on edge every second of it. But while watching it i got a glimpse of movie named 'looper' in a certain way only far more complex and intriguing. A must watch for Nolans work so as it is said you don't miss the best..."
1333,I feel they deliberately made it such complicated to force us to watch it twice and earn double income.
1334,"Dear Chris,
We get it. You're very intelligent and possess an outstanding power of imagination. However, this trend is wearing off, and your audience awaits something more. Maybe you're the one responsible for setting the bar so high. Either way, your latest movie had nothing innovative (by your standards) to offer, and the picture's FX and score were the only admirable aspects of Tenet."
1335,"As other reviewers have said, it's ""manic"" and so poor in character development that you just don't care what happens to any of them. I want to add that the evil Russian mob guys were disgusting and too unclean/rough compared with the other characters. Even with all the cool sci-fi elements/effects/action, I still didn't care what happened in the story and stopped watching before half-way. Inception was much better. We cared about Cobbs character in Inception. Deja Vu is also a much better sci-fi movie with a 'Denzel Washington-type' character as lead (like Tenet) that you actually care about. I recommend not wasting any money on Tenet at all. And don't even bother to try watching it twice, hoping it's better the second time."
1336,"An emotionless story with a gimmick. It's really not interesting. The 'effects' are kinda lame, but kind of interesting. You spend your time wondering what idiot made this movie. It's Pretty Garbage."
1337,"At many points throughout this film the screenplay felt like it was intended to be a Christopher Nolan parody, particularly with the ""mysterious"" mystique they intended for the protagonist. ""Tenet"" just felt like a forced Nolan product. It is definitely still quality and very entertaining with it's top notch cinematography, unusual (weird Hanz Zimmer knockoff) sound environment and a typical mind bending Nolan premise. But for me, this is a bottom tier Nolan film and maybe the worst creation by the astounding director. I was also very underwhelmed with the performance of John David Washington. Major step down from his top notch display in the Black Klansman."
1338,"This really is a movie that is not for everyone, but I really enjoyed this movie. I had the abilty to watch this movie twice in imax and I saw it with subtitles, so I didnt have any problems with loud noises and also, the music is awesome, Ludwig Goransson did a great job of composing amazing music for the movie. I also love that the movie is complex, its like a puzzle and after watching it twice, I kind of solved it. I understand that some people dont like that and thats ok, like I said its not for everyone. But if you are interested in this movie and you have the chance to see it, I really recommend it!"
1339,The movie is fantastic. You just need something between your ears to see it. Clearly many people lack any sort of brains in this world. (Probably American).
1340,"I love complex movies, but the workflow and segways are just all-over the place. Scenes switch and you find yourself asking questions that just don't get answered.This is certainly the worst cut in history. Memento is extremely easy to follow compared to this."
1341,"I couldn't make sense of this film even with subtitles, not because of the constant dribble they talk, but due to the lack of clarity in pronunciation. Some of the actors, like J.D. Washington, badly need enunciation lessons.Then the scene with Michael Caine and JD Washington at the restaurant seems as if the two actors hadn't filmed it together, because there is not a single camera frame showing they are seated at the same table at the same time. Check it out and you will see for yourself. Then in that restaurant scene the cameraman drove my eyes nuts: the camera was trained on either of them for every single line they said. In that single short scene the camera bounces off from actor to actor more than thirty times. Crazy for the eyesight. It puts you to sleep in the hours of darkness if you are lying in bed or lying on the couch after a copious lunch.The storyline unfolds at the speed of light which makes it so convoluted that even subtitles won't help you make sense of it all. You have to have a degree in physics. I don't think that will even help.If you are having trouble getting off to sleep one night or have run out of sleeping pills, play this film for five minutes and the constant switch in camera angles will make your eyes roll and you will be out for the count in less than five minutes.Do not waste your time on this film which could have had more potential if they had dumbed down the script and hired a different cameraman."
1342,"Very promising but falls so flat and honestly it doesn't manage to convince me that it makes any sense at all - unlike other Nolan materpieces
Watch for explosions, well choreographed fight scenes and the super budget, but NOT for an exciting story and a memorable experience"
1343,"It's 2020. Cars without airbags? Abs? Auto braking? Not to mention a car reaching highway speeds in reverse?
I know, it's a tuff time Hollywood, but..."
1344,"The worst film of the year. And unfortunately also the longest. 2h30 lost watching laughable talks which make no sense, and noisy action breaking all the laws of physics, but also the rules of logic. It was a real pain staying to the end, and the need for fresh air was high after such garbage. So, fine, they have saved the world, but not my evening."
1345,"Great cinematography, good acting, mediocre writing, bad editing, terrible mixing. Skip it."
1346,"When you have an unfamiliar topic, and very technical, that's when having an familiar actor that isn't so technical to do the part, that way it slows it down for us to enjoy... Also being with an english accent, it makes the movie boring and tedious... Washington is not that good of an actor, you could see his newness to the acting world as his temperament was sensitive...without spoilers.. involving the woman didn't give any different outcome whether she took one for the team would have been better, not a great actress, very boring...lets not hope being sequels... everything is reverse is a waste of time."
1347,"One of the few movies in 2020 that makes u hold your breathe, dont wanting it to end.Get subtitles and echo a few scenes and dialogues, Nolan introduces some new concepts to our old worn plasticity.Pure mind expansion."
1348,"This film, is stupid. I was wondering if i was the only one it wasnt making sense too, but it seems others on here agree with me....i dont think its well made, what are examples of good scifi? the matrix? inception? it is trying HARD to be inception, but fails.....its like half straight to vid half cinema release, the action scenes with the main character were good. but i kept not hearing what he said......again others are saying the same on here.i'm not sure if its the actors bad annunciation or bad sound..i thought the trailer looked lame, i was right.,,,its like one of those overly complex films, that only people who want to look clever like. i gave it 4..."
1349,"Very good action but needed subtitles to understand sound. Very long movie, plot is obvious in some parts and incomprehensible in others. Oh, is there a plot?
We got about 1/2 way through and fell asleep. Picked up the next day. This is the movie that was going to save the studios? No way!"
1350,I only gave 4 Stars because of the cool Concept going forward and backwards in time! But except massive setpieces and awesome innovative actions scenes there is no real story worth telling. Also the structure is too confuseing for a feature movie. The concept would be better for a tv show.
1351,"Look. I welcome any scifi movie but this seems to be a science fiction going wayyyyy too technical for viewers. It is like Interstellar x 10. It is hard to follow the movie with time going back and forth, and not only that the reverse flow gets confusing as hell. Either that or I am dumb.No recommended for normal human beings."
1352,"Much has been written in previous user reviews on Tenet, and there's probably not much more that can be said on its merits (for those who loved it) and flaws (for those who didn't). As for my feelings on it, let me use a bit of the Tenet logic to best articulate where I stand.In the RED timeline, you go to the theater, plonk down your money for a ticket, and proceed to watch a movie that tries hard to do something new, even at the cost of its coherence. You come away likely confused and underwhelmed.In the BLUE timeline, you sit in a theater confused and underwhelmed, proceed to endure a movie that tries to do something new, even at the cost of its coherence, but get paid money afterwards.All things considered, after watching this movie, I wish I had been in the BLUE timeline instead of the RED."
1353,"I was really enjoying this but was noticing some scenes were very difficult to make out what was being said. There was one scene, three of them chatting in a city street but it was hard to make out, then they go sailing and it ruined any enjoyment i had as it was so hard to hear.I will revisit this but with subtitles."
1354,"We were a few in the cinema as people isn't going as it used to, late nite function. We all commented the movie while going out of the cinema, nobody got it. I don't enjoy a product I can't handle and makes me feel stupid on purpose, and if after reading a single review the storyline seems way more clear my main conclusion is the movie won't show or explain things as it's supposed to. I don't want everything obvious, but there's a limit, loved interstellar, enjoyed inception but this one was just too much too keep my attention."
1355,"Now, I am a fan of Christopher Nolan movies and I know his movies can be bit complex. So I was prepared for a mind bending flick. But Tenet was way more complex than I thought it would be. I went to the theatre with my wife to watch this movie and throughout the movie we were asking each other what is going on. The whole time I was trying to connect the sequences.
Sound is bad. Background music makes it hard to understand what the characters are saying. This movie certainly needs rewatch. Now-a-days it's already hard to manage time for new movies, I am afraid if I can manage time to rewatch this one. I don't think this movie deserves 7.8 rating in IMDB."
1356,"Back to the future 2 meets edge of tomorrow, so basically time cop buddy flick made high brow.Could have done with a laugh track.Needed more Biff Tannen, less Doc Brown."
1357,The film was way too loud! Hard to follow like most Christopher Nolan films so I'm definitely going to have to watch this at home with caption! The tall blond didn't really fit the role to me. Sometimes John Washington would sound like a robot maybe bc he sound a lot like his father to me. And the vampire lover boy from Twilight (Patterson) stole the show!
1358,Excellent movie! But the sound could've been better...
1359,"I love mindbending movies and Nolan's timebending Memento and Interstellar, but this went too far. So far I can't figure out what happened.
What I love in mindbending timetravel films is the hability to unveil the true narrative plot after the end and in a second time I see them. When it makes sense, even if hard to get, it's wonderful.
I can't make much sense of what's happening in backwards. Maybe it's me. Maybe this film is ahead of my time. Maybe ahead of our time. Maybe a few years from now, the world goes so fast we start rewinding to see what's happening. I need to see this a second or third time, but maybe in another time."
1360,"So I knew going in that this movie would blow my brain away with it's ideas and that it would be very pretty and well filmed. I think that every thing about the story was well thought out and really liked the way the inversion worked. If you are a fan of time travel movies, this one is another to add to your masterfully done movies collection.I do have one thing keeping this movie from being a really excellent movie. Some thing that hindered my enjoyment of The Dark Knight Rises, Interstellar and now Tenet. Christopher Nolan needs to get some one new to do his sound work or he needs hearing aids. Though most of this movie is had to guess what was being said. I kind of wish I could read lips, that really might have helped. I know that there are parts where I shouldn't be able to hear someone clear as a bell and I accept that, but even in some of the non action scenes it was really hard to hear what was being said.I suppose that the theater might have done something to the sound settings or maybe I am just getting old, but I don't have problems with other movies or TV, so why is it that mostly just those 3 movies, Rises, Interstellar, Tenet, do I experience the problem of hearing the characters? I really want to enjoy a Christopher Nolan movie, not struggle to understand it because I can't hear the characters talk."
1361,"So if you're expecting a complex and engaging puzzle, don't. This is a more or less generic action movie right down to the evil Russian guy who will destroy the world. The time travel ( inversion ) is a neat gimmick, but it doesn't create any intriguing mystery, it merely sets up some nifty cinematography. It felt slow at times and i checked my watch more then once. It probably deserves a second watch, but I won't be to surprised if it remains opaque and somewhat contrived."
1362,"Another mindbender from Nolan who playfully fiddles with time, tokens and your imagination.Nearly every scene is given different context by the end of the film from how you interpret it.I have marked this review as spoilers. Which probably means it won't have much use to anyone thinking of seeing it. I don't think you want to over think watching this film for the first time. Thats for the second or third viewings.Will eventually make the studio a ton of money"
1363,I don't actually write reviews on IMDb unless absolutely forced to. This movie. Forced. My. Hand.This is absolutely by far one of the WORST movies I have ever seen. I watched all the trailers and couldn't dissect any sort of plot line what-so-ever. Surprise surprise. This movie sucked. No plot what so ever.Cool cinematics and from what I under stand about reading about the movie is: how the forwards and backwards scenes were created - kudos to the actors and editors. Save your movie and google these scenes. You won't spoil a thing. There is no plot to spoil!
1364,Total dog crap of a movie. It was masterfully marketer and the soundtrack is great but the actual movie stinks like day old vomit.
1365,"My TENET Review
Film: 8/10
Pros & Cons:
(Minor spoilers)PROS:
1. The movie was visually and musically stunning! Every scene was shot unbelievably good, it's very well made with heavy awesome music playing throughout the intense scenes. This film was mostly shot with an IMAX camera and man you can tell. Instead of Hans Zimmer doing the soundtrack it's actually Ludwig Göransson, which is the composer of Black Panther and the Mandalorian which gives the film a different feel but SUPER cool.2. Good story with a great cast. The characters in the film become friends as your watching the movie progress it's great to watch. John David Washington is a good actor along with Robert Pattinson, Kenneth Branagh as the villain and even Elizabeth Debicki really shines. Even though there aren't a lot of cast members, they are very good at what they do and deliver an intense cool story.3. If you love Christopher Nolan movies, you will love this one. He combines the Dark Knight Rises with Inception and Memento altogether. Not really so much Dunkirk and Interstellar though. He has a feel to his movies and you can definitely tell that you're watching a Chris Nolan movie, so for all the fans it makes you feel like you're watching another masterpiece again and you pretty much are.CONS:
1. Yes the rumors are true that it is very confusing. I was able to follow along for a long time but there was moments that I did get lost. There were times I was explaining what was going on to my sister sitting next to me and then times where she was explaining what was going on to me. It's very helpful to see the movie with a friend so that both of you can catch different things and then talk about it when the movie is over. In order to fully understand you have to watch the movie multiple times, but then again it is Nolan.2. The cast is small. Although the people that are in the movie do a good job, there aren't many big name people. When you're watching Inception it's a group of like five or six of them but this one isn't a whole squad it's very few people which if you're not into the main two to three characters you're not going to enjoy the film. The film would've been a lot better if he had cast just a couple more cool actors or actresses to join the heroes.3. We needed subtitles. There are a lot of scenes where the boys are wearing some kind of military or medical mask with accents and then they throw in dialogue on top of it. You have no idea what they're saying in some of the scenes. And if I remember correctly John David Washington is the only main character that actually has an American accent so if you're good with accents it won't bother you but there are countless other accents in the film which makes it extremely hard for some Americans to understand and really need subtitles. There were entire conversation scenes that were lost to me because I couldn't understand.All in all it was an amazing film though, better than Dunkirk in my opinion but not quite as good as The Dark Knight. If you are a fan of Christopher Nolan like I said you'll love this movie, you'll buy it on DVD put the subtitles on and watch it countless times over the years until you're a pro at mastering this plot. Much like all his other films it's really fun, super cool, has great music and a definite must see movie worth going back to theaters for."
1366,"I almost walked out of the movie but decided to sit through it. The movie does not make sense, it is not well developed and none of the characters are developed one bit. Do not waste your time on this one"
1367,"The it frustration of you sense experience make reading and this movie sentence this is follow the to same trying frustration experience you will will you experience frustration trying same to the follow is this sentence movie this and reading make experience sense you of frustration it the. (reverse entropy?)TENET was to James Bond and Mission Impossible films, what a knock-off Luis Vutton bag would be compared to the real. It looks a LOT like the 100% genuine piece, but there are certain fine details and compromises in workmanship that make the knock-off fall short of the quality of the authentic piece.A 2.5 hour film should not feel like 2.5 hours when the viewer is immersed in the story, kept on the edge of their seat as they follow the twists and turns of the plot and find resolution to the actions, dialogue, and motives of the characters.But while watching TENET I felt every minute of that 2.5 hrs, and I found myself wishing the movie would go ahead and be over so I could go try to read something to help me understand what I had just watched. The director did not invest enough time and patience into deliberately breaking down the plot science, so that viewers like you and me who appreciate story immersion could at least be able to comprehend what we were watching without feeling confused and left out of the loop.This feeling of confusion and being 'lost' created an aggravating distraction from the movie experience. Eeven the car chases, fight scenes, and gun battles did not compensate for how the movie's fuzzy execution robs you of immersion.When you also add that the actors lines could barely be heard most of the time, and they hardly parted their lips to articulate their words, which made it a challenge to even read their lips when you couldn't hear their lines.Overall the I give 5 stars for the valiant effort to create an epic sci-fi blockbuster. But more effort time invested from the directors and editors, it very well could have been, but instead it fell far short as a noisy complicated, convoluted rough draft that needs someone else to go back and do it better."
1368,"Jesus what a let down. Chris nolan loved all his movies but this one was a huge let down. The whole concept of the movie is attempted to be explained but never does. You will leave the theatre questioning what the movie is about, that I can guarantee."
1369,"Really enjoyed it. The visuals were stunning. I saw it in a newly remodeled theater so I am only docking a star as it may have been the theater sound and not the movie. The foreign accents were very thick and hard to understand, including that characters all wore masks from time to time. If you hated Bane's mask in the DKR, than Chris has a whole new level of that irritation for you. Then the soundtrack was constantly playing throughout the movie. Sometimes they highlighted the track over the dialogue, and it wasn't so distracting as just another problem with hearing the dialogue. AND I think I needed to hear the dialogue, because I was lost so much of the time, in a good way, but I definitely missed the explanations for some of the things that were going on. It was wild and complex, and I'll need to see it another 5 x before I completely understand it. But the characters and the cinematography and editing, really did make you want to understand it. I would love to show this film to a class of 9 year olds and then assign them to write a synopsis of this film. Each of those papers would be a nugget of gold. :)"
1370,"I don't usually bother with reviews on IMDB as by the time I've seen films, y'all have beaten me to it with your faster fingers and I have nothing new to add. But everyone seems to have missed this plot hole that's big enough to drive a 10 ton truck, a fire truck, a BMW that's faster that it looks, and... Well, you get the idea. It's a doozy.I won't even bother with the minor 'nitpicks' (as my OH calls them) like if The Protagonist is fighting himself, why is he shooting at his head...?Look, Kat's entire story is crazy. She is a poor little rich girl, who we're supposed to feel sorry for because her billionaire husband is controlling. Not that shocking, not that sympathetic. Not much of a secret, either, if 'the help' know all about it and serve her paintings for breakfast. Not just her hubby that could blackmail her or get her sent to prison.She has a pathological obsession with her son, to the point where she apparently doesn't even see him as part of the whole universe, having to clarify that if it's destroyed, that will include him.Then, she's shot, and the movie doesn't even abide by it's own rules. The future is pushing back at us, but we're winning because there's more moving in our time flow. The Protagonist even gets told about drag being different when he's driving a car. So if everything is pushing against the inverted bullet, it would be LESS serious being shot by one than a 'normal' bullet.Assuming there are other reasons for that, as Kat is recuperating, she reveals that a man obsessed with his heart rate (why?) has cancer. So, she isn't trapped in a gilded cage after all. She just has to make nice with her husband for the sake of her son, who she beats us around the head with how much she loves, and then when hubby dies of cancer, she can take sole custody of the son and spend all the money. What exactly is The Protagonist saving her from now?I am now conflicted. I'd rather that whole mess be cut from the script and save my bum cheeks from some numbness... But on the other hand, if the runtime wasn't so long, I wouldn't have had that extra scoop of ice cream...I had thought that a nice touch was making the antagonist, Sator, nameless like The Protagonist. I had thought the gold bars and killing someone was in order to steal that identity, but apparently it was because they were sent back from the future. Like the ending of Inception, that's one I'll interpret myself.Christopher Nolan the director did an amazing job. Christopher Nolan the screenwriter needs a few rewrites on this one."
1371,"If not for the concept, this movie would be a 4/10. The audio was terrible and muddy. The characters were all borrowed from other movies. Emotions were nearly nonexistent, including times when at one point a mother says of her son, ""He's everything."" There is scant chemistry between anyone. The idea of this movie is brilliant but the movie itself is tedious and reliant on special effects and concepts to do its work. If you want characters and situations to care about at all, this is not a good movie for you. It's a mindless remake of 17 other films added to one really good idea. As it is, it was mildly entertaining."
1372,"Honestly a great movie, would most definitely recommend watching it in IMAX"
1373,"If you can see what will happen then you will do what has to have been and if that is the case nothing can change. The paradox of meeting yourself eliminates the past as all you witness meaning their is two meaning there is 2 bad guys.... they only removed one!! and the other is in their past...they cant get too! logic fail...
you erase the problem before you deal with the problem...which means you never dealt with the problem, which mean paradox,,,which means logic fail."
1374,"""Find A to get B to find C"" type of plot.
Non-existent character development.
Leaves you scratching your head (which is not a bad thing), but that's all it does (which IS a bad thing)"
1375,"It has been almost 3 hours(as of writing this) since I saw this movie and I still cannot wrap my head around what I saw. The movie is just spectacular in every way imaginable and is 100% worth the long wait. The movie centers around the Protagonist as he makes his way through international espionage armed with only the word Tenet. The action in this movie is some of the best ever shot and I would argue is even better than Inception's. The use of time in this movie is in depth and logical, while also being extremely enjoyable to watch. The performances in this movie are all top notch with John David Washington being simply outstanding. I will admit that the movie does fall into a lot of common Christopher Nolanism, but this is not a bad thing. The cinematography in this movie is just beautiful and expansive. The score is also extremely powerful with it being used extremely well throughout the movie. The movie makes me want to watch more Nolan movies, but maybe after a day or two. The movie is also thrilling throughout its whole 2.5 hour run time. I was on the front of my seat the whole time and when the movie makes reveals about what was happening almost always blew me away. The reveals were all cinematically and pleasing story wise because Nolan gives the viewer just enough to know what is going to happen while also making it difficult to predict. The movie is one of the best this year and a movie I think everyone needs to see immediately. Also I think this movie might be top 3 Nolan for me and I think is better than Inception in a lot of ways."
1376,"I have just exited the cinema, I'm afraid Tenet was not the awe inspiring epic I had been promised.
Firstly the sound mix is appalling, either the distribution has seen a catastrophe, the sound editor is a crackhead or I'm losing my hearing solely in the range of the human voice.
The premise is intriguing with lots of palindromic high-jinks. However the twists are predictable & some of the action tiresome without any real peril.
Branagh is marvellous, sociopathy oozes from every pore. Bravo sir."
1377,"I don't like to rate films but I had to..This review is for Nolan's fans who couldn't put their fingers on what wen wrong with TENET:The beginning is good.. It reminds you of the dark knight.. The opening scene is similar to when the clowns were about to rub the bank in The Dark Knight..I said it before just from watching the trailer.. Now I am saying it after watching the movie.. Nolan made a huge mistake by choosing J.D Washington as the protagonist.. He is just not cut out for it.. His acting is a little bit.. I think the word that comes to mind is shallow!!
He is very monotonous and You can see that his ego interferes with his performance.. And as I always say.. You can never be a great actor if your ego is in the way.. J.D's arrogance is obvious I am afraidIn some scenes the music does not go well.. It feels like an overlap.. Like it doesn't make sense at all..Some dialogues in the script also lack depth and a sense of cohesion.. I say to Nolan it is a Great story but a good script.. sometimes not that good!!
I don't know how Nolan did not notice this while fimling.. J.D Washington is almost reading the lines every time he is in a conversation with another person.. It is like he is not in the zone.. He is not completely the protagonist.. Many times it feels as if he is reading those lines directly from the script.. This is due to lack of emotion and body.. And also lack of natural charisma.. Because you can tell from his presence in the scenes that he is trying to be charismatic.. It doesn't feel natural .. And this is one of the main reasons why the movie feels boring until half of it.. Then it gets a little bit exciting with the action and inversion scenes..As you keep watching you get the feeling that J.D.W is not quite understanding the role, and this resulted in even confusing his partners in all his scenes.. They are performing according to his performance.. Because as it is said: Acting is reacting! Man most of the scenes I can literally see J.D is preparing his next line to say while looking at his partners in the scenes to finish their sentences.. Unfortunately it's that bad..Another thing is the time of dialogues between characters.. They are hurried.. Most of them feel interrupted almost like conversations that never made it through.. In a movie about time.. Conversations had no time HahaTo be honest.. I began to lose focus and interest in the movie after the first 25 minutesIn J.D.W and Robert Pattinson's conversations and scenes suddenly I began to wish as if Robert was the one playing the protagonist.. Yes He was that good in this movie.. But maybe because He had Batman.. And I think in all the scenes.. Robert kind of forced J.D to perform better.. Great guy Robert really a great guy!Elizabeth Debicki also did a good performance.. She also pushed J.D to perform better in her scenes with him.. I remember her from the Great Gatsby.. This role as Kat is better I think.. She developed depth and realness in her acting.. She is calmer and steadier.. And very charismatic and attractive!!The truth of Tenet is.. All the principle characters preformed better than the protagonist.. So is this mean that maybe Christopher Nolan didn't actually find the right actor for the job and he had to go with J.D ? Maybe! Or Maybe not! Or He just missed this time...So the idea which this movie is based upon is the entertainment of the show.. Which is basically inversion.. A world where everything you knew about reality runs backwards from past to future and from future to past and in the now is where the operation of the protagonist is happening.. It is new.. It is exciting.. But it is not flawless eitherAll in all it is a good movie.. It may take Nolan a while to realize that he didn't made the right choice when choosing the leading actor of his film..In fact this movie would have been better than Inception.. way better.. Only if it wasn't J.D.WAnd only one name comes to mind when I think about the best actor for the protagonist .. And it is Jake Gyllenhaal...Am"
1378,"I have watched Tenet twice now where the audio has problems in my first watching only. Now I have seen it the second time I can grasp the film far better, but did not enjoy the movie more per se.What made it hard to understand the first time was the protagonist jumping from location quite often with minimal explanation. The time manipulating element in the film (which I won't spoil, but only criticize) is quite clever in the second act, but extremely hard to grasp in the third. The second watching made it clearer but there is a large action scene there in the 3rd act that is just really hard to follow. My gf and I were sometimes wondering if they were fighting themselves as the baddies look almost identical.
Also some parts of the time manipulation thing seem to be break logic a bit, but because of spoilers that's all I have to say about that.
In terms of character's the protagonist doesn't really have an ark and I didn't really feel the emotional connection he had to other characters. I also found his acting notably bad in some dialogue scenes. Pattinson is pretty good but he doesn't have much to work with.
It is actually very comparable to inception although it does not have as much exposition, and doesn't have leonardo dicaprio we can really connect with. Leonardo longed for his wife and kids. The protagonist in Tenet does not have this connection or acting talent.
For the rest there were some decisions characters made that put the mission at risk which I found weird. The action scenes were sometimes pretty good but nowhere near the heights of Nolan's other films.
The music was although unique very jarring sometimes as it could be so loud that nothing else could be heard. It can take you a bit out of an action scene where the dark knight had a better balance of the music being loud and softer in bits. They've gone a bit too far with it here.
All in all I found movie clever in parts, bit illogical in others. Character development was almost non existent and plot hard to grasp. It is imo the worst of Nolan's films."
1379,"Christopher Nolan never fails to direct a groundbreaking, awesome movie, and Tenet is certainly no exception. The film explores some interesting ideas of flip flopping an objects or persons direction on time, and while reverse footage isn't anything new, it's still an interesting mechanic in the film to watch. The film is very reminiscent of old spy movies, John David Washington's nameless character only known as ""The Protagonist"" cracks lots of one-liners and wears a very contemporary suit. The other actors are good as well in their job of bringing life to the world and carrying it along through the runtime. Kenneth Branagh's villain is very reminiscent of old evil villains such as Goldfinger. The action scenes are entertaining, both backwards and forwards. There are a few confusing bits in the movie I couldn't follow and some characters have muffled speech due to the use of gas masks throughout the film, and some things felt unexplained but it draws me in to see it again. Overall, the film was very inventive and proves that even after 20 years, Christopher Nolan is still reinventing the living daylights out of cinema."
1380,"Definitely more confusing than the other Nolan movies. Still not 100% sure what I watched, and probably won't until one or two more viewings.Despite being super confusing, the movie was still absolutely thrilling.Other reviews are correct when they say that the dialogue was a little garbled, but you can make out most of the words.Gonna watch it at least two more times in theaters.Nolan doesn't miss"
1381,"Christopher Nolan delivers another punch!
A film that again takes up the topic of time anomaly, but this time much more complex and difficult to understand than
back in ""Interstellar"".
Although the film has a long running time (2.5 hours), there is so much going on in parallel, interlaced and quickly told that you definitely have to watch the film several times to understand it entirety.
First the obvious in advance:
The cast is superbly selected. The actors are not yet seen dead and offer a more than convincing performance.
The locations are spectacular, exciting and definitely unique. Like in a James Bond movie, only better.
The soundtrack is written by Ludwig Göransson and is simply epic about the film.
No CGI effects visible, elaborate film scenes, perfectly realized.To the topic:
Simply put, it's about what happens when objects can move backwards through time.
It is not easy to explain but the fact is that anomalies or paradoxes occur.
So if you take a person A, then this person A can cross a so called turnstile in the movie, which reverses the time for him. From the point of view of an observer B, who has not entered the turnstile, this person seems to disappear into nothingness.
Here the anomaly arises: At an earlier point in time there are two people A. One moves forward through the time A+ (up to the turnstile) and the other A- moves backward (from the turnstile), respectively inversely. From the point of view of A+ his second ego A- seems to move backwards. But in this case this is only a question of perspective. Because from the view of A- the whole world, including A+ now moves backwards.This raises several interesting questions which the film takes up:
1. what happens if A+ and A- meet by chance?
2. isn't it then already predetermined that A+ will enter the turnstile, no matter what he decides?
At this point quote from Neil: ""A creed of faith in mechanics"" (principle of causality)
Is the decision only a subjective illusion? Neil: ""That does not excuse doing nothing""
3. can A- kill his former self A+ or change his past?
Hard to imagine, because how else could the older A- exist. ""Grandfather paradox""The film doesn't go into the technology of these turnstiles, which I don't think is important in view of this interesting topic.
Christopher Nolan uses these questions as the hook of his film. Through the fast narrative style and the filming from different time perspectives he makes this an extremely demanding film with extreme depth!"
1382,"Oh the disappointment. Really looking forward to this but what a lot of convuluted drivel. The sudden emergence of timetravel machines, where did they come from?
Everyone excited to get back into the cinema but soldiers running backward alongside soldiers running forward wasn't what I'd hoped to see.
Kenneth Branagh was great as a totally horrific villian and husband but the rest was rubbish, ridiculous script. Very underwhelmed. One only for failed physics students to watch I suspect.
Only because of Covid restrictions did I stay to the end."
1383,The soundtracks without Hans Zimmer is going down. I can't feel the motif. It's extremely loud and incredibly noisy that it drowns the dialogue. I watched it three times at different cinemas and pretty much the same. This is the kind of film that if you miss one piece of information you might struggle to understand the plot later on. Without being able to hear the dialogue clearly certainly doesn't help with that. The music is just too loud and of no direction to me.
1384,Filled with Nolan's unique elements and mind-bendind moments. A mysterious piece of art overall but storytelling elements are a little complicated like Nolan's other works. Maybe a little bit more complicated than the other ones tho.
1385,"Tenet
2020
12A
Director: Christopher Nolan
Starring: John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Kenneth Branagh, Elizabeth Debicki etcOverall rating 97/100
Armed with only one word, Tenet. A protagonist must fight with the help of some friends along the way from stopping the whole worlds past and everyone with it being destroyed, but technology called inversion found from the future poses a threat like nobody has ever seen before. Wow what a masterpiece Tenet on so many levels especially visually and creatively one of the best and most unique movies I have seen, let's discuss this in more detail.First of all, the film's cinematography and set pieces were truly phenomenal. Tenets cinematography was truly one of the best I have ever seen in a movie, it was just like other Nolan movies visually captivating, but somehow he managed to achieve another level of visual creativity, with so many different shots and visual elements that I had never seen before and that genuinely left me amazed with what I was watching, it just made you get lost in this new world. The set pieces for this movie were also fantastic, I loved how big this movie went, there was so many world travelling locations with different cultures and set pieces that it added even more visual creativity and appeal to the movie with the movie also having a variety of different characters from different backgrounds and cultures as well which was great and added a good amount of inclusivity and just made the film feel grander in scale.My next few positives would be the action, score, and clever plot. The films plot was one of the most clever and creative things I have had the pleasure of watching, the thought of reversing time or the ability to change the past has never been done in this way before or with so much thought, was It fairly complicated to follow at times, yes but once you understand it, you can just like me really appreciate the creativity and artistry behind the plot of the movie. The action was also fantastic, due to the creativity of reversing time this added to the entertainment of the action sequences, it was so nice to get unique action instead of the generic constant explosions, the fact that characters were often moving in different directions or seeing the aftermath of an action scene before it even happened was just incredible to watch and left me consistently entertained. The score was also one of my favourite parts of the movie. The movies soundtrack was truly captivating, whenever there was a big action scene or big reveal the score exploded into action and it just made the film so much more entertaining and made the viewing experience so much better and with the sound quality at the cinema there was no better way to see a movie of this scale.My only slight nit-pick that stopped the movie from being perfection for me was the lack of depth to the main character. For me the fact that John David Washington's character never really had a name or that we never really knew anything about him apart from the basic role within the film was a slight issue for me, it would have been nice if the character work had the same consistent amount of attention to detail then the movies creativity with it's plot and visual elements.My next few positives would be the script, performances, humour, and great villain. The script for Tenet was so masterfully crafted it blew my mind. Every single little detail was thought out and linked together perfectly and so cleverly it all just made sense by the end. I also really liked the jumbled way the story was told making it even more enjoyable putting the pieces together as they were further revealed. I also thought the performances here were excellent, from everybody which was nice to see. Kenneth Branagh delivered a surprisingly tense and intimidating performance which I wasn't expecting from him but he played the villain extremely well, you never knew what he was up to, and he knew every move of the characters making him a very threatening villain and genuinely making me question whether he would win or not. Elizabeth Dubecki did a fantastic job, she made the character one of the most connectable and her versatility with her emotions when acting made you empathise with her character well. The two main performances from John David Washington and Robert Pattinson were also brilliant. Both had heaps of charm and charisma when watching and were fantastic leads, with John David Washington especially putting everything into his performance. The film was also quite funny as well, the banter between Pattinson and Washington's character as well as the villain was great, with some great one liners and sarcastic humour that landed well.My final few positives would be the tense tone, plot twists and fantastic final act. The movie managed to execute a surprisingly good tense tone, it was a mixture of all sorts of things, the fantastic villain and not knowing whether the main characters were going to succeed was a big factor, but also the movie kept you on your toes not knowing what was going to happen in each scene, therefore for me leaving me on edge a lot of the time. The plot twists were also fantastic, they were so excellently set up, you never saw them coming until they were shown on screen, which is great as so often big blockbusters go for very predictable plot twists that you can see coming from a mile off, but not in this case, these plot twists genuinely shocked me and pieced a lot of the puzzle together for the movie. And finally Tenets final act has to be one of the most entertaining piece of cinema I have seen. I was never bored, with the combination of what made the movie so fantastic, with going all out with the visuals, action, performance and just pure cleverness, everything pieced together perfectly leaving me very satisfied with the end result with the stakes of the plot being extremely high.Overall Tenet is another masterpiece from Tenet, who has made yet another movie that stands on it's, with it's own uniqueness and creativity. Showing some of the best visuals, action and plot's you will see and definitely deserving of a safe but fun trip back to the cinema."
1386,"Ok its super complicated, i didn't even get the half of it, but there is absolutely no effort to make you connect to the characters, good or bad.It felt like episode 5 of a 12 episode show, nobody is ever really concerned about whats going on and everything somehow just goes on lol no matter what happens yo any of the cast. That doesn't mean the acting is bad its just like they cut all the parts where you get to know the people and care about them and just kept the action.Add that to the super complicated and fast moving script and you'll get a visually amazing mess."
1387,"Nolan's trademark look, feel and intrigue are present so it should appeal to the fans on a superficial level.
It's complicated. But unlike other films that shift the sequence of time to deliberately mind bend the viewer, the complexity comes from what is linear and how inverted time integrates, so just go with it and enjoy how the story unfolds and reveals.
If you have read any review it will tell you the main character, is only known as The Protagonist, which by definition dehumanises but should have depth. There was a line at the beginning of the film that summed it up where Michael Caine says ""You will need better than Brooks Brothers to convince"" and the middle of the road suit was an appropriate metaphor for Mr Washington's performance. It wasn't bad but it wasn't the quality the film deserved and certainly not enough to hold the film together for the duration. Irrespective of the exciting final scene and effects I was not invested in him to care if he saved the world or not.
I'm not usually a fan of Pattinson or Branagh but they delivered and Debicki Shone as she reprised her role from The Night Manager as the wife of the bad guy."
1388,"Interesting in a blockbustery way.
However, it shared the same fault as the Lord of the rings trilogy; the dialogue was often mumbled, not sharp in tone and overwhelmed by an excessively loud and persistent sound track. This would have been alright in say, a Terminator movie, but with good actors that deserved listening to and a complex story line, by the end of 2.5 hours i was relieved when it ended."
1389,"My definition of a good film; , an engaging, intriguing, gripping storyline. A script that can be followed. Good acting, interaction and empathy between characters that the audience can latch on to. Feeling I want a character to succeed in what ever there cause maybe. Visual stunning and a soundtrack that provides the final glue to bring it all together. Making the whole film leaving me entertain.
Tenet fails in many of these vital aspect's. It starts off well, giving the viewer the antipation that a very hyped blockbusting movie is going to fill the next 2 hours. But, it soon becomes apparent that I really don't care what happens to any of the characters. The soundtrack is way too loud and mainly electronic bass generated garage music. The sound in places let's the actors down as words are drowned by the music, especially in scenes when they are wearing head gear, helmets etc. Robert Pattinson, however put in a good performance, and is growing in every film he does. Elizabeth Debciki did what, many can't, make and impact and presence when on screen excellent. Unfortunately, her on screen Russian husband, doesn't quiet work for me. Modelling Marks and Spencer holiday shirt's, while on his superyacht and accent honed from Agatha Christie's many baddies does not make a 200million budget film work..
In summary, I was looking forward to an exciting blockbusting film. What I got was a confluted storyline that was just ridiculous, with action scenes that were like any other Hollywood movie with good special effects.My hope now is that 'Blockbuster' films to follow, Black Widow, Wonder Women 1984 and James Bond will I am sure prove better all round entertainment, soundtracks, stunts and empathy with characters.Which is what I want, from the cinema experience."
1390,"After leaving the theatre, I wouldn't be able to tell you an accurate description of what this film was about. The action and visual affects were superb. But apart from that, I didn't enjoy the boring and bland story which Nolan tried to enrich with this techno's thing that confuses most. Overall the film is a 7/10 but my judgement has been hindered as I was Jeff feeling disappointe."
1391,"This film is objectively cr@p!
There are no words in the English language to accurately describe how bad this movie is!The fact that this film is so highly rated is scary!
Its the canarie in the coal mine.
It says more about the deeper psychological issues facing humanity than anything else.I have no faith in our future!"
1392,"If you did not like interstellar, do not watch.
It was a torture.
Had to leave before the end."
1393,What the hell was this another hype shack that was beyond stupid. I need a drink because this just is another time waster.
1394,"Most people are familiar with the effect of a film clip being played backwards. You see bullets flying back into the barrel, or buildings magically rising from a pile of rubble, or cars driving in reverse at breakneck speed. This gimmick is the central theme 'Tenet' is built upon.
Of course, director Christopher Nolan uses complicated words like 'inversed entropy' to make it all a bit more interesting. The way he plays with time going forward and backwards at the same time, is an original and intriguing storytelling technique. It also gives him the opportunity to show off his abilities as a director. Filming a car chase with cars going forward and backwards simultaneously on the same road is definitely a tour de force.
But the bad news is that Nolan drowns his original concept in a bloated action movie with clichéd characters and a screenplay that's going nowhere. A creepy Russian oligarch threatening to end human existence, a shootout in a crowded opera house, a Boeing 747 crashing into a large building, and of course a damsel in distress - it's all terribly Bond-like. But the difference is that 007 can get away with that sort of thing, because in Bond movies, things are not meant to be taken too seriously. In 'Tenet', on the other hand, everything is dead serious. Not a single moment of comic relief is to be found in the whole movie.
Instead of concentrating on the inversed flow of time, like he did in 'Memento', Nolan has packed this movie with so much ideas, locations, fights, chases, twists and turns that the viewer loses every sense of direction and desperately wonders what he is looking at.
At one point, the Protagonist is climbing the inside of a large offshore wind turbine. But why? We never find out. And what is the point of the female lead? Difficult to believe that she is the Protagonist's love interest, because they hardly spend any screen time together. And what is the purpose of the Michael Caine character, apart from including Michael Caine in the film? The viewer is left with so many inconsistencies and unanswered questions that he almost forgets there are also good parts.
Tenet's budget was 205 million dollars. I think it would have been a much better film if Nolan would have spent half that money, and focused on what he really wants to tell the audience."
1395,"I found this film difficult to 'follow'. Possibly it wasn't intended for you to be able to follow it. It simply wasn't coherent to me. In scenes people and cars would be going one way and others would be going the other way in reverse.And the 'mumbling' from the actors/actresses didn't help. Half the time I couldn't make out what they were saying.After one hour I noticed people starting to leave as they gave up on trying to follow the film. Basically, it got boring as you gave up trying to understand it.The main male actor was quite good except I think the camera work could have been better in not somehow showing him to be about 4 feet something 'tall'. It didn't help that the main female lead towered over him in scenes. Normally who cares - but in this film he was trying to protect her whereas I couldn't help thinking that the roles should have been reversed."
1396,"So I went to see Tenet... wish I hadn't. More than 2 hours wasted of my life.
If you insist on watching the movie, just make sure you disconnect your brain before entering.Story makes no sense, it's filled with paradoxes and contradictions and characters are shallow and unrelatable. If they live or die, you couldn't care less. At no point do you have any sympathy for these people.I must say the action scenes are impressive and forward-backward combat is intense and interesting. Makes no sense, but it's fun to watch. Everything else is disposable.
Below you will understand why this movie is among my bottom 5 movies of the year. Spolier alert.When you are making a time-traveling story, the time line and space-time interactions have to be deeply thought through to make sure you don't find yourself in endless loops or paradoxes. Tenet didn't think anything through. It's filled with mistakes. Some quite obvious, some deeply buried in a nonsense story.
First, we have a group of ""heroes"" from an unknown and un-explained government branch, that know about time travel and are here to prevent the destruction of the universe. I kid you not. Fine, I can go along with that. A kind of cheap and simple way to explain what the characters are fighting for.Then, there's the villain. Super millionaire, with endless resources, hellbent on destroying the universe. Cliché anyone? yet another example of a movie without a lot of thought put into it. Now, this evil mastermind knows that if he succeeds, the whole universe will cease to exist. Why? Is he angry with society? Is he disappointed on humanity? There is no reason for him trying to end all existence.
The story tells you 9 pieces of the doomsday machine had to be gathered to operate, but the movie begins with the bad guy obtaining the last piece. Why are there 9 pieces then? Wouldn't it have been more to fun to see the race between heroes and villains trying to obtain the pieces? Why no just say it is one machine and keep it simple?
And time travelling: heroes can travel into the future and move backwards in time or travel to the past and move forward. But when he is travelling backwards, somethings are moving forward while others ar moving backwards. Not only is it confusing, but it makes no sense. Isn't everything except the hero supposed to move backwards? If a car chase ends in an explosion where he gets blown to pieces, shouldn't he begin as pieces getting pulled back together? Instead he freezes?!
But how are they able to travel in time? Another fantastic solution: someone (no one knows who) in the future made a time traveling machine and, somehow, in the present, they found those machines. Really? That's how you pulled time-machines out of your sleeve?
Ant they tell you there's only a few machines, yet the heroes find them all over the place. Very conveniently. And it's an unknown, futuristic, new technology, yet a group of soldiers are now experts on the subject. How?They tell you that you cannot touch your future or past self or you will disintegrate into oblivion. Yet the hero has a fabulous fight scene... with himself!!! And they never touched? Not even a little bit?They tell you that, no matter what you do, what happened will happen; you can't change the past. So what's the point of the movie? Why are the heroes fighting. If there is a future where someone will build a time machine, clearly the bad guy didn't succeed in his evil plans. Why worry? It's already happened.The final scene is ""great"" (<- notice my irony). That's when you realize budget wasn't sufficient: The story takes you to a deserted factory in the middle of the desert, where the bad guys are trying to detonate the machine. Again, conveniently enough, there is a time machine right there. In the middle of nowhere. So they decide they will have two teams of super soldiers (that is unclear where they came from). One will fight forward while the other will travel to the future and fight backwards. Why? What's the point?
The moment where future and past will meet is exactly the moment of detonation. That would mean that both teams are too late. Right?
But the best part is that these two teams find themselves in this battlefield, filled with gunfire and explosions fighting against... no one. Budget cuts? Was there not enough extras to hire and enemy force? Heroes charge amidst explosions and bullets but you never see the enemies. Not one. What are they shooting at? it's completely abandoned. There isn't a single enemy soldier. What kind o battle is this?In the end, they travel back in timer to the moment where the supervillain is on his boat and will activate the doomsday machine. Although, since they traveled into the past, the machine has not been assembeled yet. So his trigger travels in time too?
But they want to fool the bad guy by using his wife to tramp him. If this villain is the future villain that has assembled the machine, he knows his wife is a traitor and would shoot her on sight. Again, since in he already shot her in the future. But he is seduced by her, so it must the past villain that doesn't know that the wife is a traitor and, therefore, doesn't know that the machine has been assemebeled in the future, and therefore is no threat because he doesn't have the trigger yet. So either case makes NO SENSE. Which one is it?
And if they can travel back in time, why don't they just travel to the time where the supervillain is a kid and shoot him, and be done with?Like I said, this movie SUCKS and it hasn't been thought through at all. Poorly written, poorly acted, and terribly managed. You can never understand who's doing what in what direction. A total disaster."
1397,"You come to expect twists and turns as well as a complex story with Nolan, however this one was over the top and ruined the movie. This was compounded by the fact you couldn't hear any of the dialogue as it was often muffled and the music was too loud.I am sure it will be a better watch second time round but I am not going to bother finding out."
1398,"Compared to Nolans earlier films this one is actually pretty straight forward. The inversion concept is easy to grasp and doesn't affect the pace of the movie which is furious and intense. Direction, acting, scenography, photography and musical score is top notch but first and foremost it's a thrilling and entertaining experience not to be missed!"
1399,Worst film of 2020? Maybe not but this was bad. Zero character development. Confusing story line that doesn't engage with the viewer at all. This film was so bad I would have been happy if the underlying threat of the end of the world actually occurred to put us out of our misery. Why was Michael Caine rolled out? What was the point of the first scene? Who knows? Who cares? Waste of time and money. One for the fans of this director. The rest of us know how bad this was. It was so bad. Bad bad bad.
1400,"Phil's Quick Capsule Review:
Tenet has a lot resting on its shoulders. Cinemas have literally been waiting to reopen for it to release. It's a film that HAS to work. That HAS to get people to the cinema. And in that regards it will... a big director with big ideas, a great cast and LOUD. So loud. But as a film Tenet is a strange one. I felt like I was a passenger not a participant - at times dragged along in a story that never cared if you could followed it or not. The thing with Inception was that it was made so well that you always knew what was happening, when and how. Tenet is not that film. You are lost, the action is confusing, the sound mix making most dialogue inaudible, the story makes no sense and it's often spectacle for spectacle's sake. But all that aside it was the films total a lack of heart & warmth that left me cold, not caring and certainly not in a rush to see it again. But please see this on the big screen as at home I fear it will probably make even less sense...Best Bit: The planeCinema, Stream, Avoid: CinemaIf You Liked this Try: Inception, Memento, The Dark Knight"
1401,........time travel moving always get lost in themselves. This one you can see all the twists coming a mile away
1402,"""Tenet"" is the newest movie by British Oscar-nominated filmmaker Christopher Nolan, who is widely considered among the most defining and visionary film directors these days, also because he writes his own screenplays. He had his 50th birthday this year and as a gift for his fans, there is a new movie out and here we have it. It runs for 2.5 hours exactly pretty much and I must say sadly that this is among my least favorites from the Oscar-nominated director. I wonder if he will ever win one. Probably, but I can't see it happen for this film here. I also struggled a bit with his previous movie ""Dunkirk"" three years ago, but there I thought it was maybe partially because war films were never my favorite genre. But this one here, in the widest sense, has parallens with ""Inception"" and that is a film I really appreciated, more with each viewing, but then again, maybe I need to watch this one also once or twice in the future and maybe I will appreciate it more. I just cannot say I am motivated at all right now. This also has to do with the cast. Or at least with lead actor John David Washington, who is strangely enough not even close to being first credit here on imdb. I also felt that on his big breakthrough film by Spike Lee that almost had him nominated for an Oscar, he was not particularly good, so I still do not really see any lead actor potential in him. This movie here definitely did not change my mind. Then again, Nolan's films are almost always more about the magic of the story and the scientific aspect partially even, the other production values too, and not necessarily about really deep and meaningful characters. It is the case here again. Robert Pattinson is another good example. I definitely think he received a lot of unfair criticism for Twilight and he has been (unlike Lautner) in several good films in the last decade since these vampire films and given strong performances too. He is definitely an option for an Oscar nomination in the near future. But for this film here he felt almost completely wasted. I mean he had a lot of screen time, but barely any significance. The one who stood out a bit in terms of performances here was Kenneth Branagh showing us that he can play a Russian brute very well too. Talented actor and filmmaker without a doubt and his rough take on the role made his relationship with Debicki's character the most interesting component of the entire film perhaps. Debicki did what she had to do I would say, but she never really stood out either. Oh yes, Nolan regular Michael Caine, who is closing in on 90, gets his one scene as well again basically talking to the protagonist relatively early on just like it was the case with ""Inception"" too for him. No material to shine at all though. That's pretty much it with the cast. More familiar faces and names too for sure, but nobody really outstanding.As for the story, you are thrown right in the middle of it all with the concert hall scene. It is tense and brutal, but for me it was too fast and I would have preferred a little more introduction and explanation here. Let's be honest. If you did not know who the protagonist was, simply because JDW is kinda famous (like him or not), it would have felt even more pointless. The idea of the suicide pill being just a test is an interesting one though and also kinda makes sense that it was all staged because, let's be honest, the ""bad guys"" must be utter fools to let such a severely suffering prisoner give his pill to another one caught by them. Still, this was to me the first moment and inclusion that felt good. A lot of the story about travelling back in time, like literally physically back in time felt not depicted in a way where it convinced me. If we are gentle, we could say that Nolan's mind is still too great to make sense to general audiences, but if not, we could also say that his idea here was not good and interesting enough and more for the sake of being genius than actually being genius and that also a lot got lost in translation. I did like the really simple introduction scene to the concept though at the shooting range between the scientist and the protagonist. This was nice. But when they extended this concept to humans and a plot that is about saving the world, then it did not win me over unfortunately. Oh well, like I said, maybe I need to watch it again. Also the final moment between Washington's and Pattinson's characters where we find out they knew each other for a lot longer did not make much of an impact to me. At least not as much as I hoped because this beautiful friendship was supposed to be shown as one of the more emotional twists this film has to offer. I would say that judging from the absense of audible reactions from the crowd during my showing that most others were not really that impressed either. Or maybe I am being too harsh here and really need to rewatch to see if the one reviewer on the front page here is correct by saying that it feels like nothing special on the first viewing, but pretty great on rewatch. Still not motivated though and besides, I rarely tend to appreciate a movie more on television or a small screen than at a movie theater and I will definitely not go again as long as it is shown right now. The only reason that could kinda get me to would be Branagh's performance. Here Nolan proves again for me that he may not really be the best when it comes to truly emotional aspects away from action sequences. I am mostly talking about the talk referring to the female protagonist's son. Like when we hear from one character the world will be destroyed and then Debicki's character says something like that would mean her son dies too. A bit on the cringe side. I am kinda glad they did not elaborate more on a potential romance relationship between her and JDW's character because then things could have gotten really messy. The one scene with the talk about Branagh's antagonist character thinking they could have sex was enough already. Speaking of him, he also talks on one occasion about holes in the neck and what to fill them with. Okay, that was rough. And almost a bit of cult like from a Tarantino movie (where we indirectly could have seen it depicted on the screen even). I won't deny it. Rough, but entertaining. What you think about the terminal disease plot that got revealed later on and as a consequence about Branagh's character developing some kind of god complex is up to you. I thought it was right, but like I said, I believed almost everything about Branagh's character and performance here. It's okay if you think it was too much. The one thing I would not be okay with though is really people saying that this was a magnificent movie or (one of) Nolan's best. I thought it was too much on the underwhelming side for a positive recommendation even and I genuinely hope that the filmmaker can improve again with his upcoming projects. I mean he may have another 30 years in the industry and I refuse to believe that ""Tenet"" (spelled Tenet backwards too, definitely not a coincidence) and ""Dunkirk"" will be on the same level as everything he has coming up in the future or at least I don't want to believe. No need to challenge your audience this much, Chris, sometimes less is more. How about an animated movie for once?"
1403,"In my opinion this is the worst of all of the bad Christopher Nolan story ideas all rolled into one big turd. Don't get me wrong, I like the first two Batman movies, Dunkirk, Momento and really like the Prestige. It's just the other 2 Christopher Nolan movies that I've seen that I just cannot stand. (Inception and Interstellar)The universe in Tenet is so divorced from reality that at a certain point it's easy to get bored and not care about the characters or the world that they're trying to save. And even if one does care, it doesn't make any sense anyway. I read the plot synopsis after it ended to be sure that I didn't miss some important story development that explained all of what appeared to be nonsense to me. Nope. I missed nothing. The synopsis described pretty much everything as I saw it. And it made no sense.And I've yet to read a review from someone who could explain what about this movie's story was good, bedsides it being original. And original can only do so much if what makes it original also makes it MAKE NO SENSE!!!Tenet legitimately makes much less sense than interstellar or inception. And I think both of them are annoying at times. But the skeleton is at least some recognizable resemblance of reality. Tenet never offers a very clear sense that it works within a regular world. No news story ever talks about people experiencing people doing things backwards. And how crazy it all is. There is none of that.And it's sad because this production wasted a lot of cool visual special effects, and some talented actors.Also, the sound mixing is AWFUL!!! Half of the time the music is too loud and obnoxious to hear the dialogue. Probably to cloak the audience realizing that none of anyone was saying could possibly make any sense.I wonder if the Nolan cult fans have a left side of their brain. Because it seems that all the story sophistry that makes his bad movies bad is what makes his bad movies good to his cult of supporters.If you're tempted to see this because I roasted it so much, please remember what I said about it being boring. It's really boring. Not just bad. Don't waste you time or money.It tries to be way too clever. But just comes-off stupid, inconsistent, and nonsensical to anyone with the slightest skepticism. It lures you into hoping that it will all make sense in the end. But if anything, the end offers even more questions than answers. Just stay away."
1404,"I think only he completely understands it. Its just unnecessarily and selfservingly complex. On top of that, the basic plot itself isnt very interesting. Actually its kinda dumb and I dont really feel for the motivation of the main baddy. You know there are movies that are complex and need time to settle in your mind but because they are coherent and logical, after you watch them once or twice, you start getting them.
This however isnt that. Nolan tried to make the movie better by making it more complex. Its too many unncessary ""twists"" and levels, the story isnt that appealing , the main actors not either and there are various stupid gems that make you go hmm? (like the ""time bullet"" that is extra dangerous .... ?? compared to regular bullet which is a gummy bear?).Too try hard and confusing /10"
1405,"That was not choreographed well. It was loud, made no sense. The female lead was really pretty but her neck is too long"
1406,"Tenet, the latest outing by director Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight, Inception, Interstellar) presents an interesting and ambitious idea, that has been done amazingly well and attempted horrendously even more times: the concept of time travel. Tenet falls somewhere in the middle between these two maxims. The distinguishing element in Tenet as compared to other time travel movies is the world building: when characters go back in time, they have to abide by certain rules, such as that certain elements work in reverse (when hit by a flame, you get cold instead of hot, for example). It also seems objects can go back in time, meaning you can shoot someone, by having shot somewhere earlier, and the bullet then flying back in time. I say seems, because the concept is never very well explained. Early on one of the scientists who attempts to explain the mechanics says so early on ""don't try to understand it, feel it."" That message is apparently supposed to be taken literally, as you will often be left wondering what the hell is going on.I will make a note here, however, that there is a chance the film does a glorious job explaining the mechanics. However, the sound mixing was horrendous. Ludwig Gorannsson (Black Panther) delivers the score, which aggressively pulses through the film at nearly all times. Nolan continues his trend of accompanying every scene with music: both a casual sitdown at a restaurant, as well as the action scenes. This works very well for the action scenes, but not for the dialogues, as the score drowns out the dialogue, making it increasingly frustrating to figure out what is going on. Sometimes the background noises in an environment add to the plight of trying to understand the dialogue; there is an unbelievably frustrating scene on a boat where due to the waves not a lick of dialogue can be understood. It is an odd choice in a film which requires the viewer to pay attention to try and figure out what is happening due to the novel time travel technology. Nolan also employs lots of crosscuts between scenes where mechanics are explained, plots are hatched, and put in motion, all in one crosscut. So, within 60 seconds, you switch between constant cuts of two characters discussing an important element of how the time travel works, the same two characters in a different location devising a plan to use this element, and then another scene intermixed where the preliminary work of said plan is put into motion. Combine this with the pulsating synths, and the viewer will have a wonderful time trying to keep track of what is going on.This issue is exacerbated due to the fact that not much time is given to actually process anything, because when the action kicks off, it all occurs at a breakneck speed. Nolan still hasn't figured out how to shoot action scenes, managing to film the action in confusing angles and make puzzling cuts that make the action even harder to follow. Due to the time element, where multiple timelines at times align, the action becomes even harder to follow, which is a shame, as some of the setpieces are amazing in scale and action. The time travel causes magnificent action to unfold, with timelines colliding, certain characters appearing both as their future and present selves, future selves going backwards, while present selves are moving forward, which all leads action scenes that have not been experienced before. Sadly enough, you're still trying to figure out what was done, well after an action scene is completed. You're seeing magnificent action appear in front of you, but you just don't know what or why it is happening.It also feels the time mechanics were underused. Early on you see a a bullet hole from a bullet that had not been fired yet, and I was expecting tons of ingenious scenes playing with this idea and trying to push it to its limits. People managing to jump into planes (by somehow going back in time from when they jumped out of it earlier), characters littering a room with bullets, waiting for the impending arrival of the antagonists and then unleashing all the bullets back into the gun hitting the enemies, etc. Instead, this comes back very sparingly in the first half. This gets amped up a lot more in the second half, but, as mentioned before, you still don't truly understand what is going on, making the action feel somewhat dull despite how much of a technical feat it all is. In a sense, Tenet could have done away with the attempt at trying to appear as an intellectual movie and have just given the characters superpowers, instead of trying to come up with contrived rules on how the timetravel mechanics work, as you won't be able to understand the rules anyway.There is a core issue at the heart of Tenet, however, and that is that it doesn't touch you emotionally: you don't understand the characters, and you don't feel anything for them. In Nolan's previous efforts, of which Inception is probably the best example, as it seems like Tenets spiritual predecessor, you care about the characters. Cobb and Mall had their tragic love story where they went too far with their powers and lost everything they held dear. Cobb's constant fear of getting lost in the dreamworld, or, perhaps, his desire to be there, warring against each other. His constant mission to be reunited with his children versus him missing his wife. Behind every action scene, there were high, personal stakes. This is the issue with most action movies: you don't care about the destruction of a skyscraper or the explosion of a planet, if there is no emotional connection to any of these events.Tenet shares this problem as the characters all seem emotionally detached from the film's plot which centers around stopping an evil mastermind of destroying the world. The Protagonist (this is the character's name, he is never given an actual name) ironically is just that, an empty shell, an infallible character, with no emotional connection to the plot. Then we have Neil, a mysterious agent, so mysterious that you know nothing about him until the very end and so anything he does carries no emotional weight. Kat, is the only one with personal stakes as she is married to the evil mastermind and he is holding her hostage, but she seems more like a constant damsel in distress that just needs saving and actually seems to have nothing to do with the main plotline. As her struggles don't seem to connect with the actual plot of the film, the plot has no emotional weight to it. Even if it did, however, it still wouldn't help, as the film almost solely focuses on the Protagonist and his mission to save the world. Perhaps the film would have worked better if she was more part of the core of the film and got more agency, lending higher personal stakes to the overall plotline, but instead we follow the Protagonist and Neil completing action scene after action scene in an attempt to save the world from an evil mastermind whose rationale you don't understand, by using time travel mechanics that you don't understand, and saving Kat for a reason you don't understand.All in all, it's a daring attempt at a idea that has been done many times before, but not yet done in a manner so ambitious. However, the dumbfounding decision to play music over all expository dialogue, failing to make the viewer feel emotional connection to the characters, and subpar cinematography and editing makes this more of waste of potential than anything else."
1407,"This is peak Nolan. He got a total freedom to express his ideas and to show off. A grandiose cinematic achievement unlikely to be matched anytime soon. It took balls to pull this off and not get lost in the process. Kudos to the editor and the cinematographer as well. Nobody would dare to try this in the past and probably won't in the future. It's bold and unique. Multiple views required to fully grasp the concept. However I don't expect the general public to love it as much as Inception or Interstellar because in those cases he leads the audience and explains quite a lot. Tenet's script relies upon the intelligence of the audience and Nolan doesn't help you along the way. It's a must watch, ideally in IMAX if possible. A movie in which you can see his love for cinema in almost every scene. The pace is fast and 150 mins fly. Music and sound in general is amazing.Tenet will stick with you long after you have left the theatre. You will have a myriad of questions unaswered and to some of them you will find answers after multiple viewings.
Movies like Tenet come seldom to never. A masterpiece in its own category. Tenet sits proudly alongside Inception as a mind-bending spectacle that everyone with love for cinema should see. One could even say Nolan out-Nolaned himself on this one."
1408,"Also, movies should not have to be watched twice to ""get it"".The first action or sci fi type movie in my 40 years that I ever wanted to walk out of the cinema during.The visuals are good at times (although most are just playing normal action scenes in reverse - not exactly ground breaking) but I REALLY enjoyed the music that accompanied the scenes - unique and super effective.My head hurt and I felt physically drained leaving the cinema. So disappointed."
1409,"Two and a half hours that I will never recover. It is good to know that Nolan keeps the Stuntman Guild going, as his action scenes show a man to whom CGI is a last resort rather than a first. But what does it all mean ????
Before he joins the pantheon of legendary action film directors of Ford and Hawks and their modern-day heir-apparents - McTiernan, Hill, Mendes, McQuarrie, Miller and Wheatley - he is going to have to give up his function as a writer to someone who can write a comprehensible story with succinct dialogue and also hire a sound engineer to whom the word ""clarity"" actually has meaning.
Whatever you do, don't give this film a second viewing in the hope of gaining a better understanding of it. It will just inflate the box office figures and give Nolan a reputation as a ""big"" filmmaker that he simply does not deserve. The biggest conundrum about him is that Hollywood still throws big money at him to make films.
After the first half hour I gave up trying to make sense of the plot - a better example of ""gobbledygook"" in modern cinema I've yet to find. Tell a lie, ""Inception"" runs it a close second. There are spies, a threat of global destruction, a damsel in distress, that tired cliché of a Russian oligarch villain, some action sequences where you can see the join between ""heart-stopping"" location shooting and ""green screen"" safety and a finale where something needs to be switched off before the clock reaches ""0:00"" and lots of body-armoured extras shooting at one another, where you can't tell the good guys from the bad.
And it's loud !!! Not something down to the cinema's sound system as I was assured by my local's management. There is a genuine thrilling sequence in the middle of the film that involves BIG trucks that is on a par with the stunt work in ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" but your mind has been thoroughly boggled by that time and afterwards the wait for the end is interminable.
Let's hope that Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli resist any temptation to hire him to make a ""Bond"". If ""Tenet"" was a calling card, I'm sure they would rip it up !!"
1410,"Many loved Nolan's past movies, and expectations were high. So high that many feel the obligation to like this movie too. But this movie is simply not good.First of all the audio problem. You can't figure out what people are saying most of the times, and that ruins the movie. I've read that someone thinks that this was stylistic reason - these people are delusional.No chemistry between characters. You can even remove a few characters from the whole plot, and the end results is the same. You will understand what I mean when you will watch the movie (because you will).The plot is very weak. What happens and why? I promise you nobody in the cinema had any idea. And I don't think that is normal.Locations. The characters are forced to move from continent to continent, but why exactly? Most of the times you will have no idea, not only what is happening, but where is happening. Granted, the movie is beautiful visually, and that's maybe why we see so many locations. But that doesn't make a good movie, it makes a good holiday.Cutting it short, should you watch this movie? Yeah, but don't expect a good movie, and absolutely watch it at home with subtitles."
1411,"At the beginning, you are hooked, and you stay with the story. From the beginning of the film, you are drawn to the smallest idea of why bullets can move backwards. This movie takes that concept of time and explores all possibilities.The acting was great. John David Washington had his father's swagger and Robert Pattinson had you captivated every time he was on the screen. Definitely loved Kenneth Branaugh's antagonist role in the film, he scares you.Most people don't really understand what they just watched after seeing the film. You have to use a big boy/girl brain to understand this. I've seen this 3 times since being out and I'm about to see it again tomorrow.Some of Chris Nolan's most Ambitious work!"
1412,"Explosion, sci-fi, good actors ( denzel was like a robot and not as person, mid actor) and very very good plot"
1413,"Brilliant set plays, stunts on an epic scale from the normally brilliant Nolan. BUT the screenplay, dialogue and sound quality was truly appalling reducing this to little more than a big action/stunt movie ala Fast and Furious.
The dialogue could have been written 13 year old. Desperately disappointing."
1414,"I throughly enjoyed this movie. I can agree with most people that it's not as good as Interstellar or Inception, but in my eyes those are VERY hard to beat. That being said, this movie is close for me. I would like to say, I'm 17, and all of the people who are in their 30s and can't follow a plot to save their lives saying ""it's too confusing"" is ridiculous. Is this Nolan's most confusing film? For sure. But it's still not impossible to understand. Imagine you're watching two side by side videos of you walking across a field. One is played regularly and one is played in reverse. That is essentially the foundation of every scene in this movie, and they legit use this as an example at the very beginning of the movie. I can agree, the sound design is a little rocky, due to the fact it can be hard to hear dialog, but it's the same as Dunkirk. Watch the action and you'll figure out what's going on. The problem is people don't enjoy paying attention for the 2 and a half hour runtime. So, if you don't like movies that make you think and guess, don't go see this. If you love a Nolan film that makes you think, you'll love this one."
1415,I'm a big Nolan fan but was let down by this. The score and sound effects are way too loud. I couldn't t hear what the characters were saying. No character build up. Cut scenes. Awful story.
1416,"This movie is one of the best forms of media I've seen this year and probably many years later. All of the bad reviews just come from the people who either don't understand or can't keep up with the pacing of the film which understandable because the movie requires you to constantly find answers. Overall, if you want to turn your brain off and watch a movie then this is not for you."
1417,"I loved Inception and was really looking forward to this film. I'm sorry to report that it's ultimately a painful experience like sitting through a 3 hour abstract mathematics lecture. A loud monotonous bass soundtrack pounds away while you try to figure out yet another time cross over. It lacked emotion and entertainment just like a class too. They say you need to see it a few times to follow it but it isn't enjoyable enough for one viewing. No, my tenet is I should wait and read an online essay which will explain it and be more entertaining. Wish I could invert my movie ticket."
1418,"Could have been brilliant, unfortunately it is unnecessarily complicated and gimmicky. Very disappointing from such a stellar director with an otherwise impeccable track record. Some good 'character' acting but Washington is out of his depth in the lead role. We know why he was cast, but he is not up to the job. Sad to see casting dictated by societal 'needs' rather than genuine talent."
1419,"As expected, after watching first time, i asked myself, crap, isn't? But when i saw it second time i realized that this is a masterpiece. A must watch"
1420,"If a mainstream film tries to explain enthalpy and anthropia, we are faced with a loaf scenario."
1421,"I was in cinema with friends and we hoped for a epic, but it was not. The main actor and the story lacks all the stuff, what Inception maked great. So 2,5h long and only for fans."
1422,"Humm.
This is not worth of a review more than a warning."
1423,"I had high hopes , but they were soon disappointed. Luckily I watched the movie in german thus I cannot comment on the overwhelming sound effects. I was able to follow all conversations. Yet I still didnt manage to understand what was going on. I have no idea what it was all about. Seriously, I never experienced something like this before. While watching the movie I kept on wondering what is going on. It was sooo hard to keep up. It was all just chaos, bullets, time lapses back and forth and so on ad nauseam. It was exhausting to follow and I eventually gave up. As the movie progressed I was just hoping for this to end as I got more and more annoyed by the mere chaos. Maybe I am just too dumb for this but I did not enjoy this movie and wouldn't recommend wasting your time with this. I really loved inception and if you expect something like this you'll be utterly disappointed."
1424,"I am a cinema projectionist and recently showed ""Tenet"". Never have I had to turn the sound system's volume down from a norm of 5.7 to 3.0, in a (vain) attempt to understand what the characters are saying, half the time muffled through facemasks of some sort or other. The story is clever and far from simple, I assume. And if its exposition could have been laid out in a fashion we could hear and understand, all would have been well. But, alas, it is not.
Mr. Nolan seems to have a fetish for a loud 'thrumming' in the soundtrack's background, which overpowers everything on the screen. This is possibly with a view to increase tension in the viewer. It almost worked, I got a tension headache from being assailed by it. There's plenty of action and car crashes etc. which would have been good if it were known why they were all happening. A second viewing might explain things better, but somehow I doubt it. Even the quiet plot device explanations were unintelligible. The sound mix was always 'tinny' and hollow and often far, far too loud. Many others here have suggested subtitles. I join them in that."
1425,"Oh dear. A great film if you like long scenes full of gobbledegook exposition to try to justify the sheer stupidity of the plot. Michael Caine looked embarrassed at having to deliver such awful dialogue (surely this ranks down there with Jaws 5 as one of his worst ever films).
Even the action set pieces were disappointing or just plain silly (bungee jumping up a skyscraper - really?).
The plot relied far too heavily on characters who had just met revealing secrets to one another.
Utterly ridiculous and nonsensical garbage. Surely I can't be the only one who wants to point out that Emperor Nolan has no clothes on?"
1426,Extremely confusing story compounded by terrible sound. The sound editing is the worst I have ever experienced. It's like the microphones were too far away from the actors when they filmed this movie. The dialogue is so inaudible at times that you need subtitles.Gave a 5 only because of the action sequences.
1427,This film was difficult to watch but it was breathtaking and I couldn't look away.The one issue I had was the score which was so loud I had trouble hearing the dialogue. I assumed it was a problem with my theatre but it seems to be an issue everyone is experiencing. Why on earth would they intentionally do this?The acting was supreme. I never thought I would enjoy a Robert Pattinson character but he was incredible.
1428,Wow what a thought provoking film this is. I feel as though you need to have a good grasp of the laws of time travel & telling you all about it out of sync to fully understand and appreciate this film. Christopher Nolan took the complexity of Inception & pushed the idea to the next evolving/ inverting level for this film.There are great performances from all the cast. You will have to watch it more than once to fully appreciate it.
1429,"Let me preface this by saying that I created an IMDB account just to rate this, because I was just that blown away. Let me also say that I am a huge Nolan fan. At first watch, I was thrilled and blown away by how relentless the pacing and how epic music was (props to Ludwig Goransson, seriously an iconic score). Despite not being able to grasp the barrage of elements and concepts the movie threw our way and the fact that my theatre muddled the sound mixing, I left the theatre in awe of how the movie made me FEEL. The only movie that I feel comes close to being able to draw me in so magnetically for its whole length was 1917.Now upon my second watch in an IMAX with far better sound where I could actually hear dialogue and countless reddit dives, so much of the movie makes sense and flows so much better. I noticed countless little things I did not before that made the movie far more poignant and elevated, and even TENET's concept as a whole felt far easier to understand. From what I hear from my friends, TENET is definitely not a movie for everyone in that it requires the audience's full attention to detail, investment and intellect. This is definitely not your average popcorn movie where everything is spoonfed, and in fact nothing Nolan does is average. This film REQUIRES second viewing and even more to truly appreciate how single detail comes together, and anyone who takes this film at first glance only will sorely miss the nuance and levels it takes on.If you're seeing the movie for the first time and feel overwhelmed but are invested to know more, feel free to dive into Tenet's reddit thread which has given me countless details and theories I missed that made my second viewing so much richer and more informed. TENET is truly a film that only gets better and unveils hidden treasures with each viewing, and I am definitely looking forward to seeing the film again and again in the coming months."
1430,"TENET has finally been released in theatres: and it's a blockbuster's blockbuster, a film that's a big, loud and sweeping espionage movie done in the style of Sam Mendes' James Bond films with a time-bending twist added to the spectacle.It's just what the world of cinema needs right now: a bombastic sci-fi thriller that takes the viewer around the world via The Protagonist' (still reckon it was silly for them to literally classify the main character as that).If you love Christopher Nolan, this one's sure to make you smile and leave you satisfied. 4/5 stars."
1431,"There's so much to appreciate here. That opening scene was incredible, probably my favourite scene in the movie. Pretty much all of the action scenes were great. The score was fantastic, although a little overbearing at times. I didn't think the mixing was a bad as people were saying, apart from the last 30 minutes or so where I couldn't make out what anyone was saying. The cinematography was good. Nothing too great, but good nonetheless.I appreciate the complexity, but it's too much for it's own good. I just can't wrap my head around the concept. Most of the dialogue was just the characters trying to explain things to the audience, but it just doesn't help in my opinion.Didn't think there were any glaring flaws anywhere, so I'd give it at the very least a 6 or a 7, but I'm just going to leave it for now and hopefully rewatch it soon."
1432,"I have seen this film twice now - once on an IMAX and once on a smaller screen to try and get the most from it - and I have to admit it's just nothing special. John David Washington - manscaped to within an inch of his life - is the ""Protagonist"" - a man who can manipulate time and who is recruited to work with ""Neil"" (Robert Pattinson) to track down a device that could destroy the world. His task is made much the harder because the future seems to be the source of much of the danger as he tries to track down and thwart Russian oligarch ""Andrei Sator"" (Sir Kenneth Branagh). Aside from plenty of action and some really clever special effects, that's about the height of it. JDW is adequate in the lead, but Pattinson is about as convincing as a rubber spider and Sir Kenneth's accent is so thick as to remind me of Cate Blanchett's dodgy wubble-ewes from ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" (2008). The star, for me at any rate, is Elizabeth Debicki as the trophy-wife who has an agenda of her own to escape the clutches of her megalomaniac husband, with her son - and so becomes an obvious ally on their quest. The plot is oddly straightforward, it's pretty obvious from the outset whom he can/cannot trust and once the faux-complexities of the story have been laid bare, the rest of the film is just a pretty routine spy drama that looks great - car chases, glamorous scenery etc - but is surely just a superb acclamation of hype over content. Certainly worth watching - and I'd say more than once, but it is by no means the best work from this visionary director ."
1433,"I'm not going to say much about tenet. I love a number of Nolan's films, chiefly the prestige, the Batman films, memento and inception. However, this one... I didn't love it. I respected it and to a large extent I think it's a very well made film, but for Christ's sake, I should be able to enjoy it 1st time. I'm sure I will grow to like it more, but based on 1st viewing, it's a 6 for me. That's all down to the spectacle. The story was complicated and not helped my the sound mix. Made me long for a straight forward Nolan film. Perhaps I will live long enough to see one more, perhaps not."
1434,"The 4 stars are for the action scenes and the acting, which were good. John David Washington is a shining star and I could watch him all day, every day. But not in this movie. As the initial excitement wears off, the irritation slowly builds; the music in some scenes is totally misplaced and distracting, the sound is way too loud in general, and the overcomplicated (or badly told) story causes you to be more confused than connected to the whole enterprise. There is too much going on. A long time before the end your ears and mind are so tired, you won't even care anymore and you'll contemplate leaving the theater. (It's a bet)."
1435,"Dear Nolan,Please stop making movies that you cannot hear what is being said.Stop with the tremendous soundeffects without meaning.Stop doing movies confusing timeline .You need to unterstand the viewer needs to get what is happening in order to misdirect him not just confuse him with Optical Radio NoiseYou need to learn that modern warfare its not about people marching close to each other shooting someone 10 meters away."
1436,"Just like Christopher Nolan's previous time-related masterpeices, Tenet made me think about time and life in a different perspective. Trying to understand the entire film in one watch is almost impossible, but the challenge is part of what makes it an enjoyable experience."
1437,"I've read a few reviews and a couple of things jump out. The first is something I suspect, watch it a couple of times and you will enjoy it more, so I will. The second is something one of the guys I chat to a lot at the cinema said, did I find the sound okay because they thought it was off, which appears in a few reviews, personally I found it fine.I turned to my friend I watch a lot of films with and after 15 minutes said the biggest flaw with this film is I don't care. I found it hard to invest in the dry boring characters. The lead and his side kick were two people I didn't find engaging at all.Obviously it looked great and flowed amazingly well. But the plot wasn't clever and certainly not as clever as it thought it was. It was riddled with predictable elements, such as the scene where he ends up fighting himself.
The oligarch's reason to do what he was doing was flimsy to say the least.Was it really time travel? I thought it was a time loop? But like I said I was losing interest fast and stopped following it as I slipped in and out of it.I'll file this away with inception in 'It insists upon itself'."
1438,"This is a quick non-spoiler review for people ready to see this film. This was a pretty good movie! If your gonna see this, you have to keep watching it. The beginning is nonsense but the end ties the movie together. Great movie. Christopher Nolan did a damn good job."
1439,Overall a great film. I appreciate complexity in events as it requires you to hold focus throughout. Perhaps a typical Nolan film attribute. Complex at times as to be usual when time is reversed/inverted or tampered with lets say. The soundtrack was mind blowing and crucial to the intensity and desperation portrayed in Tenet. I would love to watch it again. Hats off. John David Washington is brilliant.
1440,"Mind bending, action packed thriller. Those who give this a low score need to understand that this film is meant to be watched for the sheer experience of it, and then rewatched to truly understand it! This is what makes it truly incredible and jaw dropping."
1441,"Some people are saying its is confusing, and it is a waste of money. It can be confusing, I didn't find it so, but people I watched it with did. But is it a waste of money? No.
There was little CGI and no green screens used - As with Christopher Nolan's trademark. Therefore the cast had to learn how to act ""backwards"" in the inversion scenes.
Not understanding the plot does hinder the ability to enjoy, but should not completely waste it. Even if you can't understand the story line. Anyone can still enjoy the fantastic cinematic shots.
Needless to say, it was absolutely fantastic!"
1442,"As someone who was disappointed with Inception, this was exactly the Nolan film I wanted to see. Take that as you will."
1443,"Inception is in my top 5 movies of all time, as is Dark Knight and Interstellar. I think Tenet may just about slip into the top 10 with a no doubt higher spot on my list after a few more views. Not because I'm a Chris Nolan fan boy (because Dunkirk doesnt do it for me at all) but I love the sense of impending doom in these movies that Nolan is so good at, and Tenet nails it. You're watching a straight forward (but very good) crime, heist style thriller for 50 mins to an hour, and when the penny finally drops, along with your pop corn and the rest of the audiences jaws, the movie slips into a gear that can only be described as.......well I cant describe it!! I've never seen anything like it. Absolutley mind blowing concept, epic visuals, phenomenal soundtrack, sensational set pieces, and award worthy performances (even Pattison, roll on The Batman). Like Inception before it I'm pretty sure there'll be stories within stories and twists and turns that I'm unaware of yet, hense my 2nd viewing being already booked for the coming weekend. Brain fodder for the thinking persons cinema goer."
1444,"There's so much to digest with this movie. Time moving forwards and backwards at the same time is mind blowing. The plot is chaotic, admittedly I only had a vague notion of what was going on throughout the film. The time changes are beautifully synchronized and flow seamlessly. The cinematography is beautiful. Acting was great from the whole cast."
1445,"A world of corperate espionage, where you sometimes don't know who the bad guys are. Its a world that is interesting and imersive. John David Washington is in the lead role and is very effective and so is Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debecki is also great. The action scenes are well thought it and very impressive and thrilling. The score and sound in this film are worthy of an Oscar. I really loved the way Nolan directed this film. His vision for films of this nature is really visionary. I loved the screenplay there were so clever lines. I really liked this movie."
1446,"I´m neither thrilled nor let down by this film, but for some reason the film felt odd to me. I swear, scenes jumped between so many locations that I could hardly keep up, or be unable to avoid being thrown off by how unnatural/rushed it cut between them. However, that may have been done on purpose as I have a theory on why they chose to do that, but I would have to watch it again to verify that (Honestly I may be thinking too hard at this point).The two things I loved about this film were the music and Robert Pattinson. The concept was also fine, and luckily for me I caught on for the most part, but somehow I left slightly dissatisfied/disappointed. Personally, I wasn´t too invested in David Washington´s ""protagonist"" or Debicki´s damsel in distress, which hurt the film a bit for me. But I gotta respect Nolan for his take on temporal inversion and his re-imagination brought on screen. The amount of work that had to be put into the film to pull this off is beyond me, but judging Tenet as a film, I found it lacking in enjoyment.I´ll give it another watch in a few months time, but for those of you who are on the edge on deciding to go see Tenet I say this; may as well"
1447,"Tenet is a great film - fast paced, thoughtful and original. Cinematography is amazing (see it in IMAX), soundtrack is great (though not by Hans Zimmer). It's just that my geeky nature can't get over those Second Law of Thermodynamics shenanigans. You can't mess with entropy. Entropy messes with you."
1448,"What an amazing film with a very complicated story line but it is worth the watch
and with great actors"
1449,"I think this Is so good.
Really good story and screenplay"
1450,"Ohhh boy... love all of Nolan's films and do really like / kinda love this one, but it is a chore to sit through. The soundtrack is amazing but the audio mixing is a complete mess. Much of what is being spoken cannot be heard -- muffled, music too loud over it, mushy accents, etc. For a movie that needs things explained to comprehend what the heck is going on you would think it would be made important to allow that clarity to get through to the audience. Hey, I get the converging timelines concept and what was happening, but sitting at the back of the theater was difficult. You know when you add too many colors of paint to a canvas and mix them together it all tends to come out muddy and brown... that's what this movie felt like. Muddy."
1451,Just play any video and use the replay buttonBetter then watching this movie
1452,"Tenet is a mind blowing spectacle and definitely Christopher Nolan's most complex film to date that's thrilling, engaging and smart despite limited character depth and emotional stakes. John David Washington gives an incredible and charismatic lead performance and has fantastic chemistry with Robert Pattinson, who is also incredible. Elizabeth Debicki and Aaron Taylor Johnson are incredible as well and Kenneth Branagh is a terrifying villiain. The action sequences are phenomenal and the amount of stuff that is in camera is astonishing. Christopher Nolan's direction is superb and with Hoyte Van Hoytema as director of photography results in a reliably visually stunning film. The music by Ludwig Göransson is excellent."
1453,"After months without going to the theaters, what a treat!Tenet is the best of what cinema has to give, with dazzling action scenes and the kind of mind-bending concept that only Nolan is crazy enough to deliver.
Set in the cold, confusing world of high-stakes espionage, the movie is tighter, more controlled than Inception. The central concept allows much less freedom than Inception's ""dream sharing"" did, but that's precisely the limitations that make it so exhilarating and satisfying to watch.The policy is ""no hand holding here"". We're sharing the view of the Protagonist spy, and have to figure out what's happening with as few clues as he gets. Active viewing is required to connect the dots. It would be bad if every movie was like that, but from time to time it's a refreshing change.Tenet is a very intense experience from first minute to last with little breathing room, efficiently highlighted by a pervasive soundtrack. It should delight all fans of Nolan's no-nonsense hard sci-fi style. And personally, it's my new favorite Nolan movie.
So, why 5/10?The sound in my theater was ridiculously loud. Other reviewers have reported the same experience, which leads me to believe that the culprit is the movie, not the theater. The voices are way quieter than the rest, which forces projectionists to choose between damaging people's ears and leaving half the dialogues inaudible. I've noticed that a lot of critics who pan the movie complain about not hearing the dialogues. It's easy to understand how frustrated one would be in a movie where every line can hold a key plot element.For a high-budget movie by a veteran director, there is simply no excuse. It's entirely on the movie for failing such a critical element.Even the best movie isn't worth getting hearing damage, hence 5/10."
1454,"Wow. I just came out of the cinema and am speechless.... I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan & this movie certainly did not disappoint! Tenet is guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat the entire movie! It is full of action, suspense & thrill! The cinematography and score is incredible, this is definitely a movie you want to experience in the cinema! Well done Nolan!"
1455,"Tenet is a brilliantly crafted and breathtaking action movie. Similarly to Inception, Christopher Nolan introduces us to a phenomenal and mind-bending world following a certain set of rules, and then pushes them to their limits. The story is intriguing and keeps you guessing at every turn. Furthermore, the cast is excellent, the stunts are impressive, and the cinematography is striking.All in all, I highly recommend this film as it is very entertaining and its original plot will keep you on the edge of your seat."
1456,"Best music and sound effects ever.
However that cost you to lose half if the dialogue (I am starting to believe he made it on purpose)
Visually and acoustically a marvel.
I admire Nolan so much.It needs to be rewatched again for sure.
If anyone is not having english as their first language, Seek subtitles, as you will feel underwhelmed with so many different accents.After the first twist, it will make you even more confused but stay focused.GREAT!
PS:for me still Interstellar is his top film"
1457,"Two men have a mission to prevent a Russian oligarch from ending the world and preventing a 3rd world war.
Tenet gives us an interesting premise, as is usual in Nolan's films, and takes us on an incredible and above all interesting journey, especially if you are admirers of this time travel theme, paradoxes etc. lead duo David Washington and Robert Pattinson present us with incredible chemistry and a mystery about the past and future which leaves a sense of intrigue that is able to capture attention throughout the entire film. The photography is incredible, contributing to the growing tension of the film and even better is the CGI that did the budget.
The negative points would be some expositivity in some dialogues and some action scenes are a little confusing, but nothing that will harm the experience.
An advice is to watch the film with the utmost attention and open mind."
1458,"Tenet might be the most Nolanesque movie yet. It takes all the quirks of a Nolan movie to the extreme and removes all the distractions. This movie is just raw and constructed plot that will claim your full attention.Tent has a complicated plot but at the same time Nolan puts the explanation right in front of you, making the movie very obvious. It's just that those clues require context to be fully understood. This is how he invites you to watch his movies over and over again. Take The Prestige as an example where Nolan used the same technique just that in Tenet the clues are somewhat harder to notice.Personally, I think that is what cinema is made for. It is about more than just watching a movie, it is about the experience. And boy what an experience Nolan delivers with Tenet.I have seen it in cinema three times already and I am really looking forward to watch it countless more times at home.Seriously, go see it in a cinema with a big screen and do so multiple times. It will be worth it."
1459,"I've never watched a movie where the sound mixing problems detract with such impact. Monotonous, painfully loud, distracting music and sound effects obliterate much of the dialogue even in relatively calm scenes. The booms, constant in most of the music soundtrack are louder than the explosions and helicopters. Don't watch this in a theater unless you want hearing damage!"
1460,"The concept is great, actors, spots, music, shots - are amazing. What's missing is the sense of ""what did I just watch""? Too complicated and too many dialogues which require some knowledge in physics, math and imagination."
1461,"I enjoyed it at first but halfway though I got bored, every minute felt like an hour. The plot was complicated it's one of those movies you need to watch 2-4 times to understand. Conclusion, would not go to watch again and the tickets were 50 or 60 bucks Christopher Nolan lost it."
1462,"Boring, confusing, story never got me interested like former Nolan movies."
1463,"Well, I can only understand the rate of 7.9 because people here is huge fan of Nolan and maybe of some cast as well...
Sound was to loud and I'm happy to get subtitles otherwise would be quite impossible task to understand all this backs and forwards scenes!"
1464,"As many others reviewing here, I love Nolan's work and I never thought I'd be giving his movie any less than an 8. Boy was I wrong.Sound
After the seeing Tenet in IMAX, I am shocked that someone actually okay-ed this to be released into cinemas. I have no idea what anyone was saying for about 80% of the movie.
I read somewhere that it's up to the cinemas to control the sound levels, but how come it's not such a major problem with other movies and the issue is so consistent worldwide? What a joke.Characters and storyline
Even if the dialog was crystal clear, here's where the movie lacks the most. The core of most Nolan's movies lies in a character or a human quality that viewers can relate to, set in an awesome-concept universe. The concept was secondary, while the human quality was usually the primary focus of the movie.
Tenet flips that around. The time-inversion is the core of the movie, while the characters are just there and stuff is happening to them. From the very little information I gathered from the dialogue, there is absolutely no background to them, not even the main protagonist (pun intended), no motivation, very little charm, and no relatability. The story is full of clichés and old tropes that were cringeworthy at best. I did not care if anyone survives or reaches their goal. That was the most disappointing part for me.Visuals and action
The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because at least most of the action scenes were quite entertaining. The special FX and visuals were beautiful and fun to watch. On the other hand, in my opinion they don't compare to the stuff we got to see in Interstellar or Inception.All in all, I do not recommend this movie. It's painfully long and forgettable. I hope Nolan will surprise us again in the future, but for now, I will stick to re-watching his previous fantastic works. Though many reviewers suggest it, I will not watch Tenet again to 'comprehend its genius'. It had its chance with me and failed terribly."
1465,"This seems to be a new trend in movies - Screw up the audio, and make it almost impossible to understand what is being said by the actors.
Visually, it looked quite exciting, with great action. But the sheer lack of clarity of the spoken voices just killed it for me.Please bring back Audio Specialists in the movie making industry!"
1466,"Half of the experience of this movie was killed by extremely loud sound effects and background score. At times, you can't even hear the dialogs. The other half was pretty much killed by poorly structured plot. It feels like Nolan's pursuit of making overly complicated plots have gone beyond audience understanding.The antagonist's motivation was too weak. And you don't feel any association with the protagonist either. It seemed like Nolan didn't want to spend any time building up his characters or even the plot. The whole movie felt rushed."
1467,"Taking a look around on imdb I've seen several very misleading reviews about this film that claim that it overuses exposition, that it has too loud audio, that the action scenes weren't good enough etc. so I just had to give my thoughts on this film.Let's start with the claims that there's too much exposition. Compared to other Nolan films like Inception or Interstellar there is much less: in those films usually a character explains step by step what is going on, in Tenet there is no such character and there are only tidbits of information given by some lines of dialogue.
It is true that the first 40 mins are sort of ""worldbuilding"" scenes, but that's again something that Nolan had already done in the past: Inception spends nearly an hour to explain the dreams concept, Interstellar takes 40 mins before going to space etc.About the sound mixing: the audio is similar to Tenet, super loud, but when it overlaps on dialogue pieces it's always pieces of dialogue that are unnecessary: a man doing a tour of a facility and telling stuff that is irrelevant to the plot, while the character observes details of the alarm system, for example.A story is defined as well written when it uses all the elements it presents: believe it or not, upon a second rewatch I realised how deeply this thing goes into Tenet, everone and everything is related to the main topic and the plot. You have to be extra careful to look for the connections but they are there (even if just glimpses - it's a Nolan film, a puzzle to recompose).
Once you're able to reconstruct the whole thing, well, you'll realise that Tenet is much more complex than how you deemed it, and so are the action sequences. I'd like to repeat it: if something doesn't check out, you missed something, at the second view you'll understand it better. If being confused by a film means to you that the film itself is not good, well, remember the ending of 2001: A Space Odyssey, that one was super confusing and I certainly didn't understand it the first time I've seen it, yet 2001 is considered a masterpiece.
Tenet may be the most complicated Nolan film: much is implied, much is hard to understand, little is explained clearly, yet details, short glimpses and elements suggest everything. Upon a first view, I wasn't sure if I understood the plot. Upon second view, I think I've understood it all.
So yes, go watch it a second time before judging."
1468,"A CIA agent is given an unusual assignment: track down the source of inverted bullets, bullets that move backwards through time. This will hopefully lead him to the source of entropy-reversal technology from the future.Christopher Nolan is one of my favourite directors, with Memento ranking, for me, as the second greatest movie of all time. Being written and directed by him you know it is going to be clever and complex.Here, however, he lays on the complexity but fails to make it entirely understandable. Twists and cleverness just for twists and cleverness sake. Throw in the fact that the dialogue often gets drowned out by the loud, droning, this-is-a-key-moment-so-needs-loud-music score (a trick Nolan picked up in Dunkirk, where we had that irritating droning sound throughout the movie) and the plot is difficult to follow. At a point I gave up trying to understand the concepts behind the plot, or follow the plot itself, and just went along for the ride.In addition to being not entirely comprehensible, the film is more an action movie than an intelligent thriller. It has many traits of a Bond film: jet-setting locations, find A to get to B to get to C with the slimmest links between the different parts in the chain. This all an excuse for some outlandish scheme or action sequence. Plus the villain has the opportunity to quickly kill the hero several times but chooses not too - very Bond-like. Add in the perfectly-choreographed action sequences, many big, bright explosions and it's more style than substance.This said, it is reasonably enjoyable. The action sequences are well done, it moves at a great pace and doesn't feel like a 2.5-hour movie.Performances are pretty solid, especially from John David Washington (in the lead role) and Elizabeth Debicki. Kenneth Branagh does his best fake Russian accent and seems every inch the Bond villain. I have never liked Robert Pattinson, thanks to that Twilight crap, but was hoping here he could prove he had some decent dramatic acting skills. Sadly, no, he doesn't.More style than substance, and below Christopher Nolan's usual standard, but reasonably entertaining."
1469,Film just takes you on such a ride words can't describe it a MUST SEE
1470,"Saw this in Denmark at the premiere last Night. Unfortunately the theater wasnt even close to half full, so Im a bit worried about the box Office for this one. That being Said, i have to give an honest review: Its absolutely a good movie. But its not a 10/10 by far. Its not even close to being Nolans best. the plot is not as fancy or hard to follow at some people make it out to be. Its all explained in the first act, and after that they just run with the premise. Not much suprise, just showing It undlod more and more. Unfortunately it kinda drops the Ball in the 3rd act. The villain is a one dimensional stereotype, and i expected more from Nolan who Usually always crafts characters with depth and motivation.Whats good:
Robert Parttinson! Clearly the Best thing in this movie! Totally steals the show!
The premise: its interesting and Wil keep You focused throughout as it unfolds more and more.
The soundtrack: WoW!Whats bad: The villain. Too one dimensional and hollow.
The pacing: its kinda all over the place.
The third act. Its just bad."
1471,What an amazing filmUp there with inceptionMust admit very confusing at first but all makes sense in the endHighly recommend this film
1472,"I really hate having to sit through bad films but when they make them extra long it's like a slow death. You could see this film is trying to affect you in the same way Inception did but it's just a very pointless story line and a pretty bad script. When too many things don't add up and they have so many unrealistic stunts and responses I just start to switch off.The only reason I didn't give this film a 1/10 is because it has some really nice locations, some nice gadgets and boats and the sound design and sound track are pretty good. Oh and the bad Russian guy did a good job and was very believable. The rest was atrocious.I'd save your money on this one."
1473,Utter pony. Loved everything Nolan has done before but this made no sense & just using rewind effects is shockingly bad. Also glad Hans Zimmer was busy & not interested.
1474,"This movie was a poor fitting puzzle. After watching it; I was asked by family what it was about, and honestly couldn't tell them. The plot is difficult to follow, not only due to the complexities within it, but mainly because of how heavily this movie leans on dialogue to establish everything within this movie, and often the most important dialogue occurs during loud music, explosions, or behind a mask. Said dialogue often consisted of random scientific words thrown at you like plutonium, entropy, etc. and those scenes are always annoying because you know the movie is banking on you not understanding what they mean, and when you do it just deconstructs the entire gimmick of the movie.This movie had multiple moments which were really, really good. But for a movie based on the concept of inverted time, where getting immersed and suspending disbelief is crucial to enjoyment, these moments were too few and far between. I spent the majority of the movie playing catchup, and by the finale I was not in the slightest bit immersed and as such did not get to enjoy the suspense which was clearly being built. I still don't know who the final conflict was against, nor the point of the opening scene which just seemed so pointless.I didn't really enjoy this movie. I think there will be two camps- those who think it's a masterpiece, and those who don't know what the point was. I know if I rewatch Tenet I'll enjoy it more, and maybe if it ever comes on TV I'll switch it on and watch some of it, but it was too illogical, complicated, and overall unenjoyable for me to consider rewatching it."
1475,"Such a talented writer. I had troubles understanding things and actions sometimes, but it's not because the director did a bad job at writing, it's because the sheer amount of twisted, mystical things happening in this masterpiece. Love it a lot, cannot wait to watch other Nolan movies!"
1476,"I was not expecting to completely understand what was happening in the movie, after hearing some of my friends. Hell, I didn't even know what the movie was gonna be about. But since I've enjoyed all Nolan films so far I just bought a ticket and let it all come at me. It turns out that although the story is quite complex, it is executed perfectly through little clues and great storytelling. It's a movie where you need to keep paying attention. And in my opinion, it'd a great movie. I loved the acting, the soundtrack is perfect and it's visually perfect."
1477,"First of all, this is the biggest and the boldest form of Nolan's cinema. He took it to a totally different level as the interwoven storyline will need at least three views to untangle it.Just like Dark series, it's not something you watch and enjoy only. it's a puzzle game with 1000 pieces that needs to be arranged in a short period of time.
Let me start by commenting on the acting ; it was beyond phenomenal. We did miss the Hanz Zimmer touch but the music was very good.
The most fascinating thing is the plot itself. Nolan played with time in a way that we have never seen before. As Albert Einstein said once"" past and future aren't real but an illusion "" Nolan apply and direct this idea exceptionally perfect."
1478,"Loved this movie. It's very well acted! Lots of action back and forth. Or would that be lots of inverted action forth & back?!? So did Kenneth Branagh own a doomsday bomb 💣, machine or something? I really tried to pay attention to this movie but I was lost when they started making bullets move with dishwasher gloves. Good film. Go see it. Then you can explain your interpretation of it to me. Okay peace out ✌🏼"
1479,"My first movie since February due to Corona situation. This movie has such a big marketing, I said I need to see it on the big screen. Boy I was disappointed.
Everything about this movie sucks. The plot is childish. Acting is average. Special effects are non existing, unless you are thrilled to see some scenes played backwards.
The ending is predictible which makes it very hard for you to stay in that cinema chair for 2 and a half hours."
1480,"Loved the movie,The story line evolves and that is what I really liked about the movie. You kind of learn with the main character and besides all the visual effects and the way they shot and directed the movie this really contributed to the overall experience.The pace is quite slow at the beginning but then it builds up and in the end goes full circle. A typical Nolan movie that I have to add, so if you're a lover of this previous works this one will definitely be a great movie to watch."
1481,"Everyone giving this 5 or under because they couldn't understand it at first watch, come on guys. Give it a chance, but do know that it is very loud. It has an awesome score, though."
1482,"Tenet had a lot of the ""new Christopher Nolan movie"" hype, and the people who enjoy his movies were quite excited. There has always been, and always will be, that group of people of see Christopher Nolan movies as pretentious and bland, and while I've always enjoyed his movies, Tenet really felt worthy of that critique.
The most widespread problem with the whole movie was that it felt like Nolan was leaning on the concept of ""If I make the dialogue, exposition, and concept sound super complex and smart, no one will realize they don't know what's going on."" An argument can be made that all of his films fall under this problem, but in movies like Inception and even Interstellar, the complicated plot and subject matter could still be deciphered by the audience. And, there was enough to readily latch onto to make the audience want to piece things together. Tenet was confusing and very fast paced from the get go, and never really gave the audience any time to breathe. Not to mention that 70% of the dialogue was exposition dumps, and due to the sound mixing drowning out the dialogue more often than not, the convoluted explanations of what was happening never actually made things easier to follow. And you can have a complicated plot and premise worthy of the most elite and pretentious audience without making things confusing. In fact, complicated shouldn't mean confusing.The plot and pacing also didn't assist in the audience's ability to follow and be invested in what was happening. At least for me, it was pretty sporadic that I really cared about what was happening on screen, mostly due to that I often wasn't sure what the characters were working toward or trying to prevent. And I'd like to think I can follow movies pretty well, and if this were just a case of the plot and filmmaking being ""too complex"" and going over my head, that'd be fine. But it really seemed that the writing was problematic. Because things were not clear enough, soon enough. The rules of inverting were explained in a very dense exposition dump at the beginning, and around 2/3's into the movie after a shift in the plot, and for a premise as interesting as this one, the audience should know the rules concretely early on. And this isn't synonymous to the audience being babysat through the whole plot and needing their handheld through the whole film. Back to Inception, which is a reasonable comparison since it's another complicated thriller by the same director and writer, the rules of inception and dreaming were explained effectively and well early on. This could've been the same in Tenet, but we only had rushed exposition dumps. Not to mention, we have an action scene right off the bat and subsequent secret agency drama that is never really explained. Starting the audience with something chaotic and plunging them into the action isn't inherently a bad thing, but this was a confusing start. And The Protagonist being a part of the Tenet organization is just sort of thrown in there after he proves his loyalty to them? To his old team? Did he have an old organization or was it the same as the Tenet group? Anyway, he learns about the time inverting and then just...starts doing things to, prevent the impending war? Honestly, one of the other biggest problems is that the goals of the characters and of the story in general, aren't that clear until the end of the second act.So the character and plot goals, the way the Tenet organization and rules of inverting works, and what our characters were actually working toward with the drawing/Andrei shenanigans, all needed to be clearer sooner. It was difficult to latch onto the plot, and therefore, become invested in the story. You don't necessarily need to be limited by a three of five part story arc, but there really didn't feel like any story arc, whatsoever. It felt like meandering and random plot points that were working toward something that wasn't clear, until the lights were turned on and we learned what the characters were trying to prevent, and what they needed to do to do so.Now there are still pros along with these cons. They didn't outweigh them, but they were there. The performances, especially John David Washington and Kenneth Branagh, were amazing. JDW has this unique, reserved charisma that made watching him on screen very captivating. His chemistry with Robert Pattinson, who also had a great performance as Neil, made their scenes together the best of the movie. Elizabeth Debicki is criminally underrated as an actor in general, and she gave a great performance. It was a bit of a bummer that she was the only consistent female character in the movie and was also a victim of an abusive marriage, but she got a fulfilling arc where she defeated her husband when she couldn't in the past so, that's good at least. I guess. I wonder if Christopher Nolan will ever write more than 3 female characters in one movie, one of which not being a dead or victimized wife figure.Anyway, there were also some really interesting action scenes. There were two early on that were pretty traditional but done very well and not gratuitous. And the premise of inverting time is a very interesting one, that fostered a handful of very interesting half backward action scenes. In all honesty {spoiler} the action scene where Neil and The Protagonist go back to the Oslo airport and end up being the two they were fighting against in the past, was really interesting and satisfying to watch.Overall, the whole viewing experience was okay. There were enjoyable things, yes, but the movie was overwhelmingly just exposition dumps that didn't really explain things enough, some cool action scenes and music, decent cinematography, and great acting performances. It's not terribly memorable, and you certainly felt the long runtime a few times when the pacing lagged. Christopher Nolan is a name that comes with high expectations, and unfortunately, this didn't live up as much as it could've. 7/10."
1483,"For the first 30 minutes of the movie, I kept thinking to myself ""This is nice but I'll never want to see this again"". The dialogues felt rushed, the characters uninteresting.Then come the core of the movie, the whole pitch that makes it work. The scene that reveals the genius mechanics of reversed time. It's brillant, mind bending, coherent, visually stunning, I loved it, I was hooked, I knew I was in for my money and I enjoyed every single second.After this brillant piece of work came more downtime, where way too much time is allowed for the sadly written Kat, she removes, by herself, 2 stars from this masterpiece. All of her lines are boring and simplistic, I even caught myself laughing out loud at one of her lines because it felt so un-spontaneous and dumb.This incoherent rythm keeps on going for the end of the movie, you are in turn breathless, then bored to tears by the simplistic dialogues. If it weren't for the brilliant handling of ""Time"", this would be a terrible movie. The stakes at play are extremely basic, they somehow make it work, but I would have expected more from a Nolan movie.It's brilliant and revolutionnary in many aspects of filmmaking. For this, I enjoyed it, a lot, and I will watch this movie again. However, the story feels rushed, you can clearly see that much of the thinking went into the brilliant handling of intertwined/reverted scenes, not that much in the story itself, that disappointed me.It's a great entertainment, not the greatest story."
1484,"Whenever you're watching a film that deals in time travel, there is going to be confusion. Here you have a movie where timeliness are crossing each other and nothing seems to make sense. If you walked out halfway, I would agree that this movie is confusing. If you stayed until the very end and are still confused... then perhaps you should avoid these types of films.Christopher Nolan always tries to challenge the viewer and here he goes all in. However, the story is not very complicated. It runs in a linear fashion, but multiple time elements get thrown in between. Sometimes it is overwhelming and you're asking yourself ""what is the point of it all?"" And then you go ""Ok, I get it."" In my opinion, this is not an action movie. It is a drama with elements of action. If you go in wanting to see an action movie, you may be disappointed.The truth is that this movie really has no concept of time. You don't really know what time the protagonist is from. You know the time in which the film takes place, but not sure which time the characters are from. Rob's character seems to be hoping all over the place. In fact, I am inclined to believe that he is the son of the Russian terrorist as an adult. Which would mean that the protagonist is from the future as well. This is made clear in Neil's and Protagonists last conversation. We know how Rob dies, but we don't know how they met yet. It would also explain why Protagonist is so driven to save Kat and hers son. Anyway, not going to spend this time to go over theories.The movie was loud at times. I didn't have any trouble understanding what was being said, but it felt like you were in the middle of what was happening. Typically a good voice dub would correct this, but for some reason they passed on this. The music was too loud at times as well, but I saw the film at the drive in and had full control of the volume, so it wasn't too distracting. I thought the soundtrack worked. I missed the Zimmer sound, but maybe it would have been too reminiscent of Inception.All in all this was a very simple story, but with complex elements of physics and time travel. So if you wanna see it and critique the science, then you are going to miss out on the story. Acting could have been a bit better at times of tension, but the story had good pacing. I would definitely watch again, knowing what I know now from the first watch.So in essence I am going to go back, rewatch something that already happened, with prior knowledge and approach it differently. If that seemed confusing, then you might wanna pass on the first watch."
1485,"It's literally impossible to grasp everything you see the first time you watch it. I'm not sure if you will the second time, i haven't tried and probably won't. The reason being i got a headache watching this movie. If you want a movie to relax and have fun, this is not that movie.Not only is the concept hard enough to grasp, the audio is also, well, inaudible. Subtitles can go a long way for this movie.Very boring for a long time. My wife slept mid-movie, and a couple left the cinema after an hour or so. I don't blame them. I only stayed myself because I'm a Nolan fan, and thought it will all be great later. Maybe it was great at the end, but if it was, I didn't understand it."
1486,"Tenet left me speechless. It's mystique is lovable. I immediately wanted to re-watch it if only to end the movie with a little more amazement and a little less bewilderment. As with Nolan films, mystery is an asset. Tenet gets 10/10"
1487,"This film is the bomb! Outrageous concept, incredible effects, thrills and suspense topped-off with high caliber performances and embraceable characters.I won't try to get into details because the film is cerebral and it takes time to wrap your mind around the concept. You will have 2.5 hours of amazing FX, thought provoking and mind-bending intrigue and an insatiable desire to watch it again-it IS that good!Kudos to the brilliant cast, Director, and writers. This film excels in a potentially new genre that inspires people to do things like; walk backward, re-think time, and pay closer attention to the way we treat our planet."
1488,"I like Christopher Nolan movies, mostly. Often times the dialogue can be a bit hammy and the movie doesn't hold up As well following the first movie theater watch, but that's ok. To me, they're a better casual flick than some MCU trash or Fast Cars 18.This movie though? It's just the culmination of what's already the worst year in memory.Dialogue? What I heard of it was TRASH. The audio in this movie is TERRRRRIBLE and I probably only heart 20/30% of it. What I did hear was usually cringe inducing and pretentious, causing me to burst into momentary giggle fits. ""YOU BREAK ZE HEART OF ZE TIGER!!!""The action? Unfortunately, the movie blows it's impressive action chops early on with a fantastic sequence at an airport. This sequence reminded me of inception with its impressively mind bending editing and dependence on practicality. After this though, prepare to be assaulted with barrages of war shattering explosions and meh-tier visuals. The last half hour of this movie is laughably predictable and horrible.I really have allot more to say but I cannot bear the idea of spending anymore time of my life thinking about this movie. Don't see it"
1489,Not the worst movie I have ever seen but definitely the worst I have see. In 2020. Sooooooooo hard to understand the talking and could have been 40 minutes shorter. Don't take anyone under 18 years old. My 14 and 15 year old played on their phones after the first 40 minutes because they couldn't follow the story line.
1490,"Tenet is Christopher Nolan's Magnum Opus. On the technical side, few films in history have anything like the action of this film. Every Scene is Magic, and you will think, ""How making this is even possible?"". And that ""No Green Screen"" rule is paying off. Because of that, you can believe the most unbelievable things are happening on the screen. Tenet never looks like animation or something full of CGI effects. And when you watch it, You will probably accept that fact is so important.
Suppose someone mutes this film and watches it. It's perfection. If someone shot the picture off and only listen to the sound of this film, It's Perfection. So When they get combined, Tenet has become an experience like no other.
Ludwig Göransson's Awesome Score has been synced with every scene and is adding to all of them. I love Hans Zimmer, but right now, I don't think even that great man was capable of doing this. The reason is this music feels different from anything I've ever heard in any Christopher Nolan Film.
I've watched Tenet twice (So far); the First time, I loved it, and the second time, I loved it. The script does a great job of presenting everything to you in the best possible way. And at the same time, Tenet has fewer exhibition scenes than Interstellar or Inception. So every time you watch it, you will be focused on more things. But It's understandable and self-explaining. The reason that a lot of people will more like The Story for the second time is the fact that THE FILM IS UNBELIEVABLY BEAUTIFUL. It has some shots, which made me speechless and gave me pure joy. As much as I couldn't focus my mind on the story and wanted to be just thinking about the Perfect Picture, I'm watching.
This film will stand the test of time. I don't want to spoil anything, So I can't talk about how much I love some of the characters and how the actors have got chosen with no miss fire. But even if you read the full screenplay of Tenet, Watching it is ten times better than just knowing the whole story. Tenet is THE Cinema, at it's very very best."
1491,"I'm still confused walking out the theater. I thought Momento, Inception and Interstellar were those that took a couple watches to fully understand the film, but Nolan outdid himself with this one. Amazing acting, amazing direction of course, and the effects and choreography was brilliant. Definitely another Nolan masterpiece."
1492,I can't do that more than 6. Somehow I know that the film is made
1493,"From the start of the film it's obvious where the storyline would go. You just know the protagonist is the guy who directs everything that would happen. The airport scene gives everything away. The protagonist fighting a guy in full gear and in the opposite room his partner who takes of the helmet of the ""other"" guy. It spoiled the entire movie. I just knew it had to be the protagonist who was mirrored in the same timeline. Same for the boat scene where the wive sees ""another"" woman jump into the water. Never use the same trick twice. But hey....Nolan does the same trick over and over again. The action makes it watchable, but a 6 it is."
1494,"Time soup with a pale aroma and stale spices. Tenet is a complex intertwining enigma with a mixture of monochrome acting, with a multitude of incomprehensible sentences and phrases that should explain the universe in which the main protagonists found themselves.Expectation, reasoning, excitement, and catharsis are adrift in this collage of time dilation. The modern viewer will be unmoored in a sea of attempts by the young cast to explain time travel zones and their passage through them. Of course, the famous director is again trying to intimidate us and throw us into admiring the ingenious idea that exudes the whole movie.
This time, it seems to have lacked a bit of aroma, simplicity, and essence that creates magic on the movie screen. To quote the legendary poet: ""I wanted a lot, I started a lot, but the hour of brisk, has swept me away.""The very idea that the whole world dies out with one man is very immature and indigestible. The average viewer, and even the slightly more intelligent one, will not forgive such diegesis from a legendary director who celebrated hit after hit in his magnificent career.Today's cinema cannot boast itself with originality and artistic impression. We are living in a world of abundance where everything is in our grasp and has its price. Cinematography is no exception to this. One can hope that the future of modern cinema will bring more elastic and undemanding
approach to Sci-Fi time travel entanglements, like some significant film achievements from the past."
1495,"I really wanted to like this film, but I couldn't. The whole thing is disjointed, nonsensical and incredibly confusing. The storyline is so convoluted it twists itself into knots.
They do try and explain what's going on but 2 hrs is nowhere near enough time for this to make sense. The general plot is another timeline inverts to ours ( I think) hence you get scenes shown going backwards, forwards and even backwards again. It's almost like they had enough time and budget to shoot one hour and to extend it to normal running time the just show most of it in reverse. Sorry but this is the most confusing film ever, no wonder writer and director are one and the same cos noone else will have a scooby, and that includes all of the Matrix films. Generally I love the Nolan films but God did he have a bad hair day with this pne"
1496,This is the first Chris Nolan film since Insomnia that hasn't blown me away. And although Tenet resembles Inception (still Nolan's best film) it is inferior on almost every level.One level where it does impress is spectacle. There are some jaw-dropping sequences and the opening 10 minutes are the most visceral of any movie in recent memory. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is as oppressive as ever but did it have to be so loud?But that's about it. There are no performances here to match Leonardo DiCaprio in Inception (although Ken Branagh is superbly nasty) and the human story just doesn't engage at all. And for me the whole 'reverse entropy' thing lapses into self-parody and just felt a bit silly.
1497,"I watch a movie for the experience not to watch it again so I can understand it completely...it was ok, not boring but nothing WowP.S do not watch it near a speaker"
1498,"The script and concept complicated, too long movie with slow dynamic. Much higher expectations. Actors performance less than average."
1499,"Being a huge fan of inception I was really looking forward to this film, sadly it was a bit of a let down.The plot and concept were good and some of the action scenes were amazing.However, where inception was brilliantly complex this just pushed too far. While trying to enjoy the film it almost ended up like you were trying to solve the most complex riddle ever. This detracted from the suspense. Maybe it was just me and I need to see it again but if that's the case it tells me something."
1500,Yes. Watch it. Dont let yourself get into spoilers. If this movie doesnt save cinema i dont know what will.
1501,"Exists in that middle ground between good and bad, that place where you feel... Nothing. Having not been to the the cinema in 6 months, feeling nothing for 2 and a half hours is an antic-climactic state of being. It's one of those films where you need to watch an 'explanation' video of it on youtube afterwards, except... well, you just don't care."
1502,"Emotionally zero, this movie becomes senseless as the director seems to have made a movie for just himself..Just like how m night shyamalan became a joke, due to overindulgence into self obsession, Nolan lost his marbles fully with this crap of a movie.Watch it if you have 2 hours to waste and add time to recover from frustration n confusion."
1503,"I was watching the movie and I was asking my self.""Who paid for this parody"". Very bad acting from Washington and omplicated without reason story. I am very disappointed...."
1504,"Saw this movie last night without knowing anything about it beforehand.
I've avoided watching any trailer and did not read any reviews since they tend to spoil the experience.The very first minute the movie started I was unable to understand what was going on, and I was unable to catch up to the unintelligible storyline.This has never happend to me before to this extend and it has ruined the entire movie for me.Every second I was asking myself: What is going on? Who is that guy? Where are they now? How did they get here? Why are they doing that? When did this happen?The very fast paced script, editing and overly loud soundtrack did not help to comprehend it either. Somehow I believe there is a very clever story beneath it all, but since the movie does not explain anything I could not care about any of it.Half way through the movie I gave up trying to wrap my head around it and by the end of the movie it left me frustrated and wanted to ask my money back.Movies like Inception and Interstellar can also be hard to understand the first time around and rewatching those movies has made them better.Maybe the same will happen for Tenet, but since the first experience was so horrible I'm not looking forward in rewatching it at all.I do hope these fast paced scripted and edited movies are not becoming a trend."
1505,"Here is my problem
My problem is that i felt nothing.. although cinema In first place should make me feel Something but all i had to to do is running after nolan's class of quantum physics. No nolan, i think you missed this shot.
And i gave 5 for the effort only nothing else"
1506,"I understood the general overall plot of the movie and it was visually spectacular, but there was great chunks of it where I had no idea what was going on, or who certain characters were in particular scenes. I don't mind going to see a movie more than once at the cinema if I enjoy it. But I don't think you should have to go twice just in the hope of understanding what was going on. For a director who loves messing with time, this is possibly peak Nolan."
1507,Watch for the first time it's a 7 watch for second time it's a 9 watch for third time and there aren't enough stars to describe the genius of Christopher Nolan. This gets a 9 because of the score which i found too loud eclipsing dialogue. Watch it!!!!!!!
1508,"I honestly tried..twice !
Wait for rental and save your money."
1509,"I watched this film 4 days ago and I still can't get my head round it,ive watched over 2000 films in my time and this 1 stumped me, anyone who says they understood it are pathological liars,I give it a 5 because the cinematography was good"
1510,"I've watched this film twice and think it's a fantastic cinematic work and great sense for many details. At the same time has some annoying mistakes in the plot, maybe because the plot is very complex and it's impossible to make every straight and reverse storyline totally accurate and keep the suspense and intensity in the movie at the same time.For complex time-travel storyline, Tenet doesn't even come close to the Netflix German TV-serie Dark, which I think is a masterpiece in that aspect. In my mind, this is a masterpiece in a film-making, but not as a satisfying time-travel mystery."
1511,"Truly mindbending movie to watch and try and understand the first time around. I applaud the thought behind this story, but trying to cram all of this content into a single 2.5hour movie ruined it for me. I never had time to digest what was going on. There was no down time. Just confusing dialogue and complex scenes back to back until the movie ended. Characters would flash between different countries instantaneously with no transition whatsoever. Half way through my brain just overheated and I was just looking at the screen with smoke coming out of my ears trying to keep up.
Great visuals, check
Great idea, check
Great soundtrack, check
Sound - fail. Complicated rapid-fire dialogue that you can barely hear. Soundtrack is nice though.
Execution... complete failure in my books. I don't want to have to watch the same movie 3+ times in a row to maybe understand what happened. Truth be told, if you watched it multiple times it probably still wouldn't make sense and you'd end up going down an infinite rabbit hole.
I feel bad giving it a 6, but since after watching it once I just feel like I wasted my time...."
1512,This movie was made for morons. You couldn't hear a word that's spoken because it has a soundtrack screaming over the dialog. Its like watching people fighting in reverse for 2 hours and not understanding a thing. Complete waste of life.
1513,"It seems to me, its just a new remake of the matrix story in more complex way."
1514,"The first 30 minutes of this movie had my head spinning. I had to re-watch it twice just to understand the movies basic premise. The plot moves along so quickly it is as if the director was trying to compress a 2000-page epic novel into a short film. Lines are said so quickly and monotonously that there is a total absence of any emotion, and characters who are meeting each other for the first time appear to have been friends for years. Overall, this just makes for poor acting. This main character is a 007 wannabe that doesn't even come close to the savoir faire of James Bond. This movie was definitely over-hyped."
1515,"Christopher Nolan is not the worst director in the world. But as a sci-fi one, he competes with the likes of Michael Bay. Even Michael Bay makes more enjoyable movies. This film could have been so much better; but without character development, the story is rashed and the bad cinematography did not help.
What a mess!"
1516,"Ridiculous idea (ok it is SF), can't cover shallow PC correct (typical bad-white, good-black scenario) movie with bad main role actor. One of the female actress sum up something like this: good watch and suit not cover You aren't mach to this word... Main (The Protagonist - lol) actor not match to role which he try to play. This was the first problem. First half of the movie is wtf-movie, later we can follow this ridiculous idea whom Nolan wrote after maybe shot of lsd or vodka because he try to proof of the whole the world: I'm super-movie-maker, and I will make film super creative, intelligent, no one made something like this before... Ok. do it, but this movie fall short in area: pay off... because nobody want to self-torture and pay for that (ok, some people like this ;) ) Bad idea, bad execution, bad sound, bad acting of >protagonist<, and who the f pick this guy ??? Many cliches-talking. Is this the same director who made Interstellar or Batman ??? Whoow... what a cra..."
1517,"The main storyline is very simple. A man tries to stop the world's destruction. The dialogues are flat. The characters have no depth/development. There is the Nolan special thing - Time Inversion, which is fun. It is like any other Nolan film but with worse plot."
1518,"I had to pause and go back a several times to make sure I saw what I thought I had seen. To take in some of the details. I kept pausing and rewatching scenes but I could not believe the technicality of this scenes. I can only compare this Inception but much much deeper. At the end it says ""Directed by Christopher Nolan"" and I said ""OOHOOHHH, OF COURSE!"" Brilliant. Enjoy. Watching it again uninterrupted to catch everything I missed."
1519,"5 stars for acting and idea,which is interesting ,even though done messy.My biggest problem with this movie is my absolute inability to connect to any of the characters ...When Inception made you sweat and almost cry and be flabbergasted ,this one fails to engage.Not satisfactory at all for the director on the level of mr.Nolan..."
1520,"Was this all about,I didn't understand anything in this movie, it was way too complex, but then I was way too drunk when I watched it."
1521,"If you enjoy watching a movie where you can't make out 50% of the dialog then this is for you! This had such an affect on the movie and infuriated me! The movie is hard to understand as is without the actors mumbling along for most of it!
Poor from Nolan, I've heard he tried to be clever here when it came to the sound but it's completely backfired! I hated this movie! 1 star is too much!
And people who are calling this a masterpiece obviously didn't understand the movie and weren't bothered about hearing the dialog!"
1522,"Tenet has a good cast, great ideas, complicated/twisted moments etc etc cinematography stuff. Unfortunately, as a whole, all these high quality elements just do not work for me. During the whole movie I've been waiting for the moment: 'Oh, ok, now it is clear', but that did not happen. So in the end emotionally there was no connection to the movie and that was quite disappointing."
1523,If you can understand my review title it contains a spoiler and it doesn't contain a spoiler as well... Depends on ur perspective..!!
1524,"In simple words - A puzzle marathon... yes, the audience needs to keep pace with the sprinters (protoganists) running the 'save the world' marathon with observation and then you get the satisfaction. A little miss may make a mess (which is already a mess puzzle). The movie can also be said - a Nolan's Bond movie.Another brilliant cognitive exercise offered by Nolan. Not much decoding needed as his previous. It's a clean narrative if you listen carefully. After years, this could be one of the easy movies of Nolan on par with Memento. Most critics complained about the muffled conversations and too loud bgm. With subtitles, those weren't an issue.The action sequences are mind boggling and brilliant! You will know why Nolan was adamant to give the theatrical experience to his audience.Nolan doesn't put a 'I am brilliant' show-off as some say. He is serious trying to explore his endurance and advance his own previous leaps. We just need to let our ego to accept 'Yes, he is brilliant and an innovator'. Still a tough competitor for my favorite Dennis Villeneuve. To sum up, keep aside the early critics - Tenet, is a good one.Those who don't have the habit of keen observation and to think back & forth can avoid this movie. For others, its a visual and cognitive treat."
1525,"This movie started well...but then, it got more and more confusing. Nothing made much sense. After 30 minutes you don't really know what's going on. I don't think the actors know...A lot of money for a movie that at some point became even tedious. Not worth my time. I almost stopped watching."
1526,"The movie is just not worth watching it again to understand it completely.
It is lacking storyline and putting too much effort in reverse video, trying to explain moving back in time.
Not much of an effort from Nolan."
1527,"This is a truly cinema experience, every scene is taking you into an exciting world and to be honest I beleive this is the whole point of making movies. Of course you need to watch it at least twice to fully understand this interesting world, like the other Masterpieces from Nolan (Inception, Interstellar etc.) but once you get past that first prejudgment of 'boring', 'make no sense' movie ,you can really enjoy this, otherwise you are just wasting your time.First impression is that nothing make sense, everything is upside down but I think that's the whole point, making every scene unpredictable but once you understand what's happening, you realize (after watching it twice maybe) that everything actually make sense and makes you beleive it can be real in our world.Another thing I love about Nolan's movies is how they are created. So inteligent, oldschool, inovative, genuine and realistic effects, no greenscreens.I will sum up with the below words:
Fantastic, Enormus, Wonderful and Genuine!!!Congrats Nolan and thank you for another Masterpiece!"
1528,"Really hard to understand what the actors were talking about.
Many times I found myself confused wondering what in the movie was happening.
I'm not an expert in physics, so I barely understood something about the inverted time and reactions that would follow that.
Why making a movie so complicated that few people really understood? The majority were ashamed to recognize that they didn't understand much, so they gave a high score that the movie doesn't deserve at all. Anyway it's not their fault, it's the movie that it's not easily understandable.
I don't know..."
1529,"As a big fan of Christopher Nolan's movies I watched this with great anticipation. 2 hours later I was glad not to have made my wife watch this with me. She would have cursed me for wasting 2 hours of her life. This is a movie which leaves you mostly confused but also strangely untouched. The plot just doesn't make sense, the actors remain ill-defined. The sound is awful, it is quite hard to follow the dialogues even if English is your mothertongue. The cinematography is very good, as in any Nolan movie. But that doesn't save the overall movie experience. So only 6 stars from me."
1530,Nearly as insipid as John Wick 3. Terrible script and acting. Embarrassing and cringy. Shot like a 2.5 hour sci-fi tv pilot that never delivers. Start shaking your head and getting out the cold water cause your face is gonna need it. If you like sleep meds you'll love this tsk tsk 007-wannabe (lmao). Lobotomy programming at it's best. *Rated ages 3 and under*. Cheers
1531,The time tricks is intriguing itself. But so many bugs and it makes the whole movie confusing
1532,"I'd like to travel back in time to un-watch this movie. The story moved along too quickly to make any logical sense. Nothing was really explained well, leaving viewers to think ""what?"" most of the time. I'll admit, the acting I'll admit was great, but given the story they had to follow I'd be surprised if the actors even knew what was going on in the movie they starred in."
1533,I almost fell asleep.I hadn't seen a more boring movie recently
1534,The sound mixing ih horrible. I hardly can believe this is a Nolan movie. Literally the I was hoping when this will end.
1535,"I generally enjoy movies that involve elements of time travel, but found this one very difficult to watch. I got so frustrated with the actors that couldn't act, lines that were muffled and hard to understand, and scientific concepts that were presented so quickly and briefly they were hard to understand. I could tell a lot of money was spent making this film, but I thought the concept was very poorly executed. My biggest complaint is that most of the actors did not seem believable or likable and did not make the viewer identify with them or care what happened to them."
1536,"At least I got that tenet spelled forward and backward is the same. After watching about a hour of this movie and not knowing what the hell was going on, I gave up trying. So I just watched for the action. The action and acting were fine, but most people, like me, won't understand what the hell was going on. You can get the overall story line, but what they are actually doing is confusing as hell. The first scene where he met the lady should of gave me a clue. I had no idea what the hell they were talking about, even when she explained it to him."
1537,"The smooth faced black man takes the lead, the young woman is the scientific, and the organisation is run by the mature Asian woman - and on the movie goes ticking woke boxes.That's not the problem.The problem is that none of them can act. Acting is what makes a silly story worth watching.I lasted for twenty minutes of this drivel then had to get out."
1538,"Watch Inception, or The Origin (in pt br) which is a 5 star movie and be careful ... it's not just the director who makes the film, nor a good film should always be complex. This tenet is a mix of Dark, Inception, No Limit of Tomorrow with hints of endless nightmare for those who watch it: full of smugness and patches ... and there will still be 2 ... we are grated ... like colleague Victor Nërokaroki commented ""it is 'scientific' fantasy, an inedible imbecility of nauseating the brain"". But Nolan has something good, but this tenet ..."
1539,"I get it. I do.
All the lines are written in a non-sequential manner. The actual preceding line was spoken 16 minutes earlier and the next line in the same conversation will only come in 16 minutes time. Or at least that's what it seems like.
None of it, none of it, makes sense. People walk into rooms backwards and spout utter sci-fi nonsense then partially un-fight each other while not having previously had any ill effects, therefore meaning that the fight was perfectly harmless and therefore pointless.
Random characters appear then disappear without a trace, while the main protagonist wanders around like he's having to actively force his way through the air then mumbles something which has absolutely nothing to do with the situation.
I'm guessing this must be extremely experimental film making which requires the viewer to frequently stop and take notes from the subtitles then research the internet for what it means."
1540,"I like most Nolan movies. But don't like puzzles that doesn't make much sense. Don't get me wrong I understood what's going on and it didn't resonate. There was nothing serious/deep to me here as some of his other works. Not the story anyway. Characters were nonsense, especially the villain. Visually good, sufficient acting."
1541,"Straightforward review:Plot: Feels forced, cliche'd and had me facepalming in embarassment at several moments. Badly written villain, tired subplot of a damsel in distress. Its also not as complicated as I was led to believe, it's pretty straightforward actually. I saw comparisons to Primer, which in my opinion is a much better time-travel tale. This feels more like a James Bond movie with a time-travel element added to it.Effects are done well, technically the movie is very well made. But it feels a bit over the top, almost Michael Bay-like at times.Acting ranges from excellent to okay, the script doesn't help in this case but the actors do a good job considering. Pattinson is the standout for me.All in all its not a bad movie to waste some time on, it's interesting enough to keep you engaged (was struggling to finish the last 30mins myself though). As far as mainstream blockbusters go it's decent."
1542,"Other people have said this already, but I feel like this film leaves a lot of questions to be asked. I'm okay with a sci-fi films as long as we get what the film is trying to get across. But...I feel like the film throws too much at you too quickly off the bat, then spends so much time trying to explain what is going on but not actually achieving anything-ish... I just couldn't follow what was going on.It's a classic film to watch repeatedly on streaming services or physical copy. You will most likely leave the theatres confused if you watch this expecting to be given the answers to the holes you find along the way.Avg. 7.8/10 at the time of this review, does that mean it actually has a 8.7 rating?"
1543,"Damn, the movie is one of those that you must pay close attention to everything being said (and done) but that proves to be absolutely impossible to do, as all the additional audio tends to drown out the actual dialog. The audio for special effects, background audio, music for intros and outros, soundtrack etc seem to have some sort of bass distortion! Will watch again one of the days."
1544,The most confusing thing is the inverted own oxygen thing to me
1545,Confusing totally confusing. Too many people walking backwards too much of the time. I would go and see it again to see if it made more sense the second time around but I don't think l could bear sitting through it again. A disappointing film from a respected filmmaker.
1546,"He knew about the horrible audio, so he doesn't get a pass. It's purely unacceptable. As a filmmaker myself, I can guarantee you Nolan watched Tenet (or parts) on several different test mediums: phone, laptop, car, home tv, movie theater, IMAX, etc.Next Nolan movie... I'm skipping the theater experience, which is the exact opposite of what he is allegedly trying to do."
1547,"I have read all the reviews, good and bad, before going to see this movie, and it was unexpectedly good and entertaining, especially oi you understand some physics in general. I loved the music, it did not feel loud, it complimented the action completely and perfectly. I found Robert Pattinson's performance better than the rest of the cast and the best of his career.
I recommend the movie, i found it better than Interstellar, it's even rewatchable, even if you understand the plot firsthand."
1548,Tenet Movie is really a masterpiece and has an original script.The movie is quite interesting and does not make you bored until the end.The Director Christopher Nolan has given everything to this movie with rich ideas and very big creativity which only in the Inception movie we were watching so good work in such movies.The chemistry between John David Washington and Robert Pattinson was perfect and their performance was very good.if we could say a few words to arouse your interest to watch the movie Tenet is absolute masterpiece.If the movie is missing somewhere I think it is only in the sound mixing and nowhere else.
1549,"Oh boy was it good to get out to the theatree in Chicago (Davis). My rating of 5 is descriptive of my overall theatree going experience, and would have been higher if I saw the movie at home.I went in totally blind and think that it will be better if you go blind too, so I won't give any details about the movie - no spoilers.The GOODS:storyactingcharacterscinematographynew movie concept (I think), or at least the presentation was ground breaking to me.the lead actress is a hottie! HAWT.The BADSThe sound was terrible, and I don't think it was just the theatree, as I heard (out there) others also critical of the sound. Much of the dialogue was drowned out, but the kicker was that some of the dialect was also difficult to understand - combined, I missed about 1/20 of the dialogue in the movie. They could have had subtitles....it's like they didn't even watch the movie after they made it. Sound Stars: 2/10Not rated R. Should have been rated R. This is an adult movie for adults. There could have been at least a little sexual tension between the leads. So it was really a soft PG-13. Very few childrens under the age of 17 would understand it anyway.Too (Unnecessarily) Long. 2 1/2 hours??? Cut out 45 minutes. I knew it was going to be that long, and after 2 hours I said to myself, ""WRAP IT UP."" It would have been a much more enjoyable experience if I watched it from home (with subtitles).Over presentation of confusing action sequences. Yes, the effects were great and the action was good, however, towards the end, I was just confused...my brain shut down, and I just said, ""Is it over?""Way too much confusing information / too complex. I wouldn't say I'm ADD - shoot I focus for a living -, but 2 1/2 hours of blindsidingly fast information delivery is...???...it's just takes away from the overall entertainment of the movie.I think I would liken the movie to a modern Octopussy or View to a Kill (both JB).So the movie was good, really good, but there was a lot wrong with it too.(going to the movie theatree is fun!!!)"
1550,"I love the settings, visual effects, characters, and how director wants us to think about the plot. However, as a perfectionist, some plots are just not practically feasible. It is hard to explain how it happened in the way it showed. Perhaps there are some explanations but so far I searched through the internet and there is still no one can answer the questions."
1551,It seems that the exploration of the concept of time is one of Christopher Nolans primary obsessions. Weve already seen him play with it multiple times.In his latest movie Nola has created a complicated script and backed it with a solid 200 million dollar budget. While the visuals are indeed great at times the complexity of the story seems too self serving.A lot of people are complaining about the bad sound mixing and at times it is truly difficult to understand some of the lines. Despite that Tenet is still an enjoyable film and will certainly be enjoyed by the fans of the action and and thriller genre. While not Nolans best film it still succeeds at most of what it tries to do.
1552,"Many reviews here suggest you watch it twice to enjoy it but I personally found it awesome in just the one viewing(though I am looking forward to watching it a second time). It most likely helped that I was already fascinated by the concept of time to begin with and therefor might've understood parts of it better.
The movie is a bit complicated for sure, there are moments in the movie you won't understand until later, which I personally liked.
The acting was superb, both Robert Pattinson and John David Washington did a great job on it and so did the other actors, not much more to say.
One thing I particularly liked were the small details, like how they played with the soundtrack during certain parts(don't want to spoil).The one and only complaint I have, which I really hope is fixed in the blu-ray version, is the sound, which is the reason I didn't give the movie a 10.
I'm not talking about the soundtrack, which was great, but the volume of it. It was way way too loud so it was hard to hear what they were saying half the time and at my cinema the bass was so loud that it ""cracked"" frequently and made the whole room vibrate.
Luckily, I live in a foreign country and had subtitles which I generally don't read during english speaking movies but in this case was a necessity.
The issues with the sound is also the reason I won't watch the movie at the cinema a 2nd time but instead wait for it to be released on blu-ray or streaming.I highly recommend seeing it if you're looking for an intelligent movie with a heavy sci-fi theme that makes you focus.
But if you're looking for a brainless action movie or just have a low attention span then this movie might not be for you as it can be a bit confusing at time."
1553,"Ken Russell, anyone?(i.e., reminds me to Russell's later films, in which he allowed style to overwhelm story and character and plot)"
1554,"On my first viewing of Tenet, I really enjoyed it but I left very confused, overwhelmed, and not fully knowing how to feel. I got the gist of the story but the mechanics of how things were accomplished left me baffled. I already knew I would want to see this multiple times, and after a second viewing I must say I love this film and I think it's fantastic! From a technical standpoint, the movie is near flawless. The cinematography is gorgeous, the score is fantastic (I love how Ludwig incorporates a hip-hop-esque beat at times), and the editing is very well done. I loved the acting all around; everyone gives a great performance. I didn't get some of the inversion elements at first, but the more times you watch the film the clearer it gets. The second half of the film is bonkers and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. I've heard many critics say this film is devoid of emotion, and I have to disagree. While not as emotionally resonant as films like Inception and Interstellar, I actually found myself really emotionally affected on second watch. I really bought the commradery of Washington and Pattinson despite most of their friendship being offscreen. The way these actors convey such friendship despite the protagonist not experiencing it yet is phenomenal, and I even teared up at the end when Neil reveals their long friendship before going to sacrifice himself.Despite loving this film, I can't give it a 10/10 right now for a few reasons. For starters, some exposition scenes in the beginning, while necessary, feel really clunky at times. Also, I agree with most that the sound mixing makes it hard to hear dialogue at times, though I didn't find it as bad on my second viewing and I don't think it'll be a problem on the blu-ray. I'd say my biggest issue with the film right now is that while I think the second half is absolutely phenomenal, I just wasn't as into the first half. There are parts in the first half I love (plane crash, inverted fight, kitchen fight) and I was still engaged, but I just wasn't feeling the first half the way I was feeling the second half.Overall, I think Tenet is a really great film that can be enjoyed as a cerebral puzzle or just outright spectacle. I think this film gets better and better the more you watch it and I have a feeling that years from now it will be looked at much more positively than it is now (similar to The Prestige). While it's not my favorite of Nolan's filmography (not yet at least), I absolutely recommend this and I can't wait to see it many more times in the future."
1555,"""Hasn't happened yet"". Yeah it has. 2020's Tenet has finally hit movie theaters. Time to 'Mask Up', keep six feet, and avoid sitting next to seat-filling strangers.So OK, you got a wooden John David Washington (Denzel's son) in the lead. You got miscued sound editing that's only hindered by a bludgeoning soundtrack. You got a 150-minute running time that flows at a somewhat decent clip. Finally, you got the obligatory Michael Caine cameo that always plays opposite the main persona. Yeah Tenet is the flick that director Christopher Nolan was probably born to make. The question is, were we born to see it?Anyway, Tenet is an out of the box, scrambled spy thriller that might require multiple viewings. And that's even if you didn't enjoy it. Nolan working from his own clunky script, fashions his altered version of Back to the Future Part II except that everyone is occasionally walking and talking backwards.Action-packed yet overly mysterious and lacking in character background within the first hour, Tenet is Nolan at his most ambitious and/or most opaque. Too bad his storytelling sensibilities can't coincide with well, his stark ambition.As something about a secret agent who has to steal a case of plutonium which would adhere to the start of World War III, Tenet is an enigma wrapped inside a coffer wrapped inside a gimmickry bubble. The film is a human Zapruder because you have to rewind scenes in your head just to figure out what the heck is going on (hence the multiple viewings).Christopher Nolan as a helmer, isn't in the business of entertaining you. He wants to educate you, like an MIT professor who's bent on getting a darn Field's Medal. It's his world, his rules, and we're just sitting in the middle while sucking on it for $10 bucks a pop. I'm going with a rating of 2 and a half stars until I see Tenet again, ""tentatively""."
1556,"Tenet is one of those ideas that sound cool but don't work in practice. The whole premise of some objects and some people travelling in reverse to our time simply doesn't work. What appears is that Nolan struggled to put that on screen and make it clear.
Somebody once said ""if you can't explain things simply you don't understand them fully"". This is what happened. And if you have to watch a movie more than once to understand it then the movie failed on it's most basic aspects: communication."
1557,"With the Covid-19 pandemic killing off the cinema for the foreseeable future, a bunch of Hollywood executives got together and asked Nolan: Can you put the final nail in the coffin?Firstly, they loved the soundtrack so much that they made it louder than the dialogue so you can't understand key plot points. Secondly, it makes absolutely no sense. To give an analogy, they took an Inception level complicated story and then played it out like Memento but jumping back and forth playing things forwards and backwards then splicing other parts in when you least expect so you have no idea what's going on anymore and have no way to follow what's happening. The acting is monotonic and scripted.The soundtrack (8/10), cinematography (9/10) and special effects (9/10) are excellent, but without a comprehensible story and plot flow (0/10) it gets a final score of 0 out of 10. 0 times anything is still 0. Maybe it gets better with a second watch and understanding. However I won't be going back to risk Covid at the cinema for a second viewing."
1558,"Just got home from watching Tenet. Without giving too much away, there is a German Netflix series called Dark, that shares some similarities to this film. One cannot fathom writing such a complex tale, and then conceptualise it on Film. Dark just barely wraps up all the storylines and character arcs in its 3 serie/season run.To think someone could encapsulate such an ambitious 26 episode series into one film is beyond incredible! Christopher Nolan does it in 2 hours and 30 minutes! He is a visual storyteller for the ages. His pacing and storytelling style rival Hitchcock, Kurosawa, Fellini and Godard.There are certain plot holes, and dues ex machinas to be sure. However Mr. Nolan does not give the audience a chance to ponder as he carries you through the narrative with the speed of an M60 machine being emptied by a screaming John Rambo! RaaaaaaAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!! But I digress, Mr. Nolan carries you through the narrative without any obligatory or extemporaneous cues to the audience that lesser formulaic films always do by the mandate of the Hollywood Executives.Given the gravitas of his film portfolio, He now has the power and freedom to tell stories the way he wants to, without the influence of the Hollywood system, that demands films to be dumbed down to movies with a healthy dose of forced romance, and bad CGI prescribed to the general populace.In my humble opinion, it's as if Christopher Nolan is literally telling the audience. YOU ARE SMART! FIGURE IT OUT! And I F**KING LOVE IT!!I'm quite chuffed an Englishman is creating such an original voice in cinema, without flashy gimmicks, or unnecessary eye candy to ensnare the audience's attention.
One could argue his high concept special FX are gimmicky. Consider that any FX used in his films always serve a purpose, to drive the story forward in stead of detract or distract from it.Anywho, as you can tell, I loved this film! There was a few people that walked out of the theatre half way. I can understand how the musical score and intensity of some scenes may be too much and too difficult to follow and absorb. However if you enjoy films that challenge you, and allow you to put the pieces together just as the main protagonist does. Then you will love this film.On a side note: John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, and Kenneth Branagh's performances were outstanding! John comes into his own out of the shadow of his famous father. However I did see that Denzel swagger and cadence in some scenes that are simply genetic. I am thoroughly impressed by Robert Patttinson, with his previous film The Lighthouse. He truly a gifted young actor. I'm looking forward to his turn as Bruce Wayne. I wish him a speedy recovery,."
1559,"Christopher Nolan has solidified his legacy. This is such a great, mind-blowing, jaw dropping action film. This film can be a little bit confusing, especially in the first hour or so, however, if you just relax and take it all in, the film will end up explaining little moments that will come back in glorious fashion.The acting in this movie is EXCELLENT. John David Washington is so great in this film and his fight scenes will be in my mind forever. There is one fight scene in a hallway that is more mind blowing than the hallway fight scene in Nolans previous film Inception.The inversion aspect of this film definitely plays a large role and is so fascinating to watch in these amazing, nail biting action sequences.This is, in my opinion, probably the most insane action film I have ever seen.I'm rating this 10/10 stars. This is such a great film. I HIGHLY recommend seeing this at an IMAX theater like I did."
1560,"The Movie is full package for movie enthusiast like movie, It has complex story, great action and story line.For the first half of the movie you will be banging your head against the wall, as none of it will be making any sense, due to the complex nature of the movie. During the second half it will all start to come together and things will start falling into the place. Make sure you are giving concentration to the movie. If you are distracted during the movie, I am pretty sure you will miss some amazing parts.The character ""Andrei Sator"" has some kind of accent which makes it difficult to understand some of his dialogs. May be watch this movie with a subtitles to better understand them.Over All this was a 9/10 experience for me."
1561,"I'll watch anything Nolan writes and directs but Tenet is nowhere near the beautiful storytelling of Inception or Interstellar. I felt no emotion other than impatience watching Tenet. It's a cold film with spartan set design and little time for character. It's all action or expository dialogue. While I felt disappointed, I also appreciate the world building Nolan did in Tenet. I'm a sci-fi afficiondo but I felt cheated I didn't get enough of Tenet technology.Some pros and cons ...
Pros: Pattinson is always cool and has charisma and Debicki is like a new Vanessa Redgrave - she has presence. I like her as a strong woman as in The Man From Uncle vs a femme fatale. I felt somewhat connected to these two characters in Tenet.Cons: soundtrack was WAY too loud as to render dialogue inaudible. What good is that if you make film and people can't hear the dialogue? I actually felt ripped off. My son had to insert ear plugs. I'm not sure what experience Nolan is trying to induce with this type of sound mixing..?Not enuf Sci-fi technology: The audience learns things along with the Protagonist played by John Washington. Tenet organization recruits him from the CIA to get close to a Russian oligarch, Sator to stop him using Tenet technology to end the world. He recruits Pattinson's character Neils to assist and then befriends Sator's estranged wife. She sold a forged painting to Sator who is using that to control her contact with their son. Our Protagonist & Neils steals the painting from storage to free her from Sator's grip.As the story progresses, we learn pairs of turnstiles enable people and objects to entropy themselves in time travel, either to invert (go backward) through a previous time, thus necessitating a gas mask or, to enter another turnstile to be able to move forwards in a previous time. The film spends very little time explaining this technology. There's a scene about inverted bullets (which are sent from the future & sold on the black market). There's hints in a few scenes that people and objects are moving backwards. But we don't see the actual turnstiles well until an hour into the film. And even then it's through quick action sequences so you're like oh but! oh but! Eh it's past.Plot: The film ends with a glorious action sequence where military from the Tenet org assist our Protag & Neils in stealing 9 pieces that form an algorithm from Sator, who plans to end the world because he has cancer. Apparently the future is bleak due to climate change and they communicate with Sator he should end the world. Does this strike anyone other than me as a seriously flawed plot line? We have a virtually invisible antagonist character in the future using a Russian oligarch to end the world. I'm shocked Nolan went that way."
1562,"Whilst Tenet is obviously a visually spectacular film, it lacks narrative and character development. Large amounts of exposition and inaudible dialogue means the film is utterly incomprehensible. A lack of character development means you couldn't care less about the supposed plot. Nolan's worst film to date."
1563,"It looks like a ""classic"" Nolan movie so that opinion is not totally wrong. Nolan is fond of science-fiction and he is brave enough to try radical things about that. You can feel the self-confidence of Nolan in the movie. So ""Tenet"" includes a superior idea about time and inverting it. I really appreciate the idea but it isn't simplified so some of audience can find it too complex. Older ones, Inception, Interstellar vb. were more clear. Anyway, the end of story made it a bit more understandable.Nolan doesn't want us to interest with characters' background. This is Nolan's manner. Thats why we can't judge them. We don't know who is Andrei or his motivation totally. The Protagonist, John David Washington made a good job. Nolan's preference was right. Neil, Robert Pattinson made a good job too. Actually the best in the movie. So, acting is excellent of both.Music was very dynamic, fits in action; like before Zimmer did. Cinematography is also nice, Hoyte van Hoytema used to work with Nolan, great duo.Last of all, it is a nice movie to watch in cinema and enjoy action but by comparison with his older jobs this is an average work. Nolan has started to repeat himself."
1564,"Hated this.........only good thing was having the whole cinema screen to myself lol. Prepare for a rant lol.Tenet's concept is so self indulgent, I can just picture Nolan in the editing suite hitting rewind on certain scenes and saying ""There I did it i'm a genius, Oscars for me I made characters go backwards I'm such an original"" it's so protentious and every character insists in speaking in riddles or being VERY BRITISH. How Nolan made three Batman films and never used the riddler I'll never understand.You won't care about a single character and the lead doesn't even get a name I'm guessing it's not important, but look bullets go backwards ""ohhhh ahhh"".The screenplay is awful. The sound and music are poorly done, half the time the music drowned out the dialogue and I hadn't a clue about what was going on.Kenneth Branagh I love the guy, but this isn't James Bond dial in the 20 minute dialogue of ""you'll never get away with this"" and ease up on the stereotypical European villain voice errghhh.Also one lead female character and she spends the movie being put to sleep when she asks too many questions or she's playing the damsel in distress and of course uses her sexuality to fool the baddies......errghhhhh Elizabeth Debicki deserves better!!!Anywho yeah I hated it, kill it with fire lol."
1565,Loved the film but in IMAX it was far to loud not necessary. The plot was good a bit confusing but a typical CN film leaving you to discuss in detail and maybe watch again. The set pieces were visually incredible and plentiful.
1566,"Don't try to understand it. Feel it.That is probably the best advice I can give you when you go see Tenet. It is without a doubt the most complex film that I have seen. A new standard has been set for mentally challenging movies ; Inception feels easy to understand in comparison. I would even say that it is too complex for its own good, as its relentless pacing and heavy exposition scenes take away some of the enjoyment from the film.The visual spectacle on display is unlike anything we have ever seen : characters moving forward in time inside set pieces that move backwards, hand-to-hand combat against inverted enemies and buildings with one half blowing up and one half reconstructing are just some of the things that blew me away. As usual, Nolan uses practical effects that make for an unforgettable experience, especially when witnessed on a giant IMAX screen. The stunt work is top notch, the cinematography is spectacular, and on top of that all of the acting is very good.This is a difficult movie to rate, because I feel like I only understood 60% of the story. It is one that I will be rewatching on blu-ray when it comes out, and as I start to crack this puzzle, my rating might go up, or down. But for now, while the story wasn't as satisfying as I would have liked, I would be lying if I said that I didn't have a great time. It isn't Nolan's best work, but it's still very much worth watching..edolpxe ot tuoba si dnim ym ekil leef I woN"
1567,Tenet is the new Inception. Astonishing masterpiece.
1568,"As a person who loves complicated and mind twisting movies, I have to say this wasn't fun to watch at all, the plot is so complicated it's just retarded and makes no sense. It became so boring at one point that you just wish it ended already. And the dialogues... not a single funny or digressed, not-plot-related sentence and everybody is talking so fast with no breaks in between. The music and sound effects are terrible and dark and go on for an entire movie, even during the dialogues.The worst Nolan movie so far in my opinion."
1569,This happens when the industry makes too many sound editors furlough! I left the cinema before the move ended as I was worried about my hearing (warning this health and safety hazard!). Plot would be ok for 4 if you could understand what they were mumbling in between horrific explosions of sound effects. I advise anyone who goes to see it have a page explaining the plot on your phone handy
1570,"Sooooooo disappointing. The first word out of my mouth when the credits rolled was ""What?""Overly complicated plot that doesn't tie together at all. What was the drawing about? Why did we crash the jumbo jet? Why the gold bars? Who exactly is this main character supposed to be? Oh, right. ""The Protagonist"". He has no name. So cool (sarcasm).The music was awful. Characters had no depth. Dialogue didn't cut it. More than anything it was dreadfully confusing.Nearly 2.5 hours long yet I have NO IDEA what this movie was supposed to be about. I should have walked out. This movie left me frustrated and angry. Christopher Nolan owes us all our money back."
1571,"That's enough to be said. Christopher Nolan's mind said to himself all time travel movies make no sense so I will make the most nonsensical time travel movie ever!
Nolan has so many idiots convinced that he is the smartest man ever. These are the Nolanites."
1572,"I've seen thousands of movies. Some great. Some not so great but nothing is as flawed as Tenet. It's a shallow, empty, narcissist piece of film making with blatant disregard for those who are giving up 150 minutes of their time to see it. What makes matters worse is that Nolan's last movie, Dunkirk was a masterpiece.Clearly I'm foolish as I had no idea what was going on throughout. I'm also not sure I'm supposed to. Call me old fashioned but I like a movie with either some semblance of plot or characterisation. There's no empathy here. You will not care about anyone or anything on screen.Then there's the sound. I watched this in imax. The music shook the speakers to the point where they were trembling. But could I hear anything the actors were saying? Of course not. They were buried beneath an avalanche of noise. Great swathes of dialogue remain unheard.As the movie lurches towards its third and abysmal final act and you're forced to watch a third rate version of call on duty intercut with a woman pouring suntan lotion on someone's back, you begin to wish that you could move backwards in time and claim back those 150 minutes of time that you've wasted watching this dross.In a time when we deserve great escapist entertainment, Tenet is a travesty. Clearly Nolan is at a point in his career when he's surrounded by 'yes men' as no one had the balls to tell him that Tenet is an absolute disaster."
1573,"2 1/2 hours of pure garbage. Denzel Washington Jr. cannot act! Dialogue throughout the film, gas mask, et al was unintelligible. Watching fight sequences both forward and backwards was unbearable! Where do I get my 2 1/2 hours back!!!"
1574,"Excellent film! Nolan proves he is the best thing since Kubrick, yet again. The ways he utilises the camera to the excellent story, amazing."
1575,"The supposed explanations of the sci fi bits are quickly mumbled out, and in bits at a time.I've watched it twice now, the second time with closed caption, and it still doesn't make any sense. As a sci fi aficionado, I do enjoy cerebral provocative ideas, but this one takes too much work to understand.I gave it a 5/10 because it does give a visual action rush."
1576,"Love sci-fi but this just doesn't make any sense. The film writers seem to have started out with a good story, stuck to the premise for a while and then got lost in the steaming dung pile they created and said, let's just finish it and hope nobody catches on to the fact we got lost in our own story! Don't waste your time. Acting was great apart from the lead man who I say was used because he is black and not because of his skills on screen. Can we just hire actors based on acting rather than trying to keep the snowflakes happy?"
1577,"Anyone have a copy of ""Tenet for Dummies"" 2020?
I bet Youtube probably has.I did get the basic gist of this time travel sci-fi thriller but really did have a difficult time understanding the nuances of ideas in it. I am not even sure I want to work hard for it.Anyway, the special effects are pretty good and so are the acting performances. But until I watch this film again, I don't feel comfortable giving it a star rating."
1578,John David Washington is a great actor. Elizabeth Debicki should be more famous. It's nice to see Robert Pattinson back in mainstream movies. The plot is very confusing and I literally did not care for this film. Nicely shot though.
1579,"A generic time-travel movie with less layers than usual. The gimmick of the real-time traveling instead of the instant transition of other movies is used in just one short scene and a half. So that makes it less USP-scenes than already sparse Inception had. Because we get barely three ""timelines"" and a most of the traveling they did hide without interacting with the plot. Yes, just like Primer, but without all their plans going to the dogs in the last part.The simplistic story is more or less okay, but the plot is really weak and that drags down the characters too. We have an irrational cowboy Commando-like protagonist in a movie about a very tight spec-ops operation, where everything goes according to plan. The intro is slurred, the viewer never knows the amount of autoritah or clearance the protagonist has. Despite being a spec-ops guy with gorilla warfare he never even for a second questions why everyone supports his idiotic cowboy ideas which threaten the whole fate of the world just because of one stupid girl. Therefore the whole lore and setting are garbage.And this film answers my old question. Yes. When Nolan doesn't put his primitive movies into a blender, and instead tells them in a straight order they show just how much primitive and not polished they are."
1580,"180 minutes of torturous, backwards, time travel hokum that Nolan wants us to watch another couple of times to fully get. Well that's the spoiler free plot dealt with. If you watched the 1997 BBC crime time travel drama ""Crime Traveller"" you know what to expect.
I'm a fan of Nolan and enjoy his work, but I think I'll file this under curio.
The cast? Well Kenneth Branagh hams it up as himself, but in angry mode while putting on an accent. Michael Caine plays just plays himself, without bothering with an accent.
For someone who's never watched ""Twilight"" I thought Robert Pattinson came across as the most likeable character.
The biggest disappointment was our Protagonist, John David Washington, with his cardboard cutout performance. An indestructible, humorless superman. Like James Bond but with literally no personality.
It's watchable once, but I personally wont be watching it again like Nolan wants us to, I got all I needed from one viewing."
1581,"Tenet is by far the most Strange and weird movie of Chris Nolan , it's not his best and it's not his worst , it's something completely new...Tenet is so complex that even Nolan doesn't try to explain it , and explain what's happening (he tries at some moments but the scenes fail) , if I didn't knew anything about physics and of course Entropy I wouldn't understand even a second in the movie , but luckily for me I had some knowledge of the concepts .This movie is not art by any means , it's something new , something fresh... if you don't know physic I am sorry but you will not get anything from this movie , this movie has no feeling and sense , but it has a point , and it's gorgeous , and very very bright...Don't make any mistakes Tenet is not like any other work of Nolan , it's the most complicated thing Nolan is ever done , but it's satisfying at the end (at least for me) .I can't defend this movie from art perspective , but from idea and concept it's 10/10 .Tenet is Blue , Tenet is Madness , Tenet is Dark , Tenet is Twisted...Tenet is Twilight... Tenet is not a beginning , Tenet is not a ending . Tenet exists because it wants to exist..."
1582,"Nolan continues to challenge our established notions of cinema, especially of linear storytelling and cause effect. Watching Tenet is like peeling an onion from the outside inwards, and from the inside outwards. Towards the end of the film you have some notion of meeting in the middle, but you know many viewings are needed to connect the roots and branches of this complex tree.As a visual storyteller Nolan continues to deliver, his set pieces and action sequences are adequate, though some moments seemed repeated from previous outings especially Dark Knight. Some vistas seemed like fillers lifted from random Bond films.The underlying technology of inversion was not adequately explained to a science buff like me, and seemed somewhat glossed over for convenience. The communication between present protagonists and future masters could also benefit from additional expansion. The abusive marriage in the center of the plot seemed a distraction and not conducive to the conclusion.The movie is a challenge to watch in trying to keep diametrically opposite timelines unified in the mind. There are several aha moments when you get the satisfaction of realizing or predicting what just happened, but long stretches of head scratching in between. Definitely cerebral cinema for formidable minds."
1583,I would say this movie is definitely not the best work of Nolan yet. The story has less of character developments and backgrounds to offer and rather a more complicated plot on forwards and backwards of the events which may not be as shocking when you find out what they are meant to be. It has failed to connect me on a more elevating emotional level. I would give it a 7.5/10.
1584,"Ok, we do know now that the new time traveling is called inversion. Does that solve the grandfather paradox? Of course not. But hey, we liked other movies with this problem as well. This one did not convince me. It was well produced: good images, sound and action, but the story was contrived and not plausible at all. What inspired Nolan to this movie is obviously the sator square:
SATOR
AREPO
TENET
OPERA
ROTAS
Yeah. Right. You can read this in every direction. And every word in this square has a place in the movie. And because I like word games and symbolism I leave it with an overall 6."
1585,"Most of the time I couldn't understand what people were saying, and the cuts between shots are so fast you've already missed another line of dialogue trying to figure out what the last one was.I hope it's fixed in the bluray release so I can watch it again and I will at least be able to turn on subtitles.It's a complex plot to follow, which is made next to impossible without understanding what the actors are saying.I must say that I'm a massive Nolan fan and this is exactly the kind of movie I'll come back to and watch over and over again, but in this case his writing and direction has been completely obliterated in the editing room by some talentless hack."
1586,"I enjoy films that make you think, but this is a mess.
Didn't enjoy it at all despite all the hype."
1587,Deserves a few stars for effort and some entertaining scenes but otherwise the plot unfolds incoherently; and most of the time you don't know why the characters are doing what they are doing. It tries for some intellectual cachet but the silly plot doesn't really support that.
1588,With such a massively convoluted plot why is the sound so bad that mumbling and incoherence add to an inability to follow the plot. Such a mind bender needs very careful explanation and this viewer simply didn't get that leaving me clueless as to what was happening and why. When you confuse the audience there is no chance of them appreciating the film and I don't think that thought ever occurred to the makers of Tenet. A shame really as I suspect that it could be turned into a really good film simply by allowing the audience to follow the plot.
1589,"Tenet is an action-thriller and spy-film written and directed by Christopher Nolan whom
had taken more than five years to write
the screenplay due to deliberating about Tenet's central ideas. Tenet was
produced by his wife Emma Thomas,
she has frequently collaborated
with him on numerous works such as
The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception,
Interstellar, The Prestige, and Dunkirk.The plot follows a secret agent portrayed
by John David Washington. The actor certainly has proven that he can anchor
as he provides a satisfying performance as a man who is determined to accomplish his objective by any means necessary. Talent must run in the family as he is the son of two-time Oscar winner Denzel Washington.
I am looking forward to viewing his other performances in the motion picture industry. Accompanying him onscreen are Robert Pattison and Elizabeth Debicki who provide charismatic performances as Neil
and Kat assisting him on his mission towards preventing a universal threat. Ludwig Göransson engulfs the film with a memorable and pulse-pounding score and Jackson Spidell's fight co-ordination is not only tense but engaging as we witness backward
and forward fight sequences.Tenet is one of the most intelligent films released this year. We are introduced to concepts forming the narrative's over-arching story such as backwards-moving entropy, non-linear thinking and temporal paradoxes.
As complicated as that may sound,
the script is polished wonderfully to where everything introduced falls cohesively into the film's closing act. I never could have imagined watching this film at home. I cannot
wait to view it a second time.The main negative that I can share
about the film is the dialogue is muddled in certain scenes due to the sound mixing.
I recommend subtitles for those
who plan to watch it on digital.Follow me on Instagram: @joshuarenealvarez"
1590,"WARNING : Be fully rested and very focused on details while seeing that movie!I sadly rated 5/10,
despite the story line ( a bit confusing ),
the movie itself was absolutely breathtaking,
great actors, breathtaking and amazing special effects.However, ""some details will have to be reworked"" such as:1) The starting was great at the National Opera,
howbeit, I had no clue what was going on...2) The Indian character appeared at the beginning with grey ish hair,
and during a further scene, she was blond...
Was she the same person, or perhaps, was she coming back from the past and redo her hair?The music was too loud mostly in all scenes.I could barely understand the curator's posh accent in some scenes( And I'm a Londoner ), cause the music on the background was so loud, I was trying to read her lips unsuccessfully, the actress didn't articulate properly.It such a real shame, I will not waste another 2hours 50 minutes re-watching that movie.Howbeit, I would like to recommend you to be fully rested and very focused during the screening of the film.Thank you for reading, hoping this review was helpful.
Good Wishes."
1591,Though I'm Still planning on wasting some five more hours of my life
1592,"The idea behind the plot is inspired. Not your average time travel plot at all, and the build up to the finale is well executed with lots of impressive action set-pieces along the way. Character development is minimal, however, and I'm still not sure what the nice Indian lady had to do with it all. But Edward Cullen does a decent job as a diffident toff, leaving lots of nice little R-Pats on his journey toward/back to self-sacrifice. My chief grumble is that the final battle seems confusing (who the hell is shooting back at the good guys?) and I'd have preferred to see the soldiers moving a bit faster (you know, as if they were actually being shot at). But all-in-all I enjoyed this film. The atmosphere and score is superb and if character development was overlooked it did at least allow for pace and plot. A solid 6.5/10."
1593,"I didn't find the usually inspiring ""actual"" vs ""CGI"" impact from Chris Nolan movies. The main actor's wardrobe wasn't.. Anything. And all n all, the soundtrack, the general flow of the film felt so much like the Inception."
1594,Major sound issues make it unwatchable and Nolan doesn't care.
1595,Audio-wise unintelligible exposition at key points in the plot sets you up for failure to grasp what's going on. Gripping and excellent action scenes on the other hand. Unsatisfying altogether.
1596,My first cinema experience since February due to Covid. What a disappointing return. Spent most of the movie trying to figure it out and even when some of it made sense I still didn't care about any of the characters and what the point of the whole thing was.
1597,"Like the only words spoken by Maurice Fischer, my main emotion after taking in Tenet was ""Disappoint"", and not because I was disappointed that I tried.This is a movie worth seeing, especially on the big screen, but it was frustrating for two main reasons:
1. Much of the critical dialogue you need to hear to at least half way understand what's going on was impossible to hear or understand, either because of heavy foreign accents, because of masks being worn, or because the dialogue was just overwhelmed by the noise of the action and the soundtrack.
2. The above is only a big problem because the plot is so dang confusing. At least half of the story line is really lost because you're still trying to figure out what happened in the last scene.I had high hopes for this film. Saw it in the pre-release. Paid extra to see it in the big XD theater, which I never do. But as a huge fan of Inception, I was super looking forward to the film. I even had silly hopes there might be some overt connection to Inception (didn't really expect it though). And honestly, it seems like Nolan made it confusing on purpose. Well, ok, maybe it's like avant-garde art where everyone looks a blob of paint and pretends how amazing it is, but I can't do it.As I said at the beginning, it's worth seeing, just because it is still an ""event"", and I'm sure I'll see it again on the small screen to see if I can make more sense of it all, but just go into it with your expectations in check."
1598,"I was really excited to see 'Tenet', as Christopher Nolan is one of my favourite directors of all time. In my opinion, he has not made a single bad movie and I enjoy all of his movies he made so far. As such, I was really looking forward to watching 'Tenet'. So how was it then. Well, I enjoyed it, but I've some major issues with it.Let's start with the good first. This movie looks and sounds fantastic. It is well shot and the score to it is fantastic. The action sequences are also fantastic. It is well choreographed, and very little CGI is used. The cast also gives good performances and they have great chemistry with one another on-screen. And it is also nice for Nolan to cast Indians and an African-American as the lead. There are also a lot of interesting ideas presented in this movie.Now with the bad. The pacing of the first half of the movie felt really off to me. Characters will be at one location at one scene and will be at a completely different location during the next scene. There is also a lack of development in some scenes as well. The sound mixing is really bad in this movie. The dialogue often gets drowned out by the score and the sound effects. As such, I could not hear a lot of dialogue in this movie. This is especially problematic as characters are constantly spilling expositions. Thus, I was rather uninvested in many scenes as I have no idea what is going on. Besides that, most of the characters also feel really hollow and one-dimensional, with the exception of Kenneth Branagh's character and Elizabeth Debicki's character. They are mostly there just to move the plot or to spill exposition. Even John David Washington's character, who is only referred to as 'The Protagonist', does not have much character development. There are also many things in the plot that does not make sense.Ultimately, I enjoyed watching 'Tenet', but there are also many problems with it. If I were to rank it among Christopher Nolan other movies, I will only put it above 'Following' and below everything else he has made. I do recommend seeing it, but not in the cinema now due to the COVID-19 pandemic."
1599,"I've been a big fan of Christopher Nolan, especially with his superb efforts like The Dark Knight, Inception and Interstellar. And I've been looking forward to this for almost a year. But my first theater experience since Covid was something of a disappointment due to both conceptual and technical problems that interfered with presenting a coherent story. From the opening sequence in the concert hall (which they never really explain), to problems with understanding the dialogue due to voices being muffled/distorted by gas masks and competing ambient noise, not to mention accents and diction, is a recurring problem throughout the film. Things might be better with headphones, but I suspect not much.The other major problem is how it deals with the idea of time travel or reversal of time. They talk about the grandfather paradox, where someone goes back in time and kills their grandfather, but they never declare how that might be resolved. I think, if the movie accomplishes anything, it shows that such time travel would result in rationally unresolvable chaos-which I guess you could say, the movie portrays pretty will, and perhaps even disproves. Yes, observational travel back in time may well be possible, where all you can do is watch, like replaying a video. But interactive time travel in our 4-D universe is apparently not possible. Taking the grandfather paradox to it's extreme, someone from 10 billion years in the future could figure how to go back in time and cancel the Big Bang....(sigh).It's a stellar cast, with Elizabeth Debicki being a dominant presence in every scene she's in; and Denzel Washington's son, John David, is excellent, especially given that he has the best diction of the lot-something I probably wouldn't normally have noticed.As for plot questions: I never understood the significance of Plutonium 241, or what exactly the role of the woman from India was, except that she was the antagonist to Washington's protagonist.On the positive side, the visuals were as excellent as the audio was garbled. Some of the action sequences worked despite the time-vector confusion, and the scenes with the hydrofoil sailboats was a visual highlight of the film. I regret that I can only give this a 6/10."
1600,"First of all: No spoilers!Christopher Nolan is one of the few remaining directors who make independent, original films with little CGI and thus attract masses of viewers to the cinema. I'm no exception either. Nolan could show me a two-minute trailer from a simple meadow and I would run to the cinema! Now it is the case that his latest film ""Tenet"" from 2020 is more than just a new, spectacular action film: Since march the corona virus has influenced everything in the world, including cinemas of course. Release dates have been delayed and especially the big movies like ""Black Widow"" and ""Tenet"" are in great demand. Now Nolan and Warner Bros. decided to reopen the world of cinema with one of the most anticipated blockbusters of the year.
As expected, I was very interested in this work, so far I have really enjoyed all of Nolan's films and have been entertained and touched by these in a special way. Unfortunately, ""Tenet"" is something ""special"" in this respect: I left the cinema disappointed and confused. On the one hand, ""Tenet"" is certainly one of the most impressive films of the last few years, but the rest left me pretty perplexed and empty ...A CIA agent gets a very strange job called ""Tenet"". He learns that there are so-called ""inverted"" objects that move back in time. He is supposed to get to the bottom of the matter and quickly realizes that the whole thing is bigger than initially assumed ...I don't want to reveal much more, because the story is mostly a secret and that's always a good thing in my opinion. And to say it straight away: ""Tenet"" is one of those films that will polarize a lot. Some will love it and celebrate it as a masterpiece, others will shake their heads confused. Unfortunately I belong to the second group, although I have to admit that this film might get better with time (I know, pun!). At the moment I have to say that ""Tenet"" is Nolan's weakest film for me.Why is that? First of all, ""Tenet"" is without a doubt breathtaking from a technical standpoint. Nolan is notorious for using as little CGI as possible. For this he is valued and respected. And here, too, his talent shows when it comes to staging spectacular action. The mix of backwards and forwards running images is unique in its presentation. ""Tenet"" is without a doubt one of the most impressive films of the last few years and for me it definitely deserves an Oscar nomination for the cinematography (Hoyte van Hoytema was responsible for this, who has worked with Nolan since ""Interstellar"") or the set-design.
This time the score was not composed by Hans Zimmer, but by Ludwig Göransson, who already surprised me very positively with ""Black Panther"". However, his work is hardly inferior to that of Zimmer. Its soundtrack is impressive and has melodies running backwards over and over again, which fits perfectly into the concept of the film.In terms of sound, however, I have to criticize a few things: Not only is the music mixed very loudly, but above all the sound effects are in the foreground. Nolan has been doing this for many of his films, but it has never been as exhausting as it is here. Dialogues disappear in the noise and the performance in our cinema in particular was absolute horror! We had to cover our ears in the action scenes, that's ridiculous. But of course that could be more due to the cinema than to the film ...Let´s get to my main problem of the film: The empty and overly complex story. Nolan's brother Jonathan wrote the script for his movies up to ""Interstellar"". Since then, Christopher Nolan has been working alone in the scriptwriting business, and not always to his advantage. While ""Dunkirk"" was specially designed to work with just a few dialogues, ""Tenet"" almost exclusively relies on heavy-weight exposition chunks to explain the story. Unfortunately, Nolan hardly manages to get his ideas and concepts across to the audience. Here I also draw strong comparisons to his 2010 work ""Inception"". Nolan always has similar structures and tension arcs in his films, but for the first time I noticed that in a negative way. Although ""Tenet"" has different themes in the story, its structure is very similar to ""Inception"" (not to mention that Nolan has obviously been obsessed with the concept of time since ""Memento""). But where ""Inception"" had a very easy to follow plot despite the complex dream rules, ""Tenet"" gets lost mainly in uninteresting characters and confused attempts at explanation. Complex actions are not a point of criticism in my opinion, but you have to be able to follow them. So far, Nolan has always been very good at it, no matter how complicated the action was. With ""Tenet"" this doesn't seem to be the case anymore and I kept wondering what was happening. Especially the question of what which character actually wants was not answerable for me until halfway through the film! For me, that makes large parts of the film almost lengthy. It doesn't matter how spectacular the stunts are, I lack sympathy for the characters.The actors are not to blame because the cast is not only well chosen, but also talented. Despite his uninteresting character, John David Washington is convincing, as is Robert Pattinson. Perhaps above all of them, I liked Kenneth Branagh the most, especially the relationship with his wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki). For me, this was the most emotional part of the film and (above all) the best understood.Without spoiling something about the time travel elements: Nolan presents us these in a really unique way. Visually all of it looks great. Nevertheless, I strongly doubt that there are fewer time paradoxes here than in other films of this kind. Nonetheless, one notices that Nolan and his team have put a lot of meticulous work into planning the whole spectacle. The only problem is that it's hard to follow, especially in the finale ...Conclusion: From a technical point of view, ""Tenet"" is undoubtedly another milestone for Nolan, I have no doubts about that. The sound was exhausting and poorly mixed, but the visuals alone made the ideas of Nolan's film strong. If you look at the story, you will unfortunately not be convinced that directly. Maybe you have to watch the film several times, but maybe the execution is just poor. The dialogues and the script just have some flaws in my eyes. As huge as the action and the plot seem, at the end of the day ""Tenet"" sadly seems very limited in its possibilities for me ..."
1601,"""Tenet"" is a simple action thriller, that is not much fun due to its confusing narrative strands, and that does not achieve a greater sense of meaning by playing with the time-space continuum.On the morning of 26 October 2002, Russian special forces stormed Moscow's Dubrovka Theatre. Terrorists had taken 850 theatre-goers hostage two and a half days earlier. The special units had previously introduced a gas into the theatre, in order to eliminate the attackers. However, the gas probably also caused 125 hostages to die as a result of poisoning. This historical excursus also describes the first minutes of Christopher Nolan's ""Tenet"" in an opera house in Kiev. This does not yet have much to do with the main plot. The attentive viewer, however, already realises in these scenes that the conventional time-space structure does not apply in this film.Great hopes lie in ""Tenet"". It is the first big blockbuster to be released in cinemas since a longer time period. It is uncertain whether the 225 million dollars which the mega-project is said to have cost, can be regained despite the worldwide corona restrictions.Nevertheless, viewers should not hope to be brought back to the pre-corona era. ""Tenet"" fits surprisingly well into the present day: there is talk of ""lockdowns"". The characters sometimes wear gas masks, without which their lungs could not survive. There is a state of emergency.When Christopher Nolan releases a new film, about whose plot virtually nothing is known in advance, no more is generally expected than the big hit, which he has certainly achieved with films like ""Inception"" or""Memento"". But now at the latest it is clear: the magic has disappeared. ""Tenet"" does not come close to the previous works just described. Even if there are astonishing similarities to ""Inception"" and especially to ""Interstellar"", Christopher Nolan delivers nothing more than a simple action thriller.""Tenet"" could also have been made by Michael Bay. But sadly ""Tenet"" is so much less fun than, say, the last Bay film ""6 Underground"". In terms of content, however, both films are about saving the world from a powerful oligarch. And in doing so, ""Tenet"" waves ancient recipes: The evil, megalomaniacal and crazy oligarch is Russian. The heroes of the film embody the West. There is a cold war. They do not arm themselves with atomic bombs, but with other devices that could destroy life on earth in an instant. This narrative strand is paired with a pitiful woman who is trapped in the hands of her husband and fears for her child. She uses all means to get out of her predicament. She even accepts that the whole of humanity could be destroyed. Somehow strange!But the plot of ""Tenet"" cannot be described quite so simply. Nolan explains how the physical principles known to the average person are thrown off course. The physical entropy of objects is reversible in the future, so that they invert temporally. To explain it very simply: processes are reversed. This not only makes it possible to ""shoot bullets back"" into a gun. Rather, time can be reversed so that for inverted people, time runs backwards and the world also moves backwards. Nolan wants to make possible, what many people probably want at the moment: To go back to the good old days and to put the world in order where it got unhinged. Then maybe we wouldn't have to sit in the cinema wearing masks today.Anyone who tries to understand this new world order as a viewer is unlucky. I can already see how fans in internet forums are breaking the film down into its individual components and showing with dedication how logical and comprehensible all this is supposed to be. This time, however, the calculation will not work out. Too many contradictions come to light during the film. The film exposes itself when an entropy expert says to the so called protagonist, played by John David Washington: ""Don't try to understand it. Just feel it.""Already in ""Inception"" not everyone was enthusiastic about Nolan's ""Explanatory Cinema"", where the viewer is asked to make an effort to bring together the confusing narrative strands. Unlike ""Inception"" or ""Interstellar"", however, ""Tenet"" is far less astonishing. Everyone has probably seen a film running backwards at some point. The special effects in ""Tenet"" seem almost funny: People walking backwards, cars driving backwards and explosions running backwards. Sometimes you feel reminded of ""Matrix Reloaded"" from the year 2003.Time travel is nothing new either. Fortunately, the question of what happens when a person travelling back in time, kills his own grandfather has finally been answered: He will still exist, even if he would never have been born without his grandfather. This phenomenon will henceforth be called ""Grandfather Syndrome"". Too perplexed to understand, but somehow cool. However, the true exciting questions that could arise during time travel are only touched upon.""Tenet"" does not achieve the originality or depth that ""Inception"" had. Implanting a thought into a person's head through their dream world is a more subtle approach than using time travel to stop them from destroying the world by force and military means. As a result, disillusionment is more likely to set in when the confused strands of the plot cannot be brought together. Sometimes the film plays forwards, sometimes backwards, then forwards again and in the end everything is fine. The action is supported by the noisy film music by Ludwig Göransson, which could also be composed by Hans Zimmer.The characters in ""Tenet"" also pale in comparison to the performances of Leonardo DiCaprio or Marion Cotillard in ""Inception"". John David Washington and Kenneth Branagh fulfil all clichés of a hero and villain. It was by far not that simple in ""Inception"". Nevertheless, it is not quite clear who in ""Tenet"" is working with whom for what reasons and what the overall aim of the whole thing is.
Only Robert Pattinson brings in an interesting character. Unfortunately, the film is so busy pushing the plot forward and explaining that there is no room for interpersonal moments. The film simply does not care about its characters.In the end, the word ""Tenet"" describes the film very well: It is a so-called palindrome, that can be read forwards and backwards. It describes a dogma. But it remains unclear which dogma that is."
1602,"I checked some of the reviews before going to cinema and followed carefully the instructions given:
Background sounds and music are too loud so dialogues are not clearFirst half of the movie might is hard to grasp but things get more clear in the second halfSome people will not get itI was extra focused on dialogues and details which otherwise can easily be missed. Cinema being mostly empty due to Corona helped. The focus enabled me to catch most of the hidden parts and understand the movie, although I'm quite certain I will find more gems on the subsequent watches.The movie has one of the most complex stories I've seen. It has also very quick pace which doesn't give you enough time to digest what happened in the scene, before moving on to another scene.The acting is brilliant, as well as effects and of course the story, but this will never become a blockbuster like some other Nolan's movies did. Simply, because a lot of people will not understand it. And that's fine, I guess.So ignore all those reviews that give this movie low scores. These people did not understand the movie. If you are one of them, I can only say I'm sorry.I give it 9, because the sound mastering could have been better, especially at the beginning of the movie where it's really hard to distinguish dialogue from loud music. But I'm sure they'll fix this later, as they did with Interstellar."
1603,"I'm a huge Christopher Nolan fan and this is the first review I've ever left on IMDB. Went in with the mindset that ""I didn't need to understand it but just feel it"" which I had seen in the title of a review.Didn't realise it was an actual line in the movie during the first 2 hours and 15 minutes of exposition.What can I say about this movie! Stiff performances but I don't blame the actors given the dialogue they had to work with.Protaganist: they are sending back bullets from the....Neil: ""future! Which means""Cat: ""the reverse entropy of the future will mean..... but what about my son""Protaganist: ""get me tickets to Tallinn, I need 15 trucks, a car that is fast but doesn't look fast and a jumbo jet""Neil: smirk and nod sagelyAs for the complexity I don't mind films that are hard to understand or are up for interpretation. The lighthouse was an excellent movie and made no sense upon the first watch but it was compelling with excellent performances, real atmosphere, beautiful imagery and brilliant use of sound. It was bewildering but intoxicating.Tenet has none of this, at one point the dialogue seemed to almost become similar to the satire of inception (film I love) that South Park did.Didn't care about the characters. Performances were stiff and Pattison was the only one with any charisma and I think a lot of that was due to relativity!!!Had none of the incredible tension of Dunkirk. Really really disappointing and ultimately deadly dull.Very poor and don't be misled by the advert. One of the poorest films I've ever seen."
1604,It is a mind bending and mind blowing movie which you need to watch it couple of times to understand the story but all and all it's not the Inception or Interstellar.
1605,"Tenet was a movie that I was thoroughly looking forward to seeing, due to it being (what I thought at the time) a new twist on time travel. I could barely follow the movie though, and I'd say I am experienced when it comes to understanding dialogue and science. Half the time I could barely hear any character dialogue, the movie itself was hard to follow, the characters had no distinguishing traits or personality, and the explanation of the film's premise took up 80% of it. I keep seeing other reviews about how Tenet requires a second watch, but I'm sorry, for my first theatre viewing since the start of covid, it was a crap movie."
1606,"I have seen Tenet on IMAX as always I prefer to watch his movies on IMAX. I avoided spoilers before I watch the movie in this sense I'm lucky. Since I have seen the first trailer my hype increased. After I heard news about the movie like flowing of time backward , it worried and excited me at same time. After I have seen the movie 2 days ago, I feel I have seen good movie but not as good as Inception.
I really liked the action of the movie and tone of the was very satisfying, you nearly never get bored of the movie however its long runtime around 2 hours 30 minutes. Nolan's whatever is possible don't use CGI policy works in this movie too. They really crashed a real plane as you can see in the 2nd the trailer.(may be the in the last trailer). Ludwig Göransson did a good with soundtracks as you know Hans Zimmer was not in this movie as composer because of the scheduling conflicts. Nolan again uses complicated storytelling it is as ambitious as Inception but it was not as impressive as Inception. There some things I really haven't liked in the movie. In some scenes dialogues are cut short and sometimes can't be heard clearly because of the intensity of soundtrack. Going back time was very confusing and it also resembles parallel universes like in a film named ""Dejavu"" which is starring Denzel Washington. Whether coincidentally or not Denzel Washington's son John David Washington is the protagonist of the movie.
Future generation's role was ridiculous and they sent Tenet to destroy humanity. The villain's motivations are very ridiculous to help future generations. He is also very straightforward and cliche however Kenneth Branagh's performance is very good. I really didn't like godlike power of future generation and the villain simply it didn't work for me.Briefly, It is a solid action/sci-fi movie it sometimes is confusing but as a characters says ""If you don't try to understand and try to feel it"" it is a good movie. Although character development lacks in the movie performances of the cast was very good. Washington, Branagh, Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki gave good performances. It may not be a masterpiece but it is a damn good movie that you'll watch at least more than 2 times."
1607,"Time is relative. Relative to everyday life but also relative to Christopher Nolan's filmography; piecing together a fractured timeline in Memento, cheating time in the mindblowing Inception, bending time and travelling through wormholes in space in Interstellar, and the ticking clock as time ran out to save the stranded soldiers in Dunkirk. His latest, Tenet, forges a narrative based around time and the results really are quite something to behold.Armed with only one word, Tenet, the Protagonist (John David Washington) sets about on a mission to fight for the survival of the entire world. It's a journey of international espionage and a mission that will unfold in time, just not as we all know it.Tenet comes with a whole heap of expectations with the fact that it is the latest from Christopher Nolan but combine that with the notion that it will be the film a lot of people return to the cinema for since the Coronavirus pandemic shut them down earlier in the year, and it arrives with even more of a fanfare. Expect the unexpected from Nolan with every film he makes but with Tenet he takes it to new extremes because it really is next level stuff in terms of innovative filmmaking.Getting into the plot of Tenet too much would make my head spin more than it did when I was walking out of the cinema but I can say that once I had the time to walk away and really think about it, Nolan really has created a film that challenges its audience to really think about what they are watching. There's plenty of exposition throughout however, you still have to pay plenty of attention to the details or you could find yourself in limbo.It's another Nolan film that plays around with time but Tenet does so in a way that I don't think anyone would be able to say they've seen before. The action sequences are simply breathtaking, flowing both forwards and backwards in time, sometimes even at the same time. The ingenuity of it all is astounding and the idea of trying to choreograph fights and car chases backwards hurts my head enough yet alone actually executing it flawlessly, so there has to be a special mention to the stunt teams involved.Tenet is led by a magnetic performance from John David Washington, who is quickly becoming one of the most exciting screen presences around. His physicality in such a demanding role really shines through as does his undeniable charisma, giving his father Denzel a run for his money in that department. Robert Pattinson has forged an incredible career for himself after the Twilight series and as the blandly named Neil he brings a lot to a character who could just be seen as very throwaway, saving the heavy hitting for when we see him cracking skulls in The Batman next year.Elizabeth Debicki is the best of the supporting cast as Kat, trapped in a loveless marriage and held against her will by her villainous husband Andrei Sator, played by Kenneth Branagh, who thankfully doesn't ham it up as much as when he played the villain in Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is the man everyone forgot was in the film as a military commander and it's good to see Himesh Patel doing so well for himself after years of playing the nerdy Tamwar Masood in EastEnders.I didn't find myself taking to Ludwig Goransson's score so much throughout the film, obvious similarities to some of Hans Zimmer's work on previous Nolan films holding it back. The one major complaint I have with Tenet, and I feel it was always going to eventually happen in a Nolan film, was that there were a few moments where it was just too loud and dialogue was being drowned out by an incredibly uneven sound mix.That being said, Tenet marks a return to the cinema in quite triumphant fashion. It's big, loud and easily Nolan's most ambitious film to date, crescendoing to yet another emotional, if rather subtle this time round, finale that will make you sit back in your seat and feel like you've just had a cinematic experience like no other."
1608,"There are no words that can truly put this film into words, I can't stop thinking about what I just saw. Multiple viewings required, and that is why it's awesome."
1609,"Have you ever watched a masterpiece and not had the faintest idea of why it's a masterpiece? Like looking at the Mona Lisa, acknowledge it's one of the worlds most beautiful pieces of art, but not really knowing what all the fuss is about? This is where Tenet left me. I know it's brilliant, I can sense it's brilliant, I enjoyed my cinematic experience, but ask me what it was about and I don't know where to start! Never before have I left a film wondering if I stopped mid evolution from the apes. Like my brain developed only to the Neanderthal stage before watching Tenet in a past/present/future/past life and nearly imploding.I hope you've saved your post covid pennies ladies and gentleman because this film is going to require a hat trick of trips to your local theatre before you've even wrapped your head around the characters names and the term inversion.In closing, if you understand this film after your first sitting then you my friend belong on the first rocket ship out of here with Chris Nolan and Elon Musk, because you are not of this world!"
1610,"Intentionally confusing on the surface, but simple to understand once you take a breather from the needlessly inflated dialogue. The entire movie reminded me of academics who aim for superiority by using an excessive amount of jargon and a 'unique' structure, but in reality are just bad at presenting ideas to a learning audience. The movie isn't as smart as it thinks it is, and while it's certainly pretty, it's boring. Action and an interesting hook can only carry a narrative so far, and we're given no reason to care for the main cast beside their familiar faces and some weak 'family' connections that are never developed.Additionally, the 'epic' score is used excessively throughout, sometimes making it difficult to hear the actual dialogue. It's a real shame as I was looking forward to this movie.Side note: the only character name I can remember two hours after seeing the movie is 'Neil'. That's not a good sign."
1611,"The first genuine blockbuster since the COVID lockdown has arrived and I managed to catch one of the many preview screenings on Sunday night and quite frankly I departed in a state of astonishment.
It's yet another epic from visionary Director Christopher Nolan, who had been grappling with this concept for around ten years, before production began in 2019. There had been much secrecy surrounding his project, including a teaser trailer which gave a mere sprinkling of an espionage drama with some time manipulating twists. Tenet abounds with the unique styles of Nolan's filmmaking, especially with similarities to ""Inception"" and it's time bending concepts, plus ""Interstellar"" which was driven by its loud and dominant soundtrack and also ""Dunkirk"" which leapt straight into action, without any character development.
It starts off and progresses very much like a Bond spy film, with an unnamed CIA operative known as The Protagonist (BlacKkKlansman's David John Washington), recruited by a mysterious organisation called Tenet, after he impressively thwarted a Ukrainian terrorist kidnapping plot. (Mind you this was filmed on a grand scale with a massive crowd of extras). But the mission now at hand, is to prevent the rich and wealthy renegade Russian Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh) from starting WWIII, by not only stopping his use of a plutonium bomb but also impede the use of ""time inversion"" to plant it. This mind bending concept is where events of time run backwards. The Protagonist is briefly trained in aspects of time inversion before embarking on his journey and it is at this point that cinema goers get an opportunity to get their head around this dizzying notion. He is joined by a resourceful offsider who has all the great ideas (Twilight's Robert Pattinson) and early on we also meet Sator's wife (Aussie Elizabeth Debicki), who ends up the linchpin for both sides. The second half of the film is astounding movie making and as hinted in the trailer, has the action scenes running simultaneously, both forward and backward in time. When time intersects, the whole story inverts and is then viewed from the opposite perspective. It is by seeing action from a different viewpoint that helps piece together a puzzling story. However, putting this kind of conceptual script into moving pictures is something probably never attempted, but is achieved with such a damn stunning result.
Thankfully the cast all lifted their game to a high standard so as to compliment Nolan's most ambitious project to date.
Our Director spares no expense with locations employed in 7 countries, and set pieces built on a huge scale. An enormous luxury motor cruiser was hired as were giant catamarans from the SailGP series. (The aerial cinematography around these cats was special). And in one scene Nolan needed to build an airport set to crash a real jumbo jet into. How audacious can one get? Nolan likes the real thing and relies almost entirely on physical effects over CG creations, including when things go boom!
And the soundtrack (which was not Hans Zimmer this time), along with the soundmixer ensured the cinema rocked and vibrated like never before. The downside to this was some difficulty picking up certain dialogue (like in Interstellar). But who cares, the vision reveals many answers and was bold, brash and bonkers, and so perfect for the big screen. Described in one word....Phew!!"
1612,"Another movie from a terribly narcissist director who thinks it will make him look like a genius if he creates movies with cryptic, unpossible to follow scripts. I guess the audience didn't quite get the agenda back in the Inception days, but this thing is now getting old."
1613,"Okay, so ""The Joker"" gets an 8.5 on IMDB?That's a joke!Yet, Tenet, a better made, more innovative and original, unique movie gets all of these dumb reviews saying it's not good, and yet, again, ""Joker"" gets an 8.5?That goes to show you right there how dumb the world has gotten. This movie is at least TWICE as good as ""The Joker"", but the dumb ones put Joker like #58 in the top 250, and then they trash an actually truly phenomenal movie.You should all be ashamed. And I don't love Tenet, but I question the intellectual prowess of idiots who are rating a superior film."
1614,"Absolutely the most annoying film in quite sometime. Loud, confusing, contrived. There was no plot. No involvement with the audience to care. Inception was another of his overrated films. I was generous with my forgiving attitude. Forgivers remorse. Not a Nolan fan."
1615,"I read the reviews where people said watching it again made the movie a masterpiece. So after a disappointing first screening I gave it another chance. Big mistake! Christopher Nolan has finally lost it, and TENET is disappointing. The star power, big action sequences make no difference. A lot of the time you can't hear the actors as the lines are mumbled and the soundtrack is too loud. Save your money, don't watch this in theatres."
1616,Mindblowing scene after mindblowing scene. This movie is so intense and the soundtrack fits perfectly.
1617,"A very disappointing Nolan movie in general.
In the shade of his father John David does not reach any level of being a pro actor.
Very confusing story and hard to understand the audio"
1618,"Not a bad film just not as good as it could of been. Some terrible acting from peripheral characters, some unnecessary peripheral characters and the worst sound I've ever encountered. I had to cover my ears through the action and couldn't understand a lot of the conversations taking place through gas masks and under a banging score. The two lead actors were great together. Might watch it again when it comes to a streaming sight so I can control the volume and consider its meaning in my own time."
1619,"Watched until this inverse ammunition,
After this it was time wo walk out."
1620,Once again why does Hollywood think lets save our movie with a great score. Here lies the problem with this mess of a film that relies to much on dynamic pieces of music to save a very average movie that has had so much hype once again. I wanted to like it but in the end all i liked was the score and music period.
1621,"I know Nolan's movies will be confusimg. But strange thing is people started taking pride in saying that the movie is good. Only because the other guys says he understood and this fellow cannot say that and he adds a word good. But truth is none understood.In general going to English movies is for action, fun , thrill. Who the hell need theory.One thing I felt good about movie is, hero in the movie acted as if he understood the story."
1622,"Despite all the cinematic wonders the other reviewers describe, this movie lacks the devices of great storytelling, and this is always more important to me. The characters are bland, at most, and I just didn't care about any of them, even if they were going to ""save the world"". As one of the other reviewers aptly explained, this is such a cliché, it's become utterly boring. At least, if there had been something to care about, this might be entertaining, but I have to conclude this was mostly a waste of my time. Hence the 3, and not a lower rating."
1623,"I finally got to see Tenet last night (and in IMAX, no less), in an enormous AMC that had 10 out of 125 seats filled.And, holy smokes, my mind is STILL spinning.This is a phenomenal film. Christopher Nolan is an absolute genius-there is almost no way any film of this kind will be made again, no matter what you think of the film itself. It is enormously complex, and there is no possible way to understand all of the film without seeing it more than once (or at the very least, seeing it only once it is released online/on DVD with the subtitles on and slowing down and analyzing the scenes where the rules of the film's world are explained). But the amazing way Tenet succeeds is that if you actually sit down (with a piece of paper or a laptop) and write out the rules of time that Nolan sets for this world, the film makes sense. There are no plot holes, no ""but according to this, then that scene doesn't make sense"", no cheap tricks that the movie pulls for convenience. None. It is absolutely masterful.The acting is superb. John David Washington gives a controlled, smooth, very well-balanced performance as The Protagonist (and while it may seem weird and annoying that no name is given, it's extremely clever how the film almost seems to poke fun at the audience for this-he's asked ""Who are you?"" or ""Mr...?"" several times, never giving a straight answer once), Robert Pattinson blends into his role as The Protagonist's partner (or more accurately, his ""handler"", as the espionage world goes) and physics expert with an assuredness that makes you wonder how the heck he possibly managed to understand half of what he was talking about, and Elizabeth Debicki fits the part of Kat (art dealer, and more importantly, the estranged wife of Branagh's terrifying villain) supremely. But it would be shameful not to give a special mention to Kenneth Branagh; his performance as Andre Sator-an immeasurably powerful, merciless Russian oligarch and Kat's husband-is unbelievable. There are shots of his face that filled the 70x50 foot screen last night that would send chills down one's spine; he is brutal, terrifying, and extremely intelligent (Branagh's best performance in a decade). The rest of the cast, from Clemence Poesy to Michael Caine to Martin Donovan, play their roles perfectly.Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is spectacular. It is quite possibly the best of the year (the movie should definitely been seen on the biggest screen possible, preferably IMAX), throwing you into the midst of the action while still being beautifully vivid, detailed and meticulous. I was worried about Lee Smith (Nolan's brilliant editor for every one of his films since Batman Begins) not being available for this one (although, in fairness, he was unavailable because he was doing last year's masterpiece ""1917""-enough said), but Jennifer Lame was up to the task, doing a brilliant job all the way through.I have seen people complaining that the sound mixing was unclear. This is untrue-it is hard to make out the dialogue at times, but the reason for that is because in several scenes (notably the opening 10 minutes, which are absolutely incredible), the characters are masked, and while we can hear their voices just fine, it's hard to make out what they're saying without subtitles; while this may be a difficulty for first time viewers in the audience, it's not a flaw in the filmmaking.In my opinion, the one real (albeit minor) flaw in the film was Ludwig Goransson's score (Hans Zimmer was already committed to Denis Villenueve's ""Dune""). It relies largely on synthesizer and techno, and while it is thrilling at times (especially during certain scenes), it winds up being overused to the point where it runs a bit stale. It's not awful by any means, but it's not great, especially given the exceptional scores one is used to hearing in Nolan's films.But ultimately, this minor flaw is enormously overshadowed by the absolute brilliance of this film. It is, yet again, sheer mastery from the greatest living director and screenwriter alive, one Christopher Nolan. He is simply on another level. The enormous dedication and effort he puts into his films is jaw-droppingly phenomenal, especially in this day and age (when things have unfortunately become all about money, cheapness and wokeness), with real, true, quality filmmaking almost nonexistent. It is because of filmmakers like Nolan that movies of this caliber still exist. His otherworldly direction, writing, and attention to every minor detail are on full display (once again) in this masterpiece.Make no mistake about it: Tenet is unlike anything ever made, and the likes of which nothing will probably ever be made again. Aside from that, it is an astonishing work of art."
1624,"So convoluted, couldn't follow the storyline! My husband & I had to shut it off, it was that bad! I'm a B-movie horror film lover, 2 star movies are always in my wheelhouse...but this was even too awful for me!!"
1625,"This has a very similar feel to temporal films but flawed, the whole inverted aspect was far fetched with only parts of reality inverted. The Deja Vu film was a much better example of how to close the loop. I like Nolan films but this one was trying to be over clever."
1626,"I can't understand half of the dialog, consequently I have no clue what the hell is happening. As a home theater guy I thought maybe we have a bad theater. Out of utter frustration I'm reading reviews instead of watching the movie. The good news is I'm not alone. Many reviews mention terrible sound mixing. I'll buy it on blue ray and watch with subtitles to give it a second shot. But for now I'd rather me home in bed."
1627,"Don't see it in cinema
Download the movie in home coz you need to reverse it 100 times to understand what is going on"
1628,"To the user who asked if they were alone not being able to hear what was said... no you weren't. Worst audio ever and I've seen better acting at my sons nativity play.
Confusing isn't the word. So looked forward to this. Crap is maybe too a strong word to describe it....ar*e water is probably better.
The expression 'over-hyped' didn't exist until this movie was made.
Avoid people. The 2 stars are for the visuals. That's it."
1629,A almost unexplainable storyline that has been hyped up. So many questions unanswered and more arise. So many contradictions that try along the Inception theory but doesn't connect any of the dots. Great action scenes but they should have spent allot more time on the plot. Wait until Netflix for this one.
1630,"Nice picture, sounds good. But the content is too complicated.Most of Nolan's work is the same.Most viewers after watching say they don't know what they just watched??.Admire Nolan for the logic of the content, but they're like a mess.I noticed that the best picture Oscar winners are usually quite understandable films such as: No country for old men, gladiator, green book,...."
1631,The Lead Role was Ruined from the Start by David John. REALLY BAD👎🏻.
1632,"Overly complicated just to make you feel dumb and fearful of saying that it's NOT a masterpiece. Well, I said it here: It's not a masterpiece; and maybe I'm dumb. 😁"
1633,"I did understand nothing. Sorry but when I go to movies, I want to enjoy myself not trying to fix puzzles. I was trying to concentrate on the plot as I could but I quit 30 minutes before the end."
1634,"It's not a bad movie, but it's really disturbing that I was constantly thinking ""is this correct"", ""do all persons react as they should if someone is going by backwards"" and so on. And finally really everything was foreseeable while the story tries to hide it by pretending being super complicate while we finally have only someone like james bond and one evil person like blofeld and that's it. Ok, we do not have cats. That is really sad."
1635,"I was going to say it was fire,
but it was very fire"
1636,Stick to filming Batman. Movie was horrible made 0 sense. Very disappointed
1637,"I regret wasting 2.5 hours watching this movie. Even fantasy stories need some logic and justification of its events. It is completely nonsense and incredibly silly from the beginning, with poor plot, poor thread, poor acting and poor script."
1638,Washington is not suited for top billing. That the fun that a movie should be
1639,"Nolan created another masterpiece.The story is mindblowing,Every little detail is connected to eachother.At the start my mind was a mess like everybody had but the story develops and makes it easier to understand.You should definitely watch it,im so mindblown that i cant find words to write ."
1640,"A brilliantly made movie, great acting especially Robert Pattison, and loads of action, but misses the mark in sci-fi substance. The idea of time inversion is excellent, yet the act of time travel is completely ignored in explanation. The philosophy of reality in the past and the physical effects on the body are well though of, but the slower parts of the movie needed more technical detail to make it a classic.
So much potential, but too many gaps of information. Overall missed the mark of what it could have been."
1641,Needed a Tom Cruise ! But I guess in the current political climate it had to been a non white leading role ! As far as the script and story goes . At least with momento and inception and even interstellar we coud work what was happening in time travel but this was a mess ! I don't want to spend my time trying to fathom out in every scene what is actually happening !
1642,"I have followed Christopher nolan from momento, and this is by far the best movie of Nolan.The complication in the script is too beautiful which you never understand when you watch for 1st time. Some dialoges won't be heared and some scene you would have missed which have massive importance at the end.So, instead of thinking too much, watch this masterpiece in theaters. Not in small screen. For its astounding BGM, production design, acting and for nolan. What more reason you want?!"
1643,"And the point is there is no point. I got halfway through and then just gave up. I did not understand what was going on, I did not empathize with any character, I thought the overall quality - sound etc., - was seriously lacking. Tenet is everything that Inception was not. Inception had style, complexity, fine direction, fine performances but the main thing was I could follow it. Halfway through Tenet I no longer cared. Had this come out without Covid impact it would have flopped. Strange little things like the casting - Elizabeth Debicki is tall, there is nothing wrong with that except she made her fellow actors look like hobbits. Branagh is a nasty Russian - that's it. Washington has no flair; I did not believe anything about Pattinson. At times I thought I was watching a version of the The Expendables without the subtlety (can you believe that?). No spoiler here - I don't know how it ends."
1644,"I watched it in theaters and I fell asleep halfway. Never been so dissapointed for a movie like this one. Just couldn't believe this was from the same guy that made all the other masterpieces like Interstellar, Inceptions etz...Very boring start and the more you watch the more you're confused."
1645,"Christopher Nolan is one of my favourite directors and I've managed to follow all of his previous complicated plots well. This is unnecessarily messy, the jumping between locations is disorienting and the whole temporal aspect is not well explained and it just further confuses the viewer. I'm able to understand complex plots usually but this felt badly explained, vague and the viewer is going to be left behind in most cases.
The acting is good, the presentation is generally good. The characters are hollow and the script is just functional. Might have been an ambitious movie but it's probably a case of ambition over substance."
1646,"There is just way too much substance and not enough soul in Tenet. Half of the movie is very confusing/difficult to understand dialogue, and the other half is very confusing/difficult to understand action.Now, keep in mind that the audio is *not* Hans Zimmer, and you can tell. You really have to watch this movie with subtitles. If someone were to pause the movie and have them explain to them what was going on, you wouldn't be able to do it.The thing with Nolan's other movies are, yes, they can be confusing, but since they are good, you *want* to watch them a second time. With this, you *have* to watch it a second time to get anything out of it.
And who wants to do that?"
1647,"The story and script are all amazing. It messes with your mind. It's a very complicated movie, but when you get it, it will all make sense. Must watch, maybe even watch it twice."
1648,"The protagonist (John David Washington) is set in a time-bending, dangerous mission to prevent World War 3 from happening.Tenet is a complex and a powerful movie, it's not Christopher Nolan's best movie but it's also not his worst one, for those who are saying that it's not as good as Inception or Batman: the dark knight, I agree but let's be clear, I don't think there will be a movie in the same level as Inception or Batman: the dark knight, these two movies are for sure Nolan's masterpieces, so I won't compare Tenet to Nolan's past movies.John David Washington's performance was so powerful, he was truly amazing and can't imagine the movie without him, Robert Pattison (plays Neil) was also amazing and surprised me with his great performance, and Elizabeth Debcki (plays Kat) who I wasn't surprised how amazing she is in Tenet and that's because ever since I saw her in ""Widows"" (2018) I said that the next time she'll be in a big movie, she'll do a great job with her performance, and that's what happened in Tenet, her facial expressions and the way she wants to introduce or express her character's feelings whether it's happiness, sadness or grief, she'll know how to express it perfectly. In the end, the cast of Tenet was so amazing and every choice was perfect except for one, Kenneth Branagh (plays Andrei Sator) who has a big / important role in the film, I didn't feel his acting that much especially that he plays the villain and I felt like he was trying so bad to show us how his character is the villain but couldn't, I think many other actors can give us a better performance.The music that was so amazing and when you hear it you'll think that it's composed by Hans Zimmer but you'll be surprised that it's not. The music in Tenet is composed by Ludwig Göransson who I think will have a great career especially after I heard the music of Tenet, I mean he already composed the music of ""Black Panther"" (2018) which was great and he won an Oscar but what's saying is that I can't wait to hear his music in the upcoming movies, great choice of music. And also the song Called: The Plan by: Travis Scott was amazing, really loved it.Sound mixing and sound editing were bad, felt like in some scenes I was struggling to understand the speech, I don't know if it was me or the theatre that I was in, or is it the movie itself?? In some scenes felt like something was wrong and the words weren't clear and the music was louder than the speech.The production design was fascinating, and the camera angles made it look way better.The opening scene of the movie was a perfect way to start the movie, loved the action in it and it'll make you feel that what's coming next will be better. The action scenes in the whole movie were so impressive anyways they might seem normal and in many movies but in Tenet they were different because to see people who are moving backwards and moving onwards fight or are in a highway chase is just so impressive and mind-blowing.Cinematography & colors were great, especially that room that the lights in it were red and blue was very cool.
The fact the movie didn't use green screens is just mind blowing, i mean it's not a new thing for Nolan but it's just so shocking that all these scenes were ACTUALLY filmed, that airplane crash scene is just crazy and can't imagine how it looked like in real life, or the chasing car scenes, or all the reversed scenes, amazing and shocking work.Christopher Nolan is a director that likes his movie to be so complex and make his audience ask many questions that's why Tenet in a movie that you have to watch more than once, and you have to watch it on the big screen (way better if it's IMAX) to have the perfect experience. The movie is a complex one and very hard to understand, but with all of that, I enjoyed watching it and it's such a powerful movie with powerful action scenes and story that I didn't find anything to hate about.My rating is: 8.5/10"
1649,"It's like Inception, only more confusing. I should have known going in that this movie was going to play with my mind, questioning reality, like a narrative Mobius strip. Like Inception, like Interstellar. The overbearing soundtrack and characters in oxygen masks muffling dialogue didn't help.
Beautiful scenery, clever set pieces, great performances and suspenseful action sequences aside, this was one of the most frustrating film experiences I've ever had. I will not watch it again."
1650,"Excellent film. The stand out performances were Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki. Pattinson is amazing in this ""sidekick"" role, but he is so much more than that after the movie wraps up.John David Washington is great as the lead. The movie starts slowly with a lot being said/explained to keep you invested and the exposition is required. It moves fluidly right up to the half way point where things get tricky and start to get confusing. By the end of the film, it wraps up some loose ends but still leaves you a little flabbergasted. A second watch is necessary to explain little things you miss in the first viewing and it increases the film's rewatchability.Overall it is an entertaining picture. It's loud, fast, interesting and the cinematography and pace is great. There are a couple spots where dialogue is difficult to hear and understand but you do understand what the character is doing and why they are doing it.There are two scenes that completely blew me away, scenes that I've never seen before in a movie which, for the small amount of movie buffs who WANT to see things they've never seen before, add a little extra to the final product. You clearly see the production value and effort that took place.Watch it on the big screen, imax or dolby. You'll understand why Nolan didn't want it released direct to video or stream."
1651,Tenet is an absolute masterpiece. The movie has so many twist and turns. It is a movie that you just need to see. Great job Mr. Nolan.
1652,"I couldn't understand 25% of what was being said and not many will because of how the actors were talking with lots of background action/music distraction. Had serious problems keeping up with what was going on, and trust me I tried! There are moments of cinematic brilliance with the way some scenes are elaborately shot, and there are a few of them, joyful to watch. But from an overall viewing experience, i can't recommend this film unless u have the patience to watch it 2-3 times and then reflect on it from another perspective."
1653,After the second viewing all the pieces fell in place for me and I was able to have an emotional connections to the characters and their journey.Another home run from Nolan. Don't read any spoilers just see it.
1654,"One of the best Nolan films I have seen, and also one of the best films I have ever seen. Captivating from begginning till end. I understand why some might dislike it. Give it a chance if you love time travel themes and director Christopher Nolan."
1655,"This movie, unlike a lot of other movies, is really best told in this medium. It would be very difficult to tell this story in a convincing manner in book-form. It's a movie that wants to be a lot, and it is, but it's lacking the last bit of refinement - some of the plot, especially the ending, comes too easy and unexplained. He died, but they solved it just in time? What was going to happens if they didn't fix it? Was the world going to explode ""in time""?A proper directors cut, and some refinement on sound mixing, and this movie could be the best movie to come out since interstellar."
1656,"Saw this in IMAX and missed a lot of the dialog because of low center channel and poor EQing of voices. Nolan needs to work with a better studio for the final mix. This keep happening to his films. Great film, hard to hear half the time.
PS I'm not deaf, most other films sound perfectly fine to me."
1657,"Hard to figure out whole story while first time watch, but i like the concept and visual effect."
1658,"Thank you, Christopher Nolan. It's so amazing cinema!"
1659,"Movie is phenomenal. Those who state otherwise are entitled to do so but do so futilely from the more negative reviews I've read. The plot, albeit complex, is totally encompassing of Nolans directory throughout the years. Nolan's play and take on time and the impact that can have when altered and twisted continues with Tenet. Cinematography is of course mesmerically engrossing but the real highlight here is the plot. The plots bordering on theoretical physics and inversion parallels will leave many viewers perplexed. This is expected, but for those who understand the plot and follow the sequences will realise just how much of a masterpiece this is. In my top ten of all time"
1660,"I'm sorry to say that, but we left in the middle of the movie from the cinema. Absolutely uninteresting, boring, random, terrible movie 😑"
1661,I was excited to see this based on all the reviews.....guess i should have waited and seen the REAL reviews here. Had to leave early and thankfully got my $ back. Didn't make any sense...couldn't understand what was going on....and what was with the backwards thing ??? smh
1662,"Memento - Suspense. Interesting characters and character development.Prestige - Ruthless competition. Mysterious characters and character development.The Dark Knight trilogy - Realism. High stakes. Phenomenal character development.Inception - High concept. Unstable, flawed characters. Amazing character development.Interstellar - Incredibly human (for a space film).The key attributes from his previous movies that make Nolan one of my all time favorite directors are all missing in Tenet.I was bored.I didn't care what happened to the characters.Not caring for what happens to the characters is to not care about what happens to the movie.The only character development that comes through this movie is Nolan.It made him more human to me.You'll get through this Nolan, I believe in you.To quote from TDK series - Why do we fall?"
1663,A high concept that needs to come back down to earth in order to build itself up properly as a film. The plaster doesn't quite cover the rough edges and the convolution shows up visibly as a mess.
1664,"There's nothing worse than commenting on movies we don't like. But the latest mess with palindromic title with of so-called renowned director Christopher Nolan does not deserve to be simply ignored. It deserves at least a few remarks, in order not to be forgotten.If it took years for someone to write about such a scenario, full of inconsistencies and holes, each of which is bigger than the poorly interpreted idea, it would be wiser to ask e.g. a graduate physicist, who has not spent so many years in vain, to clarify to him the concepts of entropy, the arrow of time, the theory of cause-and-effect relations in quantum mechanics, and so on. But even if we ignore all that, every movie is a fantasy, including excellent ""Inception"", at least consistent, if nothing else, then to itself, unlike this one, which at the very beginning in one scene prescribes ""in order to pick up a reverse entropic bullet, you must first drop it"", so in the next scene it is no longer valid, and so on until the end of the film.The acting is, sadly, also a failure, but here I don't include the main Protagonist, who didn't deserve so far at all to be called an actor. But with such an unfortunate story and such assigned stereotypical characters, there was probably no room for such a thing.In addition to the fact that, when Hollywood no longer knows what kind of car chase to shoot, all that remains is to picture chase in reverse, this film seems to follow the latest concept according to which the most meaningless plot should be messed up, hollow dialogues should be recorded so that they are heard and understood as little as possible (including a few spoken sentences over eating a food of guest star Michael Caine), lest the gullible audience think there was something else to see (and to hear), and that some would be fooled into watching this film again, hoping in vain that something s/he may have missed.In short, a shameful attempt to make another action James Bond film with a few sci-fi elements for the pretentious viewers who will not regret watching the film over and over again, trying to ""understand"" it. It's just that every James Bond's movie is far more interesting than this.As someone has already mentioned, yes, it may be looked at once again, but backwards, if only they return the money for the ticket at the end at the box office, and no other way 👎"
1665,"I think the movie is overrated. I feel like when people hear that Nolan directed something they are going crazy and get ready to praise everything they see.
It is overcomplicated and I honestly don't get it how someone can like something when they don't understand it. The main female character is depicted as a helpless victim whose only purpose is her son. She doesn't contribute to the plot.She is just being there waiting to be executed or saved. It seems like women in this world don't exist.
I don't recommend."
1666,"More like ""BLOOD GOLD."" Reminds me of the movie, ""Blood Diamonds,"" however, with better production, screen writing, editing, and plot."
1667,Absolutely epic the first time and words cannot explain the second. Nolan has done it again! Prepare to bring your thinking caps. Possibly read about time and physics before hand haha.
1668,"Its confusing at first but as the film goes on it all starts to come together. Amazing concept, Amazing excecution. Best movie of the year thus far."
1669,I couldn't hear half of the dialogue. And it wasn't just my 40 year old ears. My two teenage sons had the same issue. We couldn't hear conversations properly. When this comes out on streaming services or dvd then I'll watch it again and no doubt revise my score. I can tell it was a great movie... i just need to be able to hear the dialogue between characters to really understand what's going on and the dynamic between them. Visually it was spectacular and a love the concept.
1670,"Nolan was right on the spot from first frame.
He explained the inversion concept clearly if watch the movie with subtitles
Yes audio it but clumsy
Great movie to watch in theatre, yes it requires second watch for better understanding"
1671,"Amazing piece of work, even after you finish it first time you will be interested in watching the movie again ana again."
1672,"If you haven't seen this film, See.It.NOW.Christopher Nolan does what he does best. Tell new stories that are so so intelligent and unique, like this one. The plot is just mind bending and the more you understand the film, the better it gets. While 2020 has been a bad year, this film immerse's you into its world and is a huge positive of the year.I believe people are making a fuss and being sensitive with the sound. Yeah sometimes it was a little loud but just move on and don't let that ruin the movie for you.While not Christopher Nolan's best movie, its still easily well above the standard of movies. The acting is amazing. Give it a watch."
1673,"First of all, I feel so passionately disappointed in this film that I created an IMDB account just to write this.This film is loud. The soundtrack is stunning but overpowering - so much so that I felt as though I missed a good 70% of the dialogue. The use of masks was creative to distinguish between forward and reverse but it was near impossible to understand what the characters were saying.The plot is confusing. Don't get me wrong - I am all for a good puzzle that slowly unfolds and you get an 'aha!' moment at the end. However, this film left me with so many questions. Why was the protagonist so intent on helping Kat? What was his motivation behind the whole 'painting in the airport' scene? Why was the russian antagonist so keen on ending the world? It is so unclear. I enjoyed the reverse entropy plot - it could have been executed SO much better though. Also, it is about an hour too long.+1 star for the score, and +2 for the incredible acting, especially by Robert Pattinson.I left the cinema feeling confused and lost - no doubt a second watch would clarify some things, but I have absolutely no desire to put myself through that again."
1674,"I think no one sees ""time"" better than Christopher Nolan.
The direction of this movie is the best I have seen in my life nothing comes close, this has to win Oscar for best direction.Of course one can nitpick as something doesn't make sense but all that can over look as how much thinking and passion has gone into making this movie, the aspect of revinding the time is amazing and please don't expect to get this movie in one watch, it will atleast take 3 watches for average human being to appreciate this masterpiece."
1675,"I went to watch the movie, knowing the critics on the soundtrack and plot confusion. However, I found the soundtrack perfect for the movie, I was completely immerged into the movie. I did not have problems to understand the dialogs. I realized that dialogs not important from background people were covered by the music (higher level), so you focus on the action. Then, when important to listen to the dialogs, the music was less loud).
The plot asks to pay attention and to probably rewatch it, to understand all layers. I guess that's what I like for this kind of movie. This is a well crafted movie, which respects the audience enough to explains the theory behind. If they would not have done this, people would have critized that it was not realistic or impossible.
I liked how it gradually increase the complexity as the protagonist finds out about inversion. The action scenes are amazing, I have never seen this before! I love how Nolan takes a genre and re-invent it with something new and challenging!"
1676,"Usually I give movies 10 stars, but I went to see this movie with a woman I really have a crush on and she was so confused. After the movie, she mentioned to me: "" all I know is that I saw a movie"". For myself: I watched Tenet twice and anticipate watching it multiple more times to understand it. I really hope that Warner Bros green-lights this movie as a trilogy for Christopher Nolan to direct because I believe that this movie could have the same impact as the Matrix if it receives more explanation as to how a person can "" time-travel"" as the young woman I went to see the movie with: she calls it. The story is so well researched that the audience feels dumb. Whoever wrote this movie is either a genius or spent years doing research. All together: this movie gets 9 stars for how confusing it was even on the second go around."
1677,This was a very entertaining movie. The people that say it's confusing clearly didn't pay attention.
1678,"Nolan again plays his strengths.
In terms of cinematography it's definitely a masterpiece and there are a lot of parallels to his former movies like Inception, Interstellar etc.
BUT overall it doesn't really function this time.
The plot is not understandable to me and my colleagues.
There remains so much unanswered in the end and Nolan doesn't manage to make his sort of Bond-Style-Movie.
This is my opinion after I saw it twice.
Watch it on your own and decide what you think about it."
1679,This movie really excels at getting your attention the whole duration. After your enter the cinema you still will be processing all the information this movie provided you. A must see!
1680,"Tenet is not a movie, it's more like algorithm or scheme. But not a story in its usual form. Dramaturgy from another time-line where Nolan completely lost interest tell story about humans.
I love that in Tenet main characters are concepts and if you think about it, you can do a lot with that idea and to fully understand you need see movie more than once or twice. Actually puzzle that movie dictates is not hard but shown to audience in strange way."
1681,"This is Christopher Nolan's finest work when it comes to time manipulation. That does not mean it is his finest work but it keeps you in the edge of your seat and checks all the Nolan boxes. All I would say is watch Memento before you go see this, paying attention to how the timeline moves. Incredible film, definitely going to see it again soon."
1682,"From start to finish I was left confused by the whole story. Inception I felt was clever, it kept you guessing. This film, just made you second guess the whole plot. Perhaps the idea is to make the viewer feel dumb. Other reviewers say you have to see it twice, I regret seeing it once. I just felt a complete disconnection from the whole film, I wasn't drawn to any of the characters and for the most part it felt like they were just speaking their lines. Issues with sound are noticeable. Other than some decent action scenes (that were dumbed down to make it a 12a rating) it really was a nothing of a film."
1683,"The first time I watched it the movie was tough to follow and definitely gave me a headache. After my head settled down for a few days, I went to watch it again and it was a much better experience as it was easier to follow the plot and I knew what was happening. Visuals are amazing, and the cast does great too."
1684,"At first watch I was left confused to say the least, however, having watched the film again I love it and would consider it better than any of his Batman films. I realise this might be controversial but it's only my opinion."
1685,"What can I say? Christopher Nolan brings us another one of his unique and mind-twisting stories in a way that only he and his team can deliver in Tenet. Movies truly do not get much better than this. To really grasp the understanding this film, multiple viewing will be necessary.Everything about this movie met my expectations, if not exceeded it. Tenet is a masterpiece! Bravo to everyone who worked on this movie. Will it be the savior for movie theatres and revive the movie-going experience? Well, I can't speak for others but I can tell you this; There were hardly any slow moments. Tenet was action-packed from the beginning to the end. The cinematography was very captivating to my eyes. The costumes looked so appealing. The score by Ludwig Göransson was as expected; fantastic. I've been listening to the soundtrack all week. And the story is one that only Christopher Nolan and his team could bring to life, flawlessly. Yes, it is very confusing. Trust me, give it time to grow on you so you can put the pieces together and complete the puzzle. After all, this is a Christopher Nolan movie we're talking about.John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki, Kenneth Branagh, and the remainder of the cast were so impressive! I expected them to give great performances but they really gave it their all in Tenet. Nolan knows how to bring together a wonderful cast and have them work together perfectly. You can feel the chemistry between the characters throughout the whole movie.I first saw it in an AMC IMAX theatre and it was so wild that my adrenaline was through the roof the whole time! My one complaint would be the sound mixing. Sometimes it was hard to understand what the characters were saying because the score and sound effects would sometimes play over them and drown out the word. After my second and third viewing, I loved the movie even more. I understood it better and I focused much harder. Plus, I went to Regal those two times where the sound was easier for me to follow and understand the characters.Many people also say that there wasn't enough emotion put into The Protagonist's character and there wasn't much of a background story. To me, I'm perfectly fine with that. The mystery behind this whole film is another factor that makes Tenet worth watching many times. To me, he goes by John.To conclude, Tenet isn't your ordinary time movie. It so original in a way that it portrays time so differently from other time movies through the use of inversion and Nolan's intelligence. After seeing it 3 times already and watching countless hours of Tenet trailers, I'm still not finished understanding Tenet completely. It was truly mind-blowing and I would recommend everyone to watch it in an IMAx theatre first. A century from now, Christopher Nolan will still be talked about as one of the greatest directors ever."
1686,"Chris nolan is one of the best directors/writers out there!
especially, he hates 3d cinema ;)I have seen Tenet twice now and I recommend EVERYONE to do the samefirst time: really confusing, but quite goodsecond watch: masterpiece!thanks for all the good stuff he produced and I hope that he will continue telling these mind-bending stories!"
1687,"Brilliant movie, first time I watched I was a bit lost. Then watched for a second time and I thought it was brilliant. Chris Nolan is genius."
1688,"The story is sooooo incredible !
Story, action, music, acting, evrything is perfect....when you understand everything.
Real deap story, with twisted timeline.
Christopher Nolan's mind is nothing but normal. A genius !"
1689,"Good actors, amazing soundtrack, well made and entertaining, cool action but still have no idea what just happened. The three people I went with don't understand it either. It takes a lot of concentration to really understand the story. I'm so confused and left the theatre puzzled, and not exactly satisfied. Edit: watched it a second time and I get it a little more and appreciate how much effort really went into this big movie"
1690,"I watched this movie because i want to see something new. i don't want to compare it. this movie make you feel that inversion is realistic concept like which can happen in real.
Best thing about this movies is - it get better with time."
1691,"One of the best movies ever on the big screen, Nolan put up a perfect plot. This is so complex, you will probably have to watch it a few times. Too good to be true."
1692,"First and foremost, I'm not an action movie fan. The reason for this is that for most action movies I have zero emotional connections to the characters.
This is also true for Tenet and mostly true for all Nolan movies.
The thing that sets Tenet apart from the rest of the genre is that the plot of this movie is so dense and hard to follow while still being completely consistent.It is very entertaining to try to keep up and try to beat Nolan by making sense of everything that is happening on screen. The concept of time inversion is something that is quite easy to wrap your head around, but Nolan goes absolutely nuts with it, making this movie also really fun on a second watch.Go watch it in a cinema if it plays near you, they really need our money and we need to be entertained in these challenging times."
1693,Great storyline concept and genius having someone look at their choices and mistakes in consecutive scenarios for growth! But 40 minutes lost saving a total stranger and losing sight on saving the world and yourself isn't collateral damage for a great movie!
1694,"How many of these reviewers have watched the film i wonder. It's watchable, but then what else is there to watch on the big screen? Nothing so this is considered amazing after a 6 month break. Watch it for yourself, 6 might be too high."
1695,"This isn't Nolan's best movie - that belongs to the brilliant but ultimately flawed Interstellar. This isn't Nolan's Bond either no matter what other bone-headed reviewers say. This is Nolan's Red Dwarf. Specifically, this is Nolan's 'Backwards' episode of Red Dwarf. The Protagonist (come on Nolan! You couldn't think of a name for this character? Dave Lister maybe?) who should have been the every-man that hooks in the audience - a weakness making Nolan lose his chance to truly engage the audience. His partner, the charming Neil (Robert Pattinson) is Red Dwarf's Cat (with more Hollywood white-washing at work). The slimy, and ultimately childish, Andrei (Kenneth Branagh) (""If I can't have it no-one can!"") is obviously Red Dwarfs Rimmer. The Protagonists drive is to look out for a woman called, ironically, Kat (Elizabeth Debicki) in the same way Lister looked out for Kochansky in Red Dwarf. And Red Dwarfs Kryten would have explained all the time shenanigans better than Nolan did (and in a much shorter time). Injuries coming on before they happened, backwards puddles, birds, fights and talking all came from an episode of Red Dwarf. Nolan just dresses it all up with the 'inverted time' gimmick. Also, as is well known, all the timey-wimey stuff in Tenet was done in-camera with no cgi. Guess what? So was Red Dwarfs. Should Tenet be seen at the cinema? Definitely. Could it be better? Yes, the movie is too po-faced to be great and Nolan forgot to steal the sense of humour from Red Dwarf when he took everything-else."
1696,"This feels like the epitome of what a Nolan-movie is. It's stylish, action-packed, inventive and epic. However the other side of that coin is that it's also drab, unengaging, contrived and too long for it's own best.The film is built around one quite clever idea of time travel which is then used to throw our characters from one inventive action-scene to the next. A lot of the film is explained through dialogue - in fact almost all of the dialogue is just exposition - and functions as a way to set up the next action scene. Too bad that the film is also so confusing that the action scenes themselves have almost no tension to them whatsoever. It's never really clear why the bad guys are doing what they're doing - or why it's bad. Or who they are. Our protagonist is just fighting a gimmick (sometimes with a gimmick of his own).Zero emotion, except for maybe thrills in some scenes. But even those are lacking toward the end, because there's really nothing to care about."
1697,"To keep it short there were moments that made sense but within Nolan films there are often moments of explaining in quite environments, whereas all the key messages from conversations in the film were done when there was so much background noise. I couldn't hear 60% of the words in the film and all other sound was extremely loud. I had to cover my ears all explosion scenes and it was still loud.The plot would make sense if you heard any words in the film"
1698,"Very good movie, but in my opinion it was not confusing and easy to follow,it was complex but well explained"
1699,"The bad first - Poor sound mixing makes some of the dialogue inaudible, some of the dialogue and delivery is quite hammy, flat and amateur hour. Quite surprised by some of the bad acting.
The good - awesome visuals.
Overall, fun but no heart."
1700,"The movie was difficult to follow, the background sound effects were way too loud and the speech was difficult to pick up. It didn't help that the lead actors performance lacked charisma and his speech was not clear enough. It is a clever movie, but not particularly enjoyable. Maybe it would be better on a 2nd watch, if they fix the sound."
1701,"One of the best movies I have seen, but I have to watch it again to understand some of the details."
1702,"There are two main problems with this film. First, I probably missed 30% of the dialogue because the sound mixing was so bad. In fact, it was so poor I started to feel relieved when the music subsided because it meant I didn't have to strain to hear what people were saying. After it was done, a stranger randomly asked me if something was wrong with the theater's speakers. However, after a quick google it appears that a lot of people are having issues with this.Secondly, this film does not make any sense. This isn't a spoiler as it is shown in the trailer, but doing stuff like catching a bullet breaks causality. No matter how you justify it, this is so non-intuitive and far-fetched from reality it harms the film. This is a far cry from Nolan's other similar films like Inception and Interstellar.However, I still gave it a higher score because there were some really interesting, unique, and thought provoking concepts that I go to Nolan's films for. It will certainly benefit from re-watches (preferably with subtitles) to appreciate the film in its entirety."
1703,"Jawdropping, that's the word that describes this film the best."
1704,"If you like any Nolan film you know what you're in for. Just see it, it's an amazing movie, you're in for a treat.
Critics are just nitpicking I can't believe it, why not just enjoy it. It's interesting to see how fast moving this film is to get it's story into 2:30h of playtime. But, that still doesn't keep it from being great. JUST WATC IT, TWICE."
1705,"One of the things that I really hated about this movie is the fact that they repeated all this speech about saving the world too many times, it tired me somehow. If is not because is an audiovisual masterpiece, I'll probably rated it lower. In my opinion is the best movie Nolan have done technically, but not the best movie overall"
1706,"You won't find a more closely guarded yet eagerly anticipated movie this year than 'Tenet', described as writer-director Christopher Nolan's most ambitious yet. Little has been revealed about its plot, except that it has to do with a secret agent - known only in the movie as The Protagonist (John David Washington) - who is recruited by a shadowy Government organisation to prevent World War III from being wrought by time inversion.Time has always fascinated Nolan, right from his crime thriller 'Memento' from two decades ago, to his heist movie 'Inception' a decade ago, and even to his last World War II movie 'Dunkirk'. Here, Nolan goes even further than all his earlier films, suggesting that time can not only be reversed but also co-exist simultaneously between past and present, such that people can move backwards and forwards through time at the same time.It is an audacious proposition no doubt; but as straightforward as it might sound on paper, you'll know if you've seen any one of Nolan's previous works that it is a lot more complex in practice. True enough, we must admit that we found ourselves rather perplexed by its concepts, comprising algorithms, the Manhattan project and the grandfather paradox among others. Even with a generous amount of exposition delivered by Clémence Poésy, Michael Caine and Hindi legend Dimple Kapadia, we doubt anyone would be able to keep it with its multiple narrative loops at first viewing.That doesn't mean it isn't entertaining; indeed, even as you might end up befuddled, even frustrated, at its physics and logic, there's no denying that you'll be thoroughly hooked from the get-go by Nolan's James Bond-equivalent. Without naming his Protagonist, Nolan has fashioned a Bond-style espionage thriller, with some time-twisting science-fiction thrown in to up the stakes.Within its two-and-a-half hour runtime, 'Tenet' brings its audience on a dizzying globe-trotting adventure - beginning in Kiev with a terrorist attack on a packed opera house; to Mumbai to meet the enigmatic wife (Kapadia) of an arms dealer; to Oslo for a jaw-dropping raid on a vault on the airside of an airport; and to the Mediterranean coast where the film's villain Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh) makes his home on board a luxurious yacht. It's as expansive as you can imagine, and that's not even counting the other stopover locations such as the cliffs of Italy's Amalfi Coast or the spare Nysted Wind Farm in Denmark.At least Washington has for company Robert Pattinson's intelligence officer Neil, who proves an invaluable ally in each one of his daring missions; the chemistry between Washington and Pattinson is understated, but their sheer charisma breathes humanity into the otherwise coolly calculated proceedings. Ditto for Elizabeth Debicki, as Andrei's estranged wife Kat; while it would have been all-too easy to paint her as a Bond girl, Nolan's writing gives her character more depth and purpose than you would expect, especially in relation to Branagh's effectively unsubtle villain.Yet more so than any of his other movies. 'Tenet' is propelled by its spectacular action set pieces, most of it done practically without the help of any CGI; among the most impressive include a freight plane that Neil's crew hijacks on the tarmac and crashes into one of the nearby cargo buildings, a freeway car chase with vehicles moving in both directions simultaneously, and a military-style invasion of a private underground complex with explosions happening in reverse. Like we said, even if you do not quite grasp the logic behind it, you can surely appreciate the tentpole artistry in applying 'temporal inversion' to the non-stop action.That almost singular focus on science and kinetics comes at the expense of emotion, and if that is one glaring flaw in 'Tenet', it is that it fails to develop its characters in any meaningful way. The closest one comes to appreciating any of the ensemble is Kat's longing to be reunited with her young son Max, part of the psychological abuse which she endures being in a joyless marriage with Andrei. Yet those looking for the sort of emotional anchor as that which Leonardo DiCaprio's character had with his wife in 'Inception' will come off sorely disappointed, because it isn't clear what Washington is driven by other than to prevent Armageddon.Certainly, those eagerly awaiting the sort of big-scale cinematic spectacle that Nolan is known for since 'The Dark Knight' trilogy will love every minute of 'Tenet'. His blockbuster has been touted as the reason to head back to the cinemas, and let's just say it fully lives up to that promise. What it demands in return is that you embrace its convoluted machinations, including time travel paradoxes, quantum physics and ""temporal pincer movements"" that feed into a palindromic narrative concept; even if you go 'WTF', know that it is part of the experience, an experience which Nolan warns through a character - ""Don't try to understand it, feel it."""
1707,"As a 15 year old kid who's love for film increases for every day Nolan has knocked it out the park again with another masterpiece that I would put above most of his other projects. The cinematography is gorgeous and every shot tells a story its self without having to have dialogue. This is not a story where you can sit back and relax because if you miss any details then this could cause you to get confused and without much exposition this movie will confuse the audience if they aren't paying attention. The back and fourth between Pattinson and Washington is entertaining and there relationship expands through out the movie and every central character is fleshed out enough so we can care about them and fear for there lives. If I had one criticism about the movie, it would be that Branagh's characters motives are clear but they are not understandable. Without spoiling anything, his characters motives feel like Nolan just needed a way to get a villain into the movie and just gave him an evil master plan that didn't really make much sense except show the character was just plain evil. But that's my only problem with the movie and everything else is Nolan at his best, with outstanding action sequences and amazing performances from the leads. This movie will have us thinking for years and will split fans about what everything actually meant."
1708,"A big heavy action movie with a nice script,very good acting and three big action scenes with no cgi very near at a bond level.the only thing I really don't like is the soundtrack too invasive and electonic.So far best movie of the year.voto 10"
1709,Tenet is the big screen movie we all have been waiting for. It is really something else and I cannot wait to watch once again. It is probably one of the hardest movie to give a rating I ever watched.My opinion will maybe be better or worse after a rewatch.8/10Update: I just rewatched it again and it is a masterpiece. All the parts my brain could not catch the first time did actually makes sense the second time. I would highly recommend to watch it more than once.9/10
1710,"I wonder how a serious director can accept to introduce such a strereotypical character as the awful Russian evil, and this is becoming quite usual lately. Of course the child loving mother is British and the heroes that fight backwards (how stupid) are americans. Please, do you think we can all be so easily manipulated??
There is a subtle detail at the beginning, perhaps some of you realized. Instead of the Dobrovka theater in Moscow, it was the Opera in Kiev, but awful policemen gassed the hostages simulating the Russian operation in the real hostage crisis. I think this is useless, cruel, and show poor respect to the Russian people. You really disappointed me, Mr. Nolan."
1711,"Now, if you check out my other reviews and ratings of Christopher Nola's movies, you will understand that I absolutely love his films and great cinematic talent.But I have to be honest with myself and I am not afraid of the future for Mr. Nolan and his future films. Even Steven Spielberg and Francis Ford Coppola have made a few not so good movies.The Tenet is a very, very bad movie. In all aspects. The story is really bad. In fact so bad that I don't understand it. I don't get it what so ever. And Nolan's visual style in this movie feels like he didn't even try. It seems like he was bored with himself and this film, but that said, being a filmmaker myself, he might just have been blinded by issues with the whole production and these things happens, even to the best Film directors.Why do we need a scene with Michael Caine that lasts no more than a minute and a half? Why? Doesn't make sense, not even for the story, the script. It's like Nolan thought to himself that Michale is old and he might die any day now and he wanted his last movie to be his movie.But what really brings this movie down to the most horrible film I have seen in many, many years, besides the story that I don't understand (sorry, I don't understand the Tenet's story) ---- SHALL I REPEAT MYSELF???? What really brings it down are the horrible actions scenes THAT ARE BACKWARDS, because something from the future travels back in time and moves BACKWARDS because it is from the future?????THIS MOVIE IS BAD - BAD - BAD - BADSorry, Nolan, I don't get it and I was almost falling asleep during some of the action scenes. I had to fight hard to keep myself awake and this has never happened to me since watching the stupid long ending scene of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) which I rated with one (1) Star.In fact, I believe the only reason why I rated THE TENET two (2) stars is because I have a deep respect for Mr. Nolan and his work - but NOT this time because I don't get it. Any of it!"
1712,"Style over substance. This movie does make sense in some way but it's to complicated.
Nolan is known for intelligent science fiction but this time he went to far.
The Idea is good but dialogues are from medicore action movie with some scientific mumbo jumbo.
Special effects are good and bad at the same time.
Actors pretending walking forward but they obviously were walking backwards looks weird.
Nolan fell victim to his obsession to not use CGI when it's absolutely necessary. This time CGI would make this movie good.
You can still feel his style throughout the whole movie but it's definitely his worst work."
1713,"Christopher Nolan. He is from another world I guess. Everytime he sets the bar to the next level. When you watch the film for the first time, you're seeing only dots. After watching the film first time watch it again and you'll see the connection between those dots. Phenomenal cinematography. Awesome score. Don't miss the chance. Watch it in Cinema hall to experience the art."
1714,"Trust me it's the best of Christopher Nolan, he gave us something which we can't even imagine to have.. He literally did everything which we can't even imagine to do.. I understood this movie in just one go, all you have to do is to stick with the movie and keep in notice every single frame of the movie.. He taught us reaction, before action!! Just totally worth it..!!Don't know why people rate it bad just because they didn't get to understand what this masterpiece was about.. Don't rate it bad people!!!!"
1715,"The story is good.
Terrible casting for several roles, but great stunts and fighting, which is why I gave it the third star.
John, the lead seems to have been a Hollywood, race-charity, because of the glowing, media praise of the film. His acting is incongruous to several of the other actors.This story is extremely difficult to tell in 2.5 hours.
As a 20 hour series, it could have been good, maybe.If you enjoy having no idea what is going on or why, and random dialogue and fighting are cool, then you might like the movie.
Also, if you like watching movies, many times over, to try and figure out what they are about, this one might be good, because it's probably not possible to figure out.
It's just a slurry of sci-fi concepts, and bad characters. It belongs on the sci-fi channel.If you want a really disjointed, good, movie that throws you for a loop, see ""Memento."""
1716,"Was it a rushed release that caused the massive plot holes and inconsistencies? It looks to me that Nolan was attempting to combine Pulp Fiction and Inception, but he failed badly. Every single part of the movie was great - except for the massive holes in the plot and continuity. This movie proves what Ryan Reynolds said in Deadpool: The Writers Rule. This movie also proves what we all knew before we saw it - there was something not 'right' about this movie. While other movies like Avatar, Iron Man, Intersellar etc. were good before we saw them, this movie was like the ending of Game of Thrones - before we even saw it, we knew something was not right. I do not think that there will be a sequel, despite the ending clearly leaving that option open."
1717,"Boring dialogue, i didn't understand nothing about the actors or the Story, the fact that we watched the same actor doing stupidities in all scenes is boring. 3 stars only for the action scenes."
1718,"Action in every second, great acting, great scenario 🖤"
1719,"The first time I saw this movie I was completely entertained, massively baffled by all the twists I saw but somewhat confused because I couldn't follow up the story closely enough. Needless to say I watched the movie a second time and all my confusion was blown away and replaced with amazement at how Nolan was able to create this movie and plan every single step of the movie from the very begining up until the final poingnant ending. Without a doubt this is one of the, if not the most mind-bending movie ever created, in my opinion at least. So instead of my usual plot breakdown, I'll be going through this movie chronologically, as well as I can. So buckle up 'cause this is going to be rough.So the movie kicks off with the opera prologue. And lets call this moment 0. There the protagonist finds one of the pieces of the algorithm. That is where we first see Neil with his red chord on his backpack. So from here everything goes chronologically culminating with protagonist death, rebirth and hiring in Tenet. He meets Neil for the first time in person and they find out that the person responsible for the inverted objects is Andrei Sator. So protagonist goes to a british contact who will help him reach Sator. So it is here that we get the first temporal clue. It's been two weeks since the opera attack in Kiev. So it is here that Sator disapears from Kat and emerges with inverted objects and starts building his plan to destroy the world with the algorithm. It is also on the same day that Kat sees a woman jumping from his yacht and starts suspecting Sator might cheat on her. It is also here that the algorithm is defused and protagonist and his team stop Sator. So moving forward from this moment (two weeks after Kiev siege) in time, protagonist gets close to Sator and all that stuff, till we get to the freeport scene where Neil and protagonist try to destroy a painting thus lifting Sator's leaverage on Kat. And here things get complicated. Neil and protagonist go into the turnstiles and from them comes out protagonist on his younger version's side inverted and fights with himself while on Neil's side he comes up normal. So at this moment in time, as we find out later, we have two Neils and two protagonists and also two Kats. One of whom is inverted to heal the inverted bullet wound that she gets in the future from Sator. Crazy until now? Hold on, it only gets crazier! So the normal protagonist that escapes Neil goes out of the freeport, signals inverted Neil with Kat to go through the turnstile and revert themselves back to normal and then meets up with normal Neil and Kat who is now almost healed. We will continue that a bit later. Now, the inverted protagonist, we are going to follow him backwards, while following the present day protagonist that fought with his inverted self, normally. So inverted protagonist fights himself gets cut and his wound gets worse in normal flow of time, but because he is inverted from his point travelling back his wound becomes worse until the moment it is created, which is the fight with himself. From here normal flowing protagonist goes even further beyond two weeks past moment 0. He meets with Pryia and finds out about the plutonium 241 which was seen in the prologue and which is now guarded by ukranian security services. So normal flow protagonist meets Sator, saves his life and then goes on the mission to get the plutonium for Sator. Here is where things get a little bit complicated. Inverted protagonist is now going backwards from the ship he was on going back to Oslo, and reaches his trapping inside the car which is blown by inverted Sator after the car chase. All while normal flow Sator beats his wife at the turnstyle and gets in where the normal flow protagonist is being held. So after the yacht, normal flow protagonist goes with Neil and his team to extract the algorithm piece on that truck scene and then they start seeing the grey car going backwards, that being the inverted protagonist. They also see inverted Sator to whom protagonist throws an empty case while throwing the piece into the grey car going backwards. The car chase ends with a shootout and then protagonist is captured by normal flow Sator's people and brought to the turnstile where normal flow Sator was wating for him, while also having the normal team of Sator pick the piece from the grey car based on inverted Sator's info from the past. Before normal flow Sator threatens to shoot him if he doesn't give the location of the plutonium, protagonist sees Kat getting shot by Sator with an inverted bullet. Remember this Kat is in normal flow, picked up by the inverted Sator after the normal one beat her up and carried through the car chase. So normal Kat gets inside the inverted chamber with inverted Sator and she gets the inverted bullet. So after normal Sator threatens protagonist, Neil's team arrive and Sator gets inverted and takes normal Kat bringing her back in the inverted car through the car chase back to where normal Sator left her off. So now we are at the point in time after Sator's inversion. We have normal Kat in an inverted room, that gets brought to the normal room by Neil's team. Then normal flow protagonist inverts with Neil and his team plus Kat in order to have her wound inverted. Here is where it gets really crazy. So from her normal flow of time the wound was made by an inverted object. So now she is bleeding and her wound is as an inverted object inside her. So if an inverted object like a wound gets worse as time goes by, inverting Kat results in inverting the inverted wound which will now go backwards in her resulting in her healing up. Make sense? So here is where everything ties up until this moment in the movie. Remember we are still two weeks after the opera siege and the algorithm defusion. Now we are going to pick up where we last left off, where normal flow protagonist escapes with Neil and Kat whose wound is now a scar. But this happens two days before protagonist's talk with Pryia about the 241. So now we are two days before the car chase. So protagonist talks to Pryia and plans his temporal pincer by meeting with Ives team and inverting to go back two weeks at the same time with the opera heist which was the moment 0. So now we reach the climax of the movie. And here is where it becomes tricky. Protagonist's team split up into 2 parts. One normal flow and one inverted. The one in normal flow has its briefing at point 0, while inverted team has the briefing 1 hour after point 0. So after point 0 going forward in time team red normal flow does the mission while blue inverted team undoes the mission. Here is where Neil improvises while still inverted, when he sees one of Sator's team members planting a bomb. So he inverts and picks protagonist and Ives after they get saved by Neil inverted who dies in order for them to make it out. So in the end when all three escape and split the algorithm we find out that Neil had the backpack with the red chord attached to, and that he had trained with protagonist his entire life and that from this point protagonist begins his side of friendship with Neil. The movie ends with protagonist tying up the last loose end that was Pryia while suggesting also that he might be going further back in time to meet with Neil and start his side of the friendship, until the point where Neil comes to the protagonist.What a complex and fantastic film. From the incredible soundtrack to the excellent acting from most of the cast and to directing and cinematography, this movie is a blast from start to finish, full of twists and turns but also saving the best for the last in Neil's reveal. You know, I think sometimes that people's ability to comprehend movies has significantly decreased in the last decade or so. Many people compared this film with Inception, and while I see how one would do that, I can also say that if that film was to be released around this time it would get the same response as Tenet did. People have gotten used to movies spoon feeding them everything and not trying to do challenging things or to make the audience question themselves, yet alone put pieces together and understand a complex film. And we have to thank the MCU for that. I believe a film like this would have been way better received 10 years ago when people still wanted engaging movies with complex, multi-layered plots. A criticism I often heard about this movie is that it has no emotional core. That might be the most simplistic thing I've ever heard about this movie. This movie's emotional core is the relationship between Neil and protagonist which expands even further than the movie itself and lands an emotional blow right at the end when we find that Neil is going to his death. I felt that the first time I saw this movie in theater and by the second time I saw the movie, tears were filling my eyes. Also what is everyone's problem with the sound design? I watched this in cinema the first time and had no problem understading everything, and second time on PC also understanding everything. As for other criticism, for example about the lack of the main character's name, that is basically done purposefully because he is a new man ever since he dies at the begining of the movie, and because it would be wise that he didn't have a name so that he could see his temporal pincer through to the end. Honestly the only criticism I might have towards the movie is that the first act feels a little choppy with busywork that in a way never has any impact on the plot. I would have liked for the movie maybe to set the rules more elaborately in the begining so it would't be so hard later to follow everything that happens. Ultimately Tenet is a modern masterpiece, a movie so complex and puzzling that it takes multiple viewings to truly appreciate. I certainly did after the second watch, so if you felt somewhat confused after the first viewing, go watch it again, it's a movie meant to be experienced! 10/10"
1720,This film is the proof that All Christopher Nolan movies are not excellent because it's story have to many loopholes and predictable plots.
1721,"Ok film, but it was made overly complicated, it's very hard to watch and for most of the film this is just really annoying.
It's not a film that you would watch again"
1722,"Couldn't really get into it. But i have a low attention span, i tried my best to follow it but half way into it was really bored out of my mind.Yes go ahead and make fun of me for being stupid and probably slow, im just being honest though."
1723,"Overly complicated for no other reason than to extend the time. Music mixing needs a lot of help. This was a complete waste of time. The reverse time logic when traveling into the past is the biggest load of hogwash. Please do not waste your time on this movie, even if you do have 2.5 hours to spare, go and paint a room or something."
1724,"I'm glad for the pandemic that I didn't pay to see it at the cinema. In the first five minutes you realize it's dumb, then it gets dumber. Skipping past the mumbo-jumbo pseudo-science, it's a combination of old Nolan themes, ideas stolen from other movies, childish subplots and some contemporary political correctness. Do yourself a favor and don't waist your time."
1725,"There is a long tradition in regards to the new age of time perception. While we first saw what could possibly happen in a movie like Timecop, ever since Minority Report, we have seen smarter and denser depictions of time travel. Primer showed us how multiple realties can manipulate a time line. Time Crimes and Predestination expertly weaved events being manipulated by our future and past selves. The only problem these films had was the limits of a small budget, and that is when someone like Christopher Nolan comes in. With the pull he commands and a 200 million budget to work with, what we have is all of the best pieces of the previously mentioned films on steroids. And testosterone. And Human Growth Hormones. Hell he has enough chemicals to start a wrestling league.Now Tenet is not going to squash all of those films due to grandeur and scale, but instead will stand next to them as intriguing and incredible takes on how we visualize time and time travel. Nolan has the capability to bringing something new to the table without making it cheap or too dumbed down.Tenet starts with a pulse pounding action scene that is a loving devotion to espionage movies. From there, we see The Protagonist expertly maneuver through a world of intrigue, danger and back door deals. John David Washington has enough cool and physicality to fully encompass the role of The Protagonist, and why would he not? I mean Denzel Washington is his old man! So anyone worrying about a relative no name leading a massive movie like this doesn't need to worry. I actuallly enjoyed the casting choices, for Robert Pattinson played a very understated character and only Kenneth Branagh has a major role who could be considered a known actor besides Pattinson. And this does make me gush a little about Branagh's performance.Someone might say, why this pasty old guy? I will tell you why. Branagh brings rage and power to a role that needed it. We are not afraid of him physically, but we can be afraid of him due to his actions. He will get his hands dirty but that is what you pay henchmen for. It would have absolute pissed me off if he started doing Kung fu moves or had a fight where he was toe to toe with The Protagonist. Thankfully Nolan doesn't believe in such ridiculousness. Needless to say, I really liked the character and considered it a high point.I will say this, be prepared to get your mind warped the first time around. I did not write this review until I had seen it three times. I still have some questions but then again Nolan leaves these laurels to our own imagination without necessarily insulting the audience. But the final fight scene is interesting as hell and difficult to follow the first time, so yeah, watch it a couple more times.This will probably be Nolan's least accessible movie since Following, but will eventually be appreciated later on once the internet gets to dissect the film more thoroughly. Give this film a try. Not because it is the coolest movie in the theaters right now, but because it is just so darn cool to follow and look at."
1726,"A very beautiful movie, but it needs to be understood and every habit is created by director Christopher Nolan"
1727,It is just extra ordinary movie. WB is dumb af. Lets not waste time in writting too much. Just watch it and feel it yourself.
1728,"2 and half hour of pure entertainment. Great music, non-stop action. I would like to see more movies like this one."
1729,"The premise for this movie is certainly intriguing, but I spent the movie trying to understand what the characters were saying. The sound was muffled badly. Maybe if you could understand them you could follow along with the plot. Maybe. Pretty convoluted. I had to find an explanation online afterwards."
1730,"Terrible FX and a horrible script. It wasn't a terrible concept. It was just so cliched. I've read many time travel and time loop related things and seen many movies and TV shows based around the same concept, this was about the worst."
1731,"Okay. My summary for my review is 'confusing', but I gave it 9/10 stars (for me, very high!!), which is confusing in itself. So I gotta say, to clarify, I LOVED this film. I'd watch it again and again... but oh my god, Nolan needs to calm.Let me try and summarise:
The MC, Protagonist (well named, I suppose?) is some agent and he gets captured, tries to kill himself to escape, but ends up escaping without dying. He is now effectively 'dead' but free to work so he gets straight to the technology known as 'tenet', which means something that has been 'inverted', meaning it is working on a backwards timeline to everything else. This could be anything: bullets, cars, even people. Protagonist (I'll be honest I didn't even notice he didn't have a proper name until the very end- I think that was the intended effect?) is told that this technology is basically being used to create a super nuke that will kill everyone. That's bad and he's good, so he must prevent the whole world dying. Cue about 1.5 hours of our main character getting some allies, crashing a plane on purpose, meeting some blonde lady who is chained to her psychopath rich husband, fighting, getting inverted, more fighting and then that's where we reach the ending, where the whole plot forms into a cycle that really satisfies us as an audience.In terms of characters and plot, I was extremely happy. The plot, as I said, is satisfying. But, it's also exciting and there's twists and turns- even if you're have no clue what's going on, you can still appreciate the excitement. The characters! Were! Also! Amazing! (I'm a teenager to clarify) I'm not going to lie, I thirsted over most of the characters: the MC, Kat, Neil, the lady from India and the scientist lady who was in Harry Potter. While they were all very, very attractive, they were also very multi dimensional; Protagonist, Neil and Kat most of all. Acting was also really good. I don't think there was a moment where I judged an actor/actress except Kenneth Branagh made me laugh a little, but his acting wasn't necessarily bad.To conclude, in three words, Tenet is confusing, satisfying and exciting. It really did it for me. That being said, my original rating was a 7.5/10, then I watched it again and I bumped it up to a 9/10. If you've watched it only once- watch it again. (The worst thing about this film is the sheer intricacy and watching it again lessens it's effects.)It's sad that Tenet is a flop since it's such a good film, but I think Nolan will survive. Most of all I hope cinema will return to its former greatness. Anyway, if you haven't watched this, please watch it! It's amazing!"
1732,"Sheer spectacle with great effects, dragging on with a mind numbing ammount of techno-babble and deadpan acting, all built around a great and sometimes worthwhile idea of ""inverted"" ammunition and ordinance.The action was fun, and the effects/sets were great, but on the whole my biggest problem with the film wasnt the confused plot, but the fact that most of the film wasProtagonist: -_- ""We have to protect reality.""Supposed to be a loving mother: -_- ""I love my son, he is my everything.""Rob pattinson aka: the most emotive actor in the film
:D ""you have a future in the past!!"""
1733,"I love scifi. I really like time travel. But hey, this is a bad version of Groundhog Day and the confusion of The Sting. You walk out saying, what the heck did I just see?? while your brain tries to process the mismatch of plot you just watched. Some scenes you watch are interesting, like backward explosions while soldiers run thru the scene. In short, after the first 30 mins of trying to figure out what the movie is about, the last 30 mins make you feel-- it could have been better!!"
1734,And that's about it. The film doesn't make sense to me. The hype about this film sucked me in and I don't want to keep watching it for it to make sense to me.
1735,"Coming out of this there were so many logistical details I had questions about but never mind them. Other people will talk about them.OK, imagine Inception but more so. That's this movie. Even louder, even more convoluted, even more dense.I didn't hate this or anything, but it's a 150 minute movie I think and I feel that it would have worked a bit better at just 120. It's rather adorable to see Nolan try to recreate Inception (which was really just Paprika in muted colors anyway but I didn't mind it).Back to this movie though: was I the only one who was surprised by how little ""Tenet"" has to do with anything? From the trailers I thought it was all about some kind of shadowy government but it's actually about some kind of retrochronological mechanism.Never mind the plot or the characters. if you're focused on that you don't get the point of this movie. It's a fun action movie with plenty of neat effects, set pieces and general action movie badassdom even if there is maybe too much of...everything (except coherence). The protagonist has really no motivation beyond his job. He was assigned to the the role and now we're stuck with him.Kenneth Brannagh makes a delicious villain. I wasn't even sure it was him for the most part. Though i do wish they'd used an actual Russian. The only other really compelling character is Robert Pattinson's character. Why wasn't he the hero? He was so much more fun.I just let this movie wash over me and didn't question it and I suggest you don't either. Like, half the movie is talk and explanations which felt like twice as much as good story telling should have and yet there still feels like there was still half as much explanation as we needed (I worked on that line a lot...).Overall I feel like they were just throwing idea after idea and only stopped because they met a runtime limit. It doesn't feel like a solid piece of story telling and I guess it was never supposed to.The ending isn't that hard to understand though."
1736,"The latest thriller from Christopher Nolan is a sprawling, international-scale spy film about a mercenary who is charged with the daunting task of preventing world destruction through a complex time loop. Handsomely shot, with imposing cinematography, globe-trotting locations and flamboyant visual effects, this film has the look and feel of Nolan's best work. The underlying concept at work here is labyrinthine to say the least.If you've seen any of Nolan's previous two or three films, then you are on notice about some of his more unique foibles as a director, some of which he majorly doubles down on in this one. From a highly intricate plot concerning time intervals to his puzzling penchant for scenes with unintelligible dialogue to his flare for thundering climactic sequences, this is the most Nolan-esque film I have ever seen. Everything I've come to know about him as a director, I saw here in abundance. That's both good news and bad.When the dialogue is incomprehensible as often as it is here, it's difficult to get invested in what's taking place. Here more than in any of his other films, Nolan allows this peculiar, noisy style of acoustics to pervade, which prevents us from connecting with the protagonists. The difficulty in even hearing what's being said is a flaw that Nolan allows to interfere with the storyline much too often. As for the special effects, they are exceptional even though toward the end, I found myself desensitized to their impact and growing impatient with the pacing.I cannot fault the performances. John David Washington, the spy at the heart of the assignment, is even more of a presence in this film than he was in BlacKkKlansman. Kenneth Branagh is a seething, formidable villain and Elizabeth Debicki is quite persuasive as the damsel-in-distress. Robert Pattinson is slightly under-utilized as Washington's partner, but quite compelling nonetheless. Michael Caine's part here amounts to little better than a cameo appearance. But all their acting chops can only do so much with a script that is at times lumbering, often disorienting and a bit too distant to truly resonate in any emotional way. If you let your mind wander even a little bit, you might lose your way. I always admire Nolan's eagerness to tackle challenging concepts in an exciting manner. Unfortunately here, it's possible that he might have bitten off more than he could chew. The end result is a film to be studied, if not necessarily adored. Recommended to those who are patient and open to repeat viewings."
1737,"It was the only thing showing. I thought long and hard if really wanted to do it. A 2.5 hour Nolan movie I knew exactly what i was getting in to.
Nolan is truly a visionary in film but like some genres of music, Nolan films just aren't for me in the theater.I couldn't spoil the movie if I tried because I really cannot tell you what happened. The plot was out of reach for me and I couldn't keep track of who/when/what was going. I will pay to see it again (not in a theater) It will take multiple viewings to dissect. On my first viewing I would best describe TENET as that song you like because of the riffs and bassline but have no idea what the lyrics are."
1738,"Don't listen to the haters. I am a dedicated Nolan fan and expected this movie to make me think. This is why you go watch his movies - if you want an easy to understand flick that will make you relax, go watch something else.The music is loud and is made to make you feel the action, which it did. The dialogue was hard to hear at times which makes you have to pay even more attention to what was going on. I dare to say I was confused for the first 20 minutes but then caught on. I knew I would have to watch it again, and just like Inception or Interstellar, you understand more of the science and dwell deeper into the discussion points. Someone else said here that you need to talk after a Nolan movie and that is so true. My family and I debate all the storylines for hours afterward.Watch it a few times. It's worth it."
1739,"I remember people complaining that Matrix Reloaded was too over the top, too loud, too ""complicated"" for its own good while not neccessarily intelligent, where the creators wanted too stretch concepts found in their earlier movie(s) to some extreme. I kind of feel the same way about Tenet after having watched it the first time. The introduction of the concept of inverted objects had novelty to it, but was way too underused later in the movie and played more of a gimmicky role at times, replaced by the focus on inverted persons and time travel concepts, time loops and paradoxes already dealt with in plenty of movies such as 12 Monkeys and even Harry Potter. One of my major concerns was also that I never really picked up on the character's motives, which means that the character development felt lacking. Some choices made by the characters made me think of the old scary movie cliche of the victim walking around asking out if someone is there, instead of just being rational.. But my main concern about the movie is that if you try to decribe the plot in a few sentences you realise how unsatisfying the overarching story is. If you do the same with any other Nolan movie, you can easily describe an intriguing story. The movie is still an experience though, and I believe that I will appreciate it a bit more after the second viewing. I just feel that it had so much more potential, being Nolan and all."
1740,"On first viewing I will agree with many that the movie is a little difficult to follow . It's a demanding watch on plenty of levels . Where Interstellar and Inception both spent plenty of time throughout the film introducing the science behind it all Tenet ignores it , mostly . They do spell out the concept in a couple of brief scenes but then abandon any science in favour of action .There is plenty of relentless high voltage action if that's your thing and some genuine stunt work was great to see but it all becomes a little pointless if you don't really understand why it's all happening .If you don't like it really loud take some ear plugs . The score is thundering but a little overused for my liking . It is accomplished and brilliant film making but my first impressions were that I just didn't enjoy it as much as some of his previous films . I'll start with a 7 but I believe it has the potential to grow on me . It is a visual treat that's for sure ."
1741,"The first movie after the cinemas reopening had to be Nolan's out of few reasons: first, it is a Cristopher Nolan movie; second, it's a movie about time travelling; third, it's a movie not about time travelling. Complex storytelling, stunning visuals, grandiose musical score and outstanding performances are the main reasons you'd want to go see a Nolan movie - so what does Tenet have out of those? The narrative is complex alright but once you unravel, unwind and rewind your own mind you'll find the whole story too easy and its world, although multi-dimensional but still as flat as your ex's chest. The visual component though is absolutely perfect and you catch yourself staring at the screen in amaze many times. I don't know why didn't Chris work with Hans Zimmer on this one but it is visible (or to be precise hearable) from the get-go: music at times is just too darn loud and unfitting which disappointed a lot. As for acting the only weak link in Tenet is Kenneth Branagh whose theatrics, over the top dramaticality and godawful attempt at russian accent made me forget almost completely what a great actor he really was; maybe he just didn't get the material he had to work with. Overall the movie feels fresh visually and despite the runtime of 150 minutes holds your attention firmly but when it comes to the whole point of the matter and what this little world is all about it doesn't feel right to be invested in rewatching the movie again because apart from a few scenes there's just not much you'll leave in your memory as soon as you walk out of the movie theater."
1742,"First of all, I must say that Tenet is well worth your time. It's a good, solid, spy thriller with a bit of twist on time travel. However, it seems that the movie struggles a bit with the intelligence of its intended audience. The most disappointing thing to me was that I correctly guessed all of the ""twists"" in the plot long before they were revealed. The script just seemed a bit naive and ham-handed in that respect... they were just too obvious. Maybe I've just seen too many ""time travel"" movies. I knew how the movie was going to end about 30 minutes in, and I think a lot of other people will, too. Definitely don't watch ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" prior to seeing Tenet, if you haven't already seen it, as a lot of the same concepts are re-hashed.On the bright side, it is an engaging movie. The performances of John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, and Elizabeth Debicki are solid. Washington does a great job of portraying a ""newbie"" intelligence agent... at first you think it's just bad acting, then you realize it's part of the character. It was great to see Pattinson in an intelligent, adult role... and he does quite well in it."
1743,"I prefer the first two works, the theme is not so clear"
1744,"I love this movie and the brilliant screenplay. Perfect camera, director, actors, screenplay and locations. Best intelligent film I've ever seen."
1745,"Liked it. I've herd that it is not very easy to watch so i paid a lot of attention in movies. Didn't get lost and must say, really enioyed. Allso, because im from Estonia, it was good to look our streets in such awesome movie :)"
1746,"The confusion and rush are just catalyst to go with.
a entire protagonist is named protagonist without even mentioning the name in the movie, that level of rush and detailing is given in this movie.
Dash of Sci-fi make's it fun and logical
And the effort of Actors and directions provided by director.
Just great"
1747,The movie was absolutely fantastic and fabulous it was thrilling experience there was a little sound problem but overall it was fantastic and mind blowing 10 by 10 from me never seen action before 👍👍 hope they fix sound problem in remastered version
1748,"Tenet film review: if back to the future and terminator had a baby, then that baby grew up to be a schizophrenic, Crystal meth addict........yip that would be a pretty accurate analogy of this movie. My mind is in ruins"
1749,"From the beginning to the end, the movie grabs your mind with all the things that happen. music is a great point, it is excellent and transmits all the sensations that pass, all tension.
All cast is perfect and have the time to shine.
The history is so interesting and original, maybe you will need rewatch the film to understand all.
The photography and lights, in addition to music is the characteristic style of cristopher nolan.
In conclusion the film is awesome and it night break your mind"
1750,"I was immediately hooked by the concept and the characters. The intro scene is amazing. The two mains work together so well and are perfectly casted.I don't know how to explain it, but it just felt lacking compared to its heady cousin Inception. It made what could have been a cool and simple idea into something convoluted. The main mechanic of the film is truly something to behold, but Tenet gets caught up in trying to make sense of it all instead of just letting the idea run.The set pieces elevate what should have been a masterpiece of storytelling. In the end, I was left dejected because of needless big brain talk. Show don't tell is a saying for a reason"
1751,"After months of anticipation, Christopher Nolan's TENET is finally in theaters. But after walking out, I'm not really sure what it was trying to be. It was a mixture of disappointment and confusion.TENET has great set pieces. The action and in-camera stuff is top-tier Christopher Nolan. This movie will be remembered for that. The acting is also top-tier. Robert Pattinson and John David Washington give great performances. The story has unique elements that are far more original than 99% of movies being released today.Unfortunately, this movie has a lot of bad too. For one, the plot is WAY to confusing to be understood by the average viewer. For the first hour, my brain was using 100% of its capacity to follow the story. Characters go to many places, do many things, and talk to many people with little explanation of why or how. Nolan did this in Memento, but it made sense later in that movie. I kept telling myself, ""Just enjoy the movie. It will make sense later,"" but it never did. That was partly because I couldn't understand a word characters were saying in an IMAX surround sound theater. I plan on buying this on Blu-ray, and turning on closed captions. Maybe then it will make sense, but as of now, it did not.What really broke my experience was the time twist in the 2nd act. I was already using 100%, but I was pushed to 110%. At that point, I gave up trying to analyze it. There were some really good ideas done with the time twist, but they fell flat when trying to figure out what was going on. The final act was messy because we knew what would happen if the characters didn't succeed, but we didn't care for them succeeding.TENET has very little character development. Kat is the most developed character, but our two leading men don't have traits. The movie doesn't slow down to explain the plot or the characters, but the dialogue mixing is part of the issue.In conclusion, TENET gave me a Nolan movie, but not the Nolan movie I wanted. I had very little character development, an unnecessarily confusing plot, and awe-inspiring set pieces that will hopefully make more sense with closed captions. I recommend seeing this movie for the spectacle, but don't expect another Inception.7.5/10."
1752,"Tenet uses the burmerang effect of time delineation very similar to Nolan's previous film Momento. But time is dependent on the plot, which comes primarily through the free-will of the character's choices. Nolan's cast, especially Robert Pattinson, are outstanding, and the characters are fewer than in Inception, allowing for more development. A fast paced film which combines elements from the Bourne Series, Momento (as previously mentioned), and the video game Call of Duty. An enjoyable viewership. What the film lacks however is a stronger enough reason for why the characters do what they do. In the moment choices seem reasonable, given usually the lack of time to plan, and rather react, but after coming away I felt like movies such as The Dark Knight and Inception gave us the emotional anxiety of what these characters had to loose. Tenet however felt more like a Marvel film, if things didn't work out there's always time travel...or sorry, inversion."
1753,"New shot New toys. New idea.
But no perfect movie.
I feel have new world!"
1754,Tenet is an actionpacked movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat. There's no dull moment in the film. Every action scence is done really well. The cinematography is well done. The concept and story is great. On top of this there's a wonderful score. A lot of people said they had trouble hearing it but I personally didn't. The film is confusing and could need some more expostion. But as you have time to think about it more things make sense. I look foward to rewatching it to understand it more and I bet it will be better on rewatch. The movie has some flaws most notably the protagonist isn't a good charcter. There's no depth or motivation with him. I enjoyed this film but for me the protagnist needed more depth to be one of the best Nolan movies. Overall very good movie though.
1755,"I've seen a lot of the criticism of this film and can understand it, the dialogue is sometimes difficult to hear, the story is not the easiest to follow but I loved it.
All the actors do a fantastic job, the cinematography is amazing, the action scenes are top notch and the two and a half hours fly by.
The one thing I would say is this film needs to be seen on a big screen with no distractions as yoy need to be focused in what is going on to follow it, it is not a small screen film that you can watch indoors, or at least I couldn't because I would be distracted by my phone or the kids or the cats, it needs your full undivided attention and maybe even a couple of viewings but it is well made and I thoroughly enjoyed it, I may even rewatch it again this week myself"
1756,"The actions scenes in this movie are just insane! It is a really difficult movie to understand, but once you do understand it, it becomes a masterpiece.
I suggest to watch this movie at least 2 times, it really deserves a rewatch.
Nolan is such a great filmmaker!"
1757,"I think I would happily give this film full marks 10/10 when they sort out the mix. There are points where dialogue in this film is inaudible, that's why I feel like I've missed so much crucial exposition (there's lots) motivations (not so much) and crucial sciencey stuff that pushes this epic along.It's a truly stunning film visually. I wish more care had been taken to make it at least comprehensible audibly. It's Bane all over again!"
1758,Apart from good sound effects that caused some thrill you may feel yourself quite lost in the script and dialogues. The scenes are too far-fetched as well as the plot that we kept asking if it wasn't in cooperation with Indian production.
1759,"I thought this film had some incredibly clever and intricate plot lines, but to me, I thought that whilst following one it was hard to be truly invested in another. I think perhaps if I watched it again I might feel differently, but to me I felt multiple movies were playing over each other."
1760,The pace of the movie won't allow any character to develop. So you have the british white coat scientist and of course the Rusian-wodka drinking bad guy. The dialoges are one-liners.The story is very interesting but the pace of the movie is really annoying. It kind of feels like a James Bond meets CSI on steroïds. Not a fan.
1761,"First of all, i went into this movie blindly, didn't read plots or reviews, the hype was definitely there. All i can say is that Christopher Nolan did an outstanding job, such an extraordinary movie, it was unique in every way, definitely original, with so many interesting and surprising plot points. The movie was mind bending and perplex, with an outstanding atmosphere, music was fully on point, and made the stunning and ascetically pleasing scenes even better, he even made the ""Protagonist"" extremely bad ass.I was a tad bit disappointed in the beginning but fully satisfied at the end."
1762,"Ladies and gentlemen,(Spoiler alert. If you want to skip spoilers then don't read the bullet points part)I am simply shocked! I mean, I get why many private corporation platforms would rate this film highly (because they probably get paid to do so) but i really don't understand how SO many people and independent critics are giving this movie such a high rating. Honestly, this is one of the worst movies I've ever watched at this calibre of a movie.Now to set the premise, i have never posted my thoughts or ratings about a movie, ever. But this movie triggered such a disappointment in me, that now its transcended to anger for wasting my time and never getting those two and a half hours of my life back. Hence, I am compelled to share the truth and try to de-wheel the bandwagon of pro-Tenet group-think that exists simply because of what we like from Nolans previous work. The worst part is that this will continue to waste my time because of all the mixed reviews that will encumber social content online and more unfortunately, in real life for weeks to come.
Now, before i sound just like another cynical critic bashing a movie for attention, i will share a couple of good points. The cinematography, actions and music were great when rated individually.Notice that I started a new paragraph because out of respect to some of Nolands previous work, that last statement lingering for the half-breath in your mind before you started this paragraph is all the time of day I wish to spend praising this movie. Even still, those positives don't carry much weight these days when you have a big budget like this movie obviously did.The movie started strong with powerful action and a with a storyline that was unique and thought-provoking as to be expected by Nolan. Although this initially captured my interest and attention, it was unfortunately unable to hold it. Nolan could not effectively explain the pseudo science and concepts well, spending a majority of the movie trying and failing to do so. In addition to this, i feel that the overbearingly loud, suspenseful music had overspilled to most of the movie to induce the feeling of being on the edge of your chair with tension, anxiety and anticipation probably to compensate on both the lack in plot and character development.Next, the actors. Almost all the reviews i have seen about this point hypes and applaud them for their performance. In reality, they all fell short and in particular, John Denzel. (No pun intended)
As the protagonist, the director reached for a character that was supposed to be a cross between Bourne-cold and Bond-smooth which I felt Denzel could not deliver on and I also felt absolutely no connection to him or any of his motives throughout the whole movie. Although this was primarily due to weak character development on the directors part, his acting totally flatlined, being unemotional and unenthusiastic. There was also a blind-siding scene at the end where he surprisingly squeezed out tears probably to recoup but by that point was just out of character and non-sensical.Next, Kenneth Branagh who was shooting for a rich, ruthless and sinister Russian villian. Although he acted his script as well as anyone could have done, it ruined his character for me through a couple of underwhelming scenes which I personally thought were quite comical, albeit unintentionally so. In particular, at the light dinner party scene, where his very eerie and calm character ended up giving the protagonist a very heavy and inventively murderous death threat that was so easily defused by what could be described as a four word pick-up line. In addition, it worked so well, it had the protagonist not only set free but invited to a hydrofoil sailing session the next day to explain himself on. All I could think was, but why? With a deep frown and light-bulb screw hand twist gesture.Additionally, another scene that was supposed to add to his villainous character development was where he was about to belt-beat his wife, creatively threading his shirts cufflinks in the last holes of the belt as if to showcase that he is a tier of sophistication above the average wife-beater. A few words uttered by his wife lead to an anti-climatic scene. Again, very heavy on the threat but so easily diffused. In a nut shell, I just thought this guy is all fart and no poo.Moving on, Debicki was probably the only character you could feel any sympathy for Her and Pattinson arguably did the best job in terms of acting their scripts out but even then, there was too much going on in the movie to fully appreciate their underdeveloped character, (Pattinsons more-so than Debickis.)In addition to the music, plot, script and actors, there were also inconsistencies and rookie director moves in the film which always grind my gears when you notice them like:***SPOILER ALERT START****
Why do scenes transition so quickly and dive straight into the heavy dialogue even when traveling across countries. Clear horizon swoops and labelling of the cities would definitely help.Sailing scene: how did all characters seemingly from different walks of life just know how to hydrofoil sail at really high speeds nonetheless from one scene to the next which is clearly a very technical and endeavour? Also why were they having such a serious discussion in such an unfitting and loud environmentWhy werent they breathing oxygen in some of the inverted scenes?Why was the protagonist shooting himself when he knew it was himself?How can only one man push, not one, but several pallets full of gold bars weighing tonnes of kilograms in just seconds so easily?Why were people getting knocked out so pathetically and instantly in so many action and fight scenes across the movie. E.g the theatre scene at the beginning, everyone in the audience passed out instantly only seconds from what looked like helium released from gas tanks for ballons into the vents whereas the terrorists took ages to get their masks on but didnt pass out.there was a flimsy chokehold somewhere in India that knocked out one of the guards very quickly tooThe impregnable vault scene having so many thick walls, levels and secured doors and systems to protect its clients assets which by the end had only a flimsy shutter that was keeping it from the outside open carpark and airport where the airbus was in flames outside.***SPOILER ALERT FINISH****All in all, Nolan seems to have reached too far on this one, relying more on action and concept rather than clarity and characters. Even though it was 2.5 hours, there was unnecessarily too much action rushed and squeezed in and not enough invested for both character and plot development. This left me feeling lost in what the characters were exactly doing, why and how they were doing it. Moreover, I just didn't care either because i didn't feel emotionally invested and even considered leaving the theatre a couple of times. i am pretty good at ""getting it"" with complex movies but is is surely one of those movies that you need to watch again to catch things you missed the first time. However, I dont think i can stomach the torture to sit through it again and quite frankly, i dont think Nolan deserves it. My best shot is to read reviews online when i eventually feel up to it. Until then, im going to have to stick with venting my thoughts and grounding the guys on the thumbs-up parade.
To the rest of you who have yet to see it, good luck."
1763,"I had been excited to see this movie coming out and went to see the movie today.....and I am disappointed.The story is extremely complex without any clear explanation. The time travel concept is not that difficult to understand, but with the elements of the movie, it becomes like the modules we learn when we are pursuing a Doctor's degree. If there were a test for this movie, I would get a D. The cinematography and score are still at the same level, but the storytelling is the worst compared to every Nolan's films. The movie is long, so I was waiting for a more comprehensive explanation, but there is none. It's like the characters did whatever they wanted without telling you their motives and why they did it, and sometimes a few concepts seemed contradictory to what we learned in the first place.If you want to comprehend the whole movie, you need to rent a DVD after it is released, pause it every 10 minutes, discuss with your friends and family, get the most convincing conclusion, and continue it will take you a lot of time to fully accept the core concept of the movie and be convinced."
1764,It was a good Twilight Zone style idea stretched into a film. Didn't care for any of the 2D characters and frankly any algorithm that would end this creation would have been a blessed relief. Clever action sequences don't mean anything without a story and characters that engage you.
1765,"Imagine studying PhD level physics at a night club in the middle of a war zone and everytime you begin to make sense of things, the lecture goes back in time. Essentially, Tenet is a spy movie about some agents trying to stop a global catastrophe. One thing that makes it unconventional is Christopher Nolan and his infinite creativity and skill as a filmmaker.Tenet is a meticulously crafted movie that utilizes every single second of it's run-time to create a packed experience unlike anything that has ever been attempted on screen. The film starts off with a deafening bang and a disorienting sequence of events. After that, it just keeps ramping up the pace in terms of information, action and effects. The colossal scale of this movie is unreal whether it is the practical effects, sound or locations. The action sequences are mind boggling in both creativity and execution.Christopher Nolan has never been a director to spoon-feed the audience and here, he simply threw away the spoon. At first, the complexity of it all seems so overwhelming as he keeps throwing information and action at you with minimal explanation and the characters discussing it doesn't make it any simpler. It's only after you actually see a few things, the events begin to make sense and when some of it finally clicks, the feeling is extraordinary.Tenet is Nolan's most complex film and it is humanly impossible to understand everything and connect all the dots in one watch. However, in the end, it is a movie and not a physics documentary. The key is not to try to grasp every little detail of time manipulation but to go with the flow and by the end you will have it figured out. Much like Inception this is a film that requires multiple viewings to get the full picture so I am definitely going back in a week to catch up on details, relive the entire experience and possibly bump it to 10/10.
P.S. A special request from my heart is to watch this movie in IMAX if you are able to. I don't get any shares from ticket sales, just want you to enjoy this movie the way it is meant to be.Movies.shmovies on Instagram"
1766,"I mostly enjoyed this film but was also quite exhausted by the end of it. I'm not sure it would be possible for anyone to watch this film and understand it first time round, or I suspect ever. That's because it's so ridiculously complicated, probably doesn't actually make sense on multiple levels and the simultaneous moving forward while traveling backward in time thing makes utterly no sense in any conceivable way. But are they actually moving backward in time? Or is inverse entropy (or whatever its called) something completely different? Who knows. It really is rather impossible to understand. And I think that's the big big problem with this film. It's central concept is way too complex to understand.But at least Nolan still manages to make an epic action packed spectacle of it all. It does (very) roughly make enough sense that you can just about pretend to follow it that you can still enjoy it. Just about. But i found myself very frustrated (and feeling stupid) that I couldn't really grasp what was going on most of the time. It really doesn't help matters when the dialogue is frequently difficult to make out.One other big flaw that really impacted the enjoyment for me was the actual action sequences that involved the simultaneous backward and forward time interplay. They just weren't enjoyable to watch. Again because you are trying so hard to understand what is going on that you can't let yourself enjoy it. It's just all so mentally taxing! The final 'epic' battle scene at the end just exhausted the life out of me and I really wanted it to be over quickly.The three main actors are very watchable particularly Pattison and Debicki. Washington is a very cool and suave lead. The most affecting element of the plot is the relationship between Debicki and Brannagh. Love gone very very sour and dangerous. I also really enjoyed the scenes between the Indian actress and Washington. I could actually hear what they were saying too!I also enjoyed the score. It really pumped up the adrenaline to go with the action. Han Zimmerman is getting a little samey these days so this new 'epic electronic' guy really works much better.So yeah it's another great grand ambitious conceptual piece of eye candy from Nolan. But perhaps he needs to tone down the complexity for the next one. For all us average intelligence people."
1767,"Nolan directed bars a high, after both interstellar and inceptio. Despite that bar this film was over it. I though it was a phenomenal film, both script, actors and alla categories. It was a perfect movie for Pattison to show his new start in acting, he really shined in this movie.When you talk about the movie, everything work perfect. Action scenes amazing songs and themes.At the end you learn alot of parts through out thd movie. How the protagonist was the mind behind it, but his future self sent back neil to help him past time. Still there are so many questions, thats the classic Nolan film, where you really need to work you brain. That's why you really need to see the movie atleast 2 times before really getting the best feeling, still its a 10/10 for me.I recommend everyone to go see itPersonally my two favorite scene was where the protagonist fought a man in revert. We later find out that the protagonist tough his future self in the past from his perspective. It went together perfect."
1768,"Interesting to see several people suggesting this film is much better second time around. For a Nolan movie I was disappointed. There was grand spectacle and fun 'aha' moments but I was never sold on the premise, the threat, or people's motivations, plus the audio was terribly hard to understand as much of the important exposition is delivered through masks. Hopefully better on repeat, but for now this sits above only Insomnia in my Nolan list."
1769,One of the worst I have seen in years. Terrible sound so dialogue can't be understood. Plot so convoluted that it was impossible to follow. Really self-indulgent on part of Nolan. Very disappointing. Actually insulting that so obviously didn't care whether viewers could enjoy the movie. Terrible movie!
1770,"This movie is only benefiting from nothing else being in theaters, and Christopher Nolan being the director. The acting is subpar, and the plot is extremely hard to follow."
1771,"A movie that continuously shouts to the spectator ""shut up, don't think and let me show you what happens next. See? Wasn't it smart, coherent and cool?""First, Time-travel is hard to handle as a narrative device. Second, the suspension of disbelief needs to be handled with care too.
The movie refuses to care about both areas, focusing on a plot so forced that every ""surprise"" feels like a cheap, arbitrary event, ending included.
Additionally, the poor handling of the time travel defeats its very purpose: it deprives every action of its meaning and almost instantly kills any interest in following the movie.
Finally:
dialogues are really poormost action scenes are just confusingly directed, particularly the last scenesall combined, the movie is extremely boringdefenders of the movie focus on saying ""let it sink for a bit to understand it"" which is false: there is nothing to understand, it's just a poor plot masked to seem smart.Do yourself a favour and avoid it."
1772,"Much of the dialogue was undecipherable, perhaps as much as 30% It wouldn't have been much worse just watching a blank screen for two hours with audible dialogue. This is a theme in the reviews to the point that the guardian even wrote an article about it.
The whole film kind of felt like the fx guys just discovered a new technique and wrapped a film around it to showcase it. It was wasted in this film, sadly.
I gave one extra star for the idea, and one for the action.
If you must watch it, wait for the dvd release where you can at least activate subtitles."
1773,"It was just waste of time for me , i preferred to sleep those w hours than watch this movie 🤢🤢🤢"
1774,"I consider myself a reasonably intelligent person, and I love scifi-movies, but I didn't understand a thing of what the hell was going on in this movie. Sure, something with people from the future playing people in the present by ""inversing"" persons or things or situations in time, a villain who tries to use this to annihilate the whole world and a hero who's gonna prevent this. But all the sparsely disseminated info on the what's, who's and why's was totally incomprehensible mumbojumbo to me, and all the goings-on totally eluded my modest brain.This was all the more a pity, since cinematographically this actually is a very entertaining movie. The action-scenes were spectacular, as were the special effects, the settings and locations were impressive and the acting was great: I loved John David Washington, tough, tender and authoritative
at the same time (wouldn't he make a great 007?!), Robert Pattinson was a real surprise in his intriguing role and Elizabeth Debicki is not only a classic beauty but also a very talented actress.But alas, this is not enough to make for a good movie, I would say that an understandable and coherent story is a basic necessity. If not, what remains is a case of much impressive and entertaining ado about nothing."
1775,I watched this with my 16yr old son.We both said pretty much the same.Exceptionally complicated to the point of making it unwatchable. I love films with a twist but unfortunately this just doesn't do it for me.
1776,"I liked the movie, it was a perfect Nolan movie, all of his movies are so good. Went to see it on cinema in English (I live in Europe but I always see the movies in original version, I hate Dubs) and even if I read the subtitles sometimes, I understood the dialogue. I didn't find the audio as bad mixed as everyone says. Anyway the movie was really good, need to watch it again to understand some parts of the plot that were a bit confusing. But Nolan is such a genius, this was the perfect movie for this summer and maybe the best 2020 movie, at least for the moment.John Washington was a delightful surprise, Robert Pattinson was excellent, Elisabeth Debicki did a good job as well, Michael Cane even if he had 2 seconds of screen time he always fits in a Nolan movie, Kenneth Branagh, I prefer him as a director than as an actor, he didn't convince me that much but he was fine.The plot, I'm entering into spoilers territory here, was really good, during most of the movie I thought it was even more confusing than other Nolan movies and I wasn't enjoying as much as I usually do. But towards the end the mysteries were explained and most of confusion became clear (just most, I need to watch it again because still there are things I didn't understood, specially about Kenneth Branagh's character, they couldn't kill him but in the end they do, but then they manage to change time? Or not?).Lots of bad reviews state that even if it is as good as many Nolan films, it lacks character. This may be true, TDK trilogy, Interstellar, Inception or The Prestige gave us perfect character development, and maybe Tenet doesn't have that much, but for me at least I saw some. Elisabeth Debicki's character had an interesting arc, it was nothing new but it was interesting enough, The Protagonist changed a lot throughout the movie and Neil (Robert Pattinson), along with perfect acting, gave us the most human scene in the movie when he says goodbye and he has to go back. I found out that he died before he said that he had to go back, I recognized him when he died early and I had noticed the orange rope in his backpack.So the movie was definitely good for me, Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite filmmakers, he delivers the audience smart movies with excellent writing and excellent actors, and he didn't disappoint me at all with this one."
1777,"Nolan is trying to be as confusing as possible because this has given good results in the past.
This movie is just too much of everything to be enjoyable, it is a pure act of arrogancy where he is relying on past success to sell a poor idea covered by a lot of special effects (really good ones and Oscar deserving, btw)."
1778,"Christopher Nolan has been a fan of the 007 series for years. Tenet is his version of the spy genre. It's got most Bond films got: the plot intertwines various countries, a luxurious lifestyle with grand scenery and visceral action sequences. It doesn't have the series trademark sensuality, though.His unique twist is, like most Nolan pictures, the manipulation of time. Unlike Dunkirk it doesn't have various timeframes, but twisting time and having fun with it is a big pry of Tenet. Just as most Nolan films it is a bit too confusing with a single seating, especially for children. Unfortuately this picture, probably because of the 150-minute runtime limit, is all information with little breathing room.Although this film has little depiction of sensibility, its depiction of violence is pretty intense. There are some suggestive moments of torture. Trigger warning for a portrayal of domestic violence.Despite the MPAA rating not having strong language, there is one F-bomb in an emotionally intense scene. Take note.Overall an enjoyable picture, but not the Nolan's best. A bit too intense violence for children under 14 years."
1779,"Lot's of action, very confusing storyline. If you like plenty of slam bam wallop this is the film for you . I like my movies to keep me on the edge of my seat , this movie did not do that."
1780,Its long and full of scenes without sense. A waste od time. Literally.!!!!
1781,"The appreciation of Nolan's films is fast turning into a Pavlovian cult, with his fans convinced that even a film as monumentally bad as Tenet is a masterpiece.It is not that the plot is complex. There is logic to the time loop plotting. The problem is that plot mechanics do not on their own make for great storytelling. Other more conventional things like character development, wit, scene structure, humour and coherent action have value.I liked Dunkirk. That is where his penchant for cross-cutting (and apparent fear of linear sustained scene building) came into its own. But Tenet takes all his worse tendencies and indulges them to create a profoundly empty experience."
1782,"First off... loud. So loud. Secondly, you could've actually turned up the volume on the actors speaking so I could hear them try to explain this jumbled storyline (this movie could've used TARS to run down the entire plot at the end like he did for Interstellar lol). I get what Nolan was trying to do here. He rarely starts a film where anything makes sense and you just have to keep watching to figure it out. So I dont think it's that the plot is overly complicated. I just think Nolan doesn't show you enough to let it sink in, or even care that much. For example, the main character is crying like a big baby at the end because he realizes something, and I was just sitting there not caring. Also, I think the main final sequence in the film lacks the same kind of timely composure that Inception had in it's finale. Tenet was sloppier and not set up well enough for it's finale to feel satisfying. This had the general style of Inception but far less enjoyable or comprehensible."
1783,"I knew that the movie would be confusing, but wow... I couldn't follow most of it and have no idea what went on. To make things even more difficult to understand, the audio is all over the place and you can't hear what the actors are saying in a lot of the scenes.It wasn't all bad though. The visuals were phenomenal and I think that Robert Pattinson stole the show with his performance"
1784,"As explained early on when describing the film's MacGuffin, it's best to feel it rather than explain. This isn't good enough for the plot. While the movie serves up some great sequences, so do countless other far superior films, like Heat. A magical film whose action sequences service character and plot rather than servicing spectacle.Nolan seems best when plots are mostly provided in advance for him, like Batman Begins. Admittedly, time travel can't be the easiest thing to explain, but Nolan fails regardless.It's not terrible but just not good enough."
1785,"Really enjoyed Nolan's Inception, and was hoping for something similar. Boy, what a letdown! Unnecessarily difficult story. Way too slow and too long. Don't even bother watching it!"
1786,Best movie of the year by Christopher Nolan and very excited for next movie by Nolan.Nolan would now make a horror movie with best level no one can beat
1787,"This movie is totally puzzled and an average human can't understand in even second time
And sound mixing is also terrible"
1788,"Christopher Nolan has certainly done it again. Well done Chris, truly a visionary."
1789,They should offer complimentary ritalin at the movie theaters to help people follow along.
1790,"Tenet is the best film of the year, Nolan is an amazing director and continues to show the world new ways of film making, there has never been a film like this before, Tenet is amazing."
1791,"The concept of the film is extraordinary. Or, the concept of the science fiction part of the film.*While being thrown into a universe where time and space seizes to work as you're used to, there's a complete lack of character introduction. Lack of an understanding of what's at stake - more than ""the end of the world"". Which makes the film more for the eye than for the heart.There's an antagonist - with clear motives.
There's a protagonist - with clear motives.
But how either of them ended up facing the other one is something most of us needs to Google if we care to find out.The action is thrilling and the visual effects amazing, not to mention the inversion thingy.
But coming from Nolan's latest masterpiece, Interstellar, I was expecting more than just a concept and people executing that concept in front of the camera."
1792,Nolan does the Inception tactic again by using a convoluted story which nobody wants to admit they don't get it so everyone praises his work.The acting was really disappointing too.If you don't like Inception I really discourage you from seeing it.
1793,"Total nonsense from start to finish , can't hear dialogue over the horrendous sound track ( which is rubbish & sounds like it was made on an 80's broken Casio . Plot is abysmal & the reverse film shots are almost childlike . I cannot believe the budget for this film ?? Where the film makers all on drugs ? It's not even entertaining in the slightest . If I could give it 0 out of 10 I would ! Absolute Sxxxe . Give me a Daniel Craig James Bond movie any day ! Good luck if you're trying to understand or even hear what they're saying 👍😂😂"
1794,"I didn't understand this movie,But I'm giving 10 stars because I know this movie will be Great as Interstellar, I'm Going to watch this second time, may be I'll watch this three or four times until i understand,
Cinematography and the music was awesome ,"
1795,"It's a sad day when people pay to watch bad movies. I'm not sure Hollywood knows what good cinema is anymore, or the general audience for that matter.
Are bad movies an in thing now? Like all those horrible reality TV shows or beanie babies?"
1796,"Special effects were great. Visually well done. But, the script was flat, pretentious, hard to follow, and boring too much of the time. Not Interstellar pretentious but pretty darn close. Even the cast seemed to have a hard time staying engaged. Flat performances for the most part. Only the bad guy had an engaging performance.What was the best part of the movie? It was loud, on the big screen, and yes our first theater movie since the ""pandemic "".I suggest you wait for it to hit Netflix so you won't feel bad about sleeping through it."
1797,"Don't bother watching this movie if you didn't like Nolan's earlier films. Otherwise, you're in for the ride of a lifetime. Crazy that one person can keep out doing themselves so consistently."
1798,It s a mixt of actions not understood at all!! Bad bad bad
1799,"So, this movie is weird,but boring weird, no story, characters development is disaster ,
Worst movie i see in this year,."
1800,"It's rubbish. Totally and hugely disappointing. Performances are terrible, plot is silly and extremely misleading, and even the action scenes lack of the expected entertainment. Entire waste of money and time."
1801,"1 Star is too generous for this torture, waste of time, and waste of money. It is impossible to follow. I don't think you are supposed to. What is a story worth if it is basically meaningless. For me this is a case of the emperor's clothes. So much hype for nonsense and your typical car chases, boring fight scenes, bullets flying all over the place, etc.,etc. What a bore. I would have left the theater in peace if it weren't for my friends who I came with who tried to get something out of the movie. Typical Hollywood flashy garbage!"
1802,"Christopher Nolan worst movie so far. Highly overrated.
Besides the political agenda the movie is artificially confusing, not because content is so complicated, but simply because there is NOTHING to understand at all behind the confusing script.Terrible sound by the way, terrible acting. Christohper Nolan jumps on the woke train and does so not very successfullyNowadays Hollywood should really come up with more than just a woke script."
1803,"The film opens with music critics gone bad.May contain plot spoilers as I understand the plot. John David Washington is recruited to save the world from Andrei (Kenneth Branagh ) a Russian oligarch. A secret city in Russia was destroyed and has bomb grade 241 laying about in standardized containers. However, the plot isn't that simple. There is a time travel thing going on. Things move backwards and forwards in time. Both have to happen as not to disturb the entropy. If the algorithm is altered, everything ends. The guy who wants to start WWIII in involved with the time travel.Things were confusing to say the least with too much of the film running backwards to prevent a paradox. Needed to be shorter.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
1804,I'm so out of touch with you Hollywood wierdos. I dont even know who Cris Nolan is. But it's hard to believe this clown ever made a good movie. This movie was just horrible. I feel sorry for people who paid for this nonsense. Lmao
1805,Hands down the best movie Nolan has ever done! The sound is great and the gun fire sounds awesome. The soundtrack is so good to everything is good with this movie. And the ending is good but sad😰
1806,"Listen, I love Christopher Nolan films like the next person, but this was one of the most confusing films I have ever sat through. I gave a 6/10 because the cast and production were excellent, but leave 30 mins of this film on the cutting floor and help the viewer out with the WHY and HOWs. Very entertaining for the first 30-60 minutes, but there were so many unresolved and unaddressed motives. For the next film maker: please give a showing to a small group to address the complaints before sending to theaters. This film probably makes perfect sense to Christopher Nolan, but to the anticipated viewer, this was a total waste of time and money."
1807,"I just watched Tenet at the local Odeon omniplex, it was the last viewing on their biggest screen and as all cinemas nationwide will be closed from tomorrow due to a covid level 3 lockdown I was really looking forward to seeing Nolan's latest creation today. I was also the only person in the auditorium so I got the best seat.
For 10 minutes I struggled to understand any of the dialogue. The music was far too loud and bass heavy, speech was muddled. I complained to the staff who apologized and offered a refund saying the audio was poor but that was the way the film was released to them. I could switch to another screening but the audio would be the same.
Knowing the covid lockdown was due to kick in I decided to soldier on hoping for a small improvement (audio was ok during quieter scenes). This was a mistake. About an hour into the movie the 'direction' changes and I immediately started to feel physically unsettled. A few movies have this affect on me (Captain Phillips, Rush) a form of VIMS for those of you who susceptible to it.
I struggled on to the bitter end but my ability to focus on the plot was severely compromised.
I suspect I would really enjoy the movie if I was able to understand more than 60% of the dialogue and didn't have to fight a strong urge to vomit."
1808,"I don't remember seeing people rushing to leave the cinema this quickly since The Matrix sequels.After the first 5 minutes I lost track of what I was watching.
After 10, I stopped understanding why the story mattered.
After 15 minutes, I became genuinely disinterested.
... 135 minutes to go.What the hell happened?!?!IMO the main culprit was actually not the poor sound mixing, but the astonishingly bad LIGHTING. And SCRIPT.Tenet was the least well lit movie I have ever seen. With all its budget, it should have felt lush and vibrant, but instead felt cold as ice and just plain boring to watch.It's unfortunate how not good this movie is:
VISIONARY DIRECTOR - overstepping the boundary between understandable/relatable and incoherent/irrelevant.
COMPETENT ACTORS - not given much of a dialogue/story to work with
GREAT LOCATIONS - not utilised by poor editing, lighting and uninspired cinematography.Tenet wasn't painfully unpleasant to watch, but just barely. It's only outstandingly redeeming/memorable quality was that the villain was planning his own suicide. But even that was only hinted at and not explored. Like, at all.Yes."
1809,Great idea about inversion but ...first mistake is puting someone unknown in the lead and the whole point of watching the movie is to see what happens to them and WANTING to see what happens to them and in the first 20 minutes I lost interest and then it looked ok as picked up and then went back again so was feeling bored watching and again lost interest and it went like this through the whole movie. Copycat casting with Nolan as Michael Cane shows up again but nobody else strangely but still you just need keep looking for the quirky things that happen to keep you watching...me I still find no matter how much I push to keep watching I just cannot be bothered and want to skip to the end. The music in a movie needs to stand out as well and with no zimmer did not...a good soundtrack makes you want to listen/buy/download it but in whole the movie (picture and sound) did not stand out for me.
1810,"Very original the approach of the future, time flowing backwards (visually impressive), but very intricate sometimes, even for what is seen in Nolan's great filmography."
1811,Right now i just watched one time but I'm gonna watch it once or twice again ...it is really an epic movie from all sides from the cinematography to the sound effects (p.s it was hard to hear the actors in some scenes because of the sound effects were loud ) to the action scenes to the acting to the writing to the directing and also I'm a big fan of Nolan how he always can surprise us with his movies keep doing it ... it is really nice movie but also it is hard to understand the content and the story from the first so I suggest to rewatched again and again ...
1812,"There was this review about someone telling... the only protagonist in the movie was himself regretting in the future, paying 11 euros in the past. That's the way I felt.And all I can say (since everything -good and bad- has already been said here) is that my future came soon, because I walked out of the theater half way through.I love Sci-Fi, I love Christopher Nolan, a big fan of Hans Zimmer....I love time bending movies so I was full of anticipation and very high hopes. After about an hour I gave up trying to understand (I have about an 136 IQ), trying to like it, trying to cover my ears and decided to walk away. I will one day rewatch the whole thing from home renting it and having the possibility to rewind scenes to understand. I hope in the future I will find that this was an epic and brilliant masterpiece after all. If that happens I will in the future change my past review."
1813,"Warning! This review contains spoilers.Before I begin, the best summary of Tenet I can think of is this:Inception: Time is moving slower.
Interstellar: Times is moving faster.
Tenet: Yes!Here is why: while the first two movies tell a story in a linear way, the latter doesn't and not in a Tarantino non-linear way.Inception had a fresh idea and a fresh concept. Interstellar tried to be a modern version of 2001 where mankind is evolving into something else. Both of these two Nolan films have characters I can connect to and both films have spectacular visuals and excellent direction.This however has spectacular visuals and meticulous planing for the action scenes. Period. Neither has it a new idea nor characters I can connect with. The plot feels contrived, the Protagonist got recruited, I presume by Neil or events triggered by Neil (why else bring up the grandfather paradox?).
Then the so called protagonist had to go to Priya, to the wife, to the bad guy, to the wife to Priya to stop a thing to save all from total annihilation just to learn he recruited Neil. The loop is complete. The last movie with such a contrived scavenger hunt I saw was Rise of Skywalker.The idea of a temporal cold war isn't new either. Star Trek Enterprise came up earlier. The idea of total annihilation is even older.If you pay attention and assume Nolan follows the logic he sets up, you can figure out the ""good"" ending pretty early on. Or else the movie would simply stop after two minutes, because well...annihilation. Once I figured that out I got so bored I tried to figure out how he did the effects without computers.One might go deeper into the plot and what it all means, but you won't find any new or satisfying answers. Also since it is not really an ambiguous ending like in Inception or an emotional satisfying ending like Interstellar you'll waste time by trying to analyse it. The analysis is simply given by Neil when he says that whatever happens, happend. Never felt so trolled.But I assume the movie can be entertaining and it definitely is better than the trash we got before the beer bug."
1814,"I watched this movie a second time and more understood it, my advice to those who recklessly put bad reviews, this is a complicated film, watch it a few times and you will understand that this is another masterpiece from Nolan"
1815,"If you know anything about Christopher Nolan's movies, then you'll know that 1) you'll have to watch this movie more than once to understand it & 2) you need to do research if you aren't exceedingly knowledgeable at the sciences. - I'm not so I did a lot of research to understand what was going on.
This movie is all about time travel & unlike most time travel movies, Tenet's time travel concept is that everything is predestined so everything you do, have done, and will do have been accounted for. So whatever you do in the past will not change your future. Once you understand that concept the movie will make more sense to you.
There are two ways you can get back in time: regular vs inverted. So for regular you can go back in time however, you can't go back to the time you left. You're going to have to wait the amount of time you traveled back to. (Ie if you go back 2 days, then you'll have to wait 2 days to move forward with your life). And when you go back inverted, everything is backwards & with this version you can go back to the moment you left.
This movie is one of his bests and really gets your gears going. I would recommend watching it twice. Tenet is a genius film."
1816,"As a huge Nolan fan, I can easily say this is one of his most entertaining films to date. I just finished seeing the film for a third time, and it gets increasingly better with each viewing. I think the cast all give great performances, I really like the wit and charisma of John David Washington as ""The Protagonist"", and the charm of Robert Pattinson. But the big role for me here, was with Elizabeth Debeki as Kat. She's gives the best performance of the film in my opinion, containing the most emotion. Story wise, this comes across as a simple save the world type film, but it hefts far more interesting with the inclusion of inversion. This is by far Nolan's most conceptually confusing film to date. As to be expected however, multiple rewatches helped improve this. Visually the movie looks great. Various locations and shots containing inversed aspects was a joy to watch. Especially when integrated into the action. This is by far Nolan's best film for fight sequences. Choreography has improved a ton here. Overall, a great film for spectacle, action and enjoyment. It does lack a lot of the heart present in Inception and especially in Interstellar. But as an experience, rated on enjoyment and pure quality. This is a near masterpiece in my opinion."
1817,"Tenet doesn't have a single slow scene. It's visual effects are so unique and have never been done before. The movie is highly complex but with a second watch it makes it even more enjoyable. Great performances all around, great actions scenes and a very unique movie. Only issue I had was sound mixing which I think gets fixed in the blue ray version of the film."
1818,"As everyone knows nolan is best in making mind bending and mind challenging movies,and this time nolan came with tenet as expected this movie crossed my expectations,truth to be told I understood inception by just watching it once,but tenet made me to watch it twice,i felt tenet is 10 times of inception, in inception you just need to watch it concentratedly,but while watching tenet you need to solve the scenes to understand it which makes everyone watch atleast twice.
Coming to cast Robert Pattinson and John David washington given their best and Ludwig Göransson replaced space of hans Zimmer very well,
Finally it does not make sense that not understanding a movie means not liking it,both can't be related,any way thank you Nolan expecting more than this in your next film."
1819,"Incredibly compelling, complex, and with a stellar cast and fantastic direction- Tenet may be a bit overwhelming for some viewers, but once you get the full view of the film Nolan has made, there is no doubt that you are truly watching a masterpiece. The film is lead with some fantastic performances. There is no doubt that John David Washington is great in his role, but the true standouts in the film are Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki, and most notably Kenneth Branagh in the role of Sator. The cinematography in this film is quite groundbreaking, and i'm sure will be nominated accordingly due to its sheer brilliance. As Nolan has done before with Dunkirk, the film is shot in IMAX, and there is no doubt that the brilliance behind the camera and seen on screen is absolutely outstanding. This is a very hard film to talk about, as I feel the film itself should be seen going in blind to provide for a better viewing. The plot in this film, although I won't necessarily get into specifics, can be quite hard to follow, and though the film does come full circle by the end, there is no doubt that you will be intrigued and wanting to watch it again for a better understanding. I love the look of this film, by providing a reality that is unsettling but also classy, and by providing a world that isn't only intriguing but incredibly well thought out. Every scene is so well done, that even if you don't enjoy the film, you can't help but admire it for its technical and thorough brilliance. It's score is excellent and unnerving, and its atmosphere is James Bond like, but done in an incredibly unique fashion. In the end, Tenet may be a challenging viewing for some. But if willing to give into the fact that, as the characters feel, you may not comprehend everything at first, Tenet will certainly be a breathtaking viewing experience for all.
My Rating: 10/10"
1820,"There were four of us who watched this and we all agree on this film.I think I've watched all of Chris Nolan's films (except Following - was that his? I'm not googling it).Like almost everyone I've enjoyed them all.I'll get to the point.Chris Nolan should take a long time out and fix scripts, he writes, before presenting them to us.The central idea in this film is novel. It actually, once you understand it, is straightforward to understand, unique and clever.When you write a script based on this central idea (I am trying not to say much about this film in case I spoil it), you should really attempt to educate the audience better.It took almost half the film (and may be that is the point artistically - the halfway point) before I sort of understood some of what was going on. Then when you understand it, you have no time to digest or be explained things as the plot eventually gets everything and kitchen sink thrown at it.May be concept requires a second viewing to appreciate it. May be the concept was not explained well enough when you did watch it the first time.You see characters, in films, should be asking questions that the audience want answering and explaining. There is a storytelling technique to handholding an audience through a plot. It's not easy but that's why we have screenwriters there to do their magic to get the information to us.And here is the problem. Christopher Nolan is not a screenwriter who deals with audiences taking a breather. He is one who works out the machinations of what's going to happen and presents it logically. It's like a formula being presented where you have to go over it many times before you get it and it gets more complicated to understand if the writer, who presents that formula, isn't very good at understanding the audience. Audiences aren't in on it and nor are they super whizzes. They need things explained in a manner that allows the story to flow and in a way that doesn't lose them.Now you could say, Chris Nolan's is a great writer...he did Batman, Prestige etc but you're missing the vital ingredient here and that is his brother Jonathan.He's really the showman. He's the one that takes a complicated idea and writes a screenplay that gives the audience ample time to get with what's being shown. You may have questions sure but not questions like ""what the hell was going on?"".In the case of Dunkirk, there wasn't a complicated idea, and it was a film for a director to sink his teeth into. Music was great. Visuals were great. Plot was easy to follow and didn't distract. It wasn't ""inception"" in it's mind bendiness and even then you followed most of what was going on in ""inception"".Tenet not only has the problem of a over (or is it very?) complicated plot, but it also fails in the use of sound and visuals.The print is so contrasty that there are scenes, in the film, that you can't make out who is who. A dark face in a dark room for example. The sound is so loud at points, that you simply can't hear what is being said so you lose the thread of what's going on. The editing, in parts, is so quick (especially the last third), you miss what's just happened.This all adds to the problem of following the plot.You simply can't.And I feel that when you have to google a video to explain the film to you, there is something wrong in the way the film presented itself.I mean we all do that with twisty turny plots, google after, BUT when the person explaining it had to watch the film multiple times to understand it themselves then I think the plot is too complex.Don't get me wrong, this is not a boring film. It keeps you engaged but most of the time you are left scratching your head hoping that someone will explain what just happened.It's got a spy thriller vibe and you can see the Batman influences.Ultimately, this film is an interesting classic in the making not because the film is a classic but because you will need to buy the blu ray to watch it again and again to understand all the different things that happened and why....and even then you'll still need someone to explain things.Chris Nolan has really worked hard on putting the pieces of a puzzle together (there is a certain circularity to it) but what he has failed to do is present that puzzle that makes people want to buy it.It's not so much a Rubik's cube or Jenga but more Klingon Chess....the rules are not obvious.Pity. I personally would wait for the Blu Ray so you can rewatch it."
1821,"This movie feels way to complicated for nothing.
The plot felt very similar to a Bond movie.
An agent is sent to save the world from a bad guy who wants to wipe the world with a overly complex weapon. Let's not forget the beautiful wife who needs saving and ends up falling for the main character. Add in some useless time travelling scenes and some well tailored suits and voilà!Sorry, really not a fan of the script and the sound.
I gave this movie a 5/10 because of the beautiful cinematography and choreography.Wouldn't recommend seeing in theatres."
1822,"Nolan is my favourite director and I love him more than any Actor, Franchise or Studio.I wanted to understand this film on deeper level, how Nolan processed it, breaking it down by everybit. But on first watch it was too much to handle, contrary with movies like Inception and Memento: you understand the exposition and continue on with same elements. While over here stuffs still went on, unfolding still happened. I took the 'don't understand, feel it' route for 3rd act. Didn't even know what was going on. Silly me thought they triggered the grandfather paradox.Then I read the wiki plot and a much more in depth plot from a different site, understood it and gave another rewatch within 24hours.As I slowly unrevealled majority of things, I loved it. I understand earlier plot points being established. I adore Memento very much because I like to connect the dots, this was same with much complexity. I spent hours walking and thinking about this film from multiple character's perspective, those small details are what makes this film so much better for me.I am science guy so I love real science being used by filmmakers to help there storytelling, even if impossible science - they stem from real science: entropy, reverse radiation. For Fission, fusion exist... Newtons 3rd law is action:reaction... so entropy might decrease even thou that destroys 2nd law of thermodynamics. I loved the Oxygen-CO2 reverse... friction of tire. I upload daily content about science in movies on Twitter- @science_moviesMasterpiece of action sequence choreography. The amount of work that goes into creating that, sweet. The reverse cinematography was also gold.JDW had class, Robert Pattinson was charming- a bit more character to him would have been great but Nolan lets audience finish the puzzle. Kat was stunning and I thing I needed more her and her son screentime to fully care. KB as villain was great, good but not great motives.At first I thought it was more of point A to point B to C to D with forced action sequence like a bad action film but Nolan is the smartest film maker.Spoilers-
Love the multiple twist this movie had. Didn't expect to see Protagonist vs Protagonist. The Neil twist was heartbreaking and brings full circle to many things. The final twist of Protagonist being the mastermind and he will be doing things 'over and over again' was okay but I have seen similar things on multiple movies: Terminator, 12 Monkeys etc.Watch this film with subtitles, rewatches are mandatory."
1823,I didnt understand anything. like inception. but better i guess. scenes are A M A Z I N G! amazing! just amazing! nolan best director of 21st century for me. also i really loved pattinson in this movie. first tenet and the batman(2021). he is really good actor.10/10
1824,"Movie is made like Nolan has mastered the theory of time inversion, tricky yet epic."
1825,"No spoilers ... the film is a rollercoaster of a ride. I watched it, as intended by Christopher Nolan, in London in 1570 IMAX. An initial and very short lived impression is ""Emperor's new clothes"" then as you walk out of the screening it gets to you as you recall scenes early in the film that are referenced later in the film, you start to assemble the links in your head, recall some of the set pieces, the vehicle scenes, the science and within minutes it has you in its grip and you (a) want to book to see it again, and (b) dig out some of the other Nolan films at home to get another fix."
1826,"It's really sad to see people that don't understand this movie or almost any Christopher Nolan movies give it a bad rating. Tenet is a loud, beautiful, confusing movie. You most likely wont understand it the first time, but when you do Its a great movie. The thought and the effort that has gone to this movie is outstanding. The use of SGI was very little and there was no green screens. The great acting of the characters make the movie so much better. The sound track is kinda loud but again that kinda fits with the overall vibe of the film. 10/10"
1827,"Christopher, once again, created another masterpiece full of action and a mindbending story. Both the direction and sound create a feeling of putting the viewers on the edge of the seat throughout the movie. The connections between the realitys are beautifully made in the action sequences and the storyline.Masterclass director, there for masterclass cast!"
1828,"This is by far the best film i have ever seen , and this coming from someone who is a big Nolan fan . if you loved Inception , this will make your brain work again to try to unlock the movie . of course some people were not happy with it , as it is known that Nolan Movies are not for everybody . and thus making them hard to appreciate and underrated for the average viewers . go and see this masterpiece and you will not regret it . might need to watch 2 or 3 times to understand it completely ."
1829,Awesome movie that just like Inception needs your interest to follow and rewards you for doing so. Great movie.
1830,I rated it 7/10 because it's a fun story. In some parts it's deliberately obscure but that's OK. I just think the story line has issues. I'm not going into detail as that would be spoilers.
1831,Absolute Masterpiece . Greatest movie from One of Greatest director Christopher Nolan
1832,"Best film of the year so far (Okay not much has come out but still). If he wasn't already before this film I think this definitely puts Nolan in the bracket as one of the best directors of all time.Tenet is brilliant in every way, it gets straight into the action, extremely fast paced and at 2 hrs and 30 mins it doesn't feel like it drags, this is probably his best film since Inception, the performances were great and the action is goodOverall I'm going to give Tenet a 10/10"
1833,This is by far his worst movie. This was just loud senseless and 3 hours long
1834,"Tenet is a movie that makes good actors look bad beacuse you can't get interested in their story. None of the charachter ever develop properly, the editing is terrible, full of random uncoherent scenes.
The movie is a worse version of James Bond serial. Story is not really that interesting, you just wait for something to happen, bit it feels every scene ends too soon even tho it's 150 min long.
The dialog is terrible, littered with stupid humor that I expect to see in a Marvel movie.
Nolan once again proved that he does not know how to develop charachters.
Overall, not worth the time it takes to watch it."
1835,"It was great to be back in a packed cinema where i paid extra for the IMAX experience of this film. What a letdown! Right from the start the sound was terrible, making it very difficult to understand the dialogue which didn't help in trying to understand a very convoluted story. The basic premise is interesting enough but I believe there is far too much focus on the big action sequences for it's own good. Yes some of the scenery and cinematography are fantastic but they seem to be there just for the sake of it and actually detract from the story line. There are clumsy attempts at both the beginning and the end to explain how the plot works but the middle 90% is just loud noise and confusion. I can't even see myself watching it again in order to work out what is going on in each of the scenes. Over-hyped and very dissatisfying.."
1836,"I have the feeling the entire purpose of the film was to create something so ""intellectually"" complex it would be talked about in the same vein as The Matrix or Inception were in their day. To me, it failed miserably.
Firsty, and I checked with others leaving the cinema and all agreed, the sound balance is all wrong. Unless the actors were sitting in an empty room having a chat, a lot of their dialogue was muffled, quiet and generally impossible to hear. It felt at times like watching a foreign language movie with no subtitles. This made trying to understand the overly forced plot even harder, and eliminated even the smallest amount of character development to the point where I personally didn't care who lived or died.
The special effects were well done, but again, there were just way too many of them as the plot lost the plot at the 2 hour mark. It was probably meant to be a build up to a grand crescendo, but ended up feeling as if a piano was dropped from a height in the hope that a few notes might make a tune, but when it didn't call, they just pretended it was modern jazz.......
I have heard other say you need to see it a ""couple"" of times to appreciate it.
Not a chance."
1837,"Brilliant but flawed, fantastic visually , the best soundtrack to a movie in a long time."
1838,"I didn't understand a single thing, but I really enjoyed it!
And the music is reaaally cool"
1839,"I think Nolan wanted something to overwrite the Dunkirk failure and ended up using his best idea before someone else dropped something along it's a genre.To me, it felt like I was watching avengers whereby Thanos wants to snap but iron man actually controls the gauntlet.Then we watch the whole story like the vantage point movie but this time from 2 perspectives
One on rewind the other- real-time.Overall this would have blown half my mind
But since it's Nolan's work, I was disappointed once more.Please do not piece this with interstellar or inception.Maybe piece it with memento add a few jokes cook in some 007And I was left wondering why didn't Nolan take the CONTACT '97' route or infuse a bit of primer into the algorithmQuestion Tenet using pie or Infinitum algorithm
Add that God sense like in interstellar."
1840,Way too complicated to enjoy. It could have been a really good movie if they didn't make it so complicated and hard to understand what was going on. I left the cinema confused and disappointed. I will definitely not be watching it again.
1841,"He's an absolute genius, that's all i have to say.Great movie"
1842,"Aside from what had already been said here, this movie just confirms that time travel concept as Hollywood views it is stupid.The real time travel is an idea of you getting into a rocket and travelling through space at high speed and then returning back to Earth, so you only age very little, while all those left on Earth are now old or dead. Time just flows differently for you.The way Hollywood sees it is going back into the past and interacting with it. Changing what already isn't. So how is this going to happen? You create a machine that will - for your own whim - create a biological copy of yourself that can interact with your past self and change the substance of things to way they were before? And does this only apply to our planet or will the death of one Russian oligarch delete everything and sets every other intelligent race in the universe back to Big Bang?Do you see how insane this is?"
1843,I'm going to travel back in time to kill myself so I don't have to watch this movie. The sound of loud crashes and random sounds mean you can't hear the dialogue. Nonsense. My ears are bleeding.
1844,"Especially if you're a fan of the 'time travel' and 'parallel universes' movies and series, that's a movie with a new optic about these themes, the effects and the music are amazing, the actors awesome... Literally a masterpiece! You have to check this out by yourself, it's worth it! I will go probably and watch it for 2nd time!"
1845,"This film is not for general audiences and TENET is very much complicated, so I had to see this film a couple of times. This film is a bit underrated by critics and other reviewers and I am pretty sure that the people who rated it below 8 are not familiar with the physics involved in this film and most probably trying to find the definition of 'entropy'.So, I will be pointing out the pros and cons of this filmPros: All the actors have done a fantastic job. This kind of film needs intensive amount of planning and precision which is done fabulously. The background score is good. It is the screenplay that makes the film more interesting. The ideas used in this film are much more complicated than his other films. One of the scene which happens in Tallinn, Estonia is a major plot of the film which needs intense planning and editing which is done superbly by the team.Cons: The sound mixing in this film is not done well, watching with subtitles will be preferable, I sometimes feel that the background score over dominates the dialogues in some major scenes which makes it difficult for us to focus on the dialogues. You have to watch the film twice (or may be thrice) to fully understand and grasp the concept behind the film.Except for these things, the film looks alright to me, if you think the film is confusing as hell then try watching it again.
Thus, this film is worth watching."
1846,Nonsensical. bad acting. illogical boriing movie. The editor to happy jumping here and there. this movie too self-indulgent and not believable and boring.
1847,"I have been carefully following Mr. Nolan's films from the time ""FOLLOWING"" 1998 came out. His films were amazing, deep, cryptic, cinematic, entertaining and interesting. His other work, including MEMENTO 2000, INSOMNIA 2002, THE PRESTIGE 2006, INCEPTION 2010 and INTERSTELLAR 2014 were all fantastic.Through years I noticed how he was Hollywoodized and his films turned into movies and got filled with bullets and guns when 'wit' started to disappear slowly. Obviously he only makes 'movies' now, for the Americans who can not understand anything without guns and shooting. Then he made DUNKIRK and I was wondering why someone like him would choose a Second World War story. Now I know why: He got bankrupt intellectually and as a result he lost his amazing cinematic talent.Now, with this totally meaningless mishmash of 'nothing' borrowed bits and pieces of story he comes out 'blazing' to make lots and lots of money. My main question is how did you spend $200 on 'this'? Playback in rewind mode costs that much? How did you manage to convince the studio to risk their money and face with something so STUPID like this? How did you fool them? It is not your fault, you have become one of millions who are looking for an easy way to rip-off others. I am amazed by the stupidity of the accountants at Paramount who gave you the money. They are the dumb ones. I am sure this is your last big project. Learn from the masters. They never betrayed their audiences.Where is your integrity, Mr. Nolan? When Brad Grey hired you, did you walk in his office with ideas such as 'this' one?I thought you were great, but obviously you had an expiration date and it is passed that date now.Please retire before everybody else finds out how empty you have become."
1848,"Its a rather simple complex plot once you stop and think. But people arent able to, so they rather hate. This movie is like james bond on crack in reverse. great different film to wrap your head around. I would love for a real end of the world nolan film though"
1849,This film has chosen the worst time to come out and has been delayed twice but it is so worth the wait. The film is truely a masterpiece by using complex concepts that you will only appreciate by watching it twice. The action sequences are some of the best in cinema along with the entire film using practical effects and minimal cgi. This is a must see sci fi thriller.
1850,"OMG. This POC (piece of cinema) was so confusing from start to finish. I understand the premise, but execution was lacking severely.
IMHO, this movie does not support the story due to non existent character development. Each scene was struggling to connect to the last, as the action was blurred to distract the viewer. I was constantly trying to figure out what was going on and who I was suppose to focus on with the storyline. I was having issues with what was a flashback and what was in ""real"" time, since it was setup like it should have been. I am sorry to say, But Mr. Nolan has not made a good film that I have seen. Maybe a acquired taste, but if you want action, fine. If you want drama, fine. But quit being a jack of all trades and concentrate on one subject and do it well.
Sadly I was really looking forward to this film since it was announced. However, after going to the theater, I was let down almost the whole time. I might give it another chance later if someone else had not seen it. But I would not buy, download or own this movie."
1851,"THE FIRST PARAGRAPH IS SPOILER FREEWhen people say that this is movie construed of ""Nolan's greatest hits"" they are not wrong. This film combines not only a complex idea with inversion (which is not nearly as complicated as I was thinking it would be. Just make sure ""you don't try to understand it... feel it"") But a complex story telling structure. Where Nolan reveals only what he wants you to know on his time. From a film making standpoint this has it all, acting across the board, cinematography, paralyzing score, incredible realistic action. It is a movie that will require multiple viewings, but don't let its complexity scare you away from the film. For those who do not seek a complex movie, you can still be thoroughly entertained with John David Washington and Robert Pattinson's charm as well as the incredible visual masterpiece that unfolds before your eyes.SPOILER SECTIONThose who have seen the movie. YOU MUST see it at least twice. At first watch the film seemed to lack the emotional gut-punch that Inception had. But the relationship between the protagonist and Neil, although a bit weak upon first viewing, EXPLODES during multiple viewings. ""You don't drink on the job"" ""I'll see you in the beginning, friend."" The minor pieces of dialogue carry the most amount of weight in the film. And Nolan does this because we see the film from the point of view of the protagonist, who at the time, really doesn't know anything. Every time I saw it (I saw it four times :)) I picked up on something new. Which is why this is one of my favorite Nolan films. He has returned to his roots in this film, and has taken what he has learned in the past and applied it in the best way possible to this film."
1852,"Someone had to cut down on film shooting hours, so they vomited this movie at audience faces.This is true ugly vomit."
1853,"The second the movie started i couldn't close my mouth for solid 10 minutes, thank God I was wearing a mask, lol.
I missed few hints and wouldn't have noticed them if not pointed out by my friend watching with me. Definitely recommend a second viewing of the movie.
I wished of the movie had more details on the idea of time moving backwards because it's very uneasy to get the hand of it on first.
I lOVED Pattinson, he did great job."
1854,I loved this film I recommended this film is cool :inversion and future.but is confuse
1855,I thought this was incredible to watch from a visual point of view in the cinema. But I found the storyline very confusing and will probably need another watch to catch all the little details. My biggest issue was with the sound. The sound of the action almost burst my eardrums and then the dialogue was muffled and completely unintelligible. The scene on the catamaran was such a waste because I couldn't hear a word of what anyone was saying. Might have to wait for it to come out on streaming and turn the subtitles on.
1856,"There are elements of Christopher Nolan's Tenet that has been inspired by other sources. 12 Monkeys, La Jetée, The Red Dwarf episode called Backwards, Steven Moffat's Doctor Who stories featuring River Song.Stripped of its gimmick of inverted time. It is basically John Le Carre's The Night Manager. Elizabeth Debicki appeared in the television adaptation and basically plays a similar character in Tenet.The Protagonist (John David Washington) teams up with sidekick Neil (Robert Pattinson) to stop Russian oligarch Sator (Kenneth Branagh) who has found a way to send a destructive weapon back from the future.In this temporal war, the Protagonist needs to get to Sator via his estranged wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki.)The inverted backward effects are eye dazzlingly conveyed. Nolan once again goes for an expensive high concept James Bond type set pieces.However the various going ons in the story is confusing. Not helped by terms such as Time Inversion, Temporal Pincer movement. I found the trick is to follow the forward narrative of Neil and not be confused by the The Protagonist's stories.Tenet is an enjoyable funfair ride. However I also felt that it was something you would quickly forget as you do not want to spend a lot of time thinking about it. I have no doubts that I would watch it again at a later date.Due to Covid 19, the cinema I saw it at was almost empty and I watched it on a weekend. That did somewhat rob the atmosphere."
1857,"As a filmmaker, I can appreciate Nolan's ""mastering-sound-for-IMAX-not-the-average-theatre"" mindset, but given the fact that you can't even hear the dialogue in the regular theatres takes this waaaay too far. I'm 17, and my hearing is excellent, yet, seeing this movie made me feel like a 70-year-old rockstar who played one too many concerts. I couldn't tell you what ANYONE said in certain scenes, and given that, about 2/3 of the movie is still a mystery to me after watching it. If this movie was mixed separately for both regular and IMAX theatres, I might like it more, but liking it starts with understanding it, and that just didn't happen. It wasn't even that the movie was ""too smart,"" it was purely at fault of the levels in audio. I would've seen it in IMAX, as I do with nearly every film, but given that theatres are quite closed right now, a regular theatre was all I had access to."
1858,"Though story seems science fiction about time inversion ( travel?) it is not perfectly that one can understand well. In such time travel theory there is always confusion of Paradox and it remains here too. First sequence of explaining time inversion about of a bullet, but I totally failed to gain its theory. Movie also feeling a longer without strong story material. Time line at ending is very confused. Almost dead woman goes back in time to correct her time line that will make a different future of her. This is not properly shown and without mention of paradox. As me story plot is interesting but director and story writer failed to believe us in their theory. A viewer like me hardly will believe in such messy theory. Dimple Kapadia and Elizabeth Debicki have noticeable roles. Especially Elizabeth who has towering height and good looks with well acting. You might have seen her in 'Widows'. Male actors are just okay except Robert Pattinson, he looks very handsome with some acting spark and fetch your attention while he is on the screen. Overall a failed story plot of good science fiction base."
1859,"How could you possibly enjoy a movie that makes you feel steps behind the entire time, you may ask? Somehow, Nolan does it! Tenet leaves you with questions at every line and action. Never have I been so floored by the desire to understand. Watching the movie is a fun game of feeling like you are completely in the loop and realizing you are completely unaware of what is happening. Somehow, you are able to grasp just enough of the plot to hang on with a vice-like grip. It felt like a wickedly tricky puzzle squealing to be solved. Personally, I love the challenge of trying to keep pace (and if possible, ahead of the story). It was delightful experience for a brain that has been living in the slumber of post-quarantine. Many may not feel up to the task of staying completely attentive the entire movie. Be warned, you truly cannot blink or else you will miss everything!"
1860,"At first watch it was a initial disappointment, with such high hopes from Nolan back in the directors chair. This script is overcomplicated to the extreme, like many of Nolan's films - but it's foundational theme or premise (e.g. in Inception, the concept of a dream within a dream, is easy to remember) is too vague and hard to follow. The characters are as I see it quite 2-dimensional overall, but all deliver great performances nevertheless.It misses the top mark because it cannot compare with the mastery of filmmaking that Inception and Interstellar bring to the screen, but it's visuals and it's acting make it very entertaining despite that - I gave it a 6/10.As I went in for the second viewing after understanding the plot, the film was bumped up to a sold 8/10, once you understand what's going on and the chronology, it's a brilliant interpretation of what could be perceived as time travel. I cannot deny that this film is extremely overcomplicated for the casual audience and that can deter people, but if you thoroughly enjoy Nolan's craft, give this one another go after watching and explanation video... (even though I shouldn't really have to watch one in the first place) and you may enjoy it more the second time around."
1861,"The sound isn't too loud it's epic. This movie is an epic in its self. The only thing that sucked about the movie was the boring moments, and the confusing almost nonsensical plot. But you have to admit the soundtrack was phenomenal. The part where the plain crashes and you get that loud brass with the low angle was amazing. Also the twists were great, and people were only confused by why things were happening. Watch the movie again but instead don't try to understand why s h i t is backwards. Just enjoy the movie...DamStop trashing on the movie it's not horrible. You're all a bunch of pretentious critics who can't let themselves enjoy a movie.Sorry not sorry,
Joe MammaP.S
Mad cuz bad"
1862,"The retrocausality of our reality being the cumulative interactions of fundamental particles travelling forward and backwards in time is an actual scientific theory/speculation. To translate this into macro objects and people is bonkers. However, Nolan has brilliantly imagined and realised this into something of a consistent storyline. Deep respect and I really enjoyed it. Who doesn't love a pincer movement in time?The cinematography, acting and action scenes were spot-on.Understandably, there are some plot issues. How can there not be when positing a deeply paradoxical reality? I list the following simply because I like coherence and these strike off-notes and not simply to be accepted as paradoxes. Also, I have only seen it once and possibly have missed something and so am ready to be corrected.1. Whilst the overall premise is somewhat shielded by repeated reference to the Grandfather Paradox the evil intent goes beyond this i.e. apparently expecting the future environment to be changed for the better but their own existence to be unaffected. Seems incompatible thinking to me unless perhaps they selflessly intended some sort of blind reset hoping for a better future for the universe?2. The explanations also mixed QM interpretations with reference to many-worlds to sidestep a question from our protagonist.3. Our protagonist sees the start of a fire and experiences a fire but we are meant to understand that he was going in the opposite direction in time so it was actually cooling?4. It is mentioned that under no circumstance can a time-traveller physically touch their other-selves but this seems to posit some special status to our constituent particles rather than others which is unwarranted.I like the method of communicating to the future by simply writing something down! Communicating back in time by sending something inverted. Presumably people going back 20 years would have to travel back for 20 years? One gets inverted by these turnstiles and presumably can only stop going back in time with a turnstile? Unclear what happened to people travelling backwards before the 1st turnstile was created - presumably kept going back? Also seems as though there will end up being multiple simultaneous copies of a time-traveller going in the same direction? For instance, the blue team must have switched back to going forward and their original selves must also be going forward in the same timeframe? Or a timeloop?I am also not sure about this hiding of the algorithm in time. Presumably just 'before' the algorithm-creator decided to destroy/hide them in time that was a vulnerable spot for a future time-traveller to intercept them without the need for this dead-drop?I probably need to watch again and may update this review. However, as stated, it can never actually make sense of course and is mainly just great fun."
1863,"One of the best movies that I've seen in the last 4 years. If you enjoy Christopher Nolan's movies, you will definitely love this one"
1864,"Please don't rate low, if you don't understand the concept."
1865,"Christopher Nolan is brilliant, obviously. We've seen that demonstrated in several formats. This ""format"" is new to film. Let me say this for everyone who dislikes this film because of its structure - no one will watch the credits roll and understand the entirety of what they just witnessed. Just like the characters in the film, you have to travel back to that seat in the theater and watch the experience as your future self, the one that has gathered knowledge of the film's basic structure and the mechanics of inversion and it's affect on the unchangeable timeline Nolan displays. You can't understand this non-linear thinking in just one viewing of the film, that's the point. This isn't a movie in the traditional sense at all, this is a present from Nolan to the world. It can be unwrapped, unboxed, discected, etc etc. The ""storyline"" is only made visible to those who have gathered an understanding of how inversion works and then piece the extraneous confusing bits together into a four dimensional timeline that's just a story about a dude saving the world from a bad guy with a big bomb."
1866,"Although it didn't get over Inception for me, but I think this is his second masterpiece directly right after his 2010 mind-blowing dreamy Sci-Fi heist thriller ! The cinematography is astonishing. The time inversion choreography is breathtaking. The cast had done an enormous job here. Ludwig nailed the music, which suits well the emotionally heartfelt story of The Protagonist and Neil. Nolan improves every movie."
1867,"I just watched Tenet in IMAX laser. Intriguing! One man and the whole civilization is an important philosophical question. The entire caste was magnificent. The music was amazing. Enjoyed every minute. And Yes, I want to review, and perhaps more than once, to savor all the details of this intrigue."
1868,"Tenet is Christopher Nolan's highly anticipated, incredibly complicated, unique take on the spy genre. The film is relentlessly fast paced and has a high chance of leaving you behind in the story, if you miss out on one line of dialogue, the next hour of the film will not make sense. A complex, twisting script is part of Nolan's reputation and at times succeeds, for example, Inception, Tenet goes too fast and doesn't take a break to explain it's concepts.
Tenet does succeed on multiple levels though, it has brilliant practical stunts, fantastic environments and wonderful cinematography, it also has multiple great performances from all of the cast.
Overall, Tenet is a phenomenal movie which is worth watching in theatres."
1869,"What happened and what happened next nobody understand frist time when watch the movie. Time flow to future or future to past this question hacked viewer barin. But time reverse idea and it's story telling style as different all of any kind movie. New concept, new presentation just used barin to watch this movie......
Watch this movie carefully two or three time or never fully understand this movie."
1870,"This movie is typical from Christopher Nolan, is very fast and complex. It isn't his best film but it isn't the worst. If you are going to watch it for the first time try to enjoy the film because you don't have to understand it at first.
I understand that some people didn't like it, because it is hard to follow, watch it twice and you won't be disappointed.
This movie has a vincule with the music and the sound, when you are at the cinema it feels like you where in the movie because of that extraordinary sound that it has, maybe some times the sound can result annoying.
In my opinion this is a must watch movie if you like Christopher Nolan, spy's films like James Bond and time travel."
1871,Amazing cinematography and the perfect score instead of pointless dialogue. A lot happens without words. Also the skip forward scenes are awesome too. Amazing
1872,One of the best movie I have been seen this year.great job by director christofer nolan
1873,"This is the greatest time-travel film I've seen for years. It doesn't have to contain too many alternate timeline like ""Primer"", or the ""Butterfly Effect"", but it's still mind-blowing in its own right. It has a somewhat similar feel like ""The Terminator"" and ""Predestination"", in the sense that there's a special force/ organization in the future who tries to prevent an apocalypse from happening and a character's backstory has an insane revelation. The acting here is top-notch, Robert Pattinson nailed it as Neil, he's going to be another perfect Batman just like Ben Affleck and Christian Bale, who coincidentally also portrayed John Connor with a rag-tag camouflage costume. John David Washington as The Protagonist was really dashing and fun to watch, and Elizabeth Debicki was the soul of the film. Just like many of Nolan's other masterpieces, this motion picture also features a lot fantastical and thought-provoking concepts, from dream within dreams (false awakening), Wormholes and Black holes in General Relativity, amnesia to justice, fairness, anarchism, randomness and the meaning of life, TENET is no exception, it has spectacular scenes where people and the environments are moving forwards and backwards simultaneously, or where agents could reverse the flow of entropy, or ponder over the destructive impulses of human nature, and kind of mimics the lesson in ""Interstellar"" and ""Star Trek"", whether it's better to trust your reason and rationality or your instinct, your heart versus your brain. The script is brilliant, with cerebral themes and elegant ideas, like free will, determinism, faith in the future, consequentialism, the human condition, and so on. It's a lot different from ""Terminator"" and ""Back to the future"" as those subscribe to the hypothesis of multiple timelines while TENET, just like ""Harry Potter"" and ""Predestination"", does not, so there are insane implications, like the past might not be changed, and from that we have to face responsibility of our actions. It also deals with contemporary concerns like climate change, nuclear weapons, social inequality, and more. The visual effects are eye-opening and insane, unlike anything ever seen in cinema. The cinematography is enthralling, even the cuts are seamless. To the critics who said this film is cold, sterile and emotionless, have you seen ""2001: A Space Odyssey""?
I don't even know what the actual hell was the version that you saw, but from my timeline, TENET is NOT, by any means emotionally distant. It might be inaccessible and sophisticated to some viewers, but not emotionless at all. So you mean to freaking tell me, that Neil and the Protagonist's eventual end of their friendship wasn't touching? Or that Neil willingly sacrificing himself for the greater good of mankind and dying the same battle over and over again wasn't heart-breaking? Or their farewell to each other wasn't heart-warming and powerful? My theatre literally stood up and cheered seeing what a hero Neil was. Did you even see Elizabeth's character endure through the pain of her tortures? Did you look into her eyes that brilliantly expressed agony and pain through her tormented glances and still managed to tell me it's emotionally detached? It was freaking intense. And swear to me the villain's death by Elizabeth's heroine wasn't empowering and satisfying to watch? It was her character's arc and officially established her as strong female character, even better then Ellen Ripley and Sarah Connor. Who the hell cares if The Protagonist doesn't have an alter ego. Did V from Vendetta reveal his identity? No, and it didn't make him unrelatable. Did the Terminator have a real identity given to him from birth? No, who the hell cares? Did The Doctor from Doctor Who reveal his true name until ten seasons after its debut? Just stop making excuses, dumb critics with baseless opinions."
1874,"Tenets a bit like meeting a woman from a dating site, she looks beautiful and has alot of the attributes you're looking for in a woman but somehow she doesnt quite hit the spot... I definitely wouldn't dump her and I think she'll probably grow on me so I'll think I'll see her again but I'll leave it for a week or two before our next get together."
1875,"The criticisms on this thread are all valid.Sound was spectacular but too noisy - the dialog was hard to follow at times.
The thread of the story is pretty convoluted so you won't be able to follow it in real time, but previous bits will start to make sense as it flows.
The basic concept was original but nearly failed spectacularly.
It also has some elements from Inception - especially the final set-piece.However I still thought it was great. Very good acting from the ensemble, JDW, ED and RP were excellent. KB can be a bit varied, but he was pretty scary in this one.I love it when a director tries something unique and kudos for this attempt as it is unlike any other story I have seen before, and well executed to boot.If your partner is someone who constantly tugs your sleeve during a movie to ask what is going on, best leave them at home. Just go with the flow."
1876,"It is remember me the legend movie INCEPTION.
Cristiphar Nolan the best director ever."
1877,"One of the oldest tricks in the book "" time travel"" , and yet nolan did it his way."
1878,"Yep, you definitely need to watch it twice to get it all... but the next time I will watch it home for sure... The sound mix is really terrible.. since the overall volume was loud in the cinema, the dialogues were ok, but it was nice to have subs. But when the action started it just got way too loud, especially in the last hour I felt like my eardrums will explode as well... Someone please explain, why is it good to mix the sound like this???"
1879,Watched this film next week and at first it was hard to follow but halfway in it fell into place.Eagerly anticipating my second watch two months ago. It has the potential to get one more point.
1880,"The first screening may leave you puzzled due to the complexity of the story and the difficulty to understand dialogues due to noisy surroundings, the cinematic experience itself will be pretty spectacular and breathtaking however.
The second time will allow one to notice major and minor details and will certainly help understand the plot, which will make one realize how pretty damn great this film is, it is simply a masterpiece."
1881,"Lack of plot, character depth & logic holes are weaknesses of Nolan's latest..."
1882,Christopher Nolan does it again. Master storytelling! Superb Film and thumping soundtrack to boot! Definitely enjoyed it second time around. See it again and again.
1883,"Of course Tenet is a great film. Of course Christopher Nolan brings us amazing visuals and great acting. But I can't help myself and be a little disappointed and I think this is because I am more into the topic than in any other Nolan film I watched, mainly because of my admiration of the Netflix series Dark, where they thematized the topic 'time' with perfection. I have watched Tenet just once and I surely missed much, I think every time I watch this movie, I could find some details which are connected to something. Just like Dark, everything is connected, the perfect loop. But Dark goes one step further and sends the protagonists on a journey to change the loop. In the case of Tenet, the antagonist would succeed at first by destroying the world and the protagonists have to change the timeline to stop him. But no, in Tenet they 'only' have to learn how to obey or kind of just be in this perfect loop and everything will be fine for them. Of course the end of the world is not possible in this scenario and it confuses me how the antagonist is not able to understand that. During the film I thought ""of course they succeed, we have already seen the girl jumping from the boat"". When he already has lived at let's say the 20th of June, how can he think ending the world at the 10th of June would be a good idea? It is his future and he does it in his mind the first time, but it is the worlds past and if the world surpassed the 10th of June one time and he saw that, how didn't he know that none of his action would change that. Everything happens over and over again just like it's used to be, which is the main point of Dark. Tenet sends us on a journey to watch a perfect loop where everything is determined from start to end. The ability to travel backwards in time is a cool visual addition, but it's mainly some 'eye candy' for me, it just looks cooler than travel back with an old fashioned time machine and change the actions in your way the second time you are part of it. I assume it also is more likely to happen according to physics, but I don't know anything about that, and it doesn't change my movie experience if something is possible in some way in real life or not. The last negative thing I would like to point out is I would have liked the story to be a little less chaotic and fast paced. It was hard for me to emotionally empathize with the main characters while they are doing something which I don't really understand but it seems like it's necessary to stop the old fashioned bad guy and saving the world by not letting the ""world destroying machine"" doing so. All in all the film is a visual masterpiece, I really enjoyed watching, or better, seeing it and I am sure when you disassemble the film in his individual parts, everything is connected and it is a great story with all the little details hiding from me at my first watch. But everybody who is really interested in watching great storytelling I would highly recommend watching Dark, where in terms of sophistication and complexity, Baran bo Odar and Jantje Friese are, in my opinion, a step ahead of Nolan."
1884,"Tenet is ok film, not great but ok, I liked the action & how it was shot & it was a interesting concept but the characters are so bland, you don't really care about what's going on, everyone is saying Patterson is amazing, he isn't, passable but not the hype he's getting.It's worth a watch maybe people who don't enjoy character development will like it but I think the Nolan fanboys will be hyping this 1 up."
1885,"Firstly, I'll start with I rate Nolan very highly.
Interstellar is current fav film of all time and I have seen it about 8/10 times now and enjoy it every time..Tenet is a another time bending film with a different narrative.I understood the film the more I I thought about it, but don't ask me to explain how bescause I wouldn't know!The biggest problem with this film, just like alot of his other big blockbusters including, Dark Knight Rises, Inception, Interstellar and this is the very poor audio mix, you literally have a dozen or more scenes that speech is virtually inaudible!!I paid £30 for 2 tickets in imax and it was awful, the sounds engineers need sacking!! It's to loud.I have a home cinema system 10.2 atmos setup which is my no means expertly set up but sounds better than this!Nolan I love your films but you really need to sort this out, because I will not see anymore of your films at the cinema until you do! I'd rather wait till they are on blu ray! Disaapointing doesn't cut it..Film it's self 9/10Sound 3/10 and that's a stretch"
1886,"OMG...I'm still in shock how confusing this movie is. I absolutely love Nolan other movies, Interstellar is in my top 5. But this one... Just couldn't follow the story anymore. So many extra plot lines, not really explained or revealed fully. The pumping, loud music is also annoying. Who made this audio mix? Mr Techno? Didn't fit the movie at all. It should have been sg. classical. Great action scenes, great suits. I just loved how well dressed our hero is. Salute to the costume designer. Mixed bag. Enjoyed and not. Maybe second time on Netflix will help..."
1887,"I liked almost everything about this movie and I definitely need/want to watch it again to fully appreciate and understand it.
The only thing that was disappointing was the audio levels."
1888,"I am far from being a film expert and I am not eloquent enough to write a review.
But I love movies and this one had great pictures, a great sound, a very interesting basic idea and good actors...but too often I just found it BORING."
1889,Don't let your eyes and ears off the screen for every single second and you will be satisfied. That's the 'secret'.
1890,"It's better second time round. I had to pay closer attention to the dialogue. It's hard for me the first time round to get to grips with what was happening. But I really enjoyed it twice in a few weeks.
Great to see Tallinn albeit from the main roads and Linnahall.
Have to give huge credit for Nolan attempting a complex structure of a premise but within it a cartoonish plot akin with villain in funny threats. Don't really need those plots or characters (Branagh loves playing Shakespearean type role play).
Still didn't get a sense of emotion from our main lead. But he's charismatic and a good looking chap that can helps being the opposite to the villain's main character. Too many silly type Bond roles would've spoilt it for me.It's really good. Better again."
1891,Nolan's mind is incredible and the results it creates never disappoint. Tenet will definitely please the fans.
1892,"""Tenet"" is a very good movie that I greatly enjoyed but it has some flaws. Starting off with the good stuff: ""Tenet"" is visually stunning, one of the best movies I've ever seen as far as visual choreography and it's pretty remarkable the fact that the majority of what's on the screen is practical and not CGI. Furthermore it has a great score, frenetic action and a masterful direction (I really hope Nolan can finally win an Oscar for best director). All this pros had left me really excited and I can't wait to see it again. Having said all of that ""Tenet"" has two major problems: the hardly comprehensible plot and at times a very bad editing. The plot is good and very interesting, don't get me wrong, and I'd say I pretty much have in mind what happened in the movie, but there's too many intricate things and the rhythm is fast and you will certainly lose some details. I have a genuine curiosity to see the movie at least other two times in order to comprehend clearly what happened. To give an example regarding Nolan's movies I found Inception more accessible at the first view. The second major problem is the editing that is criminal in some scenes: people talking that change positions after a cut, some cuts that interrupt important dialogues, missing links between scenes. But other than these two things, ""Tenet"" is a very good movie and we only can thank directors like Nolan that have the bravery not to choose a safe movie but try to experiment with this art in a blockbuster movie. So go watch it if you can and if you are safe!"
1893,"Definitely a must see for all Nolan fans. Starts off a little confusing, but eventually becomes more understandable. Highly recommend."
1894,"Awesome film. I'll try not to spoil it too much for you 'muricans (us Aussies got it first!). The weak points first:
Some ""questionable"" casting (by that, I mean could have been better, not that they're bad): namely Washington, Caine (in a completely pointless appearance), & the perpetually hammy Branagh (WHY people think this guy is some sort of a thespian is beyond me. Someone like Fassbender could have hit this role out of the park and made it one of the greatest villain roles ever put to screen; in the hands of Branagh, it becomes just another cliched foreign bad guy).
Also, though it is a very complex intelligent twisty turney plot, it is a little too pretentious for its own good. It really needed the expert balance of complexity, vision, and soul that Jonathan Nolan's capable of (he has nothing to do with this, and you can tell).
But 2 things make this film a must-see: Christopher Nolan's directing, and I don't know who did the score for this, but it wasn't Zimmer (I know, I'm shocked too). However, they did a great job of sounding like Zimmer! Awesome score.MILD SPOILER ALERT BELOW:
And Chris Nolan's directing is definitely on point here: it took a lot from The Dark Knight & Interstellar, so if you liked the directing of those two, you will love this! BY FAR the best aspect of the film.
But the writing could definitely have benefited from a little Jonathan Nolan touching up. There's extremely little focus on character development (you don't REALLY care about any of the characters), & the dialogue could have been better written (again, it's not BAD - just not Jonathan Nolan good).
Definitely worth a see though! Awesome directing."
1895,"Ok so it's incredible. It's very very hard to understand. At least 3 times harder that inception.
John Washington is incredible in it.
Mind blown though, need to watch it a few more times.
Like it will win oscars, I don't know how many, Defo on visual effects for one.
It's slick it's cool. It's just a total mind bender
8/10"
1896,The dialogue was very difficult to follow but most everything else was superb if you like twisty mind bending . Just that struggle to follow the dialogue disappointed .
1897,Christopher Nolan is no doubted the most original moviemaker of our time. Tenet is yet again another mindblowing movie from him. Only one thing is bothering me.I. Just. Didn't. Get. It.
1898,"So the day has finally come, 5 months after seeing my last film in the cinema, I have returned to watch the new blockbuster Tenet and here is my review for this film. The premise of the film sees a man have to travel the world in an effort to stop World War 3, but he is only armed with a word - Tenet and he has no idea what he is getting in to.Main Character
John David Washington plays The Protagonist here, no seriously that is his characters name. He is really great here, he gives a really strong performance, we follow this guy all over the world on a journey and you will care about him and really want to see him succeed. He has plenty of charisma here and swagger that you buy him as a leading man straight away and will see much more of him in the future.Supporting Characters
Robert Pattinson has had a good week, after the brilliant first trailer for The Batman and now his fantastic performance here. He has so much charisma too, the partnership with him and Washington is the real highlight of this film, they are great together and it is great to see two younger actors thriving in this large blockbuster. Elizabeth Debicki has a large role and I think this is the best I have seen her, her character has the real emotion here, you care about her and want to see her personal story resolved in a positive way. Kenneth Branagh plays the villain, and just like Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit he is playing a Russian and I do think his accent is pretty decent. He does a good job in coming across as the aggressive and intense bad guy and adds to this film very nicely. Himesh Patel and Aaron Taylor Johnson also do good jobs in there smaller roles.Story
Now this is the part of the review that will be really short as I knew pretty much nothing about the plot and that is the way you have to watch this movie. The story is really interesting in different ways that I will not get into, but the film is also really convoluted, most of it makes sense but it is sometimes a film that is quite hard to follow. I think this films plot will be better when you watch this film on its second watch-through.
Script
The character dialogue for the script is really well done. The relationships between them is handled well and you do care about the characters and the perils that they are put into. But some of the dialogue that explains the plot didn't really work for me, I mean there was never a part of the film where they dumb the plot down even a little bit and that can again make it hard follow.Style
The style of the film is fantastic, this is a film that was born to be watched on the cinema screen, don't watch this on a tablet or phone or even your TV, if you can go and appreciate it on the big screen. The action scenes are brilliant, they flow incredibly well and the unique story element allows them to get creative and add excitement. Also this film is 2 hours 30 mins long but I was never bored once, the pacing is great and even though this film is long and a tiring watch it is never dull or too slow.Overall
Overall, this is a great Christopher Nolan film, though I thought it was more in the Interstellar bracket of quality then Inception. However, I think on repeat viewings this film could be better and better, even raising the ranking higher so I would implore if you are a film fan and can, go and see this film and support the cinemas as it is worth a watch."
1899,"Everything in this movie is awesome! The action, the score, the visuals, the acting and Robert is so handsome."
1900,"I wasn't surprised when I left the movie theatre thinking: I'm gonna have to watch this one again. And again. And again. Because I sat down in the movie theatre thinking: I am probably going to have to watch this more than once. Like with most of Nolan's movies. Because once I really understand his movies, when I see all the little details, appreciate every shot, every word and the complexity of it all - I love it.I was disappointed to learn that my favourite composer, and Christopher Nolan's faithful movie composer, Hans Zimmer wasn't going to score this movie. But I was calm and intrigued when I found out Ludwig Göransson was. And boy did he have me convinced I was in for a ride after the first five minutes. The music is loud and immense and sometimes irritating. Especially when you can hear how the music is telling you this right here is awesome and brilliant and you understand f*ck all. Because 85% of the time, I really didn't. However, I thought I for sure understood that casting Kenneth Branagh was a huge mistake but the more I saw him the more I started to understand that I didn't understand that either, because it certainly was not a mistake casting him.I can safely say: I was there, I saw it, I felt it, I liked it, I didn't get it but it was a ride! It was like a dance at times and like a hangover at other times.
That being said; I am not convinced Tenet is too smart for me. I did get the end but I needed more to understand the freaking middle. Sometimes it felt like when a teacher changes a slide in the PowerPoint presentation because ""you all get this, I don't have to explain this to you"". And you're left not understanding because you weren't given the chance to understand.The more I think about it I am convinced that I missed a vital scene or a sentence when I was trying to figure out if I should continue eating the popcorn or start with the chocolate. Anyway, I will watch it again and atleast then I'll be prepared for when the teacher (Nolan) is going to change the slide, so I can hurry up and take some notes."
1901,"It´s a shame that Nolan has ended up being carried away by Hollywwood's silly action films.The script is at the service of the action scenes, (and not the other way around, as was the case in the excellent Memento), so what you can get is not more than the old same boring story: Good guys, bad guys. The good guys have to save the girl in the middle of many shots and explosions that shred your ears ..... as you can see, just another Hollywood action flick very similar to a video game."
1902,"Back to the future to save the past, or back to the past to save the future?? Without a doubt. this is the most uncomprehensible movie I've ever seen. No acting, toilet paper thin characters, too much CGI (what else is new) and a Hans Zimmer score that is so lt practically drowns out what the characters are trying to say. Only two action pieces that you'll forget as soon as you leave the multiplex, and they only seem like fillers to move along the story somewhat. If you thought 'Dunkirk' was awful, it almost seems like David Lean next to this mess. Call this a 'social distancing' movie. Just socially distance yourself FAR away from this fiasco. Not worth wearing a face mask for two and a half hours. Yet another P.U. review from Lou."
1903,"Nolan went south with this movie. The concepts he is exploring are too complex to grasp for a common viewer (or a licensed scientist). I am not sure if a degree in physics or some related field would be sufficient to get the plot fully.Main villain story is just lazy, and his motivation to destroy the world, I am just gonna say it, is idiotic. Characters are not developed at all, he just focused on the story.Long story short, I dont want to be forced to learn a new field of physics every time his movie comes out. Inception was fun, same as Memento, because concepts were more or less easy to follow, but this movie is just not worth it.Worst thing of all: people are giving it rating 8 or 9. I am pretty sure its because they couldnt follow the story and see the nonsense he gave us in this movie, but to afraid to admit it."
1904,I am a great fan of Nolan and particularly love Inception. Yet Tenet is a great disappointment to me!
1905,"A mindblowing film, but only because of the noisy soundtrack, that is hammering your brain out. The story is not that complicated but Nolan possesses the impertinence to direct it intentionally tricky it seems. A simple but appealing story about time travel bloated to the next theory of relativity. It's all smoke and mirrors!"
1906,I love Nolan's work what with Dunkirk and Batman and Inception but I expected a better story line for Tenet. The art of a great screenplay it to make something complex easy. This movie is simply complicated and should have had a second writer to make Nolan understandable.
1907,"What the heck was this movie about? Anything goes! I know Nolan is a master of complexity like running 3 scenes at the same time but due to the poor audio mixing, couldn't follow at all. In addition Branagh as a Russian! That was a joke! Waste of time - in an empty theater with supposedly state of the art sound, couldn't follow half the dialogues. Epic fail!"
1908,"Reel Tunez Movie Review (9/12/20): ""Tenet""
Reel Tunez... The Radio Show All About the MoviesWhere to start? All I can say is ""oh wow!"".. followed quickly by ""what a WASTE of 2 1/2 hours!"" This movie had the continuity of throwing a puzzle down a garbage disposal, running it for 5 minutes (with the water on), then TRYING to make that puzzle into ANYTHING that makes sense!I wondered about the movie editing and whether it was even pointless to attempt to edit it into something that anyone could follow!Shots were pretty... and effects were good. Audio was very good and production values high. But acting wasn't great.. and story was a fricken mess!I saw this with my 19 year old daughter (who is into parallel timeline stories and such) and even she said it made NO SENSE!I LOVE sci-fi and adventures.. and this had both. But this thing was a mess from the second the movie started. It has high reviews, but I give it some serious thumbs down action! On a 1 to 10 scale (10 is best), I'd give this thing about a 3.5. It was simply awful!"
1909,"Bad choice for imax, really miss old times when people really cared about story and performances, instead digital effects. Cliche setting, a ""tearing-down-Russian-empire-by-we-Americans"" shell. Worst of all, hardly to understand a single piece of those mumbles. Too loud and too many twists, I got carsickness in a cinema."
1910,"10/10.This is Nolan's most complicated movie.Mix of action and sci-fi. There's so many things that I didn't understand. Writting this an hour after watching the movie in cinema.I'll definitely watch this one more time and see the reviews.You should definitely watch this without any hesitation.Don't know why is it 8/10 points, probably cause of people didn't understand it."
1911,"My first watching convinced me this was the best film I'd seen for some years, the second watching confirmed it was the best I'd ever seen. It seems people rating this low are not willing to try and understand this complex yet perfect/intricate storyline. Every sentence of dialogue carries meaning later on, every scene as clever as the next; if you really concentrate, this film enters another league. Once you understand this film, you understand it's greatness - this is truly cinematography and story telling and its best."
1912,"... he has a fundamental inclination to make very bad or very good movies.
This one is a ""-""
i won;t waste more time on it, the lack of fundamental logic is obivious from the start. And i am not talking about lack of science logic. That comes as second """"-"""".Trying to be constructive: the thing that brought me something was the end - very powerful despite the bad construction till that point"
1913,"It's as if they came up with an idea to build the movie on and just ran with it. This is what this movie is. A single gimmick movie. It's like a baby of his previous movies; Inception (another single gimmick movie, not that its bad), Memento (timeline moving forwards and backwards) and Interstellar (butchering the dialogue mix). If this film was called Mission Impossible: Time Protocol (or something along those lines) starring Tom Cruise it would just be considered a decent spy/action movie which is what it is.If you have to see the movie 3 times to able to unravel its boring and messy story like that drawer you have full of cables, that doesn't make it a smart movie. And even if you like the idea of trying to unravel complex stories, there have been many movies in the past that did this without needing a billion dollar budget (Primer).I do have to give credit to cool fighting and car chasing scenes though. Very impressive.A bad Russian guy who has a bad weapon is trying destroy the world while the good guys try to stop him from being a bad husband."
1914,"There is one thing and action and science fiction movie shouldn't do: Bore the audience over almost 2 hours of its running time
Making a story out of Interstellar left overs isn't the biggest mistake IMHO Nolan did, but he obviously overestimated the visual rewarding of time shifts and parallel worlds."
1915,"Can be loud at times, but overall the movie is a masterpiece. Breathtaking. Mind Blowing. The movie is intense but not violent. Highly recommend."
1916,"Could have been great but it just looses the viewer.
Sound is not great in some scenes."
1917,"Now listen, I usually start off my reviews by briefly covering what the plot is about but in case of Tenet, which has one of the most conplicated plots ever put to film, I'll just say that it is a scifi espionage thriller.Christopher Nolan is one of my favourite directors and, in my opinion, one of the greatest of all time. His movies are intelligent, under the surface and puzzling but there is a certain limit to all of that. Like for instance Inception or better yet Memento, these are complicated movies but yet comprehensable. I think that Tenet crossed the line where the plot is too complex for people to really be entertained with the movie.
Of course I have to give credit for excellent acting, direction and visuals but this is in my opinion one of Nolan's worst, not a bad movie but not nearly his best."
1918,Genius and mind blowing movie. Nolan did it again he created an upgraded version of Inception
1919,"Give a $1B budget to any other directors on this planet, they couldn't get past the screenplay of Tenet. To he able to pull off this kind of storytelling in a two and half hour movie itself is a miracle.The last time I remember telling myself walking out the theatre ""that was the craziest thing I've ever seen in my life"" was James Cameron's Avatar. Tenet takes it to a whole new level of storytelling that is reminiscent of Memento (not as much as Inception).Is it confusing? Yes. Is it difficult to follow? Yes. Does it have any contradictions? HELL NO. I am still thinking about it and marvel at this man's way of thinking.If you have any respect for the creative craft of storytelling narrative, this movie is not possible with our linear way of thinking. Christopher Nolan is the star of the movie and I absolutely respect his vision and the leadership to pull this off."
1920,"Just Watched this movie still trying to wrap my ahead around it is way too confusing.Were just thrown into the action right away with choppy cut scenes, bullets flying and there in no explanation or backstory whatsoever, everything just happens. Nothing ever makes sense and nothing is ever explained.The audio of this movie is embarrassing. You have characters whispering to each other with loud background music, so its nearly impossible to hear what they are saying.The characters were boring and one dimensional, they had absolutely no background story whatsoever and a real lack of emotion was displayed.This movie basically falls flat on its face, the movie could be interesting if it made sense but it did not."
1921,"Nolan is one of the best directors of our generation. I agree the plot of Tenet is pretty hard to follow in the first viewing. It was hard for me too. So basically the viewer has to watch the movie twice, watch 'Tenet explained' videos on youtube, read 'Tenet explained' articles on reddit and then watch the movie one more time. Then you will appreciate the movie!..The time travel in this movie is basically like in the movie Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban..Going back to the past doesn't change the past because the past already happened. All i can say is watch this movie folks!!!"
1922,"It has all the excitement and coldness of a spy movie, done with extraordinary set pieces and solid performances by the lead. Nolan is a master in weaving labyrinthine scripts and pulling off so effectively that it'd be impossible to imagine otherwise.With TENET Nolan has marked his position along with the likes of Hitchcock & Kubrick.What a way to head back to movie theaters after 6 months of exile!"
1923,"I'll start off with saying it's not often that I love Christopher Nolan's stuff. Don't get me wrong they're all amazing but Tenet really takes it to the next level. I love plot twists in movies and sometimes one of the worst things is when you know those plot twists are coming. With Tenet you know they're coming but your actually excited for them to happen. I personally was intrigued with every new twist to get further into the world of Tenet.John David Washington does an amazing job as the leading man. Any time the man shows emotion you can't help but believe him. Robert Pattinson, as always, delivers a great performance and his reveal at the end (which I won't reveal) was great because although you do suspect it, it is still exciting to see it happen.All and all a superb cast, amazing directing and writing, and a new world that I hope we get to explore more."
1924,Mind blowing movie. Masterpiece.You would have to watch it multiple times to admire the details and you can not understand it without feeling it.Christopher Nolan delivers more than we expected from TENET.Thank you Mr. Nolan.
1925,"I seen it as if, Nolan is crazy, similar concept but so different. Maybe in 5 years we will start saying things are tenet just like we say things are inception."
1926,A poor attempt to adapt Dark into a basic Hollywood blockbuster action movie. If u find that movie complicated or hard u are just an average viewer. Really disappointing.
1927,"Outstanding cinema, hopefully will have a significant contribution in reviving a damaged industry. Props to Nolan and WB for holding their nerve and getting this released properly."
1928,"Worth years of waiting, it's amazing how nolan keep doing it every time, a historical performance from elizabeth debicki, kenneth branagh, cinematography was epic as expected from ,hoyte van hoytema who did an incredible job taking my breath away running and flipping all the time, i was literally on the edge of my seat for two and a half hours"
1929,"Suspenseful for sure, but I feel it was way too convoluted and confusing than it needed to be. Too many timeline jumps and back and forths. The film 'Inception' did a similar concept rather well- this movie lost me toward the middle."
1930,This movie was truly amazing in spite the fact that you need to have 3 PhDs in completely different fields in order to get some of it.
1931,"I think they messed up this movie. Conceptless
It rotten my brain."
1932,"A wonderfully meaty script that doesn't reveal itself fully with only one viewing but reveals its gifts slowly with repeated viewings. Then, once you get it, it all fits together seamlessly and you're amazed at his craftsmanship. Great locations, terrific action, and Nolan's usual terrific use of the moving camera and intense action choreography make this a great watch, a kind of updated James Bond with this great sci fi story. Really, I don't understand the meh reviews, but you do need to see it more than once."
1933,I didn't realise I need PhD in quantum physics to enjoy that movie.
1934,"Somebody said ""Don't try to understand it, just feel it"". He was right but what is the point if you cannot understand it. Its a typical Nolan movie. You have to prepare yourself to watch it more than once to understand. Amazing visual and sound but too loud. Don't try to understand it when you watch first time, believe me just feel it."
1935,"Nolan, is a great film maker, particularly for insomnia, dark knight and inception.But he's steadily been getting too pretentious for his own good and the films are suffering as a result.Tenet was a distaster in my opinion, the visual execution on screen was great but the writing and sheer entertainment make it an absolute mess."
1936,"The beginning of the end. Something is said to have ""jumped the shark"" when it has reached its peak and begun a downhill slide to mediocrity or oblivion"
1937,"I usually enjoy the work of Christopher Nolan, albeit not a die-hard fan like some people.I get it, this film is complex and puzzle-like, and probably best enjoyed with a couple viewings or more. But since the story feels so disjointed I couldn't really get a feel for any of the characters until perhaps at the very end, if that even.I usually have an issue with time travel (or time going backwards in this case, potatoes tomatoes) in stories because it's quite impossible to get it right. Too many unanswered questions in the science of it all and too many aspects of it just not making any sense whatsoever. Sure, all things doesn't have to be explained in minutiae. I like sci-fi and it doesn't always have to make perfect sense. But it all gets a bit more difficult when the only thing that carries you through the story is the fact that you're trying to make sense of it, at all.Questions to ponder: if they're moving backwards in time, wouldn't each and every motion be backwards? Why don't they speak in reverse? Furthermore, how do you isolate your own body from the world around you? What is it even with us humans and wanting to think of ourselves as separate from the world around us? Does the bacteria in the protagonists bowels live in reverse too? How would that affect his metabolism? If breathing can't be done without damaging the lungs, what wouldn't sweating be like? What about causality? What's these nuclear materials got to do with anything? Why would they cause causality to start going backwards? I guess theoretically the world COULD be inverted, but certainly not just separate parts of it. Everything ties together. Plus, as we all know, the past and the future is just a human concept. There is only now, always.That, and so much more, was basically my internal dialogue throughout this film, and it didn't help that I didn't care much for the people in it so there was nothing to steal my focus away from just questioning everything.I'm not a physicist but all of this just seems so implausible, when at the same time it tries so hard to make sense and paint a coherent picture, and that I think, is my biggest gripe. I can watch superheroes all day and not question a thing, but they're rarely this pretentious.There's nothing wrong with just telling a great story in a good way. I wish more directors felt this.6/10, and that's mainly because of the special effects and the fact that they manage to sew this plot together at all."
1938,"For me Tenet is equivalent to Inception, one need to be patient and very particular to details while watching Nolan movies. Pre-Interval events were perfectly woven with post-interval events.
Really, Bravo."
1939,"This film had potential, the action scenes were extremely impressive and that's about all this film is going for. The storyline is average at best, way too confusing for it's own sake, but once you learn everything, it's far not as great as it hyped us. The characters are very bland, unmemorable and as generic as they come. This film could have been a lot better."
1940,"If you like puzzle solving the whole time and try to uncover the complexity of time travel thing with a new environmental effects then this movie is for you. However, be aware that there is nothing more than that. That's all. Of course there are some action scenes but I don't think anyone watches it looking for action. Also, while you finally get to solve the puzzle probably after watching it more than once, there is nothing very magnificent about it. only pieces of the story that you manage to put them in the right way.So, I personally didn't find it interesting. so what? If I wanted to solve a puzzle I would have bought a proper tool. But as I said, you may like it to solve a puzzle movie. And one more thing, do not look for mystery in this movie. nothing like a mysterious concept reveals no matter how much you dig in or watch again. the mystery is the time complexity itself. As I said there is nothing more. As for the scifi aspects, there is only one hint to an algorithm from the future that is making things happening the way you see them. that's all. I give it some credits for adding the new environmental effects to time travel (reversing concept) but nothing else."
1941,"This movie tries too hard to be too clever... There is a point you give up trying to understand the movie, you just watch it til the end because you already started, but you don´t give a damn about the plot anymore, just want the movie to end...The 2:30 hours felt like an eternity."
1942,"No I guess I haven't.
Unless you are Nolan's cousin do not expect to understand the movie.
I have come here only after the first watch, I will revisit after the second third or fourth.Action is awesome, music gives you goosebumps, acting is superb."
1943,"I don't want to say it's one of Nolan's worst films beacause it's still a very good film, but when he is one of the best filmmakers of all time, comparing these to all these other masterpieces he has made makes it look bad by comparison. This movie isn't one you will fully understand by watching it once, it really needs at least two times to really get the whole essence and meaning of it. It starts off really promising with clever sci-fi tech and Nolan showing off what he can really do, the second act really messes the mind of the viewers but watching it twice really helps you understand the whole physics jibber jabber that you have to accept to really enjoy it. I am a person that thinks you should just accept the physics of a movie and try to see if the use it for a good cause and in Tenet they really do, amazing time manipulations and different uses of it, so many that you will leave really satisfied if you are into this kind of sci-fi. Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki really steal the show, they are just a pleasure to watch and it's a pitty I can't say the same about John David Washington, I really wanted to love him in this but unfortunately his role needs the badass acting of a great action stars and he really doesn't give you that. As of direction and cinematography it's one of the best films to look at, breathtaking pictures, landscapes, sets and use of color and camera movement, Nolan leaves the audience once again stunned with his capability of making something beautiful. The only problem with this movie is that it has a very classic spy theme story that just gets bigger with the sci-fi stuff,but I can't say I liked it more than movies like the last MI films or Skyfall, so it sacrifices the entertainment to be clever and in the end entertainment is the key to success in these films. Genrally, I wouldn't call it a miss, but surely less than I expected, I still believe it's a very good movie, but I really wanted it to be perfect."
1944,"Inception was fantastic and Interstellar was fantastic as well, in terms of cinematography, but also in terms of being fantastic films... Tenet however isn't a fantastic film, it's just a good one.For the vast majority of the film, the viewer is left confused and confuzzled. The start is confusing, the end is confusing, and most of everything in-between is confusing too... It's just a very confusing film. With that being said, it's a very visually impressive film (like almost all of Nolan's films). The sequences that feature the 'Tenet mechanic' are very impressive and without it the film would barely be a 7/10 film.Throughout the film, there are supposed 'curve balls' or 'plot twists' that are thrown at the viewer, but I managed to predict at least 4 of them, which really blunted any of the 'surprise' that the film makers intended on inflicting upon the viewer. This doesn't really come down to the viewer being 'smart', it just comes down to the film makers not being smart enough.Overall it's a good action film: Lots of fighting and lots of explosions. It's not anywhere close as being as good as Inception or Interstellar, but it's still pretty good. 8/10, and would even warrant a 2nd viewing since you probably would be less-confused on the 2nd viewing and thus things would make more sense."
1945,"It requires quite a bit of exposition, but by the time the concept comes into play, you're grateful for it. Tenet was a very well orchestrated and fresh approach on time travel, that does require more than one viewing. It's really hard to understand some of the later establishing shots when some of the scenes are supposed to be inverted people and conventional people in the same place, but when you know what you're looking at it all falls into line quite well. I'm sure it will be more enjoyable on Blu-ray with subtitles."
1946,"This seems like a film based on a filming technique. The plot revolves around a device that allows people and things to travel backwards in time, passed on from the future. It touches on the paradox this gives, but provides no explanation.
A billionaire has the a weapon from the future that will destroy all life on earth and decides to use it because he's dying. There's no explanation of why he'd do this. It relies on the idea of the evil genius who just wants to destroy for no reason. He has an army of people working for him, with no explanation of why they would given that he's going to kill them all.
While an unreliable plot can actually add to a film, such as Momento, or fantastic effects can add to an impenetrable plot, such as Inception, or can be ignored for a fun plot, like Terminator, this does not achieve any of these.
And at 2 and a half hours this is far too long. A good hour could have been lost with no detrimental cost."
1947,"The longer this pandemic situation continues the worse quality movies we will see in the near future.
Fortunately for the Director, the Nolandogs (His fun club)support him big otherwise he would get a lot of tomatoes.
I think he is a charismatic screenwriter but as a director you lose himself in the abyss of his screenplay.
Bad Very Bad acting by Washington jr with lots of imitations from who else..his father!"
1948,"This movie like Inception & Interstellar needs to be watched at least 2 times & if not 3.
U will enjoy every bit of it, trust me."
1949,"Big fan of most of Nolan's work, but this is abysmal.
58 minutes to go and the movie has lost me completely. Not the concept, not the story, just the god-damn AWFUL sound mixing. All the top notch acting and performances are ruined. All nuance that might have made it enjoyable is lost. I should have put subtitles on, but the sound still is awful to sit through, and I shouldn't have to for an English movie.
On a side note, the plot is terribly drawn out too for the first half.
49 minutes to go..."
1950,If you want to understand this movie watch inception in reverse
1951,"A lot of references: Matrix, Jason Bourne, Back to the Future, but it is the perfect script for a modern game like Call of Duty. Till the end you receive all the answers. Good rhythm, photograph and effects. Kind of movie that inspires."
1952,"Whilst I appreciated what Nolan was trying to achieve with this film I have to say it fails on too many levels to be just accepted as a success. Don't get me wrong, its not a bad film, but its sci-fi mistakes with time/entropy and physics in general are laughable at best.The acting is top notch, especially from Robert Pattison and John Washington. The script is above par too, but it's let down by stupidly choreographed action scenes which try too hard to ""do something new for the sake of it"".And as for the entire moving backwards lark...........give me a break!"
1953,While you watch the movie what exactly is happening becomes clearer and clearer
1954,Good novel story but the movie was way too long for no apparent reason
1955,"Thank God for the pandemic in order for such a terrible movie to be released and still make money, the film is choppy, obviously Nolan had to cut time but it ruins the background and story."
1956,"No, it's not ""complicated"". No, it's not ""ironic"". It's Nolan testing his narcissism. Cut it to 90 minutes and maybe - MAYBE - it would be a worthy film. I doubt I'll ever give another Nolan film even a cursory view."
1957,"Okay, so not a perfect Nolan. But still, in my top 3 Nolans(yes like a painter). Tenet is a very complex movie which at times will feel like it's wrong or it has changed the scenes or the sense of it, but after studying those scenes, it will become clear that some of the scenes were correct and actually made sense.Some still felt a little wrong at point but I don't know maybe I didn't get them. We know it was classic Nolan- Mind bending Sci Fi with smooth action and shots of landscape. But, where it was not Nolan, I'm listing those points-1. It was weirdly loud and some words were lost in it. Though I watched with subtitles and it was easy then.2. The story arc was not great and was a little repetitive- Saving the world from ending.3. Dialogues were fairly weak- ""If I can't have you no one can"" or comedy ones like ""Where I'm from you buy a dinner first"".4. Acting was not a stront suit of the movie. Dimple Kapadia fell flat absolutely flat and I didn't think John Washington was ready for a titular role of this calibre yet.5. Absence of Hans Zimmer.I want to give this movie an 8.5, not a complete 9. I watched this movie only once in it's entirety, and then rewatched some of the scenes to grab the sense. Still, I think some scenes didn't make sense. For example why they went to Oslo when they could have switched back to the timeline in the same garage area because they already switched once when they brought the girl back. Idk.I won't be searching for answers on youtube or google though. I like the way I understood the movie. Ans yes, great cinematography by Hoyte, as always.If you liked my points, give a thumbs up. Cheers."
1958,"With all the negative reviews I've heard I went into this movie with low expectations, but boy was I pleasantly surprised! The acting was great, the plot was interesting, and was overall entertaining!"
1959,"It's overrated and disappointing. Its general idea is not new or original but what's special about it is the storytelling. The story definitely seems smart and complicated but it's just dumb to me because of all the disturbingly sophisticated lines and terms, and the exaggerated confusing complexity that kills all the fun. I mean what's the point of making a movie that probably most people won't get or feel? Also character development is so weak which refrained the acting abilities of great actors like Robert Pattinson and John David Washington. As for the original score it is nice but it's annoying since it's so loud that we could barely hear what the actors are saying. Also the running time is another issue, it's so long which makes you more bored and uninterested. The only beautiful thing about this movie is the stunning cinematography."
1960,"Others have mentioned the terrible sound mixing on this film. I watched it with subtitles on, which was somewhat helpful. Overall, I found the film underwhelming in the end.Other reviewers mentioned the characters were like cardboard cutouts. I don't disagree with this sentiment. The protagonist, Kat and Neil were there in the service of the main conceit of the film, time travel and its ramifications. A film that isn't character driven should have better backstory/dialogue than this, however. As an aside, Pattinson was very good in the film. That was a welcome surprise.After Inception and Memento, I should have expected something like this. Not a film like the Batman trilogy with Christian Bale. According to two talking heads on network television, this film ""underperformed"" at the box office. During the worst pandemic in 100 years, that was bound to happen.I expect Chris Nolan to be up to his not so old tricks in the not too distant future. In the meantime, I will have to make do with his brother's series, Person of Interest. To my eyes (and ears), five seasons of Reese, Finch, Shaw and Root are better than Tenet."
1961,"When you substract the incessant action scenes, the CGI and the quickly-thrown-in dialogs that have no permittance to linger, this movie leaves you with an empty stomach and an ADHD sickness. Don't look for anything scientific or any further ramifications from the gimick with the time inversion, it's just an unexplored idea to make the movie sound interesting.
Conclusion: Watching definitely not recommended."
1962,"Armed with the word Tenet and an overbearing threat of the end of the world, we follow John David Washington (Blackkklansman) as he discovers the power of time inversion and all the visually spectacular prospects that concept can bring. However, the real draw for film fans is the question of what happens when Christopher Nolan takes Memento, Inception and James Bond and merges it with top-of-their-game actors, a Hans Zimmer impersonator and full monetary backing from Warner Bros. The answer is Tenet, the newest time-based sci-fi action film from Christopher Nolan.Tenet, to put it mildly, is a lot to wrap a first-time viewer's head around. It acts, in a bizarre way, like an educational course. The first act is the lesson, exemplified by characters throwing heaps upon heaps of exposition at the audience in an attempt to get them ready for the coursework of the second act and the exam of the third act. As such (like with exams) it helps to know the answers beforehand which is why that (perhaps by design) Tenet is improved greatly upon a second watch. Trust me, the opening concert scene makes more sense with a second viewing.If there is one thing Christopher Nolan is a master of, it is spectacle and Tenet has this in spades. With its' central concept of inversion and time reversal, Tenet can put visual twists on common concepts to make them feel new, exciting and viscerally thrilling. Whether this is a fist fight, a car chase or a full-scale armed assault, Tenet is able to use its' time reversal technique to keep the film visually impressive, regardless of whether audiences understand what's going on or not. Thankfully, along with impressive (and mostly practical) visuals, John David Washington inhabits a charismatic protagonist that rarely fails to lose the audience's investment in the plot. Furthermore, Robert Pattinson successfully crushes any doubts surrounding his upcoming role as The Batman/ Bruce Wayne with his supremely sophisticated yet deadly 'Neil'.However, Tenet is far from the best Nolan has created. It lacks the emotional attachment that inhabited Interstellar, the perfect pacing of The Dark Knight or the innovative storytelling of Memento. Furthermore, any praise that could be given to its' dialogue is not possible as multiple scenes have background music and sound effects which drown out voices via some horrendous sound mixing (did anyone hear the boat race scene in its' entirety?). This does all unite to make a film that, whilst techinically, visually and narratively (insofar that it's not completely incomprehensible) impressive, is ultimately very hollow in executionOverall, even with the aforementioned limitations, due to the film's ability to consistently provide additional information upon re-watch, I would not be surprised if Tenet slowly crept up the ranks to become a classic amongst Nolan's collection (or at the very least a cult classic). Still, regardless of my thoughts on the film, I was just happy to be back in a cinema again tbh."
1963,"I thought maybe my brain got a bit dim because of Covid and that's why I couldn't understand a damn thing that happened, but I leaned over about half way in and asked my smart boyfriend if he understood and he replied ""Not really"". It was nice to get out and gorge on popcorn and be wowed by a big screen, but....I didn't get it. At all. Not even a little. Something with a fake art piece and a nuclear weapon and some skinny chick and things moving backwards."
1964,"Tenet is another ambitious project from the prolific writer/director Christopher Nolan. I'm not as familiar with Nolan's filmography as I would like to be, only having seen his Dark Knight trilogy, Inception, and Dunkirk before. I was warm on Dunkirk but loved his tackling of Batman in a more grounded world, as well as the dreamscape of reality that was Inception.In fact Tenet almost feels like a companion piece to the aforementioned Inception. Both are incredibly high concept sci-fi, mess with reality and perception, and slowly loop back reveals to the viewer. Unfortunately I found Tenet to be, while visually stunning, ultimately lacking in any compelling story and insistent on showing off characters who seemed to be the same model with a new coat of paint.Nolan handles the ideas in his head expertly. But these ideas never seem to flourish like they should when put onscreen. In a film like Inception (which I rewatched for its anniversary only few weeks before Tenet) the ideas feel much better communicated, without just info-dumping the world onto the audience. In Tenet there are several discussions of inversion, but none of these seemed to match the clarity and engagement I got from Inception. This got me feeling very left behind while trying to cling onto the rapid pace of the film.That's another issue: the editing is very choppy and the music is overbearing. Dialogue is drowned out by Ludwig Göransson's heavy score and that then hurts the plot's movement by setting the audience behind the character. And that is if these scenes do move the plot. Some will only run for a minute and then move on, without any real story being continued at all. It felt like there was only some strands of connective tissue between the scenes and led to character motivations becoming weak and fuzzy.The cinematography is very well done. Plenty of iconic shots and movements. Nolan knows his framing and equipment, even in the fast-paced, always moving action sequences.The characters are weak as well. The Protagonist, played by John David Washington, is your standard main character, and I have no issue with that. But the side characters are very much the same.Robert Pattinson's character, Neil, is woefully underused. There's supposed to be a friendship blooming between the two, but the Protagonist is also very mistrusting of him the entire time. So there's this tension that never seems to break, even when Neil tells the Protagonist they're good friends. They lack a convincing growth, especially when Neil keeps popping in and out of the movie's plot.Speaking of unconvincing relationships, Elizabeth Debicki's character, Katherine, is supposedly building a romantic bond with the Protagonist. Only the romance is stale and lifeless, with barely any chemistry. Add to this her rivalry with her cartoonishly evil husband Sator, played by Kenneth Branagh, and she comes off as a very one note stereotypical love interest.The dialogue is rather bland. Every character talks the same, with witty remarks and one-liners, and every conversation moves at the same pace and rhythm no matter the situation around them.The action scenes are grand set pieces, and the way they're executed is amazing. Nolan can do practical effects like no one else, and he constantly keeps raising the stakes for himself. The plane crash is definitely the highlight of the film, with the last action scene added on as well. I feel these scenes would be better by themselves, however, rather than snaking the plot through them. Especially during the last action scene where everything happens at once and yet somehow still feels all over the place.I was very much looking forward to Tenet. The fighting with its reversed choreography, the practical effects, the grand action and the espionage. But unfortunately it got so wrapped up in its own cliches and cleverness that everything fell short of my expectations. Here's hoping Nolan delivers something even stronger in his next film.6/10"
1965,"Weird blockbuster. The first 30 minutes are great, even though you have no idea what's going on, it engages you. Action scenes start out surprisingly amazing, with the reverse combar being actually fun to watch. Honestly the movie did great early on and ended quite well, but it's on its halfway point where it slows down and prolongs itself unnecessarily. Not a bad movie by any means, just a tad pretentious and 30 min longer than necessary."
1966,I have never thought about time the way that it is explained and used in this movie. It is definitely worth watching multiple times and will make you think
1967,"One of those movies you might want to watch a second time, although I wish I hadn't seen it just to experience it again"
1968,"Plot: 7, Sound Mixing: 2, Dialog: IDK, see sound mixing"
1969,"I wish if there is negative stars to give to this Terrible movie, so I would give it -5 stars and -50 stars to this Terrible actor!
worst movie ever..."
1970,"Tenet is the movie that had everybody pacing back in forth anxiously to see all the way back since 2017 when Dunkirk first came out. That year people were wondering what will the next big Nolan feature be? Now that moment is finally here for many people to enjoy.Tenet is about the protagonist (John David Washington) finding out about this technology named Tenet that will put people back in time. It isn't like you would expect though. The way that they go back in time is through rewinding everything around them. They do this so they can plant things in certain areas. Sounds confusing right? Also with that, Sator (Kenneth Branagh) is trying to get his hands on this technology and many people will believe that it will start a World War III. The hero gets his help from many people including Neil (Robert Pattinson), Mahir (Himesh Patel), Kat (Elizabeth Debicki), and many more people along the way.Tenet has been a film many people couldn't wait to experience for themselves. It is the newest film from Christopher Nolan. He has made so many marvelous master pieces in the past years such as Inception, The Dark Knight, and Memento. This film was triggering the same level of excitement as those for many people. Although I thought the film wasn't as well put together as those masterpieces. One thing many people keep dumping on this film is how confusing it is. It is a very complexed film. You need to watch this picture many times to fully understand what every line of dialogue means and what everybody is doing throughout the whole film. Although I don't think many people remember that you had to see Inception, Memento and even The Prestige multiple times to fully grasp the meaning of the movie. So I don't think that is a problem with this movie. The problem I found was the characterization. There isn't much of it throughout this picture. Neil (Robert Pattinson) doesn't get his backstory till the end of the picture which leaves you for the whole movie wondering what is he doing here? You don't even know what Michael Caine does in this film. Otherwise Kat (Elizabeth Debicki) and Saton (Kenneth Branagh) have a very well set up chemistry and is executed really well. Although the protagonist isn't really set up too well either until the end. Which is pretty annoying as well because he is the character that you follow. Many people have been wining about the fact that the main character doesn't have a name but that doesn't really matter to me. Clint Eastwood never had a name in the dollars trilogy and that never ticked people off.The action is probably a main thing many people come to this movie to see. As you might know this film doesn't use any green screen which is now hailed by many movie fans because of the overuse in movies such as Jumanji Welcome's To The Jungle and The Avengers movies. It is pretty cool to see a movie that does a lot of stuff practical. And I must say it is really impressive to see how they did those stunts in the behind the scenes clips you can find on the internet. The hand to hand combat is also really riveting. It is intense and gives you a blast of excitement. From this well placed action, you feel like this film never puts the breaks on ever. There was never a time in the movie I looked down at my phone to see what time it was. This film was very well paced from the action and intriguing story (although it is confusing upon first watch).The score is a main thing many Nolan fans were worried about coming into this film. As you might know Hans Zimmer was busy with another project during the time this one was getting made so Nolan brought on the young composer Ludwig Goransson. He was composed many other films and TV shows like The Mandalorian, Black Panther, and the Creed films. I have enjoyed the score for all of those projects so I was really excited to see what Ludwig Goransson would do for this film. Walking out the theater, I found it sounding the same as any other Nolan movie. It was still a great score, don't get me wrong but it was vastly similar to the score in Nolan's previous works. I don't know if Goransson thought it would make most sense for the score to sound like Hans Zimmer or if it was Nolan stepping in saying this is how I would like it to sound. It still sounded really well crafted though.Tenet is a very ambitious film that just barely misses the mark for what I wanted it to be. It had some really well put together action that has been lacking in recent films of the last couple years but failed to give an investing backstory for the leading characters which caused me the viewer, to not feel enthralled to follow them on this journey."
1971,"Christopher Nolan has quite often examined the theme and idea of time in his movies. How it works, how it could be meddled with, how it could be made to work for interesting narrative. Tenet, his latest, just might be his magnum opus in that regard. It's a story about an unnamed protagonist, who gets tangled into something far larger than anything he has dealt before. Objects have been tampered with in the future and now they're travelling backwards through time, which threatens to unmake the very fabric of reality.A simple enough concept on paper. Well, simple-ish. And while the plot of Tenet isn't the hardest to understand, Nolan does his best to create as much spectacle out of it as he can. The man has always been a masterful visual storyteller. Things happen on screen in this movie that will blow your mind. Entire action set pieces are built upon the idea that different pieces and people within them are moving in two different directions chronologically.And that makes for some really compelling cinema. Visually this is a superb film. Astonishing, grandiose, even awe-inspiring. Structurally it could be better. My friends and I exited the theatre with proverbial smoke pouring out of our ears, asking the simple question of what just happened. To Nolan's credit, he does tie of the strings well enough. The film does make sense if you think about it long enough. But it's far from elegantly told.I also wasn't sold on the characters. Nolan's films are always more driven by concepts and ideas than characters, but usually I still end up caring about them more than I did here. This is not to say the characters in this film were bad, but they also weren't that great either. Although the actors were giving it their all.I think that Nolan bit off more than he could chew with this film. Albeit only just. Tenet is a complex idea wrapped in visual spectacle and some of the finest cinematography seen in years. But it's not a movie I see myself returning to year after year."
1972,"Im going to give Nolan a pass since he's one of the few filmakers trying to do original content instead of reboots or franchises., but this one is a very confusing movie.If you need to wait for the infographic to appear in reddit to understand, then you know the plot didn't work completely.And this is a Plot driven movie as you expect from Nolan. In that regard is not his best moment.I like Robert Pattinson in the supporting role, he turned out to be a very charismatic actor.Elizabeth Debicki is a beauty to behold.The ""protagonist"" doesn't have a motivation, is sort of a plot device, could have used some script treatment.John David Washington has no charisma. Bad choice. Idris Elba could have done a better job.I watched it with subtitles so I cannot complain about the sound.Travel in time concept is entertaining.Great special and practical special effects as expected.Worth wachting it one time. It's not that deep as you might think. Purposely confusing is not deep."
1973,"I gave this movie one star which is a bit harsh. But when you have to obtain a doctors degree in physics to keep up, something is dead wrong. Sure, there are some great action sequences in it and to Nolans big credit there are few or if any green screens or cgi.
So thats cool. But the story and the time line?! Jeee suuuuzzzz. There is a lot of talk now about corona and cinema, and this movie was suppose to bring people back to theaters and because it didn't there is no use of trying. That annoys me! Tenet is just to damn complicated for a broad audience to comprehend. Nolan is a great movie maker no doubt. But once he doesn't have to prove how smart he is and actually makes a story one can keep up with, and doesn't run backwards two thirds of the movie, I'm certain people will return to movie theaters again."
1974,"The action scenes are wildly exciting, but for such a complicated plot, Nolan does a simply brilliant job of keeping us emotionally invested in the deep characters, emotions, and crisis presented in Tenet.Be sure to pay very careful attention in the seemingly unimportant filler scenes, as this is where many of the emotional power and survival if the species depth is built and explained.Can't wait to see it again. The dialogue, character arcs, plot, and brilliantly imaginative sci-fi combine to make this one of the most novel, interesting, and exciting films we've seen in years.Enjoy"
1975,"I love the idea of a person or an object moving backwards through time, both from their perspective and a 'non-inverted' one. It just about seems possible but is confusing enough to still baffle you. I feel like it was slightly under utilised in creating cool storylines, it's not that clever that HE was the one running the show all along I think. That being said I loved the way he was able to fight himself and Robert Pattison at the same time, inverted and not. The last battle is a bit of a wash too, you never see anyone they're fighting and the temporal pincer movement tactic doesn't isn't obviously advantageous, but seeing half your army limping off as soon as you arrive was a clever foreshadowing.The soundtrack banged and seemed like it was never turned off so your heart rate doesn't get a chance to drop below 100bpm. Also, Patterson should be the next bond, he's now middle aged good looking enough to pull it off."
1976,"The concept of going forward and backwards was really interesting and I throughly enjoyed how they made it happen on screen. The plane crash, to me, was very underwhelming from when I originally heard that Nolan wanted to crash (another) a plane. But then it went backwards and I was amazed for what I just saw. The whole fight scene from the Protagonist the first time was really cool but the second time in reverse was even better considering that he knew the moves he used the first time and was countering everything. 10/10 cinematography.
The plot, on the other hand, was kinda boring but I guess it could have something to do with me not being able to hear what the characters were saying a lot of the time; I think Christopher Nolan may be going deaf.
The score by Ludwig Goransonn was off the charts. That opening scene in the opera was so intense and the score really set the mood and tempo for what was about to take place.
If there's one thing that you can expect in cinema, it's that Nolan will always give you a kick ass intro.
Overall, the movie was more on of the side on interesting and visually stunning than good. I would 100% watch it again with subtitles."
1977,"Huge fan of Christopher Nolan, love his previous work. Interstellar is most probably my favorite movie. This movie left me confused and unable to follow, and that is a problem. The sound was horrendous, I was in a movie theater with one other person and there were times where I could not follow the dialogue because it was so muffled. The end was reminiscent of the Dark Knight Rises in so many ways, it was a rehash and disappointing. I think it could be better with multiple screenings, but that again is a problem."
1978,"I have been a huge Nolan fan and his complicated plots like Inception and interstellar are close to my heart.But Tenet is overly complicated which wasn't a pleasing experience at the theater.Most of the time you are too confused to enjoy the movie.Acting 10/10
Cinematography 9/10
Plot/Story 6/10
Dialogue Delivery 5/10 (Subtitles are mandatory to understand the dialogues between characters)"
1979,"Impressed with first viewing although I could not fully hear all the dialogue. Eager to watch again and with subtitles once released for bluray. Love the concept, and trying to fit complex ideas of inversion of entropy and time into a cinematic experience. I will admit this may not be everyone's cup of tea, but if you enjoy challenging and fresh concepts, this movie will not disappoint. Will update my rating positively or negatively after subsequent viewings. But as of now, this is my fifth favorite Nolan film. Dark knight, Memento, Interstellar, and Inception are better, but that may change after more viewings."
1980,"This is definitely his most complicated and confusing plot thus far.
The first hour was spent trying to catch up with what was going on on the screen.
However, once the concept of ""inversion"" started to become more clear, the movie became more enjoyable than it already was.Seeing this film in IMAX was an incredible experience.
The combination of the soundtrack, volume, and cinematography on screen had me on the edge of my seat. (The volume was almost TOO loud, but it made it very immersive)
My only gripe with the film which seems to be pretty common is the dialogue audio is sometimes hard to hear; the soundtrack seems to be prioritized over the dialogue during scenes when characters are having conversations, and that can make things even more difficult during an already confusing, hard to follow movie.Debicki and Pattinson were particularly fantastic in this film.Don't expect to fully grasp the concept or the story completely by the end of your first viewing. In the words of one of the film's characters: ""Don't try to understand it. Feel it.""Must see if you've enjoyed Nolan's previous work.
See it in IMAX if possible, or at the very least, in theater."
1981,"This is a very complex movie. I will have to watch it several more time to give an honest review. I am a film fan, but after the first watch I think I had more questions than wheni watched the trailer. The film ""feels"" epic in the Crhistoper Nolan style, but the storyline is so complex that I may need to start drawing diagrams and use the pause button to truly appreciate this film. I will definitely watch it again, but my first take was that this was that this was the equivalent of a Jackson Pollock painting in film."
1982,"I could say it is a fantastic movie.But compared with other Nolan's movie, it seems a little boring. The whole movie is just a story, almost no love, no friendship. Umm anyway , I still love it. Love the way it looked, the way the actors and actresses acted and the way Nolan directed.Imp, TENET must be the best movie of 2020."
1983,"In fact, it's not difficult to understand. I think of Liu Cixin's short story. It also conceives the backwardness of the physical theorem of time-space consistency. The concept is greater than the story. As for the movie ""tenet ,"" the physical law crushes the world, and the plot is greater Everything, everyone is so hurried and so small, without life and character, as well a beginning as well a change, the starting point and the ending point are mutually cause and effect, bringing grand experience to the audience, fascinating people to think about the present and the future, but this The creation is accompanied by the sinking of the ceiling of the actors in Nolan's movies. The only thing that reflects the characteristics of the actor is Debicki's long legs: the rear seat is locked, and the others have little room for display from beginning to end. The runners walk and talk. , Sitting and threatened by others...The grand scene and the compact narrative but the details are not rigorous, there are several bugs"
1984,",,Put (inception + memento + interstellar and even maybe Batman 2008"" the rope scene"") all in a blender and you have the movie Tenet, that is it,,so literally he does again,, no creativity nothing new, i would gave it less than 6/10 but i think because i watch it on iMax so that increases the rate🙏."
1985,"As a Nolan Aficionado, I was truly pumped up for this film. The fact that I never watch any trailers to keep myself in mystery and this being the first film I was able to see with my friends after a long time took my expectations and my excitement to the Zenith !As a plot heavy film with beautiful visuals, action sequences and top notch acting from the cast (didn't expect so many actors from order of phoenix to be in this film) the film doesn't disappoint what Nolan fans have come to expect. But there are a lot of glaring issues that needs introspection.1) First, many of friends and myself included felt the sound effects and background score subdued voice and it was considerably harder to discern.2) Scene transitions were less fluidic. The protagonist jumps from one location to another in a fleeting instance. (no, this is not related to plot or time inversion)3) Expository scenes intended to explain audiences of critical points felt very rushed.4) I felt Nolan chose to cop-out whenever there was something abstract/difficult to explain, similar to ""they"" in interstellarConclusion - You will scratch your heads ! You will keep guessing till the end ! Many will have a polarised reception ! But you will have fun.As always, please take all necessary precautions while enjoying the movie with families and friends !"
1986,"Nolan has always been one of my favorite directors. However, everything was pretty good except for the scenario...Why would someone think such a complicated scenario that viewers could not understand what they were watching and at some points gaps were created because of that.."
1987,"I spent the first hour or so of the movie trying to figure out what the hell was going on, and then about midway through the movie theres a string of ""aha"" moments where everything begins to come full shape. Then vintage Nolan kicks in with a hour and a half of the best filmmaking you will ever see.
Acting,cinematography, sound, set design, and mise en scene were all A level, but the writing could have been touched up a little for better understanding.
The time travel thats utilized in this movie is still something im trying to understand however, so i will definitely be going a second time.
Would also recommend seeing in dolby as i had to see this in normal AMC and could tell i was missing out on what was already a incredible soundtrack with average speakers."
1988,"I'm quite disappointed that being an avid Nolan fan I couldn't make myself to give this a 10. However I look (or how much ever), the movie lacked a little to attain perfection. It lacks emotional connect. The factor that distinguishes great from good cinema. Tenet is great but won't be in any abstract list for best of all time.As for what works in it: everything else. Fast and tight script, beautiful cinematography, pulsating music, a big idea, cinematic thrills, novel presentation and good performances. All check. At times, it felt like the idea is too big for a 150 minute movie as major details are implications rather than scenes in screenplay (i do understand a major movie can't afford much). World here rather befits a mini series that explores and exploits the ideas raised here (Mr. Nolan, if you can hear me...). It's a non-stop heart pounding (brain pounding more like) ride jumping from a location to location, not letting you the agency of time to breathe. I just wished it had more emotional involvement with its cognitive high standard bench mark to fully hammer it home. Inception and Dark knight are greatest examples of this.It clearly seems like Mr. Nolan aimed for a cinematic experience like never before as opposed to a complete cinematic experience. In raising a bar high, he left another bar untouched which of adjusted a little would have made this is his possible best. It still is a bold move with original idea in a world of sequels and adaptations on rut. Actors are all aces and Nolan's direction is finer than ever (on par with his Dunkirk effort).I always admired screenwriter Nolan over director Nolan. His writing is ever surprising and most holistic. Guess, if his direction shines in this, as per universal rule, maybe we can't have all we want from screenplay then. For delivering higher levels of energy, it missed out on synergy."
1989,Were action and sci exist kept me on the edge and asking questions worth a re-watch
1990,"What you know from the trailer is basically the whole thing. Timey wimey wibbly wobbly. Great big set action pieces, a barely explained convoluted plot, and lots of planet hopping cannot overcome the one thing you knew was coming, and that is that at the end you will need to re-watch this movie for it to make any sense at all. It was all leading to that point and to sit through 2.5hrs to get to that pint was tiresome. Acting, cinematography, action, all great, but Nolan needs to get over his incessant need to seem clever."
1991,"Tenet is far from Nolan's best work but still hooks you up till the end, while you're fighting with your mind trying to catch up with the plot.If you have seen recent movies of Christopher Nolan, you know he has a thing now to have non-linear storytelling, and in Tenet he does the same thing except instead of just storytelling, there are many things which move back-and-forth in time. Without spoiling anything, this movie is a little hard to understand at first, and a great score over dialogues doesn't help the viewer either to understand what's going on.However, unlike Inception what's going on the screen, is not very entertaining other than some brilliant action pieces and breath-taking visuals. But that shouldn't surprise considering the budget of the movie is around $200 million. But amid all this sci-fi and action, viewers can have a hard time understanding what's the goal of ""The Protagonist"", and what they're really trying to achieve, which keeps viewers away from the heart of the story.Saying that this movie will be much better on a second viewing when you know the story, and can appreciate hidden character motivation and not trying to figure things out. Overall, Tenet is very impressive and will be a cult hit in the future requiring multiple watches, but it's not as entertaining as Inception or Dunkirk, at least not at the first viewing."
1992,"Great movie, Christopher Nolan really knows how to blow your mind with a great story and throwing in science you won't understand but you don't mind.Some of the scenes are amazing and you just wonder how they've put it together.A movie well worth a trip to the cinema for."
1993,"I'm a Christopher Nolan fan, however I found this movie too confusing to watch in the cinema. To echo many other reviews, the sound quality was poor (dialogue was quiet/muffled whereas action scenes were unbearably loud), adding to overall frustrations.It's worth waiting for home release to as there'll be a lot of pausing, rewinding and subtitling needed to truly understand and appreciate what I'm sure is a good movie (once understood!)."
1994,"I loved this film! It did not disappoint. Yes, it required concentration, however, that was what I enjoyed most. I was on the edge of my seat from start to finish. I will definitely watch again to pick up on the little things that I may not have captured the first time round. John Washington was great in his role as the protagonist and I enjoyed Robert Pattinson performance."
1995,"Tenet is an original action packed sci-fi thriller directed by worldclass director Cristopher Nolan, with its own and unique perception on time and space.The first act of the movie had a minor pacing issue in my opinion.You get thrown into this mix of action scene's, newly discovered materials and different locations within the first 30 minutes of the story. It felt a bit to much for me. Second act is where Tenet really starts to unfold, the different characters and their (understandable) motivations get set up and the 'antagonist' is introduced.Third act ties up all the loose ends and some major clues all the way back to the first act get explained. Therefore, the whole story feels complete and connected. the whole third act is basiclly one huge batlle against the clock to try and stop the antagonist.What i really liked about Tenet is the fact that most of the stunts and car chases are performed IRL, without the use of CGI. Altough the story of Tenet is packed with action, it delivered some great humour to break up the tension sometimes. The fighting choreography was on point, with the hallway scene in particular. Last of all I appreciate the fact that Nolan chose for a lead actor that only did six other films.For me, Tenet missed the 'spark' that I was expecting from a Christopher Nolan film like Inception and The Dark Knight to see this as a masterpiece of a movie."
1996,"This may well be the most unique film of the 21st century so far. It pushes so many boundaries - the plot, the cinematography, the stunts, the action.Whether you like Nolan movies, Tenet is a must watch, since it's something you have never seen before. Almost inaccessible at first, the film assembles itself like a puzzle in front of your eyes during successive viewings.Chris Nolan has always challenged himself in the making of his films and with Tenet he also challenges his audience. The first time I saw the movie I was extremely confused, though very impressed. The second time I could follow the plot, see new details and understand subtle cues hinting at what's to come. In a way you start seeing thing like a time-traveller.Tenet is a marvel. Storytelling-wise and technically. Although not flawless, this movie is so special and so different that I can not give it anything but a 10."
1997,"Usually it's always about what a movie has to offer instead of what it lacks. To shorten up: Tenet has no unnessecary dialogues or long scenes that want to add a dramatic touch, not much of those short sentences that are repeated in almost every action thriller from characters to show off cool, no excessively overdone CGI or introduction of every character, no deep love story that takes over the whole movie or characters that act just pure out of emotions, even their emotional intentions seem well planned.
Because Nolans script misses all those 'typical' things and adds up all the intelligent content, screenplay, speeches, plot etc. it's a really well-minded and thoughtful movie. The story just continues without hesitation, Tenet never stops to focus. The editing is so fluent, and even though you might get confused sometimes or need to catch up with it, it's really enjoyable.
There's so much room for interpretation in almost every spoken sentence. And a whole different way to play with the interpretation of time."
1998,How do I summarize the movie in just one word? I would say that INCREDIBLE fits pretty well. I will admit that it was quite hard to follow at times but once you have wrapped your head around the concept you will be taken on one of the most exciting and mind bending rides of your life... TENET is a masterpiece!
1999,There are just so many things I couldn't follow or understand. Things will probably get clearer on a second watch.
2000,Great movie by Michael Bay enthusiast Chris Nolan. It's like a cross between Bad Boys and Transformers. Served up on a platter of pearl harbour.
2001,"I am still a bit sceptical about this film. Well first of all its a great effort for all the creative minds involved with it. Its stunning to look at, excellently written and very well directed. The acting is very good and it is absolutely memorable. But one thing bothers me is that the film tries to be too clever for its own good and I think its prime reason to exist is to confuse. Now, movie puzzles like this are my speciality and I love them, and even after solving this I can't share the same enthusiasm about it as many others. I figured it out ( well I think) but its conclusion and ""cleverness"" doesnt really excite me on the same level. And this comes from a major Christopher Nolan fan. Maybe multiple viewings help - at least thats what I keep reading. Nolan invented his own physics here and I adore the creativity about it. So yes, I do like this movie but did not love it as much as I expected or as many others do.
The acting is great. John David Washington really makes sure Denzel's talent will live on in the future generations. He really nailed the role and played it like an absolute pro. Kudos for this casting clue. I also liked Robert Pattinson. I really like him more and more and I am so happy his crappy ""Twilight"" days are gone. He nailed Neil from the bones... and added a lot to the character. Elizabeth Debicki was also good and had many great moments. I really liked Kenneth Branagh although he overdid it from time to time but he was menacing and unpredictable in this role which I loved. One of his better performances in the recent years. Michael Caine had a glorified cameo which is always enjoyable in a Nolan film and already a nice trademark. The score was fantastic, although often felt Ludwig Göransson tried to copy Hans Zimmer. Brilliant cinematography and action scenes. The only thing that bothered me a bit was the weird Scene-to-scene editing. It often takes you out in the middle of the action and puts you into a totally new scenery. Oh well not Nolan's greatest diretctional effort but a must see of the year for sure."
2002,"Finally, a new movie out in theatres, and a good one at that. Christopher Nolan returns with his latest mind-bending spectacle led by another fantastic cast. As might be expected in Nolan films, this was a visual feast for the eyes. The uniquely crafted action sequences mixed with the amazing score by Ludwig Göransson make for some of the best moments in the movie. However, this might be Nolan's most confusing movie. (This makes Inception look like it's for children.) Not only that, but the sound mixing was audaciously bombastic. In other words, the dialogue was a muffled whisper whereas the music/sound effects were a roaring thunder of a jet plane. It made it impossible to hear everything and follow along making me wish I watched it with subtitles. There's no doubt about it, to fully appreciate this piece of cinema, it demands multiple viewings. In fact, a second viewing would probably improve my score for it. (I just don't want to abuse my hearing again.) But as it stands now, this was a good movie with moments of greatness.Score: 7 out of 10
Overall: GoodRecommended for: Fans of Christopher Nolan, fans of mind-bending, time-based narratives, or fans of destroying their hearing."
2003,"I highly advice it to watch it twice because your first watch alone may leaves you kinda disappointed. This movie is a lot like Mementos which requires multiple re-watch to assemble all the puzzle pieces together.First off, this movie isn't meant to be an 'acting' magnum opus. The actors all do a fine job, but it's obvious this movie wasn't needing method actors like Christian Bales, Joaquin Phoenix, Matthew McConaughey, etc. The brilliance of the movie resides in the concept itself. It's hard to review the movie without ruining it with spoilers, so I'll leave it at that. Just remember that it needs more than one watch. I give it 9/10 because at the end you need to pay twice for the movie...I'm a huge fan of time-travel stories, especially the ones involving time paradox concepts. One that come to mind is a smart time-travel novella I've read around March titled Project Dechentreiter (2015) by Elder Prince. I couldn't understand the story from one-time reading, my mind was in torment even though there were so many clues and puzzle pieces hidden in plain sight. Everything made so much sense after a second read (luckily the story only counts 80 pages), and what a fantastic e-book that I highly recommend. There was also a movie called Time Lapse (2014), that one included brilliant ideas but wasn't executed with elegance, but is a good watch anyway.I can't wait for Christopher Nolan's next movie!"
2004,"POSITIVES:1) Kenneth Branagh is fantastic as the villain
2) The score and the sound effects are both incredible
3) The action scenes are out of this world!! The opening action scene in the opera house gets you locked into the film instantaneously; an unbelievable opening sequence
4) I respect Nolan for always being inventive and newNEGATIVES:1) Elizabeth Debicki's character is just a damsel in distress over and over again and I honestly was rooting for her to get killed at multiple points in the film
2) I don't think any amount of repeat viewings will change the amount of nonsense that the plot has
3) The editing and cutting between scenes was often very jarring and quite poorly done in my opinion
4) It seemed like Nolan had so much he wanted to include and so in order to fit it into 2.5 hours he had all the cast say their lines soooo fast. The Michael Caine scene in particular just sounded like he was rushing every single line"
2005,"Seriously I couldn't unstand what people were saying, intelibity was 2\5 no joke, don't go to imax see another version. Film looked great, and good concept just spoilt by the soundtrack."
2006,"Clever premise, well executed, thrilling and a bit meta. The only problem with Tenet is that even the characters struggle at times to know where this is going. Also, the film could have been reduced to 2 hours as it is heavily reliant on dialogue and can get tedious at times. Otherwise, great film to watch during COVID times. I wouldn't be surprised if this film becomes a game changer. However, an Oscar nomination for Best Picture seems unlikely.FJ Medina
Rate: 7.5/10"
2007,This film is good and masterpiece but too complicated to watch in theatre. Especially the scenes with 2 time flows counterpart. These scenes look cool though. However they are not easily understandable.
2008,Not good but can watchable. Can not be understand little bit. Action are good.
2009,"Ok so the good.This movie has some great action scenes. It has some great scenes. It has a good sound track. Everyone plays a great part throughout this movie, and scripts are on point with the characters on display. Everything feels very well directed in the broad scale of elements.The Ok...This film is long, and a lot of scenes have been cut down or just removed to fit the edit. This is evident when in certain scenes you feel are flying by actually have 15/30 minutes in between when they're rellocated from the middle of a busy highway, to a dock warehouse in the next scene with the same characters. This is skimmed over badly to the point where one second they're in London, the next in a dessert. Given how crammed this movie is, its not a big deal, but makes the movie even harder to understand. The special FX or explosions in this case are a little over the top. Everything explodes with LOADS of FIRE, which makes it seem a bit cheap. Car's zipping along at highway speeds in reverse didn't make much sense. Some of the action scenes got very samey and a little tiring towards the end of the film, as it just gets reused the effects they keep using. Some of the characters are kinda weak, but are they minor or major? You don't know if you don't pay careful attention. You barely know there names either.The Bad...Well, if you miss a conversation in this film, you have to repeat it, or you won't understand the film. If anyone tells you they understood this film the first time, congratulations, you've found a liar. This film is incredibly confusing and between us 3 adult men aged between 35 - 53, none of us got it. You barely know characters names as they don't repeat them being introduced to X, Y and Z in the future. The volume of the music compared the dialogue is just a joke. It just feels like in every action scene when the music gets all intense, you can't even hear what the characters are saying. This happens, OVER AND OVER again. It's only about 3/4 of the way through the film we learn what the entire point of the film is all about, as everything until then has just been background filler. The last 1/4 of the film felt so squeezed in, it has some horrible cliche's a film of this calibre just should have had.To note, I really hated Inception, but I found this movie a little easier to like. Still had much the same nagging points though, like an overly complex story for a very simple premise of a movie. This is revealed much to late through the movie, where half the movie has past and just isn't really relevant after. The music, was just too loud against the volume of the characters. You're left with more questions than answers after the movie, and much of it is never even touched on, or at least I missed the conversation they had explaining it, because a pin dropped in the room, and I couldn't hear it over the deafening music playing throughout the movie. The cliche's at the end of the movie, yeeah I thought that was a weak twist to such a movie."
2010,"At first watch I was confused a bit as the movie was too fast and noisy. Watched it again. Turns out, Nolan has done it again! It's a brilliant masterpiece! The sound effects need to be adjusted so that everyone could grasp the story and the brilliant concept."
2011,"I really enjoyed the movie. But I will say it was almost 100% spectacle/plot driven. Fortunately for me I loved the spectacle and plot the movie had to offer, so it didn't bother me much. However all the people out there who didn't enjoy because it was void of true character and an emotional theme...it's hard to argue with them.I still enjoyed it A LOT. But when you compare it to Nolan's Inception, which has killer spectacle, plot AND character...there's no contest."
2012,"I absolutely love Nolan's work, usually, this one, however... Not so much. I couldn't follow 80% of the movie, and not for the reasons you might think. Every dialog in the movie is annoyingly mumbled, and this is not to help a ""plot"" that's supposed to be complex. There's some clever editing that tries to make you ""feel"" that the consequences precedes the causes, like when the protagonist shots a ""reverse"" gun for the first time he has almost no reaction, but when he tries the second time, he's surprised. Unfortunately, it feels more like bad acting than a clever move, I like the idea, but the execution should have been thought over more deeply. The concept is real good though, but it felt way to hard to be translated on screen, what a shame. Maybe a re-editing could make it better, but who knows at this point."
2013,"Tenet is Nolan's visually most breathtaking film, but it lacks heart and emotion. Think of it as a bombshell you'd like to be seen around with, but not as someone with whom you'd want to spend your midnights talking.Nolan is one of the few directors who can bring everybody to watch his films and create a cinematic momentum in the film world. And he is doing that consistently, ever since he made The Dark Night, the movie that elevated him to the stratosphere where he takes residence to this day. Now, although his films are some of the biggest money-makers in the business, I consider Nolan to be a slightly above average filmmaker.I used to love Nolan's films, but as I've been rewatching some of his movies lately, now I think that they are some of the most boring films ever. The concept and the story are exciting, but all the freaking dialogue ruins everything. Gallons and gallons of exposition that feel forced in the mouth of the characters is not good writing. Nolan's characters feel very cartoonistic. If you check, except for Heath Ledger, none of the actors portraying Nolan's characters hasn't been nominated for an Oscar. Nolan has worked with some of the best actors in Hollywood, but he has failed in pushing them to give their best.His writing is always on behalf of the plot. He is a cerebral, plot-driven filmmaker, and the concepts he comes up with for his movies are mind-consuming, but something lacks in his films. To present his invigorating and complicated ideas, he has to sacrifice his characters. His characters are just pawns he uses to explain and further the plot. They don't feel real. They feel robotic, out of touch with the way people act in their everyday life. There are so many cringe lines in his writing that sometimes come out of nowhere. I can't forget this vomit-worthy moment in the movie Interstellar. I'm talking about the ""love transcends dimensions"" scene. That is more painful to me than the slow-motion moments in the Indian telenovelas. But it seems that the average audience has no problem with Nolan's lovey-dovey touch on the dialogue.Tenet is nothing new in terms of how Nolan approached the storytelling/plot-structure. Here Nolan decides to keep us in the dark for a bit more than usual, and I think that's what drags this film down. If we would have known more about the characters and about what this story is about from the very beginning, we'd have felt for the characters more. We get to know everything only later on in the film, when Nolan explains in luxurious details, as always. Nolan doesn't believe much in his audience. It's like he creates these very complex stories about scientific stuff, and then he sits down and thinks: ""Oh wait, I'm not making this movie only for the people who have a Ph.D. in physics."" And then, in his attempt to make his movies accessible for broader audiences, he ruins them a bit.What I liked here were the mesmerizing color palettes. I think that the color palettes in most of Nolan's films (Dunkirk excluded) are a bit messy, not very well thought-out, but here they are very alluring. I liked the whole look of the film and the vibe of the images. Also, the score is almost as good as in any other Nolan film. Ludwig Göransson was very important in giving Nolan a better grip on the overall theme of the film. The score is gripping, suspenseful, and exciting. Yet another exceptional piece for Göransson to add to his body of work.I am very disappointed. I was hoping for Nolan to keep up at least close to the level of Dunkirk, but nope, he goes old Nolan here again. He went back at the Nolan that strikes for grand audiences by being politically correct and sentimental in the cheesiest way. Yes, those are the two most important details for a blockbuster movie, Nolan style."
2014,"This movie is really difficult to understand partly due to the plot and the dialogue that often doesn't make any sense. Nolan's movies are often complicated in a good way, but this one is complicated for the sake of being complicated.
I am starting to get a feeling that the director doesn't want people to know that he isn't smart as he would like people to believe.
This movie has some very unnecessary secondary characters and subplot, reminds me of high school students padding their essays just to fill the required word quotas.
I think some of the action scenes were really lame, who thought backwards moving cars made good action sequences? What a gimmick."
2015,"Well, just watched the movie and I gave 6 stars due to the already renowned technical achieveness Nolan is well-known, and Tenet has it all around. But as mentioned on several other reviews here, the movie is very confusing. By the way, throughout the movie I felt so dumb due to the fact that I simply couldn't understand half of what was going on. Luckly, I was not alone at that thought.
There are some predictable moments which I won't mention here because of its spoiling nature, but, com'on, the airport fight sequence? That was waaaay too obvious! That ""we're not alone here"" line just said everything (oops, I said I would not mention any spoiler, maybe that's just me doing a reversed review).
Anyway, as I'm from Brazil, though I speak english quite decently, I was well-aware of the complex storyline, so I paid total attention to the subs, and that's why I couldn't realize how sound design was loud and filled of mumbled lines (what makes me think it's kinda a Nolan's trademark, having characters you barely understand, just like Bane from third Batman movie). That loud sound throughout the movie and low speeching is a common issue on severeal reviews from english speaking audience, so I thik it was even harder for them to understand what was going on screen than it was to me.
Back on the movie, it is not bad... but with such a hard-to-get story and long screen time, I don't feel inclined to watch it again any sooner, let alone pay the outrageous ticket price just to understand it.
I loved (and still) several Nolan's movies... Memento, The Prestige, Interstellar, Inception... they all have plot twists, or a final resolution or no resolution at all... but they're gems, you watch them and will watch again because they all make sense in the end. As for Tenet, I don't believe I will ever understand it. The final sequence almost made my brain squirmish in a selfdevouring blackhole.
Perhaps that's exactly Nolan's point here... make a movie no one can understand... not even him, I guess."
2016,"The movie began with some action sequences, which I really enjoyed and thought to myself that this is going to be a typical action movie where the protagonist tracks the evil character and tries to stop him, like in the James Bond movies, but as you delve into the movie you begin to realize that within this whole plot is the good old idea of time machine, but not typical time machine as we think of it. The concept of time travel in Tenet is that when you go back in time the whole world around you keeps moving on, but you keep going back in time. It is similar to Benjamin Button reversed aging process, going from elderhood to youthfulness. To be honest, a first time viewer of this movie will be confused to the events taking place, but I recommend if you are going to give this movie a shot, at least do a brief research on reversing entropy in objects."
2017,"I will watch this film again, that is a definite. Not because I need to fully understand what I have just seen. Not because I believe a word about some of the other reviews about Tenet being a masterpiece-so many secrets-blah. Simply because this is one of the best action films I have seen so far. Score, editing, cinematography, Washington, Pattinson, the kitchen fight. Absolutely awesome and thrilling in every scene and aspect.
The plot and story will leave you feeling puzzled but why not? I would love to be able to make absolute sense about the plot and if it really needs 10 more screenings I am up for it.
I love Nolan's work; but I am also able to look beyond the hype. Just remember Inception. All these layers and levels within the story, for what? To get some industry espionage on the way? So, why does Tenet have to be much, much more than what we see?
Don't get fooled. It is a great film, and if it makes you think and wonder, just enjoy it even more. Remember the hundreds of films you watch and forget. This won't be one of them."
2018,"I liked the sounds and the effects, and the actors are great, but the plot didn't amaze me or catch. I was very bored in the end. I loved Inception but it can be hard to achieve always great results focusing every time on time travel/space and physics kind of topics. Sorry, I didn't like it."
2019,"The film is a very full on attack, complete with beautiful visuals, gorgeous sound design and charming individual performances. This very full on film may please many die-hard Nolan fans, but not me. If a film takes two viewings to fully comprehend, then it hasn't done its job. The film feels like too much of a passion project, something that Nolan would've understood, directing a crew that was as confused as myself. In simple terms, a good film with modern issues."
2020,"I should've known! It's 2020, why would it have been any good?I should've known I wouldn't have a clue what the hell was going on and that I'd be frustrated, angry and disappointed.Had we not paid £50 quid to see it I would've walked out of the cinema.I've never been so pissed off coming out of a movie. I've also never felt so dumb watching one. The plot made no sense, fair enough we're not meant to know a lot to begin with but there was never any time given to the audience to catch up with everything that was going on.It was also so hard to hear their mumbling lines over the music. And the music was so good in so many parts but so overwhelming in others and not in a pleasant way.I also don't get what went wrong on the last scene with Pattinson but he didn't even sound British!!!!Also why is Hollywood obsessed with Kenneth Branagh. His accents are about as convincing as Trumps tan. FML.The cinematography was beautiful as was Washington's performance but don't pay to watch it.It's added to the trash heap that is 2020."
2021,"A unique movie that could have been so much better... But instead was just barely a 61) I like the actor John David Washington but just not in this role. This movie could have been so much better with someone else as the lead2) Same for Robert Pattinson. Really like him in general but just not in this role. Someone else would have been better3) Really too much overkill on the reverse special effects. Fascinating at first and obviously needed to be shown quite a bit given the movie's plot but nevertheless I think they were used way too much in the movie and after a while became annoying4) I had 2 free passes from Studio Movie Grill and used them to see this movie. If I had paid $20+ a ticket to see it I would have felt pretty pissed at the end because this movie was built up as a 9 to 10 blockbuster and it is just barely above averageI would give it a 9 or so for uniqueness and creativity
Of the idea/premise of the movie but the actual movie itself is 5.5 to 6 because it was mis-cast and not carried off very well and could have been so much better.
This would have been better as a Netflix movie - not something worthy of $20+ tickets"
2022,"I think this quote says a lot, ""So in a sense, the Sator square is seeded throughout Tenet, woven into its fabric in a way that is easy to miss. Yet it's unmistakably present, and since the movie itself contains sequences that move, in essence, forward and backward - and are the same yet different when you watch them - it functions, in a way, like a kind of cinematic Sator square."""
2023,"About one hour into the film, I was asking myself ""What the hell is going on?"". Don't worry. Similar to ""The Prestige"" and ""Dunkirk"" and as I like to say in ""classic Nolan fashion"", the movie starts to piece together important nuances and as you start to understand more and more about what's going on and where the the film is headed, Tenet quickly becomes a masterpiece. This is hands down a movie where you will want to watch a second, third, even fourth time and continuously catch new aspects you never noticed or realized before. Also, the movie's visuals are stunning.Absolutely recommend seeing Tenet."
2024,"As a diehard Christopher Nolan fan, I admit, I have a built-in expectations/bias for each of his films. Often high expectations. How can you blame me? From the DK trilogy to Inception to Interstellar they each had a fantastic story and firm characters. Mixed with Hitchcock tension and ocean philosophy, Nolan brings so much to the table. Too much, I fear, to balance properly.As I walked out of the showing, I felt bummed out. Halfway through I was confused as hell. I wondered if my expectations were ungodly high or that the film was truly that bad. 'Tenet' was nothing more than a soulless, teethless blight that tried desperately to make its story look intelligent. The failure was in the basis: the pacing was pressed and rushed; the story was empty and unfinished; and the characters were stale and just plain boring. Washington's character(The Protagonist) had no depth, nothing for the audience to care for, he was just a shell of a potential character. Neil was the only different character, the only I actually enjoyed lmao. Wished he had more chances to be fleshed out. Cat was okay, I didn't quite understand her involvement in the 'Tenet' thing besides being the wife to Kenneth's character. Perhaps I missed something, apologies if I had. I couldn't understand the dialogue most of the time. Also Kenneth's character was confusing. I don't know where to begin.I think most of the money went to Tailors, Bulletproof vests, Yachts, and that 747.The action scenes were spectacular. Nolan did a good job with the direction and style. He's improved greatly. I believe the action scenes will not go forgotten. The only part I actually found entertaining. Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography is an unfailing wonderment. I daresay it will win an oscar for it. The colors remind me so much of Roger Deakins, but still pertaining to Hoyte's calm undertones. A signiture of his.Ludwig's music was another beauty in this air-filled donut. He's not a Hans Zimmer, mind you. But he does an exceptional job casting tension and uneasiness. I loved it.In my opinion, the film was not the best, but if you enjoy good cinematography and good music, this is your baby.To be short: Christopher Nolan was trying so hard to be Christopher Nolan.PS: Anyone found the sound effects too damn loud? Seriously, it's like ear rape loud."
2025,"Tenet is a very interesting movie. John David Washington is good as the protagonist, rather unimaginatively named 'The Protagonist.' Robert Pattinson is fantastic as the mysterious handler; Neil. Pattinson has really proven himself recently as a genuinely fantastic actor and I can't wait to see what he does next. Kenneth Branagh is a genuinely terrifying villain and his insanity shines through his disturbing interactions with his wife, Kat, played by Elizabeth Debicki, and the dynamic between those two characters is definitely the best part of the movie. The action is the clear selling point of the movie and it definitely delivers. It's incredibly exciting, heart pumping and thrilling, whilst being superbly shot. However the weak point for the film is the extremely complicated plot. If someone asked me what happened in Tenet, I would honestly struggle ro answer. I feel like I'll be spending the rest of my life frantically trying to figure out the plot. As well as being confusing, I'd say the film's runtime is also an issue. It's half an hour too long and, as it result, it leads to the film dragging a little at certain points throughout the runtime. As for weather or not I'd recommend this movie. Yes, I would. If you're brave enough to face the cinemas then the action should help take the current world issues off your mind for a while. However, just prepare for you head to be spinning like a wheel afterwards."
2026,"Not as easily accessible as Inception, which may turn off some viewers, but for those who love an amazing mind-bending thriller, Tenet delivers and then some. I agree it's a movie that demands repeated viewings. Overall, I think I still prefer Inception, but this is right there next to it with a fascinating story that's not to be missed."
2027,"Outstanding film experience, even with a mask and goggles on.This tale requires a lot of focus to understand. Much of the first half is spent world building which is absolutely required to understand how the technology works and the characters in play. By the end, the payoffs at each of the climaxes are totally worth the wait. Yes, plural.Visually, this film is going to blow your eyes wide open into stark white cue balls. So many ""oh my godddd whaaaat"" moments from beginning to end. Especially the ending 45 minute sequence, mixed with the tense score, will have you feeling like you just took molly and you feel the back of your head all tingly from the stimulation.Robert Pattinson is amazing in this and you will love him like a close friend. Better than his role in Good Time. Better than The Lighthouse. Better than the craziness of The King. Most of all this role for him has me hyped as hell for The Batman.I love the philosophical dialogue that they wrote about time, its effects, and the paradoxes. Can't speak too much on that without spoilers though."
2028,"I've NEVER seen such a disparity in reviews like I'm seeing here and now!! It seems like every single reviewer was either completely impressed or completely hated this movie! Either rating it a 10 or a 0, nothing in between! The reviews are extremely polarized! It makes it extremely difficult to decide if this is worth watching or not?! Considering it's around 2.5 hours long and requires a fair amount of risk, (with regards to catching the wuhan virus) by going to the theater to see this, it would be nice to know if it's actually worth seeing this, who would like it, and why?! None of these comments are addressing any of this.. just arguing about how great or horrible this movie is. This doesn't help!"
2029,"I was really looking forward to seeing this film having watched some of it being filmed in Italy last year. It was also sci-fi/action which I also really enjoy. Nolan is one of my favourite directors.Oh dear, the first problem was the dreadful sound quality. Trying to make out what everyone was saying over the loud soundtrack made me feel really stressed as I'm sure key plot information was lost. I put this down to an error at the cinema as it was their first day open after lockdown; but it seems I'm not the only one who craved an ear trumpet.The plot was so convoluted and confusing I found it exhausting. When my son turned to me & whispered 'have you got any idea what's going on?' I felt vindicated. I didn't particularly warm to any of the characters & couldn't work out why any of them were part of the story.I came away with that feeling of a half remembered dream, bits were intriguing or exciting But I couldn't quite piece it altogether. I will go back to watch it a second time & will get the home copy when available, at least I can put the subtitles on!The scenery was fantastic though."
2030,"BIT SPOILERSLets start with cons:-Great movie, as stated in the title it should have been at least 20/30 minutes longer to understand the last battle better. It's not complicated, just there are a lot of things going on too fast, and at the first view, even if the action is cool, it's easy to miss what is realy going on with those red and blue squads-Talking as an Italian viewer, the audio was perfect, maybe it was adgiusted in our version, i dont know, i've seen there are a lot of complains about it, but In the version i've seen every dialogue is totaly undesrtandable ( expect one time, but it's just a bit of metacinema that in the end feels good -Spoiler. Fist time in the airport the music is far too high, thats just because the second time they will go there, the music will be high due to the tension and i suppose the director just played the same music backwards, without adjusting the volume)
As i said, maybe it has been adjusted in the italian audio version.-Beside that, with good audio the movie feels great, of course it leave you with a bit of ""there must be more in this movie that what i've seen"" but thats tipical of Nolan movies, it's expected and shouldn't be considered a cons. In my opinion this not ruin the first view that is still pretty good.-It's not the best Nolan movie but i'm not reviewing this in ""Nolan scale"". it's not inception but i mean, which movie is incepiont other then inception? It's a pretty good movie still, far better then 95% of blockbusters out there.-It's not NOIR and i know that may disappoint some fans, i would like to see Nolan back on some noir stuff too but that's not the case, this movie is full action and plot. That's even why the charaters are stereotips. That is true, if you expect a good noir movie, with deep reflections, you can be disappointed.-There is a subplot that is not very important but it's more used as an introduction to the real movie. You may or may not like thisOk all the cons are gone in my opinion lets talk about the pro:-The movie feels dark, almost steampunk sometimes. It feels like realy serious about those time inversion like its a realy big deal, expecialy when the big bad boss controls the inversion and the enemy comes from the future.
That makes the movie feels strong and keep your attention high.-The story stay togheter pretty well, even with the obvious complexity of managing an ""almost time travel"" stuff, it feels, at least during a first view, that no logical barrier as been broken and all the pieces of the puzzle stays where they have too. Some explanation may be week, ok, but the overall feeling is pretty ok. If i will watch it a second time i'll back on this part.-The movie is obviously well made, but thats something i feel anyone knows even before going into the cinema. I mean, you don't expect this kind of movies to be poorly made. Nice touch the music played backwards-It's not boring. I know it seems stupid to say but i've seen a lot of people saying this movie is boring. Still it depends of your expectations but in my opinion this movie is not boring at all. The choice of limited background stories for charaters pay off pretty well. The movie leave to your imagination some of the ""Already seen 2000 times"" stuff and send you directly into the action."
2031,"Ok.. I can't blame anyone who couldn't understand the movie, I thought I was a real dumb after I watched it, and I am honestly.
No one ever could understand it enough to judge it from the first time, I've just read a piece in a website that explains every single detail in the movie, and it blows my mind. This movie is a masterpiece. I mean, when I watched it for the first time I thought it was good but not the best of Nolan's films, but now I'm sure that It is, no one ever can do what he does."
2032,"Ever since the first teaser for Christopher Nolan's ""Tenet"" came out, I've been excited for this movie.As a self-acclaimed Nolan fanboy I can say that I was extremely hyped for this movie. But for a director like Nolan who has brought films like Memento, Inception, Interstellar and many more incredible pictures, the stakes are pretty high - and this kind of concerned me. Nowadays it happens far too often that a good director cannot deliver just that little bit ""more"" that with hoped for.I watched the trailers, read some first impressions and watched no-spoiler reviews, which didn't really help me out because I felt like people either loved it or hated it. For those that haven't watched the movie yet, I really want to suggest not forming a certain concern involving any issue that critics and viewers have brought up - instead go check it out for yourself.I saw a bunch of people talking about a sound mixing issue, but I didn't experience any issues with that. My friend did tell me he thought the movie was ""loud"", but besides that nothing was wrong with it (maybe it depends on the cinema).Anyhow, while watching the movie I was on the edge of my seat. The cinematography is amazing, so are the set pieces. I absolutely loved the score too. I was pleasantly surprised by the acting delivered by Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki and John David Washington. In my opinion they did great. Of course the plot and the idea of inversion was something I had never seen before, which was great because it was something original and new (which is quite rare these days). I'd say Nolan absolutely nailed the thriller spy type of genre.Even though I went in with the mindset ""don't try to understand; feel it"", I ended up trying to puzzle everything together with my friends - and I loved that. We talked about the movie on our way back home for a long time, and I'm still thinking about it now. I feel like I understand, but I wouldn't be able to explain it. This is one of those movie where it's okay to be confused, that's part of the experience. I'm sure that when I watch ""Tenet"" again, I'll learn a lot of new things but I'll also have a lot of new questions.My verdict; 9/10. I'm not giving this movie a ten because I kind of missed having a connection to the protagonist. I know it was meant to be this way, but in my opinion a movie is more suspenseful when you have some sort of reason to like the main character (as in backstory). Besides that, I loved everything about this.Certainly go check it out for yourself!"
2033,"So, TENET is finally here and certainly entertaining. If it helps the big screen, the theaters and all the people working there, I am fine with having spent 10 EUR for my ticket.Alas, it is by far not a good Nolan film. As many reviews have already pointed out, there are a lot of problems with the characters, the plot and the central idea of inversion/time travel. You just have to look at the many Nolan masterpieces to realize that by his own standards, TENET is sub par in every aspect:Almost all of the action scenes are weak variations of what we have seen before. Take the chase sequence for example, it is less kinetic than any chase sequence from the Batman Trilogy. Compared to the highway chase from Matrix Reloaded, it is plane dull, unengaging and far away from mind-bending. The opera scene also seems weak and non-sensical compared to the many Batman raid scenes (Wall Street, Football Stadium). The cargo plane scene could be compared to the opening scene of TDK, but bigger is not better because it lacks the surprise and the tension of the latter and is ruined by the unnecessary assumption that anyone would fly around tons of pure gold and/or would need extra destraction when crashing a plane into a hangar.The rest of the action is somehow ridiculed by people running and ships moving backwards. In Inception, the dream sequences were unreal, but well explained and meaningful, so that you were left in awe by people floating around or skiing into a mountain fortress. In TENET all this seems cringeworthily comedic and somehow not involving at all. Only the one on one fight scene a the Freeport is interesting to watch, but it is - other than Inception's fight scenes - hard to follow. I can't tell if it makes sense in the context of inversion.The actors are really okay but given nothing they could really work with. There is no motivation and no connection between them. Kenneth Branagh is - except for one overdone scene - a good villain and his actions and behaviour are threatening, but you simply don't buy why he does all this. He is not a complicated, mysterious or menacing character at all, just ""the bad guy"". Joker would have had him for lunch. The cast lacks someone like Cilian Murphy who can unnerve you just with his presence if he is given a role that is not just one-dimensional.Many plot elements seem forced, unneccesary and illogical. Why would Kat be compromised by a false assessment of a fake Goya drawing? How would that make her hostage of her husband? No family court in the world would take that as a reason for taking her beloved son away. And why must her husband keep it in a Freeport facility? For tax reasons? Being the ruthless criminal that he is? That is just thoughtless writing.There are also a couple of scenes which play as a homage to bond films. Some of them are even genuine but it tells a lot when a fist fight involving a cheese grater sticks to your mind as one of the most involving scenes of the whole movie (and I am not quite sure if that scene is not heavily inspired by ""American Ultra"").All in all, TENET fails to involve and grip the audience, even on a big screen and in 4K resolution. You simply do not believe and you do not care about what you see. Cinematography and direction are superb, but we've seen that before in nearly every other Nolan flick. In the end, TENET looks like Amazon or Netflix trying to copy Nolan by spending tons of money, but lacking the heart and soul of his other films. You can't evade the impression it could have been a lot better had it been done more carefully, but was rushed to the end because of the pandemic."
2034,"The appearence of clever does not mean it's clever.
what it is is overly loud sound all the time, incomprehensible dailogue. if you get lost in the first quarter of an hour you've no chance of following any of this. all spectacle and shiny things but essentially hollow. zero character development. zero charm. zero humour. don't risk covid to see this. wait for dvd so you can replay bits. and have a break - this is a long film. and it sure feels like it at the end. average at best dressed up with a ridiculous 200 dollar plus budget..."
2035,"Honestly, this film pushed politics too hard for my liking. It failed on two major fronts. Firstly, it's too similar to his other works. Secondly, the movie was very distracting because of the (ahem) politics.
The story itself was fine. Nolan had one central idea that he exploited in limited ways. Debicki was Kat was a huge letdown (and quite frankly, very irritating). The music was annoying (which is unusual because I usually love the music in Nolan films).
This film's greatest strength is its locations and visuals. Once you strip that away, there's not a lot left.
Be prepared to be disappointed if you're a Nolan fan. If you haven't watched anything Nolan, you may like this movie.
Inception was a masterpiece. This film was mediocre in so many ways. It's still worth seeing, just lower your expectations."
2036,I'm a huge fan of thrillers. What a ride. Can't wait to watch again..
2037,"I went to see Tenet three days ago with high expectations based on the films trailer and Nolan's reputation. However, it was not long into the film that I started to lose interest and on two occasions felt I would soon be asleep unless I opened my eyes. That's how good it is, and my advice is don't waste time and money going to see this utter rubbish. The story is pure fantasy, the plot ridiculous, the dialogue is unintelligible - I just could not understand what the actors were saying most of the time - and the music score was a absolutely dreadful. The story was so hard to follow, I still do not know what it was all about to this day. Some way into the film three people walked out, later another two went and shortly after them I decided enough was enough, and so I left about 40 minutes from the end. Maybe the films storyline has been made so complicated so as to encourage multiple viewings to increase the films revenue, but I have no such intention. Some will say it is a masterpiece of cinematography and unmissable, but in just one showing six people, including myself, walked out during the film; and as it was a small audience due to COVID 19 Social Distancing, that says it all I think."
2038,"Christopher Nolan does it again, every movie he makes is always special, his movies manage to demonstrate the spectacular, but at the centre of his movies are the characters. They play such a huge and vital part in taking the story along,which is why even with the convoluted plot lines of a Nolan movie, the movie goer has a vested interest as they feel a strong sense of connection with the characters. Here is where Tenet misses, I feel Nolan held the concept of the movie with higher regard than he did on the story or the characters. I didnt feel as worried or connected to some of the characters as I did in Inception, Interstellar or The Prestige. Its not that it does not happen, it does, but only after about an hour of the movie do you feel for the characters. However, it just shows how excellent Nolan is as a director as everyone compares his own movies to each other. All I will say is Tenet does not hold up great to Nolans other works, but against most movies coming out from Hollywood nowadays? It is a world beater. As Nolan himself says, he wants his audience to ""feel the movie"" and Tenet does excatly that. Side note: You will have to watch it a second time, I cant wait to watch it a second time to pick up on everything."
2039,"I understand people who say it was loud and can see why they say the characters have minimal background too them but I'm sure this is not a fault of a film that is more of THE point of the film!!! It literally is an excellent Nolan take on espionage and to be fair look at bond we knew very little about him until Skyfall because you really don't need too it's not the point of these type of movies. How can some people say the women parts of his films are insignificant and others say that Debeckis performance is outstanding for example. How can some people call it humourless when others quite clearly see humorous parts to this movie. Yes it's big Yes it's loud (I thought the score was among Nolan's best movie scores Zimmer or not) Yes it's complicated but if that is the point of this movie how is that a failure? Also big up Robert Pattison an actor who is really going places by the way. I for one am going back to the cinema for another watch. I for one enjoy how Nolan can make an original take on so many different genre of movie and still keep me entertained. All his movies are so different but so good for it. As much as inception is one of the best movies of all time I don't want to go see that every time he makes a movie and I'm glad he is willing to always try something totally different and believe that's how all his films should be judged not by comparing it to his amazing back catalogue. Tenet is awesome if you go into it expecting it to be as someone aptly said ""BOND ON ACID"". Nolan is THE director of big budget cinema that we need!!! We all complain we have seen it all before. Why don't people stop regurgitating old ideas. But then people seem all too willing to rubbish anything different. This film is an action/spy thriller done on a massive scale. And done beautifully!!! If you want something other than that just stay at home. But you would have missed something special."
2040,"Christopher Nolan's grand blockbuster arrives in multiplexes during Covid 19 to much anticipation. However, as far as critics go, I think the Guardian's Catherine Shoard got it right - it's a bit of a dud. Most guys will find this movie awesome - it is like a tinkly bling Mercedes with gull doors, but ladies might dislike it's deliberate intellectual posturing.Never has such an obviously fantastic looking film been so intent on sabotaging itself. I think Mr Nolan has to remember that in the end, such movies have to be entertaining. So we have the first half of the film, which is a fantastic nod to a Bond movie - it's gloriously and excitingly done - suddenly morph in the second half of the film into something like Back to the Future part III , but without all the excitement or humour. People move forward while everything else moves backward. There are large scale action sequences where half of the people are shooting bullets (going forward in time), while another half of the people are catching bullets (inverted in time), ALL THE WHILE with the background objects in the scene moving BACKWARDS in time. I have also been having an issue with Nolan's big actions sequences - since Inception. Scenes of people running around shooting at each other become repetitive and lacks coherence. Its just not exciting - compared to the final battle in ""The Outpost"", as an example. But the final action sequences in Tenet, although obviously handsomely and impressively mounted, is a dead bore. Mainly because we're trying to figure out who the hell are going back or forward in time (made worse by the fact that everyone is wearing combat fatigues). I also have issue with Nolan purposely filming key conversations in a deliberately undecipherable manner (lots of fury and background noises). A key conversation between the hero and the villain is shouted out above the roar of wind and waves on a speeding catamaran, for example. Why would you do that? I can't hear!! Again, maybe that's the point.I think the director needs to remember that these kinds of movies need to be exciting. And it can't be exciting if the audience is scratching their heads for most of the climax of the film. Telling your audience to ""don't understand it, just feel it"" is fine, but I just didn't get the excitement. I was just sitting there trying to figure out who is going forward or backward in time.This is not to say Tenet is a bad film. Far from it, technical execution is virtuosic in complexity (all the backward forwards action is used to amazing effect in several gunfights and especially a superb car chase), John David Washington is unflappably suave (just like a Black James Bond) and Robert Pattinson has morphed into a charismatic performer, a far cry from his Twilight days. I just felt that the time bending narrative is just overdone, and it kind of spoilt the show."
2041,"First viewing at IMAX the sound effects and music drowned out the dialogue. For a movie this complex, not being to hear the dialogue was very disappointing. I don't know if it was the cinema or the IMAX specifically that made the mix all wrong.Second viewing at standard cinema the mix was perfect. I picked up so much more.Such an amazing complex mind bender.I think I will see this a few more times just to try to peel away another layer.Definitely see it more than once. The second viewing was way more enjoyable for me."
2042,"I truly believe this will be this years inception, many people will enjoy this movie but i think we can all agree on why it came out during these covid times: Nolan obviously knew you need to watch this movie 5 times before you get it so they will get their money back"
2043,"I give 7,5 to this movie, but I think I could change it in future to give it a full 8, because this movie needs necessarily a rewatch or maybe two, to really appreciate it, its depth and the story in every single beautiful detail.In any case, a must watch and a wonderful way to back to the cinemas after the anti-COVID mesures."
2044,"Now, I am a fairly smart guy and I've watched difficult films to grasp in the past with not many problems but I almost walked out of the movie theater because i couldn't fathom the main concept of the film. Only other movie I stopped before ending it because I didn't understand it was Primer. This is some Primer level mindboggling.Maybe even worse.
I recommend to the average viewer to either decide to watch it twice in the movie theate (and read some stuff about it before) or don't watch it at all and wait for it to become available and then watch it on your computer so that you can pause, think and maybe google some stuff to understand this film.
For example, I love Inception and I honestly believe that not too many people understood the level of complexity behind it in its entirety. But Inception's main concept and story was understood but most viewers. This is a different case. If you can't understand the concept even at a surface level you can't possibly enjoy the film. I think it's safe to say Nolan went too deep in his labyrinth mind and he non-apologetically created a film that doesn't take the right approach to explain it's convoluted concept to the viewer. If this wasn't directed by Nolan and people were honest, believe me it would have lower ratings. Walking out of the theater i heard most people saying they didn't understand anything. But you know many people don't want to sound dumb to their friends and theirselves, hence the rating. I am not saying this is a bad film. I am saying chances are you won't get it so beware spending your money and risking going to a movie theater (covid-19 aside)."
2045,"Yesterday I saw Tenet, and after seeing it, I was fairly dissapointed. Nolan has build a reputation of making great movies, that revolve around a big scale of events, which Tenet delivers on. The action scenes and the special effects are amazing. I especially want to give a shoutout to the fight choreography, who invented the backwards fighting. This gave the movie a very unique feel.Unfortuantely the soundmixing was not all that great. The fight sequences were extremely loud, while the audio was a normal volume. From other reviews I heard a lot of people had issues with this mixing, where some theaters played everything really loud, while some had unhearable dialogue. This mixing made me dread going into the next action sequence, knowing how loud every part of it would be.The pacing of the movie also felt very rushed. Earlier on in development there were rumors that Tenet would be 3 hours long. It is possible that this was indeed the case and that the original 3 hour movie was paced a lot better. Unfortunately I can't judge that movie, only the one I have seen. Especially the first 30 minutes felt very rushed, where it felt we were hopping from country to country. Some more time to let us breath in the beginning, and to let us know our protaganist would have served the movie well.In the movie we never really get to see our characters. They constantly do stuff, but the actions that happen have sometimes more then a week of time in between them. It would have been nice to have them interact in some way, or emote over what was going on. I really missed a bonding between characters. The most we get of that is the last scene of the movie, which is like getting appatiser after dinner. I also found the female lead to be quite annoying. Her only motivation was constantly talking about her son. Even hearing people say that the world was gonna end she awnsered by saying; ""does that mean my son will die as well?""... This really isn't characterising her, but just using her son as a prop trying to convince us she is like us. Dont we all love our families?These issues really lowered the quality of the movie for me, but the technical aspects are still verry good. The acting was solid and the music was pretty good. There were some minor plot holes/goofs, which didn't affect me from enjoying the movie. The cinematogrophy was pleasant to watch. Overall I would give tenet a solid 6. It's a good action movie, but the issues mentioned above hinder it for me from being anything more then that."
2046,"20 minutes in I'm thinking this is good. 45 mins its starting to lag. 55 minutes in I'm thinking this is a convoluted mess. 1h 30 in I'm thinking I was too quick to judge. 2h I'm in thinking its good. 2h 30 in the credits roll and I admire how ambitious Nolan is as a director once again. Yet film has serious flaws.You thought Inception was confusing. It's simplistic in comparison, but probably more accessible and interesting conceptually. Plotwise the story of Tenet is wrote, but well told, maintaining momentum through constantly shifting goals, stakes and urgency. In terms of mechanics, it definitely the most ambitious and interesting approach to time travel since Primer, with less is more specification embedded in physics - but without Interstellars unforgivable ""love is measurable universal force"" hokum. Effects are interesting and technically Nolan is as ever this generation's unsurpassed director for physical stuntwork. Throughout Nolan adopts a revisionist approach to his own filmaking, critically assessing and seeking to improve iterations of his previous work, at times succeeding such as the final end piece.Yet at other points he (knowingly?) pokes fun at himself (unbeknownst?), mining his own back catalogue to make what seems a to be a reverential pastiche of his signature stylings. Speaking of pastiches, the 'character' potrayed by John David Washington is beyond approach (yet well acted if this was the intent), an arrogant hubristic American action hero in the mould of Jack Burton with none of the charm. Was Dominic Cobb of Inception too moody, too developed...well here's the cut-rate version kicking ass and talking sass in this year's self proclaimed protagonist you hope to never see a sequel about. What growth he experiences is fundamentally undermined by his excruciating clunky dialogue. Brannagh is serviceable as ever going full Bond villain and refining his earlier Ruski attempt from Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit. Pattison steals the show, undeniably the best performance in the film, the guys a serious actor and elevates this every moment he's on screen. Nolan knows everybody loved Tom Hardy's classy Brit in Inception, so basically lampshades him here with Pattinson...and then doubles down with Aaron Taylor Johnsons very similar character (also excellent).Overall as Nolan's budgets increase, he has constantly expanded his ambition. Where Inception felt like his homage to the Matrix for a new generation, Tenet feels like his homage to Inception. It's a glossy remake in all but name, but there's too much attachment to that formula and he cant recapture the original taste despite following the recipe lavishly. Overall, it's a solid movie where again Nolan tries a little too hard - not always a bad thing."
2047,"This movie is actually an 8/10 but I've dropped 2 points because you can't hear the dialogue.The sound mixing is off, theres always something blasting over the dialogue, whether it be the score or wind or boots stomping or gun fire or sound effects or a car engine.Truly an amazing movie with great replay value but the sound is fundamentally off.Perhaps a home media or directors cut will remedy the mixing."
2048,"IMDb is my go to reference for TV and movies because once you disregard the 9 and 10s Stars from the company shills and the 1 and 2 Stars from the haters you can usually get a very good understanding of the movie or TV program. I read 30 or 40 of the reviews on IMDb before going to see Tenet and thought the 9 and 10s were over the top reviews. Having seen the movie I can assure you that they were certainly NOT over the top. Tenet was superb from start to finish. I didn't have any problem following the plot, the acting was outstanding especially from the main cast. The direction exceptional. Perhaps I was prepped to a degree by reading reviews in as much as knowing somewhat what to expect but I had no trouble following the plot, I understood perfectly why the dialogue was hard to understand at times due to the confines of the plot . I certainly will be spending on a ticket to see it a second, and perhaps even a third time, on the big screen just to absorb the nuances of the story line again. Why a 9 and not a 10? A 10 would indicate a perfect score and no movie is quite perfect but ...... Tenet was BLOODY close!"
2049,"I'm so confused about something. Just like they teach in chemistry if you break a glass there's a million particles everywhere of said broken glass, to reverse that you'd need to do the EXACT (mirror) same thing in a backwards motion to redo the action so how is this possible in the movie? When the protagonist is fighting hinself from the past in that freeport room with the 3 bullets in the glass he isn't doing the reverse of what he did he is just defending hinself against himself to get through (outside) to see Neil bring Kat who is now saved. This makes no sense to me, idk if I'm missing something. Also, how unrealistic is it to expect hin to remember every fight move he did in the forward direction to do it backwards?? They chuck it up to instinct but never explain wth that even means... Just a feeling but ok what is that feeling is it a superpower or something? Makes no sense.Also, if Neil just meets the protagonist in the future but dies after meeting him in that bomb area where we see the string how can the consistency of the theme of infinite loops (which is what this movie is alluding to at one point protagonist says to the indian woman ""you have to stop thinking linearly"") be possible? He died there so how would he ""un-die"" to then reverse again and meet him in the future? Neil is basically going in reverse since he met the protagonist? So how does that work when he switches while hes with the protagonist in different scenes? They play around with grandfather paradoxe but then show that fate is kinda playing a part here because Neil changes direction from when he leaves the helicopter with blue team and saves the protagonists life by shooting the guy at the gate of the detonation and in turn dying himself there.Idk I read explanations but I'm still lost. Maybe it's cause I question everything and the more complexe stuff you delve in the more plotholes it generally has (I mean this fantasy and wishy washy pseudo-science as explanations on how this time thing originated they chuck it up to ""we don't know someone in the future does don't question it""). I get it's Nolan, it's still a cool movie and all and I loved many others of his a lot, but when you get into these questions it becomes clear there's many plotholes (beyond what I mentioned as well). Enjoyable, but not consistent (imo)."
2050,This is more sci fi then thriller. Action scenes are good and this movie is absolutely amazing and exciting. It remind me on Avengers: Endgame and Harry Potter and Prisoner of Azkaban. This isn't Inception or The Dark Knight trilogy but anyway its excellent movie. i hope this will be in the IMDb top 250.
2051,"I watched it at the cinema and I found it boring, it started well and then sort of lost the plot and it was all down hill from there. I think Nolan is the reason for the high ratings. The special effects was boring. The acting mediocre. The story complicated. Not bad and worth watching but in my opinion there are much better films out there tgat got a much worse rating. I don't trust ratings on Dirty Rotten Tomatoes. I'm surprised thecrating was so high on IMDB though as the ratings on IMDB are usually ratings I agree with. This was an excepiin and average to say the least. I almost walked out of the cinema I was so bored and took catching covid 19 to watch this in my local Vue cinema. So disappointed."
2052,"If you really want to enjoy TENET you have to pay attention, do not go to the toilet you will miss a LOT & if you're with someone its best you don't speak with them until the end. View it in the biggest & and immersive screen if you can
.
Now the plot seems simple when you go into the movie an agent trying to prevent WW3 but really its not easy it's one of those movies where you have to pay attention to every single detail. The first act is pretty easy to follow I'm not gonna lie but then comes the second act where most of the characters are introduced (either in the start of the second half or the end of the second act) and a lot of shit happens in the second act that gets very very confusing and the sound and score in the background most of the time get so loud where to the point you can't even hear characters say especially Kenneth Branagh's character idk maybe it's me I've been told that the IMAX versions are better. The third act loosens down a bit as its pretty much just minuets of epic action and vfx and as the movie continues imo it gets easier and easier.
.
The action has to be the best thing about the movie the stunts are so well done and it's just so fucking enjoyable there's one whole action sequence I really enjoyed where the plane crashes I'm sure its shown in the trailer every minute of that scene is just so damn fun to watch. The characters are all unique in its own way and that's what I really admire about them and Nolan's writing he always makes sure to have something interesting for every character in script. If I'm being honest, I found Pattinsons character more interesting and cooler than Washington's character. Every time Pattinson's character appeared, I was always excited and intrigued. Another character that got me intrigued every time he appeared was Himesh Patel's character Mahir what I liked about him so much was his charisma and his high esteem. All the other characters were great especially the villain I wish a good few of them were explored more. He didn't scare me, but he would have me stressed lmao.
.
Filmmaking wise this is a very well-made movie not really surprised because its bloody Christopher Nolan his movies are always well made but it isn't as on par as his other movies like Inception or TDK. Direction as always was of a very high standard Nolan really knows what he's doing right or wrong. Script is smartly written you really have to pay attention with the dialogue like I said to enjoy it which I find odd but in a good way. Acting is like the direction very high standard and it is very good the cast is very talented, and all have many great moments and damn I really love Robert Pattinson's acting and his hair man his hairstyles are always flawless. Score from Ludwig Göransson is amazing it so surprising TENET isn't composed by Zimmer I really love Ludwig's effects on the audience its so tense yet satisfying at the same time.
.
I told this to my friend, and I think it's stupid, but Nolan could legit launch a whole college course/PHD all based on the TENET universe and I would take it it's a lot of explaining. I've basically seen the whole internet comparing this to Inception or either say they're connected but I wont comment on that cause this is non spoiler but I would say that Inception is more easy to understand and its explained very straight forward compared to this a second watch is indeed required. In the end just enjoy TENET I think you'll think its okay or love it like I did despite the confusion fingers crossed I can have a second viewing before school starts8.2/10 or 8/10"
2053,"In true Nolan fashion we get a big production based on some kind of scientific concepts (loosely introduced) seasoned with questionable hints of a ""bigger picture"" or ""higher purpose"". It's not necessarily the pseudo-science or the illogical explanation the movie proposes which bother me the most, but rather the execution, the ""fake complexity"" that it's almost a trademark of this type of Nolan films, the endless dialogues where layers upon layers of rules are added to the way the whole universe works.
Does this ""fluff"" bring value to the film? Does it make the story more interesting, more compelling? It's up to you to decide.
Oh, plus the acting is generally mediocre"
2054,"After waiting for so many months and many push-backs due to corona, Christopher Nolan's Tenet finally hits theaters. I am lucky enough to have seen it now in my region.I am not the biggest Nolan fanboy, I used to love his films when I was younger, but after growing up, I realised his films are only big spectacle, even if it is good spectacle (which it is) but far away from THE pinnacle of cinema as many other Nolan fanboys try to claim it to be. But nonetheless, he is still a talented director who puts out the more interesting Hollywood blockbusters to the public, considering the fact that brain-dead superhero movies are currently infesting the film market. And off course I was excited to go and see it.My feelings are currently mixed. I will have to wait off a few days until I give it a definitive rating, but I have to say this. The scope of this film is just beyond anything Nolan has ever touched, it might be the biggest film he's ever done in terms of scope and the story. The film was never boring at a single minute, every minute flew by quickly, it is indeed a fast paced adventure. The cinematography is pure eye candy, surely one of Nolan's best looking films he has done, and that is saying a lot, but the fact that the movie took place in so many different locations surely helped that matter of fact because it takes place in Mumbai, Tallinn, Siberia, London, Oslo, this film went everywhere around the world just like if I was experiencing a James Bond film. In terms of all the technical aspects, this film is a pure masterpiece, from the sound design and mixing, the cinematography, the Color grading and Color palette, it is a technical marvel. And the great music adds to the film so much and gets you excited for every scene, even if Ludwig Göransson ain't no Hans Zimmer. The acting was, as usual, fantastic from everyone involved.At the other hand, this film went overboard with its story. Even if you activate all of your brain for this film, you will still be left confused for this film. This film requires ofc all of your attention, but it will still confuse you no matter what. This is the kind of film that will require 3-4 viewings, not because I believe it's a masterpiece, but just to get to understand some of the concepts this film is trying to bring to the table. There will be many audience members who will leave the theater saying that it's ""all nonsense"" or ""just pretentious"", but I think Nolan just put the gear this time to level 6 instead of his usual level 3-4.At the end of the day, I have conflicting opinions about it, I think that I tend more towards liking the film since I did have my fun with this film to a certain extent, but I need some time to process all of which I have seen. I still don't know if I consider this a very smart film that brought the concept of time to a whole new level or if it's a pretentious disappointment that tries to over-complicate a super-simple story (or to put it more simple: if it is Nolan's best or worst). I will see.*originally posted on my Letterboxd account*"
2055,"Visually and tecnichally is a masterpiece in order to demostrate what a good director is Nolan but after this you have an ilogical plot (and I am not speaking about the timetravel), long and soulless with too manyy action scenes in which I didn´t experiment any feeling at all apart of the confusion , the films tries to give some emotion with the music, but for me, it fails to achieve it."
2056,"Hey umm i would like to order... a complex female character who is kind of important to the story, is that possible?
Oh, you have a pretty blonde whose entire purpose in life is her child and whose only relevance to the plot is being a victim to her husband's evil schemes?
Hmm, you got anyone else that could not have been easily written out of the movie?
No?
Well that's too bad."
2057,"Ugh. No thanks. Tries too hard. I was confused through most of it and then became bored because I gave up trying to follow. I love Nolan's movies, but this one missed the mark for me."
2058,"When yacht scenes happening I totally assumed that i am in a Bond movie with some weird s***. Arms dealer as an enemy, bond girl (which is very tall among actors and with nun type dressing), skilful agent with suit, out of no where romantic decisions and so on...Anyway about movie; bad casting, mediocre acting, terrible costumes, bad writing... the only thing which reminds Nolan is cinematography and colours. ohh yeaa I forgot and the time travel or bending...I am very disappointed after 7 months without cinema. I think he is one of the most talented director and writer in our generation. I wont judge him with this garbage. In my opinion, he needs to rest a bit and create new original characters. He seems to start to create bad copy of his previous brilliant works. Btw WHERE IS ZIMMER!?"
2059,"Not terrible but not that good
Loved interstellar & his batman effortsActing not good as I think the cast were confused by the plot & the characters they were supposed to play They are like mono cardboard cutouts delivering their lines as if reading off a script for the 1st timeIf your curious wait for it to appear on Netflix at least you can turn off half way though without it spoiling your nightNolan doesn't possess the talent of someone like Hitchcock or Tarantino if capturing the attention of his audienceTenet seems like a fairly forgettable B movie but one that's had a bigger budget"
2060,"Horrible ""time travel"" plot.
Annoying techno music banging in every scene.
Lots of unnecessary scenes dragging movie 2hr.
Would've walked out had I not been taken there to celebrate my birthday."
2061,"Access my profile and see for yourself, every other Christopher Nolan film ever made has a perfect 10/10 from me. Needless to say I probably expected too much from this one, but within the first 5 minutes I adjusted my expectations because I saw that this film is not going to be an epic like the ones we got used to.Christopher Nolan goes back to his Memento roots by telling a story backwards, because if this film has to make sense to you, you need to know what the ending will hold. That's why people claim it's so great the second time around... The only problem is, a film that isn't great the first time you see it, usually isn't worth seeing a second time.This film had 3 major problems.
1. The music: it was terrible, the sound balance was wrong and the music didn't tell any story related to the film. No Soundtrack CD sales will come from this, where the OST from Interstellar and Inception became legendary.
2. The framing: The shots were flimsy and seemed more like a Shane Carruth budget than a big studio backed film. It broke the story's most important part and never draws you in.
3. The bad writing: Everyone will agree that the film was not great the first time around, it doesn't make sense, not because it's complex, but because you aren't informed of whatever is going on. The leading male understands concepts that aren't simple to grasp, as if he has an IQ of 250+ but an audience member with a higher IQ than Nolan (that's rare) will not even grasp it as quickly despite knowing what the film is about.The acting wasn't great if you take into account John David is the leading role. He was perhaps the only actor who disappointed. Pattinson and Debicki really impressed though, but they didn't get all that much screentime.The first part of the movie is hard to follow, mainly because the music is so extremely loud and overwhelms the dialogue without telling the story together, but also because the viewer isn't given any info about what's going on, and you have to watch until half way for things to make sense. The problem then becomes that the second half is extremely predictable.I didn't enjoy this film. The action sequences were great, but even John Wick pulled that off with minimal dialogue and no complex ideas.P.S. I'm not dumb and it's not as if I didn't understand the film, I did... My IQ is in fact higher than Nolan's, but he could've done it so much better if he took a bit more time on it."
2062,"Tenet is a sci-fi spy film written and directed by Christopher Nolan. Starring John David Washington and Robert Pattinson, it yet again proves that Nolan is one of the best modern filmmakers and that the craft of his work should never be overlooked.In Kiev, Ukraine, the unnamed Protagonist (John David Washington) is working undercover for the CIA to help pull off a heist to steal a mysterious object from the Russians. When the Russians catch wind of him being a double agent, the Protagonist is tortured but manages to take a suicide pill before he reveals any classified information. Some time later, the Protagonist wakes up discovering that the pill was fake and that he has now been recruited to do a job for a secret organisation, who provide him with the codeword ""Tenet"" and a new technology not yet known to the general public.There's a reason someone like Christopher Nolan is held in such high regard by many cinemagoers - he is part of a dying breed of mainstream filmmaker whose unique view of the world around him has brought us a plethora of fascinating, memorable, and often surreal movies that have endured pop culture for several years. With ""Tenet"", Nolan has once again challenged the audience's perception of the way they may see things, in this instance, time in motion. Right from the get-go, we are thrust into the bizarre reality of our Protagonist as he tries to come to terms with this strange time-related technology that only a limited amount of people know how to use properly. He is just as confused as we are, and that makes him all the more suitable in having him guide us through what would otherwise be a complicated and convoluted story. Of course, like Nolan's 2010 film ""Inception"", it is required that we pay attention to every intricate detail in order to fully understand everything that is happening and this includes every action, every reaction, and every line of dialogue. Naturally, this will prove off-putting and frustrating to some viewers, especially newcomers, but I believe anyone who has been following Nolan's work for as long as I have should have little to no trouble.As to be expected, Nolan doesn't hold back on the action scenes and large scale setpieces. In spite the film's long runtime of 150 minutes, it never felt like there was any filler or padding. Every bullet fired and every big explosion served a purpose, not merely being there for entertainment but also to advance the story forward. It is difficult for me to go into detail about what action scenes stood out to me the most without spoiling the entire story so in the spirit of this film, I will use a codeword to signify what my favourite part was - ""airport"". The brilliant use of editing and the lack of CGI during ""airport"", the latter of which Nolan has gone on record saying he strongly dislikes putting into his films, is up there with the likes of The Joker's truck flipping over in ""The Dark Knight"" in terms of how visceral it felt. This is further proof of how far a filmmaker like Nolan will go to entertain his audience and how much he values our time as a consumer, unlike others who are all about show and no substance.As previously seen in 2018's ""BlacKkKlansman"", John David Washington is more than capable of holding his ground as a leading man, even in the shadow of his famous father. Washington plays his role not simply as a man with a gun shooting at bad guys but that of someone constantly questioning his own reality and whether he has picked the right side or not. His interactions with the other characters made for some great conversations about existential topics like how we are responsible for our own destiny and what the future could hold for us if we keep going down the same path we are already on. Robert Pattinson also gave a nice complimentary performance to that of Washington's, bringing something of a nice balance to any moments of tension the movie may throw at us. The friendly chemistry between these two actors makes me hope that the two will work together again in a future project.After eleven films and three decades in the business, it seems like Christopher Nolan's knack for telling original stories and offering commentary on life itself is in no danger of waning. Like ""Inception"" before it, ""Tenet"" seems like it will be the talking point of many conversations about one's perception of time and reality for several years to come. Of course, there will be the usual detractors who label this as ""pretentious"" or ""boring"", but that is to be expected of someone as bold and daring as Nolan, who isn't afraid to try new things. How long until we can expect to see Nolan's next epic? At this point, I can only wait patiently in great anticipation.I rate it a solid 9/10"
2063,Didnt really understand a damn thing... too confusing?
2064,This is by far one of my favourites from Nolan's. I guess im going to watch it a second time to fully comprehend the picture.
2065,"What? POWPOWPOWCRASHBOOM!!!! 🤷‍♀️Loud, confusing, maybe I'm just dumb. Guess I'll watch it again to see if I understand it (?)The VFX are cool."
2066,"Cons:
One time decided to go the the cinema to realize all main characters lack total display of emotions and personality clashing with a suggested super human size story. Oh God and save me the physics continuity bs.Pro: Special effects"
2067,"Am huge Nolan fan but this movies missed some marks here and there. 1. With complex sotry line one needs clear and to the point dialogues (Not Mumbling) which I found that the protagonist was often doing. Why didn't the final edit catch it?
2. Editing between crucial dialogues seemed very childlike to put it nicely. And editing needs a review....may be a director cut is needed to watch again?
3. I was not impressed by the lead character's performance/acting, after amazing performances of previous lead roles in Nolan movies (Leo/Mathew)...why? Appeared to be fresh actor without any experience.....sad. Here I was disappointed but over all good story which needed all of the above in full perfection. Thank you."
2068,"I can see why many people disliked the movie and found it convoluted or hard to follow. On a first viewing not everyone will get it.
I risk sounding pedantic, but being a sci-fi fan and familiar with concepts of overlapping timelines and time travel, I had no problem following (or at times predicting) the complex story that Nolan masterfully penned and directed for our amazement. Movies like Primer, Memento and Predestination have touched on the subject of multiple viewpoints across an self intersecting looped timeline or split editing before, but Nolan has just raised the bar to an insane level on a fast paced, action packed, intelligent film that deserves multiple views.
Hollywood spits so much watered down, committee movies these days that its truly refreshing to see a smart jewel shine among the generic pop corn flicks landscape.Bravo Nolan!"
2069,"Sator Arepo Tenet Opera Rotas is a Latin palindromic square, reading the same way front, back up or down. A clever conceit for a film that explores the impact of a narrative that plays the same backwards as forwards.I'm glad I'm not the only one who couldn't hear half the dialogue over the sound design. Was this deliberate? Because I read the synopsis and I didn't miss any of the broad strokes, but the finer nuances completely escaped me.Like why I should care about any of these characters or their relationships. For a film that emphasizes the importance of the Protagonist, everyone else gets a name but he doesn't. I found that strange and off-putting. And the ""mother's love"" that rang completely hollow. Like I'm supposed to care about the parent child relationship of a woman whose interaction with her child is reduced to a chauffeur - whether on a boat or in front of a school.Too much is explained in this film and not enough is shown.It was like the characters have been reduced to ciphers that serve as expositors of the high concept but in no way inhabit any real emotional dimension in past present or future reality. It's like the dialogue has been deliberately obscured in the sound design so as to prevent us from observing glaring logical inconsistencies as the premise hangs together by a single red thread.I love Nolan's work but this movie I don't love. I don't hate it either. I just found it flat, confusing, inaudible, and at points utterly risible, like I was watching Nolan disappearing up his own wazoo. And that provided some unintentional entertainment value of its own."
2070,"Haven't been to a movie theater in six months and it felt good to be back. Christopher Nolan returns with another globe trotting thriller. Like Inception he tries again to be innovative and clever although instead of dreams, he focuses on time travel, sort of. The film was neither easy to follow or compelling; it felt tedious most of the way through. The empty and unbelievable characters didn't help either me care either. While I do enjoy the talents of John David Washington and Robert Pattinson, I felt that they were miscast. Fortunately Tenet redeems itself with a decent ending, good action scenes, and a very thrilling score. I will definitely give it a rewatch."
2071,"Just watch tenet
Nolan wins The heart First i watch it difficult to uderstand but second time you found this is Master piece"
2072,"Christopher Nolan's Tenet has such an amazing concept, but falls short. Shame because I had such high hope's for this movie.The editing was probably the worst I've ever seen. It kept cutting too quickly during conversations, making it feel too scripted and had no natural feel to it. The timing to jump from one scene to the next was odd and only left me more confused and wondering what happened between those scenes.The audio wasn't great either. Can barely understand what the actors were saying. Background noise was louder than the actors speaking, making it even harder to follow and leaving you confused as to who the bad guy was, what he wanted and what the protagonists were gonna do about it.The writing was pretty cheesy and the acting was below average. Characters were poorly written and you couldn't care less about any of the characters in the film. No emotional connecting between them and the viewer.I love almost all of Nolans films and I'm just disappointed with this one. And it pains me to say this, but it could possibly be his worst one yet."
2073,"Nolan has done it again. Through intricate and complicated time sequence scenes, Nolan did his best what he is good at."
2074,"SPOILERSThe movie was just completely mind warping in a good way. While the idea of time manipulation has been used in the past, the way it is used in this movie is new and fresh. Throughout the beginning of the movie, I had a slight fear of it being cheesy with the classic military use of a new invention and it possibly causing the destruction of the planet, but the cheesiness is, in a sense, avoided later on with the complexity of the plot later on. I feel like there are some confusions that could be made. For example, how is the Protagonist able to go back in time far enough to speak to Neil and have him join his fight? It would take a lot of time in inversion to do so especially if Neil said he had been working with the Protagonist for years. Is this a way of saying that another form of time manipulation is available (i.e. possibly time travel) so that the Protagonist can speak to Neil? Because whatever the Protagonist would have said would be inverted so Neil wouldn't understand him. Anyways, the movie is pretty well thought out, but obviously there could always be more clarification. It sounded like by the way the movie ended, that Nolan might try making a second movie to it, which could end up explaining more, but we'll see."
2075,"It was tough, intense, smart and, as usual, mind-bending. In my opinion, Mr. Nolan probably knew that he screwed up Inception at the end and he tried to fix it this time. The good news is he does it! With even better storytelling, logic, a more plausible ending and most importantly, without any loose ending.Tenet is tough to understand at times and I'm not sure whether I got it full or not. In fact, is it a scientific possibility or not I don't have any idea about it. And Christopher knows that too. He teased at the start: ''You don't understand it, right? Don't try to!''Matter-anti-matter, body-anti-body, version,-inversion, x-1/x, symmetry with the exact opposite, reciprocal, palindromic.... whichever term you use to define things, it's all in here. Christopher, once again, created the anti-universe in reply to the universe, where time is the only constant and you can't create any anti-time! I have seen movies with parallel reality, alternate reality or history, and, here, this one is about anti-reality. It also got elements from Back to the Future and Terminator at some points. And it leaves you with the feeling that you just watched another James Bond movie!Liked it, loved it and definitely want to re-see it!"
2076,"I think people, giving less than 8 points, are just to dumb to understand the film. The acting is great, the music is great, the story is unbelievable complex but also unbelievable great and the action scenes are incredible. There is nothing bad at this film.I watched it twice and the movie got even better with the second time."
2077,"Great return for director Chris Nolan
Lead actor is superb - The concept of the film is very original and the twists and turns keep you on edge - coupled with a great sound score - really enjoyable film"
2078,"Yeah, the movie is complicated. That does not mean it's bad. Tenet is a masterpiece from Nolan who outdid himself once again. This is a movie you have to watch multiple times so you can fully understand it. Great story, great acting and the picture is brilliant."
2079,I like complicated movies that require working my brains to the limit. Tenet is one of them.
2080,"T E N E T review by Janusz Madej
One cryptic sentence seemed to be used constantly in marketing of the latest blockbuster the 'T E N E T"" written and directed by Christopher Nolan which has been shown it trailers:
""All I have for you is a word: Tenet. It'll open the right doors, some of the wrong ones too.""
When last year first teasers were relisted the audience were privy to a few scenes shrouded in mystery.
The plot was largely unknown and all we knew is that Nolan is working on a film which will center on the world of international espionage.The veil of mystery and ongoing rumors about the plot drove the anticipation of the audience to the limit and in times of pandemic T E N E T was touted as the potential savior of the film industry.
When expectations are so high it is easy to get disappointed...
I really wanted to like this film, in fact ever since the filming started I felt that this was the most anticipated movie of the year for me. Lensed by current frequent collaborator Hoyte van Hoytema with depthful Nolan script writing I knew we are looking for a treat. The plot is hard to communicate without trying to explain too much:
""Armed with only one word, Tenet, and fighting for the survival of the entire world, a Protagonist journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that will unfold in something beyond real time.""
Let me start by saying that the T E N E T is not Nolan's best work.
In essence the premise for it is more enchanting then its execution. As with Nolan's previous movies this one feels a bit overindulgent. When director maintains full creative power over film making process he is running a risk of disconnection from the audience.
Chris always makes movies for intellectual audience and expects them to do their part by being as smart as he.
Sadly that is the problem with most of Nolan's cinematography. It seems that he makes movies for himself first, ""I want to make a movie I would like to see"" type thing. By trying to communicate very confusing story line we get plenty of expositions through the dialog. Basically characters are sitting around and explain to the audience the plot.
Nolan removed plenty of the over emotionality which he used in ""INTERSTELLAR"" and kept it very emotionally dry.
Considering that this is espionage story we get very little background stories about the characters which limits our emotional attachments as the plot thickens. The protagonist of the story John David Washington (son of Denzel Washington) is credited as exactly the 'Protagonist"". After his success in the ""BlackKlansmen"" Washington seems to be on the row securing lead role in this action blockbuster. Although not as charismatic and physically imposing as his father, John David does a good job of trying to connect with the audience. However to some extant I find his presence not strong enough to carry the movie. The action fight scenes work, but the height difference between him and his potential love interest Elizabeth Debicki is very noticeable and creates romantic disparity which audience can feel. In general all the scenes which forward plot through dialog don't seemed to work very well. That has been a key criticism of Nolan's movies, that he uses too much dialog based exposition and just like in 'INCEPTION"" it can get very confusing specially with the sound mix which puts music and sound FX in foreground making dialog almost inaudible. By keeping the backstory of the main characters to minimum 'T E N E T"" offers type of emotional dryness. Although the stakes are high we don't seem to care much about our characters, because we are not emotionally invested in their struggle.
For this type of movie to work you need powerful antagonist and Kenneth Branagh does not disappoint.
Every scene he is in he is ""chewing"" the scenery but to be 100% honest as Russian impressions go his is good but not great. Russians have this masculine heaviness which is hard to duplicate and I don't talk about the accent because Branagh did well implementing it.
It just that for a man who has nothing to live for he haven't fully inhabit the mafia boss avatar.
Other performances seems solid specially Robert Pattinson although he still lacks bravado and charisma.
Groundbreaking in its concept of time reversal it feels like
T E N E T has been a concept movie.
""Would it be cinematic to revers things in the scene and make things visually impressive? ""
Yes, lets based the whole film on that premise and so Nolan did.
By replacing frequent score collaborator Hans Zimmerman with Ludwig Göransson, Nolan took the emotionality away from the movie and brought a sense of dryness.
Perhaps 'T E N E T"" is Nolan's audition for the next Bond movie.
Considering actions scenes they are done very well and with epic scope without use of green screen mostly captured in camera.
But the action finally of the movie felt disappointing for me, staged as a sort of large scale confusing 'paintball match"" with building and explosions detonating and being reversed in time. All of that looks visually impressive but somehow not truly fulfilling.
T E N E T was shoot using 70mm IMAX camera and I would suggest to see it in IMAX as Nolan intended.
I avoided writing about the key plot spoilers, specially by the end as we are nearing conclusion we are confronted with twists and turns which feels a little forced and confusing. Due to that fact I see the audience having to come for multiple viewings which should enhance the box office.
Perhaps another line from the film is fitting here.
""Try to not understand it, feel it""
Bottom line T E N E T is one of these movies which might gain more acclaim as time passes and who knows perhaps 5 years from now we will truly understand an impact T E N E T had on post pandemic film industry."
2081,"Don't give Nolan money for special effects and travel to exotic locations and maybe he would write a story that make sense.The higher the budget the more ridiculous and convoluted the plot. It's pointless writing explanatory dialogue if no one can hear it. Branagh is wooden, there's no chemistry between Washington and Debicki.
Yawn."
2082,"Two and a half boring hours. Nolan didn't exhaust the actually fascinating idea. So the film remained superficial and predictable - with all the clichés like Manhattan Project. The music was just noise and the actors played like in a B-movie. No irony, no joke, just deadly serious.This is Nolan's first flop and that's an amazing thing after 10 good to outstanding films in a row. But for this reason you don't have to watch Tenet."
2083,"Loved first 10mins Was bored ,confused with sore head for latter 2 hours plus.I go to cinema to be entertained not to get my mind frazzled.Def an over indulged ego trip for Nolan."
2084,"It's the mechanism of the IMAX camera that allows such an insight into an alternate reality; and at the heart of the perplexity and fascination for me, there is the view of the world that can only exist cinematically. Only Nolan can exemplify the true, sheer volume of cinema.Nolan disseminates his mastery of the action genre, catapulted by a science-fiction backbone: there is a sheer desire to bewilder.Rating: *****"
2085,"Watching tenet for the sake of it one time is not doing the justice to the cinema you are about to enjoy. First time watching of tenet will be confusing, loud and mind bending but watching it twice and third time will make you fortunate enough that you gave this masterpiece of cinema a second chance."
2086,"Another brilliant movie from Christopher Nolan. I really loved this one. An excellent theme of perception of time, great actors, great scenes, awesome all together. I am going to watch this movie several times for sure.But the real hero is protagonist John David Washington. This guy is a real killer, what an actor! Make him the new 007! Please!"
2087,"I love Christopher Nolan movies. I love their aesthetic, vehemence, visual grandeur, ambitious plot lines, and overall character development. Tenet has a lot of the signature Nolan ingredients but I was left scratching my head as the storyline is like literally impossible to follow. What the heck was I watching?! This was like as if the German Netflix series Dark had a threeway love child with The Naked Lunch and the Bourne Identity. ?????????? NEXT!"
2088,Just a small distraction from movie means a loss on the track. Though really complex and for the most part jaw dropping. Another masterpiece from Nolan. Kudos to songwriter
2089,"This movie is a rare example of a time travel script that doesn't break its own rules (yes, I'm looking at you, Netflix DARK) in order to come to a closure, it doesn't leave the viewers hanging for an answer on its final scenes (Inception),Instead of over explaining what TENET is, Nolan makes the viewers (and characters) to accept the rules and work with what they have, which makes the movie more interesting.
Nolan doesn't hold your hand guiding you through origins or making sure you won't get lost, the movie happens at its own pace and its the viewers job to keep up with the train of thought.Shout out to John David Washington who feels more like a human being than ""a man with a mission"" type of character, something that has always been missing on Nolan's movies.This is the type of movie for people who likes a challenge, regardless of how many times you'll need to watch it to fully understand the plot."
2090,"Tenet lacked the charisma of a impactful lead in a mind bending but comprehensible feature. It definitely tries to surpass inception but simply couldn't. I expect more from Nolan's casting crew as some characters simply lacked the depth to such a compelling narrative. This is one of those moments when a story is so good but characters simply couldn't add depths to it, for example the way Leonardo or Matthew would. The main character apart and Debicki(Cat) simply fell flat alongwith Andrei. Props to Nolan for such a creative feature. Please Cast better next time."
2091,I dint really understand the entire plot but still gave 10/10 assuming i may understand later and will come back see my rating which i gave that day was correct.
2092,"I've seen the movie more than a week ago but was too lazy and speechless to write anything.
Firstly, most of Tenet is confusing as hell, especially on the first watch so if you can watch the movie at least twice. Some scenes are really fast-paced and would require some pauses but hey, if you went to the cinema you can count that option out. Both Washington and Pattinson do an amazing job throughout the movie and it's always refreshing to see Sir Michael Caine appear on screen. I've seen many comparisons to Inception pre-premier and I would say that it differs in a lot of things. Tenet is much more complex and harder to understand than any of
Nolan's previous works, although I see this as neither a good nor a bad thing. The movie is basically split into two parts or halves and the first section is near impossible to completely understand. As expected in Nolan's films, you get your answer(s) at the end, kind of. The story felt a bit dragged at some places, however the viewer has to pay very close attention through the entire film because if you miss even just 3-5 seconds you're out of the picture. It's like you're forced to be captivated. The last part of the film feels way better as you start to comprehend what has happened in the past hour and half. Most of the movie is practical and includes some really amazing stunts and action that can both please and confuse the viewer even more so.
I feel like Tenet is Christopher Nolan's ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood""; it's a good movie but not what most people would have expected. Definitely not the best I've seen from Mr. Nolan but a solid and enjoyable movie nevertheless."
2093,Amazing movie. Some of the best action set pieces ive ever seen. Enthralling story. You have to pay attention but it is worth it. A theatrical experience similar to inception or the matrix.
2094,"I'd say it's perhaps one of the best work of Mr Nolan. I mean, it's tough to order his films from best to worst as they are all out of this world. Tenet is just another major item to add to that Collection of Masterpiece that he has come up with that no other can. It is confusing if you don't pay attention and yes at times it is hard to hear what the characters are saying. But in the end, the overall experience of Film is Breathtakingly Insane. Watch it twice or more to fully understand, but if you have great attention span, this film is for you. Waiting for his next!"
2095,To fully understand the time concept and to grasp the very complicated timeline second viewing is required. Thankfully it effaced many of my uncertainties or problems in my first screening and impoved the movie by a lot.
2096,"I really wanted to love Tenet. Inception, Interstellar, Memento... I love so many of Nolan's movies and this one promised to be his next great sci-fi blockbuster.
What we get instead is an interesting sci-fi concept wasted in a pretty dull spy thriller. Stolen paintings, super-weapons, arms dealers, plutonium... for the longest time the movie felt like a decaffeinated James Bond movie. An hour in I still wondered when the film was going to turn its focus on it's coolest element (the time-bendy shenanigans from the trailers).
When it does, however, its explanation is muddled in pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo that makes it feel a lot more convoluted than it actually is. Even the set-pieces feel unnecessarily convoluted and not particularly exciting to watch, though that was mainly because I didn't really care for any of the characters.
At least Cobb in Inception or Cooper in Interstellar were relatable human beings with very real problems to overcome. Here, the protagonist doesn't even have a name...
When everything was revealed and the credits rolled, all I could think of was ""meh""."
2097,"I thoroughly enjoyed this amazing, mind-bending masterpiece. It's not as convoluted as some of the other Nolan's film, as long as you comprehend the premise. The twist in the fabric of reality the action is based on is quite straightforward and it all makes sense as long as you buy into the logic he proposes.
But that aside the film is absolutely stunning, the plethora of top class actors are giving their best performances and the music is a vital element of the action, adding a whole new level of experience and meaning to the story.
I can't really say much more without spoiling it but I say this much: listen to the soundtrack and if you enjoy it you'll likely enjoy the film. Personally I cannot wait to buy the base-heavy, sometimes brutal yet lyrical, score and listen it on repeat."
2098,"It was hard to follow on the first view, but I understood enough to know this film was made by a genius far ahead of his time."
2099,"Chris Nolan has done it again!
Great camera work, excellent story and brilliant actors.
Trying to keep up was a challenge.. must watch a 2nd time ;)"
2100,"Although it was difficult to follow from the beginning, nearing the end I was able to comprehend bits and pieces of the movie. Don't feel bad if you didn't get it on the first try, you are not alone.
This movie needs to be watched a few times to really grasp the full extent of its content. Yet again, this is Christopher Nolan for you, the genius behind the genius.
I loved it and I am sure you will love it too."
2101,"All hail to Christopher Nolan, direction and story everything was top class..No doubt its another complex movie from Nolan, maybe you wont understand in first watch but you don't need to rewatch to understand the emotional angle from the movie which nolan movies keep a trademark..And obviously this is one of them but with a unique cinematic experienceSo dont miss out this masterpiece guys"
2102,"Oh... ""Tenet"" .. where to start?... lets go with the plot synopsis first.
The Protagonist (John David Washington) is a counter terrorist agent who uncovers a monumental threat to human existence in the hands of arms dealer, Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh). His investigation gets him close to Sator's wife, Kat (Elizabeth Debicki) who hates her husband and only remains in his life for son they share. Only when he discovers the true nature of the threat, can the Protagonist begin to arrive at even a concept of fighting back.
That doesn't really say much. Essentially it's a Bond film in all but name, but with one high concept idea incorporated. That time for an object can be inversed, so bullets can be pulled out of walls and into a gun and crashed cars will flip back onto its wheels to join a chase - to go further in explanation is to drift into spoiler territory, and I don't want to do that. I can't decide if there's too much going in in ""Tenet"" or not enough. Certainly the first half was a bit of a confusing blur of ""We need to talk to this person about this, and then this person about this, who tells them another name of a person. But that does get better, and you settle into a middle third heist and car chase that is spectacular. Then the final third doesn't really seem to do as much with the concept as you'd hoped it might.
Performances are good. John David Washington has been a star on the rise for a while and although this character isn't much more than a cypher for the audience, he's as compelling as ever. Robert Pattinson is great, I think this might actually be the first film of his I've seen since his Harry Potter supporting role and I'm now eager to see more of the work he's done in between. Kenneth Branagh is fine, but his role is a fairly standard foreign villain stuff - as sadly, is Elizabeth Debicki's role, which might as well been the same character from ""The Night Manager"". The film is, of course, immaculately shot and edited. The score is interesting, all reversed notes that you hear in both directions and it's clear that everything in the film is done practically, or ""in camera"", rather than with CGI. One final negative though, which I had prescribed to the screening that I was in, but I see it in a couple of other reviews here, the sound mix was terrible - some dialogue, particularly from Branagh's character were inaudible. Again - this might be just the cinema I was at, but it was disappointing.
Much like with ""Interstellar"" - I won't for a minute try to argue with you that it's not good, but do I love it. Am I eager to see it again? Not really."
2103,"The film is heavy on concept, but light on plot and character... it paints in broad strokes, though it has plenty of time to develop both. There are whole sequences where they are shooting at an unnamed military that you never see, it doesn't think it's important enough to show that for some reason. That missing element is a good example of a lot of crudely drawn figures that move in and out of the concept, which barrels toward a likely conclusion without much to get in its own way, thus even though the set pieces are BIG, REAL, SHINEY... the action never gets the pulse going and never raises its own stakes or even proves, in raw emotion, it's promised stakes of preventing WWIII. I saw Inception a week before I saw Tenet, of which I'm a big fan of, mostly because it is so much better at reminding us why the fancy effects and large concept *matters* & always bringing it back to Leonardo DiCaprio's obsession with his wife and the rich man's troubled relationship with his father. In Tenet, you don't know much about the two leading males, know and care a bit about the leading female (just enough to make us like them) & the film's villain seems more suitable for a James Bond film than a complicated sci-fi human driven story. Still, with all this, the beautiful look and technical perfection keeps you watching & the concept keeps making you want to thrill to it... similar to Matrix's bullet effect or Nolan's mind-bending Inception... but the film arrives and ends flat, going through motions, without the possibility of being more. It is better than Intersteller in it as far as something actually happens, not as good as Dunkirk as it manages less character than even that film's short vignettes... but it totally misses its own emotional mark and thus all that is left is a brilliantly crafted concept that holds meaning, but without allowing you to enjoy it viscerally as the trailer promises it will. It means more than it actually is. The experience of seeing it is not amazing, not essential movie-going in theaters (at least I could say Dark Knight Rises was an amazing experience even if it didn't meet the heights of the Dark Knight or Batman Begins before it). The film doesn't completely fail and no doubt the concept is mind blowing enough to do it for a large part of the Nolan audience, and I appreciate that part too (which is why my rating is as high as it is), but if a film can't thrill, with all that technical expertise and smart concept, the film in which fails to execute the concept in human terms ultimately fails. 6 outta 10Following: 6 outta 10

2104,"It starts almost boring. But then Nolan walks in and brings all the big guns.
It probably could be better in some moments and sometimes it's too loud.
I was happy it was my first movie after 5 month break."
2105,"Nolan is undoubtedly one of the movie industries great talents, but he produces almost as many misses as he does hits. For every Inception there is an Interstellar. For every Memento there is a Prestige. Sadly, this is a miss. It promises much, and aims high, but falls short of the bar set by Inception. The problem is not in the concept, which is genius, but in the execution, which is clumsy. For long periods, this film is an incomprehensible shambles, the plot is incoherent and the effects are bewildering. Then it reverses direction and begins to explain the previously inexplicable but only some of them. It leaves glaring plot holes scattered liberally throughout the narrative and finishes with an unsatisfying pat on the back. Nolan overreached on this occasion."
2106,"TENET is a good movie related to action and storytelling. Sometimes I had trouble following the story, but later in the film it became clear what happened. Sometimes you also had to take a moment to think again what was happening. I thought all the actors played well but I was only one thing that stood out from the rest and that was the action. After half a year of no big action movies, this was great. All the action scenes were great and it felt really fresh. I give this movie a 9/10 for action, acting, music, story, and storytelling."
2107,"Complex film experience that cleverly expands the narrative standards of cinema and, in addition to the entropy of objects in time, makes a critical commentary on climate change and tells the advocate of independent life. With the help of the spy film genre, Christopher Nolan presents a science fiction thriller that has never been seen before.
.a film that you have to see."
2108,"We have had this before - where the deafening music drowns out the actors voices and detracts from the noise of some otherwise excellent action scenes. The film itself is already very loud but the 'mood' music - which is heavy, droning and very bassy - is the dominating factor throughout. The plot is quite complex and, being unable to her hear most of the actors conversations means much of it is lost. So, not only frustrating to watch but also painful. My ears rang for a good few hours afterwards - and that was after the cinema staff had kindly turned the volume down a tad at my request. Like Interstellar, I will probably enjoy this film a lot more once it is available to watch at home where, for some strange reason, the audio was so much better."
2109,You know what. I don't need to write anything. Just watch it and be amazed! That is all.
2110,"Christopher Nolan manipulates time again. But this time in a more complex way. And it was unlike anything I've ever seenWith an extremely strong plot like usual with Nolan. It's the kind of plot that you'll get the most of during your second watch.Washington and Pattinson had a very good chemistry between them. I enjoyed watching them a lot and I was never boredI only have a small issue with this movie. Which is the lack of character development for the main characters. It mostly affected The Protagonist.I loved Tenet. Some people won't. It wasn't my favorite Nolan movie but it's up there. Overall I give Tenet a 9/10
@Outatime.Movies on Instagram"
2111,Brilliant movie once again Nolan has pulled of new great concept in movie making with anamazing story that put you there in the middle of the movie get you engaged mess with your head go see it definitely a new experience
2112,"Wow, that is to be honest the only word that can describe this movie. I had heard so much about it, from the behind the scenes to all of the info about the actors, so when i went to the cinema i had high hopes. This movie started with immediate action, Nolan draws the attention to the viewer, which i love. Through the first half of the film Christopher Nolan just throws the viewers through the whole storyline. He decides when you get to understand stuff and when you cannot. It's only in the second half that things actually start to make sense, for a lot of people this is not an exciting way of filmmaking because you don't really know what's going on but i would simply say 'ignorance is our munition' because you know so little about the whole story in the beginning you're really getting on the edge of your seat. You couldn't possibly know what was going happen next. And i got the feeling that when The Protagonist fully understood it, so did I. John Washington did the most amazing job, just like Robert Pattinson. The way both of these actors played together was immaculate. I loved every second of the screen time they had together, the slight ominous feeling mixed with a little humour and a small doubt in trust for each other really did it for me. Kenneth Branagh's screenplay was also so good, he is such an amazing actor. Elizabeth Debicki was such a good character, she played her role really well, she was such an intimidating character until she was with her husband, then she would crawl up into this little ball al to protect her son. I could've not suspected anything else from Christopher Nolan but the cinematography was out of this world, the way of filming was so mesmerising, the long moving shots were so beautifully made. The way how the first half was so played in onto the second half was the best part for me personally. You'd look at all these loose ends at the beginning but didn't really pay attention to it because the storyline was so complex, you barely had any time to pay attention to anything else. You feel so stupid because in the second half it all starts to make sense. Him fighting with himself, him driving the car, him being hurt in his arm. Small details that made the movie so much better. I also loved the music, Nolan sometimes uses so little music and other times such barbaric tones, i personally love it. I notice that most of the time in Nolans films he barely uses any music in dramatic moments, such as fighting scenes or emotional ones. It's honestly so much different and i'm here for it. This movie is a masterpiece and i'd definitely watch it again!"
2113,Another director trying to play with time traveling and fail. At least the music and the filming are top notch.
2114,"Just saw the film in cinema on realese date and was quite overwelmed with the complex story. Of course it was very interesting with something so grand and fresh, but the disappointment comes when you realize that the film's overuse of its gimmick stifles the plot. But I think It deserves a rewatch."
2115,"Tenet follows The Protagonist (a clever way to eschew naming the main character and keeping an air of mystery over his identity) as he tries to prevent World War III. There's a secret Cold War going on behind the scenes, and this time instead of being nuclear weaponry, it's time inversion. This is explained in the movie as items having their entropy introverted. Entropy is the concept of things decaying over time. Inverting this means things instead seek structure. Instead of firing a bullet, you catch it. From your perspective, the bullet is acting irrationally; moving backwards through time. But to the bullet, everything else around it is moving backwards. If this was applied to the entire world, it would result in the ultimate Armageddon, and this is what the Protagonist seeks to prevent.Nolan always said that Inception was his Bond movie, but ultimately Inception is just a fancy heist movie that shares little traits with a Bond film. Tenet is Nolan's realisation of that. Tenet is Nolan's real Bond movie. The Protagonist is ex-CIA, declared dead in the opening half hour, and sent on a globe-trotting adventure as he tracks down and infiltrates the source of the time inversions. A large portion of the movie is spent with the Protagonist spying, disguising, and pretending to be other people. Sometimes it feels like one long commercial for high society. The first steps of his investigation have him masquerading as a billionaire, and then a US Ambassador. Every time he gets into a bind, he manages to somehow talk his way out with fake deals, and every now and then some fisticuffs. He has his own Felix Leiter in Neil, as well as his own Bond girl in Kat, the abused wife of the film's villain. There are car chases, gun-fights, and the constant suspense of being double-crossed. Andrei Sator doesn't have a physical ailment as Bond villains usually do, but he's as ruthless and world-dominating as the best of them. Take away the whole time inversion concept, and Tenet is just another spy movie.Tenet is a movie that is hard to follow though, and not the reasons you'd think. The time inversion can get janky as the movie goes on, but it remains fairly easy to keep track of nonetheless. In fact Tenet is hard to follow thanks to holes in the film's narrative. We jump around from one scene to another with very little time to transition. He is declared dead early, given some spiel about passing a test, and told that the word 'Tenet' will unlock many doors for him. Why? Who knows. It's barely touched upon again in the whole movie. I'm still not sure what the relevance of the title even is. I've read that it might be the name of the organisation the Protagonist gets involved with, but I can't recall any evidence that there's even a secret organisation at all. There's also a moment where the Protagonist gets blown up in a backwards car chase, and then appears in a shipping container perfectly fine heading to an unknown destination. The action scene just ends without any transition to the next one. Once the time inversion starts getting cooky, these scene jumps get even more sporadic. We follow the characters going forward, and then they're going backward, and then they're going forward again, but no reason is actually given beforehand. We're left chasing the answers in expository dialogue given after the fact.And talking of the dialogue, you can't hear half of it. This has been a problem at least since The Dark Knight (looking at you Jim Gordon mumbling in the mayor's office), but at least some effort was made in the following four movies to make sure the dialogue isn't completely drowned out by background noise (including Tom Hardy re-recording his lines in a sound booth). The reason this even happens is Nolan wants to immerse you in the experience, so everything's turned up loud. The movie opens with such a loud synth crash that I'm glad I managed to go to the loo beforehand otherwise I'd have had damp underwear for the movie's entire runtime. Then there's gunshots in a narrow hallway that are deafeningly loud. But this is fine because there's no dialogue. Once the Protagonist is picked up on a boat and told about 'Tenet', we've got the sound of the rushing waves to contend with. And then there's all the breathing apparatus that gets in the way and muffles everything, as well as a conversation between Protagonist and Sator where one of them speaks backwards and has to have a translator correct it over the top of the response. That's two voices saying three different things all at the same time, and then because of the time difference between them, the question and answer shtick kind of does but also kind of doesn't make sense? In a movie where the dialogue does most the explaining, it just leaves you lost half the time. I don't know, maybe the missing transitions I previously mentioned actually are there but I just simply couldn't hear them.Okay, but what about the actual time inversion? Yeah, that makes sense, ironically enough. Invert your entropy, and you travel backwards through time. From your perspective you're still moving forwards, but everything else goes backwards. Rain moves upwards, you get sucked from blows of air, cars act weirdly because friction is backwards, oh and you need breathing apparatus because breathing doesn't work as intended when everything's backwards. Even when the movie dials this up to eleven with a final climax involving both backwards and forwards fighters (affectionately dubbed a temporal pincer), everything still kind of makes sense. Rocket launchers on both sides occur simultaneously, hitting the same building, and blowing it up in a slightly different way depending on your perspective. Throw in characters jumping between backwards and forwards entropy in the same scene and it gets really spicy. In true Nolan fashion this does lend itself to some really cool revelations though, including a nice River Song moment, but those I won't spoil.But to me the biggest failing of this movie is how clinical and matter of fact it is. Nolan's movies have been as strong as they are because they take the overloud, immersive spectacle merged with high concept, original ideas, and bring it together with a tight emotional hook. Cobb is haunted by his wife's suicide because she couldn't distinguish between dream and reality, Cooper misses the entire lives of his kids when an hour becomes twenty-five years, the dire situation of Dunkirk is saved by brave civilians going out and making a difference in the name of patriotism, the tragic tale of Harvey Dent who lived long enough to become the villain, or Leonard's constant, unending quest for vengeance against an antagonist who doesn't exist. Hell even Will and Walter sparring off over the difference between killing and murdering. Nolan's usually very good at keeping everything fundamentally to an emotional level, but Tenet is absent of emotion almost entirely. Protagonist is stone-faced from beginning to end, never once amazed by the notion of time inversion, lacks any chemistry at all with his Bond girl, and lacks any personal stakes in the story whatsoever. The most emotionality we get is from Kat's need to get her son back at all costs, but in the face of total Armageddon it almost comes off as whiny and selfish. Yes darling, we know you need to get out of this hateful, abusive marriage and get your son back, but we're kind of trying to prevent the end of all things here. The world doesn't revolve around you.But ultimately, we're told that we don't need to understand what's going on, we just need to feel it. It's hard to feel it in the truest sense thanks to the lack of emotional hook. But goddamn do you feel the suspense, the pumping of your heart as you see a real 747 careen uncontrollably into a warehouse, the struggle for air as you hold your breath along with characters as they struggle to breathe. Nolan sure as hell has massive action setpieces down to a fine art at this point. It doesn't matter if it's a shootout in an opera house, or wedging an armoured truck in with a fire engine, or a fistfight with someone in a different timeline altogether. We feel every punch, every gunshot, every dramatic blam of the music.I'm not going to lie, I'm a little disappointed in Tenet on a first viewing. Expectations ruin everything, but Nolan has consistently been making some of my favourite movies for over a decade. Tenet feels like another Dark Knight Rises, where all the ingredients are there, but they fail to mesh together in quite the same way as the rest of his movies. With no emotional hook, dialogue drowned out by bad sound mixing, and rushed editing, Tenet feels unusually amateurish or generic at times. It remains enjoyable by the merit of its concept and action sequences, but misses that little extra that makes Nolan movies as truly immersive as they usually are. I give Tenet a 7/10, which wouldn't be bad coming from any other director. It's certainly not Nolan's worst movie, but it's down there. No doubt Tenet is another that just requires multiple viewings in an environment where I can control the volume myself to reach maximum enjoyment."
2116,"No messing around straight in and gets you instantly thinking, fantastic film with a great flow and some excellent performances."
2117,"Lots of twists, really good acting, astounding action sequences, great soundtrack, typical Nolan complexity... What do I want more and could ask for in a film? Nothing, to be honest. If I had to compare it, then it would be most to Inception, except Tenet is a tiny bit less coherent in what it wants. But this means it is still truely awesome, and you should definately see it (...in theatres). Tenet left me mindblown, and in some scenes on the edge of my seat. I think this is Nolans film, where he forces to focus the audience the most, and this is a good thing! Be prepared from the start, and keep up. Look on every detail, to not only feel it, but understand it a little. The movie made me ask myself questions about the future, and the hint about the true dystopian dangers such as climate change was brilliant. About 150 minutes long, not one of them is unnecessary or boring. I really could go on and on and praise this movie for what and how it was. WOW WOW WOW!! An awesome globetrotting action-spy Thriller with some Sci Fi Elements for the first half, until it gets more and more Nolan-typical the longer it goes... which is truely great!"
2118,"3 hours since I saw Tenet and my head is still in a spin.I wasn't a great fan of Inception which this film has been compared to. In my opinion Tenet offers so much more.Sure the plot requires a great deal of attention, but the rewards are there.It definitely warrants a second viewing and if you like this film I'd imagine you'd definitely want to see ii again as there is so much more in the Tenet plot than you could possibly follow in a single viewing. In that respect Nolan may well have saved Cinemas."
2119,I wouldn't change anything in this movie. Its just pure perfection
2120,"Nolan takes up his concept of time and distorts it, giving the viewer an incredible vision.The script is excellent, the direction is superb and the performers are all in their part very convincingly.The use of a few special effects increases the realism of the film and the plot of the film unravels, giving the viewer yet another twist and another Nolan masterpiece."
2121,"A pure mindfuck, but a very spectacular movie !!
This movie will not only save the world ;) but also the cinemas :D"
2122,"Ignore the paid hyping on this film because this film is the worst film ever done by Nolan. It fails on every single film aspect:
Music is hammering, stressing and does not blend along the action depicted. It's completely off track.
Main character is portrayed by the worst actor I ever seen: dull, inexpressive, barely understood when speaking, lack of tone... you can't buy it.
The plot lacks originality everywhere and exudes nonsense: you see it coming miles away. It's just 2 snakes coiling each other. It just feels like a damn video game.
Regrettable deeply!"
2123,"I had no expectations at all but it's bad.
I was just waiting for the movie to end after the first 20 mins.
Bad plot, void acting, B grade movie."
2124,"I honestly don't get the good reviews this movie gets.
Christopher Nolan takes pseudo-scientific talk to hide plot holes to the next level.
Robert Pattinson did not age well."
2125,"Its film score is clunky and metallic, which distorts a lot of the dialogue, meaning there is a lot you cannot really hearThe core concepts of the films' mechanics (how the future is attacking us with bullets that go backwards, being the main one) are explained in such a lazy way - think Clémence Poésy's listless chat, Michael Caine's steak and chips, and the Protagonist's 'passing the test' as just a few examples (I haven't the energy to go in to Kenneth Branagh's catalogue of poorly conceived ideas)When you add to that, John David Washington is muzzled and kept on a leash, it leaves us with Pattinson's scarf-laden efforts as the only real acting-based distraction - and that is really saying something!With such a weary tone to the movie, it feels like Nolan put a backwards-sailing cargo-ship-load-of-money into the action, to try and distract us and make us believe it's actually a good action movie. However, despite the cool backwards chronology and generally well-delivered action sequences, they are not enough to save Tenet from its poor writing or its atrocious deliveryA palindrome it may be, but it does not mean you will want to watch it twice! I fell asleep, and have to admit, there was little about it to make me wonder why I bothered going..."
2126,Tenet was a totally disappointment. Didn't know the start till the end what was happening. Lucky I didn't have to spend a lot on the ticket to watch this since I got a cheap deal but I gave 3 stars for the Sound effects. Other than that the whole movie is a disappointment for me.
2127,"A movie that is truly not worth watching, so confusing and so incomprehensible. 120 minutes of wasted time despite my effort to try to see it through, hopping it might turn out to be hiding its gems to the last scene, but alas, no."
2128,"At first I was a bit skeptical because everyone always said you had to watch the film at least 2 times to follow the plot. But you could follow the plot very well. Unfortunately, I only have two questions left, but I hope that they will be answered in the second part. Otherwise the action scenes are very well done and exciting. I hope that Brolan (my Bro Nolan) takes the opportunity to turn a second part if possible."
2129,"Nolan is using the wrong genre. He needs - as he always does - a drama or action-drama to establish his complicated theme's properly. A drama has a slower paste, which gives the viewer the opportunity to follow the difficult theories he wants to discuss and get familiar with them to enjoy the story. It's about information-provision.
Nolan does that very well in Inception and Interstellar. He uses various tricks for this, so that the information provision is in balance. But with Tenet he chooses action and action, my goodness, it is! Problem: as a viewer I am not carefully introduced into a world that I do not understand, but I am immersed in it in the first 20 minutes and I have to believe the arena he wants me to, without understanding it.
My brain boils over and it stays that way for the rest of the movie; I do not get it. Mission failed.Secondly, the theme - the relativity of time (and space) - is not reflected in the very framework of the script. I just get a linear story (which is a curse in a film over the relativity of time, right?:-))). But worse, the story is an ordinairy Hollywood-formula, hence predictable and cliché (hero finds problem and goes from A to B to C through various action sequences and then we go into the belly of the beast with a lot of guns). Consequence? Tenet is a B-movie with just some unclear circumstances that don't affect my understanding.This is rounded off by my third point of criticism: the acting is mediocre and the bad guy - Sator -, like his wife, is not worked out clearly in the script at all; i don't see clear needs and aim's. Besides, what is suggested as an extremely mysterious figure - for which our hero even has to bungee jump to get through - suddenly turns out to be a sad man on a boat and a suicidal tendency. At the very end, he also babbles something about his concern for the climate. People from the future choose, of all there is of living creatures......him????? Come on, Christoffer! Sator is a joke - with joke-rhetoric . His character is supposed to be the gateway to a mystery. With a joker like that the mystery is a joke too.Tenet is unworthy of Nolan and hopefully his only blunder. But everyone - especially a talent like Nolan - is entitled to a slip."
2130,"I have to say sorry but I was disappointed midway through the film. The dialogue is just not on par, sometimes seems even sloppily concocted. But my main gripe is the story and physics. Mentioning the Grandfather Paradox and the mambo jumbo about positrons moving back in time is hardly subtle science to make us believe it's real science. It is all too simplistic, nothing original. The ""inverted"" individuals that run ""conveniently"" backwards, is just plain lazy story telling. We've seen by now thousands of clips run backwards and they don't fools us anymore that ""THAT"" is how time runs backwards.
I was expecting a more imaginative way to show that."
2131,"This is another absolute masterpiece from Nolan!All you heard is probably true. This is an alternate dimensions story, playing with time, with outstanding characters and exceptional music to go with it.
I can't explain it if I tried... And its understanding will probably hinge on 30 seconds in the dead center of the movie (literally the mid point in the mid third of the movie). Miss it, and you'll need a second, maybe even a third watch.
Nolan is as always a mad genius... Washington is keeping on cementing his presence in the industry and Pattinson is a calm, consistent pillar to the movie! Debicki provided that emotional weight to the story brilliantly and Branagh is a solid villain.
Music is one of the best aspects of the movie and the cinematography/effects deserve an Oscar unequivocally.
This is a must see! And expect being a little lost. But once you're ""found"" it will be the most supreme feeling ever!"
2132,"A amazing movie again from the legend Christopher Nolan. For sure a head scratcher, when you put the pieces together it makes that worth wile. Amazing scenes. Amazing cast. Beautiful ending."
2133,"This film was originally intended to be released in mid-July 2020, but was delayed to 31 July, until finally being released in August, this is due to the COVID-19 pandemic causing all cinemas to close during the lockdown. I saw the five minute footage trailer back in March, and I was most interested to see it on the big screen, so thank goodness cinemas eventually reopened (with guidelines and safety measures), and I went to see this. The dictionary definition of ""tenet"" is ""any opinion, principle, doctrine, dogma, etc., especially one held as true by members of a profession, group, or movement"", I just knew it was a blockbuster that loads of people, including me, were keen to see, written and directed by Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia, The Dark Knight, Inception, Dunkirk). Basically, an unnamed Protagonist (John David Washington, Denzel's son), a CIA agent posing as a Ukrainian policeman, participates in an undercover Russian operation to steal an unidentified object during a terrorist siege on an opera house in Kyiv. During the chaos, the Protagonist is saved by a masked gunman using time-reversing technology. The Russians turn on the CIA members and torture the Protagonist, but he bites a suicide pill before to avoid revealing any information. The Protagonist wakes, learning that the pill was fake, and that all his team members were caught and killed by the Russians, and they have got the unidentified object. The Protagonist is recruited into a secret organisation seeking to track down the origin of ""inverted"" objects, which move backward through time, using future technology sent back into the past. Investigating inverted bullets, the Protagonist is assisted by Neil (Robert Pattinson) to infiltrate the compound of an arms dealer, Priya (Dimple Kapadia). She directs them towards Russian oligarch Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh). To reach Sator, the Protagonist approaches Sator's wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki). The Protagonist experiences the inverted technology during an operation, involving a plane crashed the storage facility in Oslo Airport, where he fights a regular masked man. Neil unmasks and releases his opponent, then stops the Protagonist from killing the inverted opponent, who escapes. Priya explains that the facility contained a time inversion device. Kat arranges for the Protagonist to meet Sator, who the Protagonist saves Sator from Kat's murder attempt. Sator reveals that information sent from the future had contributed to his wealth. The Protagonist offers to steal the object that Sator had been seeking, in exchange that Kat will be freed. After the Protagonist and Neil steal the object from an armoured car in transport, an inverted Sator confronts them, holding Kat hostage to obtain the object. Neil calls in the secret organisation's time-inverting troops to assist. Time inversion devices are used by Sator and the Protagonist and they battle for possession of the object, with Sator ultimately prevailing; and Kat is severely wounded with an inverted bullet. To save Kat from death, the Protagonist and Neil join her in inverted time, but they require the device in Oslo Airport to un-invert in the past. They infiltrate the airport, using the plane crash as a distraction: the masked man the Protagonist previously encountered was actually his future self. The un-inversion is successful. Priya explains that the crucial object is part of a future-developed ""algorithm"" capable of catastrophically inverting the entire world. The algorithm was sent into the past to prevent its use in the future, leading to human extinction from climate change. Kat reveals Sator's motive: he is dying from inoperable cancer and believes that the world should die with him. Sator has the algorithm and travels to a time in the past when he was most happy, where he plans to die peacefully and activate the algorithm. He is followed by Kat and the time-inverting secret organisation. Kat will delay Sator's death in Vietnam, while troops attack a Soviet closed city to retrieve the algorithm. Kat kills Sator prematurely, but the Protagonist and Neil retrieve the algorithm in time. During the retrieval, the Protagonist is saved by a masked corpse who springs back to life inverted. The organisation plans to separately hide the algorithm's components. As Neil and the Protagonist part ways, Neil reminisces about their long partnership, revealing that the future version of the Protagonist had recruited Neil in Neil's past. The Protagonist notices that Neil has a red string on his backpack, like that who saved him in the opera house. Neil insists he must continue his mission, intending to invert time. In London, Priya attempts to kill Kat to tie up loose ends. Instead, the Protagonist kills Priya, and implies that a future version of himself will be the mastermind behind all of the secret organisation's actions. Also starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Ives, Himesh Patel as Mahir, Michael Caine as Michael Crosby, and Fiona Dourif (Brad's daughter) as Wheeler. Washington is reasonable as the lead, Pattinson is fine, Branagh is suitably hammy as the villain, and there is almost point in Caine being in the film, being in a single and very short scene. A character asks, ""Does your head hurt yet?"" to another, that is exactly the feeling you are going have watching this film. You cannot deny that the special effects, editing, and sound design are fantastic to make spectacular scenes with explosions, gunfire and crashes seen reversing and going forward, sometimes in the same scene. The problem is, it is pretty much impossible to try and work out what the hell is going on, it is trying to be too clever that it almost forgets about the audience watching. It's not quite what I had in mind as the first film to watch returning to the cinema, lol. I really wanted to follow and understand it, but it is just too confusing, I admit that I fell asleep at one point, a visually fantastic but mind-boggling science-fiction action thriller. Okay, in my opinion!"
2134,"I know that every Nolan Movie is considered a unique experience but out of all those experiences this movie is the most unique ;)
I just watched it once and was able to understand most of it- had to google 1 or 2 things at the end to understand everything - will definitely go in a second time because you will see the first part of the movie from a whole new perspective when you watch it for a second time.
The story is complex without appearing inlogical.The actors do their best!
Why did I only gave it a 9/10?
For me there is a lack of emotion in this movie . I don't feel emotionally connected to any of the characters in the movie. Thankfully the whole story is entertaining enough, so that's nothing that you will really miss because the story is entertaining enough .Watch it, you won't regret it- support your local cinema:)"
2135,"This masterpiece of Nolan with a great cinematography, great soundtrack, great visuals, great everything. A puzzling movie more like Memento will be hard to understand it even after revealing the answers there will always be a question of how? And Wait what?. Though the noises from the movie were too loud at some point loud action soundtracks, heavy drums, but maybe it's just me, my mind was very confused and tired after the movie trying to figure out the story. Overall it is exactly what you expect from a Nolan movie.
The movie starts with point A-B-C-D and then it switches back from point D-C-B-A, it starts with a tense sequence makes you think it's an action movie with gun shooting and terrorists and then the protagonist starts a mission to save the world and prevent world war 3 it will make you wonder what the hell is going on, through all the movie sequences and scenes you'll see situations where you still can't figure out what's happening until you reach point D where you'll find out the very interesting time travel. If you've seen time travel movies you might get an idea on how things work and the grandfather paradox.
Now explaining the plot and the idea of the movie:
Before reaching point D you'll see things happening before it happened like 3 gunshots already been shot in the window and then the guy who shot them shows up to take back those bullets to his gun and fights the protagonist (backwards). After you reach point D and find out about the time travel the protagonist will then enters the future and see the whole world going backwards, he will pass by all the sequences at points C,B and A. The protagonist will find himself in the same spots as his past self was, like the guy who shot the 3 bullets In the window and fought the protagonist in the beginning before point D, that's right it's the protagonist fighting himself in the past."
2136,Quite likely im gonna watch it again. BUt meanwhile I have to say its amazing.
2137,"If anyone can make sense of what is actually going on with this film, I doff my cap to you.Completely unfathomable film, what is the point?By way of example as to how ridiculous this film is, the scene where the security van is boxed in by the trucks. Why is it only when they are rammed do the security guards (or were they police), decide to use their radios? Surely you'd be a tad suspicious if you're being surrounded by at 3 trucks out of no where.Rubbish"
2138,"I went to see it last night with my wife and i must say this is one of the most complex and mindbending experiences ive ever had.
Dont go in expecting some easy movie full of exposition, you wont get it here. You get a smart , very intelligent movie , where u must pay attention at every thing, if not, the ending of the movie will make it easy on you.
Go see it in the theaters, dont wait for Blu Ray or streaming, this is an experience that u must have it on the big screen , it is totally worth the price of the ticket and its thanks to directors like Nolan that i love this art so much."
2139,"It makes sense that a movie with a palindrome for a title requires two viewings to fully make sense of it. My only concern was the need for subtitles, as in IMAX it is difficult to make out some of the dialogue.I'm certain most people didn't understand Inception or Interstellar on the first viewing, this just takes it up a notch but should stand the test of time in a similar way."
2140,"Been following Nolan's work since ""the following "". Inception and Memento were his best work and Tenet is right up there.
Was one of the first in the world to watch it on early screenings here in Australia. Background score was bit too loud in volume levels as compared to the dialogues. A lot of dialogues were hard to understand, especially the scenes where characters had oxygen masks on. Ludwig definitely needs some mixing skills from the great Hans Zimmer.
Its surely a visual spectacle, 5 times more jaw dropping scenes then Inception. Amazing work and detail by Nolan. I know lot of people didnt like the fact that there was no character back story of any of the characters except Elizabeth & Kenneth's character but I didnt mind it.
I am going to watch it again this week to try and understand the remaining 20%."
2141,This movie is 2 hours of pure art! I enjoyed so much!
2142,I have to watch this movie several times over to find the hidden easter eggs that I kind of missed watching it the first time. I love the action scenes & the way they can go back in time to things this missed & fix. I think I will continue to watch this movie for many years or decades to come.
2143,"I only watched it one time, but when I left the cinema with my mate everything about the whole movie just made sense. I understood a big part of the film. Cristopher Nolan did a freaking amazing job with this film! I get why you have to watch it twice because it is complicated."
2144,"Amazing
Loved it
Masterpiece already watch two times
Nolan is a genious"
2145,Far too loud and couldn't understand the dialog. Definitely not Nolans best work.
2146,"There have only be a few movies that were able to do time travel right, one was Momentum and the other Edge of Tomorrow. Tenet wasn't as interesting as it should have been. The cast was good and of course because it was the Inception director the visuals were seizure inducing. But, the plot and dialog was dull and boring. I had most of the answers before the movie was halfway into its plot. You know you're in trouble when you start checking your watch to see when this movie will be over. Only Neil was an interesting character. I got tired of emphasis on certain characters instead of on the plot to destroy the world.
Note to directors, just making a movie complicated doesn't make it interesting. I should have given it a 4 but I gave it a 6 because John David was good and I didn't get upset seeing Pattison (which I usually do)."
2147,Most confusing C.Nolan movie ever. Was lost within 15 minutes. Thought Robert Paterson did great... makes me think he can pull off Batman. Denzel's son not as much.
2148,A good movie.A complex movie but It just complex for the sake of complex.And the story line is not interesting enough.And the main character for me is not likeable
2149,"Considering the budget involved with making a movie like this, I don't know why it has such bad mixing. Couldn't they have gotten someone who knows what they did? I'd probably like it if I knew what they were saying."
2150,"I had great hopes for this having seen the trailer but oh my god did it not deliver. Backwards and forwards time skipping and complicated plot points left me cold. The backwards marching soldiers were only missing a Benny Hill soundtrack. Brannaghs Russian accent although terrible was not the worst acting in the film. That award was given to he of the floppy fringe, Robert Pattinson, he could have been replaced with a wooden spoon and not been missed. I still haven't forgiven him for sparkly vampires. Avoid"
2151,"Impressive screenplay but falls flat under any analysis. I am not even going to talk about time travel which is paradoxical and stupid. He might say that he avoided causality problems. But no he did not! But again that is not my problem with it. Fiction can force unrealistic ideas to use as artists tool for some bigger idea. And what was the idea here? Exactly! Nolans goal was clearly to write mind bending script instead of creating a good movie. He does not bring any ideas or amazing characters. it's just OCD filmmaker movie. Average camera. Poor music score. Good actors with pointlessly twisted but essential stupid script. It is very much like Bond or Who-done-it movie. Fun, unless you use any amount of critical thinking. And there are huge problems with Neil character and smaller goofs that conflict internal logic. So, movie just rotates around paradoxical concept and goes nowhere. No impressive characters, no music , story is just for the sake of story with stuff just thrown there."
2152,Too long and too complex for a single movie. Ready to leave at least a half hour before end.
2153,"An amazing soundtrack, stunning visuals and a brain twisting story. Recommend to watch with subtitles since the music is so loud that it could be hard to understand what they are saying at times. This was the best experience I've ever had watching a movie."
2154,This movie is a master piece sure there are a few parts where you are trying to figure out was is happening or in this case what has happened. But it checks off many boxes for me. I would say it is one of my favorite Nolan films. It is a cinamatic experience I will be back to see again and again. Also the score by Ludwig Goransson is one of my favorite film scores to date. Thank you Christopher Nolan
2155,"Act 1 - 8.2Act 2 - 7.7Act 3 - 8.3
A spy thriller that manipulates timeAction is fantastic and complex with the way time works in the filmActing is all very goodEditing is fantastic as so much of the film relies on itScore is greatDialogue is very good but the audio was sometimes drown out by the backgroundOpening of the film instantly engages you with swift actionAction scenes in the art warehouse are so smart and awesome to watchWhen they manipulate time the world is the same for everybody else but you are in reverse with some other challenges tooGet the general idea of how they work with time in the film but to get it on a step by step explanation is very hard to follow and I don't think Nolan wants us to understand everything anywayCharacters are left with questions and we do get some answers but as it is in the spy world many keep things close to the chestEnd of the film learning that the protagonist as he is called was in charge of recruiting himself and everybody else is pretty awesomeThe protagonist had his future self helping him save the world in our present time, cool realizationA lot of third act reveals that make sense as our characters interact with themselvesSo many intricate scenes that work so well with the time manipulation but can be hard to follow at timesVery smart film that would help from multiple views to try and catch and understand everythingStrong recommendation."
2156,"The premise of this movie is fascinating and left me and my husband discussing it for a good hour. Would definitely recommend time buffs to see. I would have rated it 7/10 if not for the poor acting by Washington. His unchanging facial expression and monotonous delivery made the movie drag on. Patterson's performance gave the movie some much needed energy.I honestly think a better leading man would have made the movie more interesting and understandable. There was a lot of information given to you and a lot of things only partially explained. While I think a lot of that had to do with the whole concept of time and was done on purpose, it did make the movie confusing. . . For example the difference between those that are inverted verses just jumping through time."
2157,"I believe JDW was made to be in a Christopher Nolan movies like he screams Christopher Nolan movies, you know what I mean like how Ryan Reynolds was made to be Deadpool or like how if you think action movies you think Tom Cruise or Charlize Theron that's why when you think Nolan movie you think John David Washington he has it all to be a Nolan actor, the looks the body, the physicality, the charisma, the heart eveything! Nolan could not have picked a better actor to play this character, no one could have done the character justice like JDW and the fact that JDW screams Nolan movie that he's the embodiment of Nolan movie is also pretty cool like imagine finding the human personified of Nolan movies! He's awesome the man just so cool and mind blowing like a Nolan movie! I just love it and him"
2158,If your a fan of inception and the The Prestige you will love this film! Chris Nolan did it again a great cast. Denzel Washington's son is following in his father's footsteps 👣.
2159,"I wanted to enjoy the movie, but the theater I attended had several difficulties leading to interruptions. Sound levels were too low for the first third of the movie, so actor's dialogues were inaudible. The physics reversal of time special effects were so arbitrary to be unbelievable. A disappointing viewing."
2160,"This was definitely Nolan's most complex movie. I don't think it was the most emotional movie he's done, but tenet definitely takes cinematography and storytelling to another level that I don't think any film maker has dared to attempt. I heard this was his take on a James Bond type film so if you enjoy the action of a bond movie, and complex storytelling of inception and interstellar then you will love this movie. I will say though that you will definitely need to watch this a few times to fully grasp the story and what it all means"
2161,"An advice - don't expect an overflow of emotion, character development and drama. This movie is really designed for hard core Nolan fans who enjoy great visual pieces and mind bending puzzles. It is a 2 1/2 hour fast past thrill ride. If you want emotion and drama - go watch Titanic."
2162,"Christopher Nolan again show us how good he is at building context. The movie base on a scifi theory and he build the whole world around this theory in detail.
In the early minutes of the film, there is some weird and random event happen make it was pretty hard to follow, even characters in the movie dont understand what is happening. But when we finish the movie, every piece of the puzzle is filled and reveal the big picture. Logic and whole. the acting is also great.
It is really please to watch"
2163,"You must watch Tenet. Christopher Nolan's time bending master piece. Never before seen on tv, time inversion. All you need is to lose focus for 10 seconds and you will yourself scrambling to catch up. It's like 2hrs of constant puzzle solving. Thoroughly enjoyed it and I have to watch it two more times to truly get it in all it's beautify of film making. Extraordinary performances by John David Washington and Robert Pattison. The star power of the two is extreme subtle and they allow the story line to take centre stage. You are so focussed trying to figure out what time you are in you don't have time to enjoy synergy of the two characters but you notice it with time. Now back to this totally new time travelling concept. You can't go back to a specific time, rather you live it in reverse and then the mind boggling moments when you are like: ""omg! That's what was happening"" . Oh you will learn what entropy measurement is a way of distinguishing the past from the future and so many cool concepts. A must watch!"
2164,"Another Christopher Nolan masterpiece, After such a long wait tonget back to the cinema, Tenet reminded me why I missed it so much! Huge set pieces with more ingenuity that most other entire movies can muster. I won't go into any plot details as it's something everyone should see for themselves but the cast is fantastic with zero weak links, John David Washington is a legit superstar in waiting! The final third of the movie will leave you breathless... see it on the biggest screen possible!!"
2165,"If you like movies that have a easy-rewatch-edge to them, you're in for a treat.I must admit, the first time I watched the movie I had difficulty wrapping my head around some of the main concepts and themes in the movie. Thus, I decided to just let the movie take me in for the ride and enjoy the visuals and soundtracks, and believe me, on that front it will easily suffice as well. Göransson did a wonderful job on the soundtrack and I was curious how they would implement the track produced by Hip Hop artist Travis Scott but this was done great as well.After a second and third rewatch I now realize I had it easy with something like Inception thinking that was complicated. All I can say is that I truly appreciate directors like Nolan willing to take complex stories as these and risk them on a huge budget. A large percentage of initial viewers will leave the cinema frustrated not understanding many parts of the films. Movie buffs however, will love it and will enjoy their second rewatch even more.
Last, my compliments go out to the cast, especially Washington who played a very convincing protagonist. Pattinson as well as supporting actor had great presence in his scenes without taking too much away from Washington.
For me, this movie is a 10. If you can keep me as engaged on the third rewatch as the first you have done something very special. Congratulations Nolan."
2166,Christopher Nolan does it again. Robert Pattinson and David Washington were great in the movie. Elizabeth Debeki also did great. Overall a good thriller movie.
2167,"Mind bending themes, stunning visuals, exceptional pacing and superb soundtrack. Standard issue Nolan who in my opinion is the top director of the current movie industry. The two and a half hour run time flies by such is the ride this movie takes you on."
2168,"Absolutely stunning performances, Story and cinematography That's all I have to say."
2169,"Time travel has been done many times, but Nolan manages to do it in a way that is new, creative, exiting and sometimes a little hard to follow. I don't want to spoil the story. So lets just say; It will give you plenty to talk/debate about and you really need to pay attention to details if you want to get this movie on the first viewing. A little warning: Compared to Inception its a lot less linear and harder to follow.The fast paced action and the great acting form all the main characters (Even from Robert Pattinson, who came a long way since that vampire disaster) made this a very enjoyable movie. The only downside was that the movie is a bit too long and because of this and the 'reverse time thing' the second halve had more trouble keeping my attention than the first. Additionally the final battle had way too much going on, even a movie nerd like me couldn't keep up with everything. (Although that does give me a reason to watch it again... :)The science of this new idea also has quite a few issues, even if you accept this unexplained technology, the movie only seems to follow its own rules to the level that it helps the story. Personally I think its important that a Science fiction movie follows its own rules, but I guess such a complex issue like this allows for a few short cuts and paradoxes. At least, the timeline does make sense and if you pay attention there are plenty off hints that will let you figure things out before the big reveal. If your interested in a clever action sci-fi you should definitely go see Tenet."
2170,"Spolier-free-The goods:
Action is superbly filmed and the soundtrack is tensed.Acting and direction are awesome.The time inversion is a great ideaThe first half of the movie is mindblowingThe bads:
It can be hard to follow sometimesThe moral of the story is sort of oddOverall:
8.0"
2171,"So finally Tenet,the one of most antipicited films of a year finally come to a screen.So how was it,well it was very good even great in some aspects.Acting is one of best i seen from entire year,characters are brilliantly written and they had a lot of personality and good arcs,script was also written in such a way that it will have many people queting it in a future,entire look of a film,colors and the way how it was filmed was brilliant,action scenes are done in a very good way,not on level of Inception but still very good.The way how Nolan combined two completly different styles of filming i mean normal one and backward one were done in a amazing way,direction was again great and it leaded story forward.I will give this film soon another rewatch to see some things little better and clearer and maybe i will like it even more"
2172,"First big release since the outbreak, guess Christopher Nolan hit it out of the park again.. Tenet nothing short of a spectacular show, a mind bending, espionage-thriller ride(seamlessly 2 and half hours)3reasons to watch: Nolan filmmaking, Hoyte Van Hoytema visuals, Ludwig Goranson background score!Brilliant casting: John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Anthony Taylor, Elizabeth, Kenneth, Dimple Kapadia all well played! Stunning action blocks and visuals, with the amazing score (Hans Zimmer vibes) and that Boeing blast part was little dramatic.. IMAX is a must!"
2173,"I just got home after seeing this movie and first I must say that I LOVE Christopher Nolan, I really do! But i really feel like this was a backlash for him.
Yes it has an incredible story, and yes it was visually a damn masterpiece. But I am sad to say that this is a movie with a lot of ""plot holes"" and a rushed script.
Nothing feels natural or smooth, and I felt like it was to predictable.
I get the feeling that this movie was made to be a hugh
Financial success and not made for being a mind twisting cinema experience, like Inception, Memento or Interstellar.
It really hurt me deeply to say that this didn't live up to my expectations.*Not a bad movie!!. Just not Nolan's best.*** English is not my main language, so sorry if there's some mistakes**"
2174,"This was ABSOLUTELY one of the WORST movies I've EVER seen..... as bad as Will Ferrell's Sherlock Holmes. I will never get that $36 or 2 1/2 hours back. Bad acting, bad writing, bad sound editing - muffled voices . The ONLY positive: the yacht was nice. It is a good thing Kenneth Branagh has never won an Oscar because after this movie they would demand it back."
2175,"The protagonist(John David Washington, a great lead) is recruited to stop a major threat. I won't reveal more detail than that. Thankfully, he won't have to face it alone. He'll be working with Neil(Robert Pattinson, all charm and wit). Hypothetically, if he had other allies, I would not give away here who they are. I won't reveal the exact nature of the role of Kat(Elizabeth Debicki, somehow matching her work in Widows. Covering a lot of the emotional spectrum). But I will say that, if I didn't love everything about this(don't get me wrong, I absolutely do), honestly, even if, in fact, I *hated* every single other thing about this movie, it would still be worth watching for her performance and presence alone. They are up against a formidable threat: Sator(Kenneth Branagh, very sinister). Can they possibly save the world?The director continues to master spy movies. In some ways this is James Bond with a mindbending sci-fi twist. Nolan has returned to the heights of quality of The Prestige, The Dark Knight and Inception. It has the best and biggest action set pieces of his career, and it's the most visually compelling. Even for him, this is incredibly complex. It won't be enough to pay close attention and try carefully to figure everything out while watching. You'll have to go over everything afterwards. It may take multiple viewings. I won't claim I understand everything in this yet.This pushes the PG-13 rating, and contains a lot of exploration of abuse, some deeply disturbing violence(even though it is more hinted at than clearly shown), and a little bit of strong language. I recommend this to every fan of anyone working on this, with the obvious caveat that I would not want for anyone who fears for their safety in a theatre due to Covid to risk harm to themselves or those around them. 10/10"
2176,"Been a fan of Nolan since Memento and I gotta say, Tenet takes him to a whole new level.I don't know why people kept saying you need to watch this multiple times, I got a hold of the whole things from the get go. But if you're not the kind to focus while watching movie, maybe you'll miss something somewhere. But frankly, it's a complex and layered Terminator presented in the way only Nolan can do.Watch it, scrutinise it and get ready to be blown away. Just don't get lost in the details and hints being put throughout the movie."
2177,"Is this movie confusing? Yes
Did I understand everything? Hell no
Do I have to rewatch it? ProbablyBut don't believe the terrible critics. This movie is anything except lame and boring.
Acting is good, plot is mind blowing, confusing and intriguing. A good watch overall."
2178,This is my first movie review ever and i'm gng all in this. And yes Tenet (2020) is the best Christopher Edward Nolan movie ever and in the coming 10 to 20 years this movie will be branded as one of the greatest ever.
2179,"After paying attention or watching twice, If still don't like it you're just dumb."
2180,"This movie is just as awful as 2020 has been for everyone. It's a big waste of time and money. I got a headache watching everything backwards and it was annoying and very distracting to be able to follow the story line. The long combat scene that was done in call of duty format was the worst because the whole thing is in reverse and that will for sure give you a headache, it was like the director wanted to torture the audience. by far the worst movie I have watched this year."
2181,Unpopular opinion: Tenet is boring and not that complicated as people say
2182,"This is Christopher Nolan's masterpiece. People have been complaining like it's too complicated, had to watch 2-3 times, didn't end well but I guess people are stupid and they find flaws everywhere. If you like to enjoy movie with suspense, thriller, action, mind bending like you actually have to use a brain to understand not like explained/Dumb down for you at the end then this is a great movie. This movie should be nominated for Oscars, if that won't happen then people at Oscars are so Dumb that they couldn't understand the movie. Especially the year is getting crappy and crappy, I'd say this is the only good thing happened in 2020"
2183,"The very glaring problems like no emotional depth or poor sound design are already mentioned in many reviews.
Editing were poor at some places and excellent at others. There is a scene where it feels body language wise that Protagonist is about to talk but it is cut immediately to something else. Naming the protagonist protagonist is downright lazy. Main actor Protagonist I didn't feel the acting convincing. Also the music is used even at places unnecessary. Music feels a bit monotonous as I felt no elevations or depressions. The Sci fi elements aren't fascinating. Dreams and time travel etc are fascinating. But this is something totally alien. Story feels artificial on many levels which I can't pin point exactly. Why does the Protagonist trust Neil from the beginning is also perplexing. The suspense in the movies were lot more predictable than Nolan's other movies. The fight with the masked man was predictable as the reason he weears mask is because audience knows the identity of the character. Neil was either an enemy or friend from future was also predictable. I would never watch this film again because films should never be watched again except in our own minds. Choosing of locations felt like James Bond movies , glamour for glamours sake."
2184,"This is a solid Nolan film but gotta be honest it is not my favorite of his. The technical aspects of this film are all great, whether it is the acting, cinematography, and direction but I was lost for most of this film. It might have just been me but I literally had to google things to find the answer and figure out how inversion works and what exactly was going on. Once I did figure out all the answers to the questions that I had, I can say definitely that I did enjoy this film. If you are a fan of Nolan, I would recommend that you give it a watch.Spoiler Theory - Neil is Max."
2185,I thought we left movies like this in 80s. A super hero kills hundreds while the coolest Russian mafia boss and 1000 Russian solders die in a second. It just simple reverse effects with pretty low plot with many holes in it. The main actor is more suitable for a rap music video. Pretty low quality movie which everybody tries seeing something special in it. Sound track is loop-based beats which even my grandma can create in 5 min.
2186,"Have to admit, was lost the first time I watched it. The second time made everything so clear. The second time around, watch with captions to catch the in depth detail of the dialogue. This is an excellent movie in all aspects."
2187,"This is the second time (after Dunkirk) that I'm disappointed by a Nolan movie because of the bad writing. Please, Mr. Nolan, stop trying to write your movies!
This one is practically just one big scam. It would have you believe that you have to watch it twice to fully get it, and when you do it'll be mindblowing. And if you still don't get it after multiple viewings, then it means you're just not smart enough. Well, no. The only thing that watching this movie several times will do is point out all the plot holes that make the story actually incoherent.
It's as if Nolan felt he had a great idea that he really wanted to exploit but couldn't manage to make it go anywhere so he buried it under layers and layers of confusion so we wouldn't notice. The result is a movie that's like a puzzle which, once you put the pieces together, shows a picture that makes no sense.
I'm giving it a 5 because I can't deny that the action sequences though are very enjoyable to watch."
2188,"Non sense at all
Do I need to understand what is going on?"
2189,"***Spoilers ahead, but who cares, right***In general, this movie is ok, it is not terrible to watch. The protagonist is an interesting character, at least in the first part of the movie. He is trying some James-Bondesque moves at the beginning of the movie, and playing it all smooth and elegant spy (although you start to wonder how the transition from a SWAT officer to a costume-wearing, martini-sipping international spy happens so fast). The sidekick (played brilliantly by Robert Pattinson) is probably the best part of the movie. The action and special effects are superb. I didn't have a problem with the dialogue as I use subtitles anyway. The story was masked as extraordinarily complicated, in order to lure the viewers to believe they are watching something interesting and valuable and feel smart when they understand some of the sci-fi parts. Well, at some point you stop pretending that the sciency stuff makes any sense and start paying attention to the story. And then the problems of this movie come to the surface, as it is actually so shallow, that the muddy pseudoscientific nonsense can barely cover it.
The female lead character was so incredibly dull, shallow, pathetic, full of cliches, and not making any sense in general, that I started to get angry every time she opens her mouth. With her appearance, she threw away 50 years of female character development and empowerment to the trash. She was so incredibly weak, inconsiderate, unintelligent, unable to grasp the information, presented to her, spending her time between crying, begging, laying, making stupid decisions, and doing the opposite of what she's been asked to. Almost as if the creator of the character was only aware of the female characters from 40 years ago, when the sole purpose of the women in movies was to wear dresses and scream while being saved. I am not even sure what was her purpose, except to become the reason for 2-3 action scenes. At some point, she was given a task - to mind her own business for an hour and to try not to kill her own husband. A task, that would decide the future of mankind. A task, which she failed, and then she was like ""I just couldn't let him die in peace, I knew you would think of another way to save mankind. I just had to kill him"". Well, bravo, so reasonable ... so brave! I don't think she even understood what were people trying to tell her, as there was one point when the Protagonist was explaining, that all people are going to die and she just sighted ""including my son"". Of course, including your son you, broken lightbulb! She was so Why was the protagonist risking the destruction of the whole freaking universe, just to help her, even if they weren't even romantically involved? The only way this whole thing would make sense would be if the son is actually Neil, which is not really profoundly clever and it's just an excuse for a sequel.The villain - the Russian mob - he was just a cartoon of a character. His intentions were so unbelievably stupid. That reason to end the world made no sense. And to keep his wife as a hostage, using some painting ... how is that going to work?In general, the creators of the movie spent so much time and effort to prepare the special effects, the sci-fi element, and the action scenes, that they probably realized they don't have a story and characters, and they just scrambled something in the last minute and poured it in the mix. The result is some half-baked movie that doesn't satisfy anyone's taste."
2190,"I don't know why people think you can't understand what the actors are saying. I can almost fully comprehend just like other movies. I think its the reverse sequences where everything is reversed including what they say, which nobody can understand.
Rest all is just amazing, like the sequences where some are going forwards and others backwards through time, they are perfectly synchronized. There seems to be no flaw, in all these sequences. They plot is heavy and I will need perhaps two more watches to fully understand."
2191,"This movie was mind bending! From the thrilling action scenes to everything going backwards and forwards at the same time, you'll be left wondering what the hell is going on? It's a shame to see so many viewers bashing this movie just because they didn't understand it. This is a modern day masterpiece, Christopher Nolan has outdone himself this time around with a truly challenging movie to the intellect I doubt anyone would comprehend the movie on the first viewing... It's like a puzzle to piece together and i definitely recommend multiple viewings which I will need as well and I'm fine with that. This is truly a breathtaking film, a love letter to sci fi and old school espionage/ lovers of the Christopher Nolan esque action scenes... the score is legendary albeit wasted in some scenes imo. The cinematography is beautiful, the plot is complex, Nolan has outdone himself this time around and everything about this movie screams perfection ! 10/10. Buy it re watch it, re watch it, re watch it."
2192,"From the time our two protagonists encounter another protagonist with his face hidden you instantly know this is someone encountering themselves, we've all seen enough time travel films to know this. The whole film plays out with these kind of tropes and paper thin characters we've seen hundreds of times in other films. Perhaps this would be okay if it did something new with them... but it doesn't.Its well shot on clearly a very large budget, has a fine cast who are all doing their best but the dialogue is dull and the 'plot' nothing new. As a concept you can see why this might make a good film but it gets tied down in too many big set pieces and the finale with lots of soldiers running around while things explode just feels completely dull and uninvolved.Clearly a talented director but perhaps less so a writerr, much like Quentin Tarantino, the more self indulgent his films become the less enjoyable to watch they are. If you liked the last couple of Batman films he did you will probably enjoy this, its very similar in tone, noise and realism."
2193,Haven't Understood It completely on first watch because for most people watching it twice or thrice to get it completely is recommended.It is undoubtedly nolan's most complex movie but action scenes are just breathtaking.
2194,I'm not going to pretend I understood everything about this film but that didn't stop me really enjoying it. Ignore the 1 star reviews that just seem to hate everything that isn't marvel or explained to them like a toddler
2195,"Mostly every aspect of this movie is boring AF!Only cool thing here was well.. nothing!Was like a messy/choppy terminator movie with very little action..
Had alot of running and grumbled shouting tho if you like that in movies!3/10 at best!"
2196,"AMAZING action scenes, some of them i have no idea how they filmed it, but story is too complicated and pulls you out of the movie. With them jumping from going forward in time, to going backwards you go crazy trying to figure out what's happening. Nolan is a great writer, but i think he tried to make this as complicated as possible. Good acting, soundtrack, direction etc. Reeeeeally great and damn creative scenes, but unnecessary complicated. 7,5/10"
2197,The COVID pandemic doesn't stop me from going to see this movie that I've been planning to see years. I've seen TENET 9x this year. Straight up IMAX.
2198,"If you mind is pretty cool - you can at least understard this firlm on 70% procents.
When I crossed half the length of the film , i started to understand this interpretation. And then when left 50 minutes of film i really started to feel this all throught the vision of Nolan. Sometimes after viewing 2-3 seconds of frame in my mind I tried to predict what would happen, and i really predicted some frames. Friends , this movie is hard+interesting+super well done sound way+nice frames at the end of film. After viewing you ll maybe stay like 5 minutes to understand what Nolan does with your brain and eyes. Absolutely great job"
2199,"Tenet is all the spectacle you could ever hope for in a James-Bond-ish action movie of this caliber. Filmed with huge IMAX cameras and real stunts, this movie packs action in a way never seen before. Combine that with a plot that plays with time in an interesting manner and what you get is one hell of a complicated thriller.
Watching this movie on the largest (preferably IMAX Laser or even more so IMAX 70/15) possible cinema screen will give all but that 1% of you the best movie experience of the year!But is that enough?Let me start from the beginning:
I did watch this movie 4 (!) times, always in german, so I cannot complain about voice-clearity issues due to the synchronization.
Of those 4 times I have been 3 times to our nearest IMAX-Laser-4k cinema with a whopping 600 squaremetres (about 5000 squarefeet) of screen in Sinsheim (about 100km away, thats about 60 miles for you american and english folks) and once (the second time) to a much closer usual Multiplex cinema.
As you might be able to tell from that, I did not like it in the normal Cineplex.
The Image was so freaking small in comparison and, adding to that, our local cinema decided (since the movie is in the slightly taller than usual Aspect Ratio of 2.2:1 instead of 2.4:1) to crop the sides of the frame to a 16:9 aspect ratio and then the top and bottom to make the 2.2:1 fit into that 16:9 one. The result was insulting and anyone responsible should be fired. I've heard of other cinemas having the same issue, but that does not make the issue less of an issue.
This movie (well any movie really - but this one especially) is made to be seen on the largest screen possible - preferably giant IMAX screen - and YOU GUYS JUST CROP IT DOWN??? WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? (IF AT ALL)Well so much on that issue - lets go on to the other viewings in that glorious IMAX Format.
It was awesome! It's been my first IMAX 70/15 filmed movie to see on an IMAX screen. and it was sharp, the sound was enormous, the bass was clear and - contrary to that other cinema - people actually cared about the movie more than about their smartphones. The giant 1.43:1 Aspect ratio filled the entire screen and I looked up and down and was just amazed by how much picture there was! That is for the most part of the movie. Some scenes (about 1/3 of the movie; mostly dialog) crop to that 2.2:1 aspect ratio I have been talking about, but even cropped the image was so much bigger than on that normal screen.
It was FANTASTIC!So what about the movie?
Yep, it is kinda like Inception. You have to watch it twice! - or at least that is what everybody tells you to do - I would rather suggest to watch it as many times as you need (or prevail) to understand the story of that movie.
I saw Inception 3 times in one week this year, but each time I saw a different movie, because I got a lot more out of it every single time.
With Tenet the story is pretty much the same except for one thing:
As I watched Inception more and more times, I got underlying themes and ""deeper meaning"" (whatever you think that means) out of it as well as understand the plot better and better. (I could argue about the meaning in Inception for hours, but that is another topic for another day) With Tenet I did not get that kind of something to be learnt from that movie (except for the really interesting way time works within that movie).
You gotta know, I do specifically not want to point this out as a bad thing, just as a thing. As it stands, this movie is a James-Bond-ish spy movie which is a genre you either love or hate or do not really care about (but you would not be reading this if you did not, would you?). This genre barely plays with grandeur philosophical concepts and so, I guess, does Tenet. I have to point out that there might be some thing I am still missing and that someone finds those greater truths in that movie, or even I myself will in the future, but as of right now I cannot say that I get that extra something.
Of course I have to also point out that art does not have to have meaning, it does not have to do anything. Almost like a human being its pure existence can be enough for someone to love it. This is why I am feeling harder and harder about giving ratings to movies that are ""art"" (whatever art is to you). This is why i will not give a rating to Tenet.
But, as a Christopher Nolan-""fan"" as you might call me (you might be correct) I do admit that I love the logic in his works and coming to a conclusion that matters in my own world gives me the highest sense of logic; the sense of having learnt something.
I have to add the following: the movie kept me going even on the 4th viewing; that is except for the first third of the movie. You ""get"" that part at some point and it gets a little boring, but that changes again as you enter the second third.All of this leaves me to talk about the technical aspects - well no.
Not here. Just google it and look up what those stunt coordinators have achieved. For the heck of it just watch the movie! It is all in there.I have to be a little nitpicking, so just gonna throw this into the mix: One thing I missed was one of the inverted guys throwing away their magazine because it was full. That would've been such a great shot!Anyway, ending this review I want to pay huge respect to Christopher Nolan, his wife Emma Thomas and his entire crew for making such a great movie experience possible in modern days and especially the year 2020! Thank you!
This is the probably best movie of 2020."
2200,"Just like everyone else on first viewing you feel like the dumbest person on the planet. It's only after discussing it with my daughter and watching it again did I ""start"" to get it. Sure many people want to go to the cinema and be entertained, to escape. So for those people (and don't get me wrong I was hugely entertained even after a third viewing) that want a couple of hours of unchallenged escapism this movie won't work for them.BUT (in a good way); this is yet again testament to the genius of Nolan. If he only made one movie as great as this he could live off the plaudits for the rest of his life. Without exception he has created half a dozen (if not everyone) works of art. He is transcendent. I've seen the Sistine chapel and it's impressive but what Nolan does is touched by God (and I don't believe in any of the man made religions!).I hope one day I can write something a tenth as good as a storyline as he's written here. It's flawless. If you don't get it just go and see it again.Oh and as for not being able to hear the odd word of dialogue do you really think this was an oversight? His attention to detail would have picked up on this. This was deliberate? You just need to listen a bit harder. Don't expect a genius to make sense, but as they go he often does.Still trying to fathom the end war scene! Hang on maybe I am pretty dumb, or just ignorant, oh well blissfully I will await the DVD release!"
2201,"Great action sequences but inaudible dialogue, nonsensical plot and stiff characters. Nolan's worst impulses exemplified."
2202,"Don't get me wrong, I have no problems with complex films, but this film simply does not explain the very rules of your world. It's just an unbridled action pack with characters that I don't even remember the name with motivations that until now I didn't understand, it's easy to know who the villain is because it's quite obvious, but I just didn't understand the rules that govern this world. The sound is terrible, the effects and music are much louder than the dialogues."
2203,"Great concept, loved it a lot... disliked however the cinematic language used, too hollywoodish."
2204,"I often wonder when I think of Christopher Nolan and his high-concept ideas why is he doing this to himself? The plots of movies like ""Memento"" and ""Inception"" were hard to follow for the viewer--albeit, after wrapping your head around them, they were genius--but just imagine how difficult it must've been to write them. And this one is the most complex of them all.If this is enough to convince you to watch Christopher Nolan's ""Tenet"" then you might as well stop reading at this point. From a Nolan-esque point-of-view, you will be satisfied--as will be all the internet film theorists who are just scrambling to untangle everything there is. For them, this is the most satisfying work perhaps since ""Mulholland Dr."" but for me, I can't be bothered. For all its complexity, the most amazing thing that Nolan did here was making his concept comprehensible enough for people to follow the plot--that is fine enough for me even if I often find myself retracing each character's steps, trying to tie everything together. But when I happen to grasp the realization of his ideas, is like my mind can't handle it--trying to fully unwrap this movie is tiring, hard work, and it's not even the point anyway.The title of this review might also seem like a blur to you if you hadn't seen ""Tenet"" but once you see it, you'll get it. One of the reason Nolan's concepts are so intelligent, creative and interesting is because they are often based on scientific taboos. He knows that, and he is not afraid to show off. This is one of the most opulent, disgustingly luxurious movies I've ever seen. Some of these set-pieces, the stunts, the amount of polished metal that gets blown away feels like it would cost more than most studios would agree on. But this is Christopher Nolan. He doesn't want it any other way. Denying 3D and computers as much as he can, I bet it wasn't hard to convince Warner Bros. to throw him a 200 million dollar check--although I am sure this wouldn't have happened looking at the state of the world now.So, I am glad this movie managed to get done. And as much as I am appalled by the elitist suits and designer brands, I also kinda like the cheekiness. But Nolan did not do this because he could. What bothers me about all this luxury is the reason why I think is there--is not because of a show of attitude, but because of Nolan's compulsive need to be taken seriously. This is a director whose constant brooding sometimes gets the better of him. It rarely happens, but here it did the most. I was even wondering if a scene containing gold bars falling from a plane had actual gold bars. They weren't real, were they? They were? No, they couldn't have been.This presentation extends to the characters, which are often charming. I won't get into the plot but just know that it's a big deal: espionage, billionaires, World War III, The Apocalypse--all the good stuff thrown into the blender to create the sweetest orange juice possible, almost to the point where it's childish. But if the lead, known only as The Protagonist, is played fluidly by a flamboyant John David Washington and Kenneth Branagh's Russian oligarch Sator could pass as a bond-villain undetected--Russian accent included--then it's a shame that Elizabeth Debicki's Kat comes out as a loser way too many times--there was even a scene containing domestic violence. It was odd, out-of-place and unnecessary, especially coming from a Christopher Nolan movie, and it left a really bad taste in my mouth.Overall, the script is efficient. There is barely any chit-chat, every line serving to forward the plot. It has to! Nolan's script is complex enough, and while the dialogue serves its purpose of trying to help us make sense of what's going on in front of our naive eyes, then its lack of human connection, albeit inevitable, only serves to thicken the screen separating us from the characters. Everything is about Nolan's formula. It's amazing how it sustains this movie, but then again it took him over five years to write it into a script."
2205,"5 out of 10 because it was equally good as it was bad.
The entire movie spent trying to hear what they were saying. So annoying. I actually thought the cinema was playing a pirated copy. Any talking in this movie is accompanied with muffling from a gas mask at the start or crap music or sound effects throughout the rest of the film. And as soon as they stop talking, the music or sound also stopped! WTF!!The action and fight scenes were great.And for some strange reason I walked out of the cinema backwards and saw myself through the window going to buy a ticket to this movie. I tried to stop myself from the disappointment but you know, What's happened has happened."
2206,"Absolutely love the action. Every action sequence is fantastic! Ludwig Göransson did an amazing job on the score. Still, it was LOUD. The pacing around the beginning made it really hard to follow the characters' objectives along with not stop dialogue which is hard to hear at times."
2207,"Tenet, is probably a movie you could call ""different"" and ""unique"", so hats off for that. It's also concept before character. The characters aren't the priority, bar except for one, that maintains a flow and arc to the plotThe first half is pretty bland, and easily the weak part of the film, it really has a lot of issues getting into momentum. Then when it kicks into action, its honestly a great movie. If you don't pay attention however in the ""less interesting"" first half, then you might as well not watch the movieIt has a lot of mouth drops and honestly it can be too convoluted for its own good and I could see ways they could've made it more digestible.The sound mixing however is just as bad, as everyone has already said. It distracted me throughout the whole music. Also some terrible background music, well its not really background music if its louder than the characters? Ruined the film a bit, keep it for the action scenes, but conversations in the movie are hit/missI give Tenet 7/10, all the good reasons to like the movie, are however something you should explore yourself. This is definitely a movie made for re-watches"
2208,"Constantly changing scenes. As soon as you start to get used to the environment, the location and new actions immediately change. Everything happens so quickly that it reminds of TikTok.This is a serials squeezed into the frame of a 2.5 hour film. They show the key moments, and you sit and try to connect the line that is held on the thin thread of the idea. Foreground actor always with one emotion.6 swipes in tiktok out of 10"
2209,"The description given under the title is completely false, tenet is an organization not a ""word weapon"". The movie is EXTREMELY confusing with the whole future to past time traveling. My friends and I went to watch at the theatre and we all had to read the plot online because we were just so confused about what happened. Once you read the synopsis the storm in your mind cleared up a little and now all of the questions roll in; if the past characters unknowingly saw their future selfs then the whole movie just repeats itself and it becomes an endless loop, if people from the future hid the ""bomb"" in 9 different places to prevent a world war in the past?? HOW DOES THAT EVEN WORK? wouldn't the war already have happened?????????
But I have to say the effects are very well done and the acting is quite good
Overall, would I recommend this movie? Yes and no, here's why; if you're looking for a movie to watch just for fun without looking at it with a critical eye then sure, go for it. But if you're looking for something to watch where you want to know in details what happened and actually learn something, you're in wrong placeThank you for reading my ted talk"
2210,"Don't overthink it when you're watching, just enjoy the ride!"
2211,"Loved every minute of it, very confusing at first but really came together at the end. Can't wait to go see it again and support my local theater."
2212,"A never-ending loop.Tenet is an exhilarating and mind-boggling movie to watch. It's about a secret agent who embarks on a dangerous, time-bending mission to prevent the start of World War III.
This movie .......I don't know how to describe how I feel about it. I watched it yesterday and being honest I feel like I have a better understanding of the movie now than while I was watching it in time. And that's not a bad thing! Most of Christopher Nolan's films make me feel this way. This movie is very complex in a good way. There are so many layers and seeing them all unfold and intertwine during the movie was really interesting.I love the complexity of the characters too. Each new face you see on the screen, you pay close attention to. With, that being said, each character is well developed even the antagonist, Andrie Sator (Kenneth Branagh). My major pet peeve is when the quote on quote bad guy is just that ...a bad guy. Kenneth Branagh did a good job making me intrigued by the backstory of his character and trying to figure out his thinking. I also liked watching the scenes between his character and Kat (Elizabeth Debicki). You could always feel the tension between the two, and you believed whatever emotions they were acting out. It made you feel uncomfortable for Kat to be around Andrie, but that is the point. I think the arc that they gave Kat toward the end was great.I also loved the dynamic between Neil (Robert Patterson) and ""The Protagonist"" (John David Washington). They just clicked. You could see the blooming of friendship on-screen. I loved it.Now the action scenes in this movie are going to be talked about and analyzed for a long time. I think these scenes were what I enjoyed the most out of the whole movie. This movie changes the way you perceive and think about motion. The fights could be viewed in so many ways, and each would convey something totally different.And the cinematography. Not only was this a cool concept, but it was an aesthetically pleasing movie to look at. Every angle felt intentional, and it was so cool to see the way Christopher Nolan portrayed time going backwards on screen. Christopher Nolan's mind is beautiful.I think everyone should watch this movie sometime. If you like movies that have many layers and easter eggs, this is the movie for you. You won't stop thinking about this movie for days. Everything is connected; a never-ending loop."
2213,"This film had already become infamous for its sound mixing, which Nolan has been known for in the past, but is doesn't subtract from an overall terrific, thought-provoking film. At this movie's core, it's a spy movie, but like with most of Nolan's films, it has something else to it that gives the sub-genre a twist, like Inception, with the introduction of time inversion. I liked the premise and time inversion idea, it's complicated, but interesting, and it makes you as an audience member to actually think about what're you're seeing on screen. The use of practical and visual effects is mindblowing to say the least, especially towards the latter half of the film. I'd say the weakest part of this movie is the opening 20 minutes, it's hard to follow at times and sometimes you don't know why characters are doing what they're doing. But on second viewing, it is easier to follow, and I found myself throughly invested in the story, the twists, and some clever time-bending action."
2214,"So where do I even begin? If you know anything about me I'am a huge I mean huge fan of Christopher Nolan's films. Who made some of my favorite films including Inception, Memento, The Dark Knight, Interstellar, Batman Begins, Dunkirk, The Prestige etc. For me, I enjoy all his films and for me, he hasn't really made a bad film, for me my least favorite would be Dark Knight rises which is still a solid film (7.5/10) And so as you can tell I was very excited for this film especially the secrecy that surrounded the film, typical for Nolan films. So after anticipating this film for about a year, is it any good? Or Am I going to get Phantom Menaced, well accuse me of being a Nolan fan boy but I had one hell of a time. Tenet is a thrilling and original cerebral espionage thriller, rich in atmosphere and contains some of the most inventive action sequences I've seen in a long time, with a outstanding lead performance by John David Washington.
The cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema is gorgeous and the way he and Nolan film the action set pieces (of course doing 99% practical) really immerse you into the sequences. Without spoilers anything this film is very complex but never becomes convoluted, I would actually say this is one of Nolan's simplest films yet it's still very dense and after seeing it, I only understood a quarter of it but as days went on and discussed about it, the clearer it gets. Really at the heart of the film is Elizabeth Debicki storyline (who I won't spoil) which connects with Kenneth Branagh character plays a terrifying and villainous antagonist who is terrifying, but the actor who steals the show is Robert Pattinson as Neil, every scene he steals and after giving us excellent performances in Good Time, High Life, The King, The Rover and now thi,s he has become of the best actors working in the industry and has gone a long way from being the pretty boy from twilight and has become a excellent actor. And I believe he'll give us the best batman.( I stand by that) Overall I enjoyed the hell out of this film and had a great time, A nice and welcome return to the cinemas. 8.5- 9/10 for me. If you're fan of Nolan's work I highly recommend it."
2215,"""Just because you don't take time to understand a film doesn't mean it is bad"" - This statement can almost describe every critic and even some fan reviews. The fact of the matter is this film isn't for everyone. You have to be invested in the idea of inversion as a whole to truly understand this film. Not Emily from buzzfeed who's favorite movie is twilight. Is tenet complicated? Hell yes. Tenet is easily director Christopher Nolan's most complex film to date but it's also his most ambitious in that right. This is Christopher Nolan's take on a bond film and wow is it spectacular. Now to actually the review part of the movie. Tenet clearly shows that most of Christopher Nolan's work has led up to this film. You can see influences of Inception, Memento, and Dunkirk clearly present. That is not a critisism however due to it only elevating the film to be somewhat familiar but still a breathe of fresh air from the ""rollercoaster films"" we are used to seeing in 2020. The only critisism I have for tenet is the setting up for the story was not done as well as it could and became often a jumbled mess of connections to characters that you know nothing else about. The biggest strength of tenet is its last act however. The pacing is incredible and keeps you invested in the films finale. The ending didn't quite have the punch of Nolan's other films such as Interstellar but it still was a satisfying ending none the less. I do hope Nolan goes against his norms and makes a sequel for tenet however as out of all Nolan's films other than the dark knight this film cries for a sequel. In conclusion tenet isn't for the people looking for a simple film or people who have critisized Nolan's films in the past but if you do not fall under that category then Tenet is an engaging spy movie like none you have ever seen before and is among the director's best. Tenet is spectacular...."
2216,"Not sure if it was the cinema I went to (Cineworld) or the film is actually like this, but I found it very difficult to hear most of the film due to the background music. Stop reading here to avoid a minor spoiler.......also difficult to understand what the actors were saying in the time when they are wearing masks."
2217,"Tenet is fascinating and exciting and fun, but I think the pace was too quick. I really feel like this movie should have been either two movies or significantly longer. The first part of the movie had enough events and things going on to make up it's own interesting movie, but it just felt like a trailer for a movie. I feel like Nolan just wanted to hurry up an get to the main part of the story he wanted to tell. All that being said, I thought the inversion and use of Maxwell's Demon made for an interesting story that was a wild ride of a movie. I will definitely be going back to see this again while it's in the theater because that is the place it needs to be seen. I think Tenet, like Memento, will provide me with years of re-watches and enjoyment."
2218,"This is an action movie where you can't think too hard, because it then won't make sense. At its heart is technology that makes time reversal possible - you can (slowly) go back in time, but not jump around in time quickly. Still, that can give interesting special effects, when the forwards and backwards time streams occur ""simultaneously"". The ""grandfather paradox"" is mentioned in passing, but the whole movie is such a paradox. The villain has acquired time reversal technology from the future, and is planning to use it to destroy the world. But if he succeeds, where will he find the technology to help him succeed?"
2219,"Good movie. Something just didnt feel right about the tallin drive seen where they left the female alone in the car. Anyways Patterson from end and beyond to start and Washington in right order, What we don't see is he gets in charge of the team to save the world and recruiting Patterson(Neil) in the first place. But we do see he ""recruit"" him again in his timeline.. Also what done is done, They keep saying but He figures it out cuz of the backback of neil and the start in the opera house, so he lie to him and say he never gonne see the girl or max again, but goes back in time when she call him and tells him where the murder of her son took place, And he change the past/future or whatever for a happy ending. Right?"
2220,"I was so excited to finally watch this movie. The trailers looked awesome and I thought it would surely be a great innovative and new concept never seen before. Sadly, as complicated and convoluted as the plot was for this movie, I could not hear hardly any of the dialogue. It is IMPOSSIBLE to follow the story and understand what is happening because you can not hear what exactly the actors are saying. Everything from heavy accents, people wearing masks, and the sound effects over powering the voices made this movie very unwatchable. I felt like I was watching a foreign film majority on my time. Someone dropped the ball on this blockbuster! With the plot so difficult to follow as is already, this just made it 10 times worse. I enjoyed the bits and pieces of the film that I actually could comprehend. I'm sure once I watch it again with subtitles that it would be quite entertaining and enjoyable. I'm giving this film 4 stars for the little bit of the plot I could actually follow and the visual effects but don't spend your money to watch this in the theater or you'll be just as confused and upset as I was when it ended. You have been warned."
2221,"From the get go, the action sequences throughout were absolutely fantastic and breathtaking to watch. But I feel the story was a bit too complicated for my liking. Inception struck the right balance in that regard."
2222,"Well, where to start. I like it when movies try to outsmart their viewers and I really admire Nolan for his work in Inception, The Dark Knight, Prestige etc. But this movie felt like even Nolan himself was not so eager doing it properly. The production and the editing felt rushed. Especially in the beginning. Character introduction happens in a blink of an eye. The main plot not comprehensible because the audio was so roughly mixed that the music and the SFX felt like little explosions in your head while the spoken world happens under a thick layer of ice. The music was...well was there real music after all? Compared to the magnificent work of Zimmer in Interstellar or Inception this here was just generic modern Drone elements where even Sunn o))) would not be pleased with. The story itself (not the physical background on which this whatever is based on) was kinda predictable since the half of the movie. But what buggers more is the dull story itself: Rich warlord with cancer is not able to get his marriage properly so he just wants to destroy the world. The characters all were one sided without any emotions attached. Even emotional scenes felt just bleak. Nolan can do this so much better (Interstellar did this masterfully). And why cast an Irish actor for a russian villain whereas there are many awesome eastern european actors out there?All in all this movie felt too much cliché and more like a cheap rip off of Nolans previous work. This just felt nothing at all like the work of our well beloved master of modern cinema. This is just a movie without any soul attached to it."
2223,"It's a good movie, but it's not a movie you can fully understand without carefully pay attention to all details, events, theories, and... yeah tenets. For some people, they can even got lost in the first time watching the movie, and leave it without knowing what happened the last two hours, sure. But even if it is incomprehensible, the vibes and events of the work still give you chills and captivate you throughout the movie. Just give it a try, you will feel excessively satisfied if you manage to solve the puzzle by yourself at the cinema, or if you need to do further research and read explanation, analysis after coming home, it's still a rewarding experience when you finally understand something tricky. Yeah, it's a good movie but we must consider all the things from production, screenwriting, to acting, costumes, music, etc. so I give it a 8 (yeah an easy list of criteria of mine)."
2224,"This movie is an art of its own, bending and playing with the current reality as the protagonist dig in deeper into Tenet. Just sit back and have fun while watching this. Try to pick up the obvious details as you watch and everything will be unfold sooner or later as you watch the movie. It's not as ""heavy"" as Inception material but more like 75% there."
2225,"Christopher Nolan sure has a way of pushing the envelope of what is possible in the realms cinematography ever higher. From the opulent film scenery, down right to the time-twisted narratives that are inspired by edge of your seat theoretical physics, the entire production has indeed set a bar for creative control. Not only does Tenet pay an ode and borrow a leaf from previous cinematics, it's also an embodiment of Nolan's sheer creativity and witty imagination. Any subsequent fixtures going forward will have to pull their weight in gold just to resonate with the global audience. As it stands, Tenet is a riveting flick worth the buck and is easily a contender for Best Picture !"
2226,"After watching Interstellar six times, reading a lot of material on the matter, black holes and so on, I now feel like I got a pretty good knowledge in the quantum physics department. The most important thing I learned from all of it is that time/space can only be measured or controlled, if you will, by one constant thing... (Is it constant?! Some might argue) If you have not seen that movie yet, I will not reveal anything to ruin that experience for you.Now, the movie at hand. I had really high hopes for this movie. But I was left down leaving the cinema. At first everything was just forth and back, after that I started to understand it all and it got too predictable for me, and then I lost interest. It had some really good scenes, but somehow it all felt pretty cold and the dialog got boring, to the point that I wondered if I should take the rest of my soda back home with me or not, so I can recycle the bottle.It sad, because I really wanted to like this movie. I love Nolan's previous work. I love sci-fi and time travel as well. This one left me thinking, something is missing. It has to be more than this. I'll tell you this much, Kenneth Branagh did an EXCEPTIONAL job. I loved his part. Bravo! He really is an artist.To be honest, following the logic of Nolan, he did one obvious mistake. He messed up the timeline for his own creations. Not all. But he presented Interstellar before Tenet, it should have been the other way around. But as all great artist' he can only have the imagination before and results after the fact. With that said, this is in no means a bad movie. It is just not that great. That might be my own fault, as I am projected into the art as a missile on the run from it's main target. It will never be easy topping your own great creations. It's a challenge few really experience, I believe. By the way, while I remember it, the soundtrack was not bad, but nothing like the ""meet God"" soundtrack he had implemented in Interstellar.I would have been more happy watching this at a PPV service at home. I don't believe the hype of this being THE cinema movie. We left the cinema, going ""neeh"" to each other. The biggest insult an artist can get, I know. But I suppose we all want the truth in the end.These kind of movies are hard to put on a scale 1-10. Mostly because if you think like this: The Shawshank Redemption is a 10, Interstellar is a 10. But The Fast & Furious (Not the first) but the rest is a 5 max a 6 maybe. So where do this go? I feel this should get better, but not max. So, I'm not 100% sure it's correct or just, but I'll give it 7/10 because of my own timeline in giving point's to my previous views.7/10"
2227,"A very complex story about time and, as to be expected, brilliantly delivered. I'm not sure whether I understood every aspect of the story but now, 3 explanation videos on YouTube later, I'm a little bit smarter and probably I have to see it twice. Another reason for having difficulties to decipher it is that the sound mixing is terrible. The actors are partially hard to understand and the score is way too loud. The volume was like on a techno clubbing. This is going to be fun when people are watching it at home on TV. Last but not least I didn't like that in the end it is like a war movie. I hate that. So for me, after seeing it once, this one is not as brilliant as I have expected it to be. I will watch it again tough."
2228,Tenet has so much interresting aspects and ideas it contains great pictures and rough action but sometimes the film happens too fast. Some things you'll realise at the second or third watching. I like the movie more than Parasite or Joker for me Tenet is the best movie for a long Time. I would recommend the Movie everybody who is a little bit interested in Action movies.
2229,"This score is based on first viewing, blu-ray at home may change it.And....This movie really needs adjustments to the audio mixing, dialog was very hard to hear at times. I do like loud sound effects and everything, but this movie was really too loud. It ended up drowning the quality at several points."
2230,"You can clearly see that much effort was put into this movie. However, and this is a big issue I had, this movie was way too complex. Maybe I tried too hard, but it was not too enjoyable when you closely tried to follow the whole story. Also, some plotholes... What is the purpose of Kat bringing up her son the whole time? Why doesn't she need oxygen on the boat? Whatever happens at the final battle? At some point it just became very strange. Anyway, just my honest opinion. Worth the watch, but definitely not amazing."
2231,"With Inception and Interstellar, Nolan has set the bar incredibly high. Don't get me wrong, Tenet is a good movie, but it is nowhere as good as the other two.I suppose it was optimised for ADD sufferers, but I personally like a bit of backstory and character development. The backstory is nearly nonexistent, the character development starts and ends in a short lunch scene with Michael Caine.Acting? Again, comparing with Matthew McConaughey, Leo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Ellen Page... The leads are OK but not that interesting, with an exception of Dimple Kapadia.The villain is a stereotypical Russian mobster-type oligarch with a generic bad guy motivation. He sends his team of muscle mountains, by the looks of it, freshly recruited from Russian penitentiaries, to follow his wife and beat people up around London. No one bats an eyelid or makes a fuss. Somehow, his wife is a classy British art expert, although somehow pigeonholed into a generic suffering trophy wife stereotype.The protagonist is a generic tough guy. That's it. He doesn't even have a first name.Kapadia's character is probably the most interesting.That said, some bits are simply mind-blowing, especially the last part, when everything starts coming together.Otherwise, it's a great feeling to be able to visit a cinema again, even with a mask and nearly empty."
2232,"People who struggled to keep up with Inception may want to think twice before watching Tenet. It is probably the most complex movie I have ever seen. It eats Primer for breakfast and uses Predestination as a toothpick.That said it deserves every view it can get. This movie is pure, cineastic beauty. Everything has a payoff. The viewer keeps getting rewarded for his attention throughout the entire movie.The whole cast delivers great performances (which was for me as a classic Twilight-hater especially impressive in Robert Pattinson's case).Just watch it. Or maybe don't. Or watch it twice (as that seems to help according to other reviewers)."
2233,"I already know I'll have to watch this film again and again to fully appreciate it. Great story and perfect executions Nolan-style. Dialogues are often hard to understand, with loud, albeit spectacular music score playing over them. My next watch will be with subtitles 😉."
2234,"Thoroughly enjoyed the film and want to see it again to figure out the things I didn't catch.
Even so, the soundtrack definitely needs remixing (my daughter has seen it in a different cinema and felt the same). I regularly struggled to follow the dialogue due to the backing soundtrack."
2235,"I'm gonna make this short. This was probably one of the first big movies that was allowed to be screened during COVID19 so everybody was excited to be back in the cinemas but those excitements were short lived. Right off the bat, the movie hits you with some inaudible dialogues that makes you think if you are hard on hearing or if they are talking in another language. Then the movie starts to paint the picture and finally the finale which was more or less predictable for this genre of movies.
Pretty much everything in the movie from acting to visuals to music was a solid 3/5. After all, it's a Nolan movie and you cannot expect less.
I personally don't like watching movies that I won't understand well enough after once spending my money and time in a cinema. If a movie is going to me too complicated to be understood (to a reasonable level) in one go of cinema, it should be a Netflix or HBO or Amazon show so people can watch it over and over or pause and think. Watching these type of movies in cinema are waste of time and money and you will walk out feeling dumb and a ticket price poorer.
P.S
If you are really into this type of contents, I'd highly recommend Dark on Netflix which is in almost every respect better than Tenet."
2236,"Storyline seriously incomprehensible, voices mumbled, action overly loud, uninteresting charactors A.S.O., yeah, dissapointed enough to try and fall asleep, but it was so overly loud it hurt my ears at times, was bad movie and bad sleep... Maybe a second watch can get me from 4 to 6 stars..."
2237,"I generally like Nolan's work - Prestige and Inception probably being my favorites. However I feel he missed the mark here. For most of the movie I felt like my hearing was going bad. The dialogue was almost constantly muddled by a combination of bad accents, speaking through masks and the extremely loud soundtrack. The first thing my wife asked me was ""did you understand much of what was said?"" so I knew it wasn't just me. And this is not the kind of movie where missing dialog will work. I can't remember the last time I watched an English language film and wished the whole time it had subtitles. I suspect that even if I could understand what was being said, the plot was still overly complicated. I didn't really care whether they saved the world or not. And even the ""good guys"" seemed like they were morally corrupt clear up to the end. This was doubly disappointing because there has been so little new content due to the pandemic that I had really looked forward to this. At least the visuals were relatively interesting."
2238,"This movie is very confusing and hard to understand. And it's better if you don't get too deep into understanding of this movie.
But when you understand it you realize that it doesn't make sense.
Usually love Nolan's movies, but this one was trying too hard to be ""smart"" movie. Ideas were cool, actors are great, but couldn't fit an sense into this.Plus in this movie all the time when you try to catch it's hard plot, you don't have time to just enjoy it."
2239,"I a huge Nolan nut. I have watched interstellar, inception, prestige, the dark knight many many times and I still enjoy them thoroughly. Tenet got me excited for 2020 but it is missing one key thing.... rooting for the protagonist. In interstellar I loved Mathews relationship with his daughter which drew us closer to him and wanted him to succeed at every turn. In inception we sympathize with DiCaprio due to his fatal mistake of unintentionally killing his wife causing us to go on the journey of how hard it was for him to move on. In prestige we either rooted for bale or hugh because we sympathize with Hugh for bale killing his wife. But we also sympathize with bale for his lack of finance despite his extreme talent. Finally tenet.... it was vapid. The ""protagonist"" has no driving goals to win. He just wants to to stop the antagonist just for the sake of. Then we kind of feel his love for kat but that too fizzles off. We have no reason to root for him. No emotion in the protagonist causes a 3 rd person perspective on the movie instead of a 1 st person perspective taking the journey with the protagonist instead of looking at him going through it. Adding to this the half baked science of time inversion by reversing entropy which is not at all how time works but ok I'll let that go. It does have the signature Nolan ending where everything makes sense in the end and the amazing visuals. But like I mentioned no emotions throughout. I fell asleep in the middle that's how bad it was. If you want to just watch a decent spy movie with half baked science fiction crazy visuals and typical satisfying Nolan ending watch it"
2240,"To say that TENET is confusing would be an understatement. Its the type of confusing that leaves you uninvested in the outcome simply because you have no idea what it is you're watching.The film starts off strongly enough featuring a thrilling sequence at the opera. The score shines brightly and Nolan's executes the scene to perfection. From there on the film placates us with smooth spy stuff type scene of the (literally named protagonist) the protagonist travels the globe and having fancy lunches and threating people to gain information. This all counts for nought as the film further gets into its hook, time travel. Its a relief that Nolan didn't go heavy handed with exposition like he did with Inception however with a plot this complicated some exposition would have been appreciated. The fil does try to explain the mechanics of the time-travel or as the film calls it 'inversion' however its difficult to comprehend given the blaring soundtrack that makes characters sound indecipherable.The film itself revolves around an attempt to prevent a world ending event (involving the future attempting to kill the past) and the main character and his comrades try to prevent it. The performances are just fine however this film is heavily plot driven so much so that we do not have much of a reason to invest emotionally in any of the characters, even John David Washington's suave wanna-be spy only serves to delight with his charisma but lacks in any other area. Robert Pattinson serves as a good enough partner to bounce of dialogue with even though he doesn't have much of a backstory either. The only other character with an emotional arc is Elizabeth Debicki's character and her battle with Sator, the villain. The arc would be a lot more engaging if not the fact that the character almost exists solely to be rescued by the male lead. Kenneth Branagh is absolutely menacing (unrecognisable?) as Sator. He's performance only been hindered by the fact that his actions and story deeply tied to the main hook of the film that I don't know what he's doing or how he's doing it only why, which is very frustrating. Overall the film is a technically marvellous film with fantastic staging of action scene but poorly explained mechanics and plot, shallow characterisation and an obnoxious sound mixing hinder the film from truly being a decent watch."
2241,"100 years from now when the human race is probably smarter, they'll be able to appreciate how ahead of its time it is."
2242,Speculate trust me it is like iteration movie if you watch 1 time after another time you will get new answer
2243,"Just think of it as an adaptation of a 'classic-comic book' . The silly and funky type of comic book.You're not meant to understand the concepts presented in this film , because the in-universe explanations don't make any sense in of themselves. Explanations are 'just as it is'. It is deliberate that it is not explored with different perspectives in the film nor is there an attempt to actually explain things in a clearer manner , cause Nolan could not explain it other than on face value, to himself either.Perhaps the sound mixing was done this way too to muddle whatever explanations that was attempted in the film. And to pass off any confusion in the film's concept as being too intellectual for the viewer to comprehend.Zany time travel ideas which makes zero sense, but looks cool? Supervillian and superhero motivations? Shallow characters and conveniences? This is pretty much the whole shtick of the film. Expect nothing more.
-----A good time travel movie (or novel) is a movie which does not make the whole time travel the center piece of the movie. (cause any time travel is inherently an impossibility, and the said story will fall apart if that is the sole focus) The good ones make the stories about the characters and their motivations.The bad ones just use time travel as a SFX showcase."
2244,"Another masterpiece of my favorite director, mind blowing!"
2245,"Just watch it, it's like nothing else and pay attention while watching because it's so sick to watch it if you're getting it!!"
2246,"For movie geeks like me, this movie is a dream. Nolan delivered. Enough said."
2247,"Ill have to watch this movie once again, absolutely impossible to follow the storyline. Could improve to 8/10 if its something special."
2248,I am so lost and planning to watch again just because right now after one viewing I have no idea what I just saw.
2249,"The concept was very good but the execution was typical of American films, where everything needs to be explained. Even the mundane.Washington was average at best but surprised at Patterson's performance.Inception meets Deja vu."
2250,"The details can prove to be confusing at first watch, but the movie is a masterpiece once you think about it."
2251,"I have watched this film 3 times. The first time I was completely disappointed, the second time I enjoyed it. But OH MY GOD now it all makes sense. I don't usually watch films in the cinema 3 times but I trust Christopher Nolan. Even though I was disappointed and confused the first time, I was still intrigued to why so many were calling TENET a masterpiece. This film is not designed for one viewing, I now understand that. The intense design and extremely complex structure of the film makes for a really confusing experience first time out. But when you watch again the plot is much easier to grasp and the characters motivations become clear. The sound mixing however can sound absolutely terrible depending on where you see it. The first time for me it was horrendous and added to the confusion but the 3rd screening for me was crystal clear. Overall this film on and off screen defies time in a way that I will never forget.Only Christopher Nolan can make a film that gets better the more you watch it."
2252,"Phenomenal.So much depth and complexity to the story a second watch will be worth it. See it the first time if you can in Dolby (or IMAX), the sound is impressive... it was an immersing experience.Pay attention, you won't want to leave your seat."
2253,"Christopher Nolan is one of my favourite director of all time. In my opinion Inception is still his best movie, but this film is as Authentic and Unique as it gets. The scenes of Time Inversion are a treat to watch. For the first hour I didn't understand much about the plot, but afterwards it provides important details. The last 30 minutes are spectacular. The action scenes are like never seen before. The background score helps to make scenes intense but also overpowers dialogue in some scenes. In short is Nolan's take on a Spy thriller film. I can definitely say that it is the most complex Nolan's movie till date. I will probably take 2-3 rewatches to understand it fully. Or you can watch explanation videos on YouTube as I did."
2254,"The story is a 6 but Nolans film making gets the extra star. Surprisingly easier to follow than expected but the audio was horrendous. Heard there are mixed reports, guess it depends on the theater but i could barely hear any conversation. Too much background sounds. Worth seeing, nothing incredible."
2255,"PROS - Entriguing plot, interesting protagonist, and satisfing ending.Cons - The female lead was forgetable and oddly tall."
2256,"We are no stranger to movies that reveal a jaw-dropping twist that changes the lens in which the entire movie must be viewed. People will often tell you that these kinds of movies are ""even better the second time around"". Well I am here to tell you that watching Tenet once is like watching half a movie. You simply must watch it a second time to understand it. Even the most observant and quick-witted audience member is going to have trouble piecing together parts in the first half without the information fed to you in the second half. This film takes mind-bending to a new level in the sense that my brain was completely exhausted after viewing.This leads to my one major complaint about the film. The sound mixing. If any background noise or music was playing in the movie while the characters are talking, I found it very difficult to hear what they were saying. If I had to guess, I only picked up on 60% of dialogue and had to use keywords to try and keep up. A lot of my complaints of movies are minor, but this was a huge drawback that pulled a potentially top 10 movie for me down.Aside from the complexity of the story, I also appreciated the top-tier score, high octane action, and stellar acting. All credit goes to Ludwig for producing such a fast paced and exciting score. The quick repetition of notes with the booming bass had me completely amped up at times. It paired nicely with the action style chosen which included aggresive and fast fighting movements. I am not sure if credit goes to who choreographed or to John Washington for such impressively blood-thirsty and efficient attacks.Tenet is the first film I have ever seen that I would advise anyone who has not seen to allot enough time to watch it twice back to back."
2257,"The plot is pretty fast and complicated, but the movie is great. The action and the tension is constant, there isn't a single moment to rest. I would highly recommend it. The whole cast did a great job. The movie is awesome
Smart people will understand it as films goes on, but probably many others will need to watch it few times and think of it a while..."
2258,"A very well developed atmosphere, from the first minute to the end. My expectations where quite high for this movie, but it got my interest at the beginning and bumped it up ever so slightly a new part of the puzzle was revealed. The well developed plot and interesting and different action scenes made me love this film."
2259,"Most Nolan fans will love this regardless, right from the start it was intense and LOUD. Gripping and clever, with intense dialogue. Leads were excellent and as ever amazing scenic scapes. I will be watching again."
2260,Awesome direction by Christopher Nolan. Wonderful performance by John David Washington and Robert Pattinson. This movie deserves more than oscar. A mind bending thriller to been seen in theaters only
2261,"While some elements of the film were rushed and out of place and the action was confusing to follow most of the time, the ideas the film was trying to establish worked great for me. The ending was emotionally captivating and though the structure of the film spoiled its own ending, the cleverly played around that and suggested that the end of the film is not the end of the story, only a part of a greater loop, the ending of which might change the perception of our protagonist in the real end of it.This is pretty much all that I can give without spoilers, the story feels complicated when you are watching the film, so confusion is a part of the emotional gamma the viewer will be subjected to. I will surely watch it again, and I want to thank Nolan and the team behind this great film."
2262,"This man never dissapoints.When it comes to sci-fi movies ,he is the most intelligent and he showed it again in this movie.The acting is great as usual in his movies,astonishing sound and effects but the actual scenario is what makes the movie shine.You may want to watch it a second time though,so you can fill those spaces you missed through your first time watching.Just amazing.10/10"
2263,"This is a movie that demands a second viewing. And a third. Maybe a fourth if you're up for it. The first time I watched it, the first half of the movie felt a little jarring, considering that this is Nolan's fastest-pace movie to date. But once you're strapped in, this film is like an upside down puzzle that, when complete, the complex narrative seemingly becomes quite simple. This movie is ground-breaking in it's own right, having personally never seen a fight sequence where the two opponents are fighting in two directions of time. He demonstrates technical mastery of the likes you have not ever seen. If this is confusing, Nolan explains this best. Would 110% recommend this for anyone looking for a brutally exciting and thought-provoking experience."
2264,"... like Casablanca 😉.Granted, less emoting compared to maybe Interstellar, n Inception; but oh my Sator! what a brilliant sci-fi story.I wonder how many times Christopher Nolan had to revise his screenplay in order to make sure he didn't trip over himself.Those on the blue team, you know what I'm talking about.
Those on the red team, just relax n enjoy the ride... it'll come to you.* Inversion is normal in physics (like frequency, to cancel out noise), but when applied to time ... wtflow. 2.5hrs film felt too short, a series is inevitable."
2265,"It is unbelievable that with only 12 Euros I was able to see such a great movie. All those people that gave so much for this to happen. A lot of hard work turned into something great.
Thank you!"
2266,"I loved everything about this movie. The chemistry between the actors is great. The cast is unreal. The soundtrack is perfect. The cinematography in so many scenes just blows you away. Seriously this would've won all the awards if it was going against 1917 last year which it could've because it would've gone back in time if it was real.
I love the main actors. The casting was perfect. Christopher Nolan is just a genius. It's simple. Don't try to understand the movie. Just go with it and it becomes a masterpiece"
2267,I really couldn't wait to watch this film and boy was it worth it. I had read reviews before mostly positive but some people complained about the music score or explosions muffling the characters taking and not understanding what is going on. Let me tell you this is not the case I could hear the dialogue clearly. The film was complicated and you do need a think outside the box attitude when watching but the film grips you pulls you in one direction and then another and although complicated plot it did make sense at the end (well almost) a few things I didn't get but some have said you benefit from watching a few times it's one of those films but I have seen some weird and complicated films that i literally have no idea what is happening and left thinking this was utter confusing for the sake of it and drivel but this is not the case with this film. If you loved memento or inception then you will love this film. If you need everything laid out for you and baby walked through each scene then you shouldn't really watch as you won't enjoy it. It's a thinking mans film and will certainly have you discussing in the future with all your like minded friends when they see it.
2268,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Christopher Nolan has delivered some of my favorite movies of the century. All the way from Memento to the most recent Dunkirk, I've yet to dislike one of his films, so expectations are always high with him. The current global pandemic closed movie theaters worldwide, but fortunately, some countries already opened them, including my own. My IMAX screening of Tenet was my first trip to a theater since February! As a firm believer and strong advocate of the so-called ""cinematic experience"", I would always remember fondly the day I returned to a place I hold very close to my heart independently of my opinion about the film. Nevertheless, it became an even more special day once I left that enormous screen behind with a happy face.Nowadays, people complain about everything, especially on social media. So, I'm not surprised that the ""savior of cinema"" marketing tagline triggered so many souls. If Nolan didn't have enough haters, it surely got a few more after this campaign. Me? I look at it like any other marketing scheme: it's intended to hype its own movie, so I don't really understand why this specific publicity caused so much controversy. Obviously, ""savior of cinema"" doesn't mean Nolan is going to save theaters from dying. It's just a tagline trying to hype the first major blockbuster in several months! It's a marketing strategy to try and convince people to give Tenet a go. If there's a film meant to be seen at the biggest screen possible, this is the one.I'll get the outstanding technical achievements out of the way. Inception and Interstellar boast impressive visuals that are hard to compete with, but Tenet is up to the challenge. With uniquely complex, stunning, grand set pieces, Nolan delivers riveting action based on a mind-blowing temporal concept that will make every single viewer scratch their heads. I lost count to the number of times I tried to open my eyes more so I could see (and understand) everything that was going on. Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is handheld for a lot of action sequences, and he has such control over his craft that he was able to capture some of the most jaw-dropping action moments of the last few years through gorgeous angles and a firm grip.Nolan said that Tenet would be ""the hardest movie to cut"" for any editor. Jennifer Lame's editing plays a vital role in the time inversion sequences. It's relatively easy to imagine how brutal of a task she must have had. She's incredibly consistent throughout the runtime with perfectly timed cuts that elevate even the simplest of scenes. I wish I could be more specific, but in order to avoid spoilers, I'll just write this: she has a bunch of nominations coming her way, including an Academy Award. Ludwig Göransson's score is tremendously powerful, and it definitely adds to the magnificent action set pieces, especially in the third act.Finally, Nathan Crowley (production designer) creates such a realistic look that it almost made me believe this could actually occur in the real world. CGI has come a long way, and it's indisputably a tool that can completely transform films into something fascinating when used correctly. However, practical effects will always offer a feeling impossible to replicate through computerized images. It's probably the aspect I appreciate the most about this movie: its massive application of practical effects and real stunts. It surrounds the physics-defying premise within a bubble of realism, and that's only achieved with talented people in the right technical departments.Story-wise... this is where it gets tricky. I have to be honest about my experience: I found it surprisingly okay to follow and not that challenging to understand. This doesn't mean that it isn't a remarkably complex, layered narrative with ideas that will be incredibly hard for some people to comprehend. I'm not trying to patronize anyone, far from that, but some viewers will inevitably leave the theater without completely understanding what they just saw, simply because it's a two-hour-and-a-half movie packed with heavy exposition about a fictional quantum physics concept. For example, in the same way that some people genuinely can't have a 3D perspective, other people will also have visual difficulties in distinguishing the inverted sequences.The need to be vague about plot details doesn't let me explain a lot, but the unique concept Nolan develops in Tenet is undoubtedly an exceptionally intriguing idea. As crazy as it might sound, I found the visuals more confusing than the actual scientific explanations that they go with. Unfortunately, that's one of my main issues with the film. Throughout the entire runtime, there's an excessive load of exposition about the time shenanigans. It's a massive amount of information for anyone to be able to remember every single detail. Even worse, some dialogue sequences feel so incredibly forced that it's almost like the movie stops for quick breaks where the characters explain something directly to the audience.This last point leads me to another problem. John David Washington gets better and better as time goes by, but he feels like a mediator between the film and the audience for the first half of the movie. His dialogue revolves around asking questions about what's happening and how the time inversion works, which is obviously understandable given the character's circumstances, but the execution of these conversations lacks that spontaneous vibe. It really feels like someone yelled ""Action!"", the actors did their lines, and that same someone yelled ""Cut!"". Washington isn't exactly a worldwide, well-known actor (Ballers, BlackKklansman), and this is his first big blockbuster appearance, so his inexperience didn't help him through these moments.However, he ends up being a fine protagonist (no pun intended). Robert Pattinson is charming and quite funny, actually. I couldn't avoid the ""humorless"" review headlines, and being totally honest, it's surprisingly a lot funnier than I thought it would (not) be. His character has a vital role in the whole story, and it's through him that most of the knowledge about the intricate concept at hand is developed. Elizabeth Debicki is probably the spotlight stealer, though. With a remarkable performance, she represents the emotional arc of the film, and she delivers one of her best interpretations ever. I was afraid that her storyline would turn into a forced romance, but fortunately, it only helped build Washington's character traits.On the other hand, Kenneth Branagh plays a cliche Russian bad guy with generic motivations who feels way too formulaic for such a ground-breaking movie. But ultimately, that's what Nolan presents. His astonishingly talented methods as a director and his obsession with detail as a writer make Tenet a certainly flawed yet phenomenal film with a concept that might be the hardest he's ever had to pull off. As long as people can remove themselves from the real world and enter a whole new one with entirely different mechanisms and rules, it will be the so-called ""blockbuster of the summer"" that everyone deserves this year.All in all, Tenet undoubtedly boasts an incredibly complex narrative with a unique temporal concept impressively demonstrated through spectacular, loud, jaw-dropping, practical action set pieces. Christopher Nolan is a masterful director and a fascinating writer, but he has to thank its technical crew for creating such a visually stunning blockbuster. From Hoyte van Hoytema's riveting camera work to Jennifer Lame's seamless editing, passing through Ludwig Göransson's powerful score and Nathan Crowley's beautiful production design, Tenet is one of the most technically mind-blowing movies of the last few years. With the help of a remarkable cast (especially Debicki and Pattinson), the definitely intriguing story makes the epic runtime feel a bit shorter, despite some scenes being unnecessary. The heavy and forced exposition throughout the entire film transforms an otherwise entertaining flick into a fictional physics class that will confuse thousands of viewers. It also doesn't help to have a generic MacGuffin and a formulaic villain at the core of such an unconventional movie. In the end, Nolan isn't the ""savior of cinema"" (no one will be), but he certainly delivers the blockbuster everyone's been waiting for since the beginning of the year. As long as people are able to accept and enter his new world, Tenet will be received as one of the best films of 2020.Rating: A-"
2269,"Cool visuals, convoluted spy story, cheesy villiain and Sci fi elements are not as well thought out as I hoped they were."
2270,"The Movie depends on amazing idea but I am not sure the practice.
I like too many things on this movie but most of them sound mixing and set pieces which is directly belong to budget.
As an average viewer, Tenet includes too many ""what the .... "" scenes and they are too complicated for me. I missed too many things about Tenet, I have too many questions for the movie.
I liked and dislike the movie in the same time. But still, not sure what I liked or dislike."
2271,"For me this movie is a masterpiece, like Nolan's other movies.
To fully understand, I recommend the watch this movie a second time.
I very enjoyed to watch this movie in an imax theatre."
2272,"I did not understand what was happening at all, but Robert Pattinson is good looking lol"
2273,I feel that this is a 150 minutes of some sort of the most expensive holy-trash in the world. And I think nobody got it for real and those who say that the film is good they just whan to be in style.
2274,"He's done it again! A masterpiece. And like Interstellar, you either love it or just don't understand it."
2275,"As the title reads, another masterpiece by the master himself. Every film I've watched by Nolan has always left me feeling ecstatic. This one left me leaving the cinema a little confused but in a good & curious way. Watching TENET for me was like I've seen the a mathematical equation and the result of a equation, but I just needed to understand the formula. I've always prefered watching films that leave me wanting to 'understand them properly'...the soundtrack is on point as usual, the quality and feel of the film is fantastic and the stylish appearance of all the scenes, costumes etc. The script flows, everyone is cast well, nothing feels akward or cringey. Truly a master of his art Christopher Nolan is, have been awaiting this film and it didn't disappoint."
2276,I have to admit I had a problem with John David Washington. He wasn't good. He just didn't keep up with the A-list co-stars and it bothered me. In every scene he was I didn't feel anything. He looked in every scene like he was just trying to remember his lines. Wasn't a good casting choice.
2277,"Every actor got punched in the mouth,then given a chewingum and the director screamed cmon lets make a crazy movie! Cmon hurry up before your mouths heal! I dont want the audience to hear any word!
Lol"
2278,"The idea is quite genial.
The execution reminds me of what I experienced with Matrix back then. Something new, revolutionary somehow.
But the script is very confusing and the acting is unemotional, the pacing is difficult to follow, and I could not think to any most unpleasant actors than Washington and Pattinson (besides Nicolas Cage, the worst actor ever existed).
Pattinson is a mystery to me, I will never understand why he is allowed to act.
I find him extremely repelling, every time I see him I feel this impulse of punching him in the face. If I knew he was here I would have boycotted the movie, like I will with the new laughable Batman (seriously, Pattinson as Batman? What comes next, De Vito as Superman?).
Washington is an insignificant boring newbie with an unemotonal face, a B-Movie actor in the wrong movie.
Very bad casting. Also Branagh, I have seen him so many times in the role of the bad guy. It does not impress anymore.This movie with better protagonists and a more friendly pacing and script would be a masterpiece.
Currently it is just a failed beta."
2279,"Christopher Nolan may have out-Nolaned himself with Tenet. It has every element you've come to expect from a Nolan film, and some that you don't. Saw this last night in Imax and still can't quit processing it in my head. While admittedly confusing at times, the twists unfolded with such beautiful precision that somehow manage to blow your mind and send chills tingling down your spine at the same time. I can't wait for a second viewing to try and dissect more of the clues hidden throughout the film.I was disappointed that Zimmer couldn't compose for Tenet, as he is a true regular in Nolan's world. However, Ludwig Göransson did a more than admirable job laying out a tension filled score in his absence.Tenet is the rare film that has enough shock value and wow factor to truly inspire and leave its viewers in awe. Much like Inception, it requires the viewer's upmost attention and a second (and even third) viewing are likely to be just as exciting as the first as you figure out more and more. Tenet might not save movie theaters from extinction, but the experience we had seeing it perfectly illustrates why we would really be missing out if theaters start to close down throughout the world."
2280,"First watch: Really liked the movie, but didn't really understand it all. Gave it an 8/10.Second watch: Loved every minute. It all actually makes sense, the movie is extremely well thought out. Changed my rating to 10/10.Many people will criticize the movie for needing a second watch, but i think the rewatchability is partly what makes Nolan's movies great."
2281,"You have to watched it, at least two times, its incredible once you understand it... Thank you sir Nolan"
2282,Seriously if you didn't quite enjoy the first viewing go on youtube or reddit and check out plot breakdowns and go rewatch the film
2283,"I really wanted it to be good like the others by Nolan. It's not. Five stars are enough. Nolan already gave us superb films like The Prestige, Interstellar, Dunkirk and the masterpiece Inception; but now he really needs a pause and a better inspiration for the next film. Meanwhile we'll try to forget this faux pas."
2284,"I encourage everyone to watch the movie, it is one of the things that made me want to live more. I am a person who is barely enjoy anything but this movie blew my mind. I onow there would be low critics but I am sure they didn't understand the movie. Anyway, if u love time travel, physics and quantum mechanics this movie will captivate u. One more thing that took my heart away is the music it gave an exceptional experience I never hade before with any movie. Finally, I will not compare it with other Nolan's Movies because Nolan is trying to employ wonderful ideas on each movie so the comparison is completely unfair."
2285,"A film that is sure to age like fine wine. Ten years down the line this will be talked about like it deserves, but Tenet (2020) is in it for the long game, have no doubt. It's a film that taps into Christopher Nolan's main focus in all of his films, in perhaps the least metaphorical way yet - TIME - whilst before he could only mess with time in his films in the editing room, now Nolan has been given a chance to alter time in a way that allows his characters to actually perceive it just like the audience unlike Memento (2000) or The Prestige (2006.) I'm sure he had fun with that. As will any audience member, even ones that don't love the plot or the characters must appreciate the spectacle of this film and the work that went into it. Simply breathtaking.The 'inversion' plot item is original and a breath of fresh air for any genre but especially something like the spy/espionage genre which Nolan really has a go with. Washington and Pattinson are great in the lead performances and have great chemistry. At first it may seem like they are bland characters but in truth in the end (No Spoilers) their relationship and the deep humanity of the characters on screen is revealed, it is clear their original blank canvas personalities were on purpose and their development, for the first time in film history works backwards, and in context with the backwards run of the inversion technology in mind, this could genuinely be perceived as genius writing from Nolan. Not that that's uncommon from the guy.
Go watch it. (If it's safe to.)"
2286,"What a Masterpiece. I ...I just can't. My head.
If you like Nolan GO WATCH IT!"
2287,"TENET is a film out of this world, it's like it was written and made in the future and this is one if its travels back in to the past.
Everything a film should own to be perfect , you can find it in TENET, story, atmosphere, music, action, drama, love, hate, mystery, technology, unpredictability, filmography, lights, sounds, dialogues, acting.
This is my number 1 movie of all time\all genres.
I wish the best of the best to Mr. Nolan and all the crews that made this miracle happen. Thank you for this unique piece of ART"
2288,Great to witness Christopher Nolan's yet another masterpiece.TENET will keep you off the edge. Can you catch up with it?
2289,"I think people just don't want to understand this movie. They would rather be spoon fed their story from the buffet that is Disney and Marvel. I couldn't look away, and keeping up with the plot is deliciously mind bending, i couldn't wait to go back for a second watch.
The audio is too loud, but that's the only merit these bad reviews carry."
2290,"So if for humans, an increasing entropy means growing older (or moving 'forward' in time or, if you will, getting 'disorganized'), Nolan perhaps thought that reversing it to decreasing entropy by having his movie's characters enter certain devices would mean growing younger (or going 'back' in time). I could freeze my body and 'slow down' the entropy but the freezing would hardly make me younger. Apart from the fact that Robert Pattinson is a terrible actor and the other guy was also nothing special, there were many plot holes even if we accept the idea that one could go in the opposite direction (I.e. back in time) if they reversed their entropy, for example, why were objects such as cars moving backward with them if they did not enter the said devices with those objects? Why did fire become ice? Why were they able to see other objects in the 'past' normally? Did they take the sunlight with them along with the oxygen masks? Sorry, Nolan, this one was not good."
2291,"It will be confusing at the start and till the half time your mind may start giving up on trying to understand the scenes, dialogues and everything happening on the screen. But have patience for an hour and witness the unfolding of all the events in the most jaw dropping Nolan style of filmmaking. You will thank yourself for having faith in the legendary director. #Mind blown."
2292,Not for all people it is a complete puzzle that unfold throughout the movie
2293,"Christopher NOLAN has run out of ideas. He now has to resuscitate concepts that are twenty years' old in order to keep his career going rather than retire from being a creative himself and then to produce the works of the next generation of film directors.The rampant egomania and intellectual arrogance here is emotionally depressing and distinctly un-entertaining as we witness an above-average talent reduced to hack work.The characterisation is poor, the ideas ridiculous and the cast not always well-chosen. But the biggest problem is a script which gives little for the actors to do to enable them to breathe life into their characters. This lack of any possibility for audience identification leaves us with a psychologically-barren spectacle which occurs for no really-valid reason.A waste of time."
2294,"I saw Tenet in IMAX today.
I had the biggest smile on my face for 2.5 hours straight!
It was released in India today, months after the worldwide release, so maybe they have fixed the sound problem that everyone is talking about. It didn't have any such problems in India.
The plot was not at all hollow. It's just that people are focusing too much on the catchy inverse time stuff (which was mind blowing by the way). The plot was deep and it just requires a relaxed mind to catch up. The characters were as deep as they needed to be. This is not a character-driven movie. It is plot-driven. No complaints there. The music was amazing too!
To the haters, I say-
It is a bit heavy on the brain, but why do you have to understand every intricate plot detail then and there in the 2.5 hours runtime? There are too many plot points. Just focus on the important ones and give in. Sit back and feel the movie. The movie will automatically bring you to the edge of the seat.Overall, I had a wonderful experience with this movie, and will definitely re-watch it!"
2295,"So guys the wait is over as we come across another much awaited Sci-fi thriller from Mr. Nolan, the Tenet which is a inversion itself of the number TEN read same from both sides.
I can understand why even critics are not on board with this one as it never gives enough time nor possible explanation to the audiences to fully immerse in the experience and Appreciate the beauty of it all. I have watched it twice as of now and can say with confidence that this is his best work since Inception. Not only he plays with time here as we saw in The Interstellar (2014) but creates a new ground of reality altogether. A lot of exposition thrown at you with a whole lot of Jargons to follow which are explained so fast that you can't even blink your eye and I am serious ( so much for Tight editing 😁).
The film is visually a treat and as we all know Mr. Nolan has a habit of using Real props and strict NO for CGI, the end result is just mesmerizing. The scenes shot in Mumbai with Dimple Kapadia's Priya are just pure fun and captivating. In short you need to feel it rather understand it (It literally tells you in the beginning of the film).
Even Narcissistic men can't possibly decode this unsolvable possible in one go let alone the others.
The soundtrack is not by Hans Zimmer this time due to some Pre scheduled work, but Mr. Ludwig Göransson is simply apt for the movie and adds to the already tension filled environment with a penace.
John David Washington and Robert Pattinson both have done some extraordinary work both mentally and physically doing their own stunts and whatnot.
I promise you this, you haven't seen anything like this before even if Don't understand everything at once 😂. But once you do, you will not be able to stop gloating about it. See for yourself in an IMAX theatre near you for a enriched experience.VERDICT: 4.5/5"
2296,"You can't say anything bad about this movie, amazing directed,and cast we're well selected and they done the job perfectly"
2297,"In my opinion, Tenet has done something special here. visually it gives something to the audience that, in my opinion, has never been there in history of cinema. when the movie is over, you have this feeling as if you jumped out of the plane. full of emotions and adrenaline.Film score is freaking brilliant. acting of all of the main actors, John David Washington,Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki and Kenneth Branagh were all at top of their acting form.the script is not the director's best but still pretty good.
the only regret that is left for me about this movie is that I didn't see this film in cinema and big picture.Solid 9/10."
2298,"People complaint about The Prestige telling audience everything without having them think after watching it.Tenet was out and people complaint that they hadn't got it after watching it.If someone gave a low score because of that, they had better rate themselves instead of the movie. Them can't call a piece of art a garbage cause they don't understand it.In my opinion, it's way easier to under than Memento. I understand it at least 80% at I first watch (with subtitle and quite a lot of pause). I understand why so many people didn't. The movie pace is quite fast and the information all comes from dialogue. But at least trying to figure out rather than giving a bad review straight away. After trying, if it still doesn't make sense, go ahead and give you score.Nolan team made a film that is unique to any others and it's precious. But clearly people nowadays only like some easy fun movies like Marvel's."
2299,Christopher Nolan é um diretor que não cansa de me surpreender! Esse é mais um trabalho extraordinário desse diretor que junta os requintes de um 007 com zoar a teoria da relatividade! Se você também é fã de viagem no tempo não pode perder!!! Nota DEZ! Christopher Nolan is a director who never tires of surprising me! This is another extraordinary work by this director who joins the refinements of a 007 with making fun of the theory of relativity! If you are also a fan of time travel you can't miss it !!! SCORED! #movieslover #christophernolan #tenet
2300,My iq dropped to a subzero level. You literally need to prepare for it.
2301,"Your game of hide and seek before the premiere was really worthy of all honor. But the height of the fall increased with the anticipation. It was great fun to follow the, as always, terrific story. Intelligent, exciting, unpredictable. In terms of craftsmanship, you have delivered another masterpiece. The subject of inversion is new to this extent, even if TIME is almost always the focus of their attention. You have built in many attempts at explanation, unfortunately with little success. I think of the two bullets on the table. Illogical. The cuts were often much too hard: just half-frozen to death CUT already awake at the other end of the world. That would have been the chance to develop the characters. What do I know about the protagonist? His past, his quirks, his passions, his weaknesses ... nothing. Instead, we're chasing after a McGiuffin called an algorithm. Meh. So all that remains is the suspension of disbelief. An Englishman as a Russian oligarch, great. An ex-vampire plays right, well, the only one who apparently knows what the movie is about. Ms. Debecki was convincing, but she had exactly the same role in THE NIGHT MANAGER. Ludwig Göransson's music is great, rarely have scenes been so well supported and amplified. A film definitely for the big screen. First seven stars, as always with your films, Mr. Nolan, I'll have to see him more often. Thank you, Mr. Nolan, you are not making it easy for me ..."
2302,"The movie is a mystery. A mystery which you don't care. The most exciting thing about this movie is you, excited something big will happen but nothing happens.Didn't Endgame cleared many confusions that the world won't end if you meet your own past form. Nolan why did you buy drugs from Rhea? She mixes Rat poison in it to increase quantity and profits from it.
Even her brother and dad are drug dealers! Plz if you wanna buy drugs, buy it from Sasta Tarantino(Anurag Kashyap) or Suara or RGV. Just don't get too close to them!"
2303,"A real mind bender. The main storyline is made easy to follow but the reasons behind why and how it all happens is a little tricky. Just ensure that you can understand foreign accents. Particularly Russian and muffled voices. It might pay to sit closer to the speakers.The soundtrack is pretty epic, too. Oh, and the fight scene with the grater... Ouch!"
2304,"I have never watched a Nolan film once. It really defeats the purpose of the underlying and rather complicated concepts that he presents which begs for a second or third viewing. Some of us do not have the ability to grasp the full context of the film unless we have access to the script. I am not asking for a scientifically accurate explanation. I do not require that of other movies or books. I want to be entertained, and that is what I paid for and received in abundance. Yes, the soundtrack is a little distracting. Try screening the score separately. Tenet will be recognized for its place in filmmaking soon enough."
2305,MIND BLOWING MOVIE!! Gonna have to watch it again and again in the theaters!!
2306,"I went into the theatre expecting a transformative experience from TENET and Christopher Nolan, of whom I am a huge fan. But by the end of the movie I was compelled to search online for a quote that turned out to be from Shakespeare's Macbeth - ""Life's but a walking shadow; a poor player, that struts and frets his hour upon the stage, and then is heard no more: it is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.""This is a harsh judgement, I know, but despite the great visual effects, and the exciting action scenes that have raised the bar for these types of movies higher and higher, I left the theatre quite unmoved emotionally by the film.By the way, despite the Shakespeare quote, I do not in anyway want to suggest that I think Christopher Nolan is 'an idiot'. Far from it. There is no doubt that Nolan is at the top of his game, but I found the film hard to follow, and like many other reviewers much of the dialogue hard to understand (because many key scenes had actors talking while wearing headgear that muffled their voices to the point of unintelligibility).Going into the theatre I thought that if the film was all I hoped it would be, I would return for a second or even third look (which I did for the Joker movie). While it might be good to do this - if only to try and understand those parts of the film I missed - right now I don't think I can be bothered."
2307,"Chris Nolan tries to bend our mind again! (I am neither a critic nor an expert cinephile who has guts and knowledge to decide how far Nolan could do it this time)What a sophistication he crafted with a whole new concept - time inversion.
For about 2 hrs, time seemed like a tangible dimension we can play with. I am satisfied with the ending too."
2308,"I'm kind of at a loss here. I did like the film. It was well wade made, had a good premise, great acting, great action....but I also have to admit how utterly confused I was. Like, I had no problem with Nolan's other sci-fi works like Inception and Interstellar but this one was tough to follow. It wasnt even so much the science aspect, it was just keeping track of characters and the missions. I felt like those other films in question did a better job of establishing characters. And not just establishing characters, but a better sense of team. We follow John David Washington the whole time, but so many other characters just drop in and out randomly (or are just glorified 5 min cameos) that it was just hard to keep track. I did ask myself about 1 1/2 hour in the film ""How did John's character meet Robert's character? I forget"". Or the very end mission, they are basically split into 2 groups and i understood what Elizabeth Debicki's character was doing, but the other team I had to ask myself ""And what are they doing in all of this, again?"". I dunno, I just think the film could have done a better job explaining. And I do want to see the film again (though probably not again until its out on bluray/digital), but I think it also makes it hard to rate the film now. On one hand, I feel like rating the film a 6 is offensive. I dont think its a bad film, far from it. And theres a lot to like. But at the same time, I feel like rating it a 7 might be too high considering its not too concise. Even though I will re-watch, I dont think you should have to watch a film more than once to understand it. A film should tell you what you need to know the first time."
2309,"The film is once again a Nolan High Concept film. You have to first of all pay full attention, keep your phone off and don't plan on bathroom breaks. This film is being derided by those who want to not have to think while watching and that's a shame. If you enjoy a film that will make you both pay attention and think, this is for you. There are so many hints and Easter eggs that Allude to the plot to come that are clearer in a second and third viewing. The concept and lore are riveting and the acting superb. There isn't much humor here, it isn't Marvel. Go in with the attitude of a bourne film and the tone will resonate better.The film hinges on you being able to feel through it and let it roll with you while thinking.Plan to see it twice.One negative, the sound mix isn't the best, could be the theatre I attended or just an immersion choice.Overall, a superb film but you can't lazily shut your brain off while watching and that won't be for everyone"
2310,"Nolan's movie, even against his own body of work, eclipses them in terms of scale and theme with a new look on time travel no one would have predicted. From the get go you are pulled in, lost in its world, with your own time fluctuating as you stare on, captivated. The movie really has to be experienced and my is it one, but go in with an empty mind and open heart and you won't be disappointed, though the dialogue and music mix sometimes make it's hard to discern dialogue but my hearing sucks and the strong world and character building allow you to fill in small blanks and do not detract from the experience. It's been a rough time this past six months, indulge yourself and watch this movie"
2311,"Christopher Nolan delivers a draw-dropping spectacle. Tenet is a visual masterpiece accompanied by an amazing score by Ludwig Goransson. The acting is also very well done by everyone involved. Besides visuals and sound, this film very much depends on its complex plot revolving around time and ""inversion"". If you thought Inception was complicated, this will be an overwhelming movie to watch. Personally, I found myself trying to play catch-up with this movie, and just as I was starting to understand something that happened 15 minutes ago, there's something totally different unraveling onscreen, and I just couldn't keep up. The sound mix is also configured to a point where the dialogue is virtually incomprehensible without subtitles. With a film that depends heavily on its plot, its important to be able to hear the exposition when every word is necessary for the audience understand. I found that not being able to understand the plot significantly lowered the stakes for me. With Inception, the stakes were simple: if you die in a dream, you go into limbo. In Tenet, however, time is so complex and confusing that it is hard to understand what the goal of the mission is and who is at stake. The movie tells me everyone is at stake, but I just didn't feel it because I couldn't quite understand it. There is some great moments of foreshadowing that make you think back to earlier in the movie and connect the dots, which is neat. This is definitely a movie that will become more understandable and enjoyable after multiple viewings, similar to lots of Nolan films. I will definitely be getting the blu-ray so I can witness the beautiful sound and images put on display in Tenet... and turn on subtitles. 8/10"
2312,"As a very big Nolan fan, I had extremely high expectations for this film going in. The movie started off with a bang, but the dialogue was pretty bland in the sense that it was trying to set the plot but was doing a terrible job with very sophisticated ideas thrown at you too fast for you to soak in. Beginning of the movie was very hard to understand and frankly I was very confused until about halfway in ( the very loud music and loud action scenes made it very hard to hear much of the dialogue throughout the movie)
Things got very interesting halfway through and I really began to get comfortable with the plot and sophisticated ideas when even MORE extremely detailed plot points appeared.
Too much details at the wrong points had me very confused by much of the movie.
But despite all this, even the amount of information that I soaked in on the first watch told me how great this movie really could be if watched properly. Even though some aspects were hard to keep up with, I would hardly call myself disappointed. This movie has much potential with brilliant ideas and just needs to be watched correctly. When understood properly, the true genius of Nolan can be seen."
2313,"Tenet is the film that proves that Christopher Nolan is, without a doubt, the most original, exciting and ambitious filmmaker currently working today.You have to respect the man, because he clearly has a vision; and in my eyes, his vision came to life with Tenet. It is a film that prides itself in the cinematic experience; it's more than just a trip to the cinema, it's an utterly compelling 150 minutes that engulfs you into another world. One of Nolan's ultimate purposes as a filmmaker is to have his audience immersed in a completely different world - and in the case of Tenet, it's a twilight world of espionage and time inversion.As written above, Tenet is a wildly original film, loaded with mind-bending concepts and fascinating ideas. It's a story where the audience can quickly get lost and disoriented, so Nolan's solution for this are the two-dimensional characters. Many have criticised Tenet for its uninteresting characters, however this was intentional by Nolan, and I believe that it is a strength rather than a weakness of the film. This is because the archetypal characters serve as the familiar anchor that the audience latches on to, as they experience a world they've never seen before.What I love about Nolan's films is that he often expresses ideas through the nature of the story or world; in the case of Tenet, Nolan explores the theme of fate - a theme that is inextricably linked to the nature of time travel, or rather Time Inversion. Throughout the film, there is a constant question of whether or not our actions are predetermined or if we have the potential to carve our own fate. As the story progresses, the Protagonist learns of the unfortunate reality that ""what's happened, happened"", realising that he is not in the complete control of his fate that he thought he once had. The expression of this theme feels so organic in Tenet because the story is built on the concept of time inversion, a concept that has a close connection with the film's main theme: fate.Is the film flawless? No. The dialogue is a bit clunky at times, to the point where you can tell that the characters on-screen are also getting tired at the exposition. The dialogue brings me on to the sound mixing: there were a handful of lines that I simply did not hear - even after a second viewing. It's something common in Nolan's films that I guess one has to get used to.Another possible flaw is the complexity of the film; on my first viewing I didn't fully understand it, but I did comprehend it to a point where I could feel the ratcheting tension and gargantuan spectacle that the scenes were conveying. On my second viewing, I understood a bit more (with the help of some YouTube videos). It made me realise that the complexity of the film isn't a flaw. Whether or not you fully understand time inversion doesn't make the freeway scene any less brilliant. So to surmise, the complexity of the film isn't a flaw in my view, as long as the audience feels something emotionally.Tenet is escapist cinema at its finest; Nolan clearly has the intention of immersing his audience in this twilight world - and he does more than just succeeding with Tenet. It's a film beset with enrapturing concepts, unbelievable spectacle and stimulating ideas, a film that represents the unfiltered vision of one Christopher Nolan."
2314,"Very hard to gather all information and secret elements in the movie. When you watch the movie, no distraction and focus! Worth every second of your time, amazing movie!"
2315,"Tenet was written and directed by Christopher Nolan and tells the story of ""The Protagonist"" a secret agent who has been tasked with trying to prevent world war 3. This is the absolute bare bones synopsis of what this story entails. As just like with Christopher Nolan's previous projects this one has a lot going on.I want to start off by saying Nolan is a filmmaker who I have had a lot of respect for over his career, a filmmaker working within the studio formula but still being able to make wholly original movies. He always manages to bring something new to the table and Tenet is no exception. This movie left quite an impression on me and even almost a week after seeing it, I still notice myself wondering about how this film even exists. Just like with Inception and Memento, Nolan's previous mind bending pieces, Trying to imagine this movie in script form and imaging Nolan having to explain to his cast and crew, it must of been difficult to get the crew entirely on Board with the concept at play here and I have nothing but respect for someone who is not afraid to really think outside the box and Nolan most certainly does just that.From a genre point of view Tenet is Christopher Nolan's take on classic spy thrillers, characters like James bond and Jason Bourne and the worlds they inhabit. with their fast cars, supermodel women, sharp suits and exotic countries. this movie has all of that but rather than relish in all those things, the movie is more interested in exploring unique concepts to tell the story. The way that Tenet handles these unique concepts is nothing short of stunning. There are some set pieces in this movie that will leave you speechless, Nolan use of practical effects and stunts make for some awe-inspiring moments that we don't just get enough of in movies nowadays.Are main stars John David Washington, Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki all did fantastic jobs with what they are given with Debicki being my favourite performance. They are not particularly developed characters which I have heard some people take issue with. And whilst I do agree maybe a little more backstory for these characters would have helped the film, I did not find myself to bothered by it. Nolan has always been a concept guy over a character guy so it is almost something I come to expect at this point. However, I will admit that some of the dialogue did feel a little clunky and there were some really on the nose lines of dialogue that a felt a little cheesy even for Nolan's standards.One thing I was concerned about going in was the lack of Hans Zimmer. Zimmer and Nolan together are as iconic as bread and butter. Fortunately, I am happy to report that Ludwig Goransson's was great and a highlight of the movie, albeit a little overused. There were several scenes where I felt the music did not really add much and could have been taken out altogether which ironically is something that I have always appreciated about Nolan in past films. On the flip side the music combined with some of the more action-oriented scenes made for some truly pulse raising movie magic. Including the opening sequence which was fantastic.I think that Where this movie suffers the most is its first act. A very choppy, messy and convoluted act that on first viewing did have me a little concerned. The problem is the movie needs to throw a lot of crucial information at its audience for later reveals to have the payoff they deserve and at times it can be a little tiresome. Once you get passed all that and get into the meat of the movie the momentum really picks up and once it does pick up it never really slows back down, but it's just that first hour that really hurts the pacing. There are also some issues with audio mixing I noticed. A lot of dialogue was missed on my first viewing thanks to music or sound effects being too loud. As the film progresses it does seem to improve but it is still can be very distracting at times.
Overall, this is another great addition to the Nolan filmography. It is not his best but certainly not his worst and a pretty great movie to go along with the reopening of cinemas. Oh, and if you can watch this movie in Imax, it is absolutely worth it.
8/10"
2316,"Film starts great, but all the build up to a massive action scene and then .... the movie switches state, it becomes slower and the music not as bombastic, its was entertaining, but I had enough of the main villian and subplot, which was in my view, simply boring.Didnt really care much for Neil to warrant any thoughts towards his character, the protagonist was the only notable watchable and root for character out of them all.Im sure the film needs another watch and maybe Im missing something, but unfortunately I cared very little about all but the antagonist.The reversing of scenes did, after a while, become extremely boring apart from the car chase.The music was great and bombastic, but sometimes completely detracted from the speech - was good though"
2317,"Worth going back to the cinemas, brilliantly convulated!"
2318,"The movie that has absolutely everything, except a running commentary so you can understand what on earth is going on! It was also way too loud at 109 decibels at one point. Loved the concept. Definitely worth a socially distanced trip to the cinema."
2319,"When the credits started rolling all I could say was ""I have no idea what just happened, but I loved it"". Don't watch this later in the evening, you will have trouble sleeping! I still don't know if the story really makes sense, but the visuals are something we've never seen before! The score is brilliant too, almost happy Hans Zimmer was too busy"
2320,Its kinda confusing at first but in the end it wraps it all up. The idea was so cool and it had pretty good music its one of his good movies. I think its a little underrated.
2321,"Christopher Nolan long ago established himself as one of the best film makers around. Tenet further cements his legacy as the smartest blockbuster director in Hollywood.
The film itself is set around JDW, ""The Protagonist"" who after a botched job, becomes aware of bigger things happening in the world that will affect the past, present & future. That's all I'll say about the plot as it's too complex to elaborate on.
The postives are that the cast are brilliant especially Robert Pattinson & Elizabeth Debicki whose charm and wit provide humanity to the story. But the film really shines when its action sequences take place. They are truly stunning, nolan has redefined what we think an action sequence should look like, they are unlike anything you've seen before. The cinematography is amazing, often with the camera letting you view the action from every angle. The downside is that when the film slows down, you start thinking about the plot which becomes more confusing as film progresses. It has similarities to Looper & Inception in tone, plot & style. Some people may be frustrated with not being able to understand it but if you can try and keep up it will be a terrific, visually mind blowing cinematic experience. See it in IMAX."
2322,This is now my new favorite Nolan movie. This movie is a must-see
2323,This film is so confusing after the film finished I was still thinking what had I just watched. From the ending of the film I think there should be a second one but since there are so many bad reviews they probably won't make another one.
2324,"Sometimes I wish that director Christopher Nolan would go back (no pun intended) and make a straight forward movie, that doesn't evolve around the concept of time.Yes, people will be scratching their heads with this one, too, like they did with Memento, Inception, Interstellar and Dunkirk.It's all very visual and loud of course and he is a master at creating setpieces.Oddly enough I was most intrigued by the side story of the arm dealers wife. Maybe because it was the most linear.'Tenet' isn't scored by Nolan's usual collaborator, Hans Zimmer, which is a shame. There isn't a single melody in the movie. Only experimental synth sounds and strange sound bites.All the actors involved do a great job."
2325,Tenet is good; teneT is even better. It is highly recommended to watch the movie backwards.
2326,This movie follow a person who is as unknown of the story as we is watching. As you go with him on this crazy journey we understand at the same timme he does! A Main character that we feels like us when watching as we were there experience it with him. I don't want to spoil the movie but he is more important that he does understand and the other characters are there simply as a reminder for that.
2327,"If you're looking to watch a marvel fantasy movie obviously this isn't going to be that. On the other other hand if you want a non stop, greatly acted, scripted, shot movie with a story line that I'm still thinking about two days later then it's a must see. My only problem is Washington is a little bit too small to be as tough as he is. Apart from that it's just amazing. Work of art. Then there's the score. This is a movie. Just go and see it. The ending is also great. Perfectly executed. Take (another) bow Nolan. ( oh if Robert Patterson can repeat his performance in the batman. What a casting choice that was !!!)"
2328,"Tenet is another very solid product from Christopher Nolan.
For me it sits around the mid tier of his catalogue (which means it's pretty damn good), but it was definitely his most exposition heavy and coldest work to date - you don't really connect with the characters on any level until perhaps the very end.
That being said, the entire concept of the film is extraordinarily creative and made for a fascinating ride. The way Nolan incorporates the temporal elements of the story into the action was an absolute spectacle on the big screen and when the film started to connect the dots in the second half of the runtime, I was completely engaged.
Pattinson was an absolute scene stealer, and Washington and Branagh were both pretty great in their roles too (John David Washington sounds exactly like his father - close your eyes and you'll hear a young Denzel). I also had no idea Aaron Taylor-Johnson was in this, but I thought he turned in a pretty good performance.
The visual effects and sound design are astonishing, but the ADR was pretty wonky to say the least. I honestly couldn't hear 20-30% of the dialogue in the film and the people I saw the movie with had the same issue. I'm also seeing from other reviewers now that this seems to be a common criticism across the board.
Overall, Tenet is a very solid original film with plenty to offer and is definitely worth seeing at the cinema, although I don't feel the need to immediately re-watch it like I did with some of Nolan's previous films."
2329,After watching this movie. I understand this Topic Sentence in the trailer. 😂
2330,"Its gonna take a while to recover from tenet. i got nolaned folks! it was an overall great movie. the acting, the plot, the directing, the cinematography and visuals, and the music was fantastic. i personally think it was one of his best. it was a lot like inception but in the best way possible."
2331,There is a whole lot to digest and unpack. I love how it makes you think. Still trying to figure it out but I highly recommend it.
2332,Alright to out it straight theres no way you will understand everything the first time you watch it it messes with your head in a good way id say this movie is definitely Top 5 nolan movies
2333,"Speaking as a huuuge Chris Nolan fan, I was quite unsatisfied with the beginning of the film. It seams slow, boring and simple.....the rest of the movie isnt that simpleNolan makes you think that you can't be fooled, he makes you believe that your own genius is beyond the imagination of any director in the world.If you are aware of whats happening right now in the movie, you are unaware for all the stuff which will explode your mind just 10 minutes away.If someone would ask me, ""what is this movie about?""
My answer would be: YesAfter the second or third time watching this movie, my rating will probably go up"
2334,"Well,well,well..what can i say..let's just say from now this is a great movie,worth watching,and worth analyzing..lol.
the opening scene was intense and thrilling.you don't actually get what's happening until later in the movie.
it reminded me of Memento you know because of time and stuff,but there nothing alike.
the cinematography was on point and the soundtraks they made me hyped in every scene,but in some parts of the movie were too loud that you couldn't hrear what there saying.but it wasn't big of a problem.
overall this movie is a must-see if you are a christopher nolan fan."
2335,"Well, I didn't understand the beginning, the middle, or the end, but the film-making was excellent."
2336,I feel you need to be high to enjoy this mambo jumbo mesh of nothingness. Most boring and senseless movie of the year. Not to mention Robert Patison emotes like a worm. He's so wormy. Denzel's son (what's his name again?) did a good job but did they have to bring an actress taller than the CN tower to compliment him? He looked like a dwarf. Ok back to the movie...? That's all I have to say.No clue what was going on and had to leave. So boring.
2337,"It is a masterpiece!A brilliant and original concept for a action sci-fi movie, packed with a marvelous soundtrack (one of the best I have ever heard), great acting and characters that you feel for, innovative fights and good special fx that are a part of the story."
2338,"Has not a good brain (or has only seen it 1 time).
With the time people will realize that this is a genius movie."
2339,"It is an entertaining watch; it will give you great adrenaline rush. It is a thriller till the end. All that's good. But in spite of it, the film ends up being more of an action film like James Bond. It is very difficult to emotionally connect with any of the characters. And, like almost always, Nolan sucks at creating rounded relatable women characters.
Cliché female lead plus the most obvious kind of Russian villain, topped with a hero with a swagger. Add to it a dash of science fiction. And voila, you have 'Tenet'!
I do not think the story line is difficult to follow for any moderately observant and attentive viewer. What I don't like is how the film appears to want to bamboozle and befuddle you and act too smart, if you know what I mean.
Loud, explosive scenes which seem like a globetrotting adventure travelogue sewn together. One mission follows close at the heels of another like some video game. With plane crashes and countless explosions, it is a big spectacle which I personally found empty of enough substance. But keeping all this aside, it's definitely fun to watch. Once."
2340,2020 is the dubious year for the world where we are witnessing unexpected twist and turns. TENET is one such twist and turn in cinema history which is going to shape it's future to come and will be setting a new zoner of film making.
2341,"I have 15 minutes left to watch and yet I still feel it's time to have my say.
I just never got this film from the start to quote a number of reviews the actors dialogue is extremely hard to hear they do mumble and the background audio is loud and unnecessary way too much.Why should I have to watch it twice or three times if I'm going to watch a movie again it's because I enjoyed it not because I want my brain fried and my ears straining"
2342,In first time you would bit disappointed but to understand it you have to watach second time and the amazing thing that you are not going to bore in second watch and big thumbs up to nolan sir & robert pattinson and grate cinematic experience but the sound mixing is little bit dizzy
2343,"Like the other Nolan's movie, its always not easy to understand. But it seems the most hard for me to understand. May be some people gonna watch it for the second time to try to collect the missing puzzle. But i dont know, i dont have the desire to watch for the second time in this movie (?) I dont get the kick in this movie"
2344,"It's a pretty solid concept but the execution leaves you unsatisfied. I liked that it had a different perspective on time travel, fight scenes look good and well made. Robert Pattison, even though I was skeptic about it, did a very good job, you can say that he's determined to not be remembered as that sparkling guy.
I didn't like that the movie had to cling on to so many cliches to make a story and make you care about it. So russian man is ruthless bad guy, the one woman is a slightly updated (but not too much that she can actually handle anything without getting emotional and messing it up, god forbid) maiden in distress, the protagonist is a guy whose only characteristics are being good and american. This is a very good example of how you can mix every single cinema cliche in one single film.The movie is also very fast paced, and every single dialogue counts. If you miss one you won't understand what's happening in the rest of the movie, period. I wish it was a tad slower - and I'm saying this as someone who enjoys fast paced works- so that we could kind of digest what happened and prepare for what will happen next. Because a lot happens in this movie... a lot. Editing is also a bit disjointed for my taste.It's also very action-heavy with exploding this and shooting up that every other minute. It's almost like someone had a good idea, then it got butchered and hollywood-ized.Overall it is watchable, it does make you curious because of the concept, and doesn't really beat around the bush, but it doesn't give you a lot either."
2345,Storyline was hard to understand but visuals were good
2346,This could have been a masterpiece. Concept is original and fresh take on time travel. Action scenes and big budget effects are there. Acting is good. But the exposition and plot was hard to follow so I was lost and had no clue what was going on. But it's good if you don't think too hard and just know who's the good guy and bad guy and the basic gist is they're trying to stop a time travel weapon. I find Nolan's recent films hard to understand. Memento Batman Inception are great and I can understand. Interstellar and Tenet are a tad beyond my intellectual reach but that's not to say others won't enjoy this and you have to respect original stories which is so rare nowadays. This is definitely a novel take on time travel. Other time travel movies I enjoyed more are Edge of Tomorrow and Predestination but this one is a fresh take with backwards time travel.
2347,"Right off the bat, there's a scene where a room full of people are sitting in a auditorium, people are shooting into the crowd, missing all the people, but hitting the chairs, really? Then random bullets hitting surfaces all around the protagonist yet he's far away from the action doesn't make any sense. Then protagonist is about to get his hand hit with a hammer, what does he do???? Move his hand. Because a bad guy will let you do that so you can save your hand. Stupid. This movie is like a less than entertaining inception that's even more confusing. I don't see the hype with this movie. It's not that good."
2348,"I stopped trying to understand the mechanism of the inversion and instead just enjoyed the intriguing plot line, the delicious score, the amazing practical effect, the glorious cgi effect. Ah nolan you did it again you!
Though I'll admit halfway through I almost quit because it felt convoluted but BAM finally things are getting interesting and I am glad I didn't quit.
Was this his masterpiece? Probably not, but I'll say this movie is a masterpiece at its genre and one that you would not want to miss. My only regret is that I streamed it instead of watching it on the cinema, as Im sure the experience will be wholly elevated. Alas covid 19 and whatnot, one is grateful enough to get to enjoyed this brilliant movie."
2349,"I wanted to rate it 9 but first we must think that this kind of story which is fresh and new, and camera work, editing, and Nolan's own direction deserves a little bit more attention. Wow just wow, what a beautiful movie it is."
2350,"Do you like Christopher Nolan because of the Dark Knight trilogy? You will find Tenet confusing.Do you like Christopher Nolan because of Memento or Interstellar? You will find Tenet needlessly action-packed.Yet this film is better than what many people claim, as long as you set your expectations right.Nolan is facing a paradox by trying to please two types of movie crowds that don't have much in common, and Tenet is the culmination of this tension.Tenet is too complicated for the typical superhero movie fan. And contrary to what has been said, there is no information dump (""exposition"") in this film: the physics of time reversal are never clearly explained to viewers. Clues about the plot are revealed piece by piece. This makes the film even more challenging to grasp for the average moviegoer.Meanwhile, the film is aggressively fast-paced for an intellectual crowd. Like watching a video that you accidentally set at 1.25x speed on YouTube. You can get used to it, but something doesn't feel right. To the point that I seriously wonder about studio tampering. This movie was probably cut down from 3 hours to 2:30, would be my guess.Blowhards who review films often get Christopher Nolan wrong. The director usually devotes a lot of time to character development. Almost a full hour of Interstellar is spent on character building, with outstanding performances by McConaughey et al carrying the entire film. The relationship between Cobb and Mal takes centre stage in Inception, and there again, it is meticulously and masterfully developed. There is just none of that in Tenet. For the first time, it's true: there is not enough character development to really care about the relationships. The chemistry between Washington and Pattinson was perhaps the most promising one to exploit. Yet the pacing is too fast to really make it count.That being said, there are two reasons to watch Tenet if you haven't seen it.First, the central concept. If you liked Inception and Interstellar, you will find the scientific speculation in Tenet just as mind-bending. It's the type of film that will make you think for hours, if not days, especially once you find out that time-reversibility has a theoretical basis. Tenet has that kind of metaphysical power. Like too few artistic creations today, the film does not waste your time with irrelevant ideas.Second, the visuals are groundbreaking. The scenes in time reversal are unique in the history of cinema, as far as I can tell. As a result, it would not be honest to dismiss the importance of this film for the medium itself."
2351,"No spoilers here, we already know from the trailers that the movie is about time moving backward.In the movie, regardless of whether time in the environment is flowing forward or backward, we as audience are always following the protagonist's point-of-view, which is always going forward! What's there to be confused about? The usual fallacies in time travel, like time loops and paradoxes are discussed but entirely avoided in the movie!Furthermore, there are more than enough visual cues and expositions to let the audience know whether the protagonist is currently moving forwards or backwards. My only gripe is there being too much exposition! After the protagonist's recruitment, four full minutes of explanation of how time is flowing backward. After a confrontation in the middle of the movie, there are another four minutes of exposition. The climax of the movie begins with over three minutes of exposition of the plan! Unlike Memento (2000), there is no puzzle to piece together in Tenet, because the characters always explain everything in complete sentences without even trying to be mysterious!Tenet is one of those legends that takes one concept, then explore and extrapolate and exhaust everything possible with this new idea. Everyone learns basic geometry in middle school, and quoting Wikipedia's first paragraph on Euclidean Geometry: ""Euclid's method consists in assuming a small set of intuitively appealing axioms, and deducing many other propositions (theorems) from these."" Hundreds of theorems were derived from only five axioms! Such beauty! Tenet also reminds of the computer game ""Linelight"" (2017), which takes a glowing line of light moving in a one dimensional path, and turns it into an amazing puzzle-solving experience. I would love for more people to appreciate this masterpiece, but that wouldn't happen if people don't even bother to try."
2352,A bit confusing but verry good. need to watch it twice
2353,"I've been waiting all year to see Tenet and I was lucky enough to see it in our IMAX theatre in Melbourne. The film was full of amazing action and lots of reverse footage trickery but I really felt like there was a lot of unnecessary complexity (and macguffin chasing!) which ended up just making the movie longer.
Time paradoxes aside, the one big thing I think the movie was missing is heart. In the days since I saw it I've mulled this over, thinking of the parent/child emotional cores of both Inception and Interstellar and Tenet just comes up hollow.
It might be worth a rewatch just for the Easter eggs but I doubt I will look back on this film in years to come with the same fondness as Nolan's others."
2354,"It's been a week that I saw tenet. I don't know what to write in the review, so here is my honest opinion. I started with great hope( bcos Nolan). As the story moved forward, I started getting confused. I was trying to understand what the filmaker was trying to portray. But I failed. It's been a week and I still don't know what happened in the movie.
Generally, Nolan's movies have a certain panache or mystery around it. So you need to shut everything down to watch his movies. But this cuckoo flew over my head( pun intended)"
2355,"While the ""inverted time"" or moving in reverse, concept is quite fascinating, the plot is very muddled and convoluted, and the music is so overbearing, that it overpowers the dialogue which is irritating and hard to follow what's going on, since the film depends mainly on expositions. The characters are under developed which makes it hard to care for them or what they do. With almost 2h30m run-time, the movie could've take its time and flesh out, at least the lead characters, and also explored the relationship between Neil and The Protagonist. It'd have given the film more grounded aspect, plus their interactions is simply the best part of the movie given how charismatic they are.
Technically, the film is near-perfect; cinematography is terrific; the camera work is spot on, the lighting, color effects, framing altogether contribute to the film's visual mood. The score is also excellent; it elevates the action sequences and overall gives the film a really great cinematic atmosphere, but it's so loud at times, and you might want to keep a pair for ear plugs beside you, just in case.Visually, it's both stylish and beautiful, The spectacular landscapes, collosal set pieces and props, and all, are vibrantly displayed.The performances are good; John D. Washington did a good job in lead role, Robert Pattison continues to prove he's such a wonderful actor, and to some extent, he outperform his co-star. Kenneth Branagh is very convincing in his role, and Elizabeth Debicki is arresting.
All in all, TeneT is visually impressive film, shot with great skill and vision, packed with action and convincing cast performances."
2356,"The underlying concept and fantasy is good, old and playable. However, not too sure if the films, believable pseudo reality has any physical value. The concept of time and space although directional can be placed into a looping fantasy, but good god Nolan has to get the pseudo physics right. If reversal of entropy is in play, everything should and must be in play similarly, including breathing, !I don't want to be fed a dream, that conflicts even as a fantasy; Shabby physics, that got away with the Nolan brand."
2357,"Christopher Nolan is usually one of my favorite film directors, but his films tend to rely on a high concept gimmick, and the characters are secondary, poorly fleshed out, but it doesn't matter if the concept is well done enough of an idea to keep you intrigued. This time ""inception"" idea is harder to convey than dreams within a dream, so It was mostly confusing most of the time, cause and effect of a reverse time line break all intuitive sense when you have cross interaction between them.On top of this you have the problem of very bland characters who seem like fill ins, stereotypical cartoon russian villian, a treacherous damsel, straight man simp protagonist, and so you really have no investment in this side winning at all, it would almost be more interesting if they lost, and based on the story, it maybe necessary for them to eventually lose to save humanity. So the film fails in giving you a reason to care, and is more riddle than story."
2358,"Tenet is the ne of the best Scifi genre movie
Good casting
Must watch"
2359,"Similar vibe
Similar technical plot
But it just doesn't work the way it did.John David Washington is no Leo
Robert Pattinson is no Gordon-Levitt
Elizabeth Debicki is no Marion
Dimple Kapadia is no Watanabe
Kenneth Branagh as a Russian villain is very underwhelmingMichael Caine , IS Michael Caine but he can't carry the movie on his own can he?
The cinematics are Inception like but it really isn't enough."
2360,"In regards to this film, I'll start out giving it justice where it is overwhelmingly deserved. The cinematography was breathtakingly beautiful, the acting was superb, and the effort towards making this film was clearly present. Now for the hard part. This movie's infection is the same infection of the antagonist in this film, and that is narcissism. If you're going to make a film this complex and science fiction based involving physics and/or time travel, please take the time to spend towards an explanation of believable context, and not spend 90 minutes filming people running and fighting backwards. Mr Nolan, you are a great director, but nobody has the 10 hours to dedicate towards making sense of this film in a way that the film can be appreciated more than for its acting, cinematography, and its acting. Also, I have a distaste for movies that crank the volume for its action, but then try to use quiet dialogue and accents for its plot structure, in a manner that you have to lean in just to hear something that you probably won't understand until the second time you see it. This film took Nolan 5 years to write the screenplay for. My, my, that is a very long time, not to involve more science in a science fiction movie. I understand that there were many creative scenes in which time moved backwards to give us a glimpse of the future. Many of them were very interesting to watch. Most were not. The actions of the female lead were the one part of this film that felt relatable, as a part of the human species. Even her character was a bit smug and pretentious, as she was willing to risk everything for....no spoiler zone.Rylee Reiter"
2361,"I tried, and it just didn't go well, similar to the storyline and acting shown here."
2362,I believe not many (perhaps nobody) can understand this movie at the first watch. So a ticket should also be eligible for multiple watches or somebody could easily sue them for taking their money and confusing them instead of entertaining.I rate it 7 since i very much liked the idea of two entities co existing while living on inverted timelines. To make them fight on the same scene was a genious effort. I had to think for a day to digest the fight scene.
2363,"Once again, Nolan proved to be a genius, but he added too much complexity to film :("
2364,"The Protagonist (John David Washington) is a CIA operative. He is captured during an operation in Ukraine. He is able to eat a cyanide pill. He wakes up and gets recruited to fight a new cold war. Someone in the future is using inverted entropy to affect events in the past. He and Neil (Robert Pattinson) start investigating zeroing in on former Russian oligarch, Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh), and his abused wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki).Christopher Nolan obviously has a thing about time. Memento happens to be one of my favorite films of all time. He is attacking it with all of his filmmaking skills and it is an attack from the editing, the sound mix, the plot, to the structure of the movie. First thing I noticed is that Nolan is relentlessly pushing the pace with every bit of filmmaking. The sound mix is like a heartbeat driving the movie whenever it goes into action mode. The editing is crisp and head-snapping. This is his transport plane deliberately driven into a constructed fake building. He's driving the movie into a fake building and not letting the audience the time to ruminate about the logic of the premise.In the end, that's its biggest flaw. The premise is out there and it's hard to keep track of the plot after the turn. The first part is a movie of one thing after another. When it gets to Kat, it finally tries to establish a connection with the characters. The fun part is the backward action moves but the logic of this premise keeps bugging me. For example, why is he trying to shoot himself in the past? Thinking about it after the fact leaves one with more questions and questions about the questions. The good part is that the relentless great action makes it impossible to dislike. The backwards action is just fun and different. That's plenty good enough."
2365,"The movie us so complicated, I still have no idea what it us all about. Too ling, some good action, but you loose interest in watching it"
2366,"Nolan screwed it up with the story and presented in a really complex manner which a layman will not be able to deduce even after watching it the third time.
First of all, the plot is very simple and predictable, one you might have seen a lot of time. I'll not go into details but, in a line, it's the same old ""A secret agency trying to save the world from a Russian mafia who wants to destroy the world by setting off a bomb."" This specific formula is overused in movies specifically James Bond and Mission Impossible. At least with those movies you know what's going on and with the latter you might get some unforgettable action sequences.
What nolan tried to do here was to spice it up a little, add some sci-fi elements, specifically, time inversion and time travel (time inversion in a way is time travel at normal speed and if you'll perceive it this way, you'll be able to understand the movie in a better sense). But the implementation is very confusing. The pacing of the movie is really fast without any character development. Maybe if you have a degree in Quantam Physics then you might be able to understand, otherwise no you can't. I'm pretty sure, Nolan wrote a linear script but accidentally put those pages in randon order.
The acting part is well taken care off. The characters are convincing and justify whatever parts they were given. But, none of them were relatable.
Cinematography is good but not great.
VFX are great. All the special effects used in this movie, be it physical effects or CGI, is different, and looks good. All the time inversion sequences are pleasure to watch even though you can't make out any of it.This is definately a step down from Interstellar, The Prestige, Memento, Inception and his other movies. Even primer and The Triangle were easy to understand.Pro tip: Watch Edge of Tomorrow, if you haven't already or if you have than you can watch again. That movie have everything that this one is lacking."
2367,"I'm completely speechless, what an amazing ride. If you can then don't miss it on the big screen .TIPS: 1. Keep your eye on the backpack of Neil (Robert Pattinson). 2. Make sure you watch TENET for twice.Spoiler -
Neil is the max, max is the Neil."
2368,"Kinda cool but to long, 'you don't need to understand everything' that was the most honest sentence said in the film."
2369,"I'll keep this simple because my brain is on overload after watching Tenet. It seems like a brilliant movie but I grew tired of it after the first six or eight hours because I didn't have a clue what was happening. If most of the audience cannot follow the plot there is something wrong.
Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director and the actors are superb but you need to read a treatise on the film's particular brand of time travel before you watch or you are just looking at images, nice images, but nothing more."
2370,"The whole film is based on a famous five-letter Latin ""magic square"" that can be read from left to right, from right to left, from top to bottom and from bottom to top, encapsulating the time reversibility that defines the movie. The center item, ""tenet"", is a palindrome which is both the synonym of ""principle"" or ""precept"" and the third person singular of the Latin verb ""tenere"", ""to hold"".
Here is the magic square (due to the fact that the site's layout doesn't allow any carriage return, write each word one below the other in the following order and align the letters): S A T O R - A R E P O - T E N E T - O P E R A - R O T A S. Approximate translation (although it isn't actually meant to make sense): ""Arepo the sower holds the wheels of the work"".
The five elements can be found in the film."
2371,"Try not to rewind... You'll get that once you watch it. Might need to rewatch it a couple of times. If you followed CN and The Dark Knight and all its twists and turns, you might follow this one. The storyline has the distinct tendency to fold back in on itself, kind of like threading a needle. In fact very much so. Pay astute attention throughout, because seemingly unimportant details early on became important later on throughout the film as the story line unfolds, interweaves, etc."
2372,"Again another mind blowing film from Christopher Nolan. Problem is not so much with the film, but with the development of it in a short time.
This movie could honestly have been much more, even if they decided to take it over a few films I am sure many more would have appreciated it.
I would have loved to see more of the character development especially of the main character. One moment he is in special ops, next he is dead, next he is alive, next he is manipulating time. All this in the first 10min of the movie.Brilliant idea with a lot of potential, but it's all a rush to the end unfortunately."
2373,It's honestly a 6/10. Are people still pretending you need to watch this 3 times to understand this dull jigsaw of a movie? A machine movie with no heart. I went to see this twice and I'm honestly enraged by it.
2374,"I wonder if Christopher Nolan still has it or if he should stick to writing movies but not direct them.... Tenet is visually poor, the music is dismal, the movie itself is boring until the third part when it becomes a little more interesting.... But that battle at the end... I play paintball and I've been in games that look more realistic and less Kitsch than that!!"
2375,"This Movie had a lot of action, interesting story line, and was very loud. However, you may need to watch it twice. The Film needs your full attention to detail, from start to finish, as to not get confused. I followed it, but found it unnecessarily choppy, disjointed and a lot going on at once in many parts. Far to many inconsistencies in the details that kept you questioning things, you shouldn't need to. This kind of dynamic film works, when it's cohesive. Over all it was Action packed and interesting in subject matter, but it could have been made with more coherency."
2376,"Tenet was a film that without a doubt was entertaining and action packed despite the long effort it took to get there. Christopher Nolan's direction and the performances of the actors are all fantastical, but unlike Interstellar or Inception the film does little to keep your interest in the first third, which is all fine and good once the ball starts rolling, but the way the film is structured and the tone presented in, makes for a confusing and rather dull first part. Despite the efforts of John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, and Elizabeth Dybecki the film at times still feels like a chore. Once again I cannot stress how great the last two thirds are and I think will improve the film upon a second viewing, when it comes to Nolan the creativity is admirable, but I wouldn't dare rank this among his best."
2377,"Audio was crappy, action needed work,and story was good tho."
2378,"Good visual effects, decent cast and ""ok"" story line. Wouldn't watch again..."
2379,I really hope that Nolan films will be very great but this film make me feel a little disappointed.
2380,Too complicate in the highway event. must describe a complicate in a clear way.
2381,"If you're looking for a movie just to pass the time, this is not it! This film is intended to involve the viewer with its content in such a way that, each viewer's overall response is likely to be directly proportional to how much HEAVY lifting he or she is willing to do in his or her interaction with its concepts.If I were to guess, I would say that most viewers came to appreciate the film ONLY AFTER: 1) the film was complete, AND 2) they took the time to mentally work through and process the information. There in lies this film's novelty, I believe.The story, concepts, and visuals, are pretty creative and mind-blowing! But they're also overwhelming because they are tied together in such a new way, have multiple variables, and are only fit into two and a half hours.YET, I believe once the viewer has taken the time to understand the pieces that Nolan is using, conceptually and visually, he or she can greatly appreciate the film for a pretty innovative work of art.I give it a 6.8/10, because I appreciate the final product Nolan created as a visual storyteller and artist, but I think he could have communicated everything a little more clearly and polished. That is, with respect to some of the more technical aspects: the sound mixing seemed a little rushed, as well as some of the scenes, acting, and dialogue.Overall, I enjoyed it. But much of my enjoyment came a good time after the film had ended and I was able to work it all out. Now that I am aware of the pieces and can see all that Nolan was able to work into his film, within such a limited timeframe, I can definitely say that I have a genuine appreciation for his contribution here to advance the medium."
2382,"This movie isn't for everyone, if you can't keep up with every little detail. You will most likely be lost, and have no idea whats going on. Anyway if you do pay attention, and catch the little details. Then you will realize this is another Nolan masterpiece. I love every minute of it. Gives me big time The Prestige vibes to it. Simply another on of Nolans masterpieces. That gets better every watch."
2383,"""Tenet"" is a film directed by Christopher Nolan, starring John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, and Elizabeth Debicki. It is about this spy that has to prevent World War III. Now that we have formalities out of the way; please watch this movie. It's okay if you wait a couple months until it's on blu-ray or digital, but you need to see this movie. The performances are outstanding, the soundtrack is superb, and just the tone and feel of this movie got me so invested. I almost don't want to say anything more. The only thing that could turn people off is that this movie is a mind f*ck. The first half I understood around 90%...but it went to 60% in the last half. The fun lies in connecting the pieces of the puzzle in your head to slowly get that percentage up. This is not a sit back and relax type movie. However, even though the puzzle aspect is fun, it is sometimes downright frustrating. The last act I was just left frustrated because my brain was left doing mental gymnastics. This is because the movie sometimes does not give you enough information to know very important things to the plot. You would have to be Sherlock Holmes to decipher some plot details, that I ended up to look up after the fact. All in all, ""Tenet"" is a worthwhile experience that you will remember for quite awhile."
2384,"One of my great joys is walking into a cinema excited with anticipation for a movie that I've been waiting months to see. Christopher Nolan has won world-wide acclaim as a director for the Batman trilogy, Inception and Dunkirk so it's fair to say that Hollywood would allow him to make anything he'd like at the moment, and that's where Tenet comes in. Written by Nolan it's a look at the world through futuristic eyes, much like Inception, and, if you've seen the preview, gives off some seriously weird vibes from the use of its special effects to explain time travel. Moviegoers have had to wait a long time to see this film (being delayed due to the covid crisis) but the wait is finally over and Hollywood's first big blockbuster post-covid release is here. But does it live up to all the hype?In its entire two hour and thirty minute running time Tenet doesn't give us actor John David Washington's name in the film, he is simply known as The Protagonist - a Special Forces type undercover operative in the mould of James Bond but without the digits. His mission, much like Bond's, is to save the world from total annihilation. It seems as if the villainous Russian known as Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh) has found a way to travel back and forth through time and will bring about Earth's demise if he isn't stopped. Making matters worse for The Protagonist is Sator's wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki). Being held captive in a loveless marriage she's willing to help him get close to Sator but only if she can get what she wants in return, to escape with her son. With such big stakes at play can the Protagonist succeed in his mission as well as play hero to an abused wife? With time travel involved anything seems possible as this literal race against time twists, turns and reverses to its ineluctable ?? conclusion.THE GOOD
With a budget of $205 million dollars you can rest assured the Nolan has made this movie look as beautiful as any film that has come before it. From the huge sweeping landscapes to the rough and tumble of the ships in the ocean, no expense was spared in the making of this film and the intense action and amazing special effects will blow your mind. Not one green screen was used throughout the film's shooting as Nolan wanted to give the movie a real-life feel. So when you see a 747 plane crash, it is actually a 747 plane crashing. The filmmaker's purchased a plane with the intent to crash it instead of using computer generated special effects to do the job. That's dedication to the craft right there!
As for the actors, John David Washington is good in any role but surprisingly it was Robert Pattinson, playing scientist/engineer/undercover agent Neil, who really won me over. I don't think he's ever made a film which I've really enjoyed (his films just aren't for my tastes) but with this performance (plus I've just seen his trailer for the new Batman film) he definitely has a fan in me.THE BAD
Where to start? Nothing is more frustrating as an audience member than being made to feel like an idiot by a director who is quite blatantly trying to show you that he is the smartest guy in the room. Tenet will make you feel like an idiot. And it's not in the ""I don't know what's happening but I'll find out by the end of the film"" way but more in the ""I don't know what happened and it's three days later and I still don't know what happened"" way. This film is the equivalent of someone telling you they know a secret but they can't tell you what it is. Then they come back 15 minutes later and say the same thing again. Now picture this going on for two and a half hours and this is how I felt walking out of Tenet. I even saw three people in my screening get up and leave the cinema halfway through the movie, never to return. I can completely understand how those people felt because it's at about the halfway mark that you realise Nolan isn't going to give you any answers. The time travel is what it is, the actors all talk really smarmy and really fast, like they're cops in an episode of Law & Order, and the audience is left looking at all the pretty pictures on the screen having no idea what is actually happening. I thought rule one of film making was not to make your audience feel stupid!THE UGLY
I think my movie buddy Lanie put it best when, 20 minutes after the film had finished, she mentioned ""I don't think I've ever seen you so angry after watching a film before!"" I responded ""Well A) you never saw me after Batman/Superman: Dawn of Justice (I was so irate I had to go home and lie down for two hours) and B) I don't enjoy watching films like Tenet where the whole audience is meant to clap and cheer for a movie made by a brilliant director all because he is a brilliant director."" This film is a two and half hour precocious, self-centred, egotistical, conceited mess that I never expected but had really high hopes for but which never came close to fulfilling. And thus my anger still burns!So what do you give a film that looks remarkable, has some truly amazing scenes and fantastic acting from the likes of Pattinson and Debicki but makes zero sense to anybody once the end credits roll?"
2385,"Christopher Nolan is no slouch when it comes to making ambitious, technically sophisticated films. Films like ""Inception"" and ""Dunkirk"" demonstrate his ability to take fairly straightforward premises and tell a captivating story while executing strongly on a cohesive vision. It's such a shame then that ""Tenet"" is his most fascinating film to date, but is his most poorly executed as well.""Tenet"" stars John David Washington as ""the Protagonist"" (yes, that is all he is referred to as), a CIA agent who is swept up into a fight against a group of people who can invert time. Throughout the film's first act the plot is hard to follow as the Protagonist jumps around locations with Neil (Robert Pattinson) and Kat (Elizabeth Debicki) with often very little context of why they are there or what they are after. Well, let me rephrase: I think a lot of these components are in the film but are lost in the film's audio design and the directing of the actors. Characters speak rapidly and constantly about what is happening and why they must do something, never really giving the audience enough time to process what is being said. There is one scene in particular with Michael Caine (who we never see in the film again) that sticks out so blatantly from the rest of the film where after it finished, my girlfriend leaned over to me and admitted she had no idea what just happened in that scene. As the film goes on this becomes less of an issue but in the first act where most of the world building and plot setup occurs, it definitely stops the viewer from engaging as much as they probably should; I think watching with subtitles will dramatically improve the experience.It doesn't help the matter either that the Protagonist is a pretty boring one at that, with the supporting characters are not very interesting themselves. I realized as the film was progressing that I was invested in the film not for the story really but for the next instance of the film's inversion gimmick. By the third act the film devolves into a ""stop the bad guy before activating his doomsday device"" trope and despite having the slick ""inversion"" paint slathered over it, there is not much left to the plot and characters by that point. The acting itself in the film is very strong and subtle, especially those of Pattinson, Debicki and Kenneth Branagh as the antagonist Andrei Sator; Pattinson is suave and precise with his line delivery (even if it's pretty zany at times) and Debicki really shows her range, going from provocative to distressed many times in the film. Branagh is particularly of interest because many times he quickly goes from stoic and intimidating to brutal and dominating. Alas, if not for the film's implementation of the inversion, I reckon this film would be fairly mundane because the characters themselves don't contribute much to the plot or enjoyment of the film.Much akin to the polarizing reaction to ""Inception,"" where moviegoers raved about how the film played with their mind, ""Tenet"" operates in a similar vein of mind-bending storytelling. The ""inversion"" mechanic of the film creates for so many great moments-from plot reveals to set pieces-that by the film's end, I wasn't left with questions about the mechanics; in other words, the film satisfactorily explores its own mechanics, not leaving much room to nitpick certain scenarios or how something might not have worked. There was a long period of time while watching where the plot felt so disconnected from the action, but about halfway through the film comes a point where it all clicks and things start making sense. A scientist character says to the Protagonist early on into the film when he asks how the inversion works, ""Don't try to understand it. Just feel it,"" and that is largely my greatest recommendation going into the film.""Tenet"" comes at a really unique time, as it was the first film I saw in the theater since the COVID-19 pandemic began. It was so exhilarating being back in the theater (experiencing a Nolan film no less) after being away for so long. I really wanted this film to be amazing--a new Nolan film that not only satisfies my expectations of him but of a film in general after this drought. To that end, the acting, cinematography, visual effects and score of ""Tenet"" are all executed well making it suitable for the theater, but its dialogue problems and uninteresting characters prevent it from being a film I can instantly recommend."
2386,"We went to the local multiplex Sunday morning, partly to ensure we wouldn't have to worry about hordes of people crowding into a space and partly because the industry needs a boost.
I'd been looking forward to Chistopher Nolans 'bond on steroids' for a long time and the trailers whetted the appetite enough to brave the outside world.
A day later, the experience remains strong and it is difficult to explain unless you have already watched it.
The spoiler free story is one of international intrigue and globe trotting hyper stylish scenes with mind bending thread running through."
2387,"Personal rating 7/10.
I don't understand why people say: ""I didn't understand"" ... maybe you were too busy with your smartphone !!!
Having said that, it is a crazy film, on a technical and directing level it will surely have given many a headache, something like this was not seen since Inception.
Too long for my taste, even if for good or bad it never lets you take a breather, to see everything in one breath.
Impeccable cast, a little less the script and the plot."
2388,More mind bending Christopher Nolan genius. Glued to the screen trying to understand and fathom all that was happening. Can't wait to see it again. Love the psychological mind games!
2389,"I think this movie gets this qualification because it is a quality movie , it has good sound design and good directing but if the rating were based only in personal enjoyment it would probably be two points down."
2390,"Extraordinary! Already watched it twice and can't wait to see it more and more until I fully understand it! Acting is incredible, cinematography is mind blowing and the real action scenes are breathtaking! And the fact that all the scenes are practical effects and there's no CGI or green screen just confirms what a masterpiece TENET is! Nolan is a master!"
2391,I think the movie was good but I honestly had no clue what they were saying for 90 percent of the movie and when I could hear it seemed like I missed something. Action and visuals were really cool tho.
2392,"I loved Christopher Nolan movies but for me at least, he missed a beat with this one. Sound again was an issue, foreign accents and people wearing masks etc were very hard to hear and sometimes conversations in the streets sounded very tinny. On the flip side though, the score was incredible.Can't obviously give anything away with this movie but I think I'd need to see it again to see what I missed (with subtitles) beneath the surface. I just didn't really find it that interesting overall but ignore the 1/10's etc, it's a good film just not one of Nolan's best."
2393,"Want to start by saying that I am a big Christopher Nolan fan. I went into this movie expecting to be slightly mind f'd just like I was after Inception and Interstellar. My favorite part about those movies was the discussions and debates I could have with my friends afterward, discussing and working through what we just watched. However, after watching Tenet, we all just sat there asking ourselves ""what did we just watch"" and ""what just happened?"".This movie felt like an attempt by Nolan to one-up some of his masterpieces by seeing just how confused he could make an entire audience. It wasn't necessarily that the plot was so complex beyond understanding, it was the fact that there were very important scenes in which you couldn't understand what the characters were saying at all. Scenes on the boats and in cars, discussions over the phone, discussions with oxygen masks on, discussions with loud music and exterior noise in general, etc.From a sheer entertainment standpoint, the movie doesn't disappoint. It just seemed like we got to the ""wow"" moment at the end without understanding how we really got there. The shock value at the end was overshadowed by the convoluted and muddled story and dialogue that led to it.I will watch this movie again, but with the volume lower and subtitles on."
2394,"Spell it backward or forward, it spells the same. From Christopher Nolan - the virtuoso behind ""The Dark Knight"" Trilogy, ""Inception"", and ""Dunkirk"" - comes ""Tenet"", an action blockbuster on a scale not seen before and that will never be replicated again.Armed with only one word, Tenet, and fighting for the survival of the entire world, a Protagonist journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that will unfold in something beyond real-time.The plot summary I just gave you is the exact one supplied by the studio. I did this for fear of spoilers and because I cannot confidently give out any more information than what has already been covered.""Tenet"" may be the most incomprehensible and mentally straining movie ever made. It feels like taking a whole semester of advanced physics in only one class period, all while being set in a warzone. I have no doubt there will be case studies and theses done about this movie.Nolan wastes no time throwing his audience over the deep end. He begins the film at a breakneck pace, moving from scene to scene in the blink of an eye. You struggle to grasp onto the high concept in real-time and are always playing catchup. This problem only exponentially gets worse as Nolan refuses to hold your hand as he goes further down the rabbit hole. Even one of the characters in the movie says ""Don't try to understand it, feel it"". It's almost as if Nolan inserted that quip just for the audience.The inability to follow the movie can be attributed to the out of the box concept, but mostly it falls on Nolan's embarrassingly weak script. The problems here are the same ones people have been saying about him for years now, that he overuses exposition and under-delivers on the emotional parts of his narrative.""Tenet"" is nearly all exposition and no emotion. Many times the exposition gives more questions than answers and seems to be intentionally leading us astray. It's also Nolan's coldest film as any emotion is forced through cliche storylines that seem included to check off a box rather than tell a story.On a technical level, ""Tenet"" is both Nolan's most and least impressive film to date.The action set-pieces mix both practical and visual effects seamlessly, creating awe-inspiring showcases of movie magic. The use of time inversion in fight sequences, car chases, and an entire battle are just some of the moments that you have to see to believe. Hoyte Van Hoytema encapsulates all the gorgeous chaos in stunning widescreen cinematography and composer Ludwig Göransson overtakes your ears with a perfect hard-charging score.What's a problem here, and has been for some time now, is Nolan's astoundingly poor sound mixing. Without hesitation, I can say that ""Tenet"" is the loudest movie I have ever seen. Every gunshot felt like it went off next to my ear and every explosion shook my entire body. The ungodly loud sound effects made it near impossible to comprehend much of the dialogue, which was already poorly mixed, to begin with. If you thought it was hard to understand Bane in ""The Dark Knight Rises"", just wait until you try to understand what the characters are saying here.Even with all my gripes, I was still enveloped in the world Nolan has created. There have been dozens of movies where I was lost after a few minutes and checked out for the remaining runtime. With ""Tenet"", I was lost after minute one and completely invested for the remaining one hundred forty-nine. Part of that interest comes from the spectacle and part of that comes from the likable cast.In a star-making lead performance oozing with charisma, John David Washington plays our protagonist, who is literally called The Protagonist. He's our vessel as he enters into this strange new world with no previous knowledge and must solve a deadly puzzle that goes against all logic.Robert Pattinson keeps his hot streak going with another charming performance as The Protagonist's sidekick, Neil.Kenneth Branagh is intermittently good as our Russian villain, Andrei Sator. He's exceptionally menacing in the quieter moments and cartoonishly over-the-top in his moments of outburst.Elizabeth Debicki plays the most emotionally resonant character as the helpless wife of our villain. Debicki is great in the role but is unfairly used more as an object for the story.""Tenet"" is a full-on assault of the senses that contains unparalleled moments of spectacle and ambition. It's nowhere near the top of Nolan's filmography and will surely require multiple viewings to unravel. Make sure to pack some ibuprofen and prepare to have your mind twisted in ways you never thought possible."
2395,"Well. I have had my second viewing of Tenet and maybe it's just me but The Last Scene still makes absolutely no sense to me(Protagonist and Priya) There is no indication throughout the whole movie at all that He Masterminded anything.Also the Neil issue.If John Connor Is killed then he cannot do anything in the Future Right? So what about Neil.I have heard some people say it was a Time Loop but that's too confusing and who would knowingly sign up for a Damn Time Loop?Another suggestion that was put up was that, well he's known Protagonist for years and he did all that just to save him at the Opera because Protagonist was THE Eventuality in the First Place.Others say it's a Multiverse and that is Plausible but would make it kind of drawn out.Another thing is, couldn't they have shown that Ives was from the Future better than that? It was way too Abrupt and like oh well, I guess we will just go with it.What is the Deal with the Russian? Is he trying to reverse time to reverse his issue so that he can live? Or Maybe reverse time so that the nuclear incident he went through doesnt happen?It can't be, he is just trying to blow up the world, how ridiculous is that?Also the turnstiles, What is up with them? It was completely weird and out of nowhere.Highlights° That Last Quarter of the Movie with all those Hidden Gems was so Entertaining.° The Inversion is Incredible to watch at Times.° That Hallway Fight Scene Is Absolutely Incredible, the Movement is out of this World.° The Soundtrack is Awesome, I swear some of the sounds were weird, it was Brilliant.Overall, Look you are either going to get it or you won't and for me you have to assume quite a few things. Who knows, maybe years down the line someone will put it all together or look at it differently."
2396,"A mind-bending thrill ride, keeps you puzzled and confused. You need to be very focused in the detailing of every scene. No use of CGI worked really well to create this perfection, another Masterpiece added in his account and only he can make such movies.
After this time stone thriller, nolan has completed its gauntlet.You've watched many time travel movies, but it leaves your mind inverted and you've never watched such time travel movie.
There are some issues but can't discuss as it's a non- spoiler review.Go and experience the another beautifully crafter Masterpiece by Christopher Nolan."
2397,"Sadly I am going to rewatch this film. In order to hopefully find it interesting. Aside from the muffled dialogue, I found the the actors mouth breathing WAAY too distracting.As for the acting I thought most of the actors seems fluid and natural, actually pretty good. John David Washington seemed to be a fish out of water. His acting was pretty empty it just did not seem believable.With more work maybe I'll invert my rating."
2398,"It's fair to call this Nolan's most ambitious movie yet, although twice the complexity does unfortunately mean double the exposition and half the clarity."
2399,"This move has beautiful set pieces, and it is like figuring out a puzzle. It will blow you away"
2400,"Cinematography and special effects were superb. The story, well, was really not that complicated if you focused on the macro level. At the end of the day, we know it's about time travel, but the question is the how and what happens, is happening, has happened, and if they had had happened. at all More importantly, is paradox a real deal like other movies have had explored before. I was surprised pretty boy, Robert Pattinson, played Neil really well. At times, he overshadowed the lead, the Protagonist, John David Washington, who was overly exposed, and wasn't vulnerable enough. But I got it, it was part of the puzzles to this movie. Anyway, the scores, special effects, and cinematography, made it a very good movie. But it's neither Momento nor Inception afterall."
2401,"Tried to keep up with the storyline, but lost track at some point and to make it even worse, dozed off for a bit. I feel like this movie was lost on me plotwise, nevertheless I did enjoy the acting, the music and the amazing special effects.A must see for people who can actually follow intricate plotlines and are into Christopher Nolan's mind-boggling productions."
2402,"I watched this movie once, and I have not fully digested the story line and logic, in a good way. The acting, action, directing, cinematography, editing and soundtrack were spot on and I truly appreciate this action, mystery sci-fi movie. As seen in the trailers, it involves the journey in time and parallels, although the movie focuses on a short time frame.It might feel like a lot of exposition in the dialogue, but they are needed for this type of movie. I am still dazed! The story line is interrelated and is weaved through out the start to end of the movie.Maybe I was not paying enough attention or just dense, but, I probably need one or two more times to truly appreciate the ""science"" or ""world"" of Tenet. Hopefully, some commentary out there to explain it all to me like I was a 2 year old before it goes on disc or streaming services.All in all, a recommended action sci-fi movie which requires a lot of attention and understanding and if you don't fully get it, the action and visuals will make do till you watch it again."
2403,"An intelligent film. You have to concentrate on the plot. Very good actors, especially Elizabeth Debicki, John David Washington and Robert Pattinson. Movie entertainment at its best! ✨"
2404,"A lot of mind-blowing visuals, but personally I didn't felt connected to the main characters.
Take Inception, for instance. You feel the pain of Cobb, who as lost his wife and is still struggling with it. Or Memento. You can even feel sympathy for both characters in the Prestige.
This is just a cold-hearted, fast-paced sci-fi movie.
And the score is little bit intrusive.
Not Nolan's finest hour, but still a innovative idea, with great technical execution.
I will give it a second chance"
2405,"Brilliant concept, but (almost) everything was predictable for me. It was fun to watch but something missed from it. I really like mind bending movies and new ideas but it felt like the story was just an excuse. Overall its a must watch, just don't think while you watch the movie or you lost the magic like i did."
2406,"I'm going to be short since going into detail wont add much I'm afraid.Tenet is a great Nolan film, just like you're used to by now. The story is great and can be quite difficult to follow, but just pay attention and you'll get the hang out of it. Heck it even makes you anticipate and think like the main 'villain' later on in the movie.Actors are amazing (obviously), Soundtrack is great, effects are amazing.Just go check it out before the past is gonna get a hold on you ;-) go go go!"
2407,"The beginning throws a lot at the viewer without really giving you time to understand whats going on. Hell, took me minute in the theater to realize the trailers had stopped playing and the movie actually began.There is a lot of exposition in the beginning, explaining the inverse time thing and talking about philosophical things which there is a lot of in this movie. A bit on the nose in my opinion and didn't really come as naturally as one might expect.There is 0 character building as well. 1 hr after watching the movie and I have no clue what the main characters name was. I'm not sure if anyone ever even said his name.The emotional bonding of the characters is also a bit lacking there are only 2 characters you really care about Pattinson and Washington and even them I didnt really care about. The emotional notes weren't really hit.What makes this movie though are the cool action moments of the inverse time and its ramifications on things. Interesting yet at the same time quite confusing. The clues and tricks through out the movie with the time mechanic started paying off more towards the end of the movie when you actually got to see the effects of the time inverter.At times a thought provoking film with some great action, yet nowhere near Nolans other masterpieces such as interstellar or inception as the movie itself felt more like an action romp even more so that batman for crying out loud. But the movies greatest fault has to be the total lack of emotional impact. During interstellar I bawled like a little girl yet during this didnt even feel like shedding a tear nor laughing. Lacks emotion is the problem, which leaves the movie feeling quite cold.But is it worth watching? Certainly but it's not in any way the masterpiece some people are claiming it be, but a good action movie and this is coming from someone that has watched nearly all of nolans films and loved them each."
2408,Looks great and sounds amazing. Hard to stick with what's going on at some points though and does sag in the middle. Redeems itself in final 3rd. Overall a great movie intended to be puzzling. But poorly edited in several points where it feels to abruptly cut from action to suddenly everyone is ok. And far to loud at key points
2409,"If you are booked in to watch this in IMAX then you will love the perfect picture quality as Nolan filmed this in 70mm for IMAX screens. Everything is clear, colourful and looks glorious. But if you value your ears then be warned. This movie is super loud! As IMAX sound systems are one of the best in the world you are going to be deafened by the explosions and movie soundtrack! Nolan is no stranger to blasting us with bass and there is a lot of booming going on, but at times it is tiring on the ears and he seems to have lost his way on this movie. I was so looking forward to this and the opening action sequence had so much promise until the movie title popped up and after that it was downhill.
If you think of this movie of not time travel but inverted time so reversing or controlling time from a past and present same reality but inverted then you will get the hang of it. I knew Nolan would twist things up and although the critics bang on about it not being time travel it does get mentioned a few times although we all know that it's practically impossible and the same person seeing themself in the same location would blow up the world or something like that! Once you have figured out what the hell is going on you realise that it still makes no sense even when they are explaining it in the dialogue - but as the effects and music is so loud some of the explanations are drowned out (something which the critic scolded Nolan for with Interstellar!).
Let's park that for now and focus on the movie content. Yes it does have action but comparing it to Christopher Nolan's other movies it is not on par, in fact it felt a bit light weight. We have a decent inverted car chase which was cool (yes you can drive a car at speed going backwards by just reversing the body shell, nothing new here folks!) and as mentioned the opening opera house hostage scene was epic. Fast forward to the ending scenes (no spoilers here) and it felt like a pathetic paint ball team building exercise with a bunch of red and blue team full face mask camo outfitted people wildly shooting and not a single baddie in sight! What the hell was that all about, really bad!
Then we have the actors;
John David Washington plays the lead ex CIA agent now world saving secret agent guy (yes he moved on that quickly to saving the world from destruction just after a quick chat with some shady guy - major editing room cut sequence I think!). This guy cannot act! He is so wooden and has no screen presence or charisma. Totally the wrong lead for this movie.
Robert Pattison (Twilight fame) is good but still a bit of a drip and hasn't shaken his Twilight stereo type image. He is playing the new Batman so I really hope he either beefs up or comes across less of a snowflake.
Kenneth Branagh is cool. He is the only actor throughout (Michael Caine had a 2 minute performance which was also brilliant) that provided a scrap of intelligent acting.
Elizabeth Debicki (playing Lady Di in the next series of Netflix's The Crown) was okay but not a character you would remember and easily lost in all the chaos thrown at you throughout the 2 and 1/2 hours!
This is a real turn for the worse for Nolan as he has brought us some fantastic movies, Dark Knight movies, Insomnia, Memento, Interstellar and Inception, but in my opinion this is one of his worst and I feel he has lost his way and just tried to dish up something visually amazing and loud (which is both) but sadly very poor plot and bad acting. Blowing stuff up, and trying to destroy the audience ear drums, does not make a great movie.
I did have to laugh as a group outside were saying it was great and it made sense - no it didn't, it wasn't made to make sense as no one knows about inverted real time versus past and present paradox's! I think Nolan has tried to outsmart the audience and for those that don't watch a lot of movies yes probably they will love it (like 1917 when everyone thought that was amazing but in fact it was more blowing stuff up, no plot and annoying dialogue but I agree visually stunning!)
If people are going to start thinking movies are all about the visually stunning cinematic movie sets and backdrops then perhaps they should watch some indie movies as that will provide them with weeks of ""wow that looks amazing"" but not so much gripping action. It's rare to get a movie that captures both the amazing visuals along with a great plot, sound acting abilities and captivating audiences by bringing them on the journey not trying to outsmart them like Nolan has attempted here, but ended up looking like a bit of a fool.
Some say watch it twice, okay yes you can do that if you don't understand it the first time but I did, and it wasn't good enough to warrant a second viewing, especially that I've damaged my hearing from movie watching and other activities over the years, don't need another Nolan onslaught! '
I do hope his next movie (Memento remake) is good - why do we need a remake of a classic fantastic movie Momento?"
2410,"This was our first movie at the theatre since COVID hot and we were super excited for this movie! That excitement quickly turned to confusion and frustration.The movie started out fairly easy to follow and then it just goes completely out into left field about half way though. Christopher Nolan has NOT done it again like some have suggested.John David Washington's character is so boring, bland, and he gives you no reason to like or even root for his character. I couldn't have cared less if he lived or died at the end. Robert Pattinson was probably the best thing about this movie.The plot is so hard to understand. It literally makes zero sense and what you do understand, you really don't. The movie has so many editing errors from actors mouths not moving when you hear their voice, to characters jumping time from scene to scene which aren't part of the inversion scenes. Just lazy editing. Oh, and often you can't understand what is actually being said because the voices are so muffled and the music takes over.This is definitely not a movie that needs to be seen in the theatre. I would watch it again but only when it is available for free and I have the option to pause it and really understand what is going on. My brain hurts even trying to comprehend this mess."
2411,Acting was good film not so I know what was going to happen straight away it was a terrible film I made this because spend a lot for nothing it was good to get out of the house but been reading some reviews and everyone is say it's brilliant don't get me wrong acting was good but that's it come on it was just making stuff up as it went along very long with no pay off bad
2412,"This is from Nolan, Inception's director and because of that I'll never watch this. This guy is so pretentious and full of it that makes David Lynch look like a humble guy. Avoid at all costs."
2413,"He blams come thick and fast. Tenet, in fact, might be Christopher Nolan's blammiest film yet. BLAM! A terrifying thing just happened. BLAM! A shocking moment of revelation. BLAM! Here's a speedboat. (There really is a massive blam accompanying an otherwise ordinary shot of two people on a speedboat.) It's not even Hans Zimmer this time - here the great Ludwig Göransson (Black Panther, The Mandalorian) is on scoring duties, making it all his own (you will nod your head intensely) but without ever scrimping on the blams. Because if a Christopher Nolan film doesn't sound like the end of the world, then something's wrong. And this one really is about the end of the world."
2414,"So just got back from seeing Tenet and thought I'd lay down some thoughts. Fear not, as I promise you this will soil nothing of the plot. Quite frankly, I wouldn't even know where to begin, since this is one film that is a bona fide assault on the mind.For those planning (or able) to see it soon, all I can say is bring your A-game, as this film is hard work. The plot is extremely convoluted, focused around a Nolanised concept called 'time inversion' (which is briefly and, dare I say, ineffectively explained at the beginning), told via an onslaught of rapid-fire dialogue and exposition for nearly all of it's 150-minute runtime. It makes Inception seem like Sesame Street by comparison, and it strongly reminded me of Primer, which I always considered one of the most difficult films to follow... until now.The pacing is relentless, rarely slowing down enough for the audience to digest the cavalcade of information thrown at them. Adding to the confusion is the sound mix, which often makes dialogue very difficult to hear and ultimately obscures vital information for the audience.By the end of the film, I was left with an idea of the overall plot, but feel it's going to take many revisits to fully understand the details, which are kinda crucial in really understanding what's going on. I trust Nolan has a firm grasp on the logistics of his story, but without an all access pass to the depths of his imagination, it's a hard task to firm grasp on the concept.I can't even really rate this movie (the review rating is more if a rating-in-progress)... I know somewhere in the future I adore this film, but for now I'm as lost as the protagonist was for at least the first hour."
2415,"I didn't it was awfulClearly it's marmite film , those who have seen it twice seem to enjoy it second time , I'm in no hurry to see it again . I never enjoyed Inception and never really got into Matrix , if these are your type of films you'll probably love it .For me it was just a plotless confusing mess but Nolan fans ( not the Nolan sisters ) are raving about itThe three of us in the cinema were all scratching our heads after it finished which took an eternitySorry just not my cup of tea , cannot recommend it .Pad.A 1/10"
2416,"I couldn't spoil the movie even if I tried.
It felt like a return to church. Typically, a congregation is there for each other, elevated by the shared experience in transcendent possibility granted us by similar material that ignites the imagination. Of course, every member of this ""congregation"" entered into the said ""shared experience"" during 2020, a year doomed to become an adjective. And let me tell you: This experience was a real 2020.
As the lights lowered, so did my facemask, but only for a sip of my brew or to capitalize on stolen fries (thanks, girlfriend). Others in the theater did the same thing, although they were slightly more liberal than I was with removing material that seemingly protects the air we breathe. The Flix Brewhouse Pre-Show consisted of scenes from past Christopher Nolan flicks such as ""Inception"" and ""Memento,"" two films that define his canon (like ""Dunkirk,"" time itself is used to serve the story). Also, we were enlightened, via video-special, about the painstaking protocol that the movie-theater staff have had to endure since Covid-19 became the Covid-20 that we know today. Did I feel safe? Well, I didn't come to the theater to see a horror movie, even though fear is generally absent even if I were. Safety first, I get it. That's how I ""sell,"" too.
The movie begins with a bang, literally. The sounds of guns in a theater (in only one case were they unwelcomed in a Nolan film, and that was in 2012 during a showing of Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" which makes this first scene a little extra-intense because men enter an actual theater with machine guns) are extra-loud as if the audience is taken to a shooting range on a Michael Mann set (the same director Nolan imitated for the first scene of ""The Dark Knight""). I'm once again transported into that transcendent possibility. The music is amazing. The action is intense. The scene demands attention. Keep in mind, this is my first film-going experience in over half a year, and hadn't realized how much I've been longing for just a LOUD experience, but I am no stranger to watching films that are new to me. So the ""transcendent possibility,"" to me, remains a possibility, I'm afraid...
...Only...a possibility.
The shark is in your face in scene two. A Spielbergian discount trick, a new filmmaker won't have the money to show the shark throughout the whole film, so the pop-shot, literally the shark popping its head out of the water, is an intense moment. The shark's fin is teased only in scene 1, but as we go to scene 2, everything is explained (and the only interesting thing about the scene is the idea itself, which would have been just as well explained by, you know, watching the actual movie). Well, an explanation is given, anyway. Nothing is really ""explained.""
Here's the rundown, though...There is new technology. New to us (in the present), yet probably better understood in the future (when it is invented). This technology enables us to know the future by reliving the past. Doing so, re-experiencing the past, requires us to mirror the events as we (in the present) are inverted (into the past), literally moving backwards. To explain visually, you are driving a car whilst ""inverted"" (meaning: re-experiencing a past event), you will appear driving a vehicle backwards to those experiencing time going forward. Confusing? Not sure the science is clear, here. This is no ""Interstellar.""
The entire show, I felt ready to punch myself for the sake of the film not knocking any sense into me. Cue: The Jerry Seinfeld stand-up bit where he's in a darkened theater, whispering endless questions throughout a movie (because he's confused) ""Who's that guy? What does he want? Why is she with him? Why is he like that? Why does she stay with him if he's like that? Why did they ever have a kid together? Why did she kill him?""
""Ohhhhhh...well, it's good that she killed him, then.""
Sitting in my seat, I literally became the meme: ""MAKE IT MAKE SENSE!""
But that's been me this entire year, this 2020 that we've gotten ourselves into.
""Tenet,"" a palindromic title being more suggestive than meaningful (at least to the confused audience member that I was), seems meant NOT for us in the present. This film is NOT meant to be viewed only once. This film is made for our future selves (if you're asking me). To watch the film almost requires a class to understand, although the story is pretty simple:
A woman stays with her abusive husband for the sake of being with her child. Yet, the child, a major character (in a twist that still doesn't make sense to me), is essentially a MacGuffin (an object used for the story, but used only for character motivation, not a part of the real story).
What does this have to do with time travel?
What does Time Travel have to do with the story?
Well, it's necessary to save the world. WHAT?
Oh yeah, the villain (the husband) wants to blow up the world.
So we need all these unnamed characters, essentially uninteresting versions of James Bond (there is...NO room for character development here).
What I really feel, having only seen it as my present self (although with reflection time as my future self, presently)...is this film falls victim to a filmmaker's number one fear: Being pretentious. What I believe is that, with ""Memento"" and all the cinematic tricks that make it great (each progressive scene takes place prior to the previous one chronologically)...and ""Inception,"" another high-concept film that also borders on pretentious filmmaking...""Tenet"" seems merely the next logical step. It's as if Christopher Nolan asked himself ""How have I yet to play with time?""
I'd even go so far as to say that Nolan is aware of his pretentiousness. Enter the token Michael Caine character, there for our protagonist (literally only called ""The Protagonist"" in this movie) to mistreat a server by trying to act like a rich snob only to be called out because he doesn't look rich enough. This was the film's one of maybe two attempts at humor. No time for that.
The trick itself has been done in countless movies. A scene is filmed and played backwards in the film. Usually this trick is done to mask the fact that the scene couldn't otherwise be pulled off. Usually, this trick is done without the audience realizing it. Here, though, in ""Tenet,"" the audience is supposed to marvel at the filmmaking with plenty of ""Ooohs"" and ""Ahhhhs,"" and Nolan doesn't have to worry about the audience asking ""Would this movie work if it wasn't filmed this way?""
That's what happens with ""Memento."" That's what happens with ""Dunkirk,"" too (although, I'd argue that a complimentary film to ""Dunkirk,"" ""1917,"" could NOT have worked any other way than how the director made it). Every other Christopher Nolan film works gloriously (and it'd be worth it to watch them re-edited into chronological order). Here, ""Tenet"" could not be filmed another way because the filmmaking is the story (the ""reverse-film-effect"" IS central to the plot). And Nolan gets himself into trouble here. See, the movie is many movies. We have a dysfunctional family plot. We have a heist movie. We have a war film again, too (more reminiscent of ""Full Metal Jacket,"" as Nolan is a Kubrick-lover, but this is NO Kubrick film). And we have a futuristic time-travel movie (without feeling like a science-fiction film almost at all). And we have the reverse-film-effect concept in itself (when you blow up in an exploding car, you freeze with hypothermia), which is the ""new technology"" that the film wastes no time having to explain, although it does so in the only way possible, through analogy. Through idea. Through concept. Through show and tell. Well, tell and show. And the audience must buy this rather than think about it.
It feels like Nolan thought about it, but this is why I really must label this movie pretentious. Don't take my word for it, though. The movie made me feel stupid, which is a natural side-effect of a pretentious film. Maybe you'll be in for the car chases and the explosions without questioning the rest of it. But for a movie that provides so many answers, one wonders the questions that are being asked.
Or is it the other way around?"
2417,"Coming into this film I had seen most of Nolan's films, my favourite film of his being inception so my expectations were pretty high, it's safe to say that the first time around I was too confused to properly rate it because i thought it wouldn't be fair to try and describe something I didn't quite yet understand. After the 2nd watch I think it's safe to say that this is the best directed film of all time, all the niches and nuances that you pick up on the second watch make the film so much more enjoyable. The first watch feels as if you are trying to reach the end of a maze with your eyes shut but after taking off the blindfold you can really appreciate the maze and enjoy all that it has to offer."
2418,"It felt so good to be able to watch a film in a cinema again and hopefully Tenet can keep cinemas afloat during this time of crisis in our world.In Tenet a Protagonist, armed with only one word and the survival of the world, journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that will unfold in something beyond real time.I honestly did not know how to summarise this film's plot. There was a time where people told me how complex Inception was and after viewing it, I thought it was fairly straightforward and easy to follow. Tenet, however, is on a whole another level. One viewing is simply not enough to understand everything that goes on in this film and that makes me so much more excited to watch it again. The first hour or so, Tenet leaves so many questions in your mind and it's not until after that where a few things start to get cleared up. To an average moviegoer, this film may be inaccessible due to how hard it is to follow and because of that I can see a group of people not liking Tenet. Despite not understanding everything that happens, I had a complete blast watching it.If we're talking about technical aspects, what Christopher Nolan was able to accomplish is astounding. Nolan loves time and the concept of inversion creates some very impressive action sequences. The action scenes are so unique and extremely well put together. Some people move forwards whilst others move backwards and when they fight together, it becomes so gripping and entertaining. Two particular sequences taking place at an airport and highway were mesmerising. Nolan's choice of using practical effects has created so many memorable scenes and Tenet is full of them. It's a shame Hans Zimmer couldn't do the score for this film but Ludwig Göransson fills in his place brilliantly. The score and music fits the film really well and there are hints of reversal which matches the theme of the film perfectly. The only technical flaw was the film's sound mixing. Remember how hard it was to understand Bane in The Dark Knight Rises without subtitles. Tenet suffers the same issue. At times the music is so loud that it becomes difficult to decipher what characters are saying.The performances are also great. After BlacKkKlansman, John David Washington delivers another terrific performance. Robert Pattinson has been really impressing me lately and he does a great job once again. I haven't been exposed to Elizabeth Debicki much but from this film she shows her capabilities as an actress. Dimple Kapadia does well and I think Kenneth Branagh played the villain role well. The problem with these characters is how distant you feel from them. Debicki is the only one you really connect with and care for. In Inception we felt connected to DiCaprio because of his wife and in Interstellar there was a connection with McConaughey due to his daughter in the film. Our lead in Tenet doesn't have anything like that so it became hard to resonate with him.Tenet is certainly not Nolan's best film but I would rather watch this film again over some of his other films. This is a puzzle I would love to solve and I'm in complete awe at the effort that went into the story and visuals. I was consistently entertained and cannot wait to give it another watch. If you don't want to risk going to the cinemas that's completely understandable but definitely watch Tenet when it comes out on VOD or Blu-ray."
2419,"The reference is the Bond franchise. Mid way between a tribute (the villain, the settings, the clothes, the final battle...) and a parody (the music!). Being Nolan, atomic bomb becomes time control here. Expensive for what it delivers."
2420,"See it for yourself, a masterpiece. Nolan continues to excel as a filmmaker and has managed to once again improve upon his existing oeuvre."
2421,"The cinematography, score and acting are amazing, exactly what you can expect from a Nolan's movie. Ludwig Göransson did a fantastic job in mixing backround ambience for action and traveling and clearer themes for the important moments just the right amount. Hoyte Van Hoytema captured probably the best car chase scene of the Year and the acting was also fantastic but the characters didn't have much of a backstory. They played really well the role that what was written for them but a little bit of backround would have been nice to bring deeper motives and storylines to the movie.The story was typical Nolan in a good way, but i think that there was a little too complex logic to to be digested in a two and a half our movie.Typically when i watch movies with scifi elements, i try to figure out the logic that the writer was thinking but this time I just accepted that i wasn't going to figure out the whole plot during the first time watching so i just sat down and enjoyed the ride. (Even tough i already was sitting) But in the end it was a really good movie without any big noticeable downsides. I am definitely going to see it again at least once."
2422,The directing is just genius and super complex. When we left the theater everyone said the movie was super complex and very tiring. If you pay close enough attention you can understand the deep connection of science and art. This can inspire many generations to come to pursue and love both of them.
2423,"Trust Nolan to use this medium to amalgamate time, story, space, emotion, reality and idea and just dish out a thorough blockbuster. And he does that with aplomb again. I wasn't much too impressed with his last venture Dunkirk. But as it is with every Nolan film, it's not much about the story he sells but the entire experience of watching it on the big screen. And boy o boy Tenet does that. Armed with a story of altering reality and time with the usual 'save the world' plot, Tenet follows protagonist (Washington) on a journey to prevent WW3. Pretty standard Nolan stuff happens, time and realities begin to mix up making it tougher for the audience to grasp what is happening. There are a couple of dialogues certain characters mouth, ""Don't try to understand it, just feel it."" Follwed by one towards the end, ""If you can't stop thinking about time in linear sense, this is not for you."" These 2 dialogues should pretty much sum up the film for you. Because one will understand the story after multiple watches, or if you are lazy you will just google 'Tenet explained'. But there is no fun it. Trust me, there is no fun in googling the answer instead of watching it and rewatching it again to understand a Nolan film piece by piece.Now the acting by the lead cast of Washington, Pattinson and Elizabeth are decent. I have seen them perform better. They do the job well. The tight screenplay does allow them to mask some shortcomings. Dimple Kapadia has a very good role, it's not a 2 min dash and she has ample amount of dialogues but I just didn't feel her enough radiate through the screen. Music is definitely the highlight of the film, Ludwig Göransson is a freakin' genius. The entire film reverbs and vibes on a different level as soon as his BG score begins. My heart literally thumps and I got goosebumps whenever any music erupted. Editing is top notch again by Jennifer Lame. I mean to edit a Nolan film is no easy task. The film is tightly edited, there are no bogged down moments. You will always be on your toes and figuring out what will happen. That's where Nolan's writing also shines. To be actually fair, the music, editing and camera (Hoyte van Hoytema) lifts Nolan's screenplay several notches.Tenet is something that has to be experienced on the big IMAX screen. I don't think so it will be the same when you watch it on your tv and laptop. It's a wholesome experience. As it goes 'don't try to understand it, feel it.'"
2424,It was ok I guess but watching it was like trying to plait a loaf of bread with a thousand strands it was so confusing.
2425,This guy looks nothing like Denzel. Like not even a tiny bit. His good looks have not been inherited at all. But the movie was ok.
2426,"In a nutshell: an interesting plot but probably not the best Nolan movie. Terrible soundtrack, very loud and violating, my wife had to put her fingers into her ears and we both suffered from headache afterwards."
2427,"Nearly impossible to keep up with and follow the story line and time traveling, and didn't make much sense. I gave it a 5 for all the effort and thought put into it, along with good special effects, but I just couldn't get into the movie. I would skip seeing it, if I could ""reverse time."" lol"
2428,"Very good movie, even if it is confusing.If you can't understand the story which is not hard to do, then at least it delivers great action and visuals."
2429,"This is a true masterpiece. Don't bore yourself with the question on how, but just accept the alternative truth. Nolan is an artist when it comes to playing with time and places everything in a different perspective. If it wasn't for some too explanatory scenes - please don't insult your audience's intelligence - it would have been a homerun. Nonetheless, it immediately earned a spot in my top 10. A must watch!!"
2430,"I think, you have to watch this movie 3 times to understand, what is actully happening in each scene. If Nolans films will get more complicated too many viewers are lost. But me not. I want more from this. :) (very strange casting, with her 1,90m and him 1,75m hight)"
2431,"Went with my Thai girlfriend to see this - naturally our viewing had Thai subtitles.
Brilliant movie for action and production quality, no question.
Sadly, it was not enjoyable or entertaining to watch. I spent most of the movie trying to understand what the hell was going on and trying to keep up with Nolan endeavouring to piece together the premise of the story.There were many details that could have been left out to make and shorter film and, hopefully, people could understand it more.My girlfriend had the added confusion of having to read subtitles into the content mix. Can't see this film doing well in subtitled countries.I'll watch it a few more times when it comes out on DVD."
2432,"I saw ""Tenet"", starring John David Washington-Ballers_tv, BlacKKKlansman, and oh yeah, he is Denzel's son; Robert Pattinson-the Twilight movies, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, and oh yeah, he is the new Batman coming out next year; Elizabeth Debicki-The Cloverfield Paradox, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and Kenneth Branagh-Murder on the Orient Express_2017, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.
This movie is a real head trip. It is an original story-not based on any previous material-that is written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who directed Inception, the Dark Knight movies and Memento, just to name a few. John plays a C.I.A. agent that gets recruited by a mysterious new organization called Tenet. Robert is his new partner in this new spy club. Kenneth plays the villain that has some kind of precognitive powers that he uses to make himself a very successful bad guy. Elizabeth plays his abused wife and John decides to try to use her to get to Kenneth and stop him from destroying the world as we know it-like any good spy would do. There are scenes that are shown from different perspectives and you learn things about something that you saw in an earlier scene. I know that sounds a little weird but like I said earlier, this movie is a head trip and needs to be seen more than once in order to catch everything. In the movie, there is a term used a lot called 'Time Inversion' to explain the backwards and forwards jumping around in time concept. Tenet is also a palindrome-the same word backwards and forwards. If you like action/espionage movies with a little time traveling thrown in for good measure, then you should enjoy this one.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for action, violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 30 minutes.
I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu_Ray."
2433,"Unfriendly,too quick to understand,no good, lost many people"
2434,"Watched it .Still mesmerised. Christopher Nolan, take a bow. You need to watch it twice, though..."
2435,"First of all: I am a damn huge Chris Nolan Fan. Inception, Prestige, Dunkirk, Interstellar, everything great movies.
So Nolan wanted to make his own Bond here, but in Nolan style with some element of time.
Now lets talk about some pros and cons of this movie.PROS:
Ludwig Göransson. Just great, the trap elements a great and in the final confrontation he outdoes himself.Performances. No one really disappointed, espacially Robert Pattinson gives a good performance. But also John David Washington, Kenneth Branagh,...The experience. You have to watch this movie in cinema. It´s really something else with the good quality sound of IMAX. But also to just really feel it. It keeps you interested and it pushes you into your seat.Hoyte Van Hoytema. Nolan found his whats for Tarantino his Robert Richardson. Big or small images, everything is great and very tense filmed.The airplane scene.CONS:
The whole inversion thing. Like seriously wtf. The whole inversion thing was announced as the biggest thing of the movie and it was just meh. Hard to follow along and pretty boring (not the airplane scene).Characters are boring. The Protagonist gets no story arc, he is like us just there to learn what inversion and TENET is but it isnt very interesting.---
TENET is a great movie with good scenes and good perfomances. It keeps you interested and its funny at the right points. But it lacks and some big plot points and the characters are sometimes just there to explain the plot.
But still a good one, Mr.Nolan."
2436,"Layered and complex, but once you are able to connect the dots, it really was an awesome and creative story. Imagery and production was incredible as well."
2437,Enjoyed the film. Lived up to its expectations. Christopher Nolan does it again. If you enjoyed Inception you will definitely like this. A second viewing will clear up some confusion . Action was breathtaking . The only reason it didn't get 10/10 was sound mixing which was very surprisingly poor 4/10 for this !! Music score way way way too loud and some dialog need subtitles as it was bit muffled. Hence 8/10 score !
2438,"What to say. It's a typical Nolan picture. Epic, Confusing and just big in every way.
I don't know how he comes up with those stories every time. Tenet is another one where you need to concentrate to follow and where many things only make sence at the end of the film.
Pattinson and Washington are good as well.
Liked it."
2439,"Wow! Left the theater breathless!
This movie is complicated, and definitely needs a second viewing. Though it makes sense the first time, it only needs to be talked about and analyzed! Nolan uses all the cinematic tricks and delivers the best movie of the year!
Enjoy it!"
2440,"Around halfway I almost gave up trying to understand the plot, but the amazing shots and acting keep you drawn in. A fun and surprisingly not as ""deep"" movie about the complexity of time, but worth seeing even if to read all about after"
2441,"Good Movie with no time to get bored and loved the Way Nolan tied every question up thoughout the Movie. One could have.
And i was surprised by the performances by all the actors.
Go watch it."
2442,I think someone forced Nolan to make a movie based on their 16 yo stoner grandson's script. Another explanation could be that the film was originally going to be a 6 season series in which case there would be ample time to explain the massive logical gaps that exist in the film and character development would not be so horrendous. Mumbo jumbo with tons of Cgi (Cgi was awesome I must say ).
2443,Movie needs patients and its different from other Nolan's movies
2444,"To me:1. 9/10 because I felt it's missing something but I'm not sure how to describe it.
2. Whether it's his masterpiece or his best or not, never been so important.Good is good, bad is bad.
Won't be so complicated."
2445,The way this movie is formatted is spectacular and strange. Simply fantastic.
2446,"There's been a great deal of talk about the impenetrability of the plot of Christopher Nolan's latest blockbuster ""Tenet"" when, in fact, the plot isn't so much inpenetrable, (the 'plot' itself, for want of a better word, is actually quite simple and is spelled out in the first fifteen minutes or so), as sci-fi silly. This is another time travel picture but instead of time travel it's called 'inversion' which is really time travel by the back door so that about midway through the forward thrust of the plot takes a back seat and we start going back in time or maybe 'back to the future'; at least I think that was what was happening. To be honest, by now I didn't really care. I had long stopped trying to 'follow' the movie and was now just sitting back and enjoying every daft minute of it.Of course, it's not the first time Nolan has mucked about with 'inversion' or just played havoc with our perceptions of reality. ""Momento"" told its story backwards while I'm still puzzling over ""Inception"". This, you may argue, is cleverness for its own sake but I'm sure Nolan doesn't expect anyone to take a calculus or a set of algorithms into the cinema. He knows this is nonsense and he's just messing with us and messing with us on a supersonic level. First and last ""Tenet"", (oh, and the title's a palindrome, geddit?), is just a big, dumb-but-prentending-to-be-clever action flic with some of the most terrific set-pieces in years, (an 'inverted' car chase sets a new high). It's also got a deliberately cheesy script and some bravura tonge-in-cheek performances.If John David Washington is a little too insouciant as the hero, (or the protagonist as he keeps referring to himself), he's ably backed up by a superb Robert Pattinson as his sidekick, a terrific Kenneth Branagh relishing his role as the villain to end all villains, (please cast him in the next Bond movie), and a spunky Elizabeth Debicki as a time-travelling wife, mother and potential love interest. You don't expect performances of this quality in nonsense of this kind so let's just say they are a bonus. The final bonkers, saving the world from total destruction climax is over-extended and the movie tidies itself up a little too smugly but I'll forgive these minor blemishes when everything else is so much fun."
2447,"I wouldn't say there's a lot of beauty to see in the imax, but there's definitely the detail and the scenes themselves you'd want to see on a bigger screen. The concept is mind blowing and you definitely want to see this twice.
The only thing, that I wasn't sure about.. is it just us or the sound is off? We could barely hear actor's voices..
Other then that - brilliant!"
2448,"Amazing movie , I've really enjoyed every second of it .
outstanding plot with superb visuals , sound effects and music simply Nolan strikes back .
I didn't rate it 10 beacause I think it is complex for mainstream audience however it is super entertaining, for me this how cinema is all about"
2449,"Tenet on spectacle alone is as close to perfection as you can get. I truly believe that this movie ups the bar for ""Action Cinema"" as it stands today. But... incredible visuals cannot carry a movie alone. As for the plot and the story, I think they are of such a high scale, and a complex manner, it can be quite hard to follow. Although I didn't understand every little detail the amount of respect I have for Nolan, is as always INSANELY HIGH. He respects the audience in the way that he doesn't give them the full perspective on the story till far into the film. For some viewers Tenet will be confusing, maybe even a little bloated in the exposition department. But for the rest of us, Tenet is genuinely a remarkable experience, and one I can't wait to revisit time, and time again."
2450,"Brilliant film! Even though I had no clue on what was going on half of the time, but I read up on it after and now it all makes sense. Its crazier than inception and amazingly filmed. Acting was very good in it too!"
2451,"Spoiler:Better ending would be returning to the opening scene, where they would be the agressor to prevent the capture of 1 the algorithms."
2452,No Spoilers. Biggest problem is the sound. You can't hear the dialogue half the time. So you get lost. The end is good. But this movie doesn't need to be seen in theatres.
2453,"Yet again Christopher Nolan delivers as only he could with a really perplexing, mind-bending tale. Plenty was made of this film in the run-up to it's release and it should top the box office for the foreseeable future with a distinct lack of quality cinematic releases in the near future.One massive criticism of the film......It would be nice to actually here the dialogue. Too often i found myself in my seat trying to read the lips of the cast as the background music completely drowned out what was probably very important dialogue. Fortunately the dramatic action sequences really helped with the pace and movement of this story and made up for this really bizarre sound decision.All in all another really good addition to the Nolan library and come awards season i'm sure this Title will be topping plenty of categories."
2454,"Imagine Inception with more technobabble and big words that mean nothing to the average viewer. That's Tenet. Though, while they're alike in some ways, Tenet takes the mind-bending nature of Inception and turns it on its head. While Inception a visual spectacle, Tenet was a 'how did they do that?!' type movie. All performances were stellar, the camera work was spot on, stunts were mind-blowing at times, enough comedy to cover for some of the darker moments, and a soundtrack that threatens to match Hans Zimmer with Ludwig (I'm too scared to spell his second name), fresh off the iconic score to The Mandalorian. Do not go into Tenet expecting Nolan's best work. This is no Prestige, Dark Knight or Inception. This is something wholly unexpected and fresh, even if it is severely bogged down by the absolute nonsensical nature of the technicalities of the time."
2455,I'm a scifi fan and specially like time travel movies. But I couldn't make heads or tails of what was happening in this movie. I wish this was based on a book I could have read before watching the movie.
2456,"Alright, I get it. You're a genius and you make a story line so complicated that no one can understand a damn unless they watch it more than once, but I basically paid to get a headache.
With that being said, at least it's not boring (just exhausting) and everything is really well made."
2457,"REVIEW - TENETOk I'm going to say something quite controversial now, don't go to the cinema to see this film and save your money......read on.In a word WOW but a wow with one huge problem.A scientist invents a machine that can invert time, this machine was created in the future and an arms dealer somehow got hold of it.The arms dealer is in a failing marriage and decides if he can't have his wife then literally no one will, so intends to active the machine upon his death.A secret time agency exists which uses a similar machine to invert people in time which is used to go back and do right what once went wrong.Cross this all together with people moving backwards and forwards trying to stop the end of everything.As I've said above don't go to the cinema to see this because simply you may have to watch it 2 or 3 times to fully understand what is going on and why.Wait until this comes out on streaming and watch this film as many times as you must to fully appreciate the story.Rating 7 out of 10"
2458,Unfortunately this movie was visually stunning with no factual theory behind of what it was trying to tell the story! Where did the algorithm come from what made them be able to go through time there were so many questions and none of the answers.
2459,"Absolutely mindblowing movie, fantastically edited. MUST WATCH!"
2460,Very good movie and compex story line. It needs 2-3 times to fully understand the plot. Good action sequence. !
2461,Its sad for people who dont understand the movie to give low stars. If you have low iq watch cartoons.
2462,Very few movies have come out in theaters in recent years that have any level of complexity like Inception had 10 years ago. Tenet hit all those notes. The idea is so great that at first glance it is extremely confusing to watch for the first time. I've watched it three times now in theaters and it gets better every time. This is what makes a movie very good when you can watch it multiple times and not get bored. The dialogue could some work with the mix of music over lapping there voices but it really did good. Nolan has yet to make a movie that disappoints.
2463,"And shooting, kicking, explosions, car chasing and fires too taking a large parte os the movie and being the most important of it. Besides that what remains? The story? Oh yes the story is a rather superficial and simple one. The Protagonist, an uncharacterized CIA agent is summoned by a mysterious organization called Tenet to find and dismantle a gang of international espionage that has got technical knowledge and the means to provoke World War III and destroy the world. And that's all. You can sit down and watch this movie and be appalled by the lot of extremely violent scenes"
2464,"GRADE: CTHIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A visually stunning but emotionally inert action thriller about time travel, done in by a loopy screenplay.JIM'S REVIEW: Let me hereby state that I was totally confused by the storytelling in Christopher Nolan's widely anticipated action thriller, Tenet. Dazzling in its many well choreographed action sequences and technical showmanship, the film is in need of major rewriting to calm its overly complicated plotting. (Research states that the writer/ director sent 5 years re-envisioning his concept. Perhaps Mr. Nolan should have travelled forward to make some sense of his time-jumping narrative.) The film proved to be a minor disappointment for this reviewer.Tenet starts off promisingly with a terrorist uprising at the Kiev Opera House which serves no real purpose other than to wow the audience with a slick opening and introduces the film's protagonist, ironically called The Protagionist throughout the film, the first of many conceits. He is played by a rather bland John David Washington. The actor plays his action hero character with aplomb, but his line delivery and emotional range is lacking in any time frame. He befriends Neil (a winning Robert Pattinson). I truly thought that these two actors should have traded parts, which would have greatly enhanced this movie.This all leads moviegoers to a secret organization named Tenet whose chief mission is to stop a Russian megalomaniac named Andrei Sator from world domination. This cardboard villain doesn't even enter the movie until about 45 minutes into the movie and he is played with some over-the-top gusto by Kenneth Branagh. Sator's menace would make Goldfinger blush. The Protagonist also meets and becomes enamored by Kat, Sator's abused wife. She is played by Elizabeth Debicki in a breakout performance, serving up an icy Grace Kelly sophisticated but seriously damaged vibe.From there, we go to chases and heists that involve time shifts and reversals. Scenes literally move forward and backwards simultaneously which is an very intriguing concept and well executed too. You see, time is being inverted by a MacGuffin called Turnstile and it's up to the good guys to retrieve it and save the world. (A MacGuffin is an object that triggers the plot, a term popularized by Alfred Hitchcock in the 1930's.)No one can accuse Mr. Nolan of dumbing down his movie; quite the opposite effect occurs in this overly intellectualized time travel epic. Characters can't speak mere dialog. Instead they converse in very long patches of expositions about quantum physics and parallel dimensions in order to keep the audience informed between the jaw-dropping action. As some characters quip throughout the movie, "" We live in a twilight world"", as if to justify the gapping lapses of plot entanglements all through Mr. Nolan's screenplay. This isn't so much a non-linear story. Rather, it's a non-story with many action set pieces that are strung together to fill up an hour or two. But the essential plot is still loose and loopy, although the visual images are transfixing.Foremost, the stunt work and CGI are truly remarkable, some of the best work ever filmed. Kudos also go out to the inventive cinematography by Hoyte van Hoytema, a frequent collaborator with Mr. Nolan, Ludwig Göransson's tense-driven atonal score, and yeomanlike editing by Jennifer Lame. This film is sure to earn many awards for its technical brilliance and top-notch production values. Nolan's directing skills are bar none, it's his own writing that takes a hit.Tenet is an adrenaline rush of a movie...a visceral joyless ride brimming over with peril and action that unfortunately gets lost in its own ""twilight world"". In this upscale James Bond espionage wannabe film, one character astutely remarks, ""Don't try to understand it. Feel It."" That seems an apt advice in order to appreciate Tenet."
2465,"I thought it was a bit impressive. It just became really boring. Some of it was cool. I think the inverted part is just weird. It didn't make sense to me. Why invert something? Awkward.It was a cool spy movie, yet just boring and stupid. I thought the main character was cool, and his dialogue and some of the fight scenes were cool.Other than that, I would probably not necessarily suggest.It was okay. Perhaps worth a viewing.6 stars"
2466,Masterpiece of the year is an extremely brain-twisting work to see a lot to understand
2467,"We finally got it, Christopher Nolan's new film has hit theaters. The spy action thriller aptly named Tenet really has a lot to offer in its two and a half hours duration. He would say even a little too much for one average viewer. I believe that many will take it as flaw.
Tenet is certainly the most complicated film in Nolan's oeuvre, and that says a lot considering his films like Memento, Inception or Interstellar. The non-linear course of the action and playing with the fourth dimension of our universe - time, is present in all his films. Not only is Tenet no exception, but Nolan has gone even a step further. Many scenes in the film can be freely declared one of the most impressive scenes in film history precisely because of this manipulation of time and the way of shooting.
Let's start with the script first. Nolan wrote it for five years, worked on it, consulted how this concept would make any sense anyway. Lead actors John David Washington and Robert Pattison had to read it in Nolan's locked Warner Bros. office so nothing would leak out. Washington (otherwise the son of the more famous actor Denzel) read the script for a long time because he often had to go back to catch everything. The same thing was with Kenneth Branath who read the script several times. Michael Caine, who stars in almost every Nolan film, only got pages from the script that pertain to his character so he didn't even know what exactly the film was about.
This may not seem like much to you, but it matters to me because it talks about the effort put into the film to give viewers the best possible cinema experience. Contributing to this is the fact that the entire film was shot without a single scene containing green screen. The film contains 280 shots with visual effects (CGI added in post-production), which is below the average of a romantic comedy today. For comparison his Dark Knight has 650, Inception 500, Dunkirk 429 shots. So a lot of practical effects, shooting scenes several times and great engagement of actors in their roles. It all sounds amazing when you look at the final product and the scenes that look impressive and almost impossible to capture.
We see the great influence of the films about the most famous secret agent James Bond as we follow the main protagonist who tries to connect the dots (and the viewers also with him) and save the world.
Many will blame Nolan for the lack of emotion or character development, in addition to the complexity of the film, but I would not personally agree with that because there is less, but quite enough emotion considering the genre of the film.
The film certainly requires viewing on the big screen for the full experience, but it also requires re-viewing so that all the details that could have escaped at first viewing can be captured and appreciated. That's why the film gets a higher rating for me because it gives you the opportunity to watch the film from a different perspective a second time.
I intentionally didn't want to write anything about the plot for two reasons: the first is that it's so complicated I could write one longer text just to explain what it's all about, and the second reason is that I just don't want to reveal any spoilers for those who haven't watched to be able to fully enjoy the film.
Some of the criticisms directed at the director and this film can be understood, but I can by no means agree with them.
Tenet is a masterpiece of contemporary film art that puts us at the heart of the action from the first scene and doesn't let go until the credits at the end of the film. Enjoyment for ten!"
2468,"Before I went and watching it I read many negative reviews about it, but after I watched it myself it didn't disappoint me at all. And I will always be waiting and counting days till Nolan releases a new movie.
It's amazing and I loved it.
Love the plot, loved the action thoughout the whole movie and I wasn't bored at any moment.
Absolutely loved the climatic battele scene at the end, and the opening Operah scene as well.
And the soundtrack was great too and matching the rythem of the movie.
Christopher Nolan could release a movie discussing his skin care routine and I will definitely go buy a ticket and enjoys it. This man never disappoints me.
I'm not gonna compare it to inception or interstellar, but I enjoyed and had a great time watching it, I even dreamt about it the whole night after.
I wasn't really. a big fan of Robert pattison, but his performance encouraged me to go and see batman when it's released. I loved Neil so much"
2469,"This new big spectacle sci fi movie from Christopher Nolan (Interstellar, Inception, Dunkirk) offers up a temporal twist in a new guise that seems to become so wound up around itself that the movie turns into a sort of jumbled confusion and the redundant initial cuteness of the use of time in the movie loses its original compelling fascination. The contemporary television series Dr. Who dealt with time much better in terms of ease of watching it with more believable compelling understanding. A bold movie along with unfamiliar faces makes an original imprint on sci fi, but instead of a full-blown action sci fi thriller, it would have been more effective as a Solaris-type or Adjustment Bureau production. There was simply too much going on in terms of massive action thrills and over-reliance of special effects that the story couldn't handle well. To Nolan's credit, the movie avoided the typical overt sexual overtures and introduced an effective potent antagonist, one of the strongest and intense in a long time. In some ways Hunter Killer (2018) a powerful underwater, special ops action thriller would have been a great template for this movie Tenet to have followed."
2470,"If you go to a movie that makes you wanna watch it again, is because it's something special. Tenet is not perfect, but it makes you feel the magic of movies that we have been missing all year. Made by the Masters one and only Christopher Nolan, it will surprise with a great plot, fantastic music, and great visual effects that contain very little CGI.
Pay attention to every detail because it might just be a piece of puzzle. For sure going to watch it again. As everyone says, better on a second viewing."
2471,Nolan walked a million step backwards between Dunkirk and Tenet.
2472,"""Don't try to understand it, feel it.""Advice from a scientist in Tenet works well as you watch this sci-fi thriller from the acclaimed Christopher Nolan, who never could pass up a genre for his own take. His newest film is closer to his Inception and Memento, but for an intellectual romp, this time ""time travel"" is the fully operative motif.It's not helpful to have seen Back to the Future or Hot Tub Time Machine, for Tenet takes itself half seriously (e.g. the title is a palindromic bon-bon) as it explores the effect of the future on the present, or is it the other way around? See, even I'm confused while I still enjoyed Nolan's filmmaking chops so evident in cinematography and action set pieces.Nolan wants to play with the spy motif, and he succeeds. The Protagonist (John David Washington), as he is called in an unusually heavy-handed allegorical trope, is a secret agent type trying to stop WWIII. He has a Bondian deliciously bad oligarch, Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh), as his arch enemy and a sweet, albeit tall, femme in Kat (Elizabeth Debicki). Add world destruction as Sator's goal, and you have a template for Bond, Bourne, Kirk, and myriad other time and space traveling operatives.
The difference is that Nolan emphasizes the physics and philosophies of the conjunction of past with present as opposed to superficial gloss, although it has some mighty fetching eye candy at that. But the emphasis here is on the morality of messing with time and the temporal challenges with humans who must navigate it while entwined in love and hate and all that jazz.I'm not sure I can right now make this mind-bending adventure more thematically cogent. I do know that watching it in an AMC Dolby theater is a sensual joy while it is a brainy challenge of movie making at its most amusing and provocative.""All I have for you is a word: Tenet. It'll open the right doors, some of the wrong ones too."" Victor (Martin Donovan)"
2473,"One of the most confusing movies ever made, the story is so unique and original that it requires multiple sitting to gather every piece of information the film tries to unfold."
2474,"This is definitely a complex film in line with Interstellar and Inception and I feel that Nolan has to keep upping himself with each film. This one he over does the complexity and it requires several watches to fully grasp what's going on.This works with some people and is a disappointment to others. The characters and acting are actually good, however the sound mixing is way off and most of the dialogue is drowned out or muffled. I'm not sure how this obvious misstep wasn't fixed in preproduction, add in theater booming sound systems and this movie has several viewers covering their ears unable to understand any speaking parts. The musical score is nothing but loud bass noises.With a seemingly unlimited budget Nolan has and the fact that theaters are still dealing with virus fears this movie should have been delayed another 6 months and had the sound and editing cleaned up. It could have been a huge money film with a genuine 10 star rating. No reason to rush such and expensive project to an audience that can't/won't pay to see it and then see it with simple sound errors.Very poor management decision to release this."
2475,"Here we go again !
Another masterpiece from Nolan
It worth watching more than 3times
I wonder why you guys vote 1 for this movie, because whatever it is, it's Nolan's movie and needs time to be understood. If you have problems with sound mixing, wait till it releases online and watch it for second time, then vote. Masterpiece at all from my opinion"
2476,"At the end of the movie, i fell so confused! But the construction and sound are fantastic! Great choice of the actors!"
2477,"Stop right now and go and watch this film, you won't be disappointed.
My only advice is pay attention and don't be late."
2478,"DONT WATCH IF YOU DONT LOVE SCI FI
MULTIPLE VIEWINGS NEEDED
ALSO IF YOU ARE STUPID SHUT YOUR MOUTH"
2479,"I guess this movie could have been great. Potentially good actors, great director and an interesting premise of a story...And then we get to the reveal (like a 100 minutes into the movie). The future people want to kill the past people so that the past people don't destroy the climate and thus the future world. Ie, they believe that affecting the past WILL affect their future (see grandfather paradox). At the same time, they expect that erasing past humanity will still NOT affect their own existance...Which is it future people, do you belive in the grandfather paradox or not? You either stop the climate change AND erase yourselves from existance or you don't stop the climate change and get wiped out in the future. It's a lose/lose, just like the time and money spent on this film..."
2480,It is too complicated to understand this movie in just 2.5 hours
2481,Must see film! This film is easy to follow if you don't let it distract you! Open your mind!
2482,"Now it's just a ""flop"" because of the pandemic. I was watching it in almost empty cinema with only two other people present and I've watched films with all 50 % of seats occupied in this era already. The reversed or rewinded scenes make some impression at first, but after a while it just seems like they were running out of the film tape. The violance on screen is very naturalistic and graphic and there is just too much of it. The cinematography is unimpressive, the acting is average at best, the soundtrack is tiresome. The plot is all over the place, bad editing doesn't help. The dialogue is unintentionally hilarious sometimes. Branagh's performance is Razzie Award worthy and I hope he will be not overlooked at the nominations. Only the generally interesting, if not fascinating idea for a movie shows that Nolan may still have it in him after all."
2483,"It's hard to follow, impossible to understand all details but if you just get the general picture you will feel amazed about the idea. This script comes from a brilliant mind and cannot fit every mind. I saw people leaving the theatre and I felt sorry for them... poor minds!
My soul felt fed after this 2h30 hours of cinema. It's a couple of levels above Inception in complexity, smart as hell, original as never seen before but it's not for eveyone.
I liked the OST as well, I didn't knew who was the composer before watching and during the movie I thought it could be from Zimmer, so many parts inspired from his music."
2484,"I get it: Drugs are a great way to come up with a neat plot for a movie. But please revise your script when you are sober again.Minor sppoilers ahead!The film is full of contradictions and I didn't get much out of it. The first half tries to be some kind of espionage story, with random people going to random places to get random hints that do not contribute much to the story. It does not invite you to think along, since all conclusions are pretty much random. Shortly after the time-themed parts begin to unfold nothing makes sense anymore, but at least it all looks great. I honestly had no idea what the film is about, why exactly people are fighting and what they were trying to achieve. In Interstellar, although I might not grasp the physics behind everything, I still understood what was at stake and why the protagonists were acting as they were, but here it's all very random and nothing makes sense: Apparently you can affect a piece of time-inverted item into doing stuff that you will cause in the future, but it doesn't work later on, or it does not matter anymore. In the one second ""heat causes stuff to freeze"" (just for the cool effect that is), in the next minute it doesn't and it's all back to good, solid shooting and explosions. The idea of forward-time and backward-time were just not convincingly adopted and although I had the feeling, that there would be cool possibilities, none oft the ideas were not really exploited to an understandable or interesting level. I did not like the box-in-a-box-in-a-box theme in Inception, and in this case it is just a cover upCharacters and their relationships were totally random too, and I can't see why anybody thinks this was great acting. It is not. The actors often seemed to struggle to understand their relationships too. Their motives did not matter, nothing really mattered.The whole thing feels like being written stoned and there was no effort to fix the giant plot holes, instead it gets plastered with lots of action in the end. All in all an exhausting, long and pointless movie. It often feels as if nobody in Nolans team told him about the obvious mistakes the film makes."
2485,Once again Christopher Nolan amazed me by his another movie! Great Job By Team!
2486,"There are few movies I walk out of before the end.
Tenet is one of them.
I went through an hour and six minutes of absolute boredom and inability to achieve suspension of disbelief.
This is a movie that attempts to play on pseudo scientific ""tenets"" and fails miserably.
Avoid at all costs."
2487,"The first time you watch this movie it's gonna be a little confusing and might disappoint you. But second time it'll be totally different. You'd might be thinking trash at once but another masterpiece by Christopher Nolan at watching it twice.
At last, don't rate this movie if you didn't understand the physics behind it at first watch..."
2488,"Tenet is a huge mess made of bad writing, choppy plot, laughable dialogues and characters with no arcs. I can't believe this is a Nolan movie. ... It's the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life."
2489,"As this will be non-spoiler, I can't say too much about the story. However, what I can is this: Tenet's story is quite dynamic in the sense that you won't understand it till it wants you to. So, for the first half, your brain is fighting for hints and pieces to puzzle together the story. It isn't until halfway through the movie that Tenet invites you to the fantastic storytelling by Christopher Nolan.Acting is beyond phenomenal, and I'd be genuinely surprised if neither Robert Pattinson nor John David Washington doesn't receive an Oscar nomination for best actor. It's also hard not to mention how good Elizabeth Debicki and Aaron Johnson both are. All around, great acting, and the dialogue amps up the quality of the movie.The idea of this movie is damn fascinating, and while there are films that explore time-travelling, there's never been anything quite like this. It has such a beautiful charm and for the most part, explains everything thoroughly. It feels so much more complex than any form of time-travelling we've seen, and no less could've been expected from Nolan.Oh my lord, the score for this film fits so perfectly. Every scene that's meant to feel intense was amped by a hundred because of how good the score was. Let me just say though, none of them will be found iconic, but they fit the story and scenes so well.In the end, I walked out, feeling very satisfied. Nevertheless, I do have issues with the film that I cannot really express without spoiling bits of the story. There are definitely little inconsistencies that I found myself uncovering as the story progressed. However, I only had one issue that I found impacted my enjoyment. That issue was understanding some of the dialogue. No, not in the sense that the movie is too complicated, but more that it was hard to make out was being said at times. It felt like the movie required subtitles, but that probably was because, at a time in the film, there was far too much exposition.Nevertheless, I loved this film, I'll be watching it at least two more times, and I think most of you in this group will enjoy it. I definitely suggest watching it in theatres if possible, just so you can get that excitement."
2490,"As clever as the plot is after having watched the movie and then read about what you just saw, the simple fact that you can't make heads or tails about what's happening while you watch makes this movie an unfortunate miss for me. Ultimately I ended up coming away from it appreciating the plot but not the effort. Which is to say, I bet it would have been a good book, but it does not work as a movie unless you are prepared to watch it once going forward in time, and once in reverse to get all the stuff you missed - which is about half the movie."
2491,"Was a good movie, but you have to have your thinking cap on to watch it. Enjoyed Boss Level more, you just have to sit back and enjoy the fun."
2492,"It's crazy that it's been several months since I checked this film out in theaters (one of the few times I visited the cinema during the pandemic) and thought that this may signal the return for theaters overall. Of course, we know that wasn't the case, but I'm still not quite sure why I never reviewed Tenet back in August. Perhaps I was hoping to see it for a second time to help wrap my head around my feelings after the first viewing.I still to this day don't know how I feel about this film. I think it's still one of Nolan's weakest films (which to the normal director would be a massive compliment) but I was truly hoping for something spectacular here. To a certain extent, Nolan does give an incredible effort to reinventing certain aspects of filmmaking but was it truly enough? Will the mainstream audience think this film is too ""inside baseball"", yeah maybe. And even for a film nut like me, it is very dense and at times difficult to comprehend. But I would much rather be challenged than see the same old action film over and over again.With all that being said, it's hard not to hope Nolan goes in a new direction for his next idea. I'm not sure if it's adapting a book or someone else's original script (like he has done a few times) or just taking his scale smaller (like with The Prestige) but I'm still looking forward to whatever it is he does next. Here's to the future of filmmaking!8.2/10"
2493,"Insane writing and direction. Totally amazed me, how did he used the grandfather paradox. Banger"
2494,"Action / science fiction movie. A really pioneering idea in the sense of time as a dimension. With suitable devices one can not travel, but move backwards in time. He is reversed and others see him that way, but for him everything else is reversed. Huge and unique idea, highly complex script, and very rapid pace, requires the viewer to be concentrated all the time to fully understand everything. An action movie, which however in the first half was generally missing, and there were some characteristic directing mistakes. In the second half there were several reversed scenes and shot by both versions for the viewer to understand and solve some mysteries. The plot also had some nice twists. The actors were still too mediocre to make such a film, though not bad at all. The film, unprecedented and unique in its kind, could reach and become classes higher than Inception if it had top-class experienced actors to take it to a different level. A typical example could be the experienced in both action movies and emotion Will Smith and with a worthy co-star. Also, despite the complexity in the detail in the reversed scenes, huge mistakes were made in simple scenes, as if they were made in a hurry. I think that with top actors but also with more work in directing / dialogue or even a reduction of the first part which was quite boring in my opinion, it could be one of the top films of Nolan and the genre in general. However, the movie can not even touch the inception which has a relatively simpler idea to conceive, but in which excellent work had been done by both Nolan and DiCaprio. It is nevertheless a movie to watch again and again and one of the very good fantasy / action movies. Recommended to everyone.7.5 / 10 from me"
2495,"Being a Nolan Fan I was totally satisfied seeing the movie first time. What a plot and what an execution. Amazing.
You need to bend ur mind to go through it.
Fantastic job. That is why big fan of Nolan's work. Keeps closer to reality and plots it so nicely that u got to watch it again and again. Until u become a Fan.
Tenet gave a feeling bond movie as of the villain and word end game type scenario. Bond girl was also there.Worth and watch. And watch and watch. Lolzzz."
2496,"The first film to open in theatres worldwide in 2020 in the pandemic period clearly reflects the position of Nolan in world cinema, tauted to be Nolan's most ambitious project the anticipations were high. Where other big boys of world cinema surrendered to the streaming platforms for releasing their films, Nolan managed to get a theatrical release.
Tenet is a huge film , and also a comeback for Nolan to his favourite genre Sci-Fi. The film clearly shows the amount of effort and dedication the entire cast and crew have given to make this film. Hans Zimmer's absence was a disappointment as a composer but Ludwig Goransson has not only filled that void but also shown brilliance in not imitating Zimmer but creating his own enigma which has elevated the experiece of watching the film. The film technically is brilliant but as I said the cons are in the pros,the editing is abrupt which restricts the audience to involve with the characters. The characters are not to root for but just to merely follow except Elizabeth Debicki's character
who has the only emotional arc in the film. There is a line in the film ""Don't try to understand it, feel it"" but the film is the complete opposite of it ,you would to have to re watch it couple of times to understand it and after you have,the film looks great but you will feel like solving a complex equation only nothing more. The impact of the film is short-lived because the characters are distant so one will not feel their urge to do whatever they are doing in the film .The film has also the weakest ending in a Nolan film just like Dark Knight Rises which also suffers from a bad third act. Like Inception ,the film involves several cities but unlike the former the flavour of cities or even the transitions between them are hardly noticeable. The absence of a proper back story, a clear objective made this film a mere andrenaline sci-fi spectacle,you will enjoy it while you are watching but after a few hours or days it will be a distant memory.
The concept of time inversion involving thermodynamics is properly used in the film, the minute details in that department is genuinely appreciable, the action sequences are well choreographed and executed. Hoyetma Van Hoyetma has done a great job as a cinematographer. James Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki gave the strongest performances in the film.The opening sequence of the film will really vibe you for an immersive experience and particularly reminds me of the scene when Bane raids a rugby match in The Dark Knight rises. The film is clearly not one of the best of Nolan but still very expertly made and executed."
2497,"Christopher Nolan has sub-passed himself. ""Inception"" was original, brilliant, ingenuous, absolutely overwhelming, surpassing everything he had done before. ""Tenet"" is a muddled mess, totally underwhelming.The fault is in his attempt to tackle temporal displacement, something I wish he had stayed away from. H.G. Wells in 1895 gave the world ""The time machine"", the first glimpse of what can be done in the entertainment universe with the concept of time-travel. From Isaac Asimov, the world of entertainment fiction had the authoritative last word on the paradox of time travel, ""The end of eternity"" published in 1955. Since then, none of the proliferation of material on time travel, be it written or filmed, offered anything new, let alone ground-breaking. ""Tenet"" is no exception.""Tenet"" would have been a very entertaining 007 thriller, well-acted and extravagantly filmed. It is all but ruined, from about midway through, with mumbo-jumbo double-talks that might have been intended to impress the audience but end up being a nuisance of a distraction.John David Washington, who served notice in ""BlackkKlansman"" (2018) that he belongs to the big league, further consolidates his position with this movie. Robert Pattison, who has come a long way since debuting as the heart-throb vampire in the ""Twilight"" franchise, has proven that he can do just about anything on the screen, may well be the actor you would enjoy watching most in this movie. Elizabeth Debicki, who first got my attention in her role as Jordan Baker in ""The Great Gatsby"" (2013), plays a role here that is strikingly similar to her character in the TV mini-series ""The night manager"" (2016), a damsel-in-distress kind of wife to the prime villain, whose entire life is her pre-teen son. Neither has given her much room to showcase her acting talent. The biggest name in the cast, Kenneth Branagh, is somewhat of a disappointment as the villain."
2498,"I'm gonna keep it short and simple. TENET felt emotionless and cold on my 1st viewing, but the 2nd viewing changed everything! I felt totally invested with the characters, the plot was easier to follow and the ending really hit me hard. It's pretty lame to see people jumping to conclusions about this film after their 1st viewing, complaining about the plot being too complex. TENET will go down as a classic! Freakin loved it!"
2499,"Nolan has always been obsessed with the concept of time and how to manipulate it, and we have seen this in most of his films, in Memento and in non-sequential events, chronology, in Inception, and time difference according to dream layers, in Interstellar and the expansion of time through relativism, in Dunkirk and the difference of time. Between an hour, a day, and a week. But in Tenet we find the concept of time inversionThe movie Tenet plays on the strings of a new and unique concept that is totally unexpected in the cinema, and as usual in his previous films, Christopher Nolan needs you here also a lot of focus and accuracy of observation in order to keep pace with this concept on which his film is based.In my personal opinion, there is a difference between the deep and the complex. The deep is the one who ""drags"" you into the artwork, as if you are an inseparable part of what you see and see, but rather forces you to interact with it.As for complexity, I think it is a technical process related to the way of narration and treatment that the artist provides in his work. Complexity may be related to the structure and construction of the film. This is what I know and understand. The truth is Nolan's method of directing combines the two sides, although the complexity is a little more than the depthI think that this new Nolan narrative does not propose ideas such as the relativity of time, the meaning of its becoming, or ... or ... but it is primarily a celebration of the free will of man, and the ability of that will to challenge the rule of time and the process, and even the ruling entropy of the world, but this great, unique and distinctive structure contained Also, there are major contradictions, which some may see as defects and see them as advantages. A person lives these intellectual contradictions in the real world every day, and yet he continues his life, and their presence in Nolan's movie is only a reflection of this reality that we do not understand!"
2500,I've seen better acting in BangBros productions! And can we turn up the dialogue in the audio mix? Can't understand 90% of what's being said.
2501,"This is the way to do it. To make a truly great movie - in the sense of Entertainment. Thank god someone in this present world knows how to make Great Entertainment in the field of movies. (other fields, theatre, music etc require a different genius. Of course you may have to be involved or inserted or instituted or inspired in this dimension of time/space and those who have the joy and freedom can merely sit back and enjoy the ride of many levels of reality without concern, allowing it all to unfold itself as it will. Yes the quantum dimension. The Rod Serling dimension. Open your head with the scalpel, set the noodle on the table, take what you need or better, nothing, and let the show begin. Mr Nolan, Thank you! Now, if you'll excuse me, I do need to get back to the future, where I lived."
2502,"Whatever has happened will happen. This is kind of similar to what Dark series is. The only thing tenet added was reverse gravity and tried to make it more complicated by speaking fast and using loud sound effects. Frankly if you watch it in your home with subtitles on you won't find it difficult to understand.
People can go in the past and try to do things differently, only catch here is they will feel the wind and pedestrians going backwards. That's it.
But of course the story is really good which is always nolan's strong point and plot is the most important thing for me too.
Also the protagonist is extremely boring. Rob pattinson was much more interesting despite being a supporting cast. I don't know what he did in the auditions to get this role but he is bland."
2503,The whole movie was a tad too confusing. Not too easy to follow. Which is why kind of more and more lost interest in the process of watching the movie....
2504,This film makes Inception look like Inception. You need to watch some YouTube videos on inverting theories etc just so your mind doesn't tangle when watching this film. You'll need to watch this a couple of times like Inception just to get your head around the concept. Then after the 4th or 5th time you can see things and connect things in the film. Can't wait for this to come out on dvd (I know so 2005) or whatever but I will be watching this a number of times.
2505,Amazing script and amazing corrector i think it is one of the best movie
2506,"It's weird how in all of Nolan's movies the soundtrack is a positive point but in Tenet it was the complete opposite, it was annoying and distracting for the most part, really disappointed in that regard"
2507,After watching inception I'm fan of christopher nolan. This movie is also kind of inception but in this there is time travel and so much complicated story that many have to see it in forward and backward form . I love this movie so much wow amazing movie. The movie that you can compare with inception. Totally amazing.
2508,"Everyone must take into account the art that is put into the movie. The plot, the acting, the cinematograohy, the soundtracks, etc. It's sad to see Tenet not having at least a rating of 8.0.Well of course, not understanding a movie yet spending 2 hours on it is really not satisfying. But in my opinion, Nolan's movies are not there to satisfy anyone; they are there for those who will spend their time to understand and feel the movie, ane appreciate the art! Inception is not meant to be satisfying; it is a masterpiece that must be lived with. Here is the same.Interestingly, after watching Dark, I didn't face much difficulty understanding the movie. Surprisingly, both have a lot in common! Time loops and people who try to save someone and prevent events from happening, yet being the reason that event happend in the first place...So I suggest everyone to train their mind and get ready for these types of complexities before trying to understand them, and must spend enough time to get everything together.I personally enjoyed every part of it. Perfect action scenes, amazing acting, cinematography, soundtracks, and mysterious plot. Loved it! Hope you like it too!"
2509,"This is Written And Directed By Christopher Nolan. So,This is confirmed that the film is not Simple ,First Of All.Then Come Great Visual With Great Editing And The Story is Good and Complex.You Can't Understand in First Time.
Film is Great Overall. I am Big Fan of Christopher Nolan."
2510,"I really had high expectation when Nolan introduced us with his new work called Tenet. Turn out it becaming the worst Nolan movie I've ever seenAs always, Nolan gives us some unique and complex story whenever he write a movie. When they executed this kind of story really well, it really is become a masterpiece, such as Interstellar and Inception. But not with Tenet. The story in this movie feels really dragged out, even with 2,5 hour long. Characters are probably the worst here. They just mumbling the line without expressing any emotion. It feels like there is no 'real character' in this movie. The music are also too loud in some scenes.Some people said that you will appreciate this movie even more after you try to rewatched it. I don't know, they probably right about that. But for me, after my first time watching this movie, it really is not that good."
2511,"Nolan once said in an interview that he was jealous of the freedom that those in the fields of literature have enjoyed in the past and 'we do not have those freedoms as a filmmaker'. This film does more than what any literature could have ever done. Rating this 7.7 and Inception 8.8 just shows how convinient it is to accept a simple but innvoative story such as Inception to be great, but not Tenet which challenges your intellectual capability.Never heard before concepts that Nolan introduces in the film are Inversion of objects and people, temporal pincer movement, shooting fighting sequences from two different perspectives of time - one in reverse and one linear. Nolan uses every trick of filmmaking to give himeself the freedom that the literary folks enjoy without having to execute their ideas in reality.Someone wrote that this film would have been thrown away after 10 pages by any producer if it was not Nolan's. He is probably right but it is just because you cannot see this film in a script. It is one of those films that can only be expressed in the form of a film, not a novel or a comic,Now coming to the cast of the film, it was such a brave move to cast John David Washington in a seemingly Bond-type movie, when the Bond franchisee itself has been reluctant to cast any African American. He conviniently didn't use any of his past characters except for Sir Michael Caine who is basically a totem of Nolan's world. Even the antagonist, who is not like the Joker or Bane, has acted well enough as a misogynistic vengeful chap.Overall, if you think this film needs a one more go or some reading on it, then do it. I am pretty sure even though Prestige looked pretty simple to you, if you haven't watched it more than once, you haven't got it yet."
2512,"Big Nolan fan, but this one's a misstep. Not sure how he could've got it so wrong, other than he tried to get far too intellectual and reinvent the time-travel concept. But he's really failed here. Yes, the film is beautifully shot and well-acted, but the script itself is a mess. In parts it's utter gibberish, poor dialogue, tedious, the characters are paper thin with little to no development, and the audience is given nothing to care about...nothing in the entire 2.5 hours. The opening doesn't even set the movie up well; it's just so cold and superficial from the start. I hope he reflects on this one and goes back to the basics for his next."
2513,Another masterpiece by Christopher nolan.what an amazing movie
2514,"The best visuals in cinema you will see - ever. Although it is one of the most beautiful films to watch, its complex story has certainly gone one step too far this time. We could have done with something light-hearted and not overly complex to come out of lockdown and return to the theatres. But no. Such a dense and intricate blockbuster, but not well executed like other Nolan movies. I think the bar has been set so incredibly high for Nolan (for good reasons) and now a movie like this is not good enough for most cinema-goers.
In my opinion he has made one of the best pieces of Event Cinema to date, utilising incredible music, 70mm IMAX film and a story we don't have a clue about. You must also watch it twice so that you understand it and either way you are going to have an absolute thrill back at the cinema!"
2515,"From the maker of classic films like Memento, The Prestige, Batman series, Inception, Interstellar and Dunkirk, Christopher Nolan's latest James Bond meets the time-bending action thriller is the first Hollywood release ever since the lockdown prevented us from entering the theaters. Tenet has opened across India today. Will it be as enigmatic as Nolan's previous work ?Tenet tells the story of CIA agent (John David Washington) who gets exposed in a rescue operation at the opera house in Kyiv. He is quickly sent on a mission to prevent the World War III from occurring after passing some test (which is not explicitly explained). During the mission, he finds out process of inversion where a person or object can have its entropy reversed. As he investigates, he travels across the globe to meet people - Neil (Robert Pattinson) who supports him and Priya (Dimple Kapadia) who is arm dealer and gives him a clue about Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh). He also meets Crosby (Michael Caine) who tells him about the abandoned city which is the crux of all the events.While half of the world had already seen the Christopher Nolan's mega event film, India will witness the much awaited action flick today in theaters. The reason I mentioned ""much-awaited"" since Nolan has set a huge fan base in India as his films have done very well. As a fan of his films, Tenet has some marvelous action scenes - the combat scene at the gallery and we get to witness the backward movement again after sometime, the car-chase on the highway is excellent as we witness one of the toppled car come back to its original form adequately supported by Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography which captures each and every frame beautifully and Ludwig Goransson's background score, which gives a feeling as if there was some issue with the audio background score but later settles for good (you will definitely miss Hans Zimmer though).Though the editing is sharp, the film's length definitely could have been cut with few unwanted scenes. Writing by Nolan is clever as he always uses the world of physics, mythology, flip between past, present and this time future events together. However, there is something missing as Tenet ends its high-dose climax sequence and the movie closes with a twist. I also felt the emotional touch was not there like Nolan present us in Inception (mind-blowing background score and plane scene) and Interstellar (when father finally meets his old daughter).Coming to the performances, John David Washington was passable as his expressions were same through out the film. Robert Pattinson did a fine job and was a delight to watch. I loved Dimple Kapadia as she confidently performed in probably her first international project. Kenneth Branagh as villain and Elizabeth Debicki, playing his wife, were good.Overall, Tenet is a solid attempt by the master Christopher Nolan. It definitely loses the bus but the concept, action scenes and thrilling fight sequences makes it up for a nice watch. Good 3.5/5"
2516,"The best and awesome movie watched in my life.it gives you a journey like roller coaster.that scene in fight that it is edited and directed,how can it be so perfect with so much confusion.it needs to be on top.thank you nolan for this movie and entertainment,if possible make a sequel of this like dark night .
The sound and background score is one of the best ,although it is not scored by hans zimmer yet a fantastic work."
2517,One of the most complex screenplay i have ever seen in film. Jennifer lame did fantastic job.
2518,"As a fan of this kind of movies am a little confused; from the point of view of time theories I think the story is well written on the other hand I know ""what's happened is happened"" that's for sure but from the events in the film you can't know the details of the whole story; the acting is just good but it doesn't matter as it's not the major part here; Nolan made a very good job too as always; finally I Definitely needs a re-watch to have more much fun."
2519,"Not sure if I liked it or disliked it. Maybe I had to be more concentrated.
It reminded me a lot with inception for Leonardo Di Caprio"
2520,"Another Nolan movie for theoretical physics majors, wow! I have absolutely no idea wow he filmed this. No way to casually watch it, you really need to pay attention or you will get lost in a hurry. Some parts of the plot I liked, but I was not impressed by the lack of technical exposition about how it all worked. Will probably have to watch it again to figure out what I missed lol."
2521,"Do not Waste Your Time on this movie
The subject matter of the film was relatively good, but the artificial actors made an artificial film"
2522,This is one of the best movies I've ever watched. You have to watch it multiple times and and paying much attention every time to understand the movie.
2523,"First of all, the CGI is quite good!The rest is questionable! Perhaps someone could contact Kip Throne for help...I have a PhD degree in astrophysics and I have difficulties understanding the theories behind the plot the so called ""algorithm.""1. How can you move forward in a reversed universe? By putting on a stupid mask? I don't think so!2. How can you shoot someone in a reversed universe? The bullet will get ended up in your gun eventually, isn't it?3. A nuclear explosion will destroy the world? Where did you go to school Mr. Nolan?4. The actress is so much taller than all the major male actors, she is like a GIANT, are you out of your mind Mr. Nolan?"
2524,"Time, space and a huge amount of creativity in a time travel adventure where each action has a purpose.Just like wine, it tastes better after long time... in this case, the movie gets better after each watch...Welcome to an inverse journey!! Enjoy"
2525,Can't keep up with Inception. But keeps you attentive throughout. I would surely recommend theatrical experience twice but not once
2526,"Wow. Where even to start with this film. What this throws at you, the themes Nolan's working with, the sheer ingenuity and clinical perfection he brings to this project is without a doubt going to be a source of sheer pleasure for all film lovers.Do not want to give too much away, but what Nolan accomplished here, is perhaps the equivalent of what Stanley Kubrick acheived for his generation with 2001: a Space Odyssey. Such is the brilliance, the audacity brought to the screen by the master Christopher Nolan.The movie is by no means a piece of cake to understand. It demands your attention, and it deserves every bit of it too! It makes you work for it, the more you do, the more you unravel and try to understand it, the more it gives you in return. There's layer upon layer of theories, and gems buried in the film, and each thing you discover, be it about the plot, or even the character names, and how everything's intricately tied together, gives you the joy i must imagine an archaeologist gets when it discovers an important landmark of history after excavating a site.It truly is a blessing for those who love film to be living in an age where we get to wittness the sheer cinematic marvels Christopher Nolan crafts for us."
2527,I'm a huge Nolan fan and I highy recommend you watch it.
2528,"Wasn't a bad film.. have seen worse recently, actors were good and the scenery and effects were decent, once you got the gist of it, it was quite obvious, the films all about forward and backward times, so you'll see the same thing twice from different perspectives. This was cool, however got boring after a while.Bad guy was mediocre, for what he wanted to do, no-one no matter the pay scale would be part of his regime? World Domination? Yes. World Destruction? Count me out."
2529,"Tenet, like Inception, is a very creative sci-fi. But in Tenet, unlike Inception, you will just understand what's happening but not absorb it. When you absorb something you wouldn't have to consciously analyze what's happening and carefully interpret every word the characters say, it all becomes an instinct, like driving a car.In scientific publishing, one of the main objectives is to write one's findings in as simple a way as possible and provide a sufficient amount of introduction so that the reader has developed an intuition for the stuff by the time the main findings are presented (I should know I am a scientist). But this sci-fi movie presents the main ingredients in such a rushed and messy way that it takes away the fun of watching a movie by forcing the viewer to put them all together even near the climax as if by consciously processing the steps of a long math problem. Everyone will understand what's happening, but at the cost of not enjoying it. And also movies are not books, you don't get to reread or pause whenever you want. So a movie, by design, has to either dumb down things or not present too many things. Tenet tries to present too many things and not in an easily perceivable form (like all the plans and the lingo).Another thing that bugged me a lot is that the movie does not spend enough time on reverse time flow in the beginning. There is just one scene at a wall in the beginning that's the whole Tenet world building in the movie. This is the main reason why the subsequent big things fail to impress or rather register at a deeper level (like in matrix or inception).Nolan has misfired twice since Inception now, Interstellar had a daft climax (I mean love in a sci-fi, I am still p**sed off about it) and Tenet was even worse (because Interstellar can be enjoyed until the very end). Hope the writing gets better in the future and we get another Inception or Prestige."
2530,"At first I was wondering why the rating of currently 7.8, and even when the movie came out, I was puzzled as to why it seemed many were somewhat down on it. After being halfway through it currently I understand. It would be extremely hard to like in a theater overall probably. Mainly because alot of the dialogue is muffled very badly. I wonder if it was done purposely. It had to be with so much detail put into the movie itself. Also, with a movie of this type it definitely has to be paused or re watched to fully appreciate it's gravity. I tend to think the average viewer isn't too interested in that overall, nor do they want to think at the level this movie requires.To me it's a masterpiece of cinema for folks who like thinking, thrillers, action, and heist based movies. I'm not so sure the general public is big on those movie types. I say that because movies like The Town which is a GREAT film, has a solid rating, but not as many reviews as other movie types. Inception which was great also had big name recognition to carry it, and I think the female presence helped it in ways Tenet might suffer overall. Some times great art isn't appreciated by the masses, and I think that will be the case with this one. I tend to think it will do very well once it's available for home viewing. I see it as an adventure. It's perfect for what it is."
2531,"I do not think that I will remember this film in the future because it is weak on many levels, the first half of the film was very good and coherent, but after that it was chaos and it entered a fast and incomprehensible rhythm to me on events. I think I will only see it again because I think I can pick up some of the things I might have missed it"
2532,"I was quite supprised when i watched it. there was a lot of talk before the movie came out. i wouldnt say that i love it or hate it, but it was something differend. I like to see something new, new ideas ..... and the actor, i liked him before in Ballers.one note. duration of the movie is maybe to long for my taste and you have to watch it very well because its hard to understand."
2533,"Alright so I finally got to see Tenet and here are some of my thoughts on the film. This, being a Christopher Nolan film, offers an absolutely incredible theater experience. Feeling the bass of the score on the floor, the loud gunfire, the incredible image, it offers one of the most immersive experiences out there. The cinematography here is incredible, and the fight choreography is so impressive. I'm assuming most of you know about the ""inversion of time"" stuff in here and the movie incorporates that so well, and it's even more impressive just how much if it was actually done practically (this IS Christopher Nolan after all). The movie is long, but it is very entertaining and doesn't really drag. I wouldn't say it's to the levels of Inception or The Matrix where time absolutely flies by, but it's still very entertaining. As for the plot, this is probably Nolan's most complex yet. It was on a whole different level compared to Inception or Interstellar, it's basically Primer levels of complex here (but of course Primer takes a mathematical and logical approach to time while Tenet takes a cinematic approach). Although it can be very daunting at first, as the movie goes along things make more sense and it all really starts to come together in a clearer way. I would definitely need to watch this several more times to understand it all, but that wasn't much of a problem to me as I've already learned through various movies that simply understanding everything isn't always the point. Tenet delivers all the spectacle that Christopher Nolan is known for, and it could very well be his biggest movie yet. There certainly isn't anything else like it. All that being said, I'd say there's one flaw that really sticks out here. The spectacle and scope get so big that Nolan sort of forgets about the human side of things. This was basically my main fear going into the movie, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it might be.
There IS a human story in here, and it has some incredibly human moments, but I think these moments are really lost. I think some more time could've been dedicated to really fleshing this out, and creating not only an awe-inspiring huge spectacle experience, but a story packed with humanity and emotion (see: Interstellar). I think that this is pretty common with filmmakers like Nolan, as they go on moving away from their small scale human narratives and just keep getting bigger in scale they forget about that emotion. Like I said, the movie has a little bit of that emotion but honestly I wouldn't mind if the run time was cranked up even more to make more room for those emotions and make this a true epic. In the meantime, I'll probably be trying to figure out the plot of this move, and I 110% recommend you going to the theater to get that experience. 8.3/10."
2534,"I go to movies often, but after this movie in the threatre, I have tinnitus (2 months and going) no joke. The movie was pretty awesome but the treble is like glass breaking nonstop next to your ears. I have a white noise that constantly there unless I listen to music/game etc. I am 100% serious. I wish I brought earplugs or just left the threatre after the intro. I think I will no longer watch movies at threatres because you have no control on volume. This is a warning, wear earplugs or leave."
2535,"I'll start by saying I enjoyed the movie thoroughly, and even with only a semblance of understanding the plot as the credits hit the screen, I understood enough of the overarching story to enjoy the characters and their adventure without understanding the intricacies of how the plot really comes together.
Robert Pattinsons Acting was a highlight as well as certain scenes with 'reversing elements' so to speak.
There is however something to be said about a movie that 'challenges' it's audience to understand it, (often through multiple watches) and where some will think it's bold, others will think it's just rubbish.
Normally I would be inclined to the latter as I've always thought a truly great film: well written, directed and edited can only ever be just as good the second time around...
Films the likes of the Sixth Sense, Donnie Darko or even Nolan's own Inception have commonly been touted as films that get better the more you watch and understand, but I beg to differ, stating that the true brilliance of a film lies within its mystery and reveal. It's the tension and suspense on that first viewing that can never be replicated on further viewings. That is to say the removal of said suspense in lieu of noticing clever moments of foreshadowing in any other subsequent viewing belies the point of any foreshadowing in the first place.
I'm not saying there isn't an art to building a narrative in such a way that prior knowledge and hindsight can make subsequent viewings fun, but in a way these moments can't exceed an initial perception as they serve only to remind the viewer of their first watch, in effect bringing them back to the first time they watched it reigniting those same emotions they felt with a form of nostalgia.
The trouble with Tenet is that the first viewing experience is muddled and unclear. Only after sitting down with a pen and paper drawing out parallel and convergent timelines of multiple characters (it's just the one timeline actually) did I actually ""get"" the plot, and even then a quick read of reddit forums didn't hurt my understanding of the film.
What I'm saying is, I enjoyed this film...
It was rapidly paced and edited with some very impressive sequences, but it was also challenging from a narrative perspective to the degree that it was very nearly beyond my patience. So if this sort of film isn't your cup of tea I'd probably give this one a miss, but if Nolan's over-complication of story structure (that's become something of his oeuvre) doesn't bother you, then there is a compelling and interesting sci-fi story hidden underneath."
2536,"To understand this, you need to be in the Matrix and take every colour of pill going :-(.
I get it, and there are some good action scenes
Now Kenneth Branagh is a Classical Actor, he does plays, he is a quality actor, but his accent was just dreadful
If you are watch this a few times, which in these times is not easy, you might enjoy it.
I understand what they are trying to do, but it's still a bit Nuts
But keep Christopher Nolan away from 007 :-)"
2537,"I'm a Christopher Nolan fan and love his movies but Tenet is way too complicated to be ""fun"". Plot was all over the place and it was hard to keep up...if you wanna watch it wait till it's on Netflix."
2538,Amazing film. Lots of action. But I admit for me it is hard to take everything in. Certainly a mind bender. But looking forward to seeing again to try and absorb more details.
2539,"I found the concept intriguing and special effects were exceptional, I'm sure much work was put into it. But although all of it was intriguing, it was delivered in an overconfident and heavy-handed manner. I feel for Chris because I'm not smart enough for his vision.I understood the main plot maybe nearing the end, so before that I was mostly confused, so, I get it, but... and it is a big but, a big big but. I did not get invested in the characters, I felt very little for them, and the climax of the last 30 minutes was a torture, because frankly, it was boring, not interesting, whatever you call it, I call it boring.Now the consensus is that we have to see it more than once. Which means renting is a better option, also you will benefit greatly from a pause button. So it makes sense to see it once in the theatre for the eye candy then forget about it till the bluray will come out, yep! Or if you're not a huge fan of big screen eye candy then it's not that important, and you might even want to skip it altogether."
2540,"I am tired of seeing movies with the same concept over and over again like time travel. The only thing Nolan changed is how time travel is perceived, but the concept is nothing new..The movie started great and I was hopping to get something new, exciting somekind of plot twister.. but no... time machine stop the bad guy type of movie..I mean the actors were all great except the main hero which keeps a straight face the whole movie. The visuals,A nolan movie, amazing as always... The script started out great, but how simplistic of an ending did Nolan deliver..I mean I am giving it a 7 because its better than most trash out there, but seriously.. The prestige, Inception and Memento were way more absorbing in terms of plot twisters than this film.."
2541,"Probably Nolan's most confusing film but I was digging it. Nolan once again knocks it out of the park in the technical category. All the practical effects here are amazing. Especially the plane sequence and the war sequence. I'm genuinely impressed and curious about how he was able to do some of this stuff since the movie deals with time inversion. There's a lot of stuff going forwards and backwards in a scene and I really want to know how Nolan did it. The cinematography is fantastic as always and the score is great. Hans Zimmer is missed here but I think Ludwig Göransson did an excellent job doing his own thing while also throwing in elements of Zimmer in there too. The editing can feel a little bit awkward at points but it's good for the most part and the sound editing is great. The only issue in the technical category I have is the sound mixing. Unfortunately, Nolan decides to turn the mixing up a little too loud during important scenes and it can be hard to hear what some of the actors are saying. Speaking of actors, almost everyone here does a great job with John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, and Elizabeth Debicki being standouts. There isn't a lot of depth to their characters which can mute some of the emotional weight at points but it wasn't a huge issue for me. The plot is unique and different but definitely is incredibly confusing and will most likely require rewatches to fully comprehend it. If you are a fan of Christopher Nolan or want to see something in theaters, I urge you to check this out."
2542,"As well as being visually spectacular, as only Nolan knows how, and married to amazing music, the characters I thought were really well developed (though my wife would disagree).The sound track is intense with gun shots that actually sound loud compared to the dialogue, (which in so many films has been compressed to death to the point everything sounds as loud/quiet as everything else and all sense of dynamics has been lost). Also the vocals are reasonably coherent by the standard of Nolan movies, so do expect some mumble. Music-wise the ratcheting synths/samplers, fluid time signatures and dramatic composition make me think Nolan has found another composer for when Zimmer is busy.The plot requires some suspension of belief and after reading previous reviews I was quite please with myself to get 3/4 of the way through stage and still understand what was going on, however the last 20 mins threw me a curve ball. Will have to watch it again - like I did with Inception - to see if it makes any more sense.Overall it was very entertaining and would recommend to those who enjoyed Inception or Interstellar."
2543,"Although it is an action-packed fast-paced blockbuster action movie, the plot is way too convoluted to understand even by phd-holders in natural sciences. Inception's plot was easy to understand compared to this one. I guess that this whole story merited at least a 10-partshort series on Netflix instead of this abbreviated and way too condensed rollercoaster for the big screens."
2544,This movie is like the Edge of Tomorrow the protagonist has to keep going back to get information and fix the past each time to stop the world from ending. The difference is that in this one there is a paradox so when they go back in time they need to make sure they dont run into themselves. The special effects and imagery are very cool. Some parts got so loud in the Dolby digital screen that I had to put in my earbuds. I thought I would not understand it the first time but I believe I got the point about half way through. I will definitely watch it again soon to figure out what I may have missed then reevaluate my review.
2545,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Director Christopher Nolan serves a cerebral plate of action and sci-fi intrigue, perfect for those who loved the brain-scratchers Inception and Interstellar. The director is a huge James Bond fan, which shows in the film. He intentionally did NOT watch any Bond movies while he worked on this film but chose to rely more on the feeling he remembered he got from watching them.At a budget of $205 million, this is Christopher Nolan's most expensive film and the first major studio film to be released during the Covid-19 pandemic.This is one of those movies you have to watch twice to fully appreciate. The more you understand it, the more you appreciate it.TIPS FOR PARENTS:

RealityTHINGS I LIKED:
The movie starts off with a bang...literally.
I love movies that play around with the concept of time. The working title for this film was ""Merry Go Round.""
John David Washington was an athlete in college, so his physicality for the action scenes was completely believable. He said he could hardly run for a month after filming. I thought he was excellent in the movie Blackkklansman. You can see my review of that film here. Did you know he's Denzel Washington's son? Sometimes he even sounds like his dad in this movie.
I think James Pattinson is a very good actor and was overlooked for his outstanding performance in The Lighthouse. You can see my review of that film here. Christopher Nolan offered him the role because he was impressed with Pattinson's performance in Good Time. He refuses to use his own London accent and says he would feel like a fraud of an actor to speak like himself. He also said that the secrecy surrounding this project was so strict that he and co-star John David Washington were only allowed to read the script in a locked room at the actual Warner Brothers studios. Even worse, actor Michael Caine was only allowed to read the pages of the script that had his lines on them. He had absolutely no idea what the movie was about until its release!
Be impressed with the effects because no green screens were used. To make the inversion scenes, director Christopher Nolan shot each scene twice: forward and backward. Yes, that means that the cast how to learn how to speak backward! Kenneth Branagh had to learn how to speak Russian backward! But wait, those stunts also had to be performed backward!
Speaking of Kenneth Branagh, he was excellent.
Be equally impressed with the soundtrack because it was pieced together online from the individual recordings of the musicians in their homes after the Coronavirus prevented them from practicing or performing together. This is actually the first Christopher Nolan movie NOT to be scored by Hans Zimmer. Zimmer wasn't available to do this film, so he suggested his friend Ludwig Goransson.
In order to get that unique sound from the villain, composer Ludwig Goransson recorded and tweaked Christopher Nolan's own breathing.
I loved seeing the car chase scenes filmed in Estonia. I visited the beautiful city of Tallinn. They used the Kumu Art Museum in Tallinn as the fictional Oslo Freeport. The opera house scene was also shot in Tallinn at a venue that was falling apart so much that the crew had to practically rebuild it.
Elizabeth Debicki was outstanding. The first time I ever saw her was in Guardians of the Galaxy (Theatrical) where she looked like a real goddess. Christopher Nolan offered her the role without auditioning but she insisted on auditioning to show herself she could do it.
That catamaran scene was crazy. It's an F50 foiling catamaran, the fastest racing class in history, reaching speeds over 50 knots (more than 60 miles per hour.)
I love that the title of the movie is a palindrome: TENET, which is perfect for a movie that illustrates things going forward and backward. The word ""TENET"" actually originated from the Sator Square, a puzzle that spells 5 words in every direction when rotated: Tenet, Sator, Arepo, Opera, and Rotas. All of those words appear in the movie as people's names or locations.
I love it when a director uses carefully thought-out details. For example, in this film, the color red is used to indicate time going forward. Blue is used to show the time inversion. The color motif is actually based on the Doppler effect. The musical score also changes to indicate the inverted time. But wait...there's more. In the final battle scene, the red team and blue team both have ten minutes to complete their missions. That's TEN forwards and TEN backward. Wow. Did your head just explode?
Non-stop action and pacing.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
I remember the first time I saw the trailer about a year ago. I had no idea what the movie was going to be about. Some viewers will still be very confused and wonder what the heck they just saw.
Christopher Nolan went to great lengths to film scenes in IMAX, so it's a shame that so few people will actually be able to see the movie in IMAX in a theater.
Sometimes it's hard to hear what people are saying, which makes it even more difficult to understand what's happening. Watch this film with subtitles if you can!
The soundtrack was often overbearing with the potential to give you a headache by the end of the movie.INTERESTING LINES:""We're trying to prevent World War 3."" - Barbara (Clemence Poesy) ""Nuclear Holocaust?"" - The Protagonist (John David Washington) ""No, something worse."" - Barbara
""But what does your heart tell you?"" - The Protagonist
""We live in a twilight world."" - The Protagonist (John David Washington)"
2546,"My Tenet review
Cons: 1-the score was REALLY loud at times which is normal for a Christopher Nolan movie but still.
2-The dialogue was hard to hear. Often times the characters were wearing oxygen masks so imagine everyone speaking a little more clearer than Bane in Dark Knight Rises. Plus the loud score, I thought it was hard to hear the characters which made an already confusing movie harder to follow.
3- Confusing! It's like Inception on speed.
Pros:
1- Special effects were pretty cool, several times I would just wonder how did they film that! Something's going back in time while others in reverse is just cool to watch.
2- Original idea, I want to watch it again because I think I'll like it more the more times I watch it. It's pretty convoluted but I like the idea of the movie. That is if I can hear the characters enough to follow the movie better the 2nd time
Ultimately it's worth the watch"
2547,"Firstly, the audio mix. I thought it might just be my cinema but given the other reviews I'm clearly not alone. The mix is dreadful. The dialogue is intelligible at times. I wondered if it was a dramatic effect at first but it's clearly not. If you were at home you might be inclined to turn up the TV but don't do that, as the score is already causing my ears to bleed. Genuinely....I have no idea how this can happen.
The science fiction element is typical Nolan and is to be enjoyed. The film making is superb but I feel the sci fi is the icing on a really bland cake. The story line, science removed, is a poor James Bond. It looks like a daniel Craig James Bond also.
I love Nolan but I feel this one relied too much on its party trick"
2548,"While I usually don't like time travel movies because of the plot intricacies that inevitably run into paradoxes, this one was pretty good and held up well upon first view. The techinal aspects of it were really good, particulary the action and the effects, and the acting was, albeit not something stellar, was a more than decent one. I liked the characters, for the most part, even if they are a little sketchy, and stereotypical at times (particularly the evil russian TM). The first half and hour of the movie felt a little rush, but I don't complain, since the plot is already pretty complex for a 2 hour and a half movie, but they managed to get it right and never make it seem to long in the end. About the time travel aspect, as I said, it is well crafted, although it may have it's flaws. Overall, a pretty decent blockbuster to enjoy. Not outlandish, but solid and thoroughly enjoyable. An 8 is well deserved."
2549,"First of all, if you like sci-fi and time travel, go watch the movie. It's worth it.Now to the review:
Laws of physics (or magic) created by writers are beyond reproach no matter how crazy or how chaotic the movie is. However, such laws have to consistent and can't excuse plot holes. Now, Tenet has no blatant contradictions or plot holes. It's more like a PoA level (where time travel was pretty OK but the plot had a bootstrap paradox problem at the end). Tenet is way more chaotic so it's harder to pick apart, especially from watching in a theater. Still, the plot-line does have some weak points where the story is forced into a certain scene just so the movie can have those cool scenes (insert spoilers here). The same with characters - some of them are overrated by the story just for the sake of diversity and there don't seem to be much rationale why or how have they gotten involved with Tenet (insert spoilers here).Rating: 6.5 (rounded up)"
2550,"After a month of waiting the new Christopher Nolan extravaganza has been released in cinemas and I have to admit Nolan did not disappoint.Plot:
Armed with only one word, Tenet, and fighting for the survival of the entire world, a Protagonist journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that will unfold in something beyond real time.Cast:
Elizabeth Debicki (Kat), Robert Pattinson (Neil), John David Washington (the Protagonist), Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Sammy) and Kenneth Brenner (Andrei Sator)Good things:
The good things in the film were the main characters who really well developed as well as the fantastic action sequences and finally the mixture all of the different genres combined.The main villain is the film is also extremely threatening and menacing to follow throughout the film.Mediocre things
The most mediocre thing in the film was the lack of continuity in the film as it shows at the beginning of the film that the suicide pill didn't work and yet at the end of the film everyone is trying to stop the main villain from using the pill. This makes no sense at all in my opinion.Bad things
The bad thing in the film was the lack of motivation for the Main Villains actions and master plan.Best Point:
The best point of the film was the opening sequence as it was extremely action packed and showed the full threat level of our main villain that we'd follow throughout the film.Worst Point;
The worst point is when we learn our Main Villains master plan as it shows a complete lack of continuity in the film as it shows at the beginning of the film that the suicide pill didn't work and yet at the end of the film everyone is trying to stop the main villain from using the pill. This makes no sense at all in my opinion.Score: 9.4 / 10"
2551,"Christopher Nolan is a director who often splits viewers. He has his unique take on things and his movies are often highly complex and require the audience's full attention.
Movies like ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"" are proof that Nolan knows how to use special effects and a complex plot and make it watchable and highly interesting. They also give the impression that Nolan has a very big interest in time and time travel.
When I first heard of ""Inception"" a few years ago many people told me that it is confusing and unwatchable. Now I think it's one of the best sci-fi movies of the last decade.
Nolan is a very capable director and someone who trusts his fans to understand his motives and ideas. I am a supporter, if not a fan, but Nolan's newest film ""Tenet"" is more complex and, at times, confusing than even ""Inception"" or ""Interstellar"" might have been.
""Tenet"" deals with time and time travel in a most creative yet peculiar way that I could not possibly explain to you here for it would take too long. The gist of it is that objects are inverted. If objects can move along in time with us they can also move backward. If that sounds ominous and confusing to you, don't worry it is all explained in extreme detail in the movie.
The movie wastes no time and starts with an assault on an opera where a target must be eliminated by a Special-OPs commando. The main character, throughout the movie only known as The Protagonist, is played perfectly by John David Washington. The Protagonist tries to save the target and gets captured and tortured. He takes a cyanide capsule, like he was taught, and awakes just to find he has been promoted, kind of. The Protagonist is taken to a facility where he is introduced to the concept of inverted objects. He is shown bullets that travel back in time and is told to investigate where these bullets come from.
Along the way, he teams up with the mysterious Neil (Robert Pattinson) who has been sent to assist him and they track the weapons back to a Russian arms dealer named Andrej (Kenneth Branagh). The Protagonist decides to get close to Andrej though his wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki). Kat is being blackmailed by her abusive husband to stay with him, by threats that she will lose her son if she tried to leave.
The rest of the movie the Protagonist and his team try to figure out Andrej's motives and how to stop him.
""Tenet"" has a lot of dialogue and spends a lot of time telling us what's going on and why. This isn't necessarily a bad thing but after an hour it gets a little tedious and I wished Nolan would just let the movie speak for itself. The plot is hard to follow as it is and even all the explanation of the confusing time travel doesn't make it better.
I know this is what most Nolan fans like, those confusing twisted plots but I for one prefer a straight-lined plot that has emotional depth, thrilling action scenes, and emotional stakes. I am missing all this here.
The action sequences, as in all of Nolan's movies, are state of the art and the incredible cinematography and editing make the movie fast-paced and exciting. I would have liked to see more of that.
Hoyte van Hoytema is a regular Nolan collaborator and one of the best cinematographers in the world. His incredible wide shots and color schemes make the action sequences glow with excitement.
Luckily Nolan chose very fine actors to compensate for the confusing story.
Washington is one of the best actors around right now. He has so much depth in his performances that it is easy to root for him.
Pattinson, who I have never considered a great actor, has really shown a lot of good performances in the last few years. He is charming as Neil the mysterious but smart and capable partner of The Protagonist. He has come a long way since the Twilight movies and with his British charm, there are few bigger roles in the future that would suit well (I am thinking of a British secret agent that will need a new face soon).
I don't know how many people know Kenneth Branagh in the USA outside Hollywood but I know he is a big deal in Britain and rightly so. He is one of the most underrated actors and just when you might have forgotten about he turns up and delivers another splendid performance.
I admire the boldness and creativity Nolan put into ""Tenet"" but he got a little overenthusiastic throughout the movie.
Nevertheless, ""Tenet"" is an entertaining movie that requires your full attention but comes to a satisfactory ending. It is full of Nolan's trademarks and after you decide to just enjoy the plot and go with the whole time-traveling concept you will definitely find this movie very entertaining.
I for one will have to watch the movie a few more times to properly understand it but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it."
2552,"Is this a great film? Yes. The pace is far superior to anything else by Nolan, whose films often feel half an hour too long. The score is perfect, the set pieces amazing and the acting - particularly Kenneth Brannagh, who deserves an Oscar for his performance as uncompromising Sater - is stellar.The mind-bending time-travelling twist is almost an unnecessary adjunct, the origin of which is never clearly explained. It would have been an excellent ""joint the dots and collect the missing pieces"" movie without this, but clearly creating a stand alone Bond-esque film was not Nolan's plan. His prefers to challenge his audiences with metaphysics - The Grandfather Paradox, for example.A little frustrating too, and typical of Nolan and attests why he is so popular with movie studies is the absolute requirement to see his movies at least twice to fully appreciate them, given the complexity of the narrative. Doesn't this insult the audience by leaving them feeling confused, at best, and intellectually inferior at worst?Given all this I still cannot criticise this movie. It will be watched by the majority of the world at least once and I fully intend to buy it on DVD as soon as it is released. I only wish I had a time machine to fast forward 2020!"
2553,"More often than not, I am on the edge of my seat when watching a Nolan film for the first time. His creativity in filmmaking is awe-inspiring. I absolutely loved The Dark Knight trilogy and Inception. The Prestige was great, I had minor issues with Interstellar, and I quite enjoyed Memento and Insomnia. Dunkirk was a great experience for a war film (particularly in IMAX), but as a narrative film, I would not revisit the film again. While Tenet is a great film in it's own right, it was not the second coming of Inception (a 10/10 for me) that I was hoping for after the vibe I got from the trailers. The film also did not have me on the edge of my seat.Nolan's greatest films pull you into the heart and soul of its characters. Apart from Elizabeth Debicki's character (and I suppose Branagh's), I felt the other characters were going through the motions and you did not truly know who they were or what motivated them except for their duty to ""prevent World War 3"". Perhaps given that this is a spy film, the lack of knowledge about certain characters is part of their schtick.The concept of 'time inversion' employed in Tenet was great, and the set pieces of forward-time individuals battling reverse-time individuals were a real treat considering what Nolan accomplished using practical effects. On the other hand, if you're well versed in time travel stories, you may find that Tenet is predictable at times as the same clichés pop up. In that regard, I felt the stakes did not feel as high or as intense (compared to the finales of TDK trilogy, Inception, Interstellar, and The Prestige), particularly when they add the concept of antimatter annihilation and don't fully explore its potential.I found the film mostly easy to follow, as the background music or sound effects are VERY loud at times, making key dialogue difficult to understand. I had to look up plot points online afterwards only because I could not fully hear what was being discussed. You would think they would have handled dialogue better after the tweaking they did with Bane or in Dunkirk.Overall, the cast and Nolan did a great job. The concept of time inversion was cool and I was not left with burning questions at the end as I was with Inception or Interstellar. For me, this film is at most an 8/10, but it deserves to be seen."
2554,"If you can understand what happens and more importantly when/in what order on first viewing you're a genius. I will definitely see it a 2nd and maybe 3rd time very soon because I lost track of the film halfway through and never caught up. I still enjoyed the visual and audio treat and top quality good looking actors on show. I agree that it was hard to hear some dialogue, maybe that was intentional as normal life is hectic/noisy let alone when you're a spy in the middle of explosions, wearing a mask... etc. Having seen it a 2nd time I think it could've benefited from work on the sound, struggled to hear some bits. The film also clunks to a halt on several occasions and jumps characters to new places with minimal explanation. Still a very good watch, my expectations were very high."
2555,"I saw tenet on Thursday then on Sunday, once in IMAX and the other one not but it was still bigger than the regular ones. This movie is brilliant. I believe Nolan makes his movies hard so we can see it and enjoyed twice. The Plot, the cast, the soundtrack and the directing was a stuff of Legends. I loved that movie and believe the second time is much better and enjoyable than the first one. The first one you will be distracted whether from the Pace of the movie or eating or drinking or side talking which I don't recommend doing. In the second time I noticed things and understood the movie much more and when I did, I enjoyed it even more. DJW was brilliant as the Protagonist and we are blessed to have DW Son as he will be talented as the old man. Robert Pattinson for me stole the show in every scene. I was against and furious when he was casted as Batman but after this movie, I am impressed and can't wait to see him as Batman ""specially after we saw the trailer"". Nolan for me is my favorite director of all time and I love the fact he wants us to keep thinking and guessing but more than that he wants us to enjoy. In the movie there was a line which I think was addressed to the audience ""Try not to understand it, try to feel it"". He wants us to feel and enjoy the movie. I wanna take that platform to say that I was deeply hurt/upset more than I thought I would about Chadwick's death our King T'challa and I just wanted to say so. Rest In Power King and Thank You for being part of our lives."
2556,"Being a Huge Nolan fan I loved the action and all the visual effects and cinematography of the movie and the imax 70 mm scenes. There are technical issues including sound mixing to the point where the Score overpowers the movie dialogue. I love Ludwig's work but Nolan I feel pushed the envelope a little too much that it becomes a drawback to the movie experience. Beyond that the plot was not as strong and felt the character development was not that great. Kenneth Branagh did a good job but was too one dimensional as a villain with a weak plot. Was sad to see as villains in other movie like Thanos were given a great backstory. Overall, it's still a great movie to watch with all the action and would still recommend the impressive 70 mm imax version."
2557,"So let's get something clear. If you are not one of those that goes back to the cinemas to watch 2 or 3 times the same movie, this one will be really difficult to follow. The movie itself is good but it has many questions that don't get answered, the plot is confusing and the sudden changes on the location and situation make it really difficult to follow.
Overall a good movie, amazing effects, rather confusing plot and that needs at least 2 views to understand it."
2558,I am going to push this from a 6 up to a 7 based on the concept. But the delivery of that concept was a let down. The story was muddled and therefore the movie came down to a number of action set pieces. In the end it was only a notch above a roland emmerich film. That is a far cry from Nolans usual offerings which offer a great combo of clever and action. The sound mixing was also horrible making the dialog difficult to hear. Yes i am deducting points for sound editing. It may be worth seeing but Nolan has done so much better that this can be one of his that can be skipped by all but die hard fans.
2559,I'll keep it short as other reviews cover this in much more detail. This film although the premise is actually quite simple is very very confusing and difficult to follow. The characters are under written and the acting can feel corny at times. HOWEVER the film is so much fun to watch and the visuals of inversion are incredible. Despite the cons of this film I would recommend to everyone and I would love to watch it again!
2560,"Did you love inception?
Were you as in awe as you were confused the first time you saw Pulp Fiction?
Then this is the film for you! Beautifully shot, gripping my storyline combine with amazing live action sequences that will keep you confusingly on the edge of your seat. It's more Jason Bourne that James Bond but a homage to both, playing with the standard clichés but in a modern and refreshing way. The soundtrack was good but I am a big Zimmer fanboy so kept thinking did it grab me like Dunkirk? Not sure that it did.
Either way 100% worthy of your concentration."
2561,For me its like simple story but epic screenplay which amaze...
2562,"Director Christopher Nolan brings yet another brain-aching story to the cinema, as he did previously with Inception (which I see I scored 75% here). This time the plot concerns our hero, a CIA agent who refers to himself as ""The Protagonist"" (played by African American John David Washington), who must the save the world from destruction. The high-concept of the film, without going into too much detail, deals with what physicists call ""The arrow of time"". Not being a scientist myself, as far as I understand it, these scientists believe that there is no reason in physics why time must travel from the past to the future. In the world of The Protagonist, there is no more arrow of time. Here, the future and the past and the present can, and will, collide. The fate of the world is at stake. I hadn't realised that I scored Inception so well and I thought that I got more out of this film. I think it's a 70% kind of movie but I'm bumping up my score by 5+% to reward Nolan for being so ambitious with his choice of subject matter, which puts the film into 8/10 star territory here on IMDB.The high-concept of the film is something that I have pondered myself and the parts of the film dealing with this are ideas that I had formed myself, namely, the notion that information can hypothetically be able to be transmitted from the future to the past (and how that would benefit people receiving that information). The film takes that one step further than I would want to, which is what makes it an interesting action film.Now, I'm not convinced that physicists would countenance the world of this film, as far as there being localised instances of this high-concept, as opposed to time's arrow just moving in one direction or the other. Perhaps the film smuggles in instances of parallel worlds or time travel and they don't really fit in or make sense when used with the core high-concept of the film. In some ways the time travel aspect is more complex than that of another film dealing with that specific idea, Primer. I've reviewed Primer here and noted how you really need a notepad and spreadsheets to keep tabs on what is happening. Or you could just ask the scriptwriter(s) to explain what the Hell is happening. In that way, Tenet is nowhere near as brain-aching and mentally taxing as Primer...but I would still question Nolan (as well as Kip Thorne) to see whether the scenarios are plausible, which I doubt that they are.A general problem with time travel stories is that I just don't believe them. I don't find them coherent. This feeling isn't dispelled by Tenet but that in no way detracted from my experience of it. If you don't think too much about the high-concept high jinks, there's pleasure to be had watching all the action unfold. Not finding these kinds of stories coherent, I wouldn't be the kind of person who would watch the film again believing that it will all make sense on a second viewing. Personally, this isn't the kind of film that would make me want to see it again just because I found it entertaining. For that reason, I wouldn't see it again just for the sake of a faint hope that everything will make sense on another viewing of it.One way in which a repeat viewing might help to make sense of things better though is that although the film is helpful with regard to the frenetic action of the finale by colour coding combatants, my problem was that I forgot what the two colours used signified! It's for these less than high-concept reasons that I can see value in seeing the film again. But I won't.To be relevant in an opaque way, whilst pondering the significance of the film's title, it occurred to me that it was a palindrome. That's kind of a primer for the film. You get little teases for the high-concept in action but Nolan does make you wait a while before throwing it at you in Hollywood action set pieces, which would be the calling card for it.This brings me to a criticism of the film: at times, people just struck me as being idiots, in the way that characters in Ridley Scott's sequels to Alien struck me as being stupid (I've said that in my reviews of those films here). There were two instances of this that I noticed: firstly, the people in a security vehicle in a heist sequence (and let's not forget the police who appear in a car later in that sequence) and, secondly, a set piece where there is a fight between a man in a gas mask in a corridor and The Protagonist. When this sequence was revisited, I was wondering why on Earth the man in the mask would try to shoot The Protagonist. It's Ridley Scott level stupidity.Another criticism of the film is more practical: at times I found it hard to understand the dialogue for various reasons. Things like people speaking with thick accents, people speaking whilst wearing gas masks or just being off-centre as far as microphone placement goes, I suppose. I didn't quite catch what the Indian woman said right at the end of the film. What was that last thing that she said? Maybe nothing too great is lost by not hearing it. But it would have been nice to have heard it clearly in any case.I can't help thinking that in current times, with what's happening or has happened in America (the #MeToo movement and the police murdering African American civilians), that audiences may resonate with an African American action hero and a key woman in the story. It should be noted that that there is no romance to be found here.Lastly, I thought Daniel Radcliffe was in this film. Wrong! It's another former teen franchise idol.Oh, I forgot to mention, maybe this film is a bit like the video game ""Braid""? I never finished that...it got too brain-aching for me!Sci-fi recommendations:Source code (10/10)12 monkeysThe thirteenth floorDark City (10/10)Gattaca (10/10)"
2563,What Nolan wrote a james bond script ? Tenet is the answer.
2564,"I was excited to see this movie in the theatre. It was the first time my wife and I went to the movies in 5 months due to Covid. So, was it worth the trip? Generally, no. I normally enjoy Christopher Nolan movies but this film is not close to Interstellar, The Prestige or The Dark Knight.It's a clever movie, but so clever it becomes confusing. I found Pattinson and Branagh to be very good in their roles. I found Washington boring and monotone. The cinematography and effects were top notch which was nice to see on the big screen. Most of the cool action has been shown in the trailer though.Save this movie for streaming because the cinematography alone is not worth the trip to the theatre."
2565,"A potentially great film that is hard to understand, but this is one of its perks. Some will watch and simply let the spectacle engulf them in an enjoyable way and others will try to tie together the clues and puzzles to understand and unlock what this film is really showing you.
Tenet is certainly worth the watch. In some ways, although we had no idea what to expect, it is exactly what you would expect from a Christopher Nolan film.
This palindromic, intelligent, enigma is one not to miss on the big screen!"
2566,"I bet Robert Pattinson smells his own lip cheese with that weird nose he's got. It literally points straight downward as if he was run over by a truck.Another Nolan ""masterpiece"" that takes a brain to think differently then every other person that walks out of the theater thinking ""like omg the best movie ever made."""
2567,Wow. I am genuinely speechless. His best film yet. I cannot wait to rewatch it
2568,"The best word to describe this film is ""disappointing"". This production had so much going for it, and certain aspects of the film work, but as a whole it falls short.On the positive side, ""Tenet"" includes some of the most beautiful scenery I have ever seen in a film. And the concept of the film is adventurous, perhaps too adventurous.Conversely, the entire film is haunted by badly flawed sound editing. I don't know how it could be unintentional, but much of the dialogue is annoyingly difficult to hear. It is muffled or obliterated by a soundtrack that doesn't augment, it competes. And much of the background music sounds less like music than a nearly atonal wall of sound, like a ubiquitous droning. The balance between dialogue and other ambient sounds is also problematic.As for the acting, Kenneth Branagh is very effective as the villainous Andrei Sator. Elizabeth Debicki is convincing as the beautiful wife of Sator, who becomes a central part of the film's intrigue. But John David Washington plays his lead role as ""The Protagonist"" emotionally flat. Bond is reserved, Bourne is stone cold, but The Protagonist shows no more feelings than a robot, despite the fact that he makes existential decisions in the story based on emotions.Still, I am glad I saw the film, if only for its ambitious stunt work and visual editing.The meaning of the tile is crypic, by I suspect ""Tenet""---a palindrome--- was used because it sounds basically the same spoken forward or backward.The time travel aspects of the film have plot holes, but not so many that I could not suspend disbelief. It's just that darn audio problem that drags this film down. And to a lesser extent, some scenes that were confusing because it was difficult to tell characters apart."
2569,From start to finish its intense! Bringing this type of concept to the big screen can only be done by Chris Nolen. One of my favourite movies!
2570,"Perhaps Nolan's most brain-dead film to date. The first half is like a familiar spy action movie, while the second half is completely immersed in another kind of feeling never seen before. As many of you probably already know, this is a movie about time and space reversal, not the familiar time travel of the past. So, basically, it involves two dimensions and perspectives of the story, one is normal space-time, and one is the opposite of the reverse space-time."
2571,"Superb movie... excellent job by all actors, all cast and storyline very good"
2572,"I find it really confusing, because I have a hard time understanding the very different world it portrays. I'll watch it one more time because I know I missed a lot of key plot points."
2573,"You need to watch It twice though. After the first time read some explanatory links and then go back to the cinema, to enjoy it even more."
2574,"Washington is hired to stop nasty Russian Branagh bring the World to an end which he can achieve with the help of his ability to bend time.There is a good amount to enjoy here although sometimes the time twisting gets rather complex and you need to wait quite a long time into proceedings before there is much clarity. This is Nolan's latest train set which he seems to have created for himself and has invited us to come along and enjoy, provided we can keep up - and sometimes this is a bit challenging. The cast are pretty good particularly Debicki and Pattinson and Branagh makes a great Bond villain which is actually what much of the film is like. Goodish fun then, but not Nolan's best bit of storytelling."
2575,"The best film ever 🖤
If u can
Go and watch this movie..
The best director in history ..🖤"
2576,"What a ride! If I were to choose one word that describes the entirety of movie it would be: EXCELLENT. The tempo was masterful, really enjoyed John David Washington's acting that synergized elegantly with Robert Pattinson's.I dare to say I understood the most of it, did watch it with subtitles though and would recommend anyone considering seeing it to do the same. I did not feel that the movie was convoluted in any way. That car chase was one of the most thrilling scenes in years! Lots of details for the observant viewer that makes sense.Overall: Definitely worth seeing in the Cinema for the full experience, the music were great and fit perfectly well - Ludwig Göransson is our generation Hans Zimmer. There even was a time or two that I got goosebumps. Best movie of 2020 this far as of September. Really enjoyed the different take on the genre and a refreshing view on the time travel concept. Go see it!"
2577,"Absolutely mesmerising. Christopher Nolan has outdone himself again. Remember watching Inception for the first time and feeling mesmerized by it but this is something else. I mean how do you even begin to sit down are write something like this.First half of the movie is like a great espionage thriller with a few hints of whats to come.
The second half of the movie was like, like, like????? I have no words to describe the second half. Just go watch it and you'll understand.Oscar season is gonna be a good one for everyone involved. The actions, special effects, score, plot and acting were all outstanding."
2578,"Nolan did it again...
Definitely one of the best nolan movies."
2579,"I am a Chris Nolan fan and have watched (and loved) every single one of his films so far. On the first viewing of Tenet, I was so confused after the car chase scene that I basically couldn't follow anything, eg who is moving forward/backward in time.However, on second viewing (and with the help of Google of course), all becomes clear, and it's a masterpiece. No idea how he managed to craft a story like this, but the whole construct is mindblowing.Many critics said it lacks human connection, emotion or character development etc. They completely, utterly missed the point. It's like complaining a Bach prelude and fugue doesn't come with music video. You don't need that, and people will listen to that same stern, austere, dry and meticulous piece of music again and again, because it is art."
2580,"When interstellar plus inceptions meets the cousin of memento. Thats all you are geeting.As they said, dont try to understand the movie, feel it! That's true. Definitely will be watching it again because i got the gist of it but if you ask me the sequence of how things happened...I have no clue. Just came back from watching the movie. Its a must theater watch movie!"
2581,"Cool idea, amazing action scenes, horrible dialogues and the worst soundtrack in a Nolan movie.
Nolan confirms himself as a great director an ok story writer and a horrible screenplay writer."
2582,Score and action were fantastic and worth the time and money but also a disappointment from Nolan
2583,I'm a science Greek so I Love it! Saw it thrice in 3 days! I hope there would be a sequel. People who rate it low just don't understand the story.
2584,"The main elements of a great movie are: script, character development, acting, timing, visual and sound are all great. Trademark Chris Nolan movie-where he puts science and storytelling together in order to produce a unique setting and host interesting complex characters."
2585,"The best movie in 2020!
All parts of the film were based on principles, I think this director came from the future!"
2586,"Watch it and you know!
about its quality
no doubt
totally waste of time
What more you want? thinking to watch it?
its a BIG NO!
poor storyline, what?
can i say its nolan's
it is a dump thought
finally to know that this movie turns out crap
fits together with splendid twist
all the storyline
then you'll see
when the real deal kicks off
it literally takes a while
and feel bored
i will never re-watch it
for this movie
you will need your mind
to do anything else
go sit back and relax
avoid this
this is what i think.

2587,"DONT WATCH IF UR DUMB
also don't watch if ur the type that doesn't always pay attention to the movies ur watching. This is a long complicated movie. The story is incredible and the twists at the end were mind blowing. Only gave 8/10 because of how smart of a movie it was. If it was a lil dumber that most people would u sweat and 10/10. My wife could barely follow n had questions at the end. Great movie. Easily an hr series on a premium network."
2588,"You cannot deny that this film is original and creative. Perhaps perplexing, but that's okay. In a time of remakes and reboots, rehashing of old films seems to be the trend. Why are we so bent on bringing this film down? Sure it requires multiple viewings with subtitles and I was initially disappointed. Then I was intrigued and then spent hours analyzing the events that took place within the story. Simply looking at the fight scenes themselves, where you have one figure performing movements in forward time and another performing movements in backward time is incredibly complex, and this was in no doubt accounted for by the filmmakers. To go a bit deeper, if you accept the internal logic then you have a lot of fun with it. In freeport scene if you have two people fighting, one would assume that if a strike is thrown and it lands, the person on the receiving end of the strike should anticipate the move if it leaves enough of a mark, bruise or cut, and those that are not anticipated (or foreseen) are the ones that land, because both parties already have the marks and bruises before they even engage in that exchange. We see this with Washington's character during the 2nd retelling of the freeport scene because the knife wound become more acute as he draws nearer to the event. And there you have a beautiful dance of a forward/backward exchange. Of course you can't anticipate every move and so to the viewer, that fight may not always makes sense because it would require you to know exactly what each party is thinking, what their moves may be, how they will react and what their overall approach would be, hence a small bit of the appreciation would have to come from the shear spectacle of it rather than trying to figure out how the fight makes sense to you. BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, IT'S REWARDING and exciting, but it's difficult to do that when we have our own busy lives to worry about. This movie is great, I'll probably watch a few more times. Kudos for creativity and originality, please continue this trend!"
2589,"After soo much and long time one can see a proper CHRISTOPHER NOLAN masterpiece
Isn't it great the way he plays with time with soo ease and his direction and stories.... No one can do this except him only
This movie is just mind blowing for those people with high IQ because fools takes 2-3 watches to understand that this is a masterpiece
If you find this movie boring than you need a brain man... It's masterpiece"
2590,"Tenet is fast paced movie, with complex concepts that viewer might not get in the first viewing.It is that kind of a movie which will age like a good wine, and be recognized as a masterpiece as more watchers watch it and there is more outside explaining that gets done {either that, or watch this movie twice :-) }The loud music is the only thing I didn't like about the movie.I really liked the build up of the movie, as a concept is slowly laid out on you, and then suddenly viewer is thrown into the real life-living of that concept, trying to comprehend what is happening and linking it back to the movie pieces we saw sometime back.There is no dull moment in the film, and the non value add moments in the film start becoming important as the film progresses.I appreciate the dense content and the courage shown by the director to use a unique fiction concept and create a visually stunning experience for his viewers.
The story is unraveling as you watch the movie, and move with the main protagonist on his journey. You will feel as surprised, or shocked as the characters felt in the movie. Even before the fictional concept has settled in our minds, the movie is pacing ahead to prevent a world ending threat using the application of the same concept."
2591,"It'd come out like this, Sadly we can't force it back up there.... or can we?This is one a few of the stupid thoughts this film filled my head with. And I still feel less stupid than this film."
2592,"It's hard to beat Inception, but it almost does. Another great Christopher Nolan movie."
2593,Look at the movie if you are ready with your mind.
2594,"As time passes, everything changes it's pace. Movies and stories from 100 years ago seem so boring and lengthy today. And just like that, movies and stories of today will seem boring and lengthy tomorrow. But Sir Nolan has written a story that is for the fast paced world of the future. A plot for intellectuals to discuss and draw inspirations from in the coming centuries. This is a true masterpiece. But yes, in order to understand this film, you need to have some basic understanding of the Temporal Dimension, Thermodynamics, Cosmology, & War Strategies(Pincer movement). So don't take those 6 star ratings too seriously, they didn't understand the whole thing. It's not a linear story. It's too complicated to get it in the first watching.Just be prepared to lose your mind and spend the next 2-3 years pondering about how the F did they write that story and shoot those scenes. Until the next Nolan film comes. Because we live in a twilight world, and there are no friends at dusk."
2595,"It will be very hard for a viewer to gather all the information provided by this movie at the first or even second watch. The question is why does a film need multiple watches? A movie has to be entertainment, not a puzzle. It must be able to explain itself in 2h 30m. On paper, Tenet should have been as good as Interstellar and Inception, but Christopher Nolan only has a great scientific idea for this movie. It does not have a story, we do not understand characters and dialogues are too shallow. For a Nolan film, I expected far better."
2596,"Tenet is a biggest masterpiece movie of 2020 and it should be seen in the theater itself because the story of this film is very well written and its screenplay is very confusing but will not get bored while watching this film and the action sequence of the film is very amazing. While watching them, even the eyes were not blinking and the most dangerous scene of the film was the Aeroplane Crash. Everyone's acting performance in the film is very good and the friendship of John David Washington and Robert Pattinson was very good. But the real hero of the film is Christopher Nolan Sir, I do not know how hard he must have shot the action scenes to make this film. VFX has not been used much in the film, all the stunts have been shot in real. The praise of this film is less."
2597,"Imagine rating this movie below 9, another brilliant movie made by one of the greatest director,this movie follows something which we have never seen before the concept the laws of the physics yet it never leaves any loopholes.it would be a disrespectful for me to rate this below 10."
2598,Another great one from Christopher Nolan. Been excited from the day this movie got announced and finally got to watch and I must say this movie is an extraordinary masterpiece. Story basically centers around time and time inversions all crafted around theoretical Physics thus making it a unique experience. No spoilers here but the whole idea of forward and backwards fighting scenes and interactions make the jaw drop and you will will have lots of rewinding moments. I highly recommend watching this movie more than once with subtitles on and you will appreciate it more when you get the whole concept and plot of the movie. I really enjoyed it and tops my favourite list of movies this year. 👍🏾
2599,"First things first. if you are deciding to watch this movie or not then here's a quick overview.*You should watch this movie if/when*
1) You love the close to reality depiction physics/ science in movies.
2) You are looking for something more than just laid back entertainment.
3) You have time and patience to rewind watch certain scenes multiple times.
4) You are saturated with time traveling movies and looking for something refreshing in the genre.
5) You are willing to watch it again if you don't get it the first time (most likely you won't unless you have an IQ of 180)* Don't watch this movie if/when*
1) You are looking for some laid back entertainment without using your head too much.
2) have watched limited movies in the sci-fi genre. (particularly time travel)
That being said, here's what I, a physics student thinks of this.* Beyond this point, there might be spoilers, so you have been warned*Without a doubt, this movie is thought provoking. And the thing that blows my mind is I tried so hard to find some legit flaws to the science of movie but failed. The action of this movie is marvelous. Hats-off to the makers for pulling it off.BUTthis movie is not for everyone. See, it really gives me immense pleasure that sci-fi is giving real life insights to physics phenomenon, but at the end of the, a movie is supposed to be entertaining. For example, 2001: A Space Odyssey is the most thought provoking sci-fi movie I have ever seen, but, it was boring. How entertaining a movie is the biggest factor to its success and how the audience receives it.Sure this movie has given insight to a different form of time travel by violating the most fundamental law of thermodynamics, but it was confusing af (I am gonna have to rewatch it)."
2600,"Waited long to watch this movie on big screen, enjoyed the BGM, locations, and screen play once you come out of theatre after watching 1st tym, u want to watch it again and again."
2601,I think this movie is best for the audience to experience the theatre after that long covid break because this movie provides the experience which is only reserved the theatres.
2602,"Those who are giving it less than a 10 or maybe a 9 are dumb wits...i mean man nolan deserves 10 just for the concept..no one has ever approached time travel like this...i mean u have to be really ignorant if u dont like this..apart from the story and the level of genius,the background music is so freaking good..editing is crisp..if u dont feel like standing up and clapping after the movie end then i think in my opinion u should approach cinema in a diffrent way...and yes one more thing please watch it in a theatre..."
2603,"Those giving Negative Reviews, they just couldn't understand the movie. Give it another try, hope you'll understand it after that. And Try to watch it in theater, the BGM and sound effects and visuals.. everything is top notch.
It's 2nd Best of Nolan, for me."
2604,"Kudos to Nolan for even attempting something like this. There is no movie quite like this. You can consider it a cross between primer and memento but this movie largely does it's own thing.The negative aspect of the movie is the pacing. Unlike other Nolan movies this one will feel very fast. There is barely an explanation of anything and things start happening fast. This can be disorienting and difficult to understand on first watch.This is actually intended that way because this movie gets better and better on further viewings. The whole thing will ultimately feel like a recursion.The dialogs are short and witty unlike previous Nolan movies. The acting of protagonist and Niel is brilliant. Action is amazing as always as is the attention to detail.In a world with the mindless superhero movies doing so well, Nolan's movies stands apart. I doubt if anyone will ever try something like this once he is not there anymore."
2605,"Hanzimmer would have done it better.. We know form interstellar, batman trilogy, inception and all... Hanzimmer is the goddam man in the world"
2606,"First the movie will confuse you, you will not understand what's happening and subtitles are a must specially if your native language isn't English. Then the elements will stay with you as everything seems to connect and if you can understand you will truly realise what a masterpiece this movie is"
2607,No once can beat this you can get without having seen it twice
2608,"Nolan, we say if you watch and understand Nolan's movies on first watch then you're as qualified as PHD in math and science.😉😜
TENET is just like his other movies hard to understand on first watch or without subtitle.
At this point how far I understand, this movie is future dystopian.
In future, our future generation trying to inversing their world of their time into our time because they lost their resources in future because of our environmental damaging. And the villian SATOR from our time helping future's people because he's dying,
So NEIL (Robert Pattinson) and PROTAGONIST (Washington) as heroes using same time inversing machines trying to stop by inversing themselves sometimes.
As many people don't understand climax of movie ( a secret actually, fully I still don't understand😉)
But yeah something understandable like NEIL has to go always in past to do same things he done for saving world that is why at last NEIL says to Washington (the protagonist) I see you at beginning.
Like hell yeah it's very confusing and brilliantly directed and written movie.
Some reviewers already said that in front of this TENET INCEPTION is child's play.... 😝😜😋"
2609,"I have to say I got it the first time I saw the movie and I love unpredictable movies. The soundtrack was amazing and I was blown away as usual by Nolan's movies. If you didn't get it watch it again with a great audio system. This movie is supposed to be loud and the music is just as important as the story telling. Its not often I look up how made the music and found out it was Ludvig Göransson how made team songs on Mandalorian, Black Panther and more. He really did a masterpiece in this movie. I don't get all the hate. But its great that we don't all think alike."
2610,Wonderful movie and the coolest idea and the most beautiful difficulty in it
2611,"The Christopher Nolan brand is known for mostly two things: 1. Sci-fi action spectacles that blow your mind 2. Complex, layered storytelling with a host of characters. Does Tenet deliver on these two counts? Yes. Does it feel gratifying emotionally? Not quite.Right from the explosive start, Nolan takes us on an adrenaline-pumping ride that's filled with set-pieces you cannot see anywhere else, plenty of blink-and-miss dialogue that explains storyline intricacies, and a save-the-world plot that only gets better in the final hour. The performances in Tenet are fine; nothing too remarkable. There isn't one character (including the protagonist, played by John David Washington) that gets fully developed or delivers with wholesome intent. Robert Pattinson slips into the suave side-kick role with ease while Kenneth Branagh's Russian baddie (with a fake accent) feels like one of those lesser Bond-film villains. Elizabeth Debicki, the wonderful performer that she is, gets a character that's more like a plot-forwarding device. Dimple Kapadia impresses in the little screen-time allotted to her.In fact, all that character development probably happens in the film's timeline future that we don't get to see. Similar to his other sci-fi flicks, Nolan introduces concepts within his storytelling realm that further explain a character's decisions or actions (in this case, it's ""inversion""). Even though there were quite a few compellingly crafted set-pieces, it wasn't until the 90-minute mark or so that I felt fully invested in the story or the characters' destinies. Nonetheless, this has got to be one of his weaker scripts, with the concept and craft overwhelming the character sketches.By all means, Tenet warrants a viewing on the big screen (preferably in IMAX) to embrace the visual impact in all its glory (Hoyte van Hoytema is the one capturing it all on camera!). Ludwig Göransson's score, a blend of rapid percussion and rhythms, is one that imparts a sense of urgency to the proceedings. Though, at times, it drowns out bits of dialogue (especially if you aren't watching a subtitled version). Tenet would have certainly been a tough film to edit, given its complex visual structure, multi-dimensional plot, and detailed set-pieces. Jennifer Lame did a pretty good job at it, especially in the film's racier second half.While it's going to take a long time for another Nolan film to hit the screens, I'll rewatch Tenet but at a later point when I'd feel like studying its nuances in greater detail."
2612,Tenet is just awesome. I'll admit i didn't understand the movie(but that's just because i am slow). But still you can see the beauty of this film. Easily one of the best movies till date!
2613,"Movie is quite good. Worth seeing. But the main idea makes no sense.Lets analyse first and simplest event: bullet in the opera. Main character saw the hole before it was reversed. Would he see it day before? Yes, because it was caused by bullet travelling back in time. Would he see it year before? Ten years? Would he see it when this opera was built? Yes, yes, yes. So they build the opera with a hole and a bullet inside? That's the only explanation to this event. But that makes no sense."
2614,Starts with complex idea....which is hard to follow.after first half of the film you can finally grasp whats happening. This masterpiece deserves a sequel. But we know thats npt gonna happen.
2615,"When Nolan release a movie you know that Time/space will be tweaked, well it's the case for Tenet, without doubt this is not the finest Nolan movie but I still like it and enjoyed most part of it, the director is always looking for something original with some new ideas something we really lack in today cinema only for that i liked this too complicated piece, yes it's hard to follow and understand.... and for sure this is not a popcorn movie.... this is a concentration of Nolan styles, less emotional more clinical! At the end i hope you watch it more than once, a second vision is so important to appreciate TENET! This piece was exclusively made by NOLAN for his biggest Fans!"
2616,"Christopher Nolan continues to envision new ways of telling a thrilling story using the subject of Time. From the nonlinear back and forth of Memento, to the continuous ticking of Dunkirk, Nolan has mastered keeping his audiences at the edge of their seats while they unraveled the new concept of how he wants to define Time, and Tenet is the same. Tenet is an action-packed, sophisticated heist movie, with an idea that will leave you scratching your head only to give up in confusion. But, once again, leaving the theater thanking Nolan for his brilliants.Tenet falls short in areas like shallow and cliche characters and the head-scratching concept of Inversion that made the audience work too hard without the same rewards compared to movies like Inception and Memento. Instead of leaving the audience in an AHA moment with an ounce of mystery to wrap up their own endings, Tenet leaves you with more questions rather than answers and a timeline with endless possibilities. It's confusing, to say the least.What it lacks from other movies, it makes up in bringing back the full cinematic experience. A needed movie in 2020 when theaters have been closed for most of the year. Tenet is a reminder that certain movies need to be watched in theaters (and in IMAX) to fully immerse yourself in the sight and sound of what the writers, directors, cinematographers, music composers, editors, etc. envision. It's one of those movies that demand your full attention for 2h and 30min and you're lost in their world, where your reality is gone. Tenet isn't just a movie that you watch -- it's a film that you experience."
2617,"I was anxiously waiting for this movie release since longtime ago when they announced that Nolan is working on a new movie , in fact i really skeptic because in nolan's recent movies the level of confusion is getting higher with every movie : it started with PRESTIGE where the story was based on fictious idea about human cloning then in the next movie INCEPTION nolan took the confusion into new territory with all that stuff about dreams then the bar took another notch up with INTERSTELLAR which i didn't love coz the confusion was totally high and beyond anyone's ability to believe so when TENET trailer was released i feared that Nolan would take his formula of confusion to a place nobody reached, unfortunately all my fears and concerns really came true when i watched it , i spent the first 30 minutes wondering what a hell is going on? and then by time i managed somehow to cope with what happening on screen and in a way or anoother i was overwhelmed with story and plot till reached the final 20 chapter of the movie i was totally lost and unable to keep up with it.
it's really kind of movies that you have to watch more than once in order to absorb it well, that doesn't mean that it's bad movies on contrary it's very well made movie with astonishing VFX that non-CGI dependent , the only problem with it in short words that it's HARD TO BELIEVE/HARD TO UNDERSTAND."
2618,"I mean come on I love chris nolan, but this seems like a classic case of an idea that sounded amazing on paper but then it gets on the screen and it's just so much information you pay attention so hard you get a head ache and then you probably wont get it anyway."
2619,"I'm a massive Christopher Nolan fanboy.... Memento, The Dark Knight and Inception are 3 of my favourite movies of all time.Tenet however will not make it on to that list.
At times its pace is far too rushed, giving you no chance to digest the plot ideas thrown at you mid explosion, at other times its frustratingly slow, for instance focussing too intently on the dynamic of the married couple instead of explaining what the hell is going on in the world ending scenario.Even as the movie finishes you are left to fend for yourself and make up your own idea of what's gone on.. but not in a satisfying way like inception's brave and ambiguous spinning top finale.I feel like there was a truly great film in there somewhere, it has all the ingredients but it got lost along the way in the jarringly loud explosions and score, too sparse screenplay, paper thin characters and convenient/ confusing plot devices.There is a lot of talk that the only way to appreciate this movie's intricacies is to watch it at least twice, this was partially true with memento too but the difference with that film was it was still understandable and incredibly rewarding on its first watch, in my view Tenet just isn't, I see it as a flaw if a story can't be thoroughly enjoyed on any level without repeat viewings or by trawling the internet afterwards for fan theories and explanation threads. I love a film that makes you think but it has to give you something intelligible back and it's themes should at least be consistent.Such a shame as I was really looking forward to watching it and was pretty convinced I'd absolutely love it.
Instead it's a 7/10 for me for the admirable original concept, cinematography, acting and the (failed) mental workout. Could've been so much better though and doesn't come close to hitting the giddy heights of inception."
2620,"Nolan, my dude, you need a break. Not only from movies, but from life in general. You may need to calm down a little bit.Now, seriously, what is the problem with this guy? Why, in every movie he makes nowadays, there is always this necessity for making super, super serious characters, always looking super, super intense and talking like soulless machines? I guess that, since the Dark Knight (and I like that movie btw) that is his trademark, but the guy is not Tarkovsky, as much as he would love to be. He always thinks he's making super artsy, cerebral, sophisticated movies and, following that train of thought, his characters are always trying to talk ""deep"" stuff, spewing exposition like there is no tomorrow. You know, something Nolan is known for.I still like Interstellar, Inception, the Dark Knight, and even Dunkirk. My favorites of him are Memento, the Dark Knight and Inception. My least favorites are the Dark Knight Rises and this one.So, you thought his movies are over-expositive? Man, this one makes the rest of them look like 2001 A Space Odyssey in comparison. This movie has one of the worst expositition incontinence I've ever seen in a movie. Always talking talking talking talking, and always trying so fricking hard to explain the plot. There is a sequence in which Michael Caine appears to explain the plot to the protagonist, and the only purpose of the sequence and the character is that, explaining the plot. Literally, it's the only appearance of Michael Caine in the movie. And guess what? The movie doesn't even bother to give him an inch of characterization, apart from being English. How insulting is that??You may think, the plot of the movie is really complicated, so that's the reason why the plot needs to be explained by the characters every minute. But no. If you think that, you've just been fooled by Nolan. At the end of the day, the plot is that there is this realy really bad antagonist, Kenneth Brannagh, and these good guys, Washington and Pattinson. Brannagh has cancer, so he just wants to die and (because he's bad and her fiancé doesn't love him I guess??) he wants to take the world with him. So, the future humanity contacts him to provide him with some technology that allows objects to inverse entropy, so in these things time runs backwards. By some convoluted plan that is explained over and over in the movie (and still it's confusing), Brannagh would be able to inverse the entire planet so, by some logic, the world would collapse and everybody would die. The future is OK with that plan since they also want to die because (and this is explained in the last 20 minutes in the movie, I swear to God) the world is literally drowning itself in climate change, so they think ""No need to keep living, we will just kill the past so that we will die too!"". This plan doesn't make any sense in a lot of ways, but the most insulting one is that they don't even know if by killing the past, the future will die, so what's the reason for this desperate suicide? Do you want me to believe that a future Earth that is capable of, basically reverse time, can't do anything about climate change but giving up and waiting for suicide?? The worst thing is, although this is really crucial to the plot, nothing is developed but instead it's explaining by Brannagh in three lines of dialogue at the end of the movie. Instead of giving a stupid explanation that don't make much sense, why the movie doesn't develop that plot point throughout the movie little by little? The reason is, they don't have time for that. They have so much exposition to talk, that unless the movie lasts for 4 hours, it's impossible for Nolan to establish the plot without verbalizing it constantly.The reversion of time. Sorry to say it, but it felt extremely gimmicky. Not only there is that, but there is time travel too. That's weird, because Nolan himself said that this movie is not about time travel. Dude, your movie is about reversion of time and time travel, are you kidding me? There is bearly anything else in your movie!! Look, I'm not saying that you can't make an action movie with time inversion, because you can. In fact, how cool could that be? But, I'm afraid that in this movie, it's really underutilized and pointless throughout the last third of the movie. Basically, in the end, there is this war of the good guys vs the bad guys, and the good guys army splits in two halves, one it is inverted, and the other half isn't. Why do they do that? They clearly establish that an inverted bullet is as dangerous as a normal bullet. Not more, not less. So, is just to confuse the enemy? Idk, it's never shown. There is actually no reason, they just have to use the inversion technology. That is why I say that it felt really gimmicky in a good chunk of the movie.If we dive into the characters, you will see what is really lacking here. Washington and Pattinson really tried to give the characters some level of personality, being Pattinson the one who really give one nice impersonation of a secondary character. Washington, on the other side, tries but his script gets on the middle of him. When he is fighting is fine, but when he's not you will see that something is missing. No personality can be shown if your only chance to shine is through reacting to expository dialogue... Being fair, Washington's character could have been developed through his relationship with Brannagh's wife, but that went almost nowhere too. And speaking of that woman... Well, she is the biggest victim of Nolan. Fully, completely. Her acting is really stiff (as Brannagh's), but pretty sure it's not her fault- it's Nolan's fault. Look at her acting and you will see I'm right. She acts serious, very serious, almost comically serious, and taking account of the directing of actors in Nolan's movies, I'm sure that those were Nolan's instructions. And her character is, like every woman in Nolan's movies (except maybe Anne Hathaway in the Dark Knight Rises), very bland. Look, I get it ok? A son is something important. But if you are a woman this doesn't mean that all your emotions are connected with your son, ok? That's a very insulting way of portraying women. She, throughout the movie, keeps saying ""My son. My son. My son. I'm nothing without my son"". Besides, she is only that. She is the object to be rescued and that's it. In fact, this movie reminded me of James Bond not a few times, with the difference that James Bond has wit, charm and some development.And folks, we are forgetting one thing. The Nolan twist and the end of the movie. Because you know, the guy needs them like air to breathe. This is, though, the least compelling of all Nolan twists. Basically Washington comes from the future and he knows Pattinson since many years ago, because he created and ran Tenet and he recruited Pattinson, being the Washington that we see in the movie the one that hasn't travelled yet, so he's oblivious of all that (since in his timeline, that hasn't happened yet). But this is completely unrelated to the plot, unnecesary and pointless, and opens a lot of contrived questions that didn't need to be asked nor answered. It looks like a twist by contract. Whatever, another Nolanism.By the way, the score of this movie sounds like someone trying to copy Inception's BSO. It's like Hans Zimmer without Zimmer being in it.Now it's time to talk about positives. It's sad, but even though I'm not the biggest fan of Nolan's style of directing and scripting, I usually like his movies. But in this movie even the acting felt uninspired, and that never happened in a Nolan movie before. If I had to point for positives, I guess the action scenes were creative, and the plot is, or could have been, really interesting. It is like a higher, sophisticated version of a James Bond movie with certain elements of sci-fi. More than that, I walked out very underwhelmed, even when I was ready to accept all the traits of a Nolan movie. 4.5/10"
2621,"When you watch the ""first half"" of the film you don't really understand what is going on and you find it hard to follow but still... the action was on point!In the ""second half"" of the film you start to notice why there was some weird stuff going on (especially when John David and Robert Pattinson are fighting the ""inverted"" fella when they have just crashed a plane). But you do get the just to what is going on... I'd probably recommend a second watch.All in all, Chris Nolan did a fantastic job with the film! I don't even know how they managed to film all the inverted stuff but it was really well made and I enjoyed it.P.S: the audio might need fixing at times 😂"
2622,"As much as I like Christopher Nolan films I found tenet to be rather very confusing at times as it was hard to hear the dialogue in the film because of the loud soundtrack, might need to revisit the film to change the opinion of this film"
2623,"Director Christopher Nolan is now well-known for his high-concept flicks, whether dealing with literal magic, the cosmos, the gritty realities of a superhero universe, or even the logic of dreamworlds. There's perhaps no one better at tackling such gargantuan undertakings. Yet, Nolan's films never come off as overly technical, as they all are grounded by incredibly nuanced characters that are just as important as the thought-pieces. Until Tenet, that is.For a very basic overview, Tenet introduces the viewer to The Protagonist (John David Washington), a man who is thrust into one could be called a temporal war for humanity. In the future, humans have learned to change the entropy of physical options or people, essentially sending them backwards through the flow of time rather than how we normally experience it. They are using this power to run covert operations with the ultimate goal of trying to permanently reverse the entropy of the world, killing millions in the process. The presumed leader of this movement is Sator (Kenneth Branagh), and the only ""in"" to get to him is wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki), who is trying to escape his entrapment of her and her son.Because Tenet has Nolan behind the camera, it almost goes without saying that it is expertly crafted/shot. A 7/10 ranking is about the lowest I could give it, as it was entertaining to me at the very least.The reason why I have it on the low end of that spectrum? There's no doubt that the reverse-entropy idea is fascinating. A different sort of time-travel from that of, say, Back To The Future. Yet, the film itself goes out of its way to constantly remind the viewer not to spend the entire runtime trying to ""figure it out"". It simply has to be rudimentarily accepted, which is okay because this is cinema after all. However, this approach requires strong characters or dilemmas to take the focus off the un-solvable mystery, and that is what Tenet sorely lacks.The evolution of Kat's character is clearly what Nolan intends to be the ""humanity"" of the picture, but it doesn't hit home as well as similar emotional climaxes from his other films. Perhaps a second viewing would/will change my mind on this point, but as it stands after my first watch I never really felt like this crucial angle connected with me like it should have.Another thing I found odd is the revelation--spoken by a character late in the proceedings--that the reason future-us wants to reverse the flow of time is because Earth become inhabitable due to global warming and thus the only way to continue living is ""backwards"". What a golden idea--yet it isn't even hinted at until the end and even then completely dropped after its utterance in favor of a different endgame focus. It really felt, to me, like that idea needed to be much bigger in this film somehow.Like I said, Tenet is still an entertaining movie to watch. I don't think Christopher Nolan is physically capable of making a ""bad"" movie. Yet, with Tenet, he has a film that tells its audience to not actively solve its central puzzle-box, but then doesn't give them enough to distract them from that very task."
2624,Technology of this movie is awesome. Fast pace with a few times to understand what just happened. Acting was subpar compared cinematic artwork. Well worth your time and money.
2625,"The spectacle of this movie is jaw dropping no arguing that.
But it does have a very multi-layered complicated story that I feel most people watching would find confusing at least on the first time around.
You get very little to no guidance to how the world you are watching works... And even when things are explained it is often not helped by the movies poor sound mixing can hardly hear what anyone is saying during some scenes.In summary is this Nolans best film?
Sadly no.But he really does try do something different with Tenet, most people will enjoy the film if not a little confused by the end..."
2626,"I just watched #Tenet and think it's safe to say that although I am as confused as everyone else who has watched it, I enjoyed it!What you should watch now? Absolutely, but more than once to help you understand what the hell is going on!!!#tenetmovie #ChristopherNolan #JohnDavidWashington"
2627,"Tenet is certainly an extremely ambitious project even for a director like Nolan, who will use any means necessary to achieve his vision. The film is supposedly shot using zero green screens, not to mention less CGI than most romcoms, and it really shows. The spectacle is absolutely off the rails this time, with some of my favourite set pieces from any film ever. There was one action sequence in particular that I won't spoil, but I even preferred it to the infamous rotating hallway sequence in Inception. However where Tenet absolutely excels in it's action and scale, it completely fails to miss the mark with its exposition. I cannot count the sheer number of times a vital piece of storytelling was explained in a quick exchange that, if you somehow didn't hear, you will most likely not understand half of the proceeding events. They even used the classic 'fish out of the water' technique, in which the character is introduced to a new world of sorts, and taken through it step by step, but somehow the audience will still somehow not feel like they're learning with the protagonist. Maybe it's just the case that the brilliantly complex narrative is simply too hard to instantly comprehend in your first viewing, but I firmly believe it could've been handled better. On the bright side, Tenet doesn't rely on deep meanings in its story (unlike interstellar which felt almost like a Terrence Malick film), but rather leans into what Nolan is good at; Weaving intrigue and intricacy into the plot, and like in all of his previous attempts it works wonders. The film has perhaps one of my favourite iterations of the time travel formula, and once you to an extent understand what's going on you feel instant satisfaction. I'm certain the film will demand several viewings to get what is happening at all times, but for now I simply don't have the intellect to tell you if it makes 100% sense. John David Washington and Robert Pattinson make a fantastic duo, and I enjoyed every minute they shared on screen, however none of the other characters really resonated with me. Kenneth Branagh is a decent villain but at times it feels like he's just forcing his lines. Elizabeth Debicki was the pretty much the only character I could sympathise with, but at times she only felt there like a damsel in distress or a plot device, and they even took the time to try and flesh out her relationship with Washington, but then decided to take it absolutely nowhere. Something I realised when I walked out the cinema, was that I could barely remember any instance where the musical score was memorable. Ludwig Görrason's soundtrack is simply quite unremarkable. It's certainly not bad, and it suits the atmosphere well, but in comparison to both Zimmer and Julyan's work in other Christopher Nolan movies it just feels lacklustre at times. To sum up, Tenet is certainly a highly enjoyable action movie, and for spectacle alone it's worth seeing on the big screen, but a mediocre script, convoluted plot and an altogether forgettable ensemble cast prevent it from being anywhere near my favourite Nolan film."
2628,"This a very fast pased action movie which also uses sci-fi elements. The events which take place in the film are in forward direction in time as well as in backwards direction in time simultaneously.I can see a lot of people comparing it with previous Nolan films about how it lacks depth when it comes to the characters and the overall message of the film, the underlying theme etc. But don't see it like that. This film is made specifically to show how the scenario would be if we perceive time in a different way. It's like a thought experiment, but on film, Don't dig too much into it (as a character says in the first half of the film, feel it.) and just enjoy the cause and effect of the events which turn into great action sequences.Instead of comparing this movie with inception, see it more like Keanu Reeves speed/ mission impossible. It's a fast pased action film with a very generic plot which is, 'save the world before the bad guy blows it.' A generic story but with a Nolan twist. This movie atleast needs 2-3 rewatches because it is presented like a puzzle, some of you might get it in the first viewing some of you wouldn't and thats fine. (In fact it's based on worlds oldest puzzle, the stator square) After watching this second time, I was really fascinated about how they came with such complex concept and actually put it in action.Again, not a perfect film but quite an experimental one. If this wasn't made by Nolan it would have been called underrated. But the fact that Nolan made it, people are now critial. So we can say Nolan is actually competing with himself by now just like what happens in the film, because the bar he set for himself is pretty high.I really wished instead of a film they should have turned this into a series, Nolan's brother already has experience with shows like Westworld. Anyway for now I'll make it work with the movie."
2629,"Vor einigen Jahren gab es Gerüchte, Christopher Nolan würde den nächsten James-Bond-Film drehen. Wie ein Spionagefilm von Nolan aussehen würde, stellt er nun in seinem neuen Film zur Schau: Hier gibt es Bond-typische Szenen, in denen der Protagonist, Protagonist, eine Reihe Handlanger ausschaltet, vom Bösewicht zum Essen eingeladen wird (die Figuren sind alle entweder die Guten oder die Bösen), dort einige Szenen im Mission-Impossible-Stil, wo präzise getimte, unmöglich erscheinende Einbrüche gemeistert werden. Das Spionagefilmgenre wird aber mit dem Zeitreisefilm, genauer gesagt Zeitreise-Actionfilm, gemischt, bei der der Bösewicht durch die Zeit reist, um die Menschheit auszulöschen, und die Helden ihm folgen, um ihn aufzuhalten. Besonderes Gimmick bei Nolan: Die Zeitreisenden, die ""Inversen"", bewegen sich rückwärts durch die Zeit.Tenet ist ein Film mit den typischen Stärken und Schwächen eines Christopher-Nolan-Films. Die Charaktere bleiben blass und werden kaum charakterisiert, die Beziehungen sind schwach, die Dialoge sind schwach, vor allem, wenn sie allzu philosophisch werden, und der Film ist kitschig, beispielsweise im Verhältnis zwischen dem Bösewicht, Sator, und seiner Frau. Hinzu kommt, dass der Film sich komplizierter macht, als er müsste, indem er viel dialogbasiert und fremdwörterschwer erzählt, sodass man im Kino mal eins, zwei Sekunden überlegen muss, was mit ""bitemporaler Zangenbewegung"" gemeint ist.Die Stärke des Films ist aber gewiss seine Originalität. Wenn Inception ""Zeitlupe - Der Film"" ist, dann ist Tenet ""Reverse motion - Der Film"". Vor allem die Szenen, in denen Reverse Motion und Forward Motion zusammen im selben Bild sind, sind spannend anzusehen. Außerdem dreht Nolan auf Film und nutzt praktische Effekte statt CGI, was spätestens dann sehr befriedigend anzusehen ist, wenn ein Jet in ein Gebäude kracht.Leider lässt der Film auch einiges an Potenzial liegen. Es wird etwa das Problem erwähnt, dass eine Person sich selbst auslöscht (oder mit den Worten des Films: ""annihiliert""), wenn sich die ""lineare"" und die ""inverse"" Version desselben Ichs berühren. Dies passiert im Film keinmal. Auch die Möglichkeit, sich im Fenster der linearen Welt wieder aus der Zeitmaschine herauskommen zu sehen, wenn man dabei ist, in die inverse Welt einzutreten, um zu sehen, ob man Erfolg haben wird bzw. überlebt, wird kaum dramaturgisch genutzt. Man könnte erwarten, eine Figur bekommt dadurch auch einmal zu sehen, nicht nur ob, sondern auch wie sie Erfolg auf der Mission hatte, wie in einer selbsterfüllenden Prophezeiung - solche sind dramaturgisch immer großartig. Und natürlich, was passiert, wenn eine Person sich nicht zurückkehren sieht - geht sie trotzdem das Risiko ein und versucht, ihr Schicksal zu besiegen?Wenn man, wie etwa in Interstellar, einen großen Twist erwartet, wird man vermutlich enttäuscht sein, denn diesmal bleibt er aus. Ab der Rückkehr der Helden als inverse Zeitreisende zum Flughafen, in den sie vorher eingebrochen sind, könnte man erwarten, dass sie von nun an gegen ihre früheren Schritte aus der Vergangenheit vorgehen, doch nichts derlei. Auch die Beeinflussung zwischen der Vorwärts- und Rückwärts-Zeitabläufe, die Nolan zuzutrauen gewesen wäre, beschränkt sich auf einige wenige Momente. Und dann geht auch noch eine Aufopferung am Ende etwas unter.Das klingt jetzt alles etwas negativ. Dennoch ist mein erster Eindruck positiv, vor allem, nachdem sein letzter Film mich enttäuscht hat. Nolan erzählt diesmal nämlich auch teilweise auf filmisch interessante Weisen. Wir haben hier die vielleicht beste Nutzung von Reverse Motion in einem Film, eine gut gefilmte Folterszene, bei der ein Zug vor der Kamera entlangfährt und uns nichts sehen und hören lässt, einen brutalen Kampf mit Küchengegenständen und hier und da Narration via Gegenstände statt Erklärdialoge. Leider limitiert Nolan sich selbst durch kitschige Nebenhandlungen, bei denen die einzige Motivation die Wiedervereinigung einer Familie ist - Inception und Interstellar lassen grüßen. Es wäre interessant, zu wissen, wie ein Nolan-Film aussähe, würde er doch bloß Menschen und Emotionen verstehen. Der beste James-Bond-Film des Jahres ist Tenet vermutlich trotzdem."
2630,"For me, TENET movie in IMAX is something like an 'amazing dream' full of events that -for the first glance - seems to be logically unconnected .. with two and a half hours that pass like if they were few minutes .. and once you wake up, you realize that you neither remember nor understand what was happening there!
But, it's still an amazing dream, and it deserves to be watched in cinema screen.Highly Recommended, But, it's too hard to understand for the first time .. So, take the advice given to the protagonist in one of the first dialogues..
""Don't try to understand it, feel it""So, watch it, feel it, and enjoy it -with an awakened mind- for the first time, after that you can try to connect the dots and deepen your understanding and experience."
2631,"Tenet is without a doubt Nolan's most challenging film. The plot is difficult to understand, most of the dialogue is incomprehensible, and how this movie handles time makes your head hurt. With that being said, this movie is visually stunning and a lot of its scenes are some of the craziest I've ever watched. I don't know how I feel about Tenet and I need to rewatch it."
2632,"First off, the fact that you're here reading this review, means you want to know if its worth investing your time in this movie. The answer to that is yes! Even if its not a 8.8 or a 9 on Imdb , it doesn't mean it's not great!I'll start with cons:
* Sound effects are really good but too loud sometimes and the mixing makes the dialog really difficult to understand and at times you won't understand a word.Thats it. The rest are not cons. We claim that we want something original but in the case of Tenet this proves that we set our expectations to things we like and want something more like that.Its not going to be like the dark knight trilogy ,prestige, interstellar or even Inception.If you're going to be in the cinema looking for someone like the joker , or looking for heist scenes like inception , or looking for strong characters like in prestige and inception. You are not going to get that! You are going to get something original.The movie was a really good and cinematic! The action and fight scenes are going to be something you've never witnessed before.I do agree at times it could be hard to follow, but that's the beauty , the more you rewatch the more you enjoy it and especially without having the regret to have not watched it initially on a big screen with good sound( or not - in this case).Overall a great movie! And definitely worth a watch."
2633,"First time watching felt like there was too much to comprehend at once.Second time viewing with subtitles was way more enjoyable. So many more clues you notice. Ludwig Göransson's score is not on the level of Hans Zimmer's for past Nolan movies but still very memorable.Whilst the film is extremely complex, I find that it's dangerous to overthink the movie and try make it make sense.The quote from Barbara at the start sums up perfectly how to watch the movie: ""Don't try to understand it. Feel it."""
2634,"Tenet is undoubtedly one of Christopher Nolan's most audacious films. If you were blown away by Inception, this will leave you in a state of cerebral apoplexy. The entire concept of time travel is re-written. No retrofitted suped up DeLorean here thank you very much. My only gripe would be that the final act of the film is a tad overwrought which left me a more than a little confused, but that could just be me. My major complaint is that the sound mix lacks focus and definition in some scenes, but beyond this Tenet is exceptional. As usual the cinematography and visual effects are on par with what you'd expect from Nolan's films. I wouldn't say it's one of his best films, but it ranks fairly high."
2635,I feel like there could have been a better story to tell than this one.
2636,This is a really good movie.the character play their roll in very good manner.
2637,Loved the spectacular things that Chris nolan produces on screen it really is a feast for your eyes.. impossible to follow and understand but it really doesn't matter with things ive never seen before on film.. just enjoy it for that and don't worry to much about the plot cos it will fry your brain to into mush
2638,"I feel like whenever somebody talks about a Christopher Nolan movie they have to mention the directing and how great it is and this movie is no exception. The directing in this movie was outstanding and I can't think of any other director who would be able to help bring this movie to life. From the epic action scenes that pretty much had zero CGI involved to the story that's mind-bending and requires a second viewing in order to fully understand what's happening and pick up on small details. There were so many shots in this movie that just had me going wow at how gorgeous they were and thinking how did they do that. I want to talk about the action scenes that sure might not be the most original but Christopher Nolan helped make them just that. While watching this I was just thinking about how they filmed so much of this with little CGI and from what I could hear not that many injuries. I wish I could watch the behind the scenes of the making for this movie because I really want to know how they filmed these scenes. There are so many movies about time travel out there but this story takes that and makes it original in a unique way. The story had me captivated from the opening scene to the very end but I will say there were times where it lost me. This movie is two and a half hours long and for the most part, you don't feel it but there are parts where I was like alright let's speed this up. This isn't helped by some awkward editing choices. For the most part, the editing in this movie is completely fine but there were some times where I was like why did we cut away just to cut right back to the same scene? It doesn't take anything away from the enjoyment of the movie at all but just me nitpicking. One thing I won't complain about though is the score in this movie, composed by Ludwig Goransson. The acting in this movie was great and you could tell that everybody was at least attempting to give it their all. For me, there was one real stand out and that was Kenneth Branagh, who plays Andrei Sator. Every time he was on screen you could just tell he was giving it his all and he made an intriguing villain. In the end, Tenet is a movie that for me at least needs to be viewed two times in order to fully grasp what's going on and it's best to keep your brain turned on while watching instead of turning it off."
2639,"So I've not long got in from watching this thoroughly confusing yet entertaining film! My immediate reaction to the credits is ""I will need to see this again"" I'd comfortably say I'll need to watch this again for a second and third time, once to absorb the story again with a vain knowledge of what's about to happen and to enjoy it once more, the Other for reading subtitles some speech is muffled when masks are used I'd like to know if I missed much where my ears failed to pick up the words.All in all a great film, plenty going on but it never fails to keep your attention. To say anymore would involve spoilers I'll leave that to someone else."
2640,"It isn't perfect, but that's ok. What it is, is the cinematic experience going to the movies should feel like. Nolan's imagination and ambition is a gift to us all."
2641,"What a movie... I definitely need to see it again to really absorb it, a very high octane movie that never slows down.iMAX experience was brilliant, a very stylish movie with minimal cgi, loads of actions and great cast and a great comeback movie with the return of cinema.Nolan movie worth a watch but will defo need to see again to put the jigsaw pieces together."
2642,"This actress is very special, and all of the actors deliver memorable if not exceptional performances. Nolan delivers another mind-twisting epic, as expected, and we are not let-down (though I'd rather he make Interstellar 2).I took two stars off for the awful sound; could they not have fixed this will its delayed release? The score is intrusive, at times, and you cannot understand half the dialogue. It will require another view with subtitles.That all said, it's a fun film full of twists, and while it's confusing, I think a second viewing will glean some insights. It's almost like two films in one."
2643,Not sure what to expect but it was excellent. Went to see with the family we all really enjoyed it. As a fan of most of the actors it was well worth watching.
2644,"Started OK ..
Then just got more and more lost .. in the plot and the objectives .
Have to really focus on the dialogues.. to grasp the idea of tenet .
Would prefer it they try to simplify the idea more ."
2645,"I was massively hyped to see this film on the big screen finally. As a spectacle, It was big, loud, incredibly bold and very impressive with its concepts and plot and although I really enjoyed the visuals, sound and acting, I did walk out very confused.This was partly due to the insane complexity of the film, but like Nolan's other films, you will notice a bit more each time you re-watch it so I don't have a problem with that. Inception and the Prestige particularly get better and better each time I re-watch them, and Tenet I'm sure will be the same.The other reason is my main negative with the film, the sound mixing. It is extremely difficult at times to understand what people are saying, either due to thick accents, characters talking from behind a gas mask or because there is a lot of background noise + the pounding score. For a film that is very aware that it is complex, the sound mixing could really do with enhancing the dialogue. Watching it with subtitles would really help.However, after several re-watches, I think this film will turn out to be yet another masterpiece from Christopher Nolan, I don't think it will turn out to be his best film, but that was always going to be very hard to achieve when he has such a strong and consistent filmography. It's plot is very clever and is truly unique and original, and in a world dominated by largely boring, disposable and generic superhero films (there are a few exceptions obviously).Tenet is a breath of fresh air to the film industry which challenges the mind with its daring plot and then blows it away with its stunning visuals. The acting is top notch all round, even if the character development is a bit light, but this film is all about the plot and the experience, which it certainly delivers on. I highly recommend it, but be warned it might initially leave you with a lot of questions, so definitely go and see it at least twice to really appreciate the masterwork that is Tenet."
2646,"TenetI am so overjoyed to see a movie in a movie theater. Probs to Warner and the entire team for bringing the film out despite everything.ABOUT THE MOVIE AND MY EXPERIENCETenet didn't break my head like Inception, because I was totally lost there. I was able to follow Tenet quite well, but as soon as the film ended my first thought was 'I have to watch the film again'. It is a brilliant idea by Christopher Nolan to address inversion. In the course of the film, I also got along well with all the laws of physics and the algorithm, which is what this was about. My concern in the film was that details would slip away or even missed. Every time I had the feeling that I understood everything it turned out that I did not really understand everything and was taught better. That is also the reason why you should watch the film again. Not because I have to, but also want to with my heart. I've been waiting for a film like this for years, which is one of a number of other classics like Memento, Inception and Prestige. A film that still makes me ponder for weeks and months.CameraThe camera work is sensational and beautiful to look at in IMAX 4K MAXX. Especially when it comes to explosive scenes, because I can remember in one scene the protagonist and the others run away from an explosion and the detonation cracks down stones and rubble and it looked so real that I thought it was that real rubble? You can see quite well how close it was to the actors. I can't say whether it was CGI or not, but it looked lifelike to me. The camera harmonizes wonderfully with the sound effects and the music. I love this futuristic sound with the bass behind it and it conveys a serious and somewhat dark mood.ActorsJohn David Washington is certainly not an actor who got the role just because of his father. I know him from Blakkklansman and he was great there, but here in Tenet he has reached another level. His dialogues and especially his expression of how he says something comes across as very authentic.Robert Pattinson showed an extraordinary performance. His gestures and facial expressions, the way he moves were incredible for someone I have judged for Twilight. I've never watched Twilight, but I've watched Harry Potter. And no matter how good or how bad an actor is, if he delivers like in Tenet Robert Pattinson, then directors like C. Nolan see more potential in him than we do. I'm looking forward to The Batman. Have nothing but love and respect for his work."
2647,"It's very good but it goes sooooo fast. I know this will be a reason why some people will dislike the movie. I'm gonna see it again and then i'll get it but i get that some people don't want to watch a movie twice to get the plot.The action was very well shot and all around amazing, the soundtrack was ok? i guess... kinda disappointed in the absence of Zimmer but i guess it don't hurt to change things up sometimes.What i really missed in this film was some moments to let your mind process what just happened. Like a scene will happen and then the next one is already going while you're still processing what just happened. There was also not really a 'bro' moment between Protagonist and Neil. Really just a lack of any emotional scene at all.In my opinion this movie is like 2 movies wrapped into one long movie and they cut out all the emotional scenes to make room for ACTION, ACTION and more ACTION!!!"
2648,It would be hard to spoil as I couldn't find the words to explain it or really understand it anyway. Just watched for the first time and about watch again. Just sit back and enjoy the ride.
2649,"Tenet is a film that is releasing on the big screen after a lengthy spell of absence of cinema due to covid19.
What a film to kickstart the reopening of cinemas!!! For all the cinema lovers starved from watching on the big screen this is the best film to reinitiate you.The beginning action scene sets the right tone for the rest of the story to unravel. Background score although for the first time not composed by Hans Zimmer is top quality and lifts the film.Time inversion concept is brought in with brilliant dialogues.
The plane crashing scene has been done real time and with no VFX and will be an iconic scene for years to come. Some of the dialogues will be legendary.Washington has carried the film brilliantly well and so have Pattinson and Dimple Kapadia aptly supported.
Must warn you it is a 150 min long film but you will enjoy it every minute of the spectacle.A typical Nolan film that will engage your brains and will make you watch it multiple times to join the dots. Well worth it and lots more!!!"
2650,"Nolan is mixed bag. While he is always capable of churning out intellectual concepts, dense scripts and mind blowing non CGI action set pieces, his films also suffer greatly from choppy editing, overstuffed exposition, awkward direction, and most of all, confusion. I love Nolan films. They remind the general audience of that movies can make you think (Charlie Kaufman, Steve Carruth). Tenet is no different, a typical Nolan fare, aggrandizing both his filmmaking genius and flaws to their maximum.The first half of the movie is one of the most lackluster pieces of cinema Nolan has ever concocted in his career, although it is nothing new for Nolan films to bore people at the beginning. However, I would argue that Inception did a better job at its ""inception"" than Tenet, albeit sharing similar conceptual goals. Everything is unimpressive until the movie introduces it core concepts, which is when it becomes a hell of a ride, a veritable mind twister that puts everything into perspective, much like what Memento did.The crazy plot of the film will take multiple rewatches to decipher. The ambition of Nolan might have eschewed other crucial elements of good filmmaking, and it may come off as full of himself, but at the end of the day, Nolan films are must sees. I would recommend this to masochist who intends to hamper the integrity and tranquility of their minds."
2651,"Now this movie really begs of you to listen, to watch and to be there for the whole thing. You can get not just the just of it in one viewing, but you can understand it - although as the movie itself tells the protagonist, sometimes it is ok to just ""feel it"". And that is something you most certainly can do. Anyone can do that.One thing I would recommend (if you like the genre that is of course, because if you're not open to this mind bender, than you're wasting your time anyway), is to watch this on the biggest screen possible. The best way to watch this is apparently the BFI in London (IMAX). That is of August 2020 speaking, there are cinemas being build even during the pandemic, one in the south of Germany, which has as a goal to be the biggest screen worldwide. Now just check where an Imax is and if you can attend to a screening there. Otherwise just choose another screen, but try to watch it in cinemas. Hopefully you're not too afraid because of Corona and your cinemas are still open and do everything they can to be safe.Talking about safe. That is one of the goals of our main protagonist. Even if he doesn't know it yet - or maybe he does? Is it complex? For sure and that's a good thing. While driving to the cinema (Imax) we watched this at (with a couple of friends), we got into traffic and were a bit late. So we did miss the first couple of minutes and were told of them. Not just because of that I will watch it again. And yet I still got it. I would even say that if you've seen the odd movie here and there, you will be able to know certain things (""twists"" or revelations).I can not stress out enough how visually amazing this is, but we knew that of Christopher Nolan. The sound design is amazing too, soundtrack heightens everything - and the acting is top notch. Now one of the points I felt was not done very well, was the ""sailing"" scene. You almost couldn't understand them at all. Most of the other stuff wasn't that bad. But again and as said before twice: you've got to feel it - so do you feel it?"
2652,"Before you review this film watch IT twice!
I am not a great writer but i loved it and i am going once again to watch it just to find explanations for my Q"
2653,"Tenet: Spys at the sharp end of Black-Ops, Time Travel, a Bond style Super Villain Sator (Kenneth Branagh). We even get Michael Caine as a senior MI6 spook. But mainly we see The Protagonist (John David Washington) and his sidekick Neil (Robert Pattinson). Great portrayals of teams of agents moving backwards through time whist other teams move forward. At different times in the film we see some scenes from differing directions. Difficult to explain, you have to see it. Also munitions which move backwards throgh time, nasty if you get shot by them Elizabeth Debicki is Kat, Sator's estranged wife who has her own agenda for helping The Protagonist. Great battle scenes, (watch buildings reconstruct themselves!) car chases, again back and forward in time. I'll have to watch this again to fully understand it. Written and Directed by Christopher Nolan. 9/10."
2654,"Tenet is definitely going to be one of those movies which people would enjoy watching over and over and discover something new each time.The movie might be too cerebral for the average movie goer, but it's a treat for the true movie fans who are willing to invest themselves in the movie. The concept of time travel is dumbed down enough for the masses while still keeping the plot airtight.The best way to enjoy Tenet is to watch it once, let the ideas marinate in your mind for a day and watch it again to have your mindblown again.This movies leaves you wanting more of the brilliant concept and world it portraits. A sequel to Tenet would be awesome. Nolan has single handedly pushed the envelope in the journal of spy movies. The bar has been raised!"
2655,"The best action espionage of all time , you have to see this film at least 5 times to understand it , i think nolan did the right thing, the protagonist should not be introduced . Nolan most not shows the past of protagonist character and he did the right thing because in this genre the mystery of the informer is so important."
2656,"Amazing Direction, superb acting.. full of thrilling scenes.. complicated yet still easy to catch the flow.. action scenes are ""PAISA WASOOL"""
2657,"Continue from previous post...
This part is the key to understand the movie. If one gets it right, getting the final scene is a pure pleasure, like non I enjoyed before.D) And few words from heart:
For Westworld series I wrote: Thanks God for the Nolans. (taken from Alan Jackson's Thanks God for the Radio)
It feels good that every once in a while between thousands of movies and series made not for me, one is made for guys/gals like me). To satisfy and fulfill our minds like non. To bring our minds to challenge. How many there? Matrix, Lucy, other Nolans. In stage plays, there was just one: Powdered Milk by Navid Memarzadeh which I assume you hadn't heard of. You might find it on YouTube. These movie/series/plays make me feel less like a stranger and alone. It's brilliant to feel someone else sees the world and its challenges the way I do. And he is actually doing something with it. Bravo.
Tenet is one of those mind opening movies. Introduces things which we don't face in ordinary life. Puts new ideas in mind. The result? We should wait more than a decade to see the results in ""Prosperities""
It's not about physics theories, it's about opening some peoples mind to things that science has accepted as Possible Realities or as we say: TENET
I remember when Martix first came, some 20 years ago, many didn't accept it. Some watched it as an action-thriller movie. But to many of us young people, it was a mind opening and energizing. Tenet and other Nolan movies will do the same to prosperities. Young ones watching these movies will have more open minds and more conscious. Kids yet to come which Max(Cath and Andrei's child) represents them in Tenet.
Kids who will be our prosperities. So they may help us as they would answer our call for help without us even being sure if the threat is real or not. Like the final scene."
2658,"Once again seizing control of the medium, Nolan attempts to alter the fabric of reality, or at least blow the roof off the multiplexes. Big, bold, baffling and bonkers."
2659,Best movie so far by Nolan.I needed to watch it two times to understand the movie. Their is no explanation in the movie about whats happening. So you have to understand on your own
2660,"If you love mystery, have an active imagination and love when a film doesn't assume you are dumb, then TENET is for you.Skip it if otherwise, because then it will DEFINITELY go over your head.And yeah, for the first time in a long while, I'd actually love a sequel."
2661,I didn't understand it thats all very complicated stufff
2662,"Outstanding from the word go. Everything in Tenet is just amazing, the soundtrack is right up there with inception and interstellar."
2663,"I don't know why people keep complaining about this movie and say you have to watch it more than once to understand it.
Tenet is perfect, Nolan just confirmed that he is the brilliants director of all time, he is a scientist. The story and how he delivers it, there is no such a perfect way.
Thank you Mr. Nolan for this epic experience, thanks for the amazing cast:
John David Washington
Robert Pattinson
Elizabeth Debicki
Kenneth Branagh"
2664,"It's jus insane
The soundtrack
The acting
Jus INSANE"
2665,"Waited long to watch this movie on big screen, enjoyed the BGM, locations, and screen play once you come out of theatre after watching 1st tym, u want to watch it again and against"
2666,Don't fall for negative reviews dumb people won't get the plot . I realise what a masterpiece nolan created omg.
2667,Tenet was that movie that audience Will not understand by the mean time
2668,"I just want to say that this is the best movie of the century or maybe the best movie ever....but if you don't want to think and blow your head don't see it...it is a complex movie, is enjoying complexity..."
2669,"Christopher Nolan is known for getting the bar higher with each one of his movies, and he's been doing so since the beginning... and Memento was precisely 20 years ago!For credit's sakes, he usually does it with team Nolan, with his brother.This masterpiece is not made for just one time watch and to be commented and reviewed before you, yourself, go trough the temporal pincer of watching it again... and only then putting it all together. It's kinda like trying to review The Matrix Project (trilogy and animatrix) after just seeing the first movie... clearly not enough and really unfair!!The score is awesome, the actors are impeccable, editing is outstanding (specially in a movie with so many ""moving parts""), photography is remarkingly competent and the phenomenal directing (and writing) stitches all together in a truly masterpiece kind of work that throws you a first punch to the gut, rolls you several times in a coming rumbling wave and in the end flabbergasts you into awe. It truly is that good!As far as genre, one could say it's Memento, Back To The Future, James Bond and Mission Impossible all put together in a blender... and then some!!Saw it two times with subtitles, watched some reviews on YouTube and I'm still eager to watch it again... that's how good this cinematography experience truly is!"
2670,This is one of the best movies and most complex film of all time. This is ×5 complex than inception. It should be watched atleast 3 times to realise that tenet is a masterpiece. Don't believe any bad reviews. Those ppl would have never understood the plot and science behind this film.
2671,"After watching the movie, I was in awe of the masterpiece which Christopher Nolan have created in such a beautiful manner. It was such a brilliant piece of art by the director who's known for it. The movie is over confusing and isn't coherent at all which makes it special. The work of each and every actor was brilliant as well. Overall, the movie is a tightly packed action masterpiece."
2672,I didnt understand everything about the way of this movie but its still legend.
2673,"At first I didn't understood anything, but after doing some research everything started making sense, it's a movie for thinking and re-watching and it may not be interesting to everyone, but the cinematography is absolutely amazing as well as the performances."
2674,"I watched this movie for the first time last night and have had it on my mind since then. The story is so complicated but put together so well. I feel that in order to understand everything perfectly I would need to watch it 5 more times. The soundtrack was fabulous. It perfectly fits what's going on in the scenes and builds a suspenseful atmosphere. The acting was brilliant. I love Kenneth Branagh in this, he should be nominated for an Oscar. Washington and Pattinson were both amazing. They had a great chemistry. Christopher Nolan's movies always seem to have great visuals and effects, but this movie nearly surpasses Inception. It is phenomenal."
2675,Its honestly like a parody on a christopher nolan film.. music n acting was amazing though
2676,"Well, it finally arrived, and Tenet was...a spectacle, of sorts. That can never be taken away from the king of practical effects and 70mm IMAX thunder vision. Plot-wise, don't even try to wrap your head around the time traveling paradox. Not worth the effort. And forget about finding any character development, because clearly director Nolan had no interest in making a film for adults.He cast a no-name with shall we say limited range in the lead - John David Washington - a nice looking, athletic actor, but lacking stature, posture and gravitas of any kind. Nolan's gangly, morose blond Brit, Elizabeth Debicki - half a foot taller than our hero - is a femme fatale of sorts, but with a heart. She isn't out of the Bond girl mold, that's for sure. Perhaps the times we live in dictated more representation from the towering volleyball-playing crowd.The antagonist Andrei Sator is played by the veteran actor/director Kenneth Branagh. He could have phoned in his performance, and while it is not objectionable, it also is not noteworthy. It is sufficient. I'm not sure anybody could have done his part any better, considering the material; plenty could have done it worse, though.The action is well paced and virtually non-stop. Missing is any sense of levity or humor or human emotions that would have served to flesh out the characters and make us care for them. This movie is deadly earnest. Only Robert Pattinson's Neil, who assist our protagonist in saving the world, draws our empathy and a twinge of concern. He's the only person in Tenet who seems to be enjoying himself in the least - the indomitable optimist even when facing overwhelming opposition and slim chances. His acting chops are bonafide, and I look forward to seeing him in anything he does in the future.Tenet is about as entertaining as you'd expect a film to be, if the director decided to extrapolate one interesting idea (that characters and objects can go forward and backward in time simultaneously) into 150 minutes of visual and audio pummeling by paradox. Your psyche may be bruised from sitting through this film in its entirety.Nolan is a writer/director to be admired for the chances he takes, and his dedication to realism in resisting the CGI revolution. Tenet gets 5 stars for the amazing visual effects, but it could have been so, so much more."
2677,"When I first watched the trailer I thought It was going to be one of those movies like ""Shutter Island"", ""Inception"" and other famous titles that leave you with a grudge (a nice grudge) at the end. You know those that makes you want to dig your nails into your keyboard to find out if leonardo wore his ring at the end of the inception movie to see if he was dreaming or not.The beginning of this movie was harsh and I can see how people might dislike it a lot because of that. Since it gives no context what-soever to the story we're watching.The only thing it did was ""Kill"" the protagonist, therefore leaving him to look into the inversion phenomenon.
And if you were allready put off by this, then the rest of the movie probably wasn't, or won't be pleasent for you.
it cuts off harshly and if you don't pay attention, you will lose track of it.But I'm not one of those people, that's reviewing this badly because he/she didn't understand it and now I'm angry and want to provoce those feelings, by rating this titel badly. No, I am not that kind of person.My complaint is that I understood it too well, I did not leave with questions, that could not be answered by, someone who had stronger ears than me, because they heard the text better, Over the very loud Music (this was also a very big problem, espescially if the subtitles do not match the text, when you actually hear the lines, spoken by the actors).Every mistery, every complication and thought was explained and it was like listening to a lecture that you allready heard before.
when the protagonist is trying to get through the door and there's a dead body behind it, with a special keychain, DO NOT, show us the keychain on Neil (the protagonists Friend/partner) in slow motion, so that every mororn understands he was the one that died for him. leave it a mistery just like with inception.
Everytime he is in the dream, he wears a ring, at the end he doesn't, case closed, but only if you watch it more than twice.Tenet is a one Ticket see, all complications are easely explained, just like the grandfather paradox which is mentionned more than twice in this movie.(you can't kill your grandfather, before one of your parents were concieved, since it would kill you, therefore killing the future you who's killing his grandfather. a paradox). When the protagonist says ""If we're alive now, doesn't that mean we succeeded?"", and neil answering, with the timeline theory, giving us slight doubt. And yet at the end the thing the characters have been screaming in our faces, that it can't really happen because of the paradox and so on, turns out to be true, WHAT A COINCIDENCE.Anyone who didn't understand this movie either didn't wan't to, didn't care to, didn't know what they were about to watch or just stuck on each thing they didn't understand.I kind of knew/guessed that Neil was from the future the first time we saw him, because that's a big cliche in movies like this. ""Tadaa I actually knew you from the begining and didn't mention it, but now since you saw my keychain and know I am going to die, why not tell it now.""I just want to say if you just opened my comment and start from the bottom to see how I end it, please read with care, this movie is ok yet decieving for what it promises.Thank you for reading so far if you did.I enjoy reviewing movies with a critical eye, since it helps me let go of mistakes I've made, like thinking this movie was going to be awsome."
2678,"So far Tenet is my favorite movie of 2020 and was my most anticipated film of the year. Seeing The Hunt in March had me thinking how long it would be before I would go back to the theaters. Tenet was the movie I wanted to see so bad when theaters reopened and I loved it!Tenet is a brilliantly directed and edited film thanks to Christopher Nolan's creative mind! The acting is great and the action scenes had me on the edge of my seat. Loved the music score and every moment of the story.
My biggest issues with Tenet was that it felt a little bit too long from the first 20 minutes and last 30 minutes, if it was shortened a little bit then it would have been perfectly fine pacing. Another thing is that sometimes the audio with explosions, gunshots, or intense music scores made it hard for me to hear any dialogue and maybe if there were subtitles it could have been acceptable.
Overall I loved Tenet and it's so far my favorite movie of the year. Score: 8.5/10. Grade: A-"
2679,"One of the best cinema-going experiences I've ever had. The 'inversion' aspect really isn't that hard to grasp, however the story itself will make you work to understand it. The set pieces are unlike anything I've seen before, and I thought the cast and acting were understated and intriguing, exactly what a film with these themes requires.
Personally I didn't have an issue with sound or understanding dialogue; the overall mix feels raw and punchy, further immersing you into this world. The score is one of the best I've heard (and felt!) - Razor sharp synths with a sinuous blend of organic and electronic textures, tribal beats and cavernous bass. Awesome! I personally didn't think this film was too loud, rather that how Nolan has mixed down the elements plays with 'perceived loudness'. Not only will the story and visuals challenge you, the sound design will as well.
It's a visceral film that will hammer your senses and if you're looking for an easy going experience with the usual linear story-tropes and score, then this is not for you...Perhaps wait for Bond to reappear in November? I'm not knocking Bond but it's hardly unfamiliar territory.
Once in a while a Director comes along that crafts something that is much more than just your standard blockbuster movie; it's evolution. Some just aren't ready for it yet."
2680,"This was not Chris Noaln's best, but still entertaining to watch. I would recommend a good first view."
2681,"Is there anything new in this movie about time travelling that we haven't seen already? You bet there is! If you liked Dark (Netflix) then you will be familiar with the bootstrap/grandfather paradox. If else, u can always watch a quick YT video before hitting the theaters and believe me you will need it. The movie will be confusing, dry with no humor in the first half. But if you manage to observe most of the details then you are in for a real treat as the latter half is mind blowing. Blown away by the acting of John David Washington. He really held the movie together. Having said all that, I probably have to watch it a few more times."
2682,"Another weekend where a delayed product finally unleashes to the theaters given the delays by COVID. Tonight's review is an interesting piece from the mind of the psychologically teasing Christopher Nolan ,the man who brought you Inception and Interstellar in their odd glory. Nolan's work is legendary on many levels as you know, standing out for its weird concepts, mind bending concepts/twists, and true dive into Sci-Fi genre themes. So after all the work up and a very interesting trailer, we finally get to see the work unfold. What's this reviewer's thoughts? Robbie K here to share his thoughts as we review:Movie: Tenet (2020)Director:
Christopher Nolan
Writer:
Christopher Nolan
Stars:
John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki
LIKES:Fantastic Acting
Rather Fast Pace
Clever use of technology
True Science Fiction Plot
Unique Ideas and Fight Sequences
Nets your Attention By Making You think
Good twists
The Visuals and Special EffectsDislikes:The Action Scenes Are A Bit Underwhelming At Times
The Muffled Voices At Time can a bit Troubling
The Jargon heavy descriptions are dense and boring at times
So Stacked Is It Fun?After a wonderful performance in BlackKKlansman, is it any surprise that Washington is able to take a role and run with it? The man works well to take the monotone presentation of The Protagonist and somehow adds layers to it that give him more depth. Around the intriguing mystery of the movie, the Protagonist has mystery behind him that allows for an intriguing performance to be delivered. Debicki as Kat does a wonderful job in her strong role, a complicated chess piece that goes through more emotional spectrum than anyone else in this film and does it so well to be believable engaging, and empowering without being in your face. Kenneth Branagh as the antagonist Andrei has the look, feel, and sinister method that I love to see in a villain, a prime example of Nolan's ability to develop a villain that really fits the title well. Yet the biggest surprise for me was Pattinson, as the former shiny vampire/heartthrob knocks this convoluted role out of the park, making a likeable, complex supporting role that I absolutely loved, and perhaps redeeming other roles I've seen him in.
Acting aside, the movie succeeds on many fronts for this reviewer, achieving the goal of being 150 minutes and not feeling that slow or drawn out (which other movies have failed for me.). Tenet's pace hits the ground running, but manages to balance stride and sprint parts to make a balanced presentation that gives enough details without falling asleep. As many reviews have said, there is a James Bond aesthetic mixed in with several other movies that made for a good use of clever tools that were not too far down the fiction path. It's by not over using the gadgets that the unique plot starts really coming out, allowing the story and concepts to take center stage while the action and stunts serve their purpose of supporting and adding excitement. The fight sequences are not overly flashy, and hold a unique air about them (well most of them do) that circle about the core concept and feel very at home with Nolan's focused theme, while at the same time showing off the technology this film uses so well. Other ideas that seem ridiculous, are somehow layered and fleshed out to stay on the pulse of reality while also not being too stale or boring that so many films fail at. What all this wraps up to is a strong Science Fiction plot, that dives away from fantasy and allows the unique atmosphere to thrive on and keep you hooked on the story that is presented. Tenet's brilliance is the engaging mystery, or in this case mysteries, that you are trying to solve, digging into the complicated world and trying to understand and guess the twists that Nolan has built into the plot. And most if not all of these twists are good... and again fit well into the physics of this bizarre spin on our world. True, I did guess much of them to some degree, but I was impressed at how well-integrated they are and not forced or wedged as some movies thrive in.
Yet the highlight of the movie for me outside of the writing is the technology that was executed super well. Cinematography wise it's beautifully detailed, multiangle, dynamic goodness that immerses you into the film. Computer graphic wise, it brings the Tenet spin to life beautifully in the form of combat sequences, property manipulation, and weird fights with great attention to detail that seldom crosses into fake territory. As for the sound and music, well the bullet sounds are in loud definition and not too out of the ordinary, but pay attention to the music during certain moments and you might be impressed by the audio cues that will help orient you to the maze this movie is.As you know with my reviews though, there are areas of improvement for me I would have loved to see improved if I could. While the action scenes fit very well in the scope of this world, to call this movie an action film is a bit of an understatement. Sure there are exciting parts, but some parts at the end lacked the flare or even aim that I like my thrillers to have. I can't say much to not ruin things, but the end fight has a lot of coordination, but there blind shooting at unseen enemies is not my idea of the perfect ending some say it is. I would have liked to see Nolan's concept with a little more finesse and excitement to help add that tension he did in inception and Dark Knight. Something that might have been due to my theater's speakers was the muffled voices. Nolan's direction for delivering a very jargon filled movie is sometimes quite muffled, almost like a sound bar without an equalizer that can't find the balance between dialogue and special effect scenes. For a movie where details and dialogue are important, I kind of would have liked to have some better voice editing, but again could just be me. As for the Jargon, it's a great way to explain what is going on, but there is a quote in the movie that states trying to understand it will only make things complicated and you have to accept it. A lot of the explanations are convoluted and help shape the world piece by piece, but there are times the technical heavy jargon's attempts get a little long winded, boring, and may make things worse in terms of the trying to understand the presentation. Many of those who don't want complex dialogue and lines are going to hate much of the writing in this film, and even those who enjoy some thought provoking lines may also find Nolan went a little deeper than many would enjoy. Which brings me to the biggest piece to analyze, is Tenet too complicated? He has teased my brain plenty of times in the past, but the level this film does may take it to the level only Sheldon Cooper would enjoy the most. Tenet's layers are deep, confusing, constantly changing, and requiring absolute focus to the movie to get it. Trying to figure out the order of events and all the connections your first go around might be frustrating, which succeeds in multiple viewings, but at the same time is not going to be the best for the casual goer.The Verdict:The wait was worth it for me and I can say that Nolan delivers the same bizarre, truly Sci-Fi themed tale that he is so good at delivering. It's thought provoking, unique, with a layered tale that takes the gimmick, incorporates it well, and keeps you hooked into the plot. So many special effects and sequences support the theme well, and I was impressed by the actors making the characters come to life in a spectacle that was refreshing to see. Yet, this monster film is going to have a lot of layers and if you have a short attention span or only want entertainment factors made famous by modern cinema, this film is not going to be for you. Some unbalanced sound effects, a heavy emphasis on jargon filled dialogue, and action scenes that need some tweaking to help get the full effect. However, it might be the convoluted nature of the film that could be its undoing, the attempt to mess with your mind taken a little too far that I think takes away from the story he has presented. Again, it will lead to multiple watches, but I think Nolan needed to take a step back and simplify things for this project to maintain the balance. Still I certainly enjoyed this film and I agree that it is a movie needed to be experienced in the theater for its presentation, story, and special effects.My scores are:Action/Sci-Fi: 8.0
Movie Overall: 8.0"
2683,"Walking out of the theatre I still had a few small questions, mainly some in between ''what/how'/plot holes'' but I understood it for about 90%. Still resulting in a fantastic movie. I think my experience with Season 2 of Westworld helped me understand the the way time works much quicker. Without it, I can certainly understand being confused for a much longer time.That said it clicked with me once the camera focused on that little orange strap on reverse time Neil's backpack. This shot was obviously meant to be a clue.Now the performances of the actors are mostly fantastic. I think Kat takes the throne. With Neil behind, Andre after and The Protagonist 4th. And that's not because his performance was bad by any means, it was just written very flat because his eventual final role makes sense for it to be flat so that his transformation would be less jarring. But that also hindered the movie a ton as he was the main focus. And the main critique I have of this movie is that it's just very serious, flat and to the point. Neil sometimes gets some lighthearted-ness in their, but not much.The main villain also felt just a bit lacking for me. Perhaps a bit in line with the main lead, he lacked that special flair to make him interesting.The score is AMAZING, BUT definitely a must watch in theatre or with a good bass-y home theatre. Because most of the suspense and elements used are bass. The impact of most of the action scenes would lose quite a lot without good bass. I say this because there isn't really a motif, or a recognizable tune in this movie. I can instantly think of the Inception or Interstellar theme, but not for Tenet.A thing I can't skip when talking about Tenet is the action, wow, Nolan has outdone himself with all the live action. It paid off, just the viscosity of the events are a thrill to watch. That said, the actual fights and choreography leave something to be desired (not regarding the forward/reverse sections). Also this movie is barely graphic at all and to my opinion it held some moments back.Further on the last final battle scene was intense, a sight to see and just amazing all around but felt messy. You really had no clue of what the enemy was doing at all. The main focus was on the good guys shooting at ''things''. There was no dynamic between the two sides. Which made the entire battle really lackluster in that department.Talking about that final battle scene, that's where the storyline also makes itself a little bit more complex. With Neil going backward and forward in time. In between the two teams going backward and forward.The editing and story overall was not that crazy interesting. And I wish we got more time with the forward/backward mechanic. The first half of the movie is pretty hectic and cuts very quickly between locations. This movie takes no time at all to show any sort of travel or passing of time. One shot you are in India, the next you are in London. That said the film looks really good visually. Shots are nicely set up and the lighting looked fantastic.Overall I recommend this movie, definitely have a good sound system though.
8/10 , negatives are lack of engaging characters and lack of dynamic during final battle."
2684,"To make sense of this film, I would have to see it multiple times, preferably with subtitles. The subtitles would not only help me to understand the spoken dialogue better but they would also help with following the plot, as this movie is very fast-paced. This, combined with the fact that a single watch is not enough for the average person to understand this movie leads me to the conclusion that you're probably better off renting or buying the movie than watching it in the cinema. I still recommend that you do watch it though, as it's a very unique and entertaining experience."
2685,"I liked the theme a lot but couldn't care much for the movie itself. Didn't get invested in the characters because nothing is given much backstory, and what you do get is often a bit cliché (the arms dealer, his wife, big shoot out at the end etc)
Tenet feels like a ""let's make another inception but a few things changed"". By far not my favourite CN movie."
2686,"The sound mixing/design is absolutely terrible! The beginning of this movie is very important to the story and since the explosions and loud gun shots plus the masks on our characters faces make it extremely hard to hear what anyone is saying. And this is a constant problem throughout the film. I had to leave the first showing I saw of this, which was in IMAX because it was so loud that it was hurting my ears and I've seen movies in IMAX before and not had a problem. So on my second viewing it was still terribly loud. Other than that, the story, acting, and dialogue is perfected. It's a difficult movie to understand all around because it moves fast and the sound sucks, but I definitely recommend it. Just not in IMAX lmao!"
2687,"It's the only time I've ever walked out backwards from a theatre - bloody time inversion. I tried to follow it all , I really did but by end I was totally confused and felt it was all too much. I'm going to wait for the dvd so I can watch with subtitles and then at least understand what they were all saying and hope then make some sense of the plot . I'll even be able to rewind, sorry- time invert to follow the plot. The music was deafening. Oxygen masks for all made it a real competition to identify who's who. The action was exciting and the acting good so it wasn't all a loss."
2688,"Arguably, Christopher Nolan is one of the greatest directors of the modern era. Much like his films themselves, there are levels to his work. On one level he makes visually stunning movies and on another level genre-bending high concept thrillers that forever challenge and question the very nature of time itself. In short, the man creates art, not films. It should be no surprise to anyone that Nolan has finally gotten around to the spy field. So the reel question is will Tenet be more Hurst than Dali?Somehow Christopher Nolan knows how to take an idea that would be either laughable or ridicules in another director's hands and make is spellbinding. His work is forever walking the fine line between the sublime and the ludicrous. In Tenet, Nolan finally takes on the concept of time travel and it's real-world applications. Here he has come closer than any other director in history to speak on both the science and the purpose of time travel in our modern world.It would be a mistake to not say for much of the story Tenet is incredibly confusing. The opening sequence in particular outright doesn't make sense. The opera scene is beautiful to watch but even when the credits roll it leaves far too many unanswered questions. However, through pure will power alone Nolan still somehow beats his movie into submission and ultimately creates a failed masterpiece.That's the problem when you create such unique and challenging pieces, not all of them will be perfect. While I struggle to find anything to criticise about the film directly it was still somehow lacking for this critic. I just didn't enjoy it. There was no fun or laughter to be had. It was if Nolan had traded the amusement for the scientific and all the fantastical for the practical.Of course, Tenet does have grand set pieces and truly outstanding sequences but I don't feel like they can compensate for what feels like a cold-hearted movie. There is something altogether too surgical to Tenet for my liking, perhaps it was the pacing was too sporadic or maybe it was one step of madness to far but whatever it is, it kept me from loving the film.Tenet feels like a film with more brains than heart, which is the reverse of Nolan's other work. Lenny is motivated by the death of his wife, Dom wants to see his kids again and Cooper wants to save the world for his kids. In contrast, John David Washington's character (simply referred to as ""The Protagonist"") is motivated by a curiosity to pull on a string and see where it leads. There is a subplot involving an entrapped woman attempting to save herself and child from the monstrous Sator but that never feels like The Protagonist's driving force.Much like my previous references to art, Tenet is like a Picasso places on a wall in a beautiful frame that just can never quite hang right.Tenet is as close to perfect as you will find, but when you are Christopher Nolan, perfect just isn't enough.10 time-travelling bullets out of 10"
2689,Nolan is perfect. All his movies are perfect and all the cast of them.
2690,"...because his best for me remains Interstellar which is simply extraordinary. Tenet is smart, albeit not as brain twisting as you might expect, and it's perfectly acted out, even by his royal thespness King Ken. But I didn't care about the characters or what was at stake like I did those in Interstellar and the movie is oddly grey visually. The novelty of time trickery is no longer that novel and whilst interesting the whole concept was just not enough to keep me entranced."
2691,"One questions really came up in my mind so many times during this movie and that is ""why""? Why doing a move where the script is so complicated so nobody really understand what's going on?Or... is there really anything going on? Is there are story? I'm not sure. It just feels... empty and leave you indifferent."
2692,"We are back from the movie theater where we went to see TENET. It's a kind of James Bond movie mixed with science fiction (temporal displacements) whose basic plot is simple: find the mysterious object that could annihilate our world.
But there are some inconsistencies in terms of temporal displacements or travel. No doubt Christopher Nolan will find all sorts of explanations for these apparent (if not obvious) inconsistencies.
What is always a bit disappointing in Nolan's films is that women play secondary or even ""thirdary"" roles. Women exist there only to be saved or killed. And his male and female main characters never manage to love each other completely. One always loves the other while the other does not love him/her or not as much. And his MCs are always caught between dream and reality (Inception), between past and future (Tenet), between this dimension and another (Interstellar) or even between different copies of themselves (The Prestige, Transcendance). This must be the consequence of his many trips between mom (Chicago) and dad (London) when he was a child.
So it lacks a bit of emotion as well. Or too preoccupied with giving us Action with a capital ""A"" and Special Effects with a capital ""S"", Nolan forgets about Emotion with a capital ""E"".
Despite these caveats, the film is worth seeing in theatres. The actors said they felt like they were really in the action. But they were really there. Everything is as real as it can be: the plane exploding, the cars speeding in reverse on the highway, etc. It's all as real as it gets. It's not just special effects on a green background. It's happening for real in front of our eyes. And it's fascinating."
2693,"We went to the movies last night and it felt damn good. ""Tenet"" is directed by the masterful Christopher Nolan and our first theatre experience since the lockdown was certainly not a relaxing one. If you thought ""Inception"" was tough to crack then brace yourself for a much more challenging watch but also one that is very rewarding.""Tenet"" explores the idea of time-inversion and the role it can play in both causing and preventing catastrophic events. John's David Washington's protagonist learns the rules of this game and is brought on board to help prevent the apocalypse. The complexity of this story may go without saying but from a visual standpoint - watching it unfold was an absolute joy to watch.Nolan, yet again, pushes the limits of blockbuster filmmaking with massive and inventive practical effects. The scale and design of the action set pieces are of the highest quality and there are numerous moments when Ludwig Göransson's score swells with the chaos on screen and reminds me of just why I love going to the movies. Hoyte Van Hoytema has worked with Nolan since ""Interstellar"" and every frame of this film is absolutely stunning to look at.For a film as epic and complex as ""Tenet"", we rely on exposition and having the information from the world delivered in a coherent and competent way. While the sound design for the action was incredible, the dialogue was very hard to hear. After reading a synopsis of the film there were a lot of details from the story that I missed and left me confused a number of times. This may be an issue with IMAX but I have seen many similar complaints which makes me think otherwise.The performances are all very good but because the details of the narrative are so dense, the screenplay doesn't dedicate a lot of time to making you care for the characters. This mostly works for ""Tenet"" because exploring the time-inversion requires a lot of the runtime but giving us a little more to attach ourselves with the characters could have led to a stronger emotional journey.Christopher Nolan is one of my favourite filmmakers and movies like ""Tenet"" just cement my adoration for his work. He challenges the viewer's expectations because doing so leads to pure creativity in both story and visual design. Additional background for the characters and tweaking with the dialogue mix could have had some improvements but ""Tenet"" is most definitely worth seeing and experiencing on the big screen...just don't forget your mask!"
2694,"Out of all the movies releasing in 2020, Tenet was my most anticipated. Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite directors. I've enjoyed all of his previous movies except for Following and Insomnia. If I were to pick my favorite Nolan movie, it would definitely be a tie between The Dark Knight and Inception. While Tenet is still a good movie, I would consider it to be one of his lesser ones.My biggest issue with Tenet is the same gripe I had with Interstellar: the dialogue can barely be heard. While watching the movie, I could only understand 10% of the conversations. This made the story very difficult to follow at times. My enjoyment of Tenet would significantly improve once I'm able to watch it at home with subtitles.Besides the audio issues, I thought everything else was good. By far, the best part about Tenet was its action sequences. All of the set pieces were creative and entertaining. If Tenet doesn't win the Oscar for Best Visual Effects this year, I would be shocked.Overall, Tenet was a decent Nolan movie. It's not as entertaining as The Dark Knight or as emotionally impactful as Inception, but it's still an impressive feat of filmmaking. Until Tenet comes to home video, I give this movie a 7/10."
2695,"The film clearly resembles other science fiction movies. One can recognize similar scenes and script elements from iconic films such as the Back to the future trilogy and the Matrix trilogy, as well as newer ones like Looper and Nolan's own Inception and Interstellar. Nevertheless, Nolan manages to give his personal touch to the script and create something complex and entertaining.Having also seen Inception, The Dark Knight trilogy and Interstellar, Nolan's directing and writing style are found here too. He often has ambitious ideas, can build impressive action scenes and create entertaining cinematic experiences with high production value. However, as a screenwriter, his dialogue lacks depth when writing about human relationships. It feels inauthentic, it's often unnecessarily complex, superfluous or shallow, compromising an otherwise impressive scene (e.g. ***** SPOILER: Extremely important scene towards the end, where the character portrayed by Debicki kills the bad guy sooner than planned, knowing that this could destroy the entire planet! And then she says on the phone to her colleague, ""I killed him earlier. I couldn't wait. It won't matter, unless you didn't do it (the thing he was suppose to do). Tell me you did do it, huh? ""******).Regarding the performances, the lead actor (Washington) was probably the right person for the role. Whether intentionally or not, he highlighted the story instead of the character. Pattinson's interpretation was weak and Debicki's nothing outstanding. Finally, Branagh's performance was completely flat - he didn't feel like the character but rather like putting on a performance of the role. That's why his performance was the same from beginning to end (same voice, same look) and he weakened a very important character that should have been riveting since he was basically the core of the story.On the other hand, what was impressive and unique was the ""time reversal"" scenes mixed with real time. The editing, sound design and music enhanced the action scenes while the production design was equally impressive and without any (noticeable) CGI.Overall, the film was ambitious. It had its drawbacks but it was complex and entertaining. The fact that important information about the plot was revealed slowly during the film and that there were things we were contemplating even after the film ended, are what kept the viewers engaged throughout. We left the open-air theater entertained! And I will gladly watch it again."
2696,"Nolan loves to challenge audience with his screen play.
This film engage with time inversion. shows forward and inverted at the same time unlike other Time travel movies which shows past and future in different time
Must watch ."
2697,"I'll keep it brief. Overall I enjoyed the film. Definitely one to watch at the cinema. It is confusing and I definitely want to watch it again to see all the bits I missed. Some the dialogue was hard to understand in bits (no, not when they talk backwards ;)). If you can put your over analytical mind that needs to make sense of everything, sit back and enjoy the ride you'll probably enjoy it more."
2698,"The premise was a brilliant rethinking of a much covered SciFi trope. It was a spectacular exercise of the mind to unravel its mysteries. The filmmaking and sound track were innovatively executed. The only problem was I couldn't understand 50% of the dialogue, much of which was given through oxygen masks or under the noise of battle by an international cast with all the glory of their divergent English accents. In a film so rooted in complex intellectual constructs and subtle plot twists, it sure would have been nice to hear what they were saying. I'll look forward to seeing it again, for the first time, with subtitles. Although we were in a state of the art theatre, I discovered that one of the other four in the Auditorium was able to catch more of the dialogue from her seat at the elevated back of the hall. I think this film rates a 9 (superbly clever) out of 10, but I won't know until I see it again with subtitles. {SciFi Action Adventure}"
2699,"Absolutely mind blowing movie. He did it again!!! Definitely a must see for everyone who likes Inception like movies. This brings the inception dreams to the next level.Dear Mr. Nolan, can I have some pieces of that great stuff 😎 or just tell us where to find"
2700,Having seen in two days ago I'd say it's his best film he's made. I was in awe at its ambition and Nolan's ability pulling it off. It is horrendously complicated but strangely logical. Cannot wait to watch it multiple times so I can experience those a-ha moments with foresight (a very apt approach to the film).Whilst not as fantastical as Inception or emotional as Interstellar I found it bizarrely believable and the 'time-travel' rules and constraints all made sense.Lovely emotional explanation towards the end if you're ever asking yourself 'why'.
2701,"In terms of fan favourites and just raw talent in general, director Christopher Nolan has been one of the best in Hollywood for many years. Every time he is working on a new project people immediately get excited. Being one of those people myself, I was eagerly awaiting his latest film, Tenet. Now playing in theatres in select areas of the world, Tenet is probably Nolan's most complex film to date. Normally, the complexities of his stories are what intrigues everyone and eventually have them loving it upon multiple viewings, but I believe he nearly went too far with this one. Tenet is a great example of top-notch filmmaking, but it's a lot to take in at times. Here are my overall thoughts.To even attempt to describe this plot in detail will leave people scratching their heads, so I'll simply say that this film follows a globetrotting main character (who is nameless throughout the entire film) who works his way through plots of espionage, all while learning and adapting to the new ways this world works. Playing with the reverse of time in real-time, Tenet is a very heavy movie to take in. There are scenes of expository dialogue that had me incredibly invested and understanding everything Christopher Nolan was going for, but others where I had more questions than any of his films in the past. This was absolutely a detriment to my overall experience, especially upon first viewing, but it also makes up for that in many more ways than one.The sheer spectacle, cinematography, and in-camera effects are truly what makes this film soar to its highest heights. It really was a true marvel to see how certain action sequences were moving both forward and backward in time. I'm not even sure how they pulled off some of the scenes that they did. Although the complexities took me out of it a little, I was still blown away watching many of the scenes unfold. If only the movie as a whole was even slightly clearer, I might have said I loved it. That said, it's also the kind of movie that I can see myself loving in a year from now if many more viewings assist in my enjoyment.It goes without saying that a Christopher Nolan film will make you think very hard about what you're watching and at least be enjoyable to a fault. For that reason, I wasn't surprised at all that I liked this film. I was more looking at everything else in the film. From the very good central performance by John David Washington to the always welcome screen-characters by Robert Pattinson, this cast is littered with talent in front of the camera. It was also nice to see Nolan switch up his composer from Hans Zimmer to the likes of Ludwig Göransson. I thought his work here was very inspired and became a character in its own right as the film progressed.In the end, Tenet is a visual masterpiece that did leave a bit to be desired by the time it reached its conclusion. I was both blown away and puzzled throughout the majority of it, which is why I find it very hard to recommend. It's a very, very well-made film that I absolutely think filmgoers should seek out whenever they can, but be prepared to watch it more than once as well. This is a movie that requires a lot of your time and a lot of your attention in order to win you over. I'm very pleased with the final result, but also scratching my head a day later after watching it. Tenet is a great film that I'm still trying to grasp."
2702,"It's been a while since I saw a movie in theaters (last time was Sonic the Hedgehog), so it was a great time to see one in the big screen again. I am a huge fan of Christopher Nolan, and in my opinion, it didn't disappoint. Though I would say it is not his best movie (My favorites are The Dark Knight & Inception).I like the main concept in this movie, I love the visual effects and lot of it reminds me of Inception. I like the main character (played by John David Washington), though the rest of characters are rather okay. I think the plot is interesting, but I don't want to spoil anything, so I won't go into details here.The plot is interesting, but I think the movie is a little bit difficult to follow at times. So many things happens at once, and if you look away from the movie for a tiny second, you might miss a important plot point. The plot can be a little bit confusing, but I understood most of it. I think I should one day rewatch the movie to fully understand it.Despite the plot being confusing at times, I enjoyed the movie. It's not Nolan's best, but if you're looking for something similar to Inception, give this movie a watch. (Just don't have high expectations)"
2703,Cool movie! Almost as cool as inception. Amazing story but the music was not great and the last fight had a lot of flaws.
2704,"Nolan seems to get some ideas from Steins;Gate, which is an anime that also talks about alternative timelines and prevents future warfares."
2705,"Are you sure - you read my review at first time?;) How many timelines we have actually??
That movie made me to think about strange things.. Not bad at all!"
2706,Such a great movie really enjoyed it its my new favorite movie
2707,"If you couldn't wait to get back into the cinema, then this film will welcome you back with open arms. Big names, lots of guns and explosions, a preposterous plot and the requirement for an exceptional level of suspended disbelief all spell out 'Summer Blockbuster'. For 2020, this is it. If you cannot follow the dialogue, just look at the pictures.Great stuff!"
2708,"Writing this after a first viewing.I thought the time inversion concept and it's cinematic execution were mind boggling. It wrinkles your brain, in a way no other films do and that alone is quite impressive. John David Washington plays the protagonist brilliantly, it's rare to see an action hero with heart and charisma. He's the real human anchor of this film and really the only character the audience can relate to. Of course the cinematography and set pieces are impressive, though in this film they sometimes felt a bit forced. Like what was the point of that sailing scene other than to film something cool in the open ocean that was kind of reminiscent of Dunkirk?As for what's really disappointing thing about this film.... Nolan's movies usually deal with lofty, complicated concepts but he tries to ground them through human relationships. The theme of time is always connected to human themes like identity, loss, sacrifice and finding a purpose. Because of this, morality is muddled. In Nolan's previous films, there is no clear 'bad guy', he purposefully turns the concept on its head in Memento, The Prestige, and The Dark Knight, and in his other films the characters fight against circumstance not against an archetypal baddie.In Tenet, however, Branagh plays your typical Russian arms dealer wanting to destroy the world. He's ambitious, possessive and controlling and it's such a shame the film makes use of the most tired clichéd character type in the genre. His wife, played by Debicki, is cut from the same archetypal cloth. She's a victimised damsel whose only motivation is her son. So without all the time inversion stuff, in a nutshell, John David Washington is trying to save the world and save the girl from this horrible arms dealer. This is has been the plot of pretty much every Bond movie ever... yawn.This would be a far better film if it had focused on the relationship between the agents and how it's affected by time... we get a tiny taste of this at the end but it's not really explored that much. I would've loved to see more of Pattinson and Washington, since that pair clearly had more chemistry than Washington and Debicki. Priya was also a character they could've done more interesting things with, but instead she's Mme. Exposition. In short, there are a number of different ways Nolan could've given the film a bit more heart, more substance, but it seems he was much too occupied with executing the time inversion concept right, to really develop the characters and the story tying them together."
2709,"To explain the plot of this film any other way would take way too long, even if I did understand it all. That being said, this a great film with Director Christopher Nolan's signature all over it; a genre twisting story, an incredible score, next level practical effects and most of all... exposition fired in your face like a machine gun.From start to finish you'll be caught up in a world that you kind of recognise but may struggle to understand giving you a feeling of unease as you try to decipher the torrent of dialogue and that's before we even start talking about the use of 'Time Inversion' and 'Entropy'.There's a lot to process and just when you think you're grasping something BANG a whole new plot device or random character is introduced. What this film does expertly is reward those who are willing to pay attention. If you can put in the effort, follow along and learn the rules (and maybe have a degree in physics), you'll be gifted with a mind-altering experience.In true Nolan style there's plenty of 'Score', replacing his go to composer Hans Zimmer with the equally outstanding Ludwig Göransson, although coupled with the thumping sound design can make the already tricky dialogue hard to hear.Another of the Directors favourites did make the cut Michael Caine but only in a cameo. Relative newcomer John David Washington is great, however he did occasionally look like he was trying to understand the script (I don't blame him). The rest of the cast were good, Robert Pattinson brought a surprising endearing quality but I found it hard to warm to Elizabeth Debicki.Despite this being a very complex movie, I thoroughly enjoyed it, walking out of the cinema wanting to pull apart and piece back together so many elements of the story and its execution. I recommend watching it at the cinema, take your mates so you can spend hours dissecting it afterwards.In Aussie cinemas August 27"
2710,"Its hard to say much without giving away key plot points (dont worry, no spoilers), but Tenet is a great movie that is perhaps too smart for the average moviegoer. The story deals with personal struggles, friendships, beginnings and endings, all set against the hypotheticals of time play. It's kind of like a crazy, beautiful dance that you wish you could do with someone you love. It's a real good movie.To be fair, it probably needs to be watched at least twice. But as is said: real art requires you to look at it again. This isnt the time-travel story of Avengers Endgame, though it may be a commentary on the state of movie going today when a movie like that breaks the box office and and a movie like Tenet is complained about for being to complex and having no heart. And perhaps that can be your gauge; if you thought Endgame was amazing, then maybe stay away from this one. But if Endgame drove you nuts with all the silliness, then perhaps this one is up your alley. It definitely demands your attention, and even so, it's almost impossible to get everything. In the end, though, it's worth it.One note, however; the sound is so loud it was difficult to discern what were explosions, what were gunshots, and what was musical score. I highly suggest a person be prepared to ask their theater to turn down the volume, or wear some ear covers to dampen the sound and make it more discernible. I held my hands over my ears a few times and it really helped when I did.This is not a ""check your brain at the door"" movie. Its a smart AND clever film that takes a careful eye & ear, and wraps a bit of soul into its machinations."
2711,Watch it in IMAX BLURAY + SUBTITLES + ENJOY THE MINDBENDING RIDE.
2712,You need to watch twice. We are not capable to understand full movie in just one time. This is intellectual movie. Watch it with full mind on it.
2713,"The expectations of the movie have gone too high butub this movie did satisfy me
Em yfsitas did eivom siht"
2714,"Tenet builds up in its first-third and can get frustrating if you try to ""understand it and not feel it"". But once the spectacle begins, it will leave you breathless with its sheer brilliance.
I don't agree with people criticizing it's complexity because you have to make a patient effort to understand the plot and Nolan's ingenuity to appreciate this masterpiece."
2715,"How does one make a film no can easily spoil? Well, possibly by convoluting the plot, but it's something only original filmmakers can do. Tenet by Christopher Nolan is just that film. He successfully repeats the sci-fi action formula used in Inception (of mixing blockbuster action with a thought-inducing plot) and emerges successful in delivering the desired product, though the rather intended convolution can be indeed distracting.But as a character said: ""Don't try to understand it. Feel it."" That's what I did. Try to think of it and I guess not even all the characters are possibly understanding what's going on around them, except it deals with time and involves plenty of physical challenges. With that, I found myself stopping to question everything I was watching and rather just get immersed into it. The nonstop action, which was also very well filmed and choreographed like any other Nolan actioner, is the real highlight and one of the reasons the convoluted plot doesn't turn out to be a negative.Since it worked for me that way, you can say Nolan made a right choice with the genre. By keeping it a pure action blockbuster at its core, he has prevented the film from possibly losing viewers to the at-times confusion inducing plot. One thing I can guarantee is that a single viewing isn't going to clear all your doubts. And that's both an intelligent commercial formula as well as an original, intriguing tactic on part of the makers.It has got great performances too, and you possibly know that already. Although the film is long, the focused plot and the constant action and suspense end up justifying it in the end. The score is good, even though it ends up making a good amount of the dialogue inaudible without subtitles. I watched it with subtitles, and still found the exposition hard to follow. But as mentioned before, the action worked big time. Not only because it was beautifully constructed, but also because of how it was placed: just at the time when you're starting to think too much.Tenet isn't a difficult film to enjoy, just a difficult one when the plot is pieced together. But with that, you get two choices once the credits have rolled: to re-watch it or just read explanations on the internet. Since this is an action film, I've got a good reason to re-watch it (although my primary choice would be to just watch the reverse action sequences), but I also can't deny the fact that one of the best things about the film was not understanding everything, just like we don't understand time in general. The makers, in my opinion, have now a good opportunity to also release a linear cut for people to follow it better (although I don't see it happening anytime soon).Just try to enjoy Tenet without trying to think too much (I know it'll be difficult, but still) while the film is still playing. The explosive action sequences are there to help you with it. Once it's over, go ahead and make any of the aforementioned choices: doing that alone will decide how better you understand TENET, a word that remains the same when spelled backwards."
2716,"Tenet is what you get when creativity is at its peak. In an era of reboots and unwanted sequels, Tenet is something which is original, unique and much more ahead of its time. It is that type of movie which will get better and better when you watch it over and over again. Don't criticise it before you understand the depths of it. In five to ten years from now, it will be looked as a classic."
2717,I love this movie nothing to add nothing to subtract it's just perfect
2718,"I don't know what to say.I love the concept of this, it's exactly what I rarely get treated to by Knowlen, but the struggle to hear the dialogue in a variety of fast cut accents, coupled with the inorganic pacing in normal human conversation makes it a masterpiece ruined in the editing suite.With this being the latest in a line of his abysmal control over the vocal track, and an unwillingness to persevere any more, I'm reluctantly looking for a new hero."
2719,"The dialogue is more obvious on the 2nd viewing to the extent that you can't miss it.No spoilers, watch it again."
2720,"Nolan's Magic bouncing here once again..
Ironic and most complexed screenplay.. Better to watch twice!!"
2721,"Amazing Sci-fi plot with amazing direction without missing any tiny details relative to the plot. Watching it just one time without repeating any scene, and try to understand the plot is impossible! According to me, it's Nolan's best work so far"
2722,"This is my first ever review here. This movie is a masterpiece. Mr. Nolan, you have done it again.
After Inception and Interstellar I was hoping that this one is going to play with my mind but oh boy, the devilishly genius Nolan put craziness with insanity and reverse it back to make me feel like I was some lunatic with weak eyesight.This is the first film in a long time I am going to watch it dozens of times. Because the first time I had to concentrate a lot to understand it.It's a very good movie, ah, it's just more than good, it's a fabulous movie. Tenet is a class on its own.
I like complex and mind blending movies but Tenet takes it to a whole new level.
The story is just really great but the back story of the Protagonist is not discussed properly. I think that is for the future sequels or maybe for prequels.Anyway, I found it interesting, and very entertaining, the whole time I was on the edge of my seat.
The acting of Washington and Pattinson is awesome in this movie, I would like to say i like Pattinson more.
Do not give it bad reviews just because you did not understand the most entertaining film of 2020.
If you do not have the passion for stories and the ability to concentrate then it's not the director's fault.
I wish i can give it more than 10 stars."
2723,"Any critic of this film and its plot proves what Mel brookes said.
""First born came the artist, naturally second comes the afterbirth. The critic."
2724,"Disclaimer - this review is based off the 4K Imax Laser Presentation of the film.After many months, many days wondering if I would ever get to see the film the way in which Christopher Nolan intended to be seen and much thought as to whether or not the film could possibly live up to expectations and save cinema along the way, I have finally seen the famed directors latest mind-bending offering that may've struggled to reach the heights of his previous films in a very different landscape but still manages to be an often jaw-dropping thrill ride that is exactly the type of offering we need at this present time.Soon coming to home release, Tenet is the type of film that deserves to be watched on the biggest screen available to your viewing needs with Nolan embedding his take on the James Bond style action/thriller with ample set pieces, sci-fi oddities and a musical score that will likely have your ears ringing from the moment the films explosive first scene begins.Shrouded in much mystery before release, Tenet's plot points and movements have started to seep their way into everyday conversations but if possible, avoiding these analysis's and spoiler-filled discussions will ensure the film is going to provide you with much entertainment as John David Washington's Protagonist gets caught up in a dangerous mission that will either doom the world should he fail or save it should he manage to get his head around a time-inverting scenario that you shouldn't even pretend to understand on first viewing.It's almost impossible to talk about any further details of Tenet's plot without giving too much away but suffice to say the staples of Nolan's filmography are readily on show throughout with carefully staged destruction, heists, messing of time itself and a disdain for character development or emotional development all found within his latest piece of original Hollywood goodness.It's rare to watch such a high-profile release in the modern era where you never feel comfortable with understanding or predicting where things are or where they may be heading, it may even be off-putting for some viewers who might find themselves frustrated by the films lack of explanation (perfectly summed up by its without context opening set-piece) or rushed delivery of important bits of information but by the time everything ends and you ponder what has come before, you realize Nolan gave you enough to satisfy your questions without giving it all away, something that is likely to be chipped away at as viewers return for multiple viewings in the future.Rollicking along at a pace that would make most films embarrassed, there's barely a dull moment found throughout this eye-popping escapade with Washington and MVP Robert Pattinson on peak charismatic form and Nolan just begging you to come along for the ride, Tenet may not be peak Nolan but its blockbuster filmmaking at its most playful, exciting and original.Final Say -With issues to be found no doubt with plot coherence, audio mixes and a lack of human connection, Tenet can still be enjoyed as a break-neck piece of big budget movie making that provides an endless rush of thrills and spills all centered around a deeply trippy plot that will be explored for years yet to come.4 cheese graters out of 5"
2725,"A very typical Nolan film - well-executed, complicated, plot-driven, emotionally vacuous, and philosophically shallow intellectual puzzle that is thought-provoking only insofar as it functions as an elaborate thought experiment.Once the twist is revealed, and the puzzle is solved, it loses most of its relevance. Despite its sophistication, it has nothing really interesting to say about our existential, cultural, or political conditions. But because of its complicated plot and high concept, a lot can be said about it that will make one sound smart.Like many other Nolan films, it takes a set of interesting premises about time, technology, consciousness, and physics, and, instead of questioning or subverting them, runs with it and constructs an elaborate story out of it.For what it is, it's exhilarating and entertaining, and not a bad theatre experience after many months of quarantine."
2726,"Way too long and confusing. What was Christopher Nolan thinking? My date fell asleep halfway through. Plus I think they hyped the movie a little too much. Fellas if you want your date to have little interest in you take her to see this film. Ladies if you want a nap during date night, watch this film with your man. The movie is about 2 hours and 30 mins. Only time you won't be confused during the movie is the ending credits. Do I recommend this film? Sure if you're a Christopher Nolan fan. If not, this is an easy pass."
2727,"Tenet isn't something you would expect downright from Nolan's ideas backpack. The idea of inversion might've led this movie to so-called success, since it missed a lot of Nolan's best motion-picture practices; human relation, hopelessness, action thriller instances, suspense, etc.All in all, people who didn't liked the movie like I didn't might fool you with passing on non-intellectual racist comments like your mind couldn't grasp Nolan's story lol. Let's be for one good God sake serious guys, this wasn't something the majority we expected from Nolan. The praises watchers of Tenet giving to Nolan are because of his best blockbuster movie glories like Inception and Interstellar."
2728,I will watch the movie for a second time and I hope I'm going to find the masterpiece.
2729,"Every vision should have its limits. There is the future in the past. Yes, it is an original piece, without a doubt. The driving element this time is time and its rewinding a vice versa. While in the first half we step mostly linearly forward, in the second half it all breaks and something innovative comes along, at some point it just dulls the viewer in wondering if he really understood what he saw or heard from the saviors of the World."
2730,"As much as I love this movie, lots of the criticism is true. The first half is a slog to get through. Tenet takes 40 long minutes to establish things that Nolan's own Inception managed to convey within 10 minutes of starting. You never get invested in any character beyond a surface level. The audio is garbage and the dialogue is all whispered. Secondary characters come and go without purpose. It's a complete mess.But if you can suffer through that first half, you won't be able to stop. The first ""inverted"" fight is absolutely mind-blowing, and it only gets better from there. It's honestly hard to find the words to describe it. Not cool or awesome. It was creepy. Alien. Unsettling. Terrifying. And this feeling NEVER goes away. You never adjust to time-inversion, you never fully accept it because your brain simply can't handle it. Right up until the last few minutes, Nolan keeps digging into this concept and serving up new ideas for us to chew on.In short, this is basically a bunch of high-concept action scenes wrapped up in 2.5 grueling hours of Bond-lite cliches. For a regular movie I would give this a 7, and so that's what I put. However, for a Nolan movie, it's more like a 5, because he's already proven he is capable of so much more than flashy visuals. All that said, this movie is truly a unique concept, which is rare these days. I can guarantee that you have never seen ANYTHING like the action in this movie, so definitely check it out for yourself.Let me put it this way. You might be disappointed, but you won't regret it."
2731,"< That said, no one expects Nolan's film would be a fertile playground for first-grade acting chops (the late Heather Ledger is a flash in the pan), but even the pageantry here does not cut it for Nolan's standard, the mocked final battlefield sequences are too frantically edited that one can not discern which team is ""red"" and which is ""blue"", not to mention to trace the whole shebang of the so-called ""temporal pincer movement"" into which so many pains and efforts are poured. >read full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks"
2732,"It begins with stunning scene but the longer the plot is weaken. Don't get me wrong, it's super entertaining movie. In the end I have to cover my head with confusion about characters in this film. I don't know the background or anything about them.I lost track of human feel. I don't understand what they are talking about. The cinematography still rocks me though. I try to watch it as high quality art film."
2733,"Classy like James Bond
Hectic like Mission Impossible
Apocalyptic like Terminator
Intricate like DarkIf you loved those movies, then you'll love Tenet.
Tenet is the perfect balance of action, espionage and sci-fi, powerfully supported by a majestic soundtrack.
Ok, you might feel confused in the last part, or something might not sum up, but just remember that the ""willing suspension of disbelief"" is necessary for the full enjoyment of every sci-fi movie.
By now, I'd give it a 9/10. Anyway I'll watch it again to give a more sober judgement in the future."
2734,"A definite must-watch that will leave you scratching your head just enough for it to be enjoyable. A thought-provoking, fast-paced masterpiece with incredible acting. Washington shone more brightly than anyone else as the lead, alongside amazing performances from Pattinson, Debicki, and Branagh. Michael Caine returns once again, lighting up the screen with his wit and charm. As a Nolan fan, I was far from disappointed. What an astonishing movie."
2735,"Probably a great film to watch at home, but truly extraordinary to watch It in the cinema."
2736,"I don't believe that someone can fully understand the movie at the first watch the plot of movie is too rush and the background of the movie isn't understandable at all Apart from the difficult setting of the movie it is still a movie that worth watching, the sound and special effects still maintain at a high level the entertaining of the movie itself is adequate as well."
2737,"The year is 2020. Coronavirus has taken over. Lockdowns and quarantines have been imposed worldwide. Masks are essential. Cinemas have been closed for months, and - for many - TENET marks the big blockbuster which signals the opening of cinemas again in many countries, and perhaps a return to some sort of (new) normal.I believe many moviegoers will, like myself, enter the cinema feeling so excited and yearning a new Nolan movie, and will leave feeling rather deflated and disappointed.I went to the cinema to see this with a friend today (in IMAX), and both he and I (not to toot our own horns) would like to believe we are (at least mildly) intelligent. We are cinephiles and thoroughly enjoy our cinema visits, and are careful in which movies we select to see on the big screen.Unfortunately, given the utter perplexion this movie bestows upon its audience, this leads to a displeasing dichotomy: either we are not as intelligent as we thought, or this movie isn't as well-written as Nolan's other movies. Both conclusions are equally terrifying to us (nerds).About just over an hour after the movie begins is when things start to dissolve. At this point, I began thinking: ""Gosh, I wish I could start the movie over again, but with subtitles on this time."" And I felt that way for the entire rest of the film. There's many moments where I had to turn to my friend and mouth the words: ""What did (s)he just say?"", only to be met with repeated shrugs. The movie is 2.5 hours long, yet everything is incredibly fast-paced (to the point it has poor pacing); if you blink, you'll likely miss something very important.Maybe it's my fault - maybe I briefly, for a few critical moments, let my attention slip, and therefore I'm to blame for my own confusion. Maybe this is another Nolan instant-classic, but unfortunately I'm not sure that's the case (for context, many didn't like Dunkirk for a number of reasons - I loved it, for many other reasons). I'd love to get into detail as to some of the specifics which truly baffled me in the second half of the film, but as I want this to remain a spoiler-free review, I won't delve in.And, for the avoidance of doubt: the action set-pieces, the soundtrack, and the cinematography were all phenomenal. Just not really too sure the plot was quite up to standard, or necessarily well-executed. It was almost like a bad Bond movie, with a sup-par villain and a random Bond girl we're supposed to care about, but don't because... well, we just don't, and I think the script/dialogue is largely to blame for these characters we feel apathy towards.I do hope if you're reading this and you do decide to go see it, that you understand it better than I did. I will rewatch it at some point, but I certainly won't be paying to see it a second time in the cinema! I'd rather not pay good money to be put in a bad mood. If I wanted that, I'd go do some mathematical equations.And finally, for those saying this is a movie you have to go see twice - I don't doubt that that's true. But I don't think it's fair to expect an audience to be disappointed in a movie and only appreciate it on second viewing. Inception, Memento and Interstellar were clever films too, but you were able to follow them and didn't need to see them twice to enjoy them."
2738,"Great action movie - very Bond-like, but being Christopher Nolan, there's a lot more to it. Perhaps not so engaging as Inception, but full-on entertainment, and a little challenging on the brain cells. Glad I took my headphones- it's one very noisy movie. A visual delight, and an excellent cast. Two or three good surprises during the last third..."
2739,"This movie has everything you expect from Nolan: crazy storyline, good action, incredible effects, beautiful cinematography. Stay focused and enjoy the movie!"
2740,"Time management by the Time Master Nolan. Did I just see this movie, or I haven't seen it yet?
At least I hear mystical sounds looping in my head..."
2741,"What a weird experience this movie is. Breathtaking action and huge setpieces mix with huge exposition dumps and quite confusing mechanics. After about an hour things start to make more sense and I got really into it. I'm quite sure I haven't fully understood this film, just barely enough to have fun. It's challenging, but rewarding. It's weirdly poetic with it's sort of palindrome construction. I'm sure that after future viewings my understanding, and rating, of ""Tenet"" will increase. Time will tell if it's layered or just convoluted. But it's Christopher Nolan, what else do you expect? Technically brilliant (albeit editing and scene geography could've been better in several scenes), well acted, innovative and unapologetically Bondian (Bondish?).
Christopher Nolan is a unique voice in today's cinema and I'm grateful that he's not afraid to take chances."
2742,"Some of all of your favorites from the past coincide into one brilliant piece of art. If you liked The Matrix, Strange Days, or Memento this is one for you."
2743,"Much mystery and anticipation led up to the release of Christopher Nolans new thriller, and it definitely did not disappoint. I can't say it exceeded expectations, since basically everything Nolan touches becomes art, and this is not an exception.Directors of these kinds of movies likes to play around with chronology, and this one takes it one step further, making things that happen simultanious, and yet out of order - it feels more in tune with Inception, Memento and The Prestige than The Dark Knight or Dunkirk.The special effects are fantastic and complements the narrative in effective ways, and so does the characters and the actors portraying them, one character stands out as one you may hate a lot.The plot was a mystery before release, and frankly, still is. It is not a straightforward tale, so it does not work for everyone, much like Nolan's other works, it requires thinking an analyzing to be appreciated, and if you give it just that, you can't help but love it.Hopefully this will end up on IMDb's Top 250 list after more have rated it!"
2744,"First off wow!.... I literally have to pause myself to describe into words of how incredible and amazing this piece of artwork of a film was by Christopher Nolan...Also if you see a bad review about this movie which I've already started to see not on IMDB, absolutely forget it and them. They don't have shed of intelligence or a slight understanding or comprehension of what this movie was about.Next off, I'm placing this movie into a category of best movies of this decade so far. Absolutely loved it to pieces. I had been waiting all week since I booked my advance screening tickets to it and had been waiting alllll these years since the filming went into production with Nolans name at the helm. It was insanely better than what I thought in my mind of what it could be about when the first trailer popped up.It was a shame to not see Hans Zimmer on the production credits for music score, but the score was definitely well done and probably a tributary tracking in certain scenes towards Zimmer by Ludwig. Really loved it. Especially the action scenes enveloping these beautiful melodies. I very much felt like Zimmer would be happy with a score like this.The movies main concept and idea is just absolutely incredible. Nolan hit it completely out of the gates on this one like he always does. It's like one of those movies where you go ""Wow no one hasn't particularly used this type of cinematography or storyline based around time travel"". Same with Inceptions core of understanding with dreams and how he filmed that movie with a whole new concept and idea. I'd say this movie was very much like Inception, but in a Time diverse way if that makes sense.I won't give away too much details around the main concept as that would spoil major key details that weren't shown in the trailers. But I have to say the opening scene was absolutely insane, like the Joker scenes at the bank heist opening scenes insane. Really well thought out, especially when the end credits roll and you totally suck the whole scope and understanding of the movie up into your mind from the very first scenes like ""Omg wow! that's why that happened"". Like you're totally trying to work it all out, but it becomes absolutely clear in the end.I am definitely going to see this movie a hundred more times, especially when it comes to Blu-ray release. Just to pick up more of the hidden easter eggs going on in the background when you're focused on some scenes. It would have been absolutely insane filming that ending via the use of scene tiles in pre production. I am guessing that department must have been a nightmare to shoot with Nolan choreographing thousands of graphic picture tiles up on the board, linking up both stories of the movie. I cannot wait to hit play on the behind the scenes when I get the Blu-ray release.Who ever was the theoretical physicist on this film working with Nolan. Which I am guessing is Kip Thorne, going by his work on Interstellars script. And definitely his knowledge on Entropy and Time dilation physics. My hat is off to you my good Sir. You smashed the physics out of the ball park with Nolans creativity concept of a storyline to go with it. Absolutely incredible.I hate saying this, but I have to say this is Nolans best work he's ever done to date. Like I absolutely loved Inception and Interstellar to pieces but the script of this movie is just hands down incredible and creativity towards it, developing this idea of time travel flow takes the top position over Interstellar and Inception. Especially by the use of CGI and filming. Hard to say this, but because Zimmer wasn't involved. It's kind of easy to understand that I can say this in my mind. The last Christopher Nolan film that had me smiling the whole entire time was Interstellar, but this one had me doing the same exact thing. It's just a masterpiece.This film when it finally releases all around the world and everyone has seen it, will be definitely talking about it. Especially the ending. I was like ""This was absolutely beautifully interwoven from the get go"".Also before I end this review. I have to give credit to Robert Pattison. He played a really different roll to what he normally plays and can definitely see him as Batman coming out of this movie. I have a feeling he might do actually well with that. I also liked Denzel Washingtons son John David Washington from Ballers in this too."
2745,The movie is great. Watch is multiple times. You will understand more and more every time you watch it.
2746,"First of all, did I enjoy this movie from Christopher Nolan? Was I entertained for the entire duration which was quite long? On both questions I have to answer yes. Now I don't concider myself as dumb, but I'm not a genius either, but this movie is so hard to follow, almost at the point you pain your brain trying to figure out what's going on. I'm happy I'm not the only one that didn't understand much of the complexity of the story. Like some other reviewers stated it's probably better to watch it a second time to fully, or at least partially understand, but I'm not going to do that. Tenet is just one of those movies that need your full constant attention, very difficult to understand but that isn't bad for the matter. The cinematography is great, with excellent action scenes, and a cast that did a very good job. John David Washington and Robert Pattinson, the two main characters are pleasant to watch. In conclusion, I'm surprised I liked this movie as I didn't get it all, but I'm not sure it will please everybody, certainly not the picky viewers."
2747,"If I make a list of all the questions I have after seeing the movie without even blinking an eye, it's a list of probably 50 questions. Then if I go back and watch it the second time, half of the questions on the list are likely answered.The remaining unanswered questions from a numerous rewatch are likely due to the whole topic being unreal or absolutely has no correlation with modern day science. So, this part you'll have to interpret your own, make up your own believable plot to suit the entire story in order to connect the missing dots.I can't wait to see what Nolan says about this."
2748,"Amazing movies.... Must watch, best direction and screenplay and excellent performance by J.D Washington.."
2749,"There are no words to describe how amazing this movie is. Everything is structured so well, the story is amazing, the audio and visuals as always on point, and the casting executes their characters so well. Time and time again (no pun intended), Nolan has been showing us how to turn a great idea into reality. Leave it to the man to overshadow everything typical and predictable thats wrong in cinema nowadays. Tenet will surely keep you on the edge of your seat and you blink at the cost of missing out important details within the movie. It's understandable if an average viewer doesn't understand everything that's going on through their first sitting as I believe this masterpiece requires pretty much advanced understanding and attention as to what's going on. Watch it one, two or more times if you don't understand it. Those who put up bad reviews about this clearly misunderstood what's going on and don't know what they are writing about, and I can't blame them for their low IQ. Outstanding. We surely live in a twilight world."
2750,This is definitely a fun to watch movie. You will need a brain that functions at at least 40% to get what is happening otherwise you'd give this a 2 star. I can't wait for the sequel.
2751,"All in all this wasn't that great. The storyline was too confusing at times, the main actor wasn't that convincing and it really didn't have to be this long.It did like the Andrei Sator guy a lot, he was a great villian."
2752,I recently watched an oriental film without subtitles. Had very difficult time understanding any words because of it. That's what Tenet reminded me of. Practically need subtitles to understand anything. Very difficult to follow.
2753,"I am at once entertained and confounded by Nolan's latest escapade. At its heart, Tenet is an ambitious retelling of the old time travel thriller genre, however it feels convoluted and seems to be deliberately confusing upon first viewing.After reading an online story beats and some fan theories, while combining them with my own, I've decided to stick with my original rating of 6.5 and perhaps in time it will change.The movie was shot with sophistication and style, but there are too many plot contrivances with narrative bogged down by the weight of its own logic and inability to be coherent.The sound and dialogue seem to be designed to make it hard for viewers to understand and thus enjoy the story arcs and its conclusion. Characters were talking with heavy accents, behind masks and exposition upon exposition that were dominated by the background music or sound effects.And like Nolan's recent movies, Tenet is almost bereft of emotion, where he seems to delight in the technicality of his sci-fi world more than telling a good story. There are drama and violence for sure but they were delivered with such cold precision and calculated structure that the amazing action pieces actually takes away from the story's cohesiveness.And by the time you reach the final act, either you are on board and are in awe with Nolan's masterpiece or totally dumb founded and feel the entire movie is one good looking mess that works only in his mind.Nolan makes incredible and thought-provoking movies but for me, his last truly great movie was Inception. And I feel that it has been a steady decline in storytelling quality and an increase of cold logic/technicality.In essence, Tenet is a revisit of Memento but on steroid. The muscles have taken over the healthy man within."
2754,"I think CN is a genius for creating a movie that is so confusing that you have to see it in theatres twice. I think that this movie is to sleek and cool for its good, the main characters literal is a secret government code-name and he is only referred to as, the protagonist. The sound mixing is so comically bad that despite what Christopher Nolan says, I would recommend watch this at home when it comes on digital so you can watch with subtitle instead of the booming audio in the. (Probably COVID full) theatres that CN keeps saying for you to see it in. The action probably is the saving grace, it is so great to look at and how complex and sleek it is."
2755,"While I absolutely love the movie for the always amazing Christopher Nolan cinematography and visuals (really amazing how this movie worked with 'so little' CGI, the plot is just.. lackluster. Sure, there's a story going on the whole time, and it's pretty cohesive, but there's no motivation for the audience to sympathize with anyone by the end of the movie. It's like Good Guy/Bad Guy but without anything else. Great move, but just a bit disappointing."
2756,"A Christopher Nolan slugfest on both sides.Tenet felt like a better James Bond movie, thrown in some of Nolan's mind-boggling concepts, which had its ups and downs through its 2.5 hours way.It has a unique main concept, which elaborates slow enough to keep the audience's attention, but then is rushed at the end to give you homework to do if you have the desire to untie it. It may mean a rewatch, or a watching explanation videos, suiting your own interest.My biggest problem was that I did not feel invested in the story at all. I think this was due to the mistake of the film that even though it is 2.5 hours long, it gives us very little character background, or development. Acting felt OK, with a surprisingly good performance of Robert Pattinson for me. However, most of the character background was spent of the antagonist (glad they did not call him that way...) and his wife, it could not get me invested.I feel like a rewatch could might increase its value, and understanding the punchline concept fully might have worth it, but the frigid storytelling and some logical errors make me unsure if I have 2.5 hours of my life to give it again."
2757,"This is by far the most amazing movie I've ever watched in my life! The concept is out of this world, the music design is intense and the story is complex yet unbelievably amazing! Christopher Nolan is a god-level writer-director! Kudos to him!!!"
2758,"I can see how difficult it is for Nolan to imagine what watching Tenet is like for the viewer. It's hard to listen to because the dialog has no clarity either sonically or in explanation. It's hard to follow because things that are happening in the film simultaneously are more visually and sequentially complex than we expect to process at any one time. These things seem of no consequence to Nolan because he has not made a movie based on how you would normally make a movie, a movie that has a plot and moves forwards and reveals itself. Nolan is pre-occupied, rather like an astronaut rapidly leaving Earth's atmosphere and too busy entering space to concern himself with us terrestrial beings. Too busy transcending movie making into a newer art form that manages the density and complexity of his evolved storytelling. Nolan is perfecting how film itself can manage stories in new ways.This I imagine, is why the movie on first watch is un-interpretable. It's not been designed to be seen as we currently view movies. Upon realising this at some point during the movie, I gave up trying to comprehend it in full and just started watching it as a display of events. And what Nolan has achieved in film is by using the properties of film in itself. Its ability to run backwards. Watching Tenet is like watching a movie play out in real time, but with another movie with the same plot that has been filmed backwards, then with both movies spliced together. We are literally watching two versions of a story going in opposite directions because the medium of film can literally do that, even if the result over-taxes on your ability to comprehend it in a single take.And this is the genius of Tenet. Film can be made backwards and forwards in the same way we can watch it again and again, backwards and forwards. The storyline and plot allow this to occur and our main enjoyment of this movie is that this can occur. There is in the story a homage to The Spierig Brothers' Predestination, where a model of time plays out to display the full consequences that time can have on our lives when time is no longer linear. But make no mistake, this movies plot is just a vehicle for Nolan to re-configure how the making and playing of movies itself can be changed. Moviemaking at its finest."
2759,"Tbh i went in skeptical i wouldn't love this film and by the first hour it looked like that was the case.The last one hour is where the movie really took off for me ((the moment when John David's character is captured and taken to the red chamber)) and it was a blast watching every moment unravel and i could kind of put the pieces together. The whole reverse entropy and time inversion concept was really fun, if you get to understand it even in the slightest. Sad to say i still don't know what the plot is about except for Debicki's role in the movie but i'm sure i'll get the gist of it after a couple of more watches. Ludwig Göransson score doesn't disappoint as always and i think Hans Zimmer put in a word for him to Nolan. This movie is meant to be watched at least twice so don't feel demotivated if you cant even get to grasp what is going on after 2 watches"
2760,"Nolan fanatics like myself expected a masterpiece from this film. However, it did not quite live up to that potential. There were times when it felt like a rehash of Inception, and other times when it felt like a ripoff of James Bond. Although, homage is not necessarily a weakness in the art of filmmaking. Nolan's high concept scope was alive and well in this entry. The amount of work that must have went into writing and editing had to have been one of the most ambitious endeavors in the history of original film, and it for the most part succeeded with a bang.Considering Nolan's penchant for practical effects, there were moments when one might think, ""how in the world did he just pull that off?"" The actors held themselves incredibly well for such a complicated and bonkers script, and the relatively predictable twists and stock character archetypes did not take away from the intellect of the concept. Espionage films have had a long standing history in cinema. Nolan is not only a practitioner of them, he is a fan. He sought out to make an original contribution to serve as a love letter, just as much as it was to serve as a thinking piece. He certainly succeeded. Was it a perfect movie? No, but in regard to its overall strengths, it was nothing short of spectacular."
2761,"For me this is one of Nolan's worst movies
We all know that he is creative, and he always try to do something new
But i think he went too far this time, the idea was unbelievably complicatedBtw, I loved the music which it was surprising for me since Hans Zimmer was not the one doing it
Action scenes were good, directing as always was great."
2762,"The pure innovation and ambition, like inception, is what makes this a true defining moment in film and storytelling in general. Do not get overly bogged down by the science like we are told many times, merely suspend your disbelief and engage fully with this palindromic story. Like all the best movies that have been made this is likely to polarise, but know that if you come out of the cinema knowing what this film truly is and loving it for its endeavour, then you will have reached the centre of your own movie watching palindrome and until the next time Nolan makes a movie, everything else is likely to appear inverted."
2763,"This movie is really a masterpiece. It can be pretty intense to processes when viewing. Lots of things happen.
If you like Nolan, you will like this movie."
2764,"Well the name of the movie can give you a glance it's named"" Tenet"" and if you spell it backwards it will be ""Tenet"" too! For instance the entire movie is based on such simple but brilliant idea which is traveling in time like going from ""tenet"" to ""tenet"" may sound confusing , right? Ok that's why this movie is a masterpiece.Actors had very solid performance and the story is mind blowing with many details to focus on.I watched the movie in imax and I can say quite simply this movie is another masterpiece directed by Christopher Nolan...the cinematography and effects are extremely astonishing...highly recommended movie!"
2765,"Loved every second. What a mind boggling action packed gem! Will have to see it again. Robert Pattinson is amazing. Elizabeth Debicki shines. The Protagonist is great and even Kenneth Brannagh is very good. And I usually am just annoyed by his presence. No spoilers here, but be sure to see this on a big screen with good sound. Maybe go watch it yesterday."
2766,"Scene translations were so fast and the script was not processed then i expected. There is not enough information about tenet. The audience has many questions about scenario. Who was the man saved in opera? What was the purpose? What was the purpose of the operation with the red and blue team and who were they shootout there? There was too much action to understant plans or relations. We know that Nolan love mistery but i think these are annoying knowlange deficiency for us.
Scenes was too short to understand and feel the emotion. When they talking the scene suddenly interupting and than an other scene. It was tiring and hard to adapt.
The music was so loud that we couldn't hear the surrounding sounds. Sometimes we can't even hear gunfires.
But the double scenes was well thought of. And some details were very wisely.
I hope we will be able to understand the relations and scenario in second film. I always have high expectations for Nolan."
2767,"It's not easy to explain the greatness of Nolan.
Don't expect less than the best Nolan so far.Simply...Beyond mindblowing !"
2768,"KUDOS to Nolan and the cast and the effects team. This movie has everything you can expect from a Nolan Movie, if you are watching this movie from a neutral point of view you'll need to watch it again or refer to YouTube videos to understand it completely. But how it lives up to expectation of leaving you satisfied and confused at same time is something what Movies are for. If you are not satisfied with plot or the ending, Go watch a RomCom because that is much simpler 90 mins with stereotypical plot."
2769,"I understand and like the premise of the plot. The acting was ok, but the sound was awful! Couldn't hear what anybody was saying. Based on other reviews I realize now that it was not the theater."
2770,"I was really confused at first when I watched the movie since it was way too complicated. In the end it made more sense but I was and still am left with a lot of questions. Overall, I liked the movie and maybe I will understand the movie better if I watch it again. However, I prefer Nolan's other movies, like Inception, over Tenet."
2771,"If you watch this movie without subtitles in a language that you understand, you will feel dumber than absolutely necessary. The audio is atrocious; lots of mumbling.
Also, don't expect even a modicum of humor! Or, a relatable character. They are all stereotyped. Check your rational brain and critical thinking to enjoy this bumpy ride."
2772,"Great sound, music, visuals and provably idea but found it pretty uninteresting and boring."
2773,"Every time I watch a film directed by Christopher Nolan I keep asking myself ""how much further should I drive my mind ??"" . The movie forces you to stay focus in order to keep up with the storyline !! So watch it carefully , you might need a second even a third time to understand it completely . Enjoy😉"
2774,Where do I even begin to describe this movie with out giving away spoilers. This movies is for people who love his other movies like Inception and Interstellar that will get you think heavily and require many viewings to understand it fully. Also more viewings will help you notice the little hints through out the movie. The acting is amazing with Washington and Pattinson both being incredible with great chemistry. Pattinson will make a great Batman after this. Action in the movie is of course incredible with time being used extremely cleverly during these fight scenes. My only issues with the film are with the characters you do not know much about any of them and some of the music is so loud it can be hard to hear conversations.This is a film that you do not want miss at the theater. The visuals and action scenes are worth seeing on the biggest screen possible. Go see it!
2775,"I'll try and keep this brief. ""Tenet"" is Christopher Nolan's latest film, and this time around he introduces audiences to a reinvention of the spy genre. I will admit there are a few times in the movie that are confusing, and that's only because there's a lot happening. I would say upon your first viewing try not to think too hard about the films explanation, but try and focus on the experience for what it is. Then later you can go back and re watch it a few more times. I think that'll be the most rewarding thing about this movie, being able to rewatch numerous times, and always getting something new after every viewing.I don't think this was done intentionally, but there were a few scenes and you'll know once you'll see them, but a few scenes almost felt like nods to earlier Nolan movies, and that's just something die hard Nolan fans will really appreciate I think?I think the opening sequence might be right up there with The Dark Knight Bank heist. It's just so beautifully shot and assembled, it starts off by batting a hundred, and really starts the movie perfectly.I hope this vague review is convincing enough for you to give this film a chance. I would recommend seeking out an IMAX 70MM venue, and if that's not available then perhaps an IMAX laser venue. If you want your experience to be a grand re-entry back to the theatre then IMAX is the way to go!"
2776,"Hard to describe why I've given it a 10 without spoiling it. The intricacies of the film are delicate and one misstep, and you'll be left falling behind.So keep up if you can. By the end of the film, if you've been paying attention, you'll understand why the protagonist is how is, and why everything exists in the story. Robert Pattinson is a revelation since his starring role in Good Times, and with The Batman already getting buzz since the latest trailer, I'm definitely a fan of his work and will be keying an eye out for his future roles."
2777,"Watching Tenet for first 45 minutes was just like watching any other Nolan made movie; clueless but intriguingly exciting and, unexpected hopeful. And just when the plot was taking shape-it was predictable in the most mediocre way possible.
I was not disappointed with the movie as a whole but with the plot; too simple of a story, tangled with confusion and wrapped too quickly to make sense. In terms of the concept of the movie it was new -one tenth of it at least, the rest was part here and part there - boiling it down to an old gift in a new present paper.
The wonderful parts of the movie were the fresh faces that you do not get to see otherwise in the Nolan made movies. However, it is always a delight to see Sir Michael Caine, and although it was more of a cameo role, it was graceful as always. There was humour that was not expect - bold and with a punch."
2778,"I wouldn't say this is the best Nolan film, but it is still one of the top ranking movies IMHO. As Nolan is know for, there are a lot of details in almost every scene that you'd watch out for. The plot itself is rather straightforward and may seem like a cliche, but it's topped with twists in timeline which provides a complete new perspective and makes it mind-boggling."
2779,"Mind blowing.
Nolan doesn't need a Oscar, he need a Nobel just for his brain."
2780,"I'm a hardcore Christopher Nolan's fan but not blind to the painful flaws this movie has.I couldn't be more hyped for this movie.. and it almost delivered. But overall it failed in the end. I really miss what this movie could have been. I cannot believe the rough edges were not taken into consideration when finishing this movie. It could have been a true masterpiece, probably the greatest movie by Nolan. Unfortunately it will stay ""only"" as an incredibly original movie, with exceptional visuals but that fails to deliver a full package that makes us care. We will not have goose bumps over this movie in years to come, and the reason is simply that we were not given enough time or emotional envolvment to care. But we got a visual and mind-bending spectacle though.In this movie you will find true originality. This movie solidifies Nolan's genius. Tenet brings something really new. And novelty is missing in movies like water in a desert. The acting is solid. The visuals are incredible. It's incredible what was done with the (few) FX. So what went wrong?1. The pace is too fast: This is a movie meant to be watched several times, we will all agree on that. Still, I don't want to care about the characters because I've watch them four times. Will not happen. Character development should have been deeper. We simply don't have time to care about any of the characters. No background, no future projection, no deep motivations, no development. The conversations are so fast, we don't have time to bond with anyone or anything.You can create an epic visual original story but if you don't make us care about the characters it's like watching a really beautiful and original light show. But we really don't care about light bulbs.2. There is no emotion: we enter a world where something truly new is presented. But there is hardly any reaction of the characters to this novelty. The robotic treatment to the mind-bending of time lacks amazement. It's like the concepts don't clash with reality when facts are presented. And they do. But we don't have time or dept to feel that. the lack of emotional response of the characters together with the extremely fast pace makes it difficult to entagle in the new reality that is presented. But is something visually unique3. Motivations: there is no proper exploration of characters motivations. ""We have a war to prevent. Here is mind/time bending stuff. Ok. Let's do it"". Im so disappointed that not enough time and depth was delivered. The ingredients are there but the full cake was not delivered4. Sound: I've liked the soundFx but they did not deliver the impact of sound use in previous Nolan's movies. I don't care about being too loud. I care if it hits the point where it potentiates the emotion. And - maybe because emotion is hardly felt throughout the movie and argument - it doesn't potentiate any emotion beyond the sound because there is a miss match between sound use and depth. Nolan did this so beautifully in the past. Here is simply doesn't work5. I will not go deeper but my recommendation is that you absolutely will watch this movie, but doesn't expect perfection. By far.Overall, thank the movie God's for Christopher Nolan, his originality and his gifts to the cinematic world. We got spoiled over the years with Interstellar, Inception, Dark Night etc. This could have been the greatest in a great list. But it's not in the end and the hard part is that it could have been"

2782,"The Protagonist has a mission that makes him rethink the world and time as we know it. The long-awaited new feature film by Nolan, and what a film. An authentic visual show, with a superb edit, impeccable at all levels, with tons of practical effects and a breathtaking soundtrack, although slightly exaggerated in terms of volume in some scenes. In terms of the story itself, it's the typical ""scratch your head"" Nolan style, during the first act, with very complex dialogues, full of dense information, but as soon as a viewer gets carried away, it's a crazy ride that leads us to connect small details that we saw earlier, that make a perfect loop of stifling action and drama. I may have to watch it again, in IMAX probably, to full enjoy this experience."
2783,"If there was one film that was going to put a halt to a pandemic then it was always going to be Tenet. A film so Earth-shattering in size and spectacle that people would pop on their masks, sanitise their little hands and sit one seat apart from everyone to experience the first blockbuster since corona came and ruined our lives.Christopher Nolan tends to divide opinion with people thinking he's the next messiah of the film world or a pseudo-intellectual bore who places big set-pieces above multi-layered characters and a meaningful plot. I'm very much on the former side of the scale. I rarely give a film 10/10 but I have given every Nolan film this rating post The Prestige and therefore regard him as one of the greatest filmmakers of the 21st century.Reviews for Tenet were decidedly mixed when previews were given to critics last Friday and so I did have some creeping doubts when I sat in front of the gigantic IMAX screen in Nottingham today. However, these doubts were put to rest within literally the first fifteen seconds of the film starting where I quickly realised that there was simply no experience quite like watching a thunderous Christopher Nolan film.The plot is almost impossible for me to spoil because my teeny tiny brain could barely comprehend any of what was going on. It also didn't help that half of the dialogue was lost due to the booming score. Not sure if this was due to the cinema I saw it in or poor sound mixing which Nolan has been criticised for before, naughty man. Frankly, I didn't care. A clue is given early on by an exposition-friendly scientist character who tries to help us understand the whole time inversion basis of the film where she quips, 'Don't try to understand it. Just feel it.'The concept does become slightly clearer as the film goes on, blowing our helpless minds in the process but it doesn't matter particularly. Part of the fun of watching a Christopher Nolan for the first time is getting as lost in the labyrinth of plot as the protagonist is. Inception and Interstellar felt almost as impenetrable upon first watch and have now been cracked thanks to multiple views and countless explanation videos on Youtube.Even if you can't be bothered to think, you're bound to be in awe of the spectacle of it all. Nolan never does anything by halves and by Christ he's pulled out every stop for this film. There's a string of insane action sequences which had me scooping my jaw off the floor countless times. The behind the scenes extras are going to be fascinating because I still can't wrap my head around how half of these stunts were done.Things only get more spectacular as the film goes on with sequences playing backward and forward sometimes at the same time. The intensity is also ramped up to 11 thanks to Ludwig Goransson's thumping, headache-inducing score. I was a little worried that things might feel a little odd with the absence of Hans Zimmer, but fear not, this is still the relentlessly thrilling Nolan blockbuster we all want be immersed in. It's a real cinematic experience which cannot be put into words.Detractors are always going to find things to criticise. One review called it 'humourless' which I find a little bizarre. Do they really want Kenneth Branagh to perform a tap-dancing routine as he's plotting to destroy the world? In actual fact, I was surprised to find quite a few witty lines which allowed us to stop holding our breath and breathe for just a second or two. If I were to find any criticism with the film then it would be that Kenneth Branagh's character (although brilliantly played) is a bit of a two-dimensional villain. However, he's so memorably vile that I found myself actually being quite terrified of him.During the explosive third act, my head was completely scrambled and I found myself wondering whether this whole film was the work of a genius or a madman. Who the heck could conjure up something this intricate and convoluted, yet remain so blissfully entertaining? What ever your opinion of Nolan you surely have to admire the sheer ambition and innovation he brings to the world of film. I can only imagine that the layers of Tenet's genius will be revealed upon multiple viewings and they're viewings that most of us are going to want to take. My head was completely spinning when I stepped outside into the real world. To sum Tenet up in a one-word palindrome, WOW!"
2784,"The best way I can describe it is this generations version of The Matrix... nothing to do with plot or type of film but in the way that it's completely original, new type of action that's never been seen before ground-breaking film"
2785,"Tenet (5 out of 5 stars).Tenet is an awesome spy film that takes action and an epic thrill ride with its story. Christopher Nolan has done it again with a complex story which may require a couple of viewings to fully understand the time inversion concept. I did find the film to be little less complicated than Inception. As your put in The protagonist shoes (John David Washington) who is joined in this world of espionage and time inversion. Like one character tells him. The less you understand it. The better. Which does make for a better awesome experience just enjoying the movie as it goes along.Its better to watch the movies story for yourself without spoilering it. Besides its about a Protagonist who is not given a name. Is thrown in a world of espionage to stop Sator (Kenneth Branagh) from creating world war 3.The plot is epic. The movie is filled with a lot of action. A lot of practical action stunt work. The opening sequence was intense with a shoot out in a opera house. Was confusing on what was going on but well done after a few mins it all makes sense. The action sequences is loud, big, and breathtaking. The music score by Ludwig Gorransson is amazing. His electronic and loud scores really made the movie an amazing ride. Being loud in every action scene. Creating the intense feeling.The cast ensemble is great too. John David Washington is great playing as a mysterious Protagonist who is in a shadowy organization. Robert Pattinson is also great playing Neill who accompany the main character. And is involved in the action. Elizabeth Debicki is great playing as Kat, a lady who is stuck in between with the bad guy and her freedom. Dimple Kapadia playing a character which everytime she speaks. She sounds like a character from the Matrix. Michael Cain in a small brief role was also good. Kenneth Branagh is great as the villain.The visual effects. Cinematography and set pieces are all an cinematic experience that deserves to be seen on the big screen. The 747 plane crashing was intense. The epic car chases with time moving forward and backward was thrilling. The fight sequences was insane. The epic climax. Where it goes crazy than ever where soldiers are moving forward and backward in a battlefield was intense with explosions and shoot outs.Christopher Nolan script and direction is one of the best. Making this one of his best movies yet. Kind of feels like a James Bond kind of movie mixed with a little science fiction. From the globe trotting set pieces. Action and a plot.Tenet is one of the best movies of the year that needs to be seen on the big screen."
2786,Great movie! The people who wrote it are far smarter than I. Requires a research study afterwards. Lol MUST WATCH AGAIN
2787,Christopher Nolan amazes us again. A mind blending movie that makes your mind blown
2788,"Thanks Christopher Nolan For the piece of art.
best movie in 2020👏🏻.Thanks to the all cast Especially John David Washington son of the Legend Denzel Washington, and Robert Pattinson"
2789,"Tenet is a fantastic film, it is a sci-fi action, with an immense scale.The action itself is both a mix between James Bond homage, breathtaking shots, but most importantly well-edited action scenes. Even Nolan's haters won't be able to criticize him on that as those action sequences are already meant to be references. In simpler words, Nolan topped himself in directing action sequences.When I said that Tenet is immense in scale, I meant it, it is shot in many countries, and it is almost on Dunkirk's level in terms of extras.All the elements pointed below brought us the most immersive film of 2020. I think that you should definitely see this one on IMAX!"
2790,"Christopher Nolan is arguably the most visionary director of all time even if you are not a fan of his work you would agree with this statement. Tenet sees Nolan exploring his favourite concept ""Time"" in reserve flow which is Time Travel but with ""objects"" moving in reverse. Like every other Time Travel film Tenet also has its unanswered paradoxes.John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debecki and Kenneth Brannagh completely knocked it with their performances. Ludwig's score is so good that you wouldn't miss Hans Zimmer in a Nolan film. Tenet definitely is bound to win multiple best editing and best visual effects awards. The biggest disappointment is the sound mixing, in some parts of the film it's very hard to understand the dialogue with the background noise.The name Tenet a palindrome itself gives away a major spoiler in the film. It's best to watch the film without thinking too much about how the reversal flow of time works as it's not the key part of the film but just the way the world is set in. This requires multiple viewings and with each viewing you would like it more. Tenet is not Nolan's Bond movie but rather his latest addition to the universe of Time after Memento, Inception and Interstellar."
2791,"Amazing Action and sound, physics laws stretched to entertainment , great sound and you get out the Theater er willing for someone who can explain you the plot!"
2792,"Cinema is a place for entertainment not a complex study class
Please Nolan take it easy, we are not on a noble prize competition"
2793,"I've seen many reviews say it was confusing, while there are confusing aspects it's not hard to follow, it's a truly amazing film in need of high praise."
2794,"Mix of Inception and Memento
The Movie was fire but it just needed a little touch of drama.
Anyway, the movie is magnificent and it will stun people who love Nolan's way in making movies"
2795,Everything perfect I want watch it again kind a movie
2796,"It doesn't have to be perfect. It just has to be different. Like the movie's nature, to illustrate difference to the effect of stagnancy, but to no cost of worth, this educational principle is to no effect of losing its worth by not being a criticism of Tenet.In terms of franchise-ideas, just having to be different perhaps would rank along the mid to upper to upper level (in no way is this a pun or a reference to the movie's public invocation of snobbery); I gift Tenet said educational principle, because of its ranking in line of thing-ism."
2797,"On first watch, viewers might feel a little overwhelmed by what is going on in the plot. A 2nd viewing is needed to fully piece together the big picture. To paraphrase a quote from Tenet, 'Don't try to understand it. Feel it.'"
2798,"A Genius Magician Director 'Christopher Nolan's TENET gave me Goosebumps in every department. Specially in Time Inversion Visual. BGM is Top Notch, Totally Oscar Deserving Direction, BGM, Screenplay & Editing. This Movie Is Masterpiece 👌"
2799,"Well Well Well, This movie is by far more complex than Inception, It's going to take multiple viewings to truly appreciate the concept of the story. I recommend at least 2 or 3 mandatory viewings, Because there are so many things hidden throughout the 2 hours and half. You need to pay attention and listen closely to the dialogue.
The action in the movie was really enjoyable and you can easily notice Nolan's touch in it, Especially in the first scene with that brilliant sequence shot from the cinematographer.However there are some things I didn't like about this movie. There was so much depth in the story that took an extremely space and even took over some of the main characters development, But generally the movie was great, It's definitely not Nolan's best work but I enjoyed it, I really did."
2800,"When You Watch the movie for the first time and you can't get your gripp on the pace it will like catching the train which is getting away and away.
Finally You Give Up you say this is like too much.
The Moment the the first frame comes on to the screen it pics up the pace immediately. If You Blink for a moment you are lost.
Even if you don't blink keep yourself sharp and aware at all times.
Time Travel is a very intriguing subject due to various theories related to it. Christopher Nolan is director who has a reputation of making films on such subjects with his own twists.Things To See In films
1. The Plot is very simple its an espionage story the world is ending and it needs a savior.
2. Gripping Background Score
3. AWESOME CINEMATOGRAPHY
4. Brilliant Performances of the movie characters.
5. Thrilling Action Sequences
."
2801,"Tenet is Nolan at his usual peak of conceptual mastery. But the cracks which were evident in his previous films are more pronounced here. The cracks in character depths and dialogues. It is almost like everything else is secondary to the concept. And high-concept films can surely be made with compelling characters. Ask Blade Runner, Primer or even Nolan's previous endeavours, which managed to not be completely soulless. But the central relationships in Tenet seem... robotic.I'm in awe of the concept and everything. And I'll need to revisit it to get a clearer picture. But I'm not really looking forward to it."
2802,Very well directed and watched more to know what the protagonist role is..
2803,If you want to understand what is happening I think you have watch it 2 or 3 time😂
2804,"I will start by saying I dislike most Nolan movies, but conversely, I love the ideas behind most of his films. All his projects try to be clever (with the emphasis on try) yet fall very short. They also suffer from being a bit soulless and empty, clinical, if you will. There are usually a bucket of plot holes and for some reason the start of his movies are pretty boring.Both Inception and the awful Interstellar were examples of this.I will also add, I genuinely admire his technical ability as a filmmaker and I want to like his films, the ambitious subject matters he addresses are right up my street.Tenet is the first Nolan film, I have liked. It is the first film where I have not found myself rolling my eyes in shock about how bad the features were. I got interested in this and wanted to see every part of it and to try to understand it (which is a big ask). I have generally found his previous stuff, dumb, yet trying to be clever.Now this is very far from a 10/10 movie, but I do think it is the best thing Nolan has done (most of his other films are below 4/10 for me).
The problems are:
Some smart arses (liars, let us be honest) say it is understandable. To be frank, it is extraordinarily complicated and hard to get your head around. I would not say it is impossible, but you would need lots of diagrams and re-watches to really get it.Mumbling dialog, what is with Nolan and his sound issues. I would like to hear what the actors are saying.The beginning of the film needed a re-write, far too drawn out, largely needless scenes at the start that could have been much more effective, if trimmed down.Standard paradox stuff, obviously by killing the Kenneth at the start, many other events would not have occurred that resulted in other actions.Motivations, it was very hard to know why people were doing what they were doing, what was the big battle scene at the end, who was fighting whom, there did not seem to be anyone other than two teams there. They blew up an empty building for some reason. What was the benefit of the time pincer operation at the end?Couldn't they have just gone back in time and killed Kenneth themselves rather than the convoluted, unnecessary use of the wife. Just blow him up and his boat some time in the past.The driving scene did not make much sense, why would the forward car effectively follow the reversing car (if you get what I am saying). The reversing car chased the forward driving car, as we learnt, if you are in the reverse-universe, you appear to be going backwards, yet both cars are in sync.However, the reverse/forwards scenes were amazing, it must have taken a huge effort to get those right. I did follow the plot right up to the end, it did retain my interest, the first Nolan film to do so.I will give it a 6, maybe generous, but I did find it interesting."
2805,TO SEE MANY TIMES WITHOUT BORING....I REALLY ENJOY.ED...BECAUSE I LEARNED MANY CONCEPTS AND SCIENTIFIC TERMS...THE CLIMAX SCENES ARE VERY INSPIRE TO NOLAN...CLIMAX SCENE MASS.......NICE AND I WAITING ANOTHER MOVIE OF NOLAN...I THINK TO TAKE TENET PART 2 PLZ ......
2806,"This is a movie Not for the uninitiated or the simple minded ones.
You need at least a good amount of critical thinking present in that box of yours , so that you can at least try and start to manage the multitude of timelines present in this movie.
Definitely needs more than one viewing to understand the gravity of this film.
The characters are all very credible. Unique action scenes. The score is very well fitting and compliments the movie well. Feels convoluted from start to finish, but if you manage to unite all the dots, it rewards you."
2807,"First let's start with the bad thing: You need to watch it twice or three times to really understand every aspect of the film. Memento, Inception etc. seem like a kid's play regarding the complexity of the scenario.
But believe me, you will love to watch it again...And now the good thing: The sript and direction of this film is probably the best you can get till nowadays. Nolan proves once more that he is the most highly-intelligent person in the industry today (he is the writer too as he was in Inception and Memento...).
The no-CGI effects you ll have ever seen, the film is full of cult scenes, not referring to any, not to spoil things for the non-viewers,but there are at least 5 scenes soooo unique.Surely best film of the year, and for me, surely of the decade in terms of scipt and direction. Just watch it concentrated, full of energy and more than once and this will be a unique exprerience. It was filmed on 1570 film so excited to see this in 8K and 16K in the years to come..."
2808,"As said by so many other reviewers.I've read some those with lowest and highest ratings and I just want to give you a perspective of why there's such a split between them.This is a Nolan movie, but it's not the same as other Nolan movies.If you watch this in non-IMAX theater, chance are you won't be able to understand much of the conversations. This is a combination of dialogs seemingly having too much reverb and the ambience that always play a low-tune key throughout. For the majority of the movie you will guesswork on whatever was happening.Here is what has came to be the hallmarks of Christopher Nolan: mind-thriller with a focus on human element, while accompanied by an innovative concept in movie making. The last one is the only thing you should expect in this film.If you came into this treating it as a run-of-the-mill action movie - you will get the action, but also be put off by confusion at what exactly is going on and what is it that you suppose to get out of that action sequence. In other Nolan's films if even you can't understand the mechanics you will know at least if the 'good guys' win the fight. Unless you keep up with the conversations, you won't know exactly is the objectives of some of the action scenes. And if you already lost at the beginning, it only will get worse toward the end.If you came into this treating it as a classic Nolan - you (might) be disappointed. The exposition is short (even shorter than Interstellar) for what's going down, and the plot and characters are cliche as a whole. The emotions are deprived of passion, and few that are there are too one-dimensional to be invested in. And most important of all: there is no character development for the protagonist. He is the exact person he started out. You can say it's inversion thing, that it has to end the same way it would start, but in practical it will take out the enjoyment for the people who expect some level of metaphysical realization at the end. Some old fans might also suggest that it's just an obnoxious attempt by Chris to gather all the famous actors, putting them on a world trip and call it a movie. If you are those people who would think so, there's little anyone could say to convince you otherwise - you already decided with conviction to hate the movie forever.If you are a physicist and/or realist - you might get turned off from some elements. ""Bad guys can't aim"" trope is still here (considering bad guys in Inception are mostly non-human, it's a lot less defend-able here), and the specific details of how inversion would actually work is left up with the quote ""don't try to understand it, just feel it"". There's a lot of stuffs that doesn't make sense, and the more you delve into it the more convoluted it gets. There is a logical explanation for every 'plot-hole', but some people can find it unsatisfactory. But it will basically boil down to the interactions between inverted and non-inverted, at which point you have to leave it to creative realm.So who is left that could possibly enjoy Tenet?People aren't used to thinking in reverse. For me, just imagining how a subject would decay backward to the past already give mental exhaustion. But I like imagining it just because I'm a theoretical idealist.The movie will cover all the action-sequence playbooks. It will build you up like a tutorial, so you can prepare your mental comprehension for the next sequences. Because there is a LOT of genuine details that you will have to notice to enjoy the actions to its fullest. This is a movie solely about mechanics. If there is a visual answer to 'how would these mechanics play out in that situation?', Tenet would have it. And there are a lot of those situations. That is where the magic of the movie is. You question how it would go, and it delivers. The better you are at grasping and applying concepts, the more enjoyable the movie is. You will find yourself going awe again and again, just because it's such an impressive feat to put something so abstract in a film with so little visual effects. When you think about it like that, you will understand that the plot was only there to drive the 205-million-dollars budget worth of hypothetical vision to its realization.There will be things you have not seen for a Nolan film before: hip song, and slapstick. There will be things you have seen before in a Nolan film: great cinematography, and people in classy suits.So if something like 4D-cube intrigue your imagination, go watch the movie. The movie is worth all the exposure it can get. It will inspire the right people, and criticized by some of the wrong one too. If you 'feel' it, you will enjoy it.We all believe we'd avoid the movie we hate. But until we watch the movie, we can never know."
2809,"Honestly people, those of you who gave this film a 1/10 or 3/10, seriously, can you do us all a favour and just throw your computer and phone in the garbage. There are plenty of ""easy-watching"" films being thrown in your face all the time, but just like catchy but simple pop songs and easy drinking beers, these are just familiar platitudes that rob you of so much more! - that is the chance to be amazed! To be wowed! To have groundbreaking art! For someone to dare to change the medium! Tenet was confusing as hell, but it was also invigorating, shamelessly pioneering, and larger than life! If this doesn't amaze you, well then, go on back to the commonplace drivel you've been fed all your life. Nolan and his work is too superior to receive 1's and 3's."
2810,I HOPE TO SEE THE NEXT VERSION of this film as it was so dimensional I can't express how I used hours to decrypt this fantastic movie after so much hastle
2811,This is a good film..but its really sterile. It basically feels like you are in a dentist waiting room..it's a busy room with a lot happening but all you can hear is the drill in the other room with the sound of the person next to you muffledThe actors were good. The setting was ok. The plot though I found it really difficult to care a whole lot. There was an urgency..but this urgency didn't seem world defining.So yeah it's ok but doesn't even touch inception to be fair.
2812,"Please do your homework on entropy, godfather paradox, palindrome.
Unless feel the movie in the name of Mr. Nolan.
This is the film can introduce you to new level of filmography.
#Happywatching"
2813,"A crossover of Memento and Inception and everything in between. This is a very complex movie that will make your brains hurt for 2 and a half hours trying to follow the story. Not the best Christopher Nolan film but if you are a fan of his work, this is a treat. The visual adaptation is top notch, with a very good storyline ( If you can figure it out ). A tip in watching this movie, "" Don't understand it, feel it""."
2814,I agree on first watch it does not look that grand like INCEPTION but trust me as you understand more about Time inversion you would see how difficult it is to even imagine this concept and to put in such manner.INCEPTION is my all time favorite movie but TENET scores in terms of complexity of the concept aka Time inversion.I really like the Background music and few scenes where we see things going in reverse. Overall years and years this film would be discussed and only those would love who will try to understand the movie more and more
2815,"I've really enjoyed many of Nolan's films so looked forward to this.
I will watch it at least once more and may well up my rating.I agree with some of the feedback already given,
the Movie was very loud, and during some scenes I actually had to cover my ears and I could still hear everything I needed.During other scenes the dialogue was mumbled and I couldn't hear it, this is common in Hollywood now though, I reflected on watching movies at home on demand where I can rewind or even switch on subtitles briefly, not wanting to miss important information, or possibly I'm going deaf because of paragraph 2, above.I felt the story was interesting and unique, looking forward to understanding it more, wish there was still IMDb discussion forums, would love to hear other people's opinions and theories"
2816,Already found 1 error without watching it twice. Way to difficult a movie for the mainstream numskulls. Kudo's for the idea and execution tho :D
2817,"Creative and intelligent story, great casting, suspense-packed with lots of action - a movie excellently executed with an eye for detail - All in all great entertainment."
2818,"Tenet:
a principle, belief, or doctrine generally held to be true especially: one held in common by members of an organization, movement, or profession.
Mirriam-WebsterTenet is no ordinary movie. It's one of those movies some will love and some do hate. Creation of a deeply abstract mind. it's not easy to relate with, it's actually hard. But does it worth the effort? As I was watching the movie, I hoped from bottom of my heart, that it would surprise me and bring me one of those memorable moments of joy and soak me in pleasure Did it? I decided to write this review to share my experience.
As this is a rather long review, I set an index so you may skip a part as you wish.Index:
A) Goofs
B) A brief analysis
C) Step by step review of the key part of the movie
D) And few words from heartA) Goofs:
In this part I brought goofs in the movie's form(what we see) and contents(what we understand). The time is also mentioned which can be a little more or less due to different versions of the movie.00:03 - The protagonist smashes the glass and jump out of with the contact. To a saloon filled with anesthesia gas. The protagonist wearing a mask but not the contact.00:04 - P(The Protagonist) goes out of saloon to take the package. Returns to saloon. Goes to basement. Why didn't he directly goes to basement?00:06 - Non of does trains has a driver/operator to see whats happening out there?
By the way, the trains Mise-en-scène is a disaster. Each time camera goes from P to the other guy, trains change. White, red, scaffold, lumber, tanker. Also the directions are not intact.00:08 - After opening his eyes, P looks down and sees the sea. But the sea is behind him.00:13 - In the lab, while reverse bullets are being introduced. The gun should be exactly pointed to a hole with exact angle. Otherwise the bullet would not go straight and have to bend while traveling from target back to gun.
By the way, where does the jacket comes from? Bullet comes from that stone, but how does the jacket comes to the chamber? Same to the gunpowder.00:34 - The SUV enters the ramp with a signal light over the head of driver. When it exists, the light is gone.00:43 - When P and Neil are picking the door, they look at the white door, dangling. If the door is broken, there can't be a vacuum. So they can breathe normally.00:56 - In the boat scene, first they are all on the left side of the boat(port side). Long shot, they're in right side(starboard side)
Close, left again.
Then Cath orders to change side. Everyone stands. Next, the are going to left side!
(Brilliant, isn't it)01:05 - What is that helicopter doing in a closed room?01:07 - A 1kg gold bar worths about 60,000$. Each gram of plutonium worths 4,000$. As P says in while cruising, 750g of plutonium was missed, witch worths about 4,000,000$. Isn't 60,000$ a low advanced payment?01:12 - When Andrei spit on Cath, why she reacts as she has been shot or kicked?01:13 - Escort cars have light-bars on top. Next scene, no light-bars.01:13 - As they want to surround the plutonium truck:
High angle camera shows a 2 lane street, becoming 3 lane.
From BMW view, it is 2 lane.
High angle, there is again becoming 3 lane for last truck.
From the truck, it's 3 lane again.Another important thing is, cars won't work in reversed time. It's not like driving in reverse. The engine won't work. It would try to suck in air from the tailpipe to cylinders. Also will try to pump petroleum from cylinders back to the tank. Let aside that it won't even start. In reversed time, electricity would go backward and non of the electronics would function. What have you got us into, Christopher?!!!01:19 - P rolls down the window. Cut, its up again. Next, down again.01:20 - Andrei and the driver move from SUV to Mercedes. Leaving Cath alone. If you reverse the scene, it is: SUV it coming without a driver until driver climbs in.
The driver is reversed too. He wears a mask.01:22 - Cath needs to use a mask, without getting reversed. In the SUV she doesn't wears a mask. But coming to the room, she wears one.
Up unit now, the movie is a perfect disaster. Even though I didn't mention goofs not worthy of talking or those could have been used for dramatization.Shortly I will go step by step through 01:22 - 01:34.
Finally in the third hour of the movie however, I couldn't find any goofs whatsoever.B) A Brief Analysis:
Tenet has three parts
1. Beginning until after 241 is stolen in highway.
2. Peak of the movie is in that twin rooms till explosion of the car. Which also the key to the movie. Which we'll go through!
3. The final battle puts everything had been told previously, to action. It's like in the first two hours the movie had been feeding us with new elements and ideas, now in next half an hour it provides something strange, unbelievable and obscure and we understand it. It's outstanding.In Tenet, Nolan does the same thing to TIME that he did to SPACE in Inception. FOLDING. Do you remember folding the street? A street was folded as the traffic continues. But the cars which where going, are now coming. That folding point is the merry-go-round in Tenet. The time which goes by, now comes by! Rotate the street by 90 degrees counterclockwise. You get the twin rooms and the MGA.I suggest a short break, before you continue. It's getting worse.As the movie is in max complex mode, the characters are as simple as possible.
Good guys are good. Bad guys are bad.
Good guys: ethical. don't kill. won't cheat. Keep their promises. They apologize if they do wrong. They appreciate if someone does something for them. They ask, if they don't know something. They make right decisions.
Bad guys: kill. Cheat. Cruel. Don't think of anything but themselves. If they're not going to have something, they destroy it. Whether a woman, whether the whole universe.The music was almost too much for me. I was this close to mute it or even loose my trust in Tenet and Nolan. It was extremely offensive(like in offense/defense. Not that it offended me). It invaded the mind to crush it to the ground. I don't like this kind of music in movies. It gives me the feeling that director is unable to say whatever she/he/D is trying to say and wants to force it on me by other means. This happened to ""The Dark"" series and I stopped watching after 2-3 episodes.
The music was almost only rhythm and no melody. It's only purpose was to numb the mind and kill the processing of the brain. With no feeling. Didn't like it a bit.Motives:
Nolan used most basic and real motivations for its characters. Spouse, children. In general, survival. Survival of the person, survival of descendants and survival of race(human been). Which he calls ""Prosperity"".
The movie is free from those unnatural and man-made motivations like nationalism, racism, ethics, etc. A single human been, a single universe. I liked it a lot.C) A step by step review of the key part of movie:Tenet should be re-edited in mind! What we see in the movie, is final concussion of all that happened. Combination of many ""normal times"" and many ""reversed times"". As if the ""Time Reverse"" was possible, someone from outside would observe. I can say it's same as analogue color printing. First a blank sheet goes to printer and receive just red colors. Again it enters to the printer and receives blue colors. And again it goes to the printer and receives the yellow color. The result? A color print with hundreds of colors. As it is in Tenet. First events happen in normal time. Then reversed time events get added. And maybe more normal time or reversed time events gets added. Different colors of printing. Layer by layer. So is Tenet.As peak of the movie, in my opinion, is after stealing of 241 till waking in the ship, I write my own edit of the movie:
After P gets back from the fire truck, he gets to the traffic jam without any problem. (cut out Andrei's car and the other reversed car).
Andrei's gang arrive there and shootings start.
They get P but they can't find 241.
They take P to that twin room in normal time. (there is no one in reversed time room. It's empty)
They wait for Andrei to arrive and enter to normal time room(reversed time room is still empty)
Andrei couldn't find 241 in the BMW and asks P where did he put it.
P answers: I already told you.
Andrei doesn't know the answer yet and looks to himself in reversed time room.
Neil's backup team arrives.
Andrei flee to reversed time.(as time reverses, Neil's team are not there yet)
Andrei threatens P via Cath. Cath is not shot yet. Andrei shoots her with reversed bullet. Cath is in normal time(she didn't enter the mga)
Andrei and some of his men go out in reversed time. Cath is in normal time(remember in the SUV, she talks to P normally)
(now we should go back to highway scene when Andrei's car is coming towards P. But in reversed time
Andrei's Mercedes is coming wrong way in the highway. SUV too(with the goof I mentioned before)
Now P decides to come out in reversed time
Andrei with two other goes to traffic jam shooting with Mercedes sedan, looking for 241. Which he can't find.
P finds the orange box and puts he's headset in it so he can hear Andrei's voice.
It's now that Andrei speaks in the radio(the voice Neil says: its not Estonian, it's reversed.)
P in reversed time reaches to P in normal time in highway. Where Andrei is there too. Normal time P throw 241 to reversed time P's car and the empty box to Andrei.
P's car gets crashed.
Andrei in reversed time, continues chasing P in realtime and threatens him via Cath(first things we see after stealing of 241 from the truck but in reverse mode)
Andrei comes back to P's crashed car, takes 241. Boom...
(...aaand scene)
I think I broke my tongue, brain too... These are hard to say even in mother tongue, let alone in another language.Continue in next post..."
2819,I think if anyone watched Three seasons of Dark they are in good position to predict the end of the movie around halftime. It's not the first time there mind is seeing this. Probably Dark ruined the movie for me not the sound effects.
2820,"Amazing director.
From the beginng, until the end you don't know what's coming.
Very intresting."
2821,"Good overall, though there was a scene where the editing/positioning was off each time the camera switched angles (restaurant conversation between the protagonist and the woman).Also, left me scratching my head - how does the future/older protagonist hire his younger past self? Does this open it up to a sequel, actually a prequel, where we find out how he was originally hired, and what necessitates him to act and get his younger self involved sooner? Or is this just an oversight as Nolan crammed so many other easter eggs in to the story? Does it matter? I'm really just posting this so someone might explain that to me..."
2822,"I'm a fan of time travel movies. But in Tenet people don't travel in time. Time itself travels, so that action is reversed for incredible effect, and with potentially world-ending consequences. Sounds powerful and it is to a point; but what would have helped me get more emotionally involved in the movie is if the small scale human-level direct and indirect effects would have been inter-woven with the bigger plot driver around saving the world. But that doesn't really happen, at least not to my satisfaction. To explain, it's said when you travel to a foreign country that it's the small differences that resonate. This movie did not resonate with me."
2823,After watching great movies like Inception and interstellar i expected more from chris nolan!
2824,"The store is mind blowing and Nolan's direction is out of the world!
It's a movie everyone need to watch..coz it's a type movie you can never get to see again"
2825,"So first time watching it I figured out what the story was about and what happened but the beauty of this movie is figuring out HOW it happened,there's lots of elements you never gonna pick up with watching it once,I've already watched it 4 times and honestly it gets better every time,one of the best movies of the past few years,but if you don't have the excitement of analysing a complicated movie don't watch it!!!"
2826,"Really appreciate the plot nodes in the screenplay which hold us until end, now I regret for my low marks in physics ....damn"
2827,"I always liked movies with complex plot like this one. Of course, some things make no sense at all, but only from the first glance. I love movies, where you need to think while it lasts, and when it's already finished.I did love Nolan's directing as usually, but has he gone too far with this intellectual stuff? In my opinion, he has not.The plot took my breath away, and I couldn't stop watching the movie. After watching it for the first time, I am still puzzled by certain details. Will have to re-watch it one more time to get a better idea of what the h**l happened :DEven though I liked the soundtrack, the music itself was too loud. That's why it's 9 out of 10."
2828,HATS OFF TO NOLAN...LOVE TENETTHE CAST WAS AMAZING...
2829,"Switching between gorgeous visuals and bad audio mixing, this is definitely not Nolan's finest film, but you could handle it if you are familiar with his previous works. Due to its unique nonlinear structures and convoluted narrative you need more rewatches in order to enjoy it."
2830,It's a masterpiece for them who understand whole movie. Otherwise go and watch pogo. Background voice is too loud but we can hear all dialogue. Awesome story and actions scenes 😍
2831,"Hello, dear ones
Here I want to point out some points in Christopher Nolan's film Tent that you probably did not notice.
This movie is about the ability to reverse time. Well, so far the name of the movie
TENET
Did you pay attention? This word is made the same word from every side that is read. Tip 2 Well, based on the movie, it is enough to take this name in the same way, that is, capital letters in front of the mirror, which means that you are actually reversing the word. This is exactly the same. There is a logo that was supposed to be used for the film, but due to its resemblance to a company's brand logo and copyright laws, the film was not given to the film even after being offered the right to use this type of writing by the brand owner. This is exactly the text that was supposed to be used on the cover of the film. Do you see a line in the middle of the image? What do you see before the line? written
TEN
Well, now look at the second part, which has been reversed. Again, what do you see if you look at it in reverse? again
TEN
Well now
TEN or (10)
What does it mean in the film?
The number ten is repeated many times in the film, some of which I will mention
First of all, early in the film, the protagonist (John David Washington) tells Neil (Robin Pattinson) that I only want 10 minutes to meet Sanjay Singh.At the end of the film, each is divided into two groups, a group that enters the area normally, that is, from the real world, and a group that enters the area through reversed time, and each has 10 minutes.
The first group started their operation at 10 o'clock for 1 hour, ie 10 to 11 o'clock
At 11 o'clock, the second group completes their operation 1 hour behind, that is, until 10 o'clock
So what does 10 mean to Nolan?
1. The script of the film ""Indoctrination"" has been written for 10 years.
2. Indoctrination of the movie was released in 2010.
3. 10 years after the movie Indoctrination, ie 2020, the movie Tent was released.
4. He has directed 10 other films before Tent Nolan.
5. Tent film has been shot in 7 countries for 3 months (total of 10 pieces)
6. Nolan spent 5 decades (10) of his life at the time of the film's release and has become like a new decade (10) of his life.
It is not clear how many of the above examples are intended by the director himself.
But whatever it is, the number 10 has a special meaning for the director.
It is said that the closest meaning in Persian to the name of the film is ""Angashteh"".
The idea, the idea, the certainty of other translations of the film
Maybe the name in the movie means that
1. The protagonist, according to an official at the beginning of the film, is dead after eating the film and thinks he is alive.
The protagonist is convinced that the world is in danger and causes him to get involved.
3. At the end of the film, he is given the impression that he himself is the initiator of this story at another time.
4. He thinks that the world is being destroyed, which may not be the case. In fact, he has helped another group that intends to create chaos.
It is very likely that this movie will continue, because the device that causes the destruction of the world has not been destroyed either.
We may see a new dog from Nolan.
1. In the middle of the movie, Hein shows our spies the number three of Sator's car chase.
Note that it may indicate the number E 2. If you pay attention to the inverted name of the movie, the letter
3 in order to be triple.
3. At the end of the film, three people share the destroyer piece.
4. The film talks about 3 different times: present, past and future in order to be triple or to continue the film
At the end of the film, Neil tells the protagonist that he will see the adventure again at the beginning
Here are two points that come to mind:
1. At the beginning of the film, the doctor says, ""This technology has come from the future to the present.""
2. At the end of the film, Neil tells the protagonist, ""You have a great future in the past.""
If the film continues, the above two sentences make it difficult for us to understand whether the next film will take place in the past or in the future.
A sentence is heard at the beginning of the film
Protagonist:
we live in a twilight world
And in response
and there are no friends at dusk
Translation: We live in a world of dusk and we have no friends in it
1. If we consider twilight in the world of espionage. The second sentence implies that we can not trust any of the spies in the film, for example, Neil says that the protagonist himself has hired him. He has more information and hides things from him. He may have been hired by the protagonist himself, but his goal is not to save the world, and this story is hidden from him in the past.
2. Twilight World is the name of a song from
swing out sister
Is in the lyrics of the song from the end of time and distrust of the world of dusk. And in the music video, he sometimes moves in the opposite direction and dances.
If you pay attention to the whole film, from the very beginning, the characters from the future are present in the beginning of the story by reversing the time, which will be revealed to us in the continuation of the film.
If you look closely at the director's own film ""Interstellar,"" at the beginning of the film Matthew McConaughey's daughter insists that the sands want to communicate with her, but her father does not pay attention. After a while, they realize that the sands show spatial coordinates. At the end of the film, it is revealed that it was Matthew McConaughey who is in a relationship to help himself or his daughter.
Now, in the movie Tent, we may see a series of events at different times that are constantly repeated. Isn't it clear that we saw several loops from this chain during the film? Maybe the beginning of the chain
Whatever it is, the film continues in my opinion.
Considering Nolan's previous films, such as Indoctrination, in which there were points in that film as well, it is not unlikely that the above points are true. Understanding whether it is true or not determines it at the same time.
In an interview, Christopher Nolan said, ""I want all the fans and viewers of my work around the world to see the film and each of them to express their opinion about the film.""Author: Seyed Afshin Shariati"
2832,"The Cinematography of the film is outstanding. One has to be very clear with the concept of entropy , time inversion to understand this movie. A bit Confusing as Nolan movies are but an Outstanding movie. Nolan's Fans would love it ."
2833,"Tenet is probably the best movie of Chris Nolan in the trilogy of Inception, Interstellar and Tenet. While the acting is a bit flat, but the movie makes up for it. Every rule of time travel is defined and beautifully adhered to. Every move makes sense, while in the first watch everything seemed random.
The music is poorer than interstellar/ Inception but still engaging. The IMAX format was excellently shot.10/10 for me."
2834,"For the first time, I watched the movie in a movie theater. The concept of the movie is genius like all of Nolan's movies. It takes an original director such as Nolan to translate such a concept into a fine movie. I think Nolan successfully was able to develop the idea in his own unique and genius way. when I watched it for the first time, I understood the concept of the movie, but sometimes I got lost in the details, for a couple of reasons. first, is the sound, sometimes I could barely hear the conversations, I think to follow the movie fully, you should be able to hear and analyze the movie (actually the music is way louder than the conversations. Maybe there is a reason for this and it is the intention of the director to make the dialogs and cheaters no too significant compared to the entire plot of the movie). 2. This is just my humble opinion as an amateur viewer; Sometimes it appeared to me that the scenes change were sudden and fragmented. It could be better to extend some scenes to make it appear more sequential. However, when I watched the movie for the second time and with a subtitle, it made more sense to me. I think to fully appreciate Nolan's movies you should watched them more than once, as there are hidden messages that is hard to get for the first watch. I should also mention that the music in this movie is amazing. My score is based on my opinion of the movie after I watched it for the second time.
In a time where big superhero movies that are full of special effects and empty content attract viewers and gain big box office, TENET is a blessing. So I think as a viewer, we should stop being lazy about movies (what I mean is, we should be more intellectually involved) and encourage the filmmakers to make more of these type of movies. My advice. Watch the movie for the first time, if you get it for the first time, Awesome, but if you didn't, don't be disappointed. watched it for the second time with a subtitle. you will enjoy it even more."
2835,"1st view something great happened, 2nd view Nolan is God of his TIME."
2836,"Well, here im watched once but I can't understand but later i can. This is like physics if you want to understand physics you need to revise.I'm very much delighted about the subject & screenplay handled by Nolan."
2837,Hats off the direction it was such a amazing and about story so confusing unique concept watch this masterpiece
2838,"In a time where we dont see original films anymore, just copies of copies of the copies, comes chris nolan. It's like a poem you never understand reading at first so you have to read again and again. I guess people are forgeting cinema is also a kind of art. great movie!"
2839,"Kick the critics just go and book your tickets enjoy the masterpiece from nolan don't try to understand it , feel it ."
2840,"I love Christopher Nolans work. So after 30 minutes I was wondering what the lad had been smoking.
Then little things started tweaking in my noggin saying stay the course.
By 90 minutes I'm hooked and beginning to get upset about what film in my top 5 is being relegated.
I get the it's hard to follow once argument.
But luckily my brain is wired wrong.Please set aside 3 hours (15 minutes for monthly ablutions... 15 for Facebook) and enjoy the ride"
2841,"Okay. For me this movie is good, but not spectacular as Inception & Interstellar. Maybe i have to watch this movie twice or three time to understand the whole story. Nice movie.My rating : 7.5"
2842,Every time when I am watching Nolan movies I am amazed that how he can write scripts like this but while watching tenet he done a world class script work I liked every thing but the movie is slow sometimesCAUTION:Don't try to understand it just feel it
2843,"Excellent screen ply
This movie any one scene was not boring.....very engaging.
Time inversion concept excellently execute to cinimotography ....
Bgm score awasome
Totally Nolan's another new great movie"
2844,"The thing about capers is not the detail, it's men watching other men doing some interesting work. There will be busy-man philosophy and even some romance, enough to plug the upper and lower gaps - as it were - while the work is done, just as in real life.We usually get updates on the life and interests of the very rich while we have our plebian representatives get the caper-job done. But why bother with more detail, when no-one is interested? Especially complicated detail.In our modern machine-age it is not unusual to find talented technicians who want to be more than just technicians, probably because that is the nature of the machine: they are designed to serve some greater end, a combustion engine with wheels for instance.Nolan is such a technician: a superbly articulate film director who wants to say more than simple moving images can say. But what does Nolan want to say? It's about life, that's for sure. Look at how he pulls life apart and then tries to put it back together again. Here in TENET he uses time, where elsewhere he uses robotics, for instance. And what does he discover here? Yes, the obvious and banal answer he has always discovered about human life: no one wants to die. And his solution? Generation, of course: what other solution do we have?I watch these films just to pass idle moments, but even so I would suggest for the future that Nolan gives up this fruitless search. What he should do instead is examine a subject better suited to his skill, that has been examined fruitfully by many like him: he should study love, not life. One thing he will learn: he will no longer need capers, busy-man philosophy or teenage romance - love goes by itself, answers for itself most fulsomely.The points are for the said skill, that and the skill of those who helped him here."
2845,Judt watch n enjoy it dont read reviews every one cant enjoy it .....nolan is G.O.A.T
2846,"It's as good as one expects from Christopher Nolan. Its fast, to the point, abstract and proper mind bending.There is no unwanted plot like individual development (they are already developed) or too much back story or romantic sub-plots. One has to just focus on what's going on, on the screen.A lot of people complain that there is not much 'character development'. These days everyone expects to see snail paced plots and dialogues for the sake of seeing how the characters develop and what life choices they make. It has become a big cliche to ask for such plots. One should be able to grasp a character as it is on screen. Too many slow and in-depth dialogues sometimes tend to ruin good movies.Some also complain it's loud. Its an action movie with guns firing, bombs exploding, and cars crashing. Obviously it will be loud. But can not be blamed as many expect to see super slow plots with 'character development'. It seems actual story and intensity does not matter these days. Any good paced story and people lose track. Guess what could be the reason?The only thing I felt wanting was an Interstellar level music score.The movie has great intensity, great performances and awesome locations. Everything is beautiful. They do explain the elements, the motives, the methods, and everything else. One just has to pay attention keep pace.In the end, Christopher Nolan is a REAL GENIUS."
2847,"I saw this back in September, when us Canadians were allowed to see it early (on time everywhere but the U.S. The plot is heavy, and requires your utmost attention, which ended up leaving me frustrated. Not because I'm a simpleton, but because we tend to need to be able to hear the plot to follow along, and that wasn't always the case.
I remember sitting there growing increasingly frustrated as the time travel/rewind elements took center stage and left me struggling to understand what the hell was happening. It all looked incredibly good, and on the surface seems to work, but trying to think HOW it all works takes away from watching it work. Without an audible plot, that doesn't work. By the end, I was over it and waiting for the credits. I don't typically leave a film, but I would have left this one if it wasn't the first film I'd seen in theaters in months.
I'm hoping that a rewatch at home with subtitles will help.
The positives are with the acting performances of most of the main cast. Elizabeth Debicki didn't have anything to work with, but I really, really enjoyed Robert Pattinson here.
So I dunno honestly, see it if you want but be prepared to be confused and maybe try to shut your brain off. That might help? Or it might make it work."
2848,"#OneWordReview #Tenet Unbelievable!
Christopher Nolan You're Genius! I never saw this level of confusing movie in my life. Your Imagination, Dedication, Direction, Screenplay makes this movie Masterpiece! This movie is pure, Pure Christopher Nolan Movie! Outstanding Writing, Unbelievable Concept, Superb action Scenes & Outstanding Execution. Every lead actor done a fabulous job. I love one thing that Dimpal Kapadia was also done superb work. I really wanted to see this movie again to understand deeply what Christopher really wanted to say! But for me this is the best movie which release in 2020."
2849,"Don't let the tagline of the review fool you, I really liked the film. It was utterly and completely confusing, but in a way that makes you want to keep watching. I love movies like this. I've seen similar concepts put on film, poorly. I've also seen a few that just blow your mind. Tenet is definitely a blow your mind one. Good job Mr. Nolan. Best one since Interstellar. I hope you find another good scifi concept to do. But as other reviewers have said, you need to watch it at least twice to get the whole point. I'll definitely be doing that."
2850,"I thought it's related time looping with new concept of inverse. Christopher Nolan given a Massive and Good experiece Movie. He's proved again a intelligence of filmmaking. In the middle of scene they came into the again airplane crash place to going present of time, i tottaly mind blowed what a scene man, i liked very much and the climax composition work, i was confused how to make this sequence, the Neil character scene how is used time traval portal i was surprised in the climax, but some dialogue didn't get dialougue are speedup sometimes, but christopher's nolan Movie must watch twice time then will be get know what exactly the Movie was and the sound effect and sound mixing how i feel in dunkirk and dark knight thier was same experienced in TENET Movie.I enjoyed very much in Theatre. Some scense are i didn't get answer why it happen and why it's not happened here in particular scene, may be will watch again will get the answer... I will be must watch in theatre again and the End of the Movie Christopher's Nolan give a confusion or hypothetical scene... I think i got that, the Neil character end scene to starting helping the protoganist through time... I don't know it was right... But i really ENJOYED AND EXPERIENCED THE MOVIE..."
2851,"Call it a masterpiece or give it a single star, the point is amidst all the puzzled pieces separated across time, I see the vision of Chris to bring it to reality, in a way only a great artist can. The antagonist and the protagonist are relatable to us in matters we can't imagine. We all have Andrei in us. He made a point by mentioning about the disappointment of future generationsfrom us, so much so that they have decided to reverse the time. We must open our eyes now to realize that the true essence of reality is not in one's own benfits, but the benfit of the combined holistic world (including nature). Coming back to movie, people who tell the score is too loud might be somewhat corrct, but I didn't feel it before I read their reviews, since I was so lost. I watched the first 2 hours twice before watching the ending half hour and I am super surprised by the originality of the movie. Christopher brings the nostalgia where he started with films like Memento and ending it with Tenet on higher notes. We see the things in reverse without wondering the extremely complicated shooting styles they used.Overall, it is worth watching if you have patience. It brings you to the reality where you feel you are protected by the future.After understanding this movie, movies on time travel and movies like Inception which generally follow linear forward moving timeline seem like a grandma's cheesecake!"
2852,"TENET has one of the greatest original screenplay ever. The detailing and amout of work put into this is fascinating.
But the story telling is just bad. What's the point if we can't understand what's happening?
It's like using shaky camera in action scenes. We get an idea how intense the fight is but we won't get to see who's hitting who.
That's what happens with TENET. Nolan got it right with Inception. Things were complicated but explained to us in the right way. The editing was precise so that we knew who's who and where's where.
TENET failed to do that."
2853,"I expected much more, this probably being the most anticipated pandemic release."
2854,"I've seen Tenet, Interstellar, Inception and The Prestige because I'm drawn to ""science fiction"" in general. Christopher Nolan's modus operandi is pretty clear at this point in my opinion: take a high level but perhaps difficult to work with concept and make THAT the film's MacGuffin. In other words, he's a sci-fi faker. The front and center concept is just an irrelevant plot device.In The Prestige, it was Tesla's absolutely world changing invention. In Inception it was the fantastical dream sharing device. In Interstellar it was all of human existence on the line. And in Tenet, it's time travel and an attack from our future generations. In all these cases we are presented with those amazing and limitless concepts and made to believe they are what the films are about. Uh, NO. In all cases it's obvious Christopher NOlan couldn't actually handle the concepts so he just dropped back into the safe zone and we get just a normal drama/thriller with a thin, fake sci-fi wrapper.Tenet is really simple, you go in a spinning thing and when you come out you're traveling the other direction through time. There is talk of reversing entropy, but it's physics gibberish and it's better to think you're just moving backwards through time. OK, awesome, the ideas we could cook up around this concept are massive. Again, NO, we just get an idiotic story about a guy who wants to end the world because he's dying. You could have just had his kill switch on some huge nuclear arsenal or a deadly virus sprinkled around the globe and left the time travel out of it. What a complete waste of time, hah.In reality the fights between people going forwards and backwards in time are pretty stupid. It makes far more sense to simply go backwards in time through the event but just observe, and then reverse again so you're going forward. Then you could know what will happen first-hand instead of relying on scarce intel.Also the oxygen masks and other feeble scientific explanations were idiotic and just further solidify my claim that Christopher NOlan has no grasp of the concepts he's leveraging to try to be cool. Even The Big Bang Theory did a better job of pretending they knew what they were talking about."
2855,"As expected nolan did something unexpected.
Washington rocks as the lead role invert fighting scenes were absolutely amazing kudous to hans zimmer for making such thrilling background music"
2856,"The movie is normal but story is unbelievable.
I give average rating because of its video content but 10 star for it's story."
2857,"Most of us need to watch again or rewind movie to understand some parts of the movie.
Movie idea is unique so points for that.
In the end we all would like to use time travel to fix some parts of life that went wrong."
2858,"This is Inception on steroids. Loved it. Only acting by main protagonist sholud've been better,they should cast someone better than lead actor.Story is great,directing phenomenal.A must see!"
2859,Another magical master piece by Christopher after interstellar
2860,"Its the only time i believe a movie could be better understandable as a mini-Series ...because you really don t have the time to digest and process the theory behind the action as fast as you may need.... the movie has everything a masterpiece need. Story, lyricism, plot, action, good acting and of course fulfillment...the interaction of the different timelines is very good designed and whoever wanted a film like this......have received exactly what he gained for..."
2861,"I think this movie was great. The idea was new, fresh & unique. Had some similarities to inception but still was quite unique.The story was good & it had some good twists.The bad reviews seem to be because of the poorly mixed sound which i agree with. I don't think the movie looses too much ratings just because of the sound though?Some really sensitive people here.As a whole I thought it was an excellent movie by the great Nolan!Thanks again for a great movie."
2862,"Sometimes I wish I could crawl inside the mind of Christopher Nolan and understand the way he sees the world (or time) Hands down, my favourite director!That being said... The plot was overcomplicated... The background music was too loud and dialogues were not audible... Not the best Nolan movie... But still a masterpiece!
Why?
Because I watched it twice."
2863,Absolute Master piece. Don't complain of not understanding storyline. It's like solving a puzzle
2864,"Yes, Mr Nolan is a master at making films as well as Interstellar Inception and even Dunkirk but is not for everyone to think a little to admire a filmaker of this size."
2865,"If you are wondering why there's so much of mixed reaction to the movie is becasue the movie is just such complex genius piece of art, that if you understand it, then it's one of the greatest movies you'll ever see, and if you won't then you'll too will be cursing Nolan that why has he made something too complex within 180 min to understand, there are some things which were not so Nolan like, for example sometimes it felt a little choppy, sometimes sometimes the dialouges were too cliché, I get it Nolan wanted to make a movie where his protagonist is a confident one, so not much of a problem, but in the end everything comes to this, if you get it you'll love it but if you don't then you won't. Simple."
2866,"We have envisioned a movie should be a certain way but what if it goes beyond what we think it should be, why dont we start understanding something great doesn't have to be something familiar!! The essence in this amazing movies is that you got watch it few times to understand the plot, storytelling and the awesome connection between characters and how everything is looped in, this makes the movie simply one of the best in recent time!"
2867,"This movie falls in my opinion somewhere between David Lynch's mullholand drive and momento, with inception's spices... And interstellar's awesomeness.... Can't get enough of this movie... Starts with action then confusion, then more confusion, then action then a car chase that is mind blowing and confusing.. Then more confusion, then the epic confusion of all confusion... U will understand this movie but you are always late in comprehension.... So good.. And Nolan's trick in having everything working in this movie in synchronize from acting... To soundtrack which is amazing and as epic as the this movie... Wooooooowww wow wow... I loved it!!!!"
2868,It's not inception or prestige but is good movie.very fast and you can't understand good the movie plot.is good and anyone must see this movie!
2869,Best movie of the pendemic year . It made my whole pendemic worthy
2870,"It is what it is! Amazing movie with HUGE messages in it!! Keep your eyes and mind open, and you will get it in the first play! I am speechless!"
2871,"Every cinema lover waits impatiently for Nolan's films, in order to live a wonderful cinematic experience, and Tenet was the exception under exceptional circumstances that the world is experiencing. Where the events of the film take place in a world of espionage where an agent is tested in order to carry out a very dangerous task, and indeed he succeeds in this test and begins his mission, which is to save the world from perdition, When you watch a Christopher Nolan movie, know that you will see a clear play of time and space with wonderful dialogues, creative action scenes especially with this movie. Overall Tenet is a great movie that's worth watching"
2872,"I remember people talking about Inception, before I even saw it, that it was sooo mind blowing, complicated, complex, I always got to appreciate the mind-blowing part of it all, but I always had a feeling it wasn't really that complex after all, and well... I think Tenet definitely proves that point, good Lord this movie is complex and complicated lol.I truly had to watch this twice, before writing or even grading this thing, don't get me wrong, after the first time, you can truly appreciate the action pieces, the acting, the directing, the score, the cinematography, and almost everything else, but I couldn't piece the story I just watched together in my mind, I just couldn't.But well, I can confirm that, the second watch actually adds a whole other layer to the experience, it's almost like you are watching a whole new movie, and at the end of the day, you truly have two distinct experiences, that are, in their own way, good.I love the mystery that you have throughout almost the entire movie, when you don't actually know what the hell is happening, you are thrown into this story from the jump, and they truly won't explain much of it all until mid-way through the movie, and somehow, I was still entertained by it.I loved most of the action here, the air plane scene is insane, and the fact they truly crashed a plain is unbelievable. The whole concept of Tenet, and how these people are in a way, forever connected in a looping of sorts, is fascinating. Some parts of it my head actually hurts, when I try to understand (like trying to piece together if the moves on the fight scenes with someone inverted, and the other not-inverted makes sense, or the car chases). But man, this movie is fascinating, and insanely well executed.Nolan is definitely following a trend with his recent films tho, and I can't say I hate it. With Dunkirk he fully went to a non-conventional storytelling, with multiple storylines, with only two acts, without really a protagonist, I loved the sense of passing the ""in a war, you don't really know stuff about the person besides you, and people die, all the time"" feeling of it, and I thought it worked to perfection.Here in Tenet, he does a similar thing, with having ""the protagonist"" without almost any background, and... well, he doesn't even have a name, is definitely a bold move, and I get the point that, in a way, it makes it hard for us to care about him, or even understand his motivation at times, but well, I don't think it really matters that much at the of the day, and it doesn't make me like the movie that much less. Sure, he could have at least given us something abut the character, but since almost everything around him works (his relationship with Neil, Kat's storyline with her kid, Sator's motivation, and even the concept of the future wanting to destroy us, in order to... use our resources?, they all work, you don't really have time to think about the protagonist that much - in fact, at first I didn't even really he didn't have a name).This is by far tho, the most niched of Nolan's films, when I saw Dunkirk I thought the same, but now... Dunkirk seems like a regular family friendly movie, this one has so many layers, and sure, it has those characteristic ""Nolan scenes"" where he explains a lot of what is going on to us, the audience, however, is the definitely one of his movies that has less of it.Anyways, I love the mystery, I love the acting, I love the different concepts, and that I can't even get my head around some of them, and the repercussions that it might have on the characters, and the surroundings. Like, for example, when someone goes to the past, and then reverts back, the only way ""back to the future"" is by... living in the past for all the specific time? Do they age the same tho? That's all fascinating and weird to wrap your head around, and I love it.John David Washington is so good here, and continues to show he's one of the biggest revelations over the past few years in Hollywood, with BlacKKKlansman, and now this. Robert Pattinson, man... I was wrong, sorry for doubting your acting skills, I can't wait to see what you do with Batman, that's it, I said it. Elizabeth Debicki is also great here. And Kenneth Branagh... well, he definitely went places here, and I loved it. Anyways, the cast is great, I love that we got a bit of my man Aaron Taylor-Johnson too, he's always a blast to watch, the acting is great all throughout, and I loved it.At the end of the day, one has to be insane to not appreciate, at least the technical aspect of it all, I saw a stat on the trivia session here, that the movie has as many CGI scenes as a regular rom-com... I mean, that's insane, this is an action-packed movie, with time travel, all the technical stuff, a war and the fact he can make all this stuff that's happening, feel so real, with as much practical effect as possible is just remarkable. Nolan is just one of the best directors working today, innovative, experimental, refreshing, bold."
2873,World-class if you contemplate it properly. It's going to be at the top of the list.
2874,There is no profit in America when your element is not RACISM. These reviews disgust the reader and the narrative is only profitable worldwide.GOOD JOB AMERICA. GOOD JOB.
2875,"First to get it off my chest. Not a ten for so widely complained about sound. Not possible to watch without sub-titles.
Second there are indeed movies with better plot, but the mix of action, visuals and good plot I have never seen before executed so perfectly. That for me set a new highest bar for an action movie.
People complaining about shallow characters are wrong, they are not shallow at all they are overwhelmed by the events far beyond their control or understanding. In fact they are surprisingly human in the face of the challenges. I hate when the character explores his childhood and first love scars, while he has to defuse a nuclear bomb, like some movies show, THAT is laughable.
The other complain, you have to see the movie twice, well that is an option, but it is your choice, not a directors. I re-winded it in my mind the whole evening finding new delights, your brain is your streamer.
And to get it off my chest, saying Interstellar with its disregard for science and deus ex machina is better movie cmon now."
2876,"Masterpiece best of christopher columbus man i fucking loved every bit of movie....just watch it
you won't be having words to describe how you feel after watching this"
2877,"It's great movieyou better watch ""tomorrow me, yesterday you""
nolan expand this movie based on that (i'd say).this is not your typical spy moviebesides hard-to-understand, but nolan-ish, the movie has great cast, good cinematography, but imho soundtrack is not that on best levelI watched all nolan movies, I thought he is just not that great, but after watching Tenet, I know for sure Nolan is one of the GOATi want to give 10/10, but since the concept already used in movie that I informed before, so I think 9.5/10 is fair enough.love Pattinson's role, I hope he just get his Oscar.sorry for broken english"
2878,"It's a Nolan movie alright.
he took filmmaking to a whole new other level, from fight scenes, explosions, visuals, score .... it can't get any better.
if Nolan didn't win best picture or best director for this, I don't know what will.
nobody, and I mean nobody can make movies like this man here.
I didn't understand it the first time, It kept me thinking for a couple of days, the second time things got clearer.
I saw some idiot who gave it 5 because ""it's too complicated"", that doesn't cover the visuals alone.
this movie is a must see (like a couple of times)"
2879,"If you want to the understand every intracacy of this movie, go ahead and watch it as many times as you need to. If you want to just get the general gist, pay attention and it all makes sense.Just like Inception, the way I understood it was there was a core mission, they had to go inside someone's head to change his mind about something before he died - everything was just esoteric technology that moved the plot along.This movies core mission is to prevent the annihilation of the world, by preventing the enacting of an algorithm from the future - everything else was just esoteric technolog that moved the plot along.Trying to understand how the technology works is where everyone is becoming unstuck - but understand the formula of a movie, there are good guys, there are bad guys and they fight and the good guys win. When you get that part, everything about this movie and every other ""intelligent"" movie will make sense"
2880,"Nolan never fails to amaze the heck out of us!Time has never been explored this way!Head-cracking physics concepts, spectacular action choreography, stunning IMAX visuals & skillful performances from all leads.So many complex elements but still narrated in a very clarified manner, thanks to Nolan's golden screenplay!Kudos to the editing team!A perfectly handled mixture of style & substance!💯A never before seen sci-fi espionage action thriller!💥"
2881,"Its great and too complex story that should explain it more but the hole story is wonderful.
The action since have not the quality that requierd"
2882,I know this movie i bit complicated but this is the real beauty of thus science fiction movie and show that the time reality is the most fundamental thing in this universe.
2883,"#MovieReview #Tenet #ChristopherNolan #SpoilerFreeThe most awaited film of the year did not disappoint. Tenet is the latest potboiler from master auteur Christopher Nolan and true to form is as mind-bending as it comes.The core concept of time-inversion caused many a headache but the thrills and spills guarantee an engaging watch.Spellbinding chase sequences, air-crashes and close-quarters combat, all choreographed to perfection makes for a terrific viewing experience.John David Washington is adequate as 'The Protagonist' while Robert Pattinson delivers another memorable performance as the mysterious 'Neil'.
Dimple Kapadia oozes gravitas in a short but impactful role in a movie that bears the unmistakeable Nolanesque aura.Highly Recommended. Pure Nolan-ness."
2884,"Tipical nolan tach, you can't anderstand in first time."
2885,"First the character- Nolan's movies never ever focussed on it ( except dark knight trilogy) or his movies would have been 5 hrs long so please shut up. The story/plot- not new but was very hard to execute and Nolan did it better than anyone could have imagined, if you think it is not well done, you are very welcome to try it. The soundtrack- now this is where the problem was, it seemed as if the mixing had been done in a hurry ( especially in the intro) since the music overshadowed the dialogues ( subtitles saved me lol), but still it is unique and great like it has always been. Cinematography- top notch, don't even argue. Acting/actors - not bad but could have been better. Verdict - it takes a lot of head to create such piece, too bad it will be bashed by "" Complexity loving audience "" for being "" Too complicated"", lmao."
2886,"I just want to say ""This should be seen on a large screen"""
2887,"I was not able to understand everything in this movie first, I had to give it 24 hours in my head. I can tell you one thing, if you are giving less that 8 stars to this movie, you have to accept that it's not the movie, it's you. The situation is the following. This movie outperforms a lot of others in sci-fi category and in action category. Also considering the well-built story, the shoots, the environments, the fighting scenes and the actor's performance this makes it a 10.You want to watch it believe me."
2888,"Tenet tells the story of the Protagonist(John David Washington). With only one word, 'Tenet', to connect the dots, the Protagonist travels through a world of arms dealers & terrorists, to save the world from a potential third World War. This mission will take place, beyond the regular norms of time and space.Tenet is an awe-inspiring movie. It will leave you absolutely gobsmacked, from start to finish. You need to pay very close attention, to grasp & carefully understand the multitude of details & concepts explained to you, during the course of the film. Writer-director Christopher Nolan strikes gold, yet again! Tenet definitely warrants multiple viewings. The action set pieces are eye-popping. The inversion scenes are edge of the seat, non-stop action-packed thrill rides & they're the highlight of the movie. The background score by Ludwig Goransson is epic. The cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema is breathtakingly beautiful. All the locales around the world, have been captured perfectly. John David Washington is spectacular as the Protagonist. Robert Pattinson is outstanding as Neil. Elizabeth Debicki is fantastic as Kat. Kenneth Branagh is unforgettable as Sator. Dimple Kapadia is brilliant as Priya. Himesh Patel is awesome as Mahir. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is superb as Ives. The supporting cast is great. Tenet is a must watch in theatres, preferably in IMAX. Go & feel the joy of watching movies on the big screen again, in the midst of this nightmarish pandemic. Can't wait to watch it again & again!"
2889,"Okay, it's a concept/plot heavy film than the dramatic ones that generally comes with emotional background touch. Certainly not a cup of coffee for everyone.
The detailing is superb. Yup, it's a slow burn. Wait for the climax. It's certainly gonna pay you off.
Cinematography & Editing OMG..... haven't seen anything quite like this.
J.D Washington & Kenneth Branagh are good in their respective roles.
Show stealer offcourse Robert Pattinson & Elizabeth Debicki.
BGM is superb always makes you concern about what happening in the screen.
Yup it's the most confusing movie of Nolan, I had felt too, much than Inception. So pls watch every detail, what's happening inorder to follow the screenplay.Christopher Nolan ... another's masterclass. This film gonna age very well, because I think it's way ahead than its time.Not certainly his best, but surely one of his finest."
2890,"The great Christopher Nolan latest film tells about Grandfather Paradox, full of unnoticeable clues throughout every screen, confusing events and mindblowing plot.Non-linear plot has been a basic formula for Nolan himself when it comes to filmmaking. The great scoring with shepard tone is also always his favorite part when working with great composer.This masterpiece's scoring was composed by Ludwig Göransson instead of Hans Zimmer but everything feels all right.
This motion picture is as confusing as how it is supposed to be though it has great script and non anticlimactic story.The build up does not feel to tell the audience about what's going on also the direction is intense in every single scene even with lack of details throughout the film that bothers the audience. It should be watched more than once to make up audience's mind and in order to understanding the plot. ""Preventing World War 3"" part does not really catch audience's attention in my opinion because we only wonder the motive behind every character does.It is Sci-Fi titled but reversion and time travel are captured realistically better than any movies that have done the common formula. Compared to Inception (2010), this one has bigger damage to your brain after seeing this."
2891,Chris and I are on the same wavelength. His personal struggle with understanding life is in all these movies he makes and each one is a masterpiece in its own way. He immortalizes concepts lost in time. Thank you Chris for shedding a little bit of light in a darkened world.
2892,Tenet is a thrill ride from beginning to end. The action is unreal and the characters are unique. The score is very well fitting and compliments the movie well. Definitely needs more than one viewing to understand but my first time was still an awesome experience. 10/10
2893,"It's not aweeeersome ! Just good as it not only entertains but as sci-fi does, it give fans chance to feel smart than they actually are"
2894,Another Masterpiece from the director christopher nolan
2895,"Going in to watch this movie,I was prepared to dump reality at the doorstep(like you should in most of Nolan's movies).This is a movie that requires your undivided attention whilst watching,for you to even partially comprehend the details of it.I recommend multiple watches on this movie because the more you watch it,the better you'd understand and appreciate it for the masterpiece it is."
2896,"First half could have been better..
Little drama will takes the first half and direct travel with no start point"
2897,"No, seriously! I don't think there is any writer/director who can produce films that feel out of place and in a great way. The movie does not make up for a popcorn flick which explains a lot of bad reviews. But a second run at it with subtitles and a hellofalot attention, this movie is heaven for any sci-fi lover. I could draw some parallel with Dan Brown's Inferno and if you've read the book, you'll know what I am speaking of. The only bad thing about this movie was David Washington, a product of nepotism. Terrible one dimensional actor. But I still rated this movie a ten because if not for casting a star kid, I would have rated it an eleven."
2898,"It has finally happened. Christopher Nolan has pushed me, a longtime admirer and irate apologist, over the edge. This madman cannot expect me to develop superhuman hearing just to discern his incredibly complicated, armchair temporal physics theory exposition over Ludwig Göransson's droning base. That's 80% of the film!Top marks for spectacle, medium marks for suaveness, low marks for pacing. Nolan's films usually go at a breakneck pace, but with a new editor working on this one I think Chris' worst impulses were indulged a bit too much. The film never allows itself to breathe, which for a film that revels in exposition should be impossible. The reason is that only Elizabeth Debicki's character is provided any screen time just to convey her character's state of mind, and even then that time is precious little. Another is that the film doesn't indulge in its travelogue elements; the audience is transported to about six different countries and barely gets a sense for any of them. Such an error is inexcusable for a filmmaker obsessed with the old-fashioned extravagance of Bond films and David Lean. If you don't have character, you should at least have immersion.And who keeps letting Kenneth Branagh do accents?!"
2899,"The movie is really beautifull at all . Action is perfect and nice maybe best in 2020 . Awesome explotions and very good locations . Music 10 of 10 and sound's is good . Actors fine ... .
That was goodness, now problems .
The charactrization is not so good ,in the movie says no need to understand just feel but i coudn't feel as i should .
Characterization could be better than this . We don't really make sense with the protagonist as movie want and its annoying . There was questions was not answerd and some others storyline cavity's . I think the main attention was on action's and that was so great .
But we had more expection of movie cuz nolan was director .
My opinion is Tenet is a great movie but not a masterpiece like inseption or dark knight or other nolan's movies and main problem is characterization what is not so bad but we expect nolan more . I really liked that and enjoyed . Maybe to make sense with movie you have to watch it twice cuz story is a little complicated and blow the brain what is all nolan's movie are and its awesome .
9/10"
2900,"Just joking, you obviously understand the movie even in the first watch but you need to adapt...
This is why you leave the theater with a bad headache and alot of questions.
But probably watching it twice will be like a walk in the park.
Cheers..."
2901,"Teh bes film, Nolan the best human
Best movie, vashangton the best actor"
2902,It was an absolute masterpiece. It's been so long since the last time I enjoyed a movie that much. I can't understand some people rating it 1 star. Just watch it again and I'm sure you regret your rating.
2903,"The message of this movie needs more recognition. And as most of Nolan's movies, you have to watch it more than once if you don't get it at the first time. The climax was beautifull and had depth."
2904,"Awesome, I never seen this type of movie befor. I have no word to explan this movie."
2905,"It is a little bit confusing, but if you pay your full attention it is a masterpiece. Most of the people are saying they can't understand it but I did on a first watch.
Totally different action scenes that I have never seen.
A little bit boring at the middle just like inception.
But it is worth a watch."
2906,"The average normal audience would have difficulty to get the point, so you have to watch it again and again, we are not scientist so we can understand all this theory about phisics.. Anyhow it's dizzy confusing, and required your full attention, even though at the end you probably will say ""aha.. Okayyyy"""
2907,"Tenet is what you'd think a quintessential Nolan Film should be ; A mind-bendingly layered High-concept with complex and thrilling set pieces. A plot that will take hold of you and excerpt every drop of your brain and attention, but with that comes sacrifice. There's very little heart to this, whatever emotional substance it has is unevenly spread too thin. Still, Tenet delivers enough high-powered thrills to cover for the near-desolate visceral impact."
2908,"You will have to watch this movie more than once to understand what's going on. Think Inception on steroids. There is time travel forwards and backwards at the same time. It is bizarre, but very different than anything anyone else has done. The cast is great, very well done. Don't just watch it and think you get it. You don't. Watch it again. Look at the ratings of Inception. This will also eventually be a cult favorite."
2909,"Nolan tries too hard. I like complexity in movies but this movie goes bananas in a bad way. Normally i would see a movie twice to see if I missed something but I will skip this one. John David Washingtons swag style is annoying. Maby in KKKlansman, but not in this. 3 stars for the cinematography."
2910,"The idea was that when entropy is reversed, time runs backwards.
This idea is wrong. If you reverse the entropy of a human being, then
this person simply gets younger with the time, as in the film
""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"".
Because of the length, I was bored by the film."
2911,"From a conceptual and audiovisual standpoint, this film is a daring and immaculate achievement - as can be expected. However, the characters are so dull - many of them serve simply as exposition mouthpieces, and their motivations/goals remain obscure. As a result, the movie feels emotionally cold and dull, and the already hard-to-follow narrative becomes near-impossible to connect with and care about."
2912,"I'm definitely a Christopher Nolan fanboy, ""The Prestige"" is my 2nd favourite film of all time (after ""Brazil""), and I've loved all his films on multiple levels, that is, until this one.It has all the makings of a great Nolan film, all the ingredients, but the story is so narratively ambitious that it forces way too much of the dialogue in exposition trying to explain itself. Any movie I've seen that falls into this trap messes with my suspension of disbelief because a story that is mainly about explaining itself is the very opposite of realism.Along with this, the characters become more like the chorus of a Greek play and much harder to be engaged by emotionally, and if that doesn't happen it's darn near impossible to care about the characters or what happens to them, leading to disengagement from the film altogether.I would still call this a brilliant and exceptional film, and I love undoing the straps of puzzles Nolan builds around his big reveal of his films generally, but again this story was just too ambitious for my mind to keep up with, or maybe I wasn't compelled or persuaded enough to bother. Again, overly-talky pictures that spend out of necessity not just a large portion, but the majority of the dialogue explaining what is going on is very 1980s primetime soap-opera-ish.I can see where a very good idea for a story, just a kernel, could be build upon and only when so much time and craft have been invested does a fatal flaw emerge, and dialogue is a handy tool for trying to paper over those fatal flaws, but we sacrifice getting to know characters as a result.One thing ""Tenet"" did for me was show me how quickly and organically I made emotional attachments to characters in other Nolan films, all without much set up as far as personal history or background or the other tools used to draw a viewer to being invested what happens to them. In the aforementioned ""The Prestige"" I felt bonds and understands with each of the characters very quickly in a way I just try as I might could not with the characters in this film.And as another point of comparison, ""The Prestige"" held a great mystery with all the clues available right to the end as to whether it was primarily a period piece about rivalry and envy, or a fantasy film. With that film Nolan trusted the audience enough to be able to follow along through some pretty quick twists, as he does in all his previous films, and by ratcheting up the abstract nature of the plot while simultaneously dumbing down the narrative by having that excess of exposition, as if to try spoon feeding the audience the philosophical subtleties of a Dostoyevsky novel, the complexity literally doesn't translate into language well in the setting of a film.I'd actually loved to have read ""Tenet"" as a novel as it's just one of those rare ideas that may just be too big to be effective in the relatively small bounds of a movie. I feel a bit the traitor for not enjoying too much one of those directors whose upcoming work I wait on anxiously, but despite having all the right ingredients this was just more ambitious than cinema or the cinema goer can handle."
2913,"The film is tooo complicated for normal audience.
I have watched predestination and i could understand it from first time but tenet i watched it two times now and still not 100% sure about the plot"
2914,"Of all the movies I have seen, Interstellar is my favorite. So, understandably, when I heard Christopher Nolan was producing another movie, I was immediately interested in what I thought would a thought-provoking, original movie from him. Well, it turns out that this movie wasn't any of that. It's a decent movie, it has solid characters and very good acting, but it also has very weird dialogues and the main plot of the movie is in itself very flawed. It's like always having this feeling that something in the story is off, because in fact it really doesn't make much sense. Its a movie that tries to be smart, but in reality, its quite dumb. And thats exactly why I think it deserves a 7: very good idea, bad execution, but still what I think is a good time."
2915,"I really like the idea but it lacks something. Maybe I expected too much as it's a Nolan film. I found second half better as things have gotten more meaningful, faster and ideas better presented towards the end. Really interesting movie. The only things I hate are the constant music bleeding my ears and Kenneth Branagh trying to pull Russian accent."
2916,"Visually very good, great acting but............story is very complex,viewer has to use both sides of the brain to unravel , definitely not a movie to chill with you need to be switched on to get an understanding of the movie"
2917,"The crew, actors who have done TENET most have been chosen with an IQ higher than average just to comprehend and do their job. They surly have chosen great locations, good actors but plot and conversation makes you feel lost. I give 5 stars to production (except sound mixing people) and to actors who understood the story enough to play it."
2918,There are only 10 stars available in Imdb . I would have given it 100 stars
2919,50% of the people will understand the movie if they watch in Nolan's way. And the remaining half will understand in the 1st go and term it as an MASTERPIECE.
2920,"Perfectly done spy thriller based on time inversion concept. A worthy successor to inception....infact its bit more puzzling than inception. Amazing cast, cinematography and score."
2921,"Did you enjoy watching Interstellar, Inception, The great Gatsby, Fight Club, V for Vendetta, The Matrix trilogy, or even movies like Bird Box or Escape Room? Then this UNIQUE movie is for you!The movie is complex, the sounding is in some scenes very annoying and if you don't like to focus during a movie, watch your phone during the film, or always goes to the bathroom because you tend to buy the largest soda your cinema has to offer, then this is not for you! The casting is beyond perfect, David and Robert were impressive, and the legendary Christopher Nolan has delivered once again.The movie's concept is very, very cliché. One man needs to save the world, there's a girl - there is always a girl - who makes everything more complicated, always more complicated. There's a big bad Russian oligarch, he's Russian what did you think? And you can maybe guess the rest, or probably not...David gets recruited after a heroic act early in the movie, to be the person that can help stop this Russian man from destroying every thing we cherish. It is not a Nolan movie if it does not get complicated. What people are moaning about in the reviews all over the world is that the time traveling concept is too hard to gasp. Well, let me tell you this, if time travel was easy to explain, and easy to do, then we would have done it in real life as well. I'm sure that almost everyone in the world have seen a time traveling movie of some sort, please can you name one movie that actually uses the laws of the physics to describe this phenomenon to make it as ""real"" as possible (Interstellar is an exception) such as Nolan does? Movies have, since the beginning of cinema, painted a reality before where someone can go back in time. We have seen portals, time machines and other ways to do it, but here, this film stands out among all the mainstreamers. Nolan uses the physical laws of time inversion where entropy is the central concept where instead of a person being transported through time, an object of a special precious metal is transported instead, and the person follows the backward energy, let me explain.I think the following explanation of the concept of entropy is what these critical reviewers would have wanted in the film to understand
Entropy is a physical concept that determines the very movement of that energy redemption between two or more objects. See it as ice cream and temperature, if you eat ice cream in the North Pole, the ice cream will not melt by the ambient temperature. But if you are in a hot country, the ice cream will melt due to the high temperature. In the heat, the ice cream melts and cannot return to its previous form because entropy (energy from the transformed form) cannot decrease naturally from the same source of resources, however, the melted ice cream can be converted to ice cream if you take it to the North Pole, sort of. In the film, they can thus go backwards with entropy, which creates this time inversion. So you are involved in the same movement and power and theoretically your body mass is moved through time, this is practically not possible. If this was possible, as it is in the movie, then you can act fairly normal while the rest of the world goes backwards. So it's wrong with your bodily movement, not the world's. The world is still in the center, the weather, the climate, gravity and other factors are still there, but instead of feeling the wind in your face, you now move backwards in the energy, which makes you feel like you are always going downwind. That is why, in the final scene, half of the soldiers in blue, fight in real time and in real motion because that was their reality but also the worlds since they did not time travel, while the red team had ""transported"" themselves and got to experience and fight the battle backwards. The red team goes out to fight in an entropy (backwards) and the blue time in the present time (now). What also confuses these reviewers is how these people who use these portals can be sure that they themselves in the future or in the past have used the portals. This is where the grandfather paradox comes into play. To make it simple for you, you simply do not know when, how or why it happened, it just did. Did the chicken or the egg come out first? It's the same principle, some things have no explanation and so is the reality. The fact that Nolan exploits this paradox and real physical laws to paint a time portal is outstanding. It gives an insight into how dedicated this fantastic director is to changing the film industry. Some of us just can not understand it yet, maybe our future self will come to explain it to us, who knows."
2922,"It's a movie that will leave you with a paradox
You understood everything and at the same time you understood nothing"
2923,"Wow, having just watched this, I feel like I have just had some seriously strong psilocybin - this movie is either going to wow you or you are going to absolutely hate it, but whatever your view its certainly not a ""seen it all before"" movie and not one that can be taken lightly.Tenet is such a truly mind bending experience, I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it and as stupid as it sounds, I'm not even sure I understand it fully myself and sort of torn between giving it a 2/10 or a 9/10.If you're sick of endless sequels, reimagines, remakes and fed up of yet more comic book/superheroes polluting your screen - give it a go, John David Washington & Robert Pattinson are both fantastic, the movie will warp your brain, its fast paced and some of the action sequences are quite simply stunning - its complicated, complex and confusing but its unique - I really have missed unique so its a 9, it left me completely and utterly exhausted. I can't promise you'll like or even understand it, but its certainly not just another 'meh' movie."
2924,"At this stage you either enjoy or just really hate Christopher Nolan movies. If you hate them, why bother watching? I love them and after watching this twice I'm even more confused which is fine. Everything doesn't have to be a linear A to B and only one outcome.Excellent casting throughout as well!"
2925,"Masterpiece! ""Nolan"" remember the name this type of director born once in a century. Literally no one can defeat the vision of this director."
2926,"Dear Mr Nolan,
This movie is the best save world movie like your best space movie, Batman movie, dreams movie and magic movie but your war movie not the best
So please keep making such masterpieces and save the world of movies"
2927,"The kind of concepts brought in it is not for the 'faint of mind'.
The 'powers' were interesting.. to think I'd punch you - I would have to think about what happens after punching.
Although it doesn't necessarily makes sense even with the dialogues on the first view, you'd have to belief they make sense."
2928,"Outstanding piece of work by Christopher Nolan wouldn't expect nothing less as he is one of the best directors of all time.The movie can be a little hard to understand at first but once you start paying close attention to everything that is happening it begins to make a lot of sense, the acting and the visuals are on point from start to end. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking to get something different from a movie, and not just a plain time travel movie with the same plot this is totally something epic and different."
2929,"For me it's not a masterpiece.why we consider the film a masterpiece because of their good editing, storytelling, directions, cinematography etc,but in TENET Direction is good, Cinematography is Mind blowing,only the sound mixing is loud and storytelling is lit bit weak..I think...I may be wrong,but this is my observation that I tell you.overall you can enjoy this movie,but don't compared this movie with others Nolan movie like Inception."
2930,"A masterpiece.
Watched it twice to fully understand the movie."
2931,"Not a dark knight,not a interstaller but is succesded"
2932,Mind goes beyond everyone should watch these.and such a new imagination and neew era of film great work..
2933,Most complex sci-fi movie ever.. people don't understand it because the science is kept real (theoretically) and it's not easy. Other sci-fi movies change the science and make it simpler to understand but nolan doesn't do that.. You need a sharp mind to understand this movie..
2934,"I felt a certain difficulty in identifying myself with the characters in the film. They all belong to unreachable classes of society, so I soon felt that nothing bad would happen to them, unlike what I felt in other Nolan films like Interstellar."
2935,Well you need to understand it actually. Another Nolan Classic
2936,"It's like Nolan is upset that some people understood what he was trying to do, so he makes things more and more complex until he is sure no one does understand. This film is about a very skilled and motivated special agent - think James Bond on steroids - who gets recruited to fight in a temporal war. The technology has been created to reverse the flow of entropy, which means objects and people can be made to travel backwards in time, and by that I mean literally just do things in reverse, not teleport in time, while the rest of the world goes in the normal direction. It's an intriguing concept that generates a storyline so complex that it can't be understood from just a viewing.So the question is: is this movie good enough to warrant multiple viewings, so that people can grasp the intricacies of time travel and of Nolan's twisted mind? And for me the answer is no. I have no idea where are the logic holes in the plot and frankly I don't care, and that for a very simple reason: I couldn't relate to any character, except perhaps Robert Pattinson's. The special agent that fights for the world, who has no history or personal life, a ""protagonist"" bought wholesale from a shelf, is boring as a person and as a character. The amazingly beautiful woman who is the object of interest for both hero and villain, for no good reason other than she's hot, whose motivation is solely related to her son and her own selfish emotions, to the point where she risks the existence of the world on ""not letting him feel he won"", is almost as disgusting if not more as the villain. Everyone else is just a pawn, acting as such, with a few scenes each in Nolan's extensive plot.Another issue with the film is the pace. Having worked so much on the plot, I guess it was a chore to compress it all to the size of a film. And even so it was two ours and a half long. This would have been much better served by a miniseries. As such, it felt rushed with details that you had to think through while other fast paced scenes were flooding in.It was a very carefully crafted film, which makes it well above average, but it failed at the basics: characterization and pace. Perhaps I will think about it some more and manage to enjoy the genius in it, but after just having watched it, I just feel tired and glad it's over."
2937,"The exposition dump is fast and if you're not focused completely, things will get confusing fast.
The film is dense but easy to follow if you but focus. Most complaints apparently did not. It's confusing in the first half or 2/3rds but completely clears up towards the end. Confusing not because it's hard to understand but because it was meant to be this way. People getting upset over it is funny.
I'm actually interested in viewing the film completely in reverse just for the spectacle of it.
The movie portrays time travel like i've never seen before and it makes it actually seem plausible. In my opinion Nolan completely outdone himself this time."
2938,Nolan is no doubt best one storyteller. This time seems a little bit lacking. Music could've been more great but hans Zimmer is the best option for Nolan's movies
2939,"Christopher Nolan has outdone himself once again. Plot is confusing and amazing at the same time but everything will come together as the movie goes forward. It had my attention throughout the movie.
If you don't understand it then you haven't paid enough attention because things are explained you just need to attentive to pick it up"
2940,"All I have to say is...
Director: Christopher Nolan
Writer: Christopher NolanReally made my day!"
2941,There must be a genre named after Nolan so everyone can be prepared to get their mind fcked again nd again
2942,"And it got fugged slowly.
I'm still in doubt what to find of this movie.
Do I like it? Do I hate it? Still not sure.I'll give it a second watch since this is really needed to understand all the quirks in the storyline.
What were the writers thinking? No one will ever know I'm afraid."
2943,"""Tenet"" is a Sci-Fi - Action movie in which we watch a man fighting to save the entire world from destruction. Real time is something relevant and everything can change when you play with it but it's very important who is in control of it and who is not.I have to admit that I was expecting this movie and I had high expectation by it. For one more time Christopher Nolan changes everything and makes us think about many different aspects of life. He succeeded on making us talk, discuss and think of his movie for a long time since we watched it. I believe that Christopher Nolan for one more time did an excellent job on both direction and writing. The interpretations of both John David Washington who played as Protagonist and Robert Pattinson who played as Neil were simply amazing and they both did a great job. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Clémence Poésy's who played as Barbara, Kenneth Branagh's who played as Sator and Michael Caine's who played as Crosby. Finally, I have to say that ""Tenet"" is an amazing movie and if you are a fan of Christopher Nolan's movies and especially of ""Memento"" and ""Inception"" then I am sure that you will consider it as a masterpiece, but even if you are not I believe that you will enjoy it too."
2944,"Should have been a mini series , scenes are over before they started no character building... I could go on and on"
2945,This will be better if they make it more simple not everyone have master degree in physics or science i don't get it and beside there was no much creative or writing the script just look more a like inception movie so just not worth all hours to watch it waste of time if u want to watch it just watch inception much better
2946,"A lot is not explained but as you watch, more and more uncovers and the director gives you pieces of info through the movie to remember and recall later. It's a very intricate movie and concept and I see how many will not get it and hate the movie. I suspect, one the fake rating fall the real rating will settle around 6.5, that's when the masses will watch and then real hate will start. If YOU didn't like it, before you rate it low, try to watch it again. Hard to compare it to any other movie, but Inception was a bit complicated,but this is way more.
It's loud, beautifully shot,great camerawork. Script could've been a bit better in some areas. The end has a few sound issues ( you'll know what I mean when you watch it). I mainly had issues with the story that could've better explained things.
There was a lot of"" oh that's why I saw this before..."" yet I felt didn't make sense 100%. I get it, time travel is complicated and they just proved it
7.5/10"
2947,Good movie to watch for this is nolan's talent the movie has good storyline and delivers a great message.
2948,"The biggest drawback, the screenwriter / director did not give a damn about creating a connection between the heroine and the hero. even in comics it is more spelled out."
2949,"I'm not saying this was a bad film by any means, however I feel that Nolan went so far with his style of confusing the viewer that Tenet became more tedious than impressive, the action, soundtrack and concept where great however."
2950,"I'm big fan of sci-fi, but I hate when movies violate established physics - and this movie is one big violation. Sci-fi should expand and extend upon established physics while ideally still making scientific sense - otherwise it's just bloody fantasy.Luckily acting, action and special effects are great which pull the bar quite a bit, but from writing perspective - this is probably worst Nolan's take by miles."
2951,"The movie is very interesting, and the concept has me wanting to watch it again. When I first started the movie, I was lost. Thirty minutes later, I was lost, an hour later, I was lost. Then all of a sudden, the movie starts to make sense and you wish you could rewind.The acting was incredible, I'm not used to seeing Robert Pattinson or John David Washington in a role such as this and they did an incredible job. I was equally impressed with Elizabeth Debicki, I've seen her in a few roles such as Guardians of the Galaxy and I think she's beautiful. Now I realize she is equally talented.This action thriller will take you on the ride of your life, similar to the like of Memento and Inception (both also by Nolan) or The Matrix. From the start of the movie, you're in a puzzle and your mind is playing tricks on you to the likes of ""Gheto Boys"". LOLThe movie has enough action to keep your sound system up and running, but the mind game is where its really at. While I have a lot to say about the movie, I can't provide spoilers and will leave my opinion at ""wow what a ride, can't wait to watch it again"".Bravo Nolan for creating a high quality movie that leaves you thinking."
2952,"Good Sci Fi movie with tons of actions. do not bother with the physics, it might melt your brain. chill and enjoy."
2953,"Above 8
Excellent action
Twisted plot
Perfect i say.
Athre Nolan film"
2954,"This movie makes the matrix look like a cartoon.....you have to look at it with no distractions....nolan's mind is either amazing or he isn't telling us something about the world when it comes to reality....this movie ,to me, is possibly realistic ...this is a movie for the nerds of time travel not the back the future kids....so put your thinking cap on when you watch it because you are in for one of the best movies you have ever seen"
2955,"It's a great movie, need full concentration of ones to understand it. I think it's only 7.8 till now because it's to much too grasp at one instant by normal people, But a great joy for a great mind."
2956,"Okay I watched this in the cinema and caught glimpses of dialogue which gave a partial understanding. Watched it again with subtitles on, completely different movie, so much more enjoyable understanding what's going, you still need to pay attention but so much more enjoyable!!"
2957,He always pushes his movies to the limit adding the ability to rewatch his movies gathering easter eggs and enjoy his movies to the limit. JUST WAAAATCH IT
2958,"Best movie of all time in my honest opinion, from the core idea to the ending of the movie, people will need to watch it twice to figure it out. I just finished watching it and i unintentionally clapped at the end. WOW!"
2959,I loved this film from the cinematography to the crazy confusing plot all through out my tiny little brain was sat there thinking how does Christopher Nolan pull it off time an time again and all though this very much flopped at the box office it is not because the film is bad it is a case of that it was released in a global pandemic for one of the first films to come out after months of none it is extremely good and up to the standard of many others . The acting is great and the cast choices interesting but the true highlight of this film is the plot you just need to see it to believe it
2960,"Those were the words from my wife as she came back halfway through the film, which basically is a full length feature at that point. My exact response was ""I don't know."" Not trying to be funny or sarcastic, but I truly was still trying to figure out what I was watching.I always thought I was the more sophisticated movie viewer and could easily grasp complex concepts thrown at me through the big screen. This movie was the ultimate test for that. If there was an Oscar award category for movies made to intentionally confuse you, then this would have won by miles. There is just so much happening so fast during the complex scenes that you will surely miss most of the details through the first watch. This movie warrants at least 3 watches to really catch all the plot. And even then I had to Google the explanation for the ending.It's a masterpiece of complexity as other reviewers may have mentioned. And if that's up your alley, then it's a must watch. If you would rather mindlessly stare at non-stop action, then you may want to skip this."
2961,"This is a 150 min puzzle not an ordinary film. If you want to solve the puzzle watch it twice, with subtitles and do a time map. Good luck!"
2962,"This was my first comment:""I´ve just watched Tenet and, honestly, I don´t know yet if I can say I liked it. By the end, I started to develop better impressions. However, I found it a little bit confusing from the beginning to the half of it. I guess I need to watch it at least once more to come to a clear conclusion. Anyway, it was pretty entertaining.""My new comment:FANTASTIC ! You really have to watch it at least twice and it is also true that subtitles may help to understand the complex parts, especially when the dialogues involves theories of physics. Above all, the tip is watching it more than once. I´ve never faced such a challenge like this movie posits before. The script is really brilliant ! One of the best movies I´ve ever seen in my entire life !"
2963,"Action galore! Bullets, bombs, car chases, and hand-to-hand combat would make this an action-movie lovers' dream. The problem...this film is incredibly hard to follow. The ""time travel"" aspect, which was really ""inverted time"" or moving in reverse, was an interesting plot but the movie was very convoluted. That, in and of itself, wouldn't have been too bad if you could have understood what was being said. Between the heavy accents, fast pace, and conversations through their military gear/masks, you can only grasp about 30% to 40% of the dialogue, and the verbal communication is key to understanding what the heck is going on. That being said, the acting was impeccable. This is the type of film you'd typically want to rewatch to catch everything you missed the first go-around but honestly, with the manic script, frenzied editing, many plot holes, and dialogue problems, I'm not sure I'd bother. Tenet is no Inception or Memento, IMHO but if you do decide to check it out, I highly recommend using subtitles, which might help you enjoy this flick more than I did. 2.2 stars Nov2020"
2964,"Christopher Nolan certainly knows how to experiment. The interesting thing though is that when it comes to most experimental films, they tend to fall into the category of arthouse, and if they are lucky, they will become cult classics. Not so with Nolan - he makes block busters, while experimenting at the same time, as is the case with this film. Then again, I also suspect that he has the finances that are able to produce films such as this one, and with a steady stream of blockbusters under his belt, we can expect more into the future.Some have suggested that this is a time travel film, and well, it really isn't. It actually has more to do with time inversion, namely that you are able to reverse time, and then travel back to certain points in the past, and then reverse it again. Initially it seems that it only applies to objects, that is until you go deeper into the film and find out what is actually going on.Yeah, Nolan certainly has a gift of suddenly changing the tempo at a moment's notice, and this definitely happens about halfway through the film. Also, you will see things happening, and even events being mentioned, that make no sense until you get to the end. In fact, it is one of those films that you really need to watch a second time to actually pick up on a lot of things that are going on, and have a much better understanding of how brilliant the concept is.Some have suggested that it is like Memento, in that it finishes halfway through, but no, that is not the case. As I mentioned, it is about time inversion, and while there are comments that they are only halfway through the mission, there is a good reason for this, and also you probably don't want to be board with the protagonist going around setting everything up.While the protagonist is good, Neil is even better, namely because there is so much going on with that character, particularly when it becomes clear that these two characters are working on different timelines, something that isn't made clear until the end, but upon watching a second time becomes pretty clear. As I said, this movie needs to be watched more than once to really understand how good it actually is (and it is probably a great way of doubling the cinematic take as well).Honestly, I really do love how Nolan experiments with time in his movies, even in a movie like Dunkirk, where things are happening that you have no idea why, until you get to the end of the film and it all suddenly makes sense. This one goes to a completely different level though, with multiple characters operating on multiple time lines, with things being set up in the background that you simply cannot see, but becomes pretty clear the second time round. Yes, this is definitely another one of his masterpieces."
2965,"An organisation seeks to hinder the plans of an Oligarch who has found a way to intertwine the annihilation of all humanity - future, present and past - with his own existence. To succeed they must exploit the concept of time inversion to foil his attempts to attain the technology that enables his god-like endeavour. But first they have to get close to him and figure out how and why he wants to ignite the war to end all wars.Caveat; Unlike other reviews I don't plan to take take issue with the artists technical choices; volume of soundtrack, clarity of dialogue etc. I respect the opinion of other reviewers, people's varying sensibilities, individuals ability to comprehend accents, and so on.Let's get a few answers out of the way because time is precious.Is Christopher Nolan's TENET any good? YES, it is.It is, in my opinion, an astounding piece of cinema and I think all involved should be very proud of what they've been able to deliver. It really is a very original take on the possibilities, pitfalls and dangers inherent in the idea of time travel. It also fits well into the Directors continuing cannon of work.Is it an easy movie to understand? NO, not from an initial viewing. You definitely will come out of the cinema thinking blimey, that's a plateful.If this were a book you'd have to put it down more than a few times to think through chapter by chapter. But alas this is a movie in a cinema so it's a bit like gorging a seven course meal with no break from one course to the next. It could make your stomach hurt; hence many of the mixed reviews.The difficulty in understanding the movie is, I would suggest, less about the construction of the film and more about how complex the ideas in the movie are to grasp, especially when you get to the details. There's plenty of exposition to try and help us along but still - big curly ideas are what they are!TENET does warrant more than one viewing but it's so well put together that you'll want to see it again. It visually stunning. My favourite close thematic precedents would include the Spierig Brothers Predestination with Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook (I really like that film), and Primer (2004); but TENET really does amp up the whole time travel paradox theme into blockbuster territory.Is it an easy movie to like? This is where things get interesting.To answer that question it is necessary to ascertain who this film is for; or inversely who it is that might appreciate the level of complexity inherent in the narrative of this artistic endeavour.Truth be told some ideas are just hard to fully piece together. That is why we have geniuses, great minds, average minds, small minds and minds that need help to just make it through a day.A quote attributed to Elenor Roosevelt opines that 'Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people.'In the light of this quote what Christopher Nolan is doing with this film is presentIng something the average mind should appreciate but really it is a narrative from a great mind intended for those who appreciate delving into meaty ideas - and let's face it time travel and it's inherent paradoxes aren't easy ideas to play with, especially if you really get into it.I suspect if Mr Nolan wanted to make a movie for the genius minds out there he could, but that's unlikely to deliver much of a financial return since there aren't that many geniuses available to fill cinema seats and guarantee overflowing coffers.The filmmakers should be applauded for even attempting to bring this story to the masses, knowing full well that 80% of us sit squarely in the 'minds needing help to get through the day' category. This film represents a triumph for original film making and I'm glad they took the risk. Cinema is enriched by their contribution.Do I recommend this film? Yes, because I want more films like this and for the film industry to wean itself off franchise fluff as the only means of it's future survival.I realise it's not for everyone but this small to average minded reviewer thought it was amazing."
2966,"This movie was great.To really appreciate this movie's efforts to need to have an idea of Christopher Nolan tries to accomplish in his movies.I liked everything about this movie. First of all it just throws you into the fray you get information later.The exposition is kept to a minimum which is good as you as the audience become invested into unravelling the plot.The acting is top tier you really feel the friendship/bromance between David and Robert.The third act is where this movie climaxes and boy oh boy does it climax. The action, the plotlines, the tension it is such a great payoff for the buildup the other acts set up."
2967,"Is it worth seeing in the theaters? Yes, especially in Dolby if you have the chance. This movie thrives with good sound and I know with Covid many aren't going to the theaters, but I'm glad we did...As other reviews might lead you to believe, this movie is confusing as hell. Don't feel bad if you see it and say ""What the heck just happened?"" It's intentionally confusing, with a broken timeline where you start off having no idea what's going on, and slowly as the movie evolves you understand more and more and by the end you'll probably get the overall plot, but not much else. Now I have bad hearing so I'm real hit and miss going to theaters, even with loud sound. Most things I watch with headphones or subtitles, however my daughter said the dialog was hard to follow so I guess I wasn't alone.But if you're like me after it's done, and hours later when your mind is still jello, go online and just search for tenet explained and a whole lot more will make sense. Or just wait another 6 months till you can rewatch the movie again and again until it makes sense, which I'll probably do as well. I do not recommend reading spoilers before seeing it or it will ruin a big aspect of the movie.If you've seen previews or at least read the synopsis, then you get that this is an action movie involving some weird ""time"" stuff, and I'm not going to say anymore than that, other than it's a somewhat original take on it, which is refreshing. That said like most movies that involve some sort of time manipulation you have to dispel belief and just go with it and that's no different here. Now whether or not it being so confusing and hard to follow is intentional to the point where it hides flaws, I couldn't really say until I've watched it a few more times, and with headphones or subtitles so I can actually make out what's being said.Overall it's a good action movie if nothing else, and definitely worth a watch on the big screen if you feel comfortable, if not it's still a good movie on your home TV, just be prepared to not get it the first time or be asking a lot of questions after. But I will say it's entertaining, and a somewhat original take on the idea and I will see it again"
2968,"The movie opens brilliantly (highly intense), right into the story. The movie does have a dense plot, which requires a lot of concentration to grasp but boasts visually stunning action that doesn't fail to blow your mind.
The concept of inversion is unique and fascinating and sets this apart from most other time related movies out there, simply due to its ability to deal with time effectively and believably. However, fully understanding the ideas of temporal pincers and inversion takes a bit of time and sometimes the film can be a little inaccessible. This is especially so, during the climax where certain details are hard to make out but the general idea would be clear if you're paying attention. Unlike what many say, there is an emotional punch to this movie as well. Side characters do a very good job. However, the protagonist lacks a bit of depth. The villian works for what the plot is about. And the score for this movie is absolutely brilliant, Mr Goransson nailed it.
Dialogue at times can be hard to hear at times but for the most part it's fine. Repeated viewings are encouraged to watch the movie from the perspective of different characters. The story becomes much clearer and the emotional impact is far greater."
2969,"Extremely entertaining and a must watch twice. After you fully understand the movie you will want to watch a few more times. The sound tracks, action and story are one of the best. This has become on of my top 5 films. Neil is a gemThis is my first ever review which says alot"
2970,Finally back at the movies and saw the much anticipated (by me) Tenet. So...my brain hurts a bit and I don't know whether I'm coming or going (you'll get that reference if you've seen it) and I loved it. It was all action from the get go with a music score to match but I'm not going to try and explain the plot except to say time travel is involved. Great performances from David Michael Washington and Robert Pattinson as well as Elizabeth Debicki and a sinister Kenneth Branagh. If someone who sees it can explain a Temporal Pinser Movement to me again please get in touch!
2971,I'm sure it makes sense to the writer and everyone who put this together. I can tell it's meticulous. And clever. But I walked out at the end of this movie with no clue about what I just saw and little inclination to see it again just so I could TRY and work it all out. I was one of a group of 6 who all kinda felt the same. I'm calling it 'too hard'.
2972,"Movie starts out with a shootout in the opera house. Which in turn doesn't add up to the plot of the movie. The second and third act really gets interesting. Especially with the inversion weapon and machine. I agree with some reviews that their are hidden elements in the movie. If you missed it, you will be confused. Christopher Nolan outdone himself with directing this movie. It was great seeing this in IMAX screen.COVID-19 truly does suck. I truly was waiting for the movie to come out. Almost 3/4 of the year is gone, finally I got to watch it. However disappointed to see less audience reactions from this movie. Also our movie theater restricted food and drinks. I was hungry and thirsty.I am thinking of watching this again however I wait until it is on Amazon Prime or YouTube Movies. Audio didn't feel loud or soft. It is the effect of inversion."
2973,"""Tenet"" is a cluster of good ideas with a tiring and confused execution. It seems that Nolan first thought of the scenes and visuals and then thought of a script, which is just a justification for the director to prove to the audience how good a filmmaker he is when it comes to the artistic direction of his work and practical effects.
We do not have an established morality, perhaps a thought about the consequences of the future and the past but that simply do not work or pass through, we see a hint of ""The origin"" in the course of the work, in its ambition to create a grand script and visual spectacle of the scenes and we also feel many characteristics of the film ""The arrival"", mainly in its narrative, moral and even scenes style, but without the same success of Denis Villeneuve's feature.Nolan signs the script alone, which is the great sin of the film, because in addition to the complex being, its narrative structure and editing do not favor it at all, and the Twister plot does not excite, the good part is due to the technical aspect which is excellent, starting with the great action scenes, very well directed, tense and exciting together with a fantastic soundtrack and as always in Nolan's films, a terrifyingly present mixing and editing, the long shots are very well used and the production design of the work in general is great.John David is great as a protagonist, the actor looks like us throughout the work, always confused waiting for the solution, Robert Pattisson is also fine, playing an ambiguous character and that leaves us with a backward moment at all times and Elizabeth convinces how a broken character looking for a fresh start, Kenneth Branagh is a great actor but the figuration and script of his villain is extremely cartoonish and empty, his villain andrei is a typical antagonist of 007.Tenet fits like a good action film, nothing more, its grand script doesn't work and its driving even less, I like complex and dubious films, but tentent it seems like it has nothing to discover, it's just a big empty box with great scenes. 7/10"
2974,"Telling a story backward sounds bizarre but it works, goofy and for a while it works. But once it doesn't, it really doesn't but what makes me anxious is that i have to write everything to understand the movie ."
2975,I liked it. Something about movie that are different from you standard typical plot. Especially a Nolan movie. But had to watch it twice to understand what's going on. I think I need to see it again to be sure
2976,Nolan at his very best giving another masterpiece.
2977,"There is some good action going on, but Inception I found more exciting - action- and story-wise. Tenet is (over-)complicated and I don't know if I really understood everything but I agree with Schoppenhauer (a German philosopher) - nothing is easier than to write in such a way that no man can understand it; but as nothing is more difficult than to express important thoughts in such a way that everyone must understand them. In this sense Tenet is a fail, I was not impressed by the story nor the ""physics"" or world-building, and I dare to say, like most directors, when time-travel and such is in a story involved, Nolan failed. Anyway, still an interesting and entertaining piece."
2978,"Very fast movie. There are 2 screenplay logic holes. The beginning scene, on how they got burnt and ended up there and the ending, on where the movie will lead and the protagonists back story. The movie often feeks like vast back story scenes where cut or the screenplay was adapted from a 10 part TV series and the linking scenes where chopped. The Time loops are incredible, with no logic flaws, excepting a prequel and sequel needing to be made, with possibly further and stranger time loops. The action is stylised to be unvelievable which is great, the portrayal of In-Law terrorism is genuine. The characters are colorful and the story throughput is immense. There is nothing dist-tasteful, it was great."
2979,"I promised myself I wasn't going to write a review for Tenet until I gave it a second watch, but at this point I don't think I will be seeing it again until it is released on dvd, so here I go anyway. Tenet is good. The cast is great, as is the acting and the special effects. However, I had a much harder time understanding this movie than I did with Inception. Granted, I've seen Inception numerous times since its theater release. Not that I'm comparing it to Inception because I obviously understand they are two very different films. I'm just trying to make a point that Tenet is so confusing. I get the whole war between the future and the present aspect but the way the story was paced made it very difficult to understand. Maybe I'm just stupid and that's okay because I still enjoyed it for the most part. However, I'm a huge fan of Nolan's work and had very high hopes for this movie. I think one thing that really bothered me was how it sort of started to drag in the middle. I will say this though, the opening scene is fantastic. I had no clue what was going on but my eyes were glued to the screen. I can understand how a lot of people might view this as Nolan's best film, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. But I was underwhelmed. I will definitely give it another watch at some point, maybe my opinion will change then."
2980,"The actors are prefect and work well together and this is probably my shortest review ever just because I don't want to spoil it I want u to go watch, the time emotions are prefect and done really well."
2981,"What did I just watch? I couldn't follow this...characters walking forward while others walk backward? In order to accomplish what? Two characters are talking while on an airport bus (going to a plane or from one?), then the conversation continues in the next scene but they are now walking on a street.
I don't know if watching it again would even help."
2982,"Christopher Nolan has flirted with calamity, most apparently in the flawed Interstellar. His desire to over-complicate narratives, deep dive into lofty concepts and surprise his audience with ""how clever am I?"" twists has, at times, been at the expense of characterisation and sustained dramatic tension. It smacks of Shyamalan.
Nolan's mostly gotten away with it until now, because he's superbly talented, but in Tenet he serves up a convoluted entanglement that likely makes sense upon fine dissection, but doesn't work dramatically. Tenet feels like a two-hour physics lecture, albeit one delivered with Nolan's undeniable visual flair and robust penchant for mind-bending in-camera effects. But this is ultimately a writer-director in an act of self-aggrandisement in which he treats his loyal viewership, perhaps subconsciously, with a level of disdain.
#Tenet might have worked better as a limited TV series, which would have given Nolan more time to deepen the characterisation and make us feel as if there's something at stake. But Nolan still takes 150 minutes to convey Tenet and its palindromic idea. He reduces his characters to bloodless pawns, filling their mouths with expository dialogue that is often delivered so quickly by the cast that it's actually unintelligible. By forcing his audience to run maths equations in their mind as the action unfolds, essentially confused by what is happening, the kinetic, breathless set pieces don't have the same dramatic impact of those in his far more successful films like The Dark Knight, Insomnia or Inception. Tenet is a cool idea, and the spy thriller meets heist flick is a great framework, but the writing is messy. Nolan's core audience may soon become quantum physicists.
Despite these criticisms, John David Washington and Robert Pattinson are required to do a lot of heavy lifting to bring gravitas to the story and they're both excellent."
2983,"This movie is like a book split into two halves. The first book is a little confusing, but then the second half is where it all makes sense. The movie is awesome, the way it looks is amazing, the story is fun. It's worth seeing twice, just to appreciate all the work put into it and it's worth it. Check it out, you won't regret it."
2984,"Well since I saw this movie yesterday I guess this will be my first review on here.
Tenet is no doubt, a film that you need to see in cinemas if you are interested. It reaches that level of an experience on a technical level that no TV in the universe could do it justice. At first I liked its plot, it was a bit confusing but relatively simple, but at the movie goes on it starts throwing in more stuff that it does get convoluted and hard to follow (Maybe that was the intention idk). Not to mention there are a ton of of plot questions that arent answered, unless I missed something. My only other complaint is that the main 2 characters are dry and forgettable, the villain was intimidating enough though. Those are pretty much my only complaints. The action is immaculate, the camerawork is great and never has any shaky cam, the acting is decent, the writing is a lot of exposition but it keeps it entertaining by having the dialogue be fast and quick since the movie is very fast paced, and the soundtrack was a loud of bass which can get annoying but the instruments were great and the music fit the film very well and epicly. Overall, I really recommend seeing this film for all of that!"
2985,"It's a good thriller mixing time and mystery, good overall continuity"
2986,It's an interesting move with cool effects & plot. But you might want a PhD in physics if you want to understand it all. It's so hard to keep up with you just have to let go & watch. I feel if I watch it again I might able to keep up with the special effects this time.7/10 I will watch it again
2987,"Nolan is obsessed with the time issue, and all his movies go through him. It is a little weak compared to other movies, but it can still be watched. The scenes he meets with him are ridiculous, you have to go there, but you know that his past is there, you must act accordingly. The backward flowing of the images sounds nice at first, but after a while it becomes tiring."
2988,"This movie is terrible with soundtrack, dialogue is not clear, plot is interesting but you need to watch it with subtitle. #temporalpincer"
2989,"It's not about the Character Development, Narrative or Writting... It's about the final thought where you realize that all of what you just witnessed makes total sense inside the rules of this world. Making this film a complete spectacle!"
2990,"#chrisnolan takes all his filmmaking effort to deliver the ultimate spy-action-thriller. His wife #emmathompson brings live-action production value beyond marvel standards. Down from the cinematic / movie-going crisis, these international movie release emerges as a 'Victor' for its relentless emotional impact on a future 'Bond' inverted movie universe."
2991,"With so many saying how hard it is to hear the dialogue, and after months of theater closures, we don't want to return to the theater only to be frustrated. Decided to wait until the DVD comes out with subtitles."
2992,"Rob is so hot when he says god damn it and screw it. The female character is beautiful and lovingly fragile. However, I just don't see the connection in she and the man. Their motivation are so weak and not very convincing. As for the time reverse part, I kind of lost when the Russian husband tried to kill her. P.S. the sound effect makes me almost have a heart attack."
2993,"Starts off with action, but little to no explanation. The characters are distant and completely flat. The main character remains unknown and makes it very difficult to sympathise with or simply understand his reasoning.The story's premise is intriguing, but not well executed nor explained. Furthermore, rubbing the audience's nose in it with dialogue like:
""-Do you understand it?""
""-Not at all.""
This is an unforgivable move, to expect the audience to simply accept that they will not understand it and not even attempt to explain it...The sound mixing is terrible, so much so, that vital information is missed - which is often via dialogue and not visual. There's very little visual story telling. The music is not spectacular, but fit the movie well.So, the dialogue is difficult to comprehend but is vital to understand the story, but the characters are extremely boring. Therefore, it is difficult to be interested in the story, but it does not end there... The goal for the main character is ambiguous and his relationship with other characters are confusing and unexplained. There is no sense of time whatsoever, except that the main character changes outfit in every other scene. There is no sense of urgency either and the drawn out final fire fight is baffling - since the conclusion is extremely hasty, dull and not at all emotional."
2994,"After seeing Tenet the first time, I had to work out in my mind the basic logic of the premise. After a discussion with my wife who also saw the movie with me, I found I worked out a lot of the detail and had even had some revelations. I avoided ""Tenet explained"" articles and YouTube videos. One week later, we went to see it a second time. On second viewing, the movie made much more sense and tied many loose ends in the logic. It enabled me to step back and marvel at the scale of the movie including the practical stunts, fabulous acting and beautiful settings.
We struggled with the audio of the movie. I understand that this was deliberate. Christopher Nolan has said one needs to feel the movie. When I see it for the third time. I plan to just take it in and not try to ""understand it, just feel it."" This is one of those films that will have a relatively low IMDb score initially. In years time I can see this climbing the IMDb ranks like The Prestige, for example, which by the way, like Tenet, the characters tell the audience what to expect through exposition. The Prestige clearly states it's a slight of hand. Tenet clearly states try not to understand it, just feel it. I am withholding my rating until I've had more time with the movie, which is a process that might take a few years."
2995,"The best film since Avatar.
That's ten years!!
Superior to Inception and it's a whole 1 star lower on IMDB??
What has happened to people's intellect??
Did it disappear due to COVID??
This movie is so technically brilliant, only James Cameron is above Christopher Nolan in that regard. Nolan is the best director of the past 15 years. His movieography is proof of this.Went to the theatres with high expectations and those were absolutely shattered. Set mine sky high and TENET blew them right through my stratosphere. The scale, complexity and depth of this movie is staggering.
Nolan is one of the greats in all of Hollywood history. A true behemoth of a filmmaker and TENET is his greatest achievement. I did not think he could make a better movie than The Dark Knight Rises, but he has outdone himself. This is Nolan's greatest masterpiece.Firmly in my top 10 all-time favorite movies.
A perfect 10 out of 10."
2996,"A pretty good movie which is neither a masterpiece nor mediocre or crap. It is an excellent production, directed by Christopher Nolan, who once again shocks with incredible action scenes, incredible shots and the original script, which has nothing to do with his previous films. The photography is also amazing, the two protagonists are quite good, with Pattinson standing out more and the music finally fits perfectly with the film and creates an incredible atmosphere and huge suspense. The negatives of the film are the clichés that exist despite the original script (the good one who wants to save the world and the bad one who wants to destroy it) and its long duration as there were several unnecessary scenes and in this way you got tired of it detuned, making it difficult to understand the already difficult plot and losing some details that may have been the key to understanding what was going on."
2997,"Jean-Paul Sartre once said that the Great Literature is That Which Can Disturb You!
Now its meaning is that while you read anything, then that subject or plot and the characters involved in it do compel the reader to think ,to analyze ,to interpret and come up with other perspectives.
Now connecting it with the great Filmmaker Christopher Nolan and his great movies and the landmark ideas being presented in his movies.
TENET is the latest movie written and directed both by Christopher Nolan.First of all let me admit that it was a great moment for me to enter in the cinema hall after 07 Months due to the post COVID-19 situation, and the joy was amazing for me as a passionate lover and cinema lover for decades.during all the past 07 months I kept engaging with the concerned authorities to reopen the cinemas and I do take pride to be apart of this campaign.
Now coming to TENET, I must say Wowwwwwwww, What a great movie it is and it was just like to enter in the cinema with an empty mind with a curiosity and then coming out of it with your mind is being full with so many questions and the things needed to be discussed related to this great TENET Idea.I will not discuss the movie particularly as it would be a spolier, but what always amazed me after watching a Nolan's movie is that it always make you think, rethink and again to think to come up with the different perspectives. It is a feeling to think then being critical of that very thought and coming up with a different aspect or approach with a creative thinking to challenge your own idea, that is a beauty of a Critical, Creative, Scientific and a Philosophical thinking.Moving through time in different directions
TENET will compell you to do so and you have to watch it multiple times and once you will watch it then you have to have read or to watch things related to the concepts of Time, Moving through time in different directions.TENET The Classic......."
2998,"Success in times of COVID-19. It is a very bold and risky step to launch this masterpiece, which deserves at least seven Oscars, during a pandemic. In many countries, cinemas are completely closed. What can I say about the film: Nolan's visuals effects and plot are as good as ever. Warner Bros allvais to surprise. My rating is 10 out of 10."
2999,"Put on your brain-bending pants, cause it's time for Tenet! Christopher Nolan's long-awaited time traveling blockbuster is in cinemas despite COVID-19 ravaging the movie-going public.With everything that's gone on in 2020, the act of going to the movies feels anachronistic. It's like inverting time and going back to when it was okay to inhale popcorn aromas and other people's air without fear of suffering a horrible death. Is Tenet worth the health risk?Well, no. If you live in a place where COVID-19 is looming large, DO NOT GO TO THE CINEMA and risk yourself, or others! But in a safe environment (preferably at home, or a drive-in) Tenet is good, and I'm not just saying that because as a cinema fan it feels like I'm starving in the desert and someone threw me a cracker. It's actually genuinely good.Like the majority of Nolan's filmography, it's grand in both scale of production and ideas. He's always played with notions of temporality in film, but not quite this much since 2000's Memento. That film operated on the novel concept of telling its story in reverse, and the only clear way to one up that is to run a story both backwards and forwards at the same time, right? Enter Tenet.John David Washington plays a secret agent known only as ""The Protagonist"". He's sent on a mission to find the source of mysterious weaponry that's seemingly travelling backwards in time from a war destined to happen in the future. With the help of fellow agent Neil (Robert Pattinson), he ends up on the trail of a notorious arms dealer, Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh) and his wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki). Sator is up to all sorts of temporal-no-good, and the race to save both the future and the past is on.As usual, Nolan dazzles with a Bond-esque world tour of locations, an array of ambitious practical effects, and prodigiously filmed chase scenes. The incredible visuals are underscored by a head-splitting soundtrack that's so loud it might actually reverse time on its own. The action is dizzying, like being hit with a flashbang, but then again, maybe I've just spent too much time in lockdown and I'm no longer able to handle the stimulus? Either way, it's impressive stuff.Where Tenet shines most is in its concepts. Ideas are packed so tight it feels like the movie is going to explode and collapse under the sheer weight of time travel theory and philosophy. A vast majority of Nolan's screenplay appears to have been written on grid and graph paper, with more interest in mathematical technicality of scenes rather than characters. But, if you're a veteran of the man's movies, you'll already know to expect this going in. His weak point has always been the clinical nature of his human drama.Nolan's characters are always so busy shooting thick expository dialogue and plot all over each other that there's no chance to develop real chemistry. The dramatically crucial relationships between Branagh and Debicki, and Debicki and Washington, both fail to crackle. There may be a tiny spark of real chemistry between Washington and Pattinson, but they're always so pressed into action and plot that whatever was there gets buried, and when it should be paying off toward the end, the audience feels nothing.Washington's character has the charisma of a two-by-four, but that's most likely the direction he was given rather than the actor's fault. Pattinson doesn't fare much better. In some instances, the movie actively works against you connecting with its characters. During one of the lengthy, pivotal action scenes, our heroes are lost amongst a platoon of soldiers wearing masks. It makes you feel like you're watching someone play Call of Duty.Yes, Tenet suffers from many of the same problems as Nolan's other work. The issues are perhaps amplified here by the absence of Hans (currently tied up with Dune) Zimmer's emotionally charged bombast that gave their previous collaborations a boost in the heart department. Ludwig Göransson is a decent replacement for Zimmer, and fills the air with some intriguing reversed music and sounds, but still doesn't quite hit the same heights as Zimmer.Sure, this is a ""thinking person's"" action film, but, don't think about it for too long. Tenet invites second, or third viewings to understand all of its time traveling nuance. Maybe I'll figure it out eventually, but after a single viewing? I'm convinced the story doesn't make a lick of sense. For example, when a hole is punched in a wall by a bullet from the future, at what point in the past does that hole first appear? Cause and effect doesn't work that way, Christopher! I don't care if you had renowned theoretical physicist Kip Thorne in the credits! It doesn't make sense!But despite all the whining and complaining I've done here, I had huge amounts of fun with Tenet. I was engaged for the entire two and a half hours. The film throws so much at you, there's no chance to get bored, and it gives us things we've never quite seen in a movie before.With the state of cinema at the hands of coronavirus, Tenet feels bittersweet, like some kind of finale for blockbuster cinema. Or maybe more like a funeral dirge. In 2013, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg prophesied the death of the blockbuster, albeit under different circumstances. COVID seems to have made that prediction come true, at least for the foreseeable future.Unfortunately, Tenet is an experience that deserves to be fulfilled on a big screen, and in glorious 70mm, but therein lies the problem with Warner releasing it right now. While so many parts of the world are overrun by COVID infection, it's impossible and irresponsible to recommend people go out and see it today, especially in virus hotspots. By all means, go and see it at a drive-in, but in a traditional cinema? Don't risk it. Wait until you can pop some corn and relax on the couch at home."
3000,"It was a good start to watch movie with only five other brave one. Movie was not too long, so quite a good ending to a working say.Plot contained some good points and twists but overall it contained all (bad) hollywood elements- car run, family issues, Total badass,
Stupid effects, nobody is hit (where was the enemy?) and fist fight in the end."
3001,"It's been almost a week since I've seen the film because I really wanted to fully process it before writing this. Nolan is easily my favorite director and Tenet is my most anticipated movie ever, so this is a difficult review for me to write. I love Nolan for his ambitious, high-concept ideas, and Tenet certainly has that (time inversion? I love it), but I also love him for the way he blends this mind bending story with characters you care about and extreme depth of themes. My two favorite of his films, The Dark Knight and The Prestige, are perfect showcases of this: they have an interesting central idea, but the beating heart of the films are their fascinating protagonists and the many themes they allow Nolan to explore.In Tenet, you have a wild idea: what if you had objects and people who could move backwards in time? It's a great sci-fi premise and Nolan does an undeniably amazing job creating the action scenes through practical effects. Ultimately, I do think it's more of an exploration of how this premise could happen in an action espionage setting than a backdrop for a more human story. The best way to describe this is: many of the people who love Tenet talk about how perfectly everything fits together, how rewatchable it is, and how you keep thinking and puzzling over it after it's done. I completely agree that those are great signs for a film and one of the things I love about Nolan movies, but I think it underscores Tenet's shortcoming actually. After you finish watching Tenet, all the questions you have and things you keep thinking about are purely mechanical - what was the timeline for this event? How did this happen when it did? There weren't any emotions I felt for the characters afterwards, characters I wanted to consider and dive deeper into, or major themes that resonated. Maybe on a rewatch some minor themes would reveal themselves, perhaps along the lines of how perfect information or perfect technology doesn't really make the world a better place, it just raises the dangerous stakes by making everyone, good or bad, more powerful. Even then I feel like I'm grasping a bit. The one character piece I did like was the relationship between The Protagonist and Neil. We see how loyal Neil is, and in the ending we see all of their interactions in a new light, which I love. Kat was definitely intended to be the emotional linchpin of the movie, and I do love Debicki's performance, but thought the script gave her a generic and over-the-top view. She is more desperate to save the world than others because she wants to save her son? Alright. The movie does for the most part make sense as you piece things together, but when you finally see that full picture it feels more like ""okay, that's what this movie is. What's interesting about it now that I know what happened in it?"" and less ""oh, that's so satisfying, now that I understand the film I'll really want to revisit and reconsider it.""Now this isn't to say that I think Tenet is a bad movie. I think it's a great premise and is extremely thoughtfully made, but I think the focus was so much on how to make an intricate plot that they didn't make it a resonant one. To tell the truth, Tenet felt far more like a Bond movie than I would've liked. I don't hate the Bond movies, I just think they're mediocre - fine action and a pretty generic plot (with plenty of misogyny), but nothing really exciting or anything deeper to explore. Tenet is certainly more riveting than the Bond movies I've seen - it's still a very well shot and acted film, and the plot is an interesting one at least. It does suffer from the same problem of being more flashy action than nuanced themes and characters, though. I do appreciate that Nolan plays off of Bond tropes in certain ways - not having scenes where the protagonist seduces a girl just for the sake of it, for instance. That general feel of prioritizing plot and style over substance is the biggest reason Tenet was a letdown for me.I will remark on the much maligned sound choices made by Nolan here. I do see both sides of the argument - it is an interesting conceptual exercise to treat the film as an experience and let the audience imagine as though they are experiencing it, so sound is loud as it is in real life and you don't always hear everything perfectly. Most viewers also do have a point that making a film whose primary source of intrigue is its intricate plot and premise have sound design that makes the audience unable to hear a good amount of dialogue is a problematic choice. At the end of the day it's not a huge issue for me, and I do like the way the gunfire in action scenes sounded very realistic, but I would've preferred sound design that prioritized understanding a bit more dialogue.I do think all three main performances by Washington, Pattinson, and Debicki are all very good. Washington is especially great in the action scenes, and the choreography and editing for those are absolutely stunning. The movie also does have several legitimately funny moments (my favorite being Pattinson's ""it wasn't impenetrable last week"" line). I also like Nolan's attempt to tie in the Sator square, but after thinking about it I really don't think it actually holds any deeper meaning and was just thrown in to add another level of parallelism and easter egg. I definitely do recommend the movie, as it is not easy to execute such an ambitious premise so well, and I was not bored for a second. At the same time, it's hard to look back on Tenet and not be disappointed when there's not much left for you to go back to and think deeper on, especially when I consider my level of anticipation for the film and how amazing it could've been."
3002,"It's not scientific. But just follow the logic, maybe it's not bad for brainpower recovery.
As to the noise, I think it does help enhance the plot expression. Pitifully, it's not beautiful, so I guess the Academy will not award it in 2021."
3003,"Loves the action and music, but was and still confused with the plot and story line, thus unable to provide with a high rank"
3004,"The general plot is understood
The details are exaggerated!! Complicated and fast , don't push it Nolan !!"
3005,"Typical flatness, too much action, and illogical situations (in short typical WB), trying to tell a Nolan story. This combination doesn't work. Still it was interesting to watch so 7."
3006,"I've been waiting for Tenet for a long while. Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite directors, and this was well worth the long COVID quarantine wait! It's the first time in 6 months I've actually gone to the movies, and whoa, this movie was mind blowing! Time Inversion/Reversal/Travel science fiction meets a gripping spy thriller! Bravo to all involved! Robert Pattinson and Kenneth Branagh deliver Oscar worthy performances, and John David Washington, The Protagonist of the film, is a son who is rising to the level of his famous father as far as acting goes (his father is Denzel Washington).I'm not going to give anything of the plot away safe to say that in Tenet, NOTHING is what it appears to be and you will go on one of the best rides that Christopher Nolan has delivered to the cinemas in years! It's on my list now of my Top Science Fiction films ever! It was well worth the long quarantine wait!! Bravo!!"
3007,"It's confusing not because it's smart or profound, but because it doesn't make sense. With all the paradoxes involved, there are only three kinds of time travel story: the ones that adapts multiverse, the ones that embraces fatalism (determinism), and the ones that don't try to make sense. Tenet, a story not only about time travel, but also time *reversal*, is a mix of the last two: ""Whatever happened happened"", and ""Don't try to understand it, feel it."" At the very beginning of the film, the director literally tells you not to think about the mechanism of anything. With all your thinking ability deprived, all is left for you to do is sit back and accept whatever story they feed you, and all the loud music they shout into your ear.When you boil it down, it's just a mission impossible with a ""high concept"" that doesn't make sense.BTW, are we sure this film is not written by Jonathan? /s"
3008,Hard to hear the dialogue in many sections of the movie. A lot of action right out of the opening scene. Time travel always fascinating but this one with reverse motion is different. Need to watch twice.
3009,The first half of the movie does not give any information whatsoever to the viewer in order to understand what is going on. Want to watch a time bending motion picture? Binge watch the Dark series instead. It's the same thing but set and plotted in a more understanding way.
3010,"""Despair"" beats ""anger"" in terms of how far it can command you. So in that way despair is a more basic feeling than anger. It is also a feminin feeling as opposed to the masculine anger. Tenet is about a battle between those two feelings or state of mind."
3011,"""Tenet"" (2020 release; 150 min.) brings the story of a CIA agent whom we get to know only as The Protagonist. As the movie opens, the Protagonist is part of a SWAT team that storms the opera house in Kiev, Ukraine, to save an exposed agent. All mayhem brakes loose, and the Protagonist is captured by the bad guys. During a rough interrogation, the Protagonist manages to bite on a cyanide pill. When he wakes up, a CIA guys tells him ""welcome to the afterlife"", and that the opera house mission was a test, and that he passed the test. The Protagonist now is tasked with a much larger project: Tenet. It's not long before the Protagonist learns that if he fails the mission, WWIII will unleash and destroy mankind... At this point we're less than 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest opus (don't just call it a film) from writer-director Christopher Nolan, who has been working on this labor of love for YEARS. As I'm sure you've heard, it evolves around inverted objects and people, or some sort of reverse chronology. As soon as the movie starts, there is an immediate overload of information and action, and soon the viewer feels engulfed in a Byzantine plot. TO which I say: don't worry, just let it go. Rather than trying to understand everything as it is happening, just enjoy the experience for what it is: a mind-blowing movie going experience, pure and simple. At one point, one of the characters comments dryly: ""We have been attacked by the future"", and that about sums it up. The many elaborate action scenes are nothing short of jaw dropping spectacular (just try imagining a car chase at full speed, inverted...). John David Washington is outstanding as the Protagonist, but a special kudos to Kenneth Branagh as the Russian Andrei Sator. It's been a long time since I've seen such a great ""baddie"". The movie's production budget is a reported $200-250 million, give or take $10 mill here and there, and the movie shows it. Beware: some of the sound effects are quite overwhelming, and at times drawn out the dialogue. All that aside, this movie BEGS to be seen on the big screen, and I have zero doubt that I will see it again in the theater in the next few weeks.""Tenet"" was set for a wide release in July, but alas, a little thing called COVID-19 interfered with those plans. The movie FINALLY opened wide this weekend (after several days of sneak previews). I couldn't wait to see this, and bought tickets in advance for the Friday early evening screening at the Cinemark here in Cincinnati. Imagine my shock when it turned out there were only 4 people in the audience (including myself). This is terrible news for the movie industry, the theaters, and of course film fans all around this country. ""Tenet"" deserves better than this, and the Cinemark where I saw this at, complied with all required COVID-19 protocols. If you are a fan of earlier Christopher Nolan films like ""Inception"" and ""Memento"", I't readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater if you can, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
3012,"The physics degree helped.
I missed half the plot first time round but the spectacle, inventive mechanics and some of the most extraordinary set pieces I've ever seen left me looking forward to my second viewing even before the credits rolled. There is a masterpiece in there and I was more than happy to work for it but I imagine some won't have the patience."
3013,Nollan tried to make a film like inception but the film is much more unundrestandabe than it shoud be.
3014,"...the audio mix is terrible. The brilliant visuals and new concept of traversing through time is unfortunately overshadowed by a horrific mix of dialogue, music, and sound effects. I'm pretty sure test audiences were not used because if they had been they would have collectively said ""What?"" At least HALF of the dialogue I missed and had to guess what was said. It was about 2/3 into the movie until a quiet two person conversation happened that I actually heard them clearly. I LOVE Christopher Nolan but have never been this frustrated in a film. (Think Interstellar and Bane from TDKR...hard to hear a lot of parts, but this beat them both easily). My advice would be to WAIT and buy this film and watch it at home with captions on!"
3015,"(Spoiler Free Section)
This movie is an excellent film with some serious thought going into its complicated design. The sad thing is that a lot of people are going to hate on this film because they could not keep up with everything going on in it. There are many layers to this movie with many things that pop out once you put more thought into your viewing. If you struggled keeping up with Inception (another excellent Nolan film) then this movie is going to much harder for you to follow.The largest complaint I had with the movie is that it felt as if the music was too loud. I wasn't sure if it was the theater I was in or the movie itself. I have since seen a few reviews that said this was intentionally done in order to obscure some of the dialog so that it doesn't give away the plot and twists. During the movie I kept thinking to myself that I can't wait to watch this with subtitles so that I know what people are saying. This is now doubly more true to see if these are truly obscured on purpose and add another layer of depth.If you like movies that make you think and love to try to foresee what is coming (and then love it when you don't see it all) this is definitely a movie for you. It is also a very action packed movie that has some great action scenes. However if you just want an easy watch to relax and mellow out to this is not your movie.(Spoiler Section)There are so many hidden nods and items in this movie you can not catch them all in one watching. Some you will really have to think for such as the use of the title and how it ties into other names such as Sator and Arepo. However, I was surprised that Tenet itself was not used very much in the film. It was a bit of a early mechanism that fades away rather quickly. The word itself seems to be more important that it's use in the film.The acting is excellent and is well cast. Robert Pattinson and David Washington really shine together on screen. It felt like I was watching a Bond film with two Bonds at certain points. The scenery and sets are really well done and have a lot of depth and thought to them such as the use of Red and Blue to show the inversion versus the normal time.(Major Spoiler Don't Look If You Don't Want to Know)The one question I am really left with is: If he was the mastermind then who recruited him to become the mastermind?"
3016,"Ok, seriously, please stop saying the sound quality is bad or that the speaking is muffled in parts of the movie. That is clearly done intentionally. All is revealed, if you just pay attention. Looking forward to watching it a 2nd time, so I can pick up on even more."
3017,"For those who have been clamoring for famed director Chris Nolan to get a shot at directing a Bond movie - you (sorta) just got your wish. Tenet is a two-and-a-half hour thrill ride that rivals Bond films of the past, but with a heavy dose of those Nolan mind games that his fans know and love. Every minute of the film is needed and absorbed by the audience, as the 150-minute experience becomes just a memory before you realize how long you've been sitting there watching."
3018,"This was a good film, once I understood the concept of the inversion then it's quite a straight forward (excuse the pun) affair.Purposeful confusion at the beginning echoing our protagonists own bewilderment, then as he finds out what is going on it falls into place just after for the audience.I have a feeling my rating will increase on second viewing."
3019,"The fake drawing being kept in a vault ? No point. I get that Kenneth wasn't happy for being tricked to buy a fake painting/drawing, but I see no point in keeping it, or why it would be a value for him or threat to Kate. That was lame excuse for the plot and lame reason for the team to to go into the vault, in the first place. With all the power Kenneth had in the world and against Kat (son) , drawing is just nonsense and flaw in the plot. Also, agree that there were poor voice sounds, compared to loud music. Theatre popcorn eating sounds were louder than actors voices, at the moments. I heard them, but it was a stretch. Finally, in the 25-35 minutes around the Kate being introduced and talked about the drawing, I almost fell asleep cause it was slow paced and stupid drawing story took unnecessary ample of time"
3020,"This movie was incredible, Christopher Nolan never ceases to surprise me with his masterful directing style and mesmerizing plot lines.Pros:
Incredible cinematography and score. This movie was a visceral experience, a must see in theaters for the full experience.The plot was almost perfect, it lost me in the 2nd act but the final act really pulled it together and left me amazed with the writing and wanting more.Robert Pattinson was great, looking forward to The Batman after seeing this.If you like Nolan's adventurous and fantastical stories like Inception, Interstellar, and The Prestige then you will definitely like this movie.Cons:
John David Washington wasn't convincing in a lot of the ""espionage CIA agent"" suave scenes. He delivered a lot of lines in a meek way without much charisma, however he was fantastic in the action sequences. I'm excited to see him grow as an actor though he has a lot of potential.The score drowned out the dialogue a lot of the times, and other times the accents made it difficult to find out how the plot was developing. This movie is such an intense visual experience that the dialogue needed to be clearer to help guide the viewers at confusing points in the plots development. Looking forward to rewatching with subtitles.-The ""Bad Guy"" Russian actor also wasn't very convincing either. He didn't hurt the movie but he didn't really help it either."
3021,"It's hard to follow! But I enjoyed, every second there's excitement."
3022,"Tenet has to be the most complex movie I've ever seen to date. It makes Inception and the time-dilation in Interstellar seem trivial! At times I found it hard to hear the characters over the music so I was half grasping what was going on throughout and had to do some googling afterwards. The cinematography, action and music was also incredible and I look forward to watching it again."
3023,"Critique first and movie story/spoilers further down.So Christopher Nolan delivers another mind bending movie. If you watched Inception and thought 'Could he have made it any harder to follow?' Christopher Nolan just responded 'Hold my beer'.I understand the script was 10 years in the making and you will see every bit of that detail on screen and you will almost certainly only understand half on first viewing. As visually stunning and intellectually stimulating as it is, it is hard to imagine it will appeal to a mass movie audience...the Marvel Cinematic Universe it is not. The biggest shame is that for all the time spent on the concept and creating a script that truly captured those details, the sound editing almost destroys it. One of the plot devices requires the characters to wear masks (a Nolan trademark by now) through most of the movie and there were several scenes where whole sections of relevant dialogue were unintelligible. There were also sections where the amazing score by Ludwig Gorranson completely drowned out the dialogue. It became an exercise in frustration, trying to understand the plot through the context of actions that do not play out linearly. For all the times I ever railed against poorly delivered exposition I am now ashamed. I was not alone in this opinion, the 15 friends that rented the theater with me felt the same way. I recall seeing the Matrix for the first time back in '95 and knowing it would take two or three viewings to get it all, when virtual reality was still pretty conceptual and not a part of our daily lives as it is now. Know this now; the Matrix was kindergarten and Tenet is your college thesis.Nolan is a master filmmaker and Tenet is no exception. Every second on screen serves the story. The acting is phenomenal and I loved the way the dialogue was delivered quick and to the point, invoking the feel of a David Mamet movie.They were very tight lipped about the story and after the first 10 minute trailer dropped a year ago everyone assumed it was a time travel action movie but it is better understood as a time reversal movie. If you are traveling through time you are skipping over time and landing in another; in the Tenet universe you can travel backwards and forwards in time but no faster than you normally would; you cannot skip time.SPOILERS
Having only seen the movie once I hope I can convey the story accurately without giving too much away. The story opens with an amazing raid/rescue on an opera house where we learn the protagonist (really, that's his name) is part of a team that is so clandestine no one person knows the whole mission and you can only know who is on your team with preplanned code phrases. The rescue goes awry and he is captured. Facing interrogation and torture he chooses suicide by cyanide pill but to his surprise wakes up alive and well having been rescued while unconscious. The pill was a fake, a test it seems to determine how committed he is to a mission he does not even know. Having proven his loyalty, he is made next level, that is he gets to know what the clandestine operations are all about... inverted time. Sometime far in the future someone has discovered how to 'invert' objects, that is how to make them travel backwards through time. Inverted objects are being discovered all over the world, mostly moving on a black market controlled by an arms dealer, Kenneth Branagh as perfectly sinister and menacing as any villain ever was . Inverted objects have reverse entropy. An inverse bullet will return to the gun, but only of course if you fired it sometime in the future and inverted explosions suck people toward ground zero instead of away. Our protagonist must make contact with the dealer and trick him into revealing his connection to stop objects from traveling backwards because the more inverted objects invade real time, the less stable it becomes. Along the way the protagonist roots out other members of his team (Robert Pattenson) for help and coerces the dealer's reluctant wife into the cause.This inversion plot device is the catalyst to amazing action sequences where car chases must occur backwards, you have to run away from the fight to engage it, you must un-fire a gun to kill your enemy and the damage you see around you foreshadows the conflict to come. Each plot twist sends us deeper into time reversal where we discover that not only objects can be inverted but also people. And if people can be inverted so can their plans. And if the plans come backwards from the future how can your mission succeed if everyone in the future knows what you are going to do? The story explores many such questions posed by the inversion concept.Tenet is a masterpiece but it's also a big pill to swallow even if you could understand everything the characters were saying the first time.I give it a 10 on concept, 8 on execution and a 5 on mass appeal."
3024,"Loved it!
Worth the money to see in person.
Was enthralled all the way.
Didn't seem like 2h30m, nice."
3025,"Update after 2nd viewing: change grade from 7 to 9.Now I can follow 95% of the plot, and understand most of the dialogues, and it's a pure joy. Will naw on the remaining 5% for future viewing, I like leaving something unexplained, for future enjoyment.The story design is so genius, but the ""loose ends"" are like unfinished game levels that I have too come back to revisit.Realized the silliness of some of the things I said below, after the first viewing. The key is to understand that the inverted movements are simply perceptions from the vantage point of the forward moving person. It's embarrassing to get stuck in that view point, the adjustment is crucial too eliminate much of the confusion and frustration.Enjoy it everyone! It was a hello of a treat after the dreadful COVID shutdown!!!--original review--Pros:
-High concept
-Stylish
-Rewatching value high
-Great topic with friends or strangers on twitter
-Largely delivers for a summer flickCons:
-A bit hollow and superficial in spirit, end of world? Yeah right😏 I am more curious as to how it actually would happen, SPOILER ALERT: It doesn't (oh darn, did I ruin it for ya?)-Paper-thin characters, the only emotional stake is, you guessed it, damsel in distress, and awww, a child who may die (SPOILER ALERT, children are just concepts in Nolanland, he has trouble showing their faces either in close-ups or for more than 0.5 sec, but he likes to use them as props).-Overwhelming soundtrack, loud throughout, so much so I treated it as a foreign film with no subtitles, which clearly degraded my cognitive capacity. I felt like missing all the nuances and Easter eggs, to the point, for the first time in my life, I felt stupid watching the last 2/3 of the movie because I lost track of all dialogues and the who, where, why, when of most of it.-While novel, the main concept is ludicrous and was not portrayed consistently. If you envision what happens with our digestive system, you know the primary physiological functions of our lives, in his timelines, the concept falls apart. Eww! Quote ""you are not shooting it, you are catching it"".As you can see, I had fun picking it apart just as I had fun with its innovations. Will definitely rewatch, but it's not as mind blowing as some are claiming because its flaws are more noticeable, and sometimes painful to ignore."
3026,"I won't deny this movie looks great for the most part and has a great story to tell, but unfortunately it ends up being an unfollowable mess. I say it's unfollowable not because the main story here is hard to understand, it was actually quite easy (and even a bit predictable for the most part for me) when you can actually hear and follow the dialogue.Sometimes I feel like a scene was cut that sets up a character's dialogue but we still get the conversation that doesn't seem to matter, yet it seems to matter. Like when two characters are talking about a painting and how it's a fake and her husband knows it's a fake and is using it to hold over her. For what? What is he holding it over her for? This is never explained especially considering he's already using their son to keep her in line.I've seen people suggest that you need to see this movie twice and one person suggest subtitles to truly enjoy it. It can't be that good of a movie if you can't follow it while you're watching it, is it?Is it different? Yes. Is it great. No, but I look forward to seeing what Nolan gives us next."
3027,"I'll keep it short. The characters are one dimensional, and not interesting for the viewer to really care about. The dialogue at times is so stupid. The audio mixing, don't get me started on the mixing. So much of the dialogue is indecipherable. Lastly, theres just way too much exposition, 2/3rds of the movie is spent explaining the dynamics of this world. It feels like overkill.There are a few bright spots though. The plot is very interesting and yield some action scenes, and set pieces which are visually spectacular. And the soundtrack is a+.Disappointed as I was really looking forward to what Nolan had to offer this time around."
3028,"Tenet - 8/10Edit: Gets better with a second viewing, but I've left in my initial review notes that are still applicable.The biggest problem with the film - as many have pointed out - is that it is hard to understand. No, not because the ideas and plot are too complex (keep in mind, I am a big fan of his work) but rather because the story-telling is honestly sloppy at times, especially during the first act. It feels like Tenet is either missing an hour of footage that the studio forced Nolan to remove or it has an hour too much footage that only serves to muddle the plot. Either adding or removing could have fixed this issue. But how it is, the exposition comes in fast and heavy while seemingly pointless actions are being acted out. I just saw the movie yesterday and components of the plot are already slipping away into obscurity - why did he visit the arms dealer? What was the point of the painting? And so on. It all seemed like it was leading from one thing to another without any clear goal in sight and could have all been cut from the final version without missing anything. And as we introduce new characters we never get to know any of them or anything about them and are only convinced that they have any sort of importance because they are played by well-known actors and simply continue to exist on the screen. We are supposed to feel as connection between Washington's and Pattinson's characters but it never becomes apparent why as they never seem to have any sort of chemistry or bonding whatsoever.Of Nolan's strengths it is well known that character development is not among them, nor is getting great performances out of actors - Heath Ledger's Joker being the outlier. He is a much more idea and story centered director and is fabulous at coming up with unique, different, and complex ideas and then crafting equally complex and astounding stories around and through those ideas. Case in point - Inception. A brilliant idea told beautifully with an equally brilliant story that embodies the idea that it is there to present. The ideas in and behind Tenet are equally unique and fascinating, but the story? The story is quite honestly a non-factor. It's muddled, confused, and ill-paced as it breezes by at times and drags at others. So without a sufficient plot of interesting characters we are left only with the idea behind Tenet which is fascinating, but not enough to make this movie worthy of Nolan's reputation.Definitely worth a watch, especially so for ""Nolanites"" but will not have the impact or staying power as Inception, The Prestige, Memento or The Dark Knight. Furthermore, I don't believe it to live up to Interstellar either and possibly even not Dunkirk or Insomnia. Not to say it's his worst film - I leave Following and the Dark Knight Rises to fight for that prestigious title - but farther from his best than his worst. Yet still, a middling Nolan film is good enough to rank as the best film of a catastrophic 2020 thus far. Hopefully, however, we cannot still say the same by the time our Top 10 Films of 2020 lists start coming out."
3029,"Tenet uses the boomerang effect of time delineation, very similar to Nolan's previous film ""Momento"". But time, is dependent on the plot. The plot involves the character's free choice of will, as stated a few times throughout the film, including Neil. Neil, played by Robert Pattinson, gives the greatest range of human emotion and characterization, even within such a fast-paced film. The constant action and reaction, always increasing, along with a unique look at how time works, with masterful editing give the audience an enjoyable experience. However, walking out of the theater the whole viewing seemed pointless. Sure, there were deep moral conflicts and sacrifices, along with love, not just romantic, but refreshingly fraternal love. And yet, in the end the plot held little meaning for me. It showed stereotypical conflicts and resolutions, within a world that only Nolan could design. But as Nolan makes more films there is a hope, I believe, within all of us, that his character's take on a humanity of their own. Instead, especially after watching this film, it felt like leaving a surgery as an intern. There was a body, and all of its parts, its science, and facts, but I never saw a smile, never noticed a tear, and I walked away, knowing that clinically that person is okay, but mentally, spiritually, I will never know. Because I was never given the chance to know. All I did was watch - but never felt."
3030,"Tenet (2020) :
Movie Review -I can say it loud and clear that, we haven't seen something groundbreaking like this before and we may never see something like this. The reason for it is, Tenet is based on a time breaking concept which crosses all the barriers of physics, time flow, inversion, reversion, past, present and future tense. We haven't been introduced to Time-squeezing maneuvers before and in Tenet we get to see multiple dimensions running simultaneously which makes it a crazy visual experience. I mean at one moment it feels like how did they shoot this scene? How did they edited it? How did they even think of writing such a scene? It all goes beyond imagination in this unseen world of Tenet and one must prepare his the brain before watching it because this is going to shake your mind with complexions.The story of Tenet is pretty much predictable and believe me this is an insult of Nolan but the master had some different plans as he tells this predictable story in unpredictable way. A mission of saving the World from extinction is anything but not simple. Tenet is intricate but how much? If i could count it in numbers then it is 11 out 10 i mean one step higher than where your rating ends. When it comes to understanding the film there are different possibilities for sure, like, in first watch you might understand it completely, or you might not understand it and dislike it but then you might understand it in 2nd viewing and find it mind-boggling stuff or something because it is complex indeed. Not just any regular complex show but something really confusing. For instance, i can say that, Inception was lot easier to understand than Tenet and i mean it. I hope you know what i mean, any smart movie buff will surely get it.Tenet has really got lot of good performances from talented cast members. I can't name all but surely the main leading cast is amazing which includes John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki, Kenneth Branagh and other supporting actors. The writing, like I said before crosses all the limits of complexity and it took me a little while to realise what just happened, what did they just said and what was it all about. High chances that Tenet needs to be watched twice to understand all the detailings otherwise you just don't get it properly. Thank god it doesn't leave you with any questions at the end as there is a one solid end to all the theories.Technical aspects of Tenet are truly amazing. The background score will win you over in the opening scene itself and then there are lot of it keep coming up. Cinematography is on some next level as we just can't imagine half the people running backwards and rest half running opposite at the same time. The same goes to the visual team as they achieve artistically groundbreaking visuals which were never seen before and might never be seen in future. Dialogues are too dedal and with the help of Subtitles you can keep them in memory. Director Christopher Nolan has left me speechless yet again. I am not sure about numbers that how many times I've said the same thing. If there was anyone who could have thought of handling hell of a complex film like Tenet then it was only Nolan and nobody else and he didn't disappoint. I am shocked and stunned by his thinking and vision that how every time he comes up with something mind blowing and yet makes it feel mind blowing every time? I mean we never feel fed up by his news ideas and we never even get bored of watching the same film Multiple times. Without a shadow of doubt, Nolan is the best director in the world (of his time) and i am proud to be his Fan.Tenet offers something out of the borders even if you think that you are ready for unlimited features and mind-shaking cinematic graphics. The only problem with Tenet is, it feels soulless after all. The emotional angle doesn't work at any level hence the feelings for the characters never pick. Otherwise, it is a complete package of mind shattering concept, groundbreaking visuals, technical brilliance, atmospheric tension and Nolan's timebreaking vision which makes it a wonderful Cinematic Experience. Highly recommended ""But only for intelligent cine viewers.""RATING - 8/10*"
3031,"While comparing nolan films tenet was only good ,nolan's story structure in tenet awsome."
3032,"If ever a film was going to collapse under the weight of what's expected of it, then it's this one. Nolan's been playing in the big leagues for some time now, and this was always going to be a big-budget summer tentpole type film; now the task it faces is to save the cinema industry. No pressure, then.Given all that, a degree of disappointment is inevitable. This, at the end of August, was my first trip to the cinema since mid-December last year; I've watched plenty of films since then, but none of them in the cinema, Being an immune-suppressed person, I was also nervous - would the cinema be safe for me; would the staff there be COVID compliant. No worries on that latter score, I'm pleased to say. But still, it's very 2020 to come out of the screening to see cleaners in something closely resembling a HAZMAT suit; so one's mind is never entirely at peace.But what of the film? It looks (several) million dollars, of course; we all know Nolan knows how to show you things you've never seen before and could scarcely have imagined in visceral, tangible ways. It starts with a relentless action set-piece and barely stops until the end of the film - even when the scenes are dialogue rather than action-driven, there's a breathless quality to them.Which is just as well, because the plot it all over the place; if you stop to think for a moment you'll see it's not there. I mean, there' s a whole lot of Science (that first letter should be VERY BIG) about entropy and multi-verses and the like. People say they don't understand that, and I know what they mean; but I think what they really mean is that they don't understand the story (because there isn't really one at all); the science makes some degree of sense. I know that because I'm a science idiot who can barely count, with two humanities degrees, and it seemed to make some kind of sense to me scientifically. Endearingly ridiculous, of course, but the science did add up on its own terms in as much as it needed to.But the plot is a bunch of stuff thrown together to give an excuse for some cool action set-pieces to string together. Thanks to Tenet, you haven't seen what a car chase can look like until you've seen this car chase. Trust me; you really haven't seen anything like this before.I understood the peril at stake in the movie - the end of, well, everything. On a micro-scale, there's some stuff about a marriage where abuse is worryingly skipped over, and a bit about some other stuff. But it's the macro that matters here, and there's the rub. Nolan is often criticised for making cold, unemotional films. I think that's unfair; The Prestige is deeply moving, the more so with every rewatch as you gather the full extent of what's going on and what's at stake. I find each of the Batman films moving in their own way, and there are emotional journeys to engage with in Dunkirk. But here? It's all too big to grasp and everything happened without it ever meaning anything for the heart or soul. An aimless ending voiceover suggests an interesting idea about no-one noticing the bombs that don't go off; there's rich thematic material to be mined about doing the stuff no-one notices. But it doesn't land. Stuff will happen and has happened, and that's it. It happens with visual flair and you'll want to see it again, but your heart will be pretty much where it was before you saw it the first time.All of which explains the performances. Everyone seems stilted and a bit wooded; even the always engaging Kenneth Branagh as a VERY BAD person. Even he didn't move me, but I don't think it was the performer's fault. It was just that nothing really connected. Nolan has thus far not made a boring or bad film; this isn't one of those, close as it comes to those twin pitfalls. It's just one to see, forget .... and to see once or twice more for the car chase if nothing else (did I mention it's an incredible car chase?).Where Nolan goes from here, heaven knows. There's no way this, or any other film in cinema history, could do what is asked of this film. Heavy hangs the head, indeed. We all hope, fervently, it does enough to provide the boost on which so many jobs depends. So go see it, for that reason alone if you can. But as Nolan films go, you've seen many better"
3033,"After months and months of being pushed back and rescheduled due to coronavirus, at last Tenet has been released and wow what a film to experience. That is exactly my first overriding feeling after watching Tenet for the first time, it was such a rollercoaster of an experience. This film is full on from start finish and barely slows down even tho its has a sizeable runtime of 2hr 30mins, it definitely didn't feel like that to me.Tenet on first viewing is extremely confusing! This has got to be the most Nolan esq film ever made as if someone else had made it trying to be like Nolan. There is so much that goes on in this film that it is impossible to remember and connect all the dots on just one viewing. So after seeing it a second time and reading some online ending explainers ( I've never had to do that for a film ever until now ) I am pretty convinced that this is going to be a very divisive film. If you are a Nolan fan and like is methods of story telling and film making you are more likely to be on board. If you like strange films with lots of ambiguity then you'll probably find Tenet good too, however if your just a causal film fan I'm not so sure this gonna be for you. I completely understand why.The second viewing for me helped so so much in understanding and answering all the questions I had from watching it the first time. However some part of me thinks that Nolan has made this film overly complex on purpose so you have to see it a second time. Now that is a clever move. So anyone reading this and didn't like it the first time watching it I'd say give it another go because you might start to see everything fall into place.Personally for me I really really enjoyed my experience watching it, my eyes were glued to the screen and my jaw ajar sometimes and the brilliance of the direction. From an action, scope and scale point of view this film has it all and then some, to me it makes all the James Bond and John Wick films look like child's play. Nolan's persistence on using as little CGI as possible definitely makes the experience feel more real and realistic however when CG is used it is done beautifully......the inversion and the final battle fantastic.John David Washington is quickly becoming a major star, this as well as Blackkklansman definitely showing his range as an actor........brilliant in the lead even without a character name. Robert Pattison is on a role at the moment, once again really good in the supporting role behind Washington. Elizabeth Debicki is the heart and soul of the film and delivers a good performance in her limited role. Kenneth Branagh is 100% the correct casting for that villain, blew me away with such a menacing performance. Lastly of course Michael Caine is in this film, even tho its only for a couple of minutes, brilliant as always.Overall I'm gonna give this a soft 8 out of 10 or 80% out of 100 its definitely not one of Nolan's best films but I think thats because its his most inaccessible, you really have to focus when watching this. Outstanding directing as always, fascinating and overly complex story. Two dimensional characters yes I understand the complaint although the backstory is filled in as the film goes along. Action, tension, spectacle, wonder and mystery this really is the definition of a spy thriller on a huge scale. My advice watch it twice because it is definitely worth it !!!!!"
3034,"First film I've seen in the cinema in over six months (due to the Covid lockdown), and it was a humble experience to be back and supporting smaller cinemas in the hope they can keep alive.However, the cinemas need some big films to bring back the audiences, and little better to attract the viewers than a Christopher Nolan film. What we have here is a pseudo-sequel you could say to Inception, and that is a lot to live up to.It's quite a convoluted plot with time travel, and so I won't even attempt to explain it as I may spoil it. You'll find plot holes etc, but I'll leave that to the YouTube reviewers for that analysis.Anyhow, I enjoyed it but it's no big classic. The direction, the pacing and acting is mostly superb BUT the plot is too confusing to understand first time. Maybe repeat viewing is needed. It has wonderful action scenes (Bond-like) and it all keeps in balance without the need to outdo each scene. Well done.The lead actor (John David Washington) is superb as the protagonist trying to stop ""the end of the world"" and is surprisingly wonderfully supported by Robert Pattinson. However, Kenneth Branagh is very cliched/weak as the antagonist in this film, and if anything he could be cringing. Elizabeth Debicki? Not yet been convinced of her in her roles to date, and if anything she has played a role no different to what I've seen her already do in other films.This film though will be one for 'geeks' who will pour over every detail, and a good cerebral film is great news for cinema.BUT will it save cinema? It is very much a step in the right direction. I'd definitely ask people to go watch it, to firstly enjoy the film and help support cinema.There's a long way to go to support cinema, but more like this will definitely keep them relevant & alive as part of our cultural heritage. Thanks Chris Nolan, this film is more important now than ever in this difficult environment."
3035,It is a very very complex film.You may have to watch it 10 times if you have a low iq.But there is no denying that Nolan and his team worked so hard on it.This movie wants us to concentrate on each and every second.Giving it a 10 because it deserves more that 8.5 rating on IMDb.
3036,"If Chris Nolan was a musician this would be his best-of album. If you know who he is, what his style is, the themes he uses, this movie will feel familiar. Here, Nolan is re-using a lot of the same things from his previous movies. If you are not familiar with him then this movie will be a challenging puzzle to decipher. And, it will leave you with more questions than answers.On the surface, the movie is a succession of heist action set-pieces, inter-cut with character development which, for some reason, leans heavily on scenes of domestic abuse. The core of the movie is spectacle. It is a big show. It is fancy lights and impressive sounds. However, the movie is built, not unlike Inception, on a very intricate plot that is challenging to understand. At heart, neither the plot nor the story matters: the movie is an excuse to crash a real-life plane and have bullet impacts in reverse. Yet, the story his build like a Rubik's cube, where the mystery of what is going on is being revealed in a non-linear fashion.I left this movie satisfied and entertained. Technically it is a very good film. No complaints there. However, for all the perfection on the technical level the movie remains quite shallow. That is a criticism of Nolan in general as an artist. He is very competent as a director, but less so a writer. He knows how to tell a story very efficiently, and he is clever enough to construct these high-concept scenarios that challenge the sense of reality and fiction. Yet, this movie does not really have a point. The movie has no meaning. The film is exciting but it is rather dumb. The plot is intricate but who cares really? In other words, the movie has interesting mechanics but has no heart.It is something that I also noticed in Dunkirk. There was no reason really to care for the protagonist of that movie. There needed to be a stronger reason for him to survive: a girlfriend, a family... Similarly there is no prevalent reason for us to care about the protagonist of this movie except for the generic save the world motivation. He has no name, no identifiable attributes, he is barely a character. Halfway through the logical inconsistencies started to turn some scenes into involuntary comedy. All along the movie insists that the fate of the world is at stake, but it is nonchalantly swept aside to save some lady and her son. There is a scene where someone says: ""This will end the world"", the lady asks: ""What about my son?"" I am not happy to laugh at victims of domestic violence but this is what the movie brought out of me.
It is bothering how a movie that is so big in spectacle is so small in story. There are fantastic scenes of helicopters flying in formation and landing down in a war zone while others do the same in reverse. There is an impressive ""war ballet"" in the third act of the movie. Yet, the movie fails spectacularly when it's three people in a room having a conversation. That is the truly mind-bending thing: With a 200 million budget it fails with the scenes that costs nothing.At the end of the day, it feels as if Nolan is trying too hard to impress the audience. It is not because you have time travel that you have a good movie. It is the characters, the motivations and the tension. I was more impressed by Palm Springs, than I was by Tenet. It almost feels that the science fiction stuff was added to mask the emptiness of the story.SPOILERS: In the third act Nolan gives the keys to understand the plot. The ""whole thing"" was a temporal pincer movement. With the red and blue motif being present from the start. There, you don't need to watch it a second time."
3037,"Would folks be raving about this film as much...In my opinion it's similar to Once upon a time in Hollywood. If it wasn't Tarantino, there'd be star or two less in the reviews.The premise of the story is good; the special effects excellent, but (for me) the second half of the film gets too confusing and at times it could do with tighter editing.Other reviewers suggest, or have undertaken, a second viewing to better make sense of everything. And that might help.Could be a new tactic to increase box office revenue...."
3038,Im not that smart! But for me it was a bit confusing. But i loved every second of the movie!
3039,"It's very imaginative, impressive and very complicated. I need to see it again!"
3040,"As always when it comes to those hyped movies I ask myself will it live up to the high expectations? To me it doesn't. It is a good movie though. The acting of all main characters is good and is topped by Kevin Branagh's outstanding performance. But it is not top notch worth 10 points. Maybe I expected something like those never before seen visuals as in Inception. I also expected the concept 'Tenet' (what is it anyway?) to be picked up and detailed throughout the movie, but it didn't.
As for the time travel aspects of the movie I don't know if I understood them completely. Maybe it is worth a second watch as stated in other comments. But I don't know if I will give it another try. Maybe it is the slow pace at the beginning which may be boring on a second view.
The thing I expected least was that it could be watched as a Bond movie, as there are many ingredients as: The bad guy who wants to destroy the world, his female lover to which our protagonist develops a relationship, nice places all over the world, the climax in which the bad is defeated, over the top stunts, the main character being introduced to several bad guys, dining with them and being threatened at the same time, ...
So overall it is a good movie but not what I expected and not that great it deserved a 10 rating."
3041,"This film is hard to follow , but that's the point .
Complicated and interesting .
Science fiction , intrigue, action .
Might need to watch this a couple of times just to fully comprehend the science . Entertains nevertheless. You'll walk out the theatre trying to figure out what was happening ."
3042,"John David Washington & Pattinson are a great duoBest way to describe this movie: modern spy movie. The visuals are sensational a technical masterclass.
Looking forward to how this ages, as divisive as most Nolan films, when this hits streaming some of the complaints will disappear."
3043,"I heard that they were using a lot of terms where you could use a dictionary. So i did a little bit of research on the web and watched some videos about the movie on youtube, without any spoilers of course.Im happy that i did this, so i could get the movie at the first time and you can place a lot of some pieces in the right place.For anyone who are willing to watch this movie! Have fun and stay tuned during the whole movie"
3044,The film is just perfect. The set design is amazing and the film music/sound is so good!!!
3045,"There are very few directors/writers that bring truly unique concepts to the big screen these day's. Yet Nolan manages it time and time again, leaving audiences blown away by the originality of his art.
Tenet sends you on a rollercoaster ride that barely gives in at any point, making you question every scene and characters choice of actions. The complexity of this film for most people will surely demand a second watching, as if you blink you will miss it.
The acting is incredible from all cast members. Like Tarantino, Nolan seems to have a clear idea of which actors will be perfect for any particular film.
I really enjoyed this, leaving plenty for my friends and I to discuss/debate/question in the pub afterwards."
3046,"Tenet is realy realy good, except it's not.Visuals, scoop and scale are of the chart.
The story is a little complex but the time inversion aspect is Extremely cool.The only thing missing is true emotion and or heart.I loved it, i wanna see it again.But compared to inception it's not that Great."
3047,"Lighthearted rom-com in the pattern of 90ies 'boy meets girl, boy loses girl and time paradoxes ensue'. 5\7"
3048,"Upon relaxing in my cinema seat to watch the highly anticipated epic from the acclaimed and renowned Christopher Nolan, I was immediately struck by the palpable atmosphere and the viscerally beautiful sound, cinematography and score that radiated around the room. After witnessing Dunkirk, Nolan's last film, I had wrongly assumed that he couldn't deliver an experience as cinematic and enthralling as the outstanding war epic and I withheld this belief until I was absorbed by the complex, layered world of Tenet which takes full use of all the theatres have to offer.First I shall mention just a few of the many, many positives and advantages of the this intriguing thriller:1. The Direction is once again inspiring, groundbreaking and profusely impressive, everything from the camerawork in the more quiet, introspective exchanges to the visual queues and general execution of the 'Inverted' action sequences and the intricately designed set pieces are directed ingeniously and work cooperatively with the dangerously complex script to provide an excellent display of Christopher Nolan's expertise.2. The Astonishing Score which was composed by the immensely talented Ludwig Göransson could easily be mistaken for something written by Nolan's usual collaborator Hans Zimmer and provokes reactions that include excitement, sadness, joy and intensity all in necessary amounts,3. Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography is a gorgeous and stupefyingly stunning display of insuperably beautiful colour grading and incredible camerawork.4. Although flawed and in certain areas underwhelming and undercooked, the script is expectedly intelligent, complex and perplexedly imaginative, inventive and rich and boldly throws itself headfirst into the lore of it's own creation and emerges victorious in providing an exciting and powerful puzzle that juggles the insurmountable narrative with seamless ease. For example what I can only describe as the inverted rooms scenario where Sator would interrogate The Protagonist with information he had inadvertently fed him beforehand in the 'Blue Room' and then uncover originally moments later in the 'Red Room"" in present day before alternating back upon noticing the reversed expression of his own face in the 'Blue Room' to start the interrogation all over again but in a loop and using information that the Protagonist was yet to give but already being blackmailed with.5. The Action is breathtaking and some of the best I've seen and never failed to both wow and entertain me throughout which is in part due to the sensational visual, technical and special effects.6. Although there are many, many more triumphs and successes when regarding the film as whole, there are also a few glaring issues which I will reference now.One of the few glaring issues that haunt what is an astoundingly persistent technical achievement is not the film's total absence of emotion but 'The Protagonist', a character that is utterly devoid of inner conflict, a character that despite an exceedingly charismatic and in actuality brilliant performance from John David Washington provides no captivating motivation for the audience to care and lacks the necessary and expected turmoil to be even half as good as Nolan's usual protagonists. Furthermore whilst I am on the topic of emotion and conflict, nearly all of said emotion is derived from Elizabeth Debicki's character, Kat, the soul of the film and the soul motivation for 'The Protagonist' who fascinatingly establishes a relationship that is dissimilar to the core relationships in most espionage or spy films, a relationship that is built on the empathy of 'The Protagonist' and the sympathy he feels for her rather than forced sexual attraction. Other than the character of Kat and the estranged relationship she withholds with her son, the film lacks emotion and is therefore driven by the performances of the lead actors which fortunately are excellent and amazingly dynamic (Even if Kenneth Branagh's portrayal of the villain is slightly campy).Another glaring issue is the overabundance of exposition which is more prevalent in this film than in any of Nolan's previous pictures and continues the trend that started with The Dark Knight Rises of expository action scenes. Contrarily these expository scenes are contradicted by yet another flaw the film displays which involves the apparent lack of logic with certain choices, especially when regarding emotion and the lost opportunities because of said lack of logic (For example our not seeing the young boys reaction to his father, Sator, being dead or the total omission of an interaction involving Kat and her son after the battle was won).The final impediment to the film is underwhelming and frankly disappointing exclusion of more prevalent and powerful theme, metaphors and ideas which have become synonymous with Nolan's thoughtful and socially aware blockbusters. Whereas Inception had something to say about the unruly escapism of drug taking, the avoidance of responsibility and the inaccessibility of a guilty conscious or a preoccupied, over-idealistic mind, this film's themes are present but not developed enough and therefore don't imprint a lasting impression on the viewer or all those that wish to have something truly think about upon leaving the cinema.Overall, despite a frustrating deficiency of both motivation, emotion and truly integral themes and an overabundance of exposition, Tenet still provides an intelligent, creative and imaginative script, extraordinary direction, gorgeous cinematography and camerawork, an unbelievable score and viscerally brilliant and dynamic action amongst many, many other advantages and pros that make this film more than worth the watch.9.1/10"
3049,"A Nolan film through and through, with plenty of his trademark style, spectacle and anxiety inducing bass heavy soundtrack. The action scenes are spectacular and cleverly put together, the acting is great and the plot comes together superbly by the end, but there is a lot of muddled exposition and the editing leaps make it harder to follow than it should be. In hindsight, the plot isn't really that complicated, but the presentation and subject matter overcomplicate things, and throughout it pushes you out of your comfort zone and really makes you think at times."
3050,Yuh (i have to add more words bcz it's saying my reply is too short)
3051,"Firstly, I watched this with my partner who isn't really into movies you have to follow every second of and at the end she just didn't care anymore.The concept is great and like inception, Nolan has made a visually stunning and awesome movie to activate the brain.The storyline in the first 30 minutes bounces along so quickly and with some key lines to progress the plot being delivered so fast and with such poor quality that they were able to be quickly missed.The score for the movie was, in my opinion, absolutely ridiculous. Loud, deep and painfully drawn out tones over all dialogue made it confusing to follow also.Kenneth Branagh was quite good but the real standout was Robert Pattinson as a likeable sidekick/partner who always leads on to know more than he should with a good character arc.Overall the forward and ""inverse"" time concept was amazing with stunning visuals and with more focus on dialogue this movie could be an 8+ but I was struggling to keep up and my partner was utterly lost."
3052,"If you like Nolan then you will like this film. You should expect lots of pseudo exposition. A big score and tight action sequences.
I do feel however this didn't quite make the summit. Inception is incredibly high on my list of favourite movies the perfect marriage high concept idea married to a great plot with interesting characters and action scenes that are totally fresh.This film feels like the younger brother in his older ones shadow. It's immensely entertaining but as other reviewers have stated characters here feel a bit one dimensional.
Ken Branagh didn't convince me that he was any more evil than Hugh Laurie in the night manager ironically similar due to Elizabeth Debicki pretty much playing the same role in both features.Perhaps that's the problem all the Nolan tropes are here but it falls slightly flat due to lack of engagement with the actors. Everything else is amazing. Again action sequences will remind you of what you've seen in Inception.
How did he do that moments are here. The finale is the films strong point when the dual timelines converge.A film that well worth watching strong overall but fell down in some areas. Maybe it will gain more appreciation on repeat watches.
Somehow I don't think I will see it as often as Inception"
3053,Didn't ully understand it (even allowing for the time shifting concept some things didnt make sense) but it didn't matter. I just enjoyed the action sequences and assumed that it all made sense to someone. Definitely needs subtitles - we didn't hear lots of lines through the film.
3054,I want new Nolan. I don't want old and have seen it before Nolan.
3055,"I did enjoy the film, and while the plot is at times a little hard to keep up with, it's far from being ""impossible to follow"" as some previous reviews have claimed.
The action set pieces are excellent and the music fits very well.
It's far from being Nolan's best, but that's never going to be anything to be ashamed of when you look at his epic back catalogue, but it's still a very good film from one of the best filmmakers of this generation"
3056,"Overall it is a solid Nolan movie. The plot is decent and engaging. The mo is is quick, with enough breathing pauses. Camera work, music, cinematography, acting and scenery is great. The story broke my mind trying to figure out how everything intertwines exactly. Just like with Inception, I'll have to rewatch it a couple of times before I completely got it.
Because of this however it didn't feel amazing, coming out of the theater. I definitely don:t regard it as one of his best. Playing with time is his signature but he usually combines this with amazing cinematography so you are still amazed the first time through. I didn't feel this was the case with this one. It's great, don't get me wrong, but it's not what we are used to from interstellar, inception or Dunkirk.
In short: a solid Nolan movie, definitely recommended to watch, but not his best. (My opinion might change once I completely understand the storyline)"
3057,"Do not try to understand it, just feel it. Masterpiece"
3058,"I watched this movie only once and I can tell that this movie isn't such good like Inception, Interstellar or The Dark Knight but it's smarty (not like Nolan's other movies), charming and cool sci-fi with Washington, Pattinson and famous Michael Caine (or not)."
3059,"We saw it in Germany in IMAX and this movie is another masterpiece from Nolan.
I am looking forward to watch it second and third time to see all those puzzle pieces coming together and to enjoy it fully!"
3060,"...but I'd expect more from Nolan!
Very far from the character development of his early movies, the screenplay and the dialogues are also two levels below Memento, the Prestige or Inception.The film is entertainment at its best, stimulates the viewer's brain to follow the plot and it's twists, the cinematography and the music score are awesome (yes here you can tell there is a master behind the camera).In my opinion, the main flaw of the film is the lack of motivation of the characters. Why would the protagonist embrace this odissey in first place? For a girl he barely knows? To ""save the world"" because someone told him to?I will remember this movie for the beautiful scenes: the shooting at the concert, the back and forth in the hallways. I will try to forget entropy, and all those fancy word out of context.8/10"
3061,"Tenet is a new Sci-Fi action movie directed and written by Christopher Nolan, the director of The Dark Knight trilogy, Inception and Dunkirk.In the movie, a CIA agent (John David Washington) is recruited by a secret organization called Tenet. Here he learns about a hidden cold war between America and Russia, which can influence time through new technologies. This way they can catch their bullets instead of firing them.
To prevent World War III, the CIA must stop Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh), a renegade Russian oligarch. He has foreknowledge of how he can influence time with time inversion for bad and dangerous purposes. The CIA must also train with time inversion to avoid threats to the world.Christopher Nolan had the idea for Tenet in mind and planning for 20 years. He wrote the final script for the film in the past five years. In one of his first directed 2000 films Memento, Nolan also played with the subject of time. It is nice to see how Nolan now, after 20 years, processes the subject of time in a different way in his film. There are scenes in the movie that take place both forward and backwards. To convey these scenes properly, Nolan recorded each scene twice: once in progress and one where everything happens backwards.A fan of the James Bond film series, Nolan has incorporated the espionage genre into this film too, without copying ideas or story aspects from any of the James Bond films. Due to the mix of the espionage genre and the variation in time in the film, the film comes across as a modern, original mix between James Bond and Back to the Future.Christopher Nolan did not use a green screen or CGI for this film. All images were filmed on location and made with practical effects. The explosions and action scenes in the film are all real and credible. For this, they even crashed and exploded a real 747 plane in a hangar.The acting is also done well and credibly by the cast. The cast had to play all scenes both forward and back once. For this they also had to learn how to speak in reverse. Cast members were only allowed to go through the script in rooms so that no details of the films before the film's release could be shared with the world. Due to the corona pandemic, the film could not be released in theaters until months later, and all details and secrets of the film had to be well hidden from the world.Despite the fact that John David Washington largely goes through the film as characters without a name, he knows how to carry the film well as the main character. Together with Robert Pattinson they play a good spy duo, who research and investigate the art of time inversion. Elizabeth Debicki also plays well the wife of the villain's villain, with whom you don't always know if she can be trusted. Sometimes her character is written a bit too selfishly, which can irritate you if she seems to compromise the mission. Kenneth Branagh also plays the villain of the story well. Despite his character posing a threat to world peace, they have nevertheless given his character a good reason for his actions."
3062,"A film that deserves to be experienced on the biggest screen and with the loudest speakers. Tenet is the example of a master filmmaker taking one of his favorite genres and merging it with his own style and obsessions. I think in this particular project Nolan let himself have fun with the concept of his film instead of trying to create something that matches the seer originality of Inception. It's more of him working on a genre (the spy genre) and putting his own spin to it instead of trying to re-invent it like he did with the war genre in Dunkirk. The characters don't really have the depth of Cobb or Cooper and the film cares more in being an action heavy espionage thriller with a sci-fi twist (a great spectacle) instead of trying to combine the powerful emotional cores other Nolan films have. Tenet has some really ambitious ideas but it doesn't execute them in an equally ambitious way but rather presents us with a very simple story that acts as the parallel for the film's existential themes. I also hoped that there would be an escalation after the reveal of who John David's character is fighting in an iconic scene (similarly to how they went from 2 dream levels to 3 in Inception) but I didn't feel the film built to something that brilliant again after that. Maybe because it was the only inverted sequence that we fully witnessed from both perspectives. I loved Pattinson's role even though his character wasn't particularly rich and the reveal at the end was strong and it kinda worked as the film's emotional payoff. Not as good as the payoff of Inception (Cobb returning home) Interstellar (Cooper is the ghost) or Dunkirk (the 3 timelines perfectly converging and coming to an end) but pretty good writing that really completed the puzzle that was there from the beginning. I think Nolan wanted to make his own action epic espionage thriller in a way that it resembles his style and in the end he did just that. Is it as good as most of his films? No. Is it confusing? Hell yeah it is. But it is well made, brilliantly shot with Hoyte's cinematography being exceptional as always and it also is a very ambitious film that has its moments of brilliance and awe. I can see many people (passionate film scholars and writers) being inspired by Tenet's gradiosity without necessarily being one of Nolan's best films. It doesn't have to be...especially with a filmography like his. In the end, there are no loosens when the credits role. There are ambiguities sure but they are well constructed (not as well as that spinning top in Inception though). There are problems one could have after watching Tenet but its energy and great craftsmanship prevent it from falling apart. What Sergio Leone did with ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" & ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" for the western, Nolan did with Tenet for the spy genre. It's his love letter to action, espionage thrillers but on his own epic and mind bending terms. Original Rating: 8/10 (Good)
Edit: Having seen the film multiple times, I see a filmmaker who demonstrates his love for cinema in an age where sequels, prequels and reboots dominate the box office with digital technology completely replacing film and CGI completely watering down the cinematic experience. In a way, Tenet is a modern North by Northwest, a crazy, thrilling adventure that grabs you from the start and never lets you go as the situation and concept take over with Nolan's style and brilliant sequences (even if they are mathematichally complex) providing a James Bond-epic scale spectacle with a very original and creative idea that transcends character backstories and conventional storytelling methods. Would I have liked the film to be way more character driven? I sure would. Is the situation and concept of the film enough? Yes. I still think Tenet isn't the Masterpiece Interstellar, Inception, Dunkirk (and other Nolan films) are but when I sat down trying to think of original films that create their own world and rules and play by them to the extend and brilliance Tenet does, I thought of so few ones and most of them were products of the 20st century. Even thought it's needlessly complex sometimes, Tenet challenges the viewer and takes him into a world of brilliant ideas, epic scale, glorious and creative action all crafted with a top tier filmmaking virtuosity.
Exceptional: 9/10"
3063,"Some may say this movie is too confusing. Sure, if your not into movies in which you have to think about what's going on (being a Nolan movie not sure why you'd watch it if this is the case) then this probably isn't the film for you. It's not your usual just sit back and watch what's happening. You really have to think about what is happening, really get stuck into the film. If you can do this, then you'll love TENET.I'm not going to pretend I understood everything that went on through the 2 hours 30 minutes, but I understood enough to know what was happening. If there's something you don't fully understand while watching it for the first time, don't think too hard in the moment, just accept that *something* has happened. The story works itself out in the end and you'll be able to understand the main plot. To be able to really understand the finer plot details, you'll need to rewatch it, probably several times.The bonus of rewatching to fully understand the finer details is you get to enjoy the incredible action sequences all over again. They actions sequences are immense, especially the one featuring time inversion in some way.I thought the acting throughout was great, Kenneth Branagh really stood out for me, really suits the roll of a bad guy very well. John David Washington put in a brilliant lead performance. I feel like Robert Pattinson seems to be the top choice for movies at the moment, and I can see why, I can't wait to see him as The Batman.Overall TENET is a very complex, but very rewarding story with outstanding action sequences. Multiple viewings aren't required, but I would strongly recommend them to be able to understand everything happening in every scene. I can't wait for it to be released on digital so I can really explore it deeper. Once again, Christopher Nolan has delivered."
3064,"It's weird to finally be watching a movie in the cinema after so long but Tenet was a film that I have been wanting to watch for ages! I am a huge fan of Christopher Nolan and watch nearly every single film that he has made. Even his less well-received movies such as ""Interstellar"" still wowed me in some capacity. Dunkirk, his previous movie, disappointed in some ways and not because it was bad, far from it, but because it was rather tamed and grounded compared to his crazy, mind-bending movies such as Inception. Tenet was him bringing back this craziness and return to the time concept again. The question though is if this film was worth returning to the cinema for? The premise is simple, a secret agent embarks on a dangerous, time-bending mission to prevent the start of World War III.Firstly, I got to praise the originality of this movie. Yes, it is a spy espionage movie and borrows a lot of element from the previous movies of the like. However, the use of ""Inversion"" really adds a layer on top of this movie and makes it feel like no other movie has. This ""inversion"" is best seen in the action sequences which result in some visually stunning spectacles. On that note, the action sequences are phenomenal from the car chase to the plane crash and my favourite being the fight scene between the protagonist and an inversion soldier. It's even more impressive when you realise that most of these action scenes are practical and not CGI which benefits the movie by not taking the audience out of it and keeping as glued to what's going on.Unfortunately, legendary composer Hans Zimmer does not return for Tenet and is instead replaced by Ludwig Göransson of Black Panther and Mandalorian fame. Despite that, Ludwig gives an impressive electronic score that elevates every scene and is deafening in a good way. If you didn't know Hans Zimmer was not scoring this movie and watched it, you still probably would think Hans Zimmer was still scoring it.The story is also intriguing enough to keep the audience engaged. It is simple with the agents having to prevent the ""Russian"" bad guy from dooming the world! However, the inclusion of inversion does add an extra element to the plot and makes the audience think about the movie. Even after it was finished, I was still thinking about the movie. The inversion adds an element of unpredictability to the movie and starts to change the way the movie operates. However, this inversion doesn't take focus until halfway through the movie. For the first hour, it is just a spy espionage movie with a lot of exposition and setup but the second half goes into high gear and is when it gets really good.The actors are for the most part give really good performances. Special mention to Elizabeth Debicki as ""Kat"" who gives a emotive performance of a woman who is practically in a domestically abusive relationship. John David Washington as ""The Protagonist"" (yes seriously...) has the suave and coolness from an agent spy, Robert Pattinson as ""Neil"" gives a lot of charm and wit to his performance and Kenneth Branagh as ""Andrei Sato"" is frightening in his performance as the villain.One major flaw about the movie, in my opinion, is the characterisation. You can already see this when the main character's name is never mentioned whatsoever in the movie. Apart from Kat (Elizabeth Debicki ) and Neill (Robert Pattinson), to a certain extent, are very bland and one dimensional. The protagonist (John David Washington) is the ""good guy"" and doesn't have anything else from that. We don't know his backstory, his feelings or even his real name for that matter. The character doesn't even have that big of a reaction to the inversion thing either and can feel rather robotic. Andrei Sato (Kenneth Branagh) suffers from a similar aspect to the protagonist is an over the top Russian bad guy and wants to end the world and wants to control his wife. There are some other supporting characters introduced in the movie and sadly they also are lacking in depth. The only emotive aspect in this movie is the abusive relationship between Kat and Andrei Sato. However, apart from that the movie very lacking in a lot of humanity and emotional moments.The second major flaw is the sound mixing in this movie. The voices of the actors are just so muffled or rather low sometimes which makes it hard to hear what they are saying. This gets even more difficult when the characters are wearing a mask or have incredibly strong accents like Kenneth's Russian accent. Occasionally, the loud music score is really loud during conversations between characters. This is quite detrimental to the movie as every dialogue is really important to understanding the movie and not being able to hear it because of weird sound mixing is not great.A minor flaw is the ""inversion"" explanation. It is still quite confusing to understand and while it is explained in the movie to a certain extent, it can still leave you rather confused and dumbfounded. It isn't a major problem as it gives a rough idea of the concept and in the end, this rough understanding is all that's needed to enjoy the movie. Just like a character says in the movie ""Don't try to understand it, Feel it"". Although, that is kind of a blatant reason for the director to not explain everything...Overall, the movie was a blast to watch. It is a bit weaker compared to Nolan's previous movies but is still stunning to watch. It is a grandly entertaining movie that is an absolute spectacle. I highly recommend considering watching it in a theatre as this movie is the best experienced there in all its glory."
3065,"My spoiler free review. The sound nearly blew my face off and through the course of the film I felt I was going to be vibrated out of my seat. This film is a nutso bonkers incomprehensible masterpiece of temporal mayhem. Most of the time I didn't know what was happening or why it was happening. Will need multiple viewings accompanied by commentary from an expert physicist. Watch it in the cinema or don't watch it. Erm... really good, I think..."
3066,".. it was massive news to Tallinn, Estonia as a lot of it was filmed in Tallinn. Also A LOT of estonians had a chance to be extra in this movie, I was also the lucky one..I am not gonna lie, the storyline is not my cup of tea but I throughly enjoyed the movie since I could not believe it was the tram I take every day or the cafe I go to that was shown in the movie. Also our language Estonian was in it!"
