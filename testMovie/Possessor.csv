0,"... not only in the main characters but channelling throughout this unoriginal take on nothing you haven't seen before but perhaps with a bit more gore, torment and brutality, although you're never really sure why and you'll find a point close to the middle when you won't really care - valueless with some reasonable effects."
1,"In this film, set in the near future, brain implant technology allows one person to inhabit the mind, body, and spirit of another. A clandestine corporation uses this technology to assassinate wealthy and powerful people for profit. The film explores what happens when the host starts to fight to regain control from a guest who is not entirely mentally stable, to begin with.Interesting enough premise. The film is set in a very bleak version of the future where cities appear to be sparsely populated (perhaps from some event that greatly reduced the population such as plague or war; a motif borrowed from Argento's Tenebre). The film relies heavily on psychotropic imagery, and this adds to the overall frightening and confusing atmosphere since most of this imagery is nightmarish (distorted faces reminiscent of David Cronenberg's The Brood, warped colors, bursts of sound and images, blurs, rapid-fire images and strobing flashes of light). The film further relies on ultra-violence as a motif that rivals even the Italian slasher films of the late 1970s and early 80s (such as Susperia, Tenembre, Opera, etc.). Possessor contains explicit sexual motifs including full male nudity and erect penises, which reminds me very much of Antichrist (2009) or The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976). These are juxtaposed with explicit imagery of knives penetrating flesh. All of this results in a nightmare landscape. The ending is purposely left confusing so that that the viewer can arrive at their own conclusions. For some viewers, this will be frustrating.All of this wraps up into a very worthwhile enough film, but for viewers with a more sophisticated palate (if you are looking for a Blumhouse type film Possessor is not what you are looking for). It is disturbing to be sure. However, it is very well made and anchored by two very outstanding performances from Andrea Riseborough and Christopher Abbott. It also features Jennifer Jason Leigh and Sean Bean in very laudable supporting roles (whether or not Sean Bean dies I will not spoil). Possessor is a ""Criterion Collection"" caliber film that will give the viewer some satisfaction analyzing and will with you long after you see it."
2,"This should be retitled,""Too Much but also not enough"". There are so many ideas pulling the movie in so many different directions. It's ideas the movie, but rarely does an idea get fully realized here. This has me torn on how I feel. On one hand, there is a unique tone to this. It's like Assassin's Creed meets inception. People possessing other people's bodies to preform hits on specific people for political or social gain is a solid premise on it's own. Throw in some great ultra violent gore effects, good performances, and some moody, atmospheric music and you get some really striking scenes. On the other hand, the movie is overly ambitious. There's so much it establishes there's no way it can accomplish it all, and it doesn't. This is exemplified in the first act which feels horribly rushed. We get less then 20 minutes establishing characters, premise, and themes. It feels like it can't wait to move through the set up and what results is a lack of investment from me. We hardly know who anyone is or why they are doing anything. The main character is having a psychological melt down as a result from over working inside this possessor machine but she only takes like a half day off to recover. Then she's right back to work. There's barely motivation for this and in her half day off all she does is sit around at home with her ex. You needed more scenes explaining to us what lead to her breaking up with him and more establishment of why she would want to go back to him. We don't know these people or their story and we leave them so quickly it's hard to care about them at all. We literally get one scene of her away from her work, and it's nothing out of the ordinary as far as normal day goes. Why is she a workaholic? Her home life seems fine to me. Why won't she tell her superiors that she's having a mental breakdown? Is it supposed to be a metaphor about her dependency on work to avoid her real life? If that's the case then why don't we get more scenes showing why she would be avoiding her life? It's a messy movie, full of vague characters and even murkier story progression. Even though the first act is rushed, at least it sets some interesting things up. The second act is where the movie really faulters though. It feels like the same scenes happening over and over again. It gets really tedious watching a character saying the possessed person is acting weird over and over. There are some cool, trippy, drug like sequences showing the main character having more internal breakdowns but I got the point after the first time. Yeah she's not stable enough to be in there and the longer she is, the worse it will get. I get it. We don't need to see it 27 times. This is weird because the first act has the exact opposite problem. Like Inception these people are trying to accomplish something by manipulating others for their gain. Unlike Inception, where the first half of the movie is establishing characters, story motivations, and potential speed bumps, Possessor only seems interested in establishing the story speed bumps. We don't get a clear sense of character motivation or why the story is happening in the first place. This possessor company wants to own this large tech company? But why? Who knows! The real story is about the Possessor and the Possessy who go to war over who should have control over the body. So why even mention that they want to absorb this tech company? Instead, say that she needs to kill these people just because they are evil or corrupt. That wouldn't change what the movie is going for and it would clean up the story a bit. The whole point is the struggle between the possessed dude and the possessor and coming to terms with the horrible things that happened. It's kinda like watching someone with split personality disorder. Which, again, is an idea that could've and should've been fleshed out. It only comes up near the end and is wrapped up so quickly I don't know why they even bothered. The first act is completely rushed, the second act is drawn out to no end, and the third act introduces more things it can't quite pull off. So...eh?*2nd viewing edition*
I liked this way more on second watch. Maybe it's the uncut version or maybe I just got it this time. The biggest theme explored is the idea that sometimes it's hard to tell who we really are. Are we so inspired by others to do things that we end up losing our sense of self? You could interpret this as a meditation on mental illness but I see it as every day life. The culture is so saturated by ""hot takes"", opinions, and people ""looking out for our best interest"" that it can truly be numbing. The disassociation we can feel could be as simple as everyday little things to life altering marriage. Who knows if we love them or if someone we love loves them for us. This is all beautifully captured and comes around full circle at the end. Again, it's possible I just didn't get it the first time around but, this uncut version somehow feels tighter. I was transfixed by it. The first act flows nicely, the second act escalates well, and the climax is thoroughly satisfying. Man, I think I feel a third viewing coming..."
3,"There aren't enough people doing this kind of stuff anymore, you know, the kind of movies David Cronenberg used to do, low budget but well crafted, high concept and not afraid to disturb, then lo and behold, looks like his son took the torch and I couldn't be happier. Possessor has some great performances and nice visual choices, the body horror bits do not disappoint as well and I thought the narrative was engaging from start to finish, found no issues with the pacing whatsoever.We need more creative works like this on horror-fantasy."
4,"... that's pretty much it. It just looks good. Well, the acting is alright too, i guess. The pacing is way too slow, literally 2/3 could've been cut into a 12 minutes run time. Though the concept is nice, they didn't able to make an interesting plot (if even there's any plot at all). The ""weird imagery"" and ""violent"" that sole purpose to make it edgy-artsy, didn't work. It ended up boring and dull."
5,"Similar in ways to existenz and videodrome themes. Really been missing David Cronenberg as he hasnt made many movies recently, so glad to see his sons taken over. His films are getting much better, this one being my favourite by miles so far. Excellent use of London set, nice camera work and its a real gorefest. It doesnt hold back in that respect, and some of the visual dream sequences were 1st class. Its not a perfect film by any means but has a number of strengths that horror film fans will appreciate."
6,"Possessor reminds me of an ultra-violent combination of Inception and Looper.It's about an assassin who uses body-hoping technology to kill her targets before terminating the body she's co-opted.The movie does not do a lot of explaining, we open up with an assassination in a swanky hotel where one of the staff is manipulated to kill a guest before security guards gun her down.Then we see the protagonist (I use the word loosely) Taysa Vos, played by Andrea Riseborough, was controlling the body of the killer from a safe distance. Vos works for a secretive company that offers these kind of closed-loop assassinations. Side bar: Taysa Vos sounds like it could be a name from the Star Wars universe, or is it just me?The process of changing bodies seems to take away from her sense of self. She takes a test after each job where she recognizes objects from her past and identifies the one that doesn't belong. When she visits her family, she has to practice sounding like herself -- as if she's rehearsing lines.What follows is a kaleidoscope of violence and surreal, dreamy imagery filmed in a cold, deliberate style. Lots of indie movies today go for this kind of neon/midnight movie mixed with Kubrick aesthetic, but Possessor pulls it off better than most.Vos is supposed to possess the body of Colin Tate (Christopher Abbott) to murder his girlfriend and her CEO father (Sean Bean) before offing himself to tie up the loose end.It goes wrong, but not in the way I expected. I'd recommend this to people who enjoy mindbenders along the lines of Primer, Triangle, or Upstream Color and can put up with a bit of seize-in-your-seat gore."
7,"This movie is unsettling. To its credit, that is partially due to its commitment to the relentlessly bleak and bloody life of Tasya, a woman whose job is to use a strange machine that lets her inhabit other people's bodies to carry out violent assassinations. The film truly conveys the dread of an alternate universe where such a thing exists. The audience is in a strange position at the edge of the seat waiting to see how this woman and her overlords' missions go, yet also wondering if we should be hoping for their own demise given the immorality of their scheme. It doesn't help that Tasya herself seems perturbed about her own actions.Unfortunately, the film is also unsettling for a number of negative reasons. Firstly, it is grotesque. It features ridiculously gory violence and pornographic imagery, including a scene where a child is shot and killed and highly explicit sex scenes. These kinds of elements can be appropriate when crafting a film, but the creators of this film are highly egotistical to think that they have the skill to use these elements as anything more than shock value.Secondly, the actual writing of the film is lazy. It is premised on a fascinating science-fiction concept of using technology to control other people and have them carry out violence for you, but that is the only substance to the film. None of the people in the film seem like living humans; they are just there to either kill or be killed. There is no way to connect with or care about anyone in the film, except when you feel sorry for them being brutalized so viciously or wish they would stop committing such heinous acts. Very few things are justified in the movie. Why, in a world that mostly seems to be just like our own, do they have this incredible ability for one person to take control of another's body? Who exactly is doing this? How would this be worth it, given the monetary, legal, and ethical liabilities? Why would anyone agree to do this? Why does no one notice? Why are the victims left alone so much, without anyone there to help them? This mystifying world is actually just an empty world, like a notepad with only two pages of notes and the rest is blank.Finally, the movie veers into government-granted film student cheese. While it is stylisticly interesting in some ways, it also features a constant soundtrack of grating royalty-free ""creepy"" music and features a lot of ""eerie"" filler footage. At the supposed climax, it devolves to the point of plopping loud, scary sounds onto otherwise laughable scenes with melting masks and spooky scenes flashing by.Possessor is highly dedicated to some sort of goal to unsettle us. Unfortunately, it just isn't clear what the purpose is, and therefor it is not justified in being so grotesque and unenjoyable. It joins a growing legacy of films which collect grants from multiple countries, go to print, and then get tossed in the rubbish cause no one cares."
8,"Ok, i don't usually write reviews here, although I am an avid movie fanatic.To be frank i wasn't familiar with Brandon Cronenberg and his work up until now, and I must say this is a treat for the fans of his Dad's work.The beginning is kind of meh I admit and nothing special but from the mid point towards the end it keeps getting better and better and the main thing is the beautiful atmosphere and cinematography and visuals and practical effects in the style of 80s masterpieces of his famous father.This is by far the most interesting movie in this ""subgenre"" of horror in years and maybe even from the 80s/90s and since David shifted more towards the ""mainstream"" if that is something you can ever say about David Cronenberg.Also the acting is great as is the casting. The colors and the mood of the film are really on point. Shot out to Director of photography.To top it all of the ""ending theme"" or ""possessor"" as it is credited in the soundtrack by Jim Williams is nothing short of a masterpiece.If you loved David Cronenberg's ""Videodrome"" or ""The Scanners"" or even ""Dead Ringers"" you will surely appreciate this one..Do not be thrown away by the bad reviews and take a look for yourself!"
9,"I rarely write reviews on IMDB, but since there is so little info out there on this film, I decided to add my two cents. I feel like this film has great potential, much like an episode of Black Mirror. Unfortunately, there are far too many unanswered questions in this film.Spoilers....maybe:Why are these assassinations taking place? Who is behind them? What happens when the process goes smoothly, considering we are only shown what happens when the process goes haywire? I could go on....This movie feels unfinished (maybe it is?). The horror is there, the sci-fi is there, the creativity is there, it just needs someone to step in and tie it all together."
10,"I just found the whole movie wrong from the opening scene. The look was off, the pacing was slow, the sound track was tedious and slow panning shots... I simply detest slow panning shots with ambient music. It was an extremely drawn out affair, interjected with frantic disjointed scenes of of graphic violence and sex. I feel this movie was made more for the filmaker's entertainment than the audience. It could have ended (and really should have) twenty minutes sooner. Even though it was about 90 minutes, it felt so much longer to me. The ending was a mess but at that stage I was just happy it was over."
11,Opens really well and sets the scene well. Then rapidly descends into a poor gorefest that has no actual story. The performances are good but there is no empathy felt for the main character. Visually it's ok but nothing special. Too many buts for me. Meh
12,"With its good performances, excellent visual design, and all the blood and gore you could ask for, Brandon Cronenberg's 'Possessor' is a thrilling, engaging experience that succeeds in getting under your skin."
13,"I think this is one of those films you will love or hate.It is quite slow moving and you do have to pay attention to get the most from it. Personally, I enjoyed it, and it makes a change from the usual sci-fi 'factory' movies churned out by Hollywood.The acting, writing, and production are superb."
14,"Look, I'm not some prestigious movie reviewer for any magazine or website that claims to be the end all be all of cinematic opinions. All I can say is that I've seen a lot of movies and I can tell the difference between a good one and a bad one. This movie is a bad one.I might as well start with the good things this movie was able to accomplish, as there are a few. The special effects were awesome, truly something to marvel as everything felt pretty real and accurate when it comes to gore. It was visually striking and was shot pretty well. The acting was pretty decent as well for the most part. Christopher Abbott is a very skilled actor and is shows in this movie, I would argue he was the saving grace since the rest of the cast was nothing to write home about.The rest of the movie can only be described as murder porn mixed with actual porn lightly topped with a plot that remained largely unexplored. The sex scene make up probably about a third of this movie and is purely tasteless and leads to absolutely nothing. Usually sex scenes lead to character building or progression of the plot, which is not the case for this movie as it seems they're only present to please the director and a few creeps that watched this alone in the theatre. There are a few scenes in this movie that are just literal porn. I cannot stress this enough, its just porn.There's also a ton of unnecessary gore scenes that only serve to shock people into reaction because the writing failed to do so on its own. The main character appears to not enjoy killing people in this movie (which makes sense and can lead to a thicker and richer plot) yet for some reason always chooses the most traumatic and barbaric ways to kill people. It makes no sense and is never explained. She has PTSD and hates killing people, she also has a gun to kill people quickly... lets just have her kill him with a fireplace poker in the most gruesome Evil Dead way possible. This movie is not Evil Dead, it wants to take itself so seriously and yet it seems as though the director reached peak creative maturity in middle school and wrote the movie strictly for those who carry the same mentality. The ending was pure confusion and its clear the director had no clue how to end his own movie.This movie has great scores across the board. I truly for the life of me cannot understand why. Its clear that movies have had a strict decline in quality over the past few years, yet movies like these still get great reviews. Its like solid writing and interesting, well explored plots has been replaced with relentless confusion and overly ridiculous concepts yet somehow people are receptive of this. Movies are dying and were just letting it happen."
15,"Every scene is just vacant looks, sadness, and anger... No likeable characters... No reason to care about anyone... No art... No film..."
16,Great acting . excellent concept. good plot twists. very enjoyable psycho scifi thriller. a real mimd twister
17,"Visually good, in some places great.There's about 5 mins of plot here and also about 5 mins that are worth watching.As a huge fan of David, I had huge expectations for his son, despite his rather mediocre first movie. Unfortunately this is pretentious garbage, that has long since become tired.If like me, 2 hours of your life is precious, and you get little time to watch movies - don't waste your Saturday night like I did watching this crap.I would have scored it lower but some of the visuals are extremely impressive."
18,I think the people giving this movie a bad review are totally out to lunch. I thought this flick was great for what it is. It's Beautifully shot. It's quite refreshing With the gore and great effects I really had no complaints other than the ending felt a little like there should've been more. But maybe it's open for a sequel. I'm quite excited for cronenbergs future projects.
19,"I have no idea how this has gotten so high of a rating and such rave reviews. It took me 3 attempts to get through this entire movie as I fell asleep twice in the first 30 minutes on 2 different occasions. The cinematography was very good and the acting was decent, but that is about the only positives I saw.The plotline has so many holes in it and many unanswered questions. They never explain how they implant the chip in the subjects scalp and we are left guessing on how it even works. Just found it very boring and incomplete."
20,"Immensely disturbing, shocking and provocative; ""Possessor"" takes you on a wild ride while playing with your mind.In this science-fiction horror film, an agent working for a secretive organization uses brain-implant technology to inhabit other people's bodies, driving them to commit assassinations for high-paying clients.It goes without saying that Cronenberg is heavily influenced by the earlier films his father made but I also couldn't help but think of John Frankenheimer's ""Seconds""while watching this. You can see where Cronenberg wants to play with sci-fi, horror and even reality. It's a daring vision and one you won't soon forget (if you have the stomach for it). Christopher Abbott is haunting in the lead role and Andrea Riseborough delivers a solidly chilling performance. It's a scary-ass film and I'm telling you there are visuals in ""Possessor"" that will haunt you for days, but I recommend you see it.Follow @snobmedia for all reviews!"
21,"*Spoilers*There was no real plot, except for the fact that the main character seemed to be losing touch with herself in the hosts body. Cut to the next scene and shes stabbing a person violently instead of just shooting them like a normal assassin would do. I was waiting for something to happen, but instead got a weird montage with the host wearing her face as a mask around town."
22,"I have to give it a one, because the main character doesn't allow you to feel anything for her. In the end you don't care what happens to her. This movie has no heart or passion, were you don't feel anything for anyone of the main characters. If you don't care about anyone, whats the point. No meaning or anything. Totally pointless. I like Brandon Cronenberg, he did a pretty good job with Antiviral, but I feel Possessor was simple hollow."
23,"While the overall artistry of the film was something interesting to see, like a disturbing Billie Eilish music video, the character development lacked any real substance of any true emotional human incarnation. There was nothing keeping us invested in the storyline, that we awkwardly had to leave in the middle of the movie."
24,Amazed to see the positive reviews of this movie .It is completely boring and the vocals from the characters can not be understood clearly .It falls flat on its arse .
25,"What a letdown. The movie isn't terrible, but it's not great either. Not remotely memorable.Could have been sooo much better. Great concept, poor execution."
26,I love this slow burn of a movie! The effects are awesome and very 80s like! It's such an interesting idea!
27,"Wow. Brandon Cronenberg has done it. After his debut film, Antiviral - an admirable, but not quite accomplished attempt at picking up where his father David left off - he has created a fully realized and fully original vision in POSSESSOR. Not only do the concepts and aesthetics meet Cronenberg standards, but the levels of brutalism and discomfort are SHOCKING - this might be more brutal than ANY movie that David Cronenberg ever made, yet it feels like it's made in a completely inspired manner and with genuine purpose.I started watching this movie at home late one night, and found it fully intriguing, and even kept thinking to myself ""whoa - this would be a great movie to see in the theater"", but got sleepy about halfway through and decided to call it a night. The next day I realized it was playing at theaters nearby and decided to head to the theater to get the full experience! And holy cowgirl am I glad I did! The first half was five times as enjoyable the second time, in the theater, and the second half blew my mind - I was definitely shouting multiple things out, squealing aloud in the theater - but I did have the whole room to my self. I've gotta say, I believe it is my favorite film of 2020 thus far, but I know that will not be the case for everyone - however, psych-horror is my absolute favorite sub-genre of film, and David Cronenberg is one of my favorite filmmakers of all time.Each passing segment sets up a new concept of intrigue, each a bit harder to swallow than the last. The film is actually quite a heavy experience to watch - not only does it make you think, but as you start figuring out what's going on, your brain will make you feel like you don't WANT to see what's going to happen next - so it's mostly a wholly discomforting, or ""challenging"" viewing - I felt genuinely terrified more than once. It's really impressive. And everything is tied up with a really bleak, disgusting little blood-bow in the end. The vile nature of humanity on full display (if you can comprehend what you just watched - it is clear through some reviews I've read that not everyone understands it).Visually, it's very locked in. There are near-future sci-fi set pieces & props, segments of hallucinogenic hacked-up surrealism, and as I mentioned, some of the most gut-wrenching violence I have seen in a movie in quite some time. It's not for the weak of heart - absolutely not.The whole cast annihilates. Sean Bean was fantastic in his role. Tuppence Middleton was perfect (what a name she has). Christopher Abbott was frighteningly discomforting. Jennifer Jason Leigh is always a pleasure. AND, of course, the new RABBIT'S FOOT of psych-horror, ANDREA RISEBOROUGH, the new queen, apparently has what it takes to bring all new visionary directors from their iffy debuts to making their first masterpieces with their sophomore efforts. First, she did it for Panos Cosmatos with MANDY, and now, she's done it again for Brandon Cronenberg. She is good luck, she is a force of nature, and this movie is a masterpiece."
28,"Here's the perfect film to put on if you're having trouble sleeping. Just press play on this, snuggle down and be bored to sleep in minutes, if death doesn't occur first."
29,"And hour and a half with no point, nothing explained.
watch at your own unresolved risk."
30,"Like father, like son.I haven't felt a sense of dread in a film, such as this one, in some time. I knew what I was getting into when I found out it was son of David Cronenberg, but somehow still caught me a bit off guard.
The uncut is a sci-fi/horror, beautifully crafted tour-de-force of complexity, graphic violence and gore that will test your will and perhaps bend the mind enough to actually get, not only the premise, but at the end of the final act, you feel somewhat rattled and an odd sense of the films relevance, not unlike his fathers filmography.Niche genre, much aligned with Alex Garland in concept, and his fathers stylistic vision and fingerprints are on it, but this is Brandon's baby, and what a baby he has conceived."
31,"Only good idea and nice to see few hot girls. But the story is unclear, complicated, and not finished. Just give us some insight into some weird dimension and possibilities. Not good to watch. Sexual, boring, complicated, amateur. Only that doctor or psychologist acted professionally and reminds me of real world psychologists and psychiatrists, because of small confident manners during interrogation."
32,"Finally movie where from first seconds you can feel that creators of movie cared about final result. Actors, sets,fx and even script was well made.Ussualy nowadays everyone just make movies to suit everyone (to make more money) , and filmmakers are scared to put blood or nude scenes etc just cheap sell out films... But this kind of movies is not for every one but for those who enyoy good cinema.Ps There is movies with millions of budget but who looks and feels like cheap fast food. So if we compare this film to food than this is some delicatessen, what I was missing lately.Thanks for good film."
33,"Do you know when you watch the first 15 minutes of a movie and know it's going to be bad, this is one of those films.Movie is slow and boring, unnecessary nude scenes, unnecessary violence, and many items are just filler scenes with no purpose.2020 is full of bad movies and this is one of them."
34,"The movie is very boring and slow for the first 60minutes... then it becomes a rampant gore-fest for about 10minutes and then it returns to being exceptionally boring plus it gets confusing and just down-right strange until the end.There are CONSTANT flash-backs (or flash forwards?) which confuse the viewer and seemingly don't add anything to the overall plot or story... the whole movie just feels scatterbrained and crazy for crazy's sake alone... the movie's poster very aptly sums up the entire movie, and that is: ""WTF?""... you've got no idea what the poster is supposed to symbolize, and the movie feels the same... after the 100minutes that the movie lasted, I just felt confused and befuddled... I wasn't entertained, or laughing or enthralled... I was simply confused."
35,Dont know what I expected.. But it's not a very good movie. Boring and not much horror about this.
36,"Geez... I wonder what they had thought before they decided to make this ""beautiful"" movie? And for the actors and actresses, I hope this movie won't end their careers. Better luck next time guys"
37,"Too many plot holes, so many unanswered questions. Should've waited to see on Netflix."
38,"My God, this movie is tediuosly slow. And not in a good way.Seventeen minutes into it I was screaming for something to happen. Yeah, the first scene was interesting but then it goes down hillI can't fault the acting. But the writing and directing leave so much to be desired.I get the feeling people whi give this flick good reviews are huge Father Cronenberg fans. They need to jusge this on its own. And it's not that good."
39,"Five minutes of Sci Fi,five minutes of horror,the rest pure boredom,no need for more of a review than that."
40,"It is almost as if, with the advent of streaming media, the critics are desperate for an actual feature to gush over. They picked the wrong movie. There are clever bits here and there, but the directors endless love affair with the tropes of low-budget film making, static scenes, dim lighting -- all these will ultimately disappoint. And the gushers would do well to remember that the director's father may have started with low-budget productions but eventually graduated to blockbusters like A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE. We can only hope."
41,"Based on an interesting premise, but quite pointless and failed to engage this particular viewer partly due to lack of character development. I didn't care about the protagonist, whatsoever, so the lackluster story remains - a lackluster story."
42,"Do you remember that weird kid you went to high school with? You know, the one we all worried would be the next school shooter? Now imagine a world where that guy was given a magic wand to turn his violent, bloodlust fantasies into a film. And then he named that film Possessor. Now we're on the same page.'Gratuitous' doesn't begin to describe the violence and gore in this movie. There are a few stretches of plot development to be found between murder scenes, but that's not what this film is about. If you like splatter gore, you'll probably love this film. If not, watch something else, or else you'll find yourself typing out a snarky review on IMDb the next morning, wishing you could un-see it all."
43,"I hate watching films with expectations because they will undoubtedly influence perception/opinion. I admit I did go into this film with some hope that perhaps the young Cronenberg could live up to the family name in terms of cinematic experience to some degree. I at least hoped that it would be a reasonably good film, my expectations were definitely not all that high. I saw some good reviews, but didn't read them and just went to check it out with an open mind and a little hope. My hopes were unfounded as the film really is nothing to be excited about. In fact, I found the film to be profoundly boring. The story isn't bad really, it's somewhat interesting, but it's delivered in slow motion and with a lot of misplaced weirdness. This coming from a lover of weird films. Luis Buñuel, David Lynch and Federico Fellini are among my favorite all time filmmakers for instance. I've never been a fan of weirdness just for the sake of being weird however. Weirdness needs to be interesting, compelling to at least some degree, not completely pointless. This film seems to focus too much on its weirdness and less on the interesting aspects of the story, and to me, none of the weirdness was of any interest. Brandon may indeed one day be a director worth watching, however today is not the day. To me this film was not even in the same league as Father David's first feature Shivers. That film isn't great either, but even it kicks the crap out of this pile of boring.5/10"
44,Probably not the worst film I've ever seen but it's up there. Pure twaddle
45,Just one more pointless movie that tries to put meaning in something that has none
46,Don't waste your time on this one. There is absolutely nothing going on and you will fall asleep while watching.
47,"I really anticipated this movie but I was let down after watching it. 5 stars for the acting. That's it.Everybody hyped it as the next big thing in body horror but Possessor is just a shadow of David Cronenberg's body horror. His son did a bad job here. A few bloody murders here and there but FAR from body horror. I'm not gonna mention other movies in this review but there are MANY far better modern indie body horror movies out there if you're really looking for them.Who was the evil step son? We don't even see him in the movie except that image of him.Why did they try to pull Tasya out even though she didn't even kill the CEO?Why did Colin/Tasya visit the injured CEO afterwards in that quick scene?Why does Tasya hate her family to the point of telling Colin to kill them when at the beginning we see her loving them and wanting to spend more time with them? She loses her guilt at the end but why? Does she want to be the best possessor? If so, why? What happened to her early in her life that later she so passionately wants to be the best possessor/assassin? Child trauma? We'll never know.Many plot holes, very little body horror.Sad to say it, but I actually don't recommend Possessor."
48,"The premise of this movies is that through (needlessly gory) operation of some sort, one person is able to control another person. I say needlessly gory because that sort of operation in truth would need to be done by a skilled brain surgeon. Instead, it looks like it was performed by an amateur handiman. Thus, although it's gory, it is completely unbelievable.Character development is almost completely lacking. There's a bit of information exchange when preparing to target the next victim. Apparently, although the possessor can target a victim and control them, they nevertheless have no access to their life experiences, etc. - until, contradictorily, later in the film, when they are mixed together.There's an odd scene that I still haven't figured out where the possessor, occupying the body of a victim goes to his job site. What in the world is his job? Apparently, it's identifying curtains, blinds, etc., while trying to ignore pornographic scenes. There's no rhyme or reason to the scene - just gratuitous pornography.I mostly agree with the longer review by Rendanlovell. The movie had a lot of potential, but I give it a D for execution. It should be redone from scratch."
49,"Save your precious time, this movie is just BAD BAD BAD."
50,Quite possibly the worst film I have seen in a long while.Story is all over the place. Actors seem bored. It wants to be a cult film but fails on every level.
51,"While I must admit, it is visually stunning, most of the beauty is taken away when the flashing lights are constantly hindering the audiences view.
The movie is very bland and the characters are unlikeable.
Unfortunately I was forced to see this movie with my family and young siblings. The sex scenes are as visual as pornography. You might as well have searched up pornography and connected It to the movie screen. Female genitalia and male genitalia is fully exposed. This is the first theatrical film I've ever scene that has done this. Arguably worse than Fifty Shades of Grey 1, 2, and 3. Nothing memorable about this movie other than that and the African American actresses acting in the first quarter. She was outstanding versus everyone else.
The absolute most forgettable film of the year. Thank you for nothing."
52,"Well, Dad said to his son: Go directing a movie. The last one was horrible, let´s try again. I´ll show you all : Put a lot of blood, a confused script, some fingers cutted, a child assassination, some nudity and that´s all... Put all of this in the liquidificator and voilá, you are gonna be a sucessfull director ! I have to tell ou: The script gone wrong, ok ? Tsc, tsc, tsc... don´t waste your time...I lost mine...."
53,"Oi, this is just a stinking mess of a movie, bad acting, 2 dollar budget and a fragmented story. I gave up after 30Very much like a Ewe Boll movie"
54,"I thought this might be a new version of Scanners by David Cronenberg but his son Brandon Cronenberg, did him no justice. This movie just stinks. He had a good concept, from his father's original movie, but in his attempt to improve the story he somehow made it more stupid and boring with less gore. He decided to go Boring artsy fartsy nonsense, rather than an homage to the original Scanners. What a waste of film and time."

My average - 6,75It's a quit interesting idea, but what are the motivations of the characters. It's missing the point or someone should explain it to me. This movie felt like long sit, so that I couldn't keep up with my mind."
56,"'Possessor' is quite unique.It's a 20 minute short that feels like it's played on 0.25 speed.Getting over all the artsy imagery and cinematography is the easiest part since it is mostly hereditary. Some of it is well-thought, some is there just for style points.The film is well-acted, the score is great, and although it feels low-budget, this never hurts the film.Yet enjoying the story is almost impossible. I can buy some sort of alternate universe with such technology, even though this doesn't make sense in most of the cases they use it for. But having no characters and very limited dialogue that feels like copywritten descriptions of human interactions...I'm not sure I'm up for that.Maybe it was intentional but besides the fact that that our main lead is slowly losing her human qualities only saving the bloodlust is not enough for me to care.It really feels like nothing besides ""you know what would've looked cool"" shots and basic allegories are in this film.I mean, I think this was intentional and the film is just the way they wanted it to be, but again, it's just not interesting or engaging.Top it all up with lots of scenes where everyone moves like they are submerged into water and here you go - a very basic idea, hidden behind so much stuff that goes nowhere it just feels like you're wasting your time expecting something interesting."
57,"The atmosphere, conflict of characters affecting the protagonists' decisions, score, everything just falls into place. The stunning camera visuals do justice in giving a glimpse into the mind of the characters and also manages to bring about visualization of hysteria. The imagery is strong with this movie. The character transitions are hazy but they add more to the movie than take away from it.And don't let the movie poster deter you from watching it. It is a brilliantly executed concept which hopefully will receive more recognition with time"
58,"No Spoilers! How we can we reconcile extreme violence with good filmmaking in this film? It was just terrible. Sean Bean's career will die if he keeps picking the angry, controlling cardboard characters of late.Acting given the bad script was decent. Okay one more time.. Disgusting and terrible."
59,"Disregard low rating under 6.
i feel its a good 7.
yes its a bit slow but not too slow. I personally felt a bit let down in the last scene or two, but personal opinions.....
This movie is surprisingly well thought and have some gores and weird moments. it is not boring.
i would b very please if i be daddy Cronenberg wt this one.
I was expecting a snore fest and this is not.
Its also not a high octane popcorn Hollywood commercial thing.
Watch it!
I like to recommend you check out 2020 The midnight gospel animation series ,also movie Ravenous 1999 and Jacob's ladder 1991"
60,"Original twist on the murder-by-proxy narrative that suffers from an under-developed backstory and excessive usage of dream-reality scenes. The open-ended storytelling adds to the confusion and will frustrate some. Although the director did a very good job at getting the best out of his actors, who all performed superbly, the movie as a whole is unsuccessfull in keeping the viewer convinced and interested."
61,"What the hell was that? I kept trying to make sense of this strange movie thinking it would all come together at some point. WRONG! It just got worse and crazier making no sense at all right up to the ending, which made even less sense. ""Ishtar"" and ""Post Man"" used to be my references to a terrible movie but we have a new winner by leaps and bounds. I love Jennifer Jason Leigh, thankfully she was only a secondary character. What a piece of garbage this turned out to be. I feel like I need a shower after this crappy flick. Yuck!"
62,"I was looking forward to this, but it just came across as quite boring. Not a lot happens and there's quite a lot of meandering. Andrea Riseborough is always fantastic & Sean Bean doesn't die for a change. That was nice, I suppose."
63,"What do you get when you take the theme of some fun Schwarzenegger sci-fi flic from the 80's and turn it into an arthouse movie with lots of slow camera movements, minimalistic design and hallucinogenic caleidoscopic shots? You don't get much further than a 6,5 on IMDB appearantly. When watching Total Recall you at least know in advance you don't have to expect more than it's shallow premise."
64,"A hybrid sci-fi and body-horror. «Possesor» is an interesting movie to watch, but there's something missing, a clarity of focus and intent. «Possesor» is humorless, from start to finish. Its energy is ponderous and glum, and the provocative ideas are not given a chance to really take on a life of their own. The film starts strong, pulling you into its mystery and strangeness."
65,"It's something in conspiracy theory/real fact that someone can be taken over by suggestion/hypnotism and ""activated"". This somewhat builds on this and builds a film around it. Doesn't really work and seems over half the film is ""the one that goes wrong"" - without really showing you how it should have been done"
66,"The same thing always happens. A movie gets hyped, I buy in and get excited, then watch it and am mildly interested in it and wonder what all the fervor was all about. It happened all over again with Possessor (or Possessor Uncut), which is not the alternate title to Horror Express (©Bill Van Ryn for that joke) and it's not one of the movies within a movie within Popcorn.The film starts interesting enough, as we watch a woman (Gabrielle Graham) insert a needle inside her head and attach it to a machine. She then goes to work at a party where she repeatedly stabs a man, then nearly turns a gun on herself before the police shot her. It turns out that she's controlled by a possessor named Tasya Vos (Andrea Riseborough), which means that she can directly implant her mind into someone else and use them to kill people.As her boss (Jennifer Jason Leigh, always a welcome actress) talks her through the end of the assignment, Tasya must identify objects from her past to prove that she is still herself. That's another lie, as she can barely speak like a normal human being when she meets her ex-husband (Rossif Sutherland) and son.But there's no time to consider that. There's another job, as they have been hired to kill the owner of a data mining company, which excites everyone because they'll be able to control the company by blackmailing the man who hired them. They use the owner's daughter Ava's boyfriend Colin (Christopher Abbott) for the hit, but for the first time, the company doesn't have all of the answers. And even after he completes half the job, killing his girlfriend - yet only wounding her father - he takes back over and causes Tasya to vomit blood.Can Tasya complete her assignment and get her mark to kill himself so she can be released? Or is this her final possession? And how does her son get involved?The main reason most have discussed this film is because it was written and directed by Brandon Cronenberg, the son of, well, you know. This definitely has style, the colors and camera angles are gorgeous but there's an icy edge that ill serves the movie to me. It's as if we are as much on the outside looking in as the titular possessor. I wanted to feel more, to get really excited about it and to find a new favorite, but it was just good.And I learned, yet again, that hype can really sell a movie, but once it's playing in front of your eyes, it's your call whether or not you really enjoy it. But hey - your experience may vary and you might completely adore this. Also, knowing me, once Brandon Cronenberg's second movie is hated by everyone else - see this same story played out in Under the Silver Lake and Southland Tales - I'll fall in love with one of his movies.That said - it has a psychic possession threeway, so there's that. And oh yeah - of course he points to Argento as an influence, which makes sense, as this film is awash in dream imagery and primary colors. There's also female as male as female - or whatever the possessor is - full frontal nudity, if you're looking to get your mind blown.There are some great ideas and images here, so I'll definitely keep an eye on what comes next."
67,"The incipit is really good: an agency that perform contract killings, use a very innovative technology that implants a device on the brain of a designated target that allows to the killer to remotely wire. Therefore the person is replaced, his free will is canceled and the killer is then able to complete the assignment, without being directly involved. The concept is really good, but the movie has a lot of issues.The movie has an ethereal kind of narration, which is a good choice, considering the main theme, but the pace is too slow. The director, which is also the main screenwriter, wanted to experiment, by creating strange effects and applying weird sound design and music, which I personally appreciated, but the story is not going on. There are a lot of stuff that are not explained: we never know what this agency is, why it exists, is it some kind of secret government project? Who are these agents? Why they are doing what they are doing? Do they receive a special training? Because none of this is clarified, I did not care about the context nor characters, I could not bound with them. The main character, Tasya Vos, played by Andrea Riseborough, has clearly some personal issue with the ex fiancée, or maybe husband, I don't get to know, but why her relationship is broken? What happened? Is it because of her job? You see how many questions I am writing in this review? There tons of plot holes.After an interesting and involving intro, the screenplay starts to crumble. I have understood that the director wanted to keep a mistery-vibe, but you cannot keep your audience completely blind for the entire movie. There was a lot of potential, but it was wasted, because the director decided to play too much with visual effects, instead on focusing more on the story."
68,Note: Your average casual movie watching coupleThe story is truly one of kind and is told in a unique way thanks to the director. Thought this plot had so much cool potential but just didn't perform. The issue is there was a lack of any buy in on wanting to get into or deeply understand the characters and it felt more so as a gore fest with strung out scenes and not the most captivating plot advancement.All in all worth a watch if you want something out there and your cool with gore. I would not recommend this to a friend.
69,"I had a really bad day and potentially this could be the worst possible movie to pick to end it with.It wasn't. I was mesmerized. No Hollywoodian BS, no over the top nonsense.Arty and intriguing. In a certain undefinable way, it reminded me of Only Lovers Left Alive (don't know why, hence the ""undefinable"", is that even a word?).For those snorefesters out there, pardon my French, but you wouldn't know a work of art if it was shoved up your butthole and timely announced before by e-mail, FB-post and Whatsapp. ""Ted and Bill face the music"" might be more up your alley. By all means.But this here one intrigued me and got me drawn in. I still have to get my head around it. I love movies like these. Not being snobby, just happy to find something that tickles my fancy and makes me think. Which, in my case, happens like once a decade. The thinking bit.Cheers, people. It's a dark year. But there will be light again."
70,Warning... you must have the brain power to pay attention for 90 minutes. if you don't or if you have a below average IQ this movie won't be for you7.2
71,"Rank system i use is it can only be ONE movie that is the best and then get 10, to get a 9 it have to be something extraordinarily like Alien and so, a 5 is a ok movie nothing more nothing less its simple a mainstream movie.Like the idea but this is a psyko twisting long slow going movie that never come to its point it simple ends with no question answered or even a ending."
72,"A portrait of the present: Big corporations and companies tear families apart and turn humans into beasts. Stunning visual essay, perhaps too violent - but in this case it serves the purpose."
73,"If someone gives this 9, or even 5 you know they are paid to give favorable reviews or have a stake in the movie somehow. This was just terrible.For the guy who liked the effects cus they were like 80's, what, they were terrible lol... He definitely must have something to gain if he thinks 80's slasher effects were good lol... uh, no they were not lol...Look, this is just pathetic... but, if you want or need a reason to drive you out of your house and into the back yard for some fresh air than by all means, put this on lol....This is the perfect example of why you should read all the reviews.... and not the paid moron's or ones that give out 9 stars like candy lol...."
74,Never seen something like that. A quite singular work. So gory and violent but with a nice plot.
75,"An incomplete tale with too much sexual crap, not enough plot.I suppose some people are really easily blindsided by things like this, but not me. I demand more from a screenplay, I want to actually know what the heck is going on.This movie plays like 'Inception' mashed with 'The Cell', except more cryptic with more artsy imagery that serves no purpose for plot or storytelling.4/10 save yourself some money and grief and don't expect anything out of this one."
76,"While the movie was a bit slow and lacked character development, the visceral, shocking, psychological mind-bending scenes were engaging and entertaining.The concept of the movie was nothing new, but the stylish, intelligent story was enough to draw me in!Recommend 6/10"
77,The fact that I didn't turn this movie off mid-view says more about my stubbornness than the virtue of this dud. I just kept thinking something of value would appear. Yet it did not. Save yourself the agony. Go watch paint dry. It's just bad. It doesn't work on any level and everyone left in the room I was watching with yelled 'that better not be the credits rolling' or something to that effect when the end mercifully arrived. As in 'you feel cheated' that you watched it and the shock of how bad the movie is sinks in when it's finally over. Go elsewhere.
78,"The story itself is pretty basic with a few very neat ideas of future technology and how it can be warped to serve a commercial moralistically challenging idealThe violence is very violent, sometimes almost seemingly for the sake of grossing people outThe acting is solid and enjoyableI understand the ending, I don't feel there is any ambiguity about it. Effectively it's the story of one person losing whatever humanity she has left and becoming an emotionless void to be controlled and manipulatedCertainly leaves a mark"
79,"Not going too much into detail, but this movie certainly borrows heavily from the 1995 Ghost In The Shell anime by Mamoru Oshii. Hacker(s) taking control of other people. False or implanted memories.
For me personally it was a bit too obvious where they got their inspiration to experience the movie as original or very good.I am not going to pretend like there aren't at least a dozen other films who do or try to do the same, but when you also take into account that the music at times (the modernized/distorted female high pitched choire) is a direct ripoff of Kenji Kawai's Ghost In The Shell original score, then the picture is complete.Luckily the movie tries to bring in it's own ideas, especially on a psychological level. At times it's a very unpleasant, dark and gruesome watch. Especially the violence can get to stomach-turning levels.
Personally I appreciated the dark and raw style, we need more unapologetic movies like this.All in all not a bad movie, just a shame it's so obvious to see where they got some of the main ideas for the plot."
80,"Holy crap i thought it was an interesting movie. It was really witty and it might not be for everyone. The mood is rather blunt and there isn't a lot of suspense it just happens which kinda makes things a little to gruesome. As i was watching the movie i keep thinking to myself if this is something i would watch again and if this is something i would want to purchase to show others. As for me wanting to watch it again i kinda feel like I wouldn't mind, of course a year from now or so. They had quite a few original ideas and a lot of the cinematography was very abstract art like how we would find it in the MOCA Museum though it was just a little bit more normal to the point where you can kinda connect the dots to gather what was happening. The storyline took a while to get but once you got it a third of the movie in you kinda wonder the possibilities of the movie, i would have liked a little more pazzaz, action, but it felt ok nothing amazing. As for if I would buy this and show to others, i would probably want to buy it once it becomes cheap, this does feel like the kind of movie that isn't really a big title. The company behind the movie I haven't really heard of, its a Canadian company so that probably does help. If there movies are like this i can say they surly have a different taste for what they consider scary to be. I wouldn't mind showing this to other people but it isn't on the top of the list and doesn't really show anything amazing with picture, maybe sound in some parts of the movie but again nothing really stands out. The reason why i like the movie is the ideas behind it and how the movie feels like a soft indie short film but with some good directors and again storytelling the movie i enjoyed. I'd give it an overall ranting of 7/10 i did notice 3 people of 2 groups did leave before the movie ended so i can see how some might have felt it was too boring, to gross, or not interesting enough, so your kinda split between liking it or not. I wouldn't go as far as saying i loved it. This has been my soft review of Possessor."
81,"""Possessor"" is one of those movies that is more ""interesting"" than ""good"". In that way, it reminded me of ""Under the Skin"". The ideas thrown up on screen are interesting, the imagery is surprising, as is the score, and the violence is heavier than you expect.It's pretty strong stuff, but it doesn't have a gripping story underpinning the bizarreness we're watching. As such it didn't really grab me.It's hard not to compare this work by Brandon Cronenberg to that of his father, the legendary David Cronenberg. Consider ""Videodrome"", for example. That was, if anything, more out-there than this, and yet it worked better, due to James Woods' performance, and a stronger narrative presence. Here, the stand-out is Christopher Abbott, but his performance is occluded by too many other actors. The woman who invades his head is not strongly established enough."
82,"This film is derivative of films like Inception, Momento, and Scanners. It was trying hard to feel dystopian, but missed the mark creating a less than suitable atmosphere to compliment the narrative. That would have been forgivable had the ending not fallen apart and left the viewer wishing it had a linear sense of logic. Additional plot narrative absolutely needed to added. It's too bad the writer opted against doing so. So close, yet so far.The cast was excellent. A mixture of veterans, Sean Bean and Jennifer Jason Leigh, and up and coming talent specifically Christopher Abbott, who was awesome in 2019's 'Catch-22'.It seems there is a touch of community nepotism from critics, actors, and even movie goers. The exceptional cast would not have been possible in my opinion, had the writer/director not been David Cronenberg's son. That's not to say Brandon Cronenberg doesn't have talent, for example, 'Antiviral' was very good. But I think he should step out from the shadow of his father, before his films become mediocre."
83,"There's no doubt that daddy would be proud.Seven years on from his impressive debut with cult horror Antiviral, son of David, Brandon Cronenberg returns with another horror filled sci-fi Possessor, a grisly, bloody and original offering that feels as though its been born straight out of the 80's genre cannon too hit us hard with its unflinching violence and examination of a tech-filled world gone bad.With its bleak aesthetic and even bleaker narrative that focuses on Andrea Riseborough's mentally withering Tasya, whose job is working for a shady organization using advanced technology to ""possess"" human hosts and carry out assassinations for high paying clients, Possessor is a typically Cronenberg experience that isn't one you'd call enjoyable in the essence of the saying but its a constantly engaging one that pulls no punches as we go down a dangerous rabbit hole with Tasya.Promoted heavily as Possessor Uncut in many markets, there's a reason the marketing behind Cronenberg's film has honed in on this aspect of the film as much like his father before him Brandon is able to shock and surprise viewers with Possessor's often unexpected bursts of wince-inducing violence and terror, that while not frequent in the film, make themselves well and truly known when they arrive.The films more notable arrivals that include these blood splattered moments and some fairly confronting examples of on screen nudity go a large way to enlivening an otherwise fairly subdued and somber offering with Possessor in no real rush or worry when it comes to getting things done fast or developing characters further than a surface level but thanks to the work of the always good Riseborough and another solid turn from rising star Christopher Abbott, Possessor feels a cut above similar low-budget affairs that don't often feel as polished or refined as this.There's not many elements of Cronenberg's film that haven't been explored in some way, shape or form in other films and more likable characters wouldn't of hurt the films chances of being slightly more memorable but there's enough here to once more suggest that the youngest Cronenberg can live up to his father's significant reputation as a boundary pushing director.Final Say -A grim and brutal affair that is the very definition of sci-fi/horror, Possessor is a another solid piece of work from Brandon Cronenberg that hints at the possible greatness that is to come from the up and coming director.3 1/2 cocktail parties out of 5"
84,"Film was decent, not enough for me, and do people realize stabbings in real life are this brutal? Too much blood? More like the perfect amount and pretty realistic... That was not over the top. It was realistic violence. Movie wasn't scary at all but a good film for 2020. If I had saw this film in my local AMC theater, my experience would've probably been amazing and my rating would be higher."
85,"The scariest part was Ava having a deformed mask of herself and caressing her son and having sex with her husband etc.
Thanks to a system, they can intrude and possess a persons mind with a chip in the brain and make him/her kill people so that they can benefit. Ava Vos possessed a guy who's dating a rich man daughter and that rich man own a data mining company. She was supposed to kill him and his daughter and they'll own the company. He possessed the body and at a reception at the fathers house, he killed him vileontly and shot his daughter but to take herself out she has to shoot hereelf in the head too but she can't do that no matter what. And then she lost control of his brain and his coworker from the company who was also a plant and a colloborator shot him in the head and recalibrated him but as she was dreaming herself with a deformed mask of herself she shot him like she shot the girl who's the owner of the house she took refuge and a fried of his girlfriend. Then he ended up in his own husbands home and killed him too and her son slit his throat and she shot him multiple times including in the head and he said ""take me out!"" And then she woke up with a stranger woman from the device. Her family wasn't her family after all and was that why she was violent towards her husband? The ending was confusing and the bug of the system could have been something else than I can't take myself out. But still it was pretty fun to watch with all those gore scenes and good acting including the guy looking exactly like John Snow"
86,"It is weird, gory and yet very boring. I just don't understand what is going on."
87,"Some of my favorite movies are the ones that hit me so hard i can't even stand after it's over. i'm just stuck sitting there trying to pull myself out of this world i've been living in for the past couple hours. this film is so unsettling in the best way possible. the violence was extremely gory but also felt somewhat tame in a way, i couldn't sit still. i was filled with so much anxiety and unable to fathom how our main character is going to come out of this.
the cinematography, sound mixing, and editing were superb. every detail felt purposeful. i felt like i was part of this bad trip. i was the possessed unable to control the chaos around me.
for only being in the first few minutes gabrielle graham left a huge impact on me. the emotional range she shows in the opening scene was outstanding. i hope to see more of her on my screen. andrea riseborough is such a chamaeleon. almost unrecognizable in every role i see her in. she just becomes the character and delivers truly believable performances. chris abbott truly stole the show for me though. i was reminded of his role in piercing. he does great at playing someone so subdued yet erratic. i literally can't stop thinking about it.
this movie has infected my brain and i can't stop thinking about it. i cannot wait to see it again"
88,Meh this was okay nothing special and slightly pretentious! The violence was a bit over the top and I like a violent film
89,The premise is great. Male lead lets the whole thing down for me. In general just a bit lacking / pointless. Not the worst movie I have ever watched
90,"Firstly I want to say I don't know how this film is getting bad reviews, it's synopsis and the director being the son of David should let you know what kind of a ride you're in for.
I personally thought it was great. From the acting to the script to the direction and score. There isn't really anything I can fault.
Is it something New and special? No
Is it better than some of the reviews are making out? Oh god yes!
I would and will recommend this to friends without a doubt. It was exactly as good as I was hoping it would be and I enjoyed every minute"
91,"I'm very glad I got to see the uncut version of 'Possessor'. I think almost every film performs better when we get to see what the director actually wanted to put on the screen, rather than what the rating system necessitates they include. The version I got to see was extremely violent and featured graphic nudity (relevant to the story). It made for a much better movie than what I assume the alternative is like.This movie has a fun concept. Going into someone else's body and then assassinating people - how could a movie go wrong with that right? And the movie doesn't really go wrong, but it did let me down that it kind of felt like it did the most expected thing with it. It went in a direction which I feel is what 99% of film-makers would have gone in. I was hoping the film would hit me with a twist or a hook at some point, but it never really came. I guess I just wanted a little more out of the story.The film does get a little confusing towards the end, but not enough to ruin the film for you hopefully. And it does clear itself up in the end. I had a good time with 'Possessor' but I didn't quite love it as much as I'd hoped to."
92,"I expected to be visually amazing, moved as a spectator from what we usually are accustomed to see if we just watch mainstream. I actually expected something in the lines of what David Cronenberg did when he started. Somewhere near Crimes from the Future and Stereo, with maybe a mix of eXistenZ. And of course the visuals from the trailer and the presence of Andrea Riseborough convoked the visually stunning Beyond the Black Rainbow from Panos Cosmatos (because she played in his subsequent movie Mandy). And I have to say, Brandon Cronenberg did not disappoint by delivering a great mix of just that, with that unique canadian feel. I was first amazed by the set where the first scenes take place, and then completely at home with the montage, effects and concept of the story. The long ""dive"" sequence surely again make me think of an updated version of the somewhat similar nightmarish dive in BTBR. Definitely something I'll enjoy rewatching. I would have loved for the story to dive deeper in this and have a broader spectrum, move forward with what was showed in the end, and have something even more creeper to offer, because it showed and explained so much that it could have built on it even further. But definitively a movie that will stick and that I'll be happy to give another go from time to time."
93,"I found this movie quite disturbing, just solely based on the nihilistic sense of meaningless killing found within. They never really explain why or how this secretive organization is killing people for hire. The lead character, the pale, blonde Brit, is some sort of sociopath who possesses people using technology, then makes them kill targets. However, the technology goes haywire, and she always has trouble escaping, which is usually done by suicide. So help is sent. Without giving too much away, the character development is sorely lacking. You only get brief snippets of the characters, but it always pulls away before going too far. The performances are all strong."
94,"This weird sci-fi thriller can only be described as Avatar like but with real people.
Tasya Vos (played by Andrea Riseborough) is an agent that works for a secret agency, that has the ability to overtake the mind of humans using a brain implant. You see Vos (as Tasya is known) in the body of a host, while inside the host's mind, she controls the brain and bodily functions of that person, allowing her to get close to the real objective of assassination. The first mission you see is a success and gets pulled out by the agency. She is then assessed by Girder (played by Jennifer Jason Leigh). Once Vos passes the evaluation, she is free to go back to her normal life.
The issues then begin to show, she starts having flashbacks/glitches. She asks the agency for another job, when really the problems she is having should be sorted, but she decides to keep these from them. We then see that next job play out, as she becomes the ""Possessor"" of Colin Tate (played by Christhopher Abbott)
I thought that it was a very slow starter but the action, violence and blood do come. I weirdly enjoyed the concept of the movie. I do like the first scene that Vos is in Colin's body, all i will say, in the bathroom, pj bottoms on, realising you (as a woman) are a man!"
95,"A son who wants to inherit his father's spirit meanwhile trying to hide his intention. The film ends up like one of the mediocre episode of black mirror, visually and narratively."
96,"If I were to count father and son as a single director, which is a spectacularly weird and cruel thing to do, I would say Possessor is top tier Cronenberg. It is incredible and mesmerising, and disturbing, and gory, and wince-inducing, and surprising on a visual level. They do things which I would not expect to work on screen, and yet it does, and I'm thinking specifically of the mask scene. Extremely highly recommended."
97,"This is a really solid flick. It would normally be near the bottom of my top 10 of any good movie year. Oh well. I was still happy to see it. It's very well made, pretty well acted , to the point, brutal and nihilistic, and surreal enough to handle the brutality. I thought the ending was perfect."
98,"Uncut Review. Where to start? Possessor will not be for everyone. Is that a bad thing? Not necessarily, but your enjoyment of this movie will vary significantly depending on your taste. Possessor is a slow movie and there is no explanation that is spoon fed to the audience once you hit the end credits. I will say I enjoyed Possessor's ingredients of disturbing visuals and graphic violence. The violence is not frequent but when it happens it is bloody and may make your jaw drop a few times. It reminded my of Nicolas Refn's Drive when the killings do happen in Possessor. Some of the dream-like sequences are truly disturbing and will make you say wtf out loud. As for the story I don't want to give to much away but it takes a few interesting turns and demands your attention. If you end up enjoying Possessor then another viewing will fill in some gaps. Possessor is slow, graphic and not for everyone but I found the story/premise interesting enough to hold my attention throughout. Honestly, Possessor is messed up and I appreciate Brandon Cronenberg sticking with his vision and giving the audience a truly disturbing experience. If you can stick with Possessor you may enjoy it, even love it. Pay attention in the beginning of the film when Vos is describing how she feels about killing the butterfly when she was little. Then listen closely to how she describes her experience with the butterfly at the end of the film. Love movies that get me thinking like this."
99,Stylised horror/sci-fi and extremely violent. Brandon Cronenberg follows well in his father's blueprint of cerebral/body horror.
100,A thought provoking concept combined with a slow burning story = A great film
101,"Son of Franken... er, Cronenberg!With his daddy's penchant for shadowy sets and copious blood flow, combined with a thought-provoking dystopian premise, Brandon Cronenberg keeps it all in the film family.""Possessor"" tracks a mysterious operative that knocks off no good corporate bigwigs in a most ingenious manner of hostile takeover. With an icky insertion of a control chip in the back of the head, an innocent can be controlled remotely by another, resulting in the perfect, untraceable, suicidal assassin.The possession is tricky though, not a complete one way transferral (the technology of course, isn't foolproof) and there is some glitchy twitches as body and mind vie for control. Interesting stuff. The host and possessor switcheroo gets saucy when female Tasya (Andrea Riseborough) inhabits male Colin, (Christopher Abbott) and tries to pull off all relationship nuances leading up to the job. Brings the ""who are you?"" relationship question to a new level, not to mention the artificial intelligence doom angle all SciFi flicks adhere to.But let's not forget that this is a Cronenberg film, and that means inspite of the cerebral lure, the squeamish need to stay the hell away. There is a bloody body count, and it is always a messy, slow and squishy affair. Artistic in a morbid manner if you will.Like father, like son: a dead ringer.hipCRANK"
102,"Watched it a few weeks ago. Doesn't stay with you for long. Some ""cool"" gore on display & decent cinematography, that's it. An anorexic ghost has surely possessed the lead actress when you contrast what's on display here versus how she looked absolutely gorgeous in ""Disconnect"" not that long ago. Anyway, the dialogue is barely audible (especially the scenes with Jennifer Jason Leigh) & its overall very pedestrian."
103,Everything your intuition is telling you is as real as your eyes seeing our intuition is our third eye which helps us to understand our own heart mind and soul...
104,"Many people have already posted reviews sharing what I thought about the movie.My biggest annoyance is that Tas is supposedly one of the best (if not the best). But when it comes time to pull out, she can't pull the trigger.If we assume that she has done many missions, shouldn't she be used to pulling the trigger? Later, we're shown she has what it seems to be cramping in her right fingers. After finishing her mission and when it comes time to pull the trigger, lo and behold... she can't pull the trigger again. No matter how she puts the gun in her mouth or to the side of her head, her right fingers can't do it.Guess what?! There's something called a left hand. I'm not a film analyst but, assuming she's not afraid of going home, her left hand is more than capable of pulling the trigger. But she doesn't even make a single attempt to hold the gun with the other hand...I agree a lot with what others say: there's a lot of ideas here BUT the execution (and maybe budget) didn't make the movie into something great. Hopefully, another director either finds this or thinks of these themes/ideas and makes a better movie; also, hopefully that movie's not called a copycat lol. Though if it was, it'd be a great copycat + more = a better movie nevertheless."
105,"Greetings from Lithuania.I mainly saw ""Possessor"" (2020) because in its genre description it is said ""Horror"", and horror being my favorite genre i picked it up. After seeing ""Possessor"" (2020) i can safely say that it is not a horror movie, not a conventional at least. ""Possessor"" is a very bloody, goory movie story and concept of which more then once reminded me of ""Inception"" - but only on a concept level, because later movie is a masterpiece and ""Possessor"" was just OK. I also liked that it was unpredictable later in a story. Where this movie did suffer was its storytelling i think - i did get the plot but it could have been told say much more involving.Overall, the director and writer Brandon Cronenberg clearly took some inspiration from ""Inception"" and from works of his famous father David Cronenberg (sudden and bloody violence) made a not bad movie overall. I liked of unpredictable it was and somehow bold, cold and bleak - but it a good way. ""Possessor"" is not the best movie around, but it was not bad either."
106,"IMDB need to add gore as a genre, I was expecting some spoopy movie, but end up watching black mirror-esque sci fi gore. The movie was quite alright, though i kinda lost interest halfway, if you miss black mirror twisty twist you'll like this movie."
107,"Possessor is a great conceptual body horror movie with philosophical undertones. There are some scenes that show greatness and the grim payoff In the third act works extremely well. My only concern is how joyless every single scene is played out. I get that the world is supposed to be bleak, but the acting, dialogue and sound design feel either depressing and dull or explode in anger and violence with no other emotional dimensions which makes it really hard to attach to the story and characters. Why should I care about a world without real human emotion, humor and wit? Classic Cronenberg movies somehow always managed to make the world lively and engaging no matter how disturbing the theme was. I hope Brandon Cronenbergs future projects allows for some light in the edgy dark. Don't be afraid to make things likeable and inject some humor and wit into the characters and their world. It goes a long way as proven by the fact that people love to quote funny movie lines and remember satirical elements of the story. Nobody fondly recalls joyless mumbling"
108,"""Possessor"" had the weight of being one of my most anticipated horror movies of 2020, and the good news is - it landed its place in the top echelon of the horror movies of 2020. Not to minimize that, but with the kind of year we've had, it's not saying all that much... Brandon Cronenberg, bearing the name of his father, the legendary David Cronenberg, is very much set on his own path to success and creativity in horror, but the numerous similarities are there - body horror, fascination with technology and people's growingly bizarre relationship with it, futuristic ideas, down to certain kinds of atmosphere etc. Like father, like son, beautiful minds.The story of ""Possessor"" might not be the thickest of plots, but it's full of unease, exploring themes like cyber surveillance, the obsession of wanting to live a life different than one's problematic own, and the question we can never truly answer - just how much a human mind can handle without breaking. A secretive organization uses brain-implant tech that makes it possible for a person to inhabit the body of whoever they choose. They have high-paying clients ordering assassinations via this method, and Tasya Vos (Andrea Riseborough) is the one on the mission, hijacking the brain of a billionaire's son Colin Tate (Christopher Abbott). It's not that much the plot that engages, but rather the enjoyable and scary weirdness of what's happening to these characters. The performances of ""Possessor"", especially those of Riseborough and Abbott - next in line Jennifer Jason-Leigh & Sean Bean, - are highly commendable and is one of the strengths holding ""Possessor"" together so well. This whole goodie package is also wrapped up in an aesthetic equally as bizarre - cinematography, special FX, in-camera effects and a solid musical score by Jim Williams (""Kill List"", ""Raw""), together provide a sticky and impeccable audiovisual atmosphere. By all means, ""Possessor"" is an arthouse horror. Last but not least, ""Possessor"" is a true dessert for the gore hounds, the violence is used with a sure hand and to much effectiveness, all practical and very grisly at times.""Possessor"" didn't 'knock me off my feet' as I might have expected while hyping myself up, but it's an impressive effort, a horror film that will more likely than not gain a cult following. I hear Brandon might make a sequel set in the same universe, though personally I'd like to see yet another separate idea of his in realization. My rating: 8/10."
109,"I really enjoyed this film. Thought the premise of the story was good and well executed. I liked the look of the film and yes it's gory and if you don't care for that sort of thing give it a swerve.
For me it was on of the best sci fi horrors I'd seen for a good few years. I look forward to Brandon cronenbergs next full length feature film as this was a real treat if you like this sort of thing"
110,"Almost perversely disturbing ""Possessor"" get inside of your mind with a brutal power and, as the protagonist melt away from her skin and her life, it makes you go farther and farther away from your comfort zone making you explore raw emotions and uncomfortable thoughts.
It is a truly unique experience, not an easy one but one worth experiencing"
111,"My Synopsis--
Andrea Riseborough plays (Tasya Vos) the agent, who is employed by (Girder's) Organization played by Jennifer Jason Leigh. The Organization uses brain implants to inhabit pre-selected civilian bodies in order to control their behavior and make them commit acts of ultra-violence and assassinations. This Organization is funded by high-paying clients. This particular story focuses on (Vos) inhabiting the body of (Colin Tate) played by Christopher Abbott. (Vos) has shown she has a couple of quirks when the simulation is running. She is much more violent that what the mission entails, as well as struggles with her exit strategy of the simulations. We're only shown a single simulation prior to the film's main sequence. The mission is for (Vos) to assume the role of (Colin) and convince his girlfriend (Ava Parse) played by Tuppence Middleton, that he is a worthy boyfriend to be accepted by her Father (John Parse) played by Sean Bean. (John Parse) is the CEO of a data-mining company that someone has paid big money to (Girder's) Organization to infiltrate the ranks and takeover. During this process (Colin) slowly begins to become aware something isn't right, and struggles with visions during his possession by (Vos) and attempts to regain control, making it very difficult for (Vos) to compete the mission. Meanwhile, back at home (Vos's) husband (Michael) played by Rossif Sutherland and their son (Ira) played by Gage Graham-Arbuthnot are completely unaware of (Vos's) true occupation. It's mentioned during an interview with (Girder) that (Vos) and her Husband (Micheal) are separated, assuming that her job took a toll on the relationship. (Girder) also reveals during another interview that she was once a possessor, but age has taken it's toll on her ability to continue. (Girder) also alludes to the Organization standing to outright own the company they are attempting to infiltrate. (Vos) hides some of the affects this possession takes from her, almost like the process is starting to crumble and not take hold any longer. She never shares these instances with (Girber) leading the viewer to believe that there is a duty that (Vos) feels she has to prove to (Girber) that she's always ready for a new job. (Girber) admits at once point in an interview session that (Vos) is her star performer. There is no reference at any time of other possessor's team within the Organization other than plotters that will do research prior to a mission taking place.Actor performances-
Tasya Vos - B - It seemed to me she had run too many missions
Girber - A - Good pressure boss, explained things clearly
Colin Tate - C - Seemed always ""stuck"" in completing his tasks
Michael Vos - B - Small role, but ending made up for it
Ira Vos - C - Only a single scene where he redeemed himself
Ava Parse - A - Nailed the rich entitled drug-party heiress role
John Parse - B - Nailed the pompous-bullish, successful CEO roleStory-
I was really excited on the premise of this film. As a long standing fan of Horror and Sci-Fi, I think this film manages to pull off both to excite either viewer of their favorite genre. You're in for a treat if you like both! I've never really seen an idea for film like this before, much less pull it off completely with no plot holes. I will admit, narration through the film could have been better as to what the heck was going on at times, but I chalked that up to some of the science shown on-screen wasn't supposed to be fully understood by the viewer. I really liked that the character Vos has a darker side than she was fully willing to admit to Girber, and the ending scene there's a small difference between interview #1 and #2 that if you catch it, seals the film as a winner.Rating-
This film is a strong R. It has gratuitous use of nudity, sexual scenes, illicit drug use, language and ultra-violence level gore. Not kid friendly. This would be okay for a Teen, around aged 16-17 depending on the maturity level. It left me feeling a bit unweary on the lingering effects of the ultra-violent parts. Make no mistake, I liked them, but the thoughts lingered well beyond the film cut to credits with me. I feel this was a solid 8 stars for attempting to pull off something akin to The Matrix, Inception and Jason Bourne movies all-in-one. At no time did it feel ""scary"" I think the Horror side was gore-only. Good film by Brandon Cronenberg. I wish him the best in the future, and sadly it appears this film has no mention of nominations. Which I think is a shame. It's a very tough pitch to make in general dealing with Horror movies are already at a -25 in score to critics, since most feel like they need to be ""scared"" in order for the movie to qualify for Horror. I disagree, I believe modern horror can take two forms. Scares and Gore. This film does gore in spades."
112,"I went totally blind into this flick only had a recommendation from an Australian girlfriend to watch this.Not knowing the director it was funny that I immediately thought of the weird horror flicks of David Cronenberg. Let his son be the director of Possessor.Is it an easy flick? Not at all, flashy and nerving editing and a storyline that some will turn this off. Slow builder as it is it do offer a lot. I was into the story but still some moments it made me think who was who.Why I watched it was the fact that the Australian one said, its gory as hell and I must admit. If you aren't used to the in your face on-camera gore it will turn your stomach. But not only that. There's a lot of nudity and in one shot genitals are shown from male and female. So on that part some could be offended.So after all, not an easy flick on all parts. But if you digged the David flicks from the horror heydays than try this one. And for the gorehounds who are already licking their fingers to search the gore. The things going on with Sean Bean. A must see.Gore 3,5/5 Nudity 4/5 Story 3/5 Effects 5/5 Comedy 0/5"
113,"Brandon versus David and Goliath. Possessor is a film of what the protégé learned from the master. While Brandon keeps in line with David for the corporate influences, (Existenz, bending fictional worlds with reality, Naked Lunch, bending reality versus drug induced psychosis). Brandon finds a medium for corporate take overs with mind assassins, and how an assassin might lose their own identity depending on the target's own mental stability. It was an interesting film after seeing Antiviral, while some of his influence is his father's, he does try to carve out his own in the film industry. Pass or fail, he will come into his own, and when he does make a successful film, it will be a film that will make you question your own reality."
114,"The movie is about implanting another person's consciousness into another person with the objective of killing without a trace.
The main character named Tasya Vos, she's the top killer agent in her company. Not a lot went into her backstory, we do not know what was her motive or drive into doing this line of work, what we as the audience knew about Vos was that she started unraveling and became unstable at her job possibly due to many of possessing other person's body. But she hides this from her boss and continue with the next mission. This part of the movie, the introduction of our main character and the establishment of plot point was interesting. From the very opening act up until this point, the atmospheric feels is very thick, with jarring and eerie score. The cinematography and the coloring for this movie was briliantly done. The problem started with the second act, when Vos was implanted into the next target Tate. It got considerably slow and dull at times. It was so slow that it got tedious and dare I say boring. Although there is some great imaging sequence here and there, still the plot slowly advance. Also, going in from the very beginning, this movie wasnt shy about how explicit the violence could be, and yet I was caught off guard with how gory and violently violent THAT scene was. This scene was not for the faint hearted wimp like me. Until this scene then it dawned on me, this wasn't just a science fiction movie, this was a horror movie.
The conclusion of the plot was... unsatisfactory? Also left me with more questions about Vos's motive, like what's her deal? WHY WAS SHE DOING THIS WORK? All in all, I hate the violent aspect of this movie, love the unsettling eerie atmosphere, love the premise, Love the first act. Especially love the performance as Tasya Vos, credit for the actress!Will I recommend this movie to other people? Probably yes depend on the person, I could see this movie will not work for the general audiences as it could looked a lot like arthouse kind of movie. You know the trope : unneccesary explicit sex scenes, full nudity, some sort of existensial crisis, weird shot of something dissintegrated, very deliberately slow and long scenes, excessive violence, vague motives AND a must have in an Art house movie : vague ending."
115,"This is one of those dialled down chillers that plays out like it wants to be a gritty real-world drama, but has sci-fi underpinnings - which is typical of daddy Cronenberg in the 70s/80s. Possessor plays like a cross between Under The Skin and You Were Never Really Here; the protagonist may as well be an alien hit woman.Where those two films succeed are with UTS's weirdness and YWNRH's tension and mostly unseen brutality. Possessor has the downbeat atmosphere pretty much nailed on, but it struggles with ideas when it comes to depicting the weirdness of being taken over to assassinate an acquaintance and because the brutal attacks are shown in full they are really quite bland compared to YWNRH's violence which mostly takes place off screen and is stronger because of it; anyone who grew up watching Daddy Cronenberg's work won't be shocked by Possessor Uncut's gore.The acting is perfectly fine, but again, everything is very subdued tonally and for that to work there needs to be a a really strong core performance to carry it off. Possessor falls short in terms of having a memorable lead character, and it wheezes a bit in places in terms of pacing - it could easily lose 20 minutes and no one would miss them.If you're looking for a good solid B movie with a throwback style this might just scratch that itch. It'll be interesting to see where Brandon Cronenberg goes from here."
116,"Director Brandon Cronenberg might not ever fully escape the shadow of his iconic father, David Cronenberg, but for horror fans 'Possessor' is well worth a look if only to see the great Andrea Riseborough in action."
117,"I watch so much crap that I don't think rating this 10 stars is too much. Science Fiction with horror elements, sex, nudity, extreme gore, gallons of blood, outstanding performances from everyone involved, a fascinating detail filled story, and superb cinematography. This was a joy to watch. Andrea Riseborough and Chris Abbott were perfect in the leads, both excellent actors and Brandon Cronenberg , David's son, has created a film that is not only fearless, but I believe is a new masterpiece. Not for the squeamish or easily offended."
118,"Blew my mind, and I've been watching a lot of body horror related things recently.The story was fascinating and had a lot of great turns, the acting from the two leads (Andrea Riseborough & Christopher Abbott) is incredible, and the cinematography is striking and quite often creative. It works simultaneously as a thriller and a body horror film, and it really knows how to balance it all.It's a film I can't stop thinking about now. It just comes together in a way that works so well. A definite must watch."
119,"I made that mistake again, thinking Christopher Abbott was in GoT because he looks so much like Kit Harrington. But not exactly a Dad and Son reunion with Sean Bean.Anyway, I liked the premise of this Sci Fi film. Suppose for an instance if science advances enough that an assassin can feel, smell, talk, and commit an assassination of key influential targets paid by governments or business competitors by using another living and breathing person like an avatar and get away with it. With an implant inserted into the host, that person's thoughts, behaviors and actions can be control by a remote counter agent much like a military pilot flies a Predator drone to drop munitions from thousands of miles away. If scientist figure out how the brain works, this could be the next deadly military weapon."
120,"This movie was quit amazing and had all the elements of is father david in it.Weird, very violent and gory, with a twist after another. Highly recommended.Its also very disturbing to watch."
121,"I thought Brandon's first movie, Anti-viral, was interesting but a little flat. This is much better, a truly brutal and dread inducing nasty ride through a disturbing world.Highly recommended. Best viewed knowing as little about it as possible.Also, would highly recommend finding the 'real' copy of the movie. The version on Amazon isn't the original and some of the nudity and the worst of the violence is removed.It's still very violent, but most of the missing graphic scenes are actually contextually important, it's not really like something like Hostel or Saw where it wouldn't really make any difference on your perception of the film or the story.I was incredibly disappointed to have seen the edited version first, and then the original, which is how the director intended for it to be seen.I can understood to a degree the nudity being removed as what's altered is some very explicit material, but I thought we were past the days of censoring violence.The difference is quite noticeable and without going into spoiler territory the original is far more effective to the narrative."
122,"... and I mean that both literally and figuratively -- this is a VERY bloody movie and man would it be utter hell to have someone take over your mind.I just wrote a review about how mainstream critics don't ""get"" horror, elevating attempts at filmmaking ""art"" over the basics that horror fans love. ""Possessor"" is an exception where critics (72 Metacritic Score) and users (7.6 Metacritic Score) agree that it's a pretty damn good flick.The acting is excellent. Andrea Riseborough from ""Mandy"" is creepy odd (again) as a mind-possessing assassin, and Christopher Abbott from ""It Comes at Night"" is a depressed AND possessed soul for the next assassination.There are too many adjectives to list to give the film justice, so here's just a few: disturbing, violent, bloody, mind-bending, visual, provocative,While Brandon Cronenberg may have a similar interest in melding technology and horror as his father David Cronenberg, he is introducing his own style and originality. Very much like like Joe Hill has done with father Stephen King.All of which is nothing but a bonus for horror fans."
123,"Never written a review before but after that ending, wow... I couldn't resist. From start to finish you can feel the pain of Tasya Vos (portrayed incredibly by Andrea Riseborough), instantly grabbing you from the scruff of the neck. Through excellent visual trips and a perfectly suited soundtrack, you really get a feel of how Tasya's mind is tearing apart.Another incredible Christopher Abbott performance as Colin Tate; who has quite the downfall from a loved-up coke head to well.. insanity. Chris really starting to show how much of a titan he is in the horror/thriller world.Such a gripping experience with plenty of great blood and gore and a great cast to supplement. Great concept, executed perfectly and an ending that will leave your mouth open wider than David Cronenberg's arms to his son after seeing this.Also, great to see Yorkshire getting it's representation through the legend Sean Bean making an appearance!"
124,"Although very slow in the first 30-40 minutes; it is worth it in the end. The acting is quite impressive by the male costar. The uncut version is not for the faint of heart, at times very gory. Some of the best cinematography I have seen in a while. Overall this movie is worth the watch at least once."
125,"Brandon Cronenberg is certainly following in daddy's footsteps quite nicely. The film is a bit of a hodge podge of ideas from Avatar, Bourne and Bond flicks, maybe some Scanners thrown in there. I went into this knowing nothing about it, other than it was UNRATED and UNCUT. Yeah, that brings back memories of all those movies I saw repeatedly at the Avon in my hometown growing up, like, seeing The Gates Of Hell three times in two weeks. Couldn't get enough. Anyway, I digress. Yes, this one is really gory, but it's not a horror movie, even if it does have some amazing kill shots. I'm not going to give away the plot, glean what you can from my comparisons. This one may leave you a little traumatized. Not a bad thing for this sort of film. It moves slowly, but it's never dull, and Brandon has a feel for his father's antiseptic charm. The ending is a kick in the teeth. Speaking of teeth, there's a particular scene that will have you really feeling it in the choppers. Go see this movie. There were 4 people in the theater, including myself, and I was there alone. Please, please, please go to the movies, don't make them take that $*** away, too."
126,"It's like horrifying version of Being John Malkovich. Love the Toronto scenery. Great performances, great story, very disturbing visuals and paced quite well.Top notch Cancon."
127,"First you have to kidnap the person you wish to control. Then, position an implant in their head. Then, release them and get in their heads to commit heinous crimes for your corrupt and evil organization. Then, off them before you are pulled safely back. Hope this isn't the future we have to look forward to. For the movie, it was well played and scary considering what they are capable of."
128,"Possessor was a good film from a Brandon Cronenberg and he showed that he has talent in him that also his famous father had,and even if i dont think that this film in any close to be as good as his fathers best ones were,it was still a solid made film that had a good potential in it and it used it in a good way.Cast was also very star filled and even if some actors and characters werent explored as much as i wanted,it was still a fine job.story wasnt nothing new but it had a solid premise and Brandon did a good job while performing it,ending was also very bloody but i liked it,Possessor was a good film that showed how Brandon has a good future in front of him"
129,"Amazing confident second feature from Brandon Cronenberg.Very intelligent script. Amazing visuals and soundtrack. Yes, intellectual. Yes, clinical both in attitude and (for sure!) violence.Funny of course that this triggers all the dimb witted ""worst movie ever"" and ""snorerefest"" reviewers.Really: This isn't for everyone.And it's all the better for itAll hail Cronenberg. Both father and son. Curious how cozy Cronenberg family dinners are though."
130,"Suspenseful, methodical and satisfying sci-fi horror thriller. Visually interesting. The concept is completely original and the execution was perfect."
131,"Definitely a ""Cronenberg"" movie: fascinating, disturbing and surprising."
132,"Slow character development, but felt purposeful,
quite a few original ideas,
brilliantly executed concept which hopefully will receive more recognition with time.
The major beauty in this movie is that everything is done with practical effects. It gives it a more authentic and unsettling feel.Interesting movie , worth the watch at least once."
133,This movie is so Fakd'up in so many ways and I loved it.
134,"""Sometimes that small thought is all it takes to lose control.""Now this is something unforgettable. Since I've been waiting for this ever since Sundance. As the son of David Cronenberg, he lives up to his fathers name. Following his footsteps, this is a visual heavy film. Everything is shot beautifully, even if what's on screen is horrifying. Warm colors are brought out making a vivid picture. Then there's the added visual horror elements. There's only a couple scenes using visual effects that were most interesting to look. Not too much detail is put into it but it feels strange just looking at it. I'm not sure how to explain but it works in this situation. Everything else is done with practical effects. It gives it a more authentic and unsettling feel. The score helps set the offsetting tone as well. And since I saw Possessor Uncut, there's no holding back with the gore. I don't know any place that isn't playing this version but all audiences are warned beforehand. Some may call me a sociopath, but I'm glad they didn't hold back with this. With this story, the excessive gore made the experience so much better. Anyone who is freaked out by gore will definitely not enjoy this, especially the third act.Though Andrea Riseborough is billed as the lead, I felt most of the credit should go to Christopher Abbott. Not that she didn't do well because this is a great performance by her with the screen time she gets. But Christopher Abbott drives the whole film. He has two characters with three different personas. To break it down there is himself, Risenborogh in him, and the third act turns everything crazy. He deserves so much credit as it's his best performance to date. A good chunk of the horror doesn't come from the gore and visuals but rather the characters. Seeing them evolve into their sinister selves over the course of the film is quite interesting. You don't know who you should be siding with. All have evil roots and it's tough to connect with them. But you can't help but hope everything goes well on Risenborough's part.As Cronenberg's second feature film, he proves to be another master of horror. I have yet to see Antiviral but I've heard good things about it. And this isn't necessarily just horror. The sci-fi element bends the genre into a mind-bending film really. With every film of this type, there's always questions to be answered. Possessor does get caught up with how confusing it can get. I mainly understand most of what happened but a little more information would have been nice. Especially the beginning. There isn't much exposition on what we're getting into with this company. The film just starts and keeps going. I'm fine with this but a little more information would be nice. Overall, Possessor really did it for me. As a mind-bending, slow burn, gore-fest this won't hit well with all audience. This is for certain people and those people know who they are. I'm eager to see this again and I hope that is soon."
135,"The title is a bit of a give away I reckon, still I had no idea what I was about to watch, because I had not read anything about the movie. I only knew that some very fine people were involved behind the camera and obviously after seeing it also in front of the camera. Spiritually speaking there may be some things people may want to know or ask - either themselves or the movie itself.There are some things that might be tough to comprehend, but the movie is still easy to follow. Even if I reckon you can have your own thoughts about what the movie is ultimately saying - or what exactly the ending means. Is it good or bad ... and what is that even to begin with? And also what a fun thing to see the word uncut next to it's title on imdb ... having seen this at a festival, I know for sure it was. Hopefully you get the chance to watch it like that too (even if it is at home) - because there are quite some disturbing scenes in it. A few involving violence and blood too (there's also some nudity and some strange ... intercourse ... well then again, some may call it fun, who am I to say how you'll perceive it?) ... not for the faint hearted for sure, but the name Cronenberg should be a hint at that"
136,"POSSESSOR will be out soon. I'll give full thoughts when the embargo lifts but this is a weird, offed up movie and it instantly makes you feel uncomfortable. The opening sequence is something that is totally unexpected and sets the tone for the type of movie that is ahead of you. It might be one of the best opening sequences of the year.For a low budget indie flick, the effects were stunning. The director, Brendan Cronenberg, son of David Cronenberg, used a lot of practical effects and the makeup team was very efficient in making believable and realistic prosthetics that never looked cheap. Cronenberg also crafts a film that is as violent as his father's films. Eastern Promises was probably the most violent Cronenberg film, and it is nice to see some of that DNA weaved into this film. It is is unflinchingly violent and very hard to watch at many times. It's slow build to these violent acts end up paying off in the end thanks to clear character motivations.My issue with the movie is that SEAN BEAN DOESN'T DIE!!! Nah just kidding. If I had one issue with it, it would be that while motivations are clear and of course this is a low stakes, not as bombastic as big budget movies plot, the plot felt a bit weak. It never felt like it amounted to anything.Full YouTube review come soon"
137,"Just plain stupid. it has no finish, no logic. waste of time"
138,"The subject of the film is interesting, a web brain implant through which one can control the will of one person remotely through another, in a not very noble purpose, that of carrying out assassinations to order. The way it is staged, the annoying background music, the explicit murder scenes with far too much blood, make the film difficult to teach even for the horror genre. I do not recommend it."
139,"Well done movie. I hate the killer person. And there is no justice in this one. Ugly human being, she is."
140,"I must say that this reminded me of a William Gibson story (which is always a plus) - and is nicely done, in my view.I can see from the comments that this has had a very varied reception, including from some who have seen only the redacted version. I watched it on BFI Player which, as far as I can tell, has the full uncut version.For me, this blend of sci-fi, horror (concept) and gore (execution) is right up my street and this is the best I've seen for quite a while. Some of the acting was a bit flat but the leads were good and it's always a pleasure to see Tuppence even in a minor role (I'd love to know how she goes from the warm-heartedness of something like Fisherman's Friends to a much darker piece like this...)Recommended."
141,"Loved this movie, I think nobody else will really. I love the Macabe, Creep and Grotesque. The movie was full of it. What is great, the movie had no relatable themes in it what so ever, meaning there is no chance of it ever being real. The movie seems like it was written by an AI. It has some incredible Artistic moments which could inspire the Blackness in you. This is how the grotesque is portrayed in this movie. It is not a pleasant movie, it will not leave anyone feeling good. I loved it. Lastly, all the characters look great, plenty of nudity and the personalitys do seem beleivable in an unbeleivable setting. The setting is also highly origional."
142,"This is my second Brandon Cronenberg film, I watched Antiviral a few weeks back and have to say I'm enjoying his work.
Possessor takes the grotesque theme of humans enmeshed with each other and machinery and spits out a simultaneously slow paced yet nail biting sci-fi film. Both lead actors play the idea of possessor and possessed fantastically, in the latter half of the film I was genuinely on edge trying to guess which character had won the fight for supremacy.
The ending (I won't ruin it) felt like a punch to the gut, so emotionless which made it all the more horrifying.
At under two hours long, I would recommend this to anyone wanting a film that merges the boundaries of sci-fi and horror, and does so in the least flashy or blockbuster was possible. A big tick from me."
143,"Brandon lives up to the Cronenberg name with Possessor. Chilly atmosphere. Nefarious corporations. Dangerous technology. Heady themes. And, of course, horrifically beautiful practical effects. And buckets of blood. Think Under the Skin but with the violence dialed to 11. The narrative leaves a bit to be desired and the ideas could've been more satisfyingly explored, but the icy tone and audacious visuals are more than enough to carry it.Solid 4/5"
144,"Brandon Cronenberg has inherited his Dad's obsession with depicting the inconsistencies and ambiguities of one's self identity in the face of social and cultural powers like media that seek to remake that identity. Of course, both Cronenbergs are masters of bloody variations, and can be seen in Brandon's recent Possessor, a horror/sci-fi buffet of blows to the mouth, neck and everywhere else with exceptional surges of the red stuff, rivalling that Shining elevator scene.Tasya (Andrea Riseborough) and Girder (Jennifer Jason Leigh) control the brains of randomly selected victims through brain implants. The victims subsequently become assassins lacking free will, well mostly. Colin (Christopher Abbott), a handsome but major assassin targeted to kill his future father in law, John Parse (Sean Bean). Colin would like out, or ""Pull me out"" as the film repeats.Subsequently he and Tasya seem to change bodies or faces or both in Cronenberg's attempt to fuse Jumanji with Face/Off although the latter is a disservice to young men who love the idea of changing bodies without carnage. As Tanya begins to lose power, Colin may take over her to the extent of trapping her forever in his body. She, meanwhile marvels at the male body she inhabits. Two for one and identity become a complicated affair.Actually, while the film is partly low-rent Matrix crossed with Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it does make a convincing argument supporting God's big gift to us of free will and negating the many arrows of corporate sabotage to our psyches. Cronenberg manages to make this challenging existential sci-fi romp into an enjoyable thriller. However, even those corporate bad boys are not as much in love with the representation of murder as Brandon Cronenberg.Helpfully, Colin explains some of the convoluted, inscrutable, and bloody business:""Just think, one day your wife is cleaning the cat litter and she gets a worm in her, and that worm ends up in her brain. The next thing that happens is she gets an idea in there, too. And it's hard to say whether that idea is really hers or it's just the worm. And it makes her do certain things. Predator things. Eventually, you realize that she isn't the same person anymore. She's not the person that she used to be. It's gotta make you wonder, whether you're really married to her... or married to the worm.""There's identity and free will-Cronenberg at least made me think about them. Now putting those thoughts together coherently, let me take another stab at it so to speak after I cool off from this chapter."
145,"Very ...er, Cronenburg-esque. The sense of violation of personal space -- the mind -- is palpable."
146,"""Tapping into the similar ground of inhabitant/host dyad explored in his father's EXISETNZ (1999), not least by the presence of Jennifer Jason Leigh here, both star in both films, POSSESSOR uses this hard sci-fi invention of body-possessing as an unethical means of assassination. It is operated by an unspecified organization whose killer of the first order is Tasya Vos (a transmutative Riseborough), and Girder (Leigh) is her superior.""read the full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks"
147,"Can't recall watched any movies that left me literally stunned and speechless momentarily yet uncomfortably siated but wanting more. It's a very measured, steady slide downwards toward a sinister darkening rabbit hole of mind mashing cloning realities leading to certain deaths in one. Violent. Unapologetic. Believable yet unwelcome. Brilliantly crafted to numb your senses whilst you seek solace post movie ending, to return to your own real world still feeling uneasy."
148,"Possessor is a Canadian science-fiction thriller directed by Brandon Cronenberg and starring actresses and actors such as Jennifer Jason Leigh and Christopher Abbott. Even though the film is a slow burn, it includes quite a few graphic scenes and also features some pornographic elements. This is certainly not a movie for children or teenagers or the whole family.The story is quite intriguing and includes several twists and turns that end up being somewhat difficult to follow towards the conclusion. The film presents a secretive organization that uses brain-implant technology to temporarily inhabit bodies of other people in order to commit unsolvable crimes. Tasya Vos is shown possessing the body of a hostess who suddenly grabs a knife and murders a businessman. In order to pull out of the foreign body, Tasya Vos is supposed to make the hostess commit suicide but she hesitates and gets shot by the police instead. The demanding job has taken its toll on Tasya Vos who asks for some time off to rekindle with her estranged husband and son who know nothing of her job. She realizes that she has become hesitant, isolated and depressive but accepts the next job nevertheless. Tasya Vos takes control of a young man who dates the daughter of an ambitious businessman. She is supposed to murder the daughter and her father and make the boyfriend commit suicide. The job however becomes more difficult than anticipated when Tasya Vos discovers details about her host that she wasn't briefed about beforehand. Things quickly spiral out of control and take an unexpected personal turn.This ambitious movie convinces on numerous levels. The story is certainly intriguing and keeps you guessing how things might unfold until the very last scene. The film has a gloomy, mystyerious and numbing atmosphere from start to finish. Especially the cold sound effects and efficient lighting techniques enhance the film's dystopian vibes. The acting performances are stellar and especially Andrea Riseborough convinces as conflicted lead character whose life is spinning out of control. Despite its slow pace, the movie grabs the viewer's attention with sudden violent outbursts and pornographic elements that might however feel unnecessarily exaggerated at some points.The film's biggest downside is its own ambition. The final thirty minutes introduce a few too many twists and turns that can be understood when analyzed in hindsight but that harm the film's flow. The movie's eventful resolution doesn't blend in with the much calmer exposition, rising action, climax and even falling action. The director should have taken more time to properly tell the ending of the story instead of rushing to the conclusion.Overall, Possessor is a very atmospheric dystopian science-fiction film with an interesting story, intriguing characters and vivid outbursts of violence and some surreal pornographic elements. The movie isn't always easy to digest due to its overall slow pace contrasted by a rushed finale but there are enough creative ideas in here for the film to deserve more attention and acclaim. If you are a genre fan and like the works of Brandon's famous father David Cronenberg, then you should rent or stream this movie."
149,"Wow, this sci-fi thriller film explores a future in which a secret (possible government) organisation has created a machine that operatives use to take control of other people's minds. They are a hitman club that assassinates high power (possibly corrupted) individuals & murders the possessed hosts thereafter so they leave no evidence of their crimes.I had very low expectations for this film but this actually went in its favour & I found myself enjoying it more than I could imagine. I found it fascinating that the film makers did not shy away from the murder scenes which is more explicitly gory than you would expect. The storyline is great and it is interesting to see the internal conflicts between the host and ""possessor"" play out for the viewers to see.However, half way through this film the tables are turned & this begins a cat and mouse game between possessor & host. The prize is who becomes triumphant & takes control & it is a matter of life and death...They assembled a great cast with cameos from the reliable Sean Bean & watchable Jennifer Jason Leigh. But Kudos to the 2 leads as Andrea Riseborough & Christopher Abbott excelled in their performances and they more than carried the film. Those protagonist and antagonist were the heart and soul of this film. The ending seems organic and not forced like similar films of this genre."
