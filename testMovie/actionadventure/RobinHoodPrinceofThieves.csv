0,"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is a movie that I've watched since I was a little girl and I still to this day absolutely adore it. Now granted I know that there was a few flaws with this film as I grew up and noticed that maybe Kevin Costner's accent wasn't so British or Christian Slater's. But if we all always complained about accents, I think we wouldn't enjoy movies as much. I love Robin Hood because it has action, adventure, romance, horror, magic, everything you can imagine is in this film. Not to mention that I think we got pretty darn good performances. My personal favorite is out of Alan Rickman as the Sheriff of Nottingham, he is absolutely hilarious and a terrific villain. This is my favorite Robin Hood story of all time.Robin of Locksley, an English nobleman, is captured and jailed in a dungeon in Jerusalem along with his comrade, Peter. With their execution inevitable, Robin engineers an escape, saving the life of a Moor, Azeem in the process; Peter dies in the attempt and has Robin swear to protect his sister Marian. Robin makes the long journey back to England with Azeem, who claims he must accompany Robin until the debt of saving his life is repaid. In England, with King Richard I gone, the cruel Sheriff of Nottingham rules over the land with fear, aided by his brute cousin, Guy of Gisbourne along with the precognitive evil witch, Mortianna , and the corrupt Bishop of Hereford. At Locksley castle, Robin's kind father Lord Locksley has been killed by the Sheriff's men, after refusing to join them for the Sheriff's unknown but treacherous scheme. Robin and Azeem arrive to find Robin's formerly luxurious abode of Locksley Castle destroyed and his father, murdered. Lord Locksley's loyal servant, Duncan, has survived, though his eyes were removed. With his lands and reputation gone Robin swears to avenge his father's murder. Robin then begins by seeking out, Maid Marian, the cousin of the king and his childhood friend. He is immediately attracted to Marian, although she does not return the feelings, which poses a problem because Nottingham also has his sights set on her. While Robin, Azeem and Duncan escape the revenge seeking Gisboune and his soldiers, they seek shelter in the Forest of Sherwood, where they come across Little John, and a large group of woodsmen, all of whom were outlawed through the tyranny of the Sheriff. After proving his skill in single combat, Robin is accepted into their group and eventually becomes their leader, though Will Scarlet, one of Robin's men, is constantly undermining his leadership. Robin encourages his men to fight back against Nottingham and begins to train them to defend themselves while they build weapons and homes in the forest, it's their time ""to take it back"".If you haven't seen Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves I highly recommend that you do, honestly I don't know why anyone would not enjoy this film just a little bit. Like I said, it has everything to make a film great. My favorite scene, hard to choose from so many, is the ending battle scene where they discover that Robin Hood is alive and he is there at the castle to save his beloved Marian, it's a great scene that keeps you on the edge of your seat. So please just get past the accents, give this movie a chance, it's a terrific story and a wonderful movie that I will still watch and probably will even more so as I grow older. Besides I have to just to see Alan Rickman threaten Robin Hood with a spoon, lol, greatest threat ever.10/10"
1,"The summer of 1991 was a lousy one for movies; there were only a few that stood out amid dozens of crummy releases. The only movies that summer that I admired were 'Terminator 2,' 'Thelma & Louise,' and this one, which still stands as one of the most entertaining action-adventure movies I've seen.No, it isn't a masterpiece, on any level. Yes, I realize that Kevin Costner lacks a satisfactory British accent (he doesn't even attempt one). But the movie is still a fun, rip-roaring piece of escapism, sort of like 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' only without the special effects.Costner may seem miscast as Robin of Locksley, but there's no doubt that he had the physicality and screen presence to convincingly hold our attention as a larger-than-life hero. He'd just come off 'Dances With Wolves,' and so it was a thrill to see him on horseback again (it still is, in 'Open Range'). I'm willing to concede that he's no Olivier, but in the action hero mold, he still cut an exciting figure.I also enjoyed Alan Rickman's great, over-the-top portrayal of the Sheriff of Nottingham. Out of place? You betcha. Fun? Funny? Wicked? Hey, that's why we pay admission.The sets are all dank and gloomy and wonderful. The action is well-staged and had audiences on their feet all those years ago. Sherwood Forest is appropriately dense and spooky-looking. OK, so the movie has Christian Slater in it. I didn't say it was perfect.'Robin Hood' marked the beginning of the end of Kevin Costner's unanimous popularity with audiences. Everyone started playing the part of Hollywood bean-counter and worrying about 'Waterworld's' budget. But you know what I like about both these movies? No CGI. I am sick and tired of CGI movies. Popping the deluxe 'Robin Hood' DVD into the old player is a refreshing treat and a thumb in the eye of digital junk like 'Pirates of the Caribbean.'"
2,"Two reasons to watch this film:1) Alan Rickman2) Robin and Marian falling into each other's arms, oh so dramatic, and he says in a very guttural/passionate Kevin Costner way, ""I would die for you."" Almost as good as Kevin Kline in ""French Kiss,"" when he runs up to Meg Ryan in the hotel and says ""I want you..."" giving this little hand gesture which makes it obvious to everyone except Kate that Luc has surrendered to her charms.In conclusion: a terrifically unerring cheesy romantic drama/comedy, with a hint of Christian Slater bad boy and a dash of Morgan Freeman cool. If you've still got the thirteen year old girl within, give it a shot. If not, Alan Rickman's still awesome."
3,"I have seen Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves so many times and yet it still thrills me the 100th time as much as it did the first.  I just can't ever get enough of this near perfect adventure film.I've always cherished films set in medieval times.  There's just something about the plights of the oppressed class and the simple heroics of the man who steps forward to fight for honor and better lives for the dismal.  Then there are the luxuriant castles, the dashing sword fights, the extravagant costumes, the tragically beautiful princess he's destined to fall in love with, and the evil power-hungry villain who will stop at nothing to be King.OK, it's a bit of a clich√©, but this formula makes for the perfect escapist film and one thrilling and emotional ride.  No, it isn't original, but it's just got everything you'd ever want from a film.The story of Robin Hood has been done so many times, and (unlike most of his other roles) Kevin Costner is not only believable, but actually quite good this time (well, except for the accent, but nobody's perfect).Alan Rickman is just flawlessly devious as the Sheriff of Nottingham. Nobody could have done it better, and he also had the best lines (""Because it's dull, it'll hurt more!"")This was sadly Kevin Costner's last great film, as he went on to star in such duds as Waterworld and the dismal The Postman.  Christian Slater, Morgan Freeman, Sean Connery, and especially Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio give their all, creating a truly emotional and powerful film.  I don't understand why the ratings are so low.The ending is just beautiful.  I boo at the sheriff, cheer for Robin, and cry during Robin and Marian's post-sword fight embrace every time, and you will too if you ignore the cynics and give this adventure a chance.9/10"
4,"Wow, this film seems to have annoyed some people. What a fuss about it being historically inaccurate, or that Azeem found the Chinease invention of gunpowder etc etc. WHO CARES! Don't nit pick at a film like this and you'll enjoy it. As for Kevin Costner not having an English accent, I don't really care, since it's a lot better then the other Robin Hood movie that was made in England, and was unlucky enough to be released at the same time. (I think it was simply called 'Robin Hood') OK,so Robin Hood IS supposed to be English, and yeah, Kev Costner could at least have tried an English accent, but if we're going to go that far, then they may as well have got an English actor instead of an American one, but somehow, I don't think Costner could have been bettered. He makes an excellent Robin Hood. Alan Rickman is brilliant as the hilarious Sherrif of Nottingham ('Shut up you TWIT!')It's great fun, and one of those film to watch with your feet up and a big bar of chocolate....."
5,"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves was one of the best films of 1991, a triumph even over the special effects hype of Terminator 2: Judgement Day.Despite the critics' complete and utter distaste for the film, I found it fun, well-acted, and fast-paced.  Great performances abound including Morgan Freeman as the Moorish warrior Azeem, Alan Rickman as the hysterical Sheriff of Nottingham, and Kevin Costner as our stalwart Robin of Locksley.There are great action sequences including the battle against the hired Celts and Nottingham's soldiers and the final confrontation at the climax of the film.Finally, don't be put off by Costner's lack of an English dialect.  It doesn't hurt the film at all, and is just something critics were instantly attracted to, as it is their job to find faults.Highly recommended."
6,"Eight hundred years ago, Richard the Lionheart led the third Great Crusade to reclaim the Holy Land from the Turks... Most of the young English noblemen who flocked to his banner never returned home... The film opens near Jerusalem in a terrible dungeon where Robin of Locksley is about to show the 'English' courage...Locksley manages to escape with a fellow prisoner, a Moor called Azeem, and flees home to England... On his arrival to Britain, the prodigal son finds dark forces plotting against his absent king... His father has been slain and his lands confiscated by the evil Sheriff of Nottingham...To evade Gisborn's soldiers, Locksley heads off to the supposedly haunted Sherwood Forest, where he takes his chance with ghosts, and where he is accosted by a band of outlaws...Like Burt Lancaster in 'The Flame and the Arrow,' Costner tries to lead the woodsmen in a revolt against injustice and tyranny, but misses the youthful exuberance and passion of Dardo... Costner looks handsome as the legendary Prince of Thieves who must use his mastery of archery, siege warfare, and combat strategy to rescue his beloved damsel... Morgan Freeman looks great as Azeem, the wizard with uncommon clarity of mind, who vows to repay Robin for saving his life... His knowledge of science is a surprising blow... Mary Elizabeth Manstrantonio is Robin's beautiful and clever companion whose love for the arrogant young nobleman led her to see him taking her advice in Sherwood Forest...Alan Rickman fluctuates between being a comic buffoon and a dangerous madman... He plays the Sheriff of Nottingham who has no limit to his ambitions... Christian Slater is the hot tempered 'turncoat' with enough reason to hate Robin than any one else...Geraldine McEwan is the ugly witch who saw the 'painted man' haunting her dreams... Michael McShane is the natural charisma who would not strike a fellowman of the cloth... In fact he will help him pack for his journey with lots of gold...Michael Wincott is the Sheriff's nefarious cousin who justifies his intrusion with news of profound value: 'I met a hooded man today who made me warn you not to harm his people.'Nick Brimble is the best man of the woods who challenges Robin for his sacred gold medallion...Walter Sparrow is the loyal servant to the Locksleys who has lost his vision by the Sheriff's own cruelty...Harold Innocent is the corrupt churchman who accuses innocent men of witchcraft and let them die...There are beautiful, breathtaking, and amusing scenes: Robin's father, dressed in his black battle armor on top his black stallion, preparing to battle the 'men in masks'; sweeping shots of the English countryside as Robin and Azeem escape Sir Guy of Gisborn and his soldiers; the bout with quarterstaves across a stream; plenty of flaming arrows flowing through the greenwood along with some exciting fighting; and like Burt Lancaster in ""The Flame and the Arrow,"" who pauses in the middle of a frantic battle to plant a kiss on a kitchen maid, Alan Rickman plants his kiss on Maid Marian in the middle of his frantic duel with Costner...The majestic cameo (one of the best in epic movies) at the end of the film by a great, iconic figure, makes the movie just the right mix of adventure, humor, and romance..."
7,"Although i turned my nose up at this film when first watched fifteen years ago, a second appraisal and a few grey hairs later forces me to see it for what it truly is; a great swashbuckling comedy romp.As the pace built, my unease at the somewhat incongruous accents dissipated and i was left to enjoy a great film with some fine performances. Notably from Michael McShane as Friar Tuck and Alan Rickman as the evilly comic Sheriff of Nottingham.The pace of the film rarely slackens, building up to a rip roaring finish.Enjoy."
8,"Robin Hood:Prince Of Thieves is an all-star rehash of one of cinema's oldest and most popular stories. Kevin Costner takes the title role and proves to be handsome enough and swashbuckling enough to do justice to the role during the action scenes. However, during the film's quieter moments, Costner's American accent grates a little amid the Sherwood Forest surroundings. The story doesn't particularly need explaining, but for people who have lived on Mars for their whole lives here it is. Robin of Locksley, a young soldier, returns from the Crusades to find the city of Nottingham and its surrounding area terrorised by the evil Sherrif of Nottingham (Alan Rickman). Robin takes refuge in the nearby Sherwood Forest, where he gathers a band of woodland outlaws who are always stealing money and treasure taken by the Sherrif and giving it back to the poor. His dashing antics impress Maid Marian (Mary Elisabeth Mastrantonio), a childhood friend, and he quickly becomes popular with the poor and honest folk who nickname him Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves. The film is very old-fashioned, but it occasionally gives away its 1991 release status with modern touches (the fancy camera-work in which the camera is seemingly fixed upon an arrow as it is fired at a target; the introduction of a Moorish warrior character [Morgan Freeman] to broaden the film's cultural reference; Rickman's self-deprecating pantomimic turn as the wicked Sherrif). On the whole, it is an entertaining film with a good balance between the action and the romance. The best performance - surprisingly - comes from Michael Wincott who oozes menace as the Sherrif's despicable cousin Guy of Gisbourne. There are some quite significant factual errors, the best (by ""best"" I mean ""funniest"") of which is when Robin and his Moorish companion stand at the foot of the white cliffs of Dover and Robin tells him: ""by nightfall we will dine with my father!"" Quite a feat, since Nottinghamshire is about 200 miles away and this pair are travelling on foot!"
9,"I've seen several Medeval era films, but none of  them are as fun to watch as Robin Hood-Prince of Thieves. This is one of thoser enjoyable movies that you are going to watch over and over. Okay, I'll admit that this movie is predictable. However its fun to watch even though you can figure out what is going to happen with the plot,after all who doesn't know the legend of Robin Hood anyway-Right! Lets face it- and Be honest, there are no surprises in the plot-you knew before you seen this film that he was going to steal from the rich and give to the poor, and he was going to be at war with the sherrif of Notingham. bit this film is just a fun joy-ride. the acting is just okay, and the costumes are over exageratted.- however this films gives you a good classic story, great stunts,very good action sequences, good specail effects,an excellent music score, and several scenes of comic relief. and its all packaged up as an action adventure that is Great Fun to watch. I own a copy of this film and I will watch it on average 2 or 3 times a year- this film never gets old to me. I recommend this film to any one between the ages of 8 years old to 80 years old - you're gonna love it.(If you liked this film also see a movie called ""First Knight""-1995 an action adventure/love story about Sir. Lancelot of Camalot)I give Robin Hood-Prince of Thieves 5 out of 5 stars- A perfect film for your family, everyone in your household will love it-and so will you."
10,I have seen this movie over 10 times. Years later it's still stands strong. It's an awesome movie that I WILL watch again.
11,Absolutely love it!!! Could watch it again and again
12,"The legendary Sherwood forest's hero Robin Locksly (Kevin Kostner) again and Lady Mariam (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) along with a Moor (Morgan Freeman) and his Merrie men : Will Scarlett (Christian Slater), Friar Tuck and Little John facing off a wicked Sheriff of Nottingham (Alan Rickman) and Guy Gisbourne (Michael Wincott). The story is indirectly based on historic events and developed during third Crusade , Robin is imprisoned and is serving under orders of Richard Lion Heart (Sean Connery) who fights against Saladin and conquers Acre . In route England Richard was captured by Leopold II of Austria and ransomed by his own subjects . He briefly returned England to put down a revolt against him , his brother John without Land takes over the kingdom with his underlings Sheriff of Nottingham (Alan Rickman) and Guy Gisbourne (Michael Wincott). One time evaded Robin and returned to England he'll confront against the former . The movie has great action sequences well staged with stylish and vitality , tongue-in-cheek , adventures , romance and is pretty amusing . Although is a little revisionist about characters , personages and time where is developed the action in a dirty , gritty Middle Age, spectators partially disapproved the changes of classic canon . Seven years later to ¬®Fandango¬® film , director Kevin Reynolds and Kevin Costner re-teamed but with much bigger budget . The final product looked as although the actors learn the screenplay and decided the best issue was to take a good time and amuse themselves and both managed to stage some excellent action scenes , hopefully without coming to blows themselves . Kevin Costner is fine but Morgan Freeman comes up the film as the civilized and naive Moor brought by Robin from Crusades . Special mention to Alan Rickman as an evil and crazed sheriff in a comic and sensationalistic interpretation . Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is memorable and attractive . Impeccable cinematography by Douglas Milsone . Movie is shot on natural sets and English woods and cathedral and interior scenarios with impressive production design . Magnificent and spectacular musical score by Michael Kamen . The song ¬®every thing I do it for you ¬® was nominated for Academy Award . The same year was exhibited ¬®Robin Hood¬® by John Irvin with Patrick Bergin and Uma Thurman but was a flop though the critics considered a best adaptation . The classic rendition is ¬®The adventures of Robin Hood¬® by Michael Curtiz with Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland."
13,I loved this movie. It had drama and kept me in my seat when I saw it. Kevin Costner was wonderful in the role of Robin Hood. He has a way of keeping you interested in any movie he is in. The way this movie was shot showed a diversity of feeling and really made you think that they wanted to do the best job ever on showing everything from laughter to heartfelt sadness. I hope that people who haven't seen this movie will really consider seeing it sometime. whether by buying the DVD or by renting the movie. It will be well worth it. I would rate this movie as one of the top ten movies that i have seen. You can't get much better that a good Kevin Costner movie and you can't get much better than a good drama. I know that some people would not agree with this opinion but I'm pleased with what I saw in this movie.
14,"I don't like action films, i don't like hack and slash but i love this.For me every actor does a reasonable job and Alan Rickman is outstanding as the sheriff of Nottingham, the lack of a credible English accent is not a worry to me and the flexible use of locations is also not a problem. The story is great, the screenplay is wonderful with its lack of self-conciousness. All the elements of a great epic are there, love, hate, greed, honesty.The anachronisms really add to the film, the action scenes are tremendous. And yes i like the arrow-cam.Don't  be cynical be nice, enjoy the ride."
15,"***MAY CONTAIN LITTLE SPOILERS***I watched ""The Prince of Thieves"" once again two days ago and it is still one of the most brilliant movies ever made. Despite the fact the crew had so many obstacles while making the film.Robin of Locksley (Kevin Costner) returns to England from his crusades with a Maori warrior Azeem (outstanding Morgan Freeman) and finds out that the evil sheriff of Nottingham (superb Alan Rickman) has taken over his fathers lands. From that one there begins a war to make a difference in sheriff's terrorizing Nottingham. Robin becomes Hood and he is fighting to give the good days back to the people as they deserve it. There is a little bit of everything in the film. There is adventures, excitement, romance, humor, action. Everything you could ever wish from the great, enjoyable film! If you liked ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" starring by Errol Flynn you will also enjoy this timeless story about the man who stole from the rich and gave it to the poor!The film making was a struggle right from the start. The producers had some difficulties to hire a competent director to the job. Even the production manager and the other heads of department were hired before the director. There was a bit hurry to make ""Prince of Thieves"" because there was two other Robin Hood pictures coming. They were just like in a race. Then a man called Kevin Reynolds was hired to the job of directing. Then the production team was short of lead actor to play Robin. Other major parts Morgan Freeman, Alan Rickman and Christian Slater were already in place. Robin Wright was replaced with Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio to play Maid Marian because of Wright's pregnancy. Then there came Kevin Costner. He only signed up for the job because of Kevin Reynolds. After casting everybody the working team came across the difficulty of the lack of enough time. There was also some rough times between Costner and Reynolds. Even the guys had some disagreement the film opened in the year 1991 and managed to snatch a 25 million dollars at the opening weekend and was later going to bag 390 million dollars worldwide. Not bad if the production had some of bad critic and problems behind them. Obviously even Costner and Reynolds managed to put their hatred aside because later they teamed up in the flop ""Waterworld"" which was by the way then (1995) the most expensive movie in the world! (Whopping 175 million dollars spent) Even if the film contains some of the most disturbing mistakes in film making it does not effect on the result. So what if Robin's hair is suddenly turn from wet to dry and again back to wet it does not reflect to the essence of this marvelous piece of history. It is worth waiting the last scene where legendary Sean Connery makes an appearance as King Richard the Lionheart! (Connery donated his 400,000 dollar fee to charity)The legendary and undying ballad ""Everything I Do (I Do It For You) by Bryan Adams is the best movie theme song in the history of film making!Worth to watch with it's faults and all!"
16,"I cannot understand all the nit picking where this great and entertaining film is concerned. I have read through all the posts and the main concern is about accents. Why? The film was exciting, well plotted, great scenery, fun and campy. My favorite reasons for loving this adventure is because of the star---Kevin Costner. I didn't even know who he was at the time, even though he had just won two Oscars for Dances With Wolves. I loved the Robin Hood tales and knew this was the one summer movie of 1991 that I had to see. And see it I did. I went back four times. So many people cheer on Alan Rickman and skewer Kevin Costner. That is not fair. So many believe they were just as much enemies off screen as on screen. I don't believe that to be true, either. Why can't people just leave this delicious and fun movie alone once and for all? Leave those of us who enjoy seeing it time and time again alone, because we don't care about the little goofs, the lack of accents,or any other silly bit of trivia. Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves gets a ten plus from this fan. It will always be my sentimental favorite of the great actor Kevin Costner."
17,"Escaping death in Jerusalem, Robin of Locksley returns to his England home with Moor companion Azeem in tow. However he finds his home burnt to the ground, his father slandered and murdered and the poor marginalised to within an inch of their lives. Branded an outlaw by the evil Sheriff of Nottingham, Robin flees into Sherwood Forrest where he brings together a group of ragtag rebels ""led"" by a man called John Little. As his popularity grows, Robin becomes a massive thorn in the side of the Sheriff, forcing him to take harsher action.Younger viewers coming to this film on television may not appreciate that this film was made at a time when the presence of Kevin Costner was a bonus and indeed almost a selling point. Yes, I know this sounds like crazy talk from an older man who has seen too many movies to be good for him but it is true and Robin Hood is a fine example of a so-so film that was built partly on his star power. Of course the downside of this is that the film itself is not that good because it has his and others' names to let it carry it. The plot is well known but rather annoyingly touched with modernisms and Americanisms to the detriment of the telling (whether this be the accents, the errors or just the attitude). This also contributes to the lack of depth in the film and generally, although it looks slick, it doesn't provide anything in the way of emotional engagement ¬ñ despite the fact that it spawned the manipulative and saccharine Bryan Adams hit that seemed to taint everyone's wedding back in 1992.The direction is glossy but it cannot get to the heart of anything and Reynolds also fails to get that much out of his cast. As a result Costner simply trades on his rather stiff charm, occasionally enjoying himself but generally taking the whole thing too seriously. Rickman effortlessly dominates the film by chewing the scenery in each and every scene ¬ñ his colourful performance makes Costner (who can be good) look as stiff as a board. I've never seen the appeal of Mastrantonio at the best of times and this is not the best of times. She is dull and pretty poor all round. Freeman is a good face but is a modernisation too far. Slater is pointless although support from Wincott, Blessed, Brimble and a few others is good if not that great.Overall then this is a rather joyless spectacle but one that is glossy enough to perhaps do the job for undemanding viewers. It isn't that much fun and the attempts at emotional engagement are mostly cloying and sentimental. The cast are mixed but the only one able to inject life into the rather stiff material is Rickman, who easily livens his scenes but cannot carry the film. Worth a look if you are in a undemanding mood but just don't expect anything more than the blockbuster basics."
18,"The first time i saw this movie was in early 90's, not so long after the release. It was a time of video salons, so my parents rented a crappy pirated VHS copy of this film with a single-voice semi-amateur dubbing. As far as i can remember, the quality of the video and sound was all but horrible.But i was around 10, and it meant absolutely nothing to me. After all, at that moment it seemed that i was watching the greatest movie of all time. Because it's an adventure, and not some random one but about Robin Hood! And it has magic, people in cool costumes, sword fighting, bow shooting and, the best of all, the tree houses. And not just a few of them, but a whole village on trees. Accompanied by a happy ending and a song they made so much fuss about on TV, this movie had everything that a pre-adolescent boy could've wished for.Now, two decades later, i got a chance to re-watch Robin Hood. Except for the technical quality of the media - now the video and sound were their best - and the English language track this time, the movie had no changes. One thing that really changed was me. I'm no longer a 10-year old boy, and it implies a completely different viewing angle and perception.The first thing i must say is that, being a boy, i hardly realized how silly this movie is. From the scene with people getting out of a manhole in the sandy street of medieval Jerusalem - yeah, a manhole in the sand, i kid you not! - it was clear that no historical accuracy or at least logical consistency is to be expected from this film. But there was still hope for it, since one doesn't need to be historically accurate or logical to be a great adventure, and the best proof is the Indiana Jones films.Unfortunately, Robin Hood is no Indiana Jones. And definitely not because the topic it's based on is inferior, for it's not. This film had all the potential to be the landmark of its time and one of the best adventure movies of, if not all time then, at least, the 90's. But a few director's choices wasted this opportunity.First of all, the film is too thin for its length. For your information, Robin Hood goes for more than two and a half hours. Yet for this huge screen time, we get to see not nearly enough of ""robinhooding"" itself. With lots of not so necessary and slow paced scenes like sheriff's hoodlums burning peasant villages or the sheriff himself running around his castle and throwing hissy fits, you might wish for a bigger lot of cool action moments. Yet there are only a handful of those throughout the whole movie.Another thing that kinda spoils the enjoyment is the overused comedic angle. Indeed, there must be some comedy in adventure, otherwise it would turn itself into drama. But in Robin Hood there clearly was too much of it. Mostly due to the Alan Rickman's character of the sheriff. I mean, we all know that he's a great actor and can play super vicious villains like Hans Gruber. Yet in this film all he could do is buffoon around, scream nonsense and make preposterous faces. Even out of his own death he made a clown's performance. And since he's the main opposing force in the movie, it kinda undermines the value of the confrontation and transforms adventure into visiting a spooky room attraction in an amusement park: it may look scary sometimes, but you are simply 100% sure that all is gonna be okay.Yet, with all these flaws, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves still leaves a pleasant aftertaste. Maybe because it's a movie of my childhood, and although it doesn't live up to the impression it made back then, it's still nice to see something that you loved when you were a kid. Maybe because of the whole nostalgia about 90's that it brings, seeing all these actors so young again. After all, it's not everyday that you get to see a movie with Morgan Freeman playing an action role and swinging a giant crooked sword.All in all, Robin Hood may be not the best adventure film of all time. But its flaws are not unique to it, they are pertinent to the way filmmaking was back then. So while the current generation will hardly rave about it, it'll never lose its appeal and historical value as one of the most notable adventure movies of the late 80's and early 90's. So, if you haven't watched it yet - give this film a try. Maybe you won't fall in love with it, but a certain degree of enjoyment is guaranteed."
19,"This film proved inadvertedly funny through basic improbabilities, eg the whole Morgan Freeman role, Robin riding from Dover to Nottingham in a day, and managing to get ambushed en route at what is obviously Hadrian's wall. The UK half of the cast respond by sending up the whole thing on a grand scale, with Alan Rickman outstaging Kevin Costner so greatly that you actually hope the Sheriff will win for once.The result is a funny film, but not the one Kevin Costner intended. See only if you are keen on Alan Rickman."
20,"The only reason that I put a  question mark at the end of my title is that I have not yet had the courage to sit through Waterworld or Postman. There are redeeming elements to this film:the fine performance by Brian Blessed, the cameo performance by Sean Connnery, a droll, if all too anachronistic performance by Morgan Freeman, and of course, the astonishing performance by Alan Rickman as Wile E. Coyote, a.k.a the Sheriff of Nottingham.However, there is one problem with this film.( OK, the clunky battle sequences and unimaginative set design also count as problematic).I refer to the black hole at its center, the self-righteous,pompous, utterly lifeless performance by the entity called Costner.Am I wrong, or did he not make his screen debut as a corpse? Never was there more perfect casting.Costner turns Robin into a ""Robin of Malibu"", spouting  cliches about ""freedom"" in a sort of ""californiaese"".I cannot begin to express the extent of my rage at this performance, so utterly banal, so utterly insipid. Please, Kevin, quit acting and run  for The senate from California!There, at least, you will do far less harm to American culture."
21,"Avoid this and go straight to the 1938 Adventures of Robin Hood. If you can't find that go to the 1922 Robin Hood starring Douglas Fairbanks.There is only one reason to watch this film and that is Alan Rickman as the scenery chewing Sheriff ""I'll upstage everyone"" of Nottingham. He is also the only reason I am not giving this film one star.I've seen wooden dolls with a wider range of expression and more charisma than what Kevin Costner puts on display here. Adding a crusader element to Robin's story does nothing to advance the story. Morgan Freeman does a good job as the completely apocryphal Moor in England, but is only really asked to dispense sage advice and look noble. Hint to the screenwriters - Robin Hood is a classic legend, you should be picking which bits to leave out, not stuffing new things into it.All the other actors in the film had about as much impact as blancmange."
22,"(Contains one very mild spoiler.) This is a very difficult film to rate. Essentialy because it feels as if you are watching two different films.The first stars Alan Rickman. It is brilliant, its funny, entertaining and captivating, mainly due to Alan Rickman himself.The second is terrible. It involves Kevin Costner trampling all over one of the best loved characters of British folk lore. He comes across as rather lame overall, lacking the strength and emotional resonance that Robin Hood should have.As much as I love siding with the antagonist as Alan Rickman often entices us to do, it simply shouldn't be that way in a Robin Hood film. Kevin Costner as Robin Hood comes across poorly on his own let alone juxtaposed with such a strong performance from Alan Rickman.No Robin Hood film should ever be a film where you want the Sheriff of Nottingham to stab Robin Hood to death, preferably as Alan Rickman suggests with a spoon. Yet it is.So yes, if you want to watch Alan Rickman in a great performance do watch this film. It is worth it in that respect. Just be prepared to put up with a poor performance from Kevin Costner.This is not a good Robin Hood film, but it is a good Alan Rickman film."
23,"The worst Robin Hood movie ever made.  Bad acting, horrible direction and an overblown script are the film's only good features.  Kevin Costner plays the same part he always (Waterworld set in old England) does at the same level of talent (none).This film provided a lot of material for ""Robin Hood, Men In Tights"" to skewer a couple years later.  In fact, don't watch Men In Tights without seeing Prince of Thieves first."
24,"1991 is about the time I was regularly going to the movies. I was old enough by that time to have a little more freedom and also be rewarded with a movie by my parents. ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" was a movie I saw in theater and it was one of the bigger production movies I saw in theater.RHPOT was exciting and action packed. It was an updated version of the Robin Hood story with some excellent special effects. The close ups of the arrows mid-flight was most novel. Robin Hood was already an established character, they only needed to make it thoroughly enjoyable on screen and that they did."
25,"This boorish, Americanized showboating of English legend is just plain embarrassing. Robin is somehow completely, unapologetically American, as is the entire mindset of this pathetic Costner vehicle. This was KC's last gasp, soon to be followed by other classics like Waterbomb, the Postman, and 3,000 Miles To Graceland...anybody even SEE those losers? The real death knell of this film lies in the obvious fact that no one connected with this film has any idea about the mythos behind it, and I suppose that extends to myopic fans who think this is such a ""great job."" It's not even a good movie; it is an exceptionally bad Robin Hood movie."
26,"Saying a Kevin Costner movie is bad is kind of like saying cheese smells. It just does.To be fair, some of his films have been quite good... ""Open Range,"" ""Field of Dreams,"" ""The Untouchables,"" ""No Way Out""...you could do worse than watch these films.But he's made far more bad films than good ones...and I think he's simply a very bad actor and films like this solidify that. It seems Costner has a huge ego and always takes on these ""epic"" revisionist or revisionist future films like ""The Postman"" and ""Waterworld"". ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" (err, I mean, ""Prince of Thieves"") is quite similar. It's a whole ""new"" spin on the Robin Hood tale. And it stinks. (Almost as bad as cheese.) The cast is otherwise pretty good. You've got Alan Rickman as a villain and that's always a plus. Sean Connery has a cameo, too.But come on, Morgan Freeman in a Robin Hood film? I hate to break the news to everybody but Robin Hood didn't have any black pals called Azeem (if he did then I apologize sincerely but since I read the book and don't recall an African emigrant being mentioned, I'm sticking to my guns).I understand they have to have blacks in the film so they don't appear to be ""racist."" I'm not racist and Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors ever but come on...would you put an Asian guy named Heroshima in a film about George Washington and the Revolution? Would you have him become George's best buddy and offer insightful advice? NO! Somehow I just find this film to be quite dull and plodding and over-long. Political correctness aside (and trust me, there's plenty) it's simply LIFELESS...ironically appropriate given that Kevin Costner's voice never fails to put me to sleep.Overall you could do much better - go watch the original Michael Curtiz version (one of the greatest ever and certainly the best Robin Hood film adaptation), the Disney cartoon (aw come on it's entertaining) or the Mel Brooks version. Combined together they're all better than this - which is saying a lot considering Brooks' ""Men in Tights"" was a bad film to begin with."
27,"I remember when ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES came out, I had extremely high hopes for it. The promotional stills and interviews looked promising, and I was expecting a high-spirited romp on par with Errol Flynn's celebrated film. Boy, was I in for a letdown.The movie starts off thrillingly, with Michael Kamen's spectacular score playing over medieval illustrations. But as soon as the opening credits end, the film shows its true colors¬Öa dark, dank, gore-laden bore. Seriously, what Robin Hood movie worth its salt starts with a dismemberment scene? I couldn't even look at the screen for this sequence. Alas, it was only the beginning. We're later treated to a close-up of Robin slitting his hand open (and blood seeping thru his fingers) to swear revenge for his father, we see Will Scarlett take an arrow thru the hand, we see the Sheriff of Nottingham's witch slice her arm open and spit into her blood to make a prediction, we see a blood-filled egg cracked open in another scene, we see the Sheriff's face getting stitched up¬Öreally, how's a guy supposed to keep his popcorn down? How did this movie get away with a PG-13 rating? This is R-level stuff all the way. Of course, the movie's lack of color and light doesn't help much. I don't mind them foregoing the tights for this go-round, but why isn't Robin Hood wearing his signature Lincoln green? Why isn't Will Scarlett at least wearing SOMETHING red? Everybody's wearing browns and blacks, which makes the film monochromatic and dull. Sherwood Forest looks dirty and gloomy instead of inviting and exciting. The sets are so dark and shadowy that it's a miracle anyone can see where they're going. I'm sure John Graysmark and John Bloomfield did their best with the sets and costumes, but they would have been better served had they been colorful and well-lit. And the plot takes too much of the spirit out of the legend. Robin's such a sullen gloomy Gus that it's impossible to imagine the Merry Men taking him in, much less letting him lead them. Friar Tuck's reduced to a potbellied wimp (what happened to the swordsman who was more lethal than he looked?). Azeem, while a good character in his own right, really doesn't belong in the Robin Hood mythos. (He would have made a fine stand-alone character, though.) The witch has no business being in this film at all. And what purpose does it serve to make Will Scarlett Robin's traitorous half-brother? Director Kevin Reynolds tries to guide the movie with a swift and steady hand, but the film is such a dismal mess that he ultimately can't hold it together. It's so ponderous and serious that there's no sense of fun to be had. And hearing Kamen's glorious score accompanying the film makes the experience even worse. That music deserved to be in a much better movie, and it possesses the fun, exciting spirit that the movie itself utterly lacks.And then there's the acting. You couldn't find a better Sheriff of Nottingham than Alan Rickman, and he literally steals the show. But that's not too hard when everyone else stinks. Morgan Freeman does his best with Azeem, but again, this character doesn't belong in the saga. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio doesn't have any spark as Marian, nor is she really beautiful enough to play the part (Olivia DeHavilland she ain't). Christian Slater can't make heads or tails of the tarnished Will. Brian Blessed is wasted as Robin's doomed dad, as is Michael Wincott as Guy of Gisbourne. Sean Connery's cameo as King Richard is fun, but pointless. The supporting players are so dull they aren't even worth mentioning. And Kevin Costner¬Ögreat actor, but a LOUSY Robin Hood. He has neither the presence or the attitude this character requires, and he's always talking in a droning monotone. In no way does he come off as an inspiring leader; he's more apt to put you to sleep. Nor does he have the physicality the role demands. I haven't seen a Robin Hood this inept since Barrie Ingham in A CHALLENGE FOR ROBIN HOOD. Yeah, Costner gets in a few good shots with an arrow, but when Robin thoroughly sucks at swordplay and can't even take the Sheriff without help from Azeem, you know the filmmakers have screwed up. Robin Hood's supposed to be the last dude on the planet you want to mess with, not a graceless klutz. Errol Flynn would have trashed the Sheriff and his witch with both hands tied behind his back. Heck, even Cary Elwes' MEN IN TIGHTS incarnation and Disney's cartoon fox Robin would have made short work of them. This Robin¬Öwell, had he been killed at the end of the movie, I doubt anyone would have really cared. He's hardly the sort of guy you want to root for.Call me old-fashioned, but I don't like my swashbuckler epics to be gory, dark, and dismal exercises in tedium. I like them bright, colorful, exuberant, and fun¬Öwith a minimum of bloodletting. THE MASK OF ZORRO is a case in point, as are THE PRINCESS BRIDE, LORD OF THE RINGS and PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN. Compared to those films, PRINCE OF THIEVES falls horribly short. Compared to the Errol Flynn classic it so wants to topple, it's an even bigger failure. Maybe some day there'll be a good, modern Robin Hood movie that measures up to the Flynn version and truly revives the legend for a new generation. But for now, this film ain't it. Stick with the Flynn version."
28,"Compare this story to Errol Flynn's Adventures Of Robin Hood and you see just liberal the movies became in the modern era. Once again, we see filmmakers with their heavy-hatred of Christianity showing again. In this PC version of ""Hood,"" the Christian character is shown as the hypocrite, the cross being the sign of it while the Muslim is shown as the good guy, a wonderful example of goodness plus he has all the right answers. Who better to play the wise, calm intelligent alternative-to-Christian but Morgan Freeman as ""Aziz."" Funny, but I don't recall a Muslim in Robin Hood's band of merry men. Only in Hollywood where bigotry reigns supreme! Friar Tuck, of course, is seen as not only a drunk but a liar and a violent man. Each time he does something wrong, the camera zooms in on his cross!! Wow, what subtly.Kevin Costner, meanwhile, plays a much better baseball player or cowboy than he does a Robin Hood. His voice simply doesn't give him a presence of leadership deserving of a Robin Hood.On the plus side, the movie had some lush English scenery that was great to ogle. However, you can get that in the Flynn version, too."
29,"I am having some trouble fathoming others' positive opinions of this movie. I disagree with almost everything being said about it.The movie was not historically accurate, as many claim.  I could cite numerous anachronisms, but the two most glaring were Azeem's spyglass (yes, the Moslem culture was more scientifically advanced than Western Europe, having absorbed some of the science of the Christian East which they conquered, but the spyglass was not among their achieevments), and the ""Celts"" called in by the Sheriff of Nottingham for the invasion of the settlement in the forest. (The term ""Celt"" would have been unknown to the Sheriff, and Celts of that appearance were almost 1000 years out of date.)The acting was indeed superb, but with one fatal exception.  It is absolutely vital in a Robin Hood movie that the title role be played by an actor capable of handling it.  It was quite beyond Kevin Costner.  Robin Hood needs to be bigger than life, a hero, able to project a personality that one could believe able to inspire enthusiastic support and unquestioned loyalty.  Costner managed none of these things.  I'm not talking about the accent - see Kenneth Branagh's ""Much Ado About Nothing"" to see varying accents handled properly.  I'm talking about a low-key, self effacing portrayal of a character that ought to be writ large.  It spoiled a fine effort by an otherwise splendid cast.The script contained other stupidities, which I lack the time and space to describe now.  For a corrective, I recommend the contemporaneous Robin Hood movie starring Patrick Bergin and Uma Thurmann, available on video in the US."
30,"You know, this film actually managed to be a lot funnier than ""Men in Tights"", in fact it succeeds on this level to such an extent that it is hard to imagine this was not what the director was aiming for.Forget the horrific accents from Wyatt Hood and Willie the kid, forget the amusing stunt butt, forget the geographical inaccuracies.Let's have a look at the more non-intentionally amusing parts of the film that genuinely make me laugh uncontrollably.Spoilers! (As if you haven't seen it already...)1) When Robin (wearing stock beard #15) and pal escape from the Turkish prison, they do so by lifting a patterned metal manhole cover that would not be out of place in NY (No doubt with ""the pj's"" inscribed on it)2) The Ewok village in Endor (Sorry - Sherwood) forest. Perhaps Reynolds got a good deal from Lucas? In an unrealistic film at best, this is a little bit too much. It does give Kev a chance to fufil his tarzan fantasies however :)3) The oh-so-hammy script that Alan Rickman was given (he seems to have had some fun with it, though!) Pointing at servant wench ""You - my room - ten o'clock"" Pointing at another ""You - 10:30"" *Pause* ""Bring a friend""4) The awful action sequences no doubt covering the filmcrew with splinters. An attempt should have been made to try and make this exciting?5) The BowCam (tm) - Very funny, almost as funny as the KnifeCam from Naturally pretentious Killers.6) The witch - pastiche ahoy, replete with borrowed ""MacBeth"" costume and wig.Both Kev and Christian were completely awful in this film. The only people to salvage some dignity from this steaming pile are Morgan Freeman, Brian Blessed and Nick Bramble."
31,"So the 1980's spawned lots of big movies about famous but legendary characters from Medieval times.Did the people, especially the men in Robin Hood's time have ""Mullet"" haircuts? Kevin Costner has a ""mullet"" haircut, the Sheriff of Nottingham has one, what rubbish! Maybe Duran Duran influenced Robin Hood's hair stylist? Did American accents exist in Medieval times? Seems like Kevin Costner just couldn't shake off his American twang for this heap of dung of a film.Another example of America re-writing the history books such as the submarine film where it was a British capture of a German U boat, only to be rewriiten as US forced who captured the submarine and to boot they also take the credit for finding the Enigma machine, which was actually captured by the British and taken to England's Bletchley Park where British code breakers cracked the code. NOT America! ARROGANCE!A black man as a friend of Robin? Surely the slave trade and the following freedom of black people came 100's of years later! Politically correct I assume to put a black character in, but all I felt is that it was a token gesture. I am all for black characters in films, but if a film is to be taken seriously as an account of a mythical legend, then more attention to detail should be followed.I died laughing this evening, thank God I didn't go to the movies to watch this rubbish. D"
32,"It's not so much that Kevin Costner lacks an English accent: it's that he HAS an American accent.  A PARTICULAR American accent.  I don't care if that's the way everyone spoke back in the twelfth century; in the context of this film, it sounds as if someone has wandered off the west coast of the United States wearing sunglasses.  I admit there COULD have been artistic justification, but there isn't.Shall we play spot-the-anachronism?  It's all too easy, but I'll start with a less obvious one: the longbow.  The longbow was a powerful, advanced weapon that everyone has associated with Robin Hood since the legend became a legend, but it hadn't been invented that century.  That's okay.  If it's part of the legend, it's part of the legend; but I resent inflation taking hold.  Azeem (a Moor, who has no business here) has somehow got hold of the secret of gunpowder off the Chinese.  He even knows how to synthesise the stuff from materials lying around in England.  He carries a telescope as good as anything Galileo would come up with in the SIXTEENTH century.  What next?  An Aztec who can make methane-powered generators out of old drainpipes?  The twelfth-century Indian inventor of silver nitrate photography?  Besides, Azeem's inventions come across as clumsy plot devices.  How will we get the heroes out of THIS pickle?  I know!  New technology!The `arrow-cam' shot is ludicrous, Azeem's `you saved my life, now I am your servant' schtick belongs in a sitcom, Alan Rickman's sheriff is possibly the hammiest villain I've seen in my life, the geography of Nottingham Forest is anyone's guess (it becomes Nottingham Field when the plot requires) - and, as a general verdict, most items of Robin Hood mythology are still there, but twisted ALMOST beyond recognition, into something hideous.  Really, there's no one, overall fault; but I deeply loathe the whole.  And I'm no purist.  The OTHER `Robin Hood' released that year (outside America at, any rate), with Patrick Bergin in the title role, was even further removed from the world of Merrie Olde England, but I liked its honesty and consistency. There's no doubt that it was the better film.P.S.:  This film started the trend of playing a modern pop song over the end credits of any film at all, regardless of its mood or musical score.  It's a trend to be deplored."
33,"...is what a commercial advertising the 1938 version of Robin Hood had to say in the summer of 1991 regarding the advertisement for this film claiming ""This summer Kevin Costner is Robin Hood"". The voice of the pronouncement was from the actor that defined the role of Robin Hood and the role of the swashbuckler in general - Errol Flynn.Not only does Kevin Costner not sound like Robin Hood, he doesn't act like him either. His performance doesn't even come close to that of Flynn. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is good enough in her performance as Marian, but still you can't compare the chemistry between Errol Flynn and Olivia De Haviland to whatever is there between 1991's Marian and Robin. Do note that this version does show more of the tragedy that befalls the peasants than was present in the 1938 version. This emphasis on tragedy and drama is probably there to offset the fact that since Kevin Costner can't even begin to swash Errol Flynn's buckle, and comes across more like a social worker who is good at archery, the film had to take the emphasis off of the great fun and energy of Robin Hood himself.The one saving grace of this film is Alan Rickman as the Sheriff of Nottingham. His use of the black arts is shown openly as was not possible in the 1938 version, demonstrating the true evil measure of the man, and at the same time he gets off some great comic one liners and manages to steal the picture. Claude Raines, who played Prince John in the 1938 version, would have been proud of this performance.If you want to see an intentionally comic rendition of Robin Hood, see Mel Brooks' ""Robin Hood Men in Tights"". That movie succeeded at least partially by playing off some of the ludicrous aspects of this one."
34,"This version of Robin Hood is extremely weak and horribly miscast. Most new movies (especially the remakes) fail to meet the mark....this is no exception. The story strays from the traditional legends of Robin Hood and It is a classic example of how not to remake a film. I was so bored, I almost feel asleep. Kevin Costner, the monotone Southern American, is just about as far from Robin Hood as you can get. Whose idea was it to pick him for the lead anyway? If you want to see Costner, watch Field of Dreams, which was a good flick. Stick with Errol Flynn when it comes to Robin Hood. Nothing comes close to beating that version. There's a reason the 30s and 40s were Hollywood's glory years. Just look at the quality!"
35,"The great legend reduced to a Disneyesque cartoon except without the humor or charm.  Plenty of politically correctness, examples: the addition of the wise `Moor' character, Kevin showing off his butt again, the barbaric Celt army (in the 13th century?). Costner's  bad acting was only matched by the lame dialogue.  See `Robin Hood: Men in tights' instead for a more serious and entertaining rendition of the story.  As the Moor said `Allah be merciful!'"
36,"I don't really like Keven Costner but I like him a far sight better than I do Russel Crowe, and while his movies do tend towards the ""revisionist"" style, there is something to be said for this version of Robin Hood. I will freely admit the Errol Flynn version is superior in story but this movie has style where it may lack substance.Apparently, Kevin Costner does not know how to pull off a character with such depth and range as Robin Hood. Whether he lacks the ability to interpret the character or just lacks as an actor I have never cared enough to determine but his failings are upheld widely by the team of Alan Rickman and Michael Wincott who absolutely steal the show.This is not to say that this version of the story is without merit. It is worth seeing if only for Morgan Freeman, Wincott, and Rickman. And I'll guarantee you that this version will absolutely SHINE in comparison to Crowe's Nottingham (due out 2010). Honestly, the only actor MORE wrong for Robin Hood than Kevin Costner is Russell Crowe. Oy.All in all? This is dark and sweeping. It is fun and entertaining and I LIKE IT! It rates a 6.8/10 from...the Fiend :."
37,"Okay.  The accent or lack thereof doesn't bother me in the least.  But come on...an American playing Robin Hood?  Sort of like a Brit playing Davy Crockett, methinks.A lot of people like to go on and on about how this is a great version of the Robin Hood story because it's ""realistic"" (which is a ludicrous statement in its own right, but beside the point).  It's myth, people!  Who wants realism in mythology?  Do we need ""Jason and the Argonauts"" to be realistic?  ""A Robin Hood without tights or feathers,"" they say.  That's exactly the problem!Give me the gaudy technicolor dream-world of Errol Flynn's Robin Hood any day!  Flynn actually has the spirit and exuberance that's traditionally associated with Robin Hood.  Basil Rathbone can be a hammy, scenery-chewing villain without seeming out of place, because it fits the spirit of the movie.  Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham is the only bit of ""Prince of Thieves"" with any life or color at all, which serves only to make him stick out like a sore thumb.Belive me, the Errol Flynn version is the way to go."
38,"One of my all-time favorite films!! I was four when this film came out in theaters, and when it came out on Video, my mom instantly bought it.If it wasn't for my mom, I wouldn't have a strong passion for this film. Still today, it is one of my favorites. Kevin Costner at his best I say. The acting, scenery, script, plot, and right down to the fighting was brilliantly thought out. I give it a 10/10.Here's how it goes, basically. It's another Robin Hood movie, but the best there has ever been. You have Robin of Locksley fighting with the Crusades sent out by King Richard. He is caught, nearly gets his hand sliced off but escapes and brings a prisoner with him; though he tried to rescue the rest of the men. As him and this man escape back to England, Robin discovers that his father has been murdered, and Duncan, his fathers assistants, eyes have been cut out. To prevent myself from spoiling the rest of this terrific film I'll leave it up to you to watch. This movie has a good dose of humor, action and romance. And a bit of Christian history. Watch learn and love. You can't get too much of this good thing!"
39,"hey guys! I'm a student and i have an assignment to do for the university: it is named the film project. i chose robin hood - prince of thieves as my assignment, so i had to watch it over and over again... you know what? i never get tired of it! it is brilliant, it is easy watching, but it is also a little masterpiece! only Kevin Costner could act with American accent as robin hood (who is English) and, after all, being convincing and absolutely perfect! or Azeem, a gorgeous Morgan freeman, who cares he's too modern, he's great anyway. in other words, the whole film work! whats the matter so? any anachronism? which movie doesn't have any anachronism? Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (beautiful and excellent ) has got the make up? who cares! the movie is fantastic anyway....I'm gonna challenge anyone who says the opposite!"
40,"Of all the people that you could choose to play Robin Hood in a potential Hollywood blockbuster, why choose Kevin Costner? The man has nothing more to offer than a well-known face to slap onto the billboards, and possibly a bit of sex appeal for all the 40-somethings out there.It felt like the character of Robin Hood was being compromised in order to not strain the already-limited acting skills of Kevin Costner. The man does not even make an attempt at a British accent which, among other things, is an absolute must when playing the role of a famed British outlaw. Said other things include charisma, some sort of dry wit (at least a little playful sarcasm every now and then), and an honest, believable affection for the Maid Marian.The relationship between Robin and Marian seems, to quote the great Roger Ebert, ""inspired more by necessity than by desire, as if both of them had read the book and knew they were required to fall in love."" Give Kevin Costner a bow and arrow and disguise him in leafy attire, and he still has the same detached indifference, impossible to have any feelings for (and that goes for both the audience and co-stars).But this movie wouldn't work even if it wasn't for Costner. Robin Hood's excitable band of accomplices construct the most wondrous tree forts that it's remarkable that they choose to even waste their time giving to the poor. Anybody remember the three-story beach house in The Blue Lagoon? If that was a perfect 10, architecturally, then Robin's deciduous village is a 9. It's fun to look at, yes, but it's so far off from the dark, brooding atmosphere of the rest of the film that it becomes distracting.Alan Rickman plays the Sheriff of Nottingham as if he's drunk and acting to save his life all at the same time. It's no wonder that Mel Brooks had such fun with the Sheriff of Rottingham. Rickman is completely absurd, driven crazy by Robin's elusiveness, but it's obvious that he's having fun and ultimately, it works really well.Sean Connery is fun for the last 30 seconds as King Richard, and Morgan Freeman acts well in the role of level-headed, yet slick Azeem. But I couldn't help being distracted by the fact that it was Morgan Freeman. Maybe a lesser-known actor could have done more with the role without being tied down by the fear of being embarrassed on the big screen.I feel like I should mention the action sequences before I hang up the keyboard for the night. There were depressingly few, considering it was billed as an action/adventure. But the ones that there are (specifically Robin's men vs. the Sheriff's men in the forest) focus way too much on the gore, and not enough on the flashy, stylish fighting skills that we know Robin's men must have acquired while living in the woods. I mean, what else was there to do besides practice fighting? Collect firewood, maybe.And that's that. The movie is passable, but the legend of Robin Hood is a better story than this film lets on. Costner is the biggest, but certainly not the only flaw. A mediocre script and messy directing plague the project from the beginning."
41,"Hi there. Huge Alan Rickman fan here. Watched purely for him. And he definitely delivered. BUT! this movie is actually still really good apart from him. Morgan Freeman's character is really good and inspiring and Little John, Will Scarlett, and Friar Tuck are all pretty decent. My biggest complaint is the casting of Robin. Where is his British accent?? But otherwise, good movie, would recommend."
42,"Today makes the 29 year anniversary of Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves being released, 14th June 1991.The story as we all know is based on the English folk tale of Robin Hood, that originated in the 12th Century.
The Third Crusade is well and truly underway, and Richard the Lionheart, England's King away in France. With Richard away, Sheriff Of Nottingham (played by Alan Rickman) seizes on the opportunity to rule the land. He is accompanied in doing this by his cousin Guy Of Gisbourne (played by Michael Wincott), and a witch, by the name Mortianna (played by Geraldine McEwan). Robin Of Locksley (played by Kevin Costner), has gone off to fight in the crusade, leaving his father Lord Locksley (played by Brian Blessed), at home at Locksley Castle. Nottingham has been trying to gain the support of Robin's father, but being a true supporter of Richard, will not support Nottingham's claim to the country. This brings on an attack on Locksley Castle by Nottingham's men and the staff and Lord Locksley are killed and the Locksley Castle destroyed.
Meanwhile over in Jerusalem, Robin and his comrade Peter Dubois have been captured, and are being held in a prison. They manage to break free from Ayyubid prison guards and help to save the life of a Moor called Azeem Edin Bashir Al Bakir (played by Morgan Freeman). In the escape, Peter is badly wounded, but sacrifices his life so Robin can escape, after getting Robin to swear to protect his sister Marian (played by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio).
Robin manages to make his return to English shores, he is accompanied by Azeem. Azeem has promised Robin that he must repay the debt, the debt of life for Robin's actions in the prison, where he most certainly saved Azeem's. When Robin returns to his home to Locksley Castle, he finds that the castle is in ruins, and his father dead. He is told of the attack by Nottingham's men by Duncan (played Walter Sparrow), his father's servant. Duncan has had his eyes taken in the attack, but tells Robin everything. Robin then goes in search of Marian to tell her of Peter's demise. While with Marian, the Sheriff's forces turn up, making Robin flee, he flees to Sherwood Forest where he encounters a band of outlaws led by John Little (played by Nick Brimble).
The movie had very mixed reviews, with Morgan Freeman and Alan Rickman being praised and Rickman winning a BAFTA for Best Actor In A Supporting Role, but the screenplay, overall movie and Kevin Costner's performance being criticised. One of the big successes to come was the theme tune written exclusive for the movie, (Everything I Do) I Do It For You was performed by Bryan Adams. It was a massive success throughout the World and topped most charts, in the UK staying at number 1 for a record 16 weeks.
I liked this movie and i think that the criticism is very harsh, yes i can see why the performances of Alan Rickman and Morgan Freeman being praised for good reason, both were excellent. I also thought that the screenplay was good, Kevin Costner was far from poor and i enjoyed it and have seen it more that a few times. I also enjoyed the role played by Christian Slater, he played Will Scarlet. If you haven't seen it at all or not for a while, then find a way to watch and give it a go. Look out for the uncredited cameo right at the end! Also just to add that the critics criticism did not stop the film grossing over $390 million worldwide and making it the second highest-grossing movie of 1991. only being beaten by Terminator 2: Judgement Day, while beating The Silence Of The Lambs, JFK and Cape Fear in the process."
43,"It is not the best version, Kevin Costner is not the fair Robin Hood but it is a just entertainment version, saved by humor, admirable for few good performances, for few eccentric characters and for the Richard Heart of Lion . And for the memories of old adaptations. It is an easy version , with few good scenes and with a great Alan Rickman. And it is just enough for see it. Twice."
44,I remember watching this movie years and years ago when it first came out. Thought it was pretty good. Just watched it again in 2020. Better than I remembered and worth watching just for the magnificent great and crazy performance by Alan Rickman. Not too bad acting that may be the really crappy accident or should I say non-existing accent of Kevin Costner. Much more enjoyable movie than I remembered it being
45,"I would have loved to give this movie a higher rating, but the fact that Kevin Costner playing a British character and not being able to speak with the appropriate accent knocked off a few stars.
This is the story we all know and love, the story of Robin Hood, the man that steals from the rich and gives to the poor, told in its own unique way. This movie is cast with some of the best actors of the time. Kevin Costner is Robin with Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio as Maid Marion.They throw in Morgan Freeman and Christian Slater for good measure. But it is the late, great Alan Rickman that steals the movie. His flair and inflections and facial expressions make this movie. His Sheriff of Nottingham is perhaps my favorite iteration of the character in all the various forms I has seen him. This is a great retelling of a classic story."
46,"How many movies from 1991 are still enjoyable? Anytime this is on, can't help but sit for a while."
47,"There are many awful movies: ""Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves"" is one of them. The story lacks quickness and suspense. The photography is shabby and bleak, with depressing effects on the audience. The action scenes are boring, confused and loaded with useless special effects. Robin Hood - Kevin Costner is clumsy and over-weigh: the comparison with Errol Flynn is dismaying! Moreover, in one scene we see Robin Hood naked, an intrinsically horrible idea. And then... the naked man is a stunt! Are we in a lunatic asylum, or what? Marian is turned in a sort of female-warrior (to gratify the feminists, I guess). And (sorry) I find her rather unattractive. For the sake of political correctness, Robin has a Muslim mate, played by Morgan Freeman. Well, Freeman is a great actor and an extremely nice guy. After all, his presence is the only non-awful side of ""Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves"", a highly non-recommended movie."
48,"Oh dear.Of all the many reviews I have done for IMDb, this is the one I most dreaded having to pen.Because to do this review, I knew I would have to re-watch the film, a film I had spent some 25 years, a quarter century, trying to erase from my memory.But a job is a job. I not only intend to review the film but also, as a public service, to warn future generations, and children of those future generations, to avoid this production at all costs.And, should you ever actually see it, possibly due to a streaming malfunction, or a sticky key on your Personal Device, please do not judge those of us from that era (the 1990s) too harshly.We meant no harm. If you ever get a chance, have a peek at the definitive work on the ""MADNESS OF CROWDS"" written by Charles Mackay in 1841. It is no specific justification for this film, clearly, but it serves well as an apology for the circumstances that spawned it.Sometimes, you see, Hollywood and the viewing public get caught up in a collective fantasy about what entertainment is ... or, in this case, is not. During these periods of madness, certain stars, good though they may be, become insanely overexposed.In the current generation, for example, it is Sam Jackson. (The man is everywhere. I swear I bought a flat screen TV from him at a mall last week.) In the 90s it was Costner. He was a yeoman actor, yes, but to think he had the chops, or the athleticism, or the grace, or the youth, or even the accent .... to play Robin Hood? PA-LEEZE! And then, sweet Mercy, there is the script. A script that should have been destroyed before anyone blessed its lines with the immortality of celluloid. A film that cannot decide if it is a comedy or an action yarn. (The ""Maid Marion Rape Scene"" at the end, replete with jokes and a musical score, could be lowest point Hollywood ever touched since the silent film era.) Great yawning periods in the script ... where nothing happens. A ""mass hanging"" scene where the laws of physics are temporarily suspended and men who have effectively been hanged have to use their arms to support their own weight while Robin figures out a plan.Frankly I could go on but this review is painful enough.As for those IMDb members, contemporaries of the original release, who indicated this was ""the best Robin Hood"" they had ever seen, all I can do is apologize on their behalf. Disco was ending. Computers were coming into modern life. Pop Tarts were considered a complete breakfast. They really were not in full control of their faculties.Have you seen the Errol Flynn version? If not, please go to the Amazon page and order it.As for this version, we must never speak of it again. Ever."
49,"Why would anyone want to cast Kevin Costner as Robin Hood? I remember Robin Hood as being a happy, cheerful thief that made you like him and root for him. Not in this version on the old story. Kevin Costner brings no Chairsma to the part except as some lame duck lost in bad script. But I am not just picking on Mr. Costner here. This whole film just plain stinks. Christian Slater really has no business being in this film as Will Scarlett and pulls off what has to be the worst English accent I have ever heard an American actor try. Even the great Morgan Freeman is useless here. Aside from the bad casting this film always seems to be shot in darkness even when it is daytime and got to the point that I either wanted the sun to come out or the film to end. I remember Robin Hood being cheerful and laughing while riding along the English countryside with the sun out.....I can't recall one moment when Kevin Costners Robin Hood smiled once. The only positive thing to say about this film was Alan Rickman's performance as the Sheriff of Nottingham but still it was not enough to save this gloomy dark version of a classic story."
50,"OK... let's forget the fact that Robin Hood seems the only Englishman in the film without an English accent. Lets forget about the fact that Morgan Freeman, despite his excellent acting and strong character, does not belong here... lets get the core of what is wrong with this adaptation of the Robin Hood tale.Where is Prince John?Without Prince John, the story simply fails to make any since. The Sheriff cannot ascend to the throne via marriage... he simply is not in line to do that. Anyone who has even the most cursory knowledge of British Royal Titles and lineages would know this. After all, the current Queen of England is married, but this does not mean that her husband is the King of England. From the Royal Family web site:""...the [Queen's] engagement to Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten was announced. The couple, who had known each other for many years, were married in Westminster Abbey on 20 November 1947. Lieutenant Mountbatten, now His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was the son of Prince Andrew of Greece and a great-great-grandson of Queen Victoria.""So we have a plan that leads nowhere; we have the key villain in a great story removed for no good reason resulting in a breakdown of the plot; we have a character that does not belong in the story added in for no great effect; and we have Kevin Costner, whom I know is capable of great acting, delivering a sub-par performance.This adds up to: bad movie.Stick with the wonderful 1938 Errol Flynn classic."
51,"ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES, in my opinion, is an excellent film adaptation of a classic tale. One of the things I liked most about it was Alan Rickman's villainous turn as the nefarious Sheriff of Nottingham. The only thing I didn't like was the blood and gore. If you ask me, it was funny when Will (Christian Slater) sang, ""There Was A Rich Man From Nottingham"" after tripping Robin (Kevin Costner). Also, I though that the performances were top-notch, the casting was terrific, and the scenery was beautiful. Oh, and I also love Bryan Adams' song that plays at the end. It's called ""Everything I Do (I Do It For You)."" In conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent film adaptation of a classic tale to all you Kevin Costner fans who have not seen it."
52,I watched the DVd of this yesterday and it's unintentionally hillarious. Costner is pretty average in the film although he's not helped by a dreadful script. Poor Morgan Freeman has to also suffer the indignity of reading from the purile script.The writer's have done away with the charm and daring of the Robin Hood character and turned it into a battle/pause/battle film.Rickman is superb although I'm not sure how he got away with his OTT performance - it verges on a panto villan.
53,"This was the very first Kevin Costner movie I went to see at the theater. I'd watched the Oscars that March in 1991 and saw all the Oscars that beautiful Dances With Wolves won, and I had always loved the story of Robin Hood as a kid.  I had the best time with this movie.  It was adventurous, funny, sad in places, and just a good time to escape for an afternoon. That's what this movie is, a great way to escape from everyday drudgery. Kevin was a great Robin Hood. Not too many people realize that the dialect coach was fired by the stupid director Reynolds.  There wasn't time to go in and redub the accent.  Plus, Kevin was still promoting Dances With Wolves. The guy was tired, so he should be given some slack.  He did his own stunts and everything.  It's a sensational picture and he's rockin' Robin!"
54,"I thought it was an excellent movie.  One of my favorites!!
Of course Kevin Costner is so yummy! He could be the only character and I would still love it! Also Mary Elizabeth did a good job as Marian. I thought both of them put alot of emotion into their roles and they had GREAT chemistry! I loved watching Marian go from wary of Robin Hood to realizing he wasn't ""stealing all the gold and jewels for himself"". You could just see the love on the screen! Of course Alan Rickman made a super bad guy. And who can not like the Bryan Adams song? Perfect addition to this movie! All in all a great cast and a great twist on an old story!"
55,"For a movie about Robin Hood, PRINCE OF THIEVES is surprisingly without any fun. Most of the time, it's kind of a drag. A really long one. I realize it's unfair to compare this to THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, although it speaks to Errol Flynn's impact. Costner's all staid nobility, at home when he's vowing revenge. All of the flair belongs to Rickman as he gobbles up the scenery. There's some fun to be had when the hero's slinging arrows, but those jolts are few and far between.What's really disappointing is that this movie had a hand in THE ROCKETEER's bombing. What was it, the awful Bryan Adams song? I used to watch this as a kid, but I didn't expect a rewatch to be so flavorless. At its worst, it's hammy, blah at best. 5/10"
56,"""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" is different than other adaptations of the Robin Hood legend. It includes a lot of gloomier scenes and content inappropriate for children. I found this suitable for the film and an interesting change from other Robin Hood adaptations. The costumes matched this setting and were becoming and realistic.The filmmakers deviate a lot from the history and traditional elements of other Robin Hood stories. The story is a mix of clich√© elements of Robin Hood tales and deviations from the formula. The traditional archery contest of many Robin Hood stories left out. There is no Prince John attempting to usurp King Richard's throne, only the Sheriff of Nottingham. The film delves into fantasy with the inclusion of a sorceress to aid the sheriff. Robin has a Moorish companion with a penchant for inventing items well ahead of their time. Overall these additions make for an interesting story, although I don't think the inclusion of the sorceress was necessary. The film keeps a solid pace and has a number of notable scenes, such as the sequence with the Celts and the aftermath.Much criticism has been levelled at Kevin Costner's portrayal of Robin of Locksley. He is low key, particularly when compared to Errol Flynn, but I was satisfied with his performance. It did not bother me that he didn't attempt an English accent for the role. Morgan Freeman is a welcome addition to the film as Robin's Moorish companion Azeem. Freeman injects an appropriate balance of thoughtfulness and humor into the character. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio gave a spirited and intelligent performance as Maid Marian. Christian Slater plays a bitter version of Will Scarlett to good effect. Nick Brimble was a perfect Little John and Michael McShane was amusing as Friar Tuck. Sean Connery has a memorable cameo as King Richard.The villains are led by the Sheriff of Nottingham, played by Alan Rickman. Rickman gives a great over-the-top performance as a bitterly humorous sheriff. Some people say the fact that Costner played a serious Robin Hood while Rickman played a humorous sheriff gave the film a disjointed feel, but I enjoyed the contrast. Michael Wincott is appropriately conniving as the sheriff's cousin, Sir Guy of Gisborne. With these characters and the film's story, I found ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" to be an interesting adaptation of the legend of Robin Hood and worth seeing."
57,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** This 1991 adaptation of the well-known Robin Hood legend may not be the most realistic but it offers some entertainment. But Kevin Costner was totally wrong for the part of Robin, I'm not saying he's a bad actor but he just makes Robin, who is the hero of the  film, boring and dull.                                      Christian Slater was totally unnecessary, telling Robin that he's his half-brother is what the scriptwriters might have added to make the story more interesting but the whole scene doesn't really fit the flow of the story. Alan Rickman on the other hand is simply fantastic! He steals the whole movie and many of his scenes were deleted from the movie but he's still the most interesting character! He is simply and truly one of the greatest actors of all time. Actually, I was pretty upset when the Sherrif dies, it was like ending the whole film. Many of the films memorable lines come from his character, the mean Sheriff, such as: ""Locksley! I'll cut your heart out with a SPOON!"" Pure magic. Great voice, too.(If you like Alan Rickman in this, you better watch ""Sense and Sensibility"", 1995. Excellent movie). Morgan Freeman was good too, he was very convincing as Azeem, the Moorish warrior who vows to Robin to save his life one day. I only watched this film simply for the enjoyment of watching Alan Rickman do his magic, but the movie's not really that bad. One of the good points of the movie was the music, it's fits the movie. I give movie a rating of 6/10 but 10/10 for Mr Rickman's performance."
58,"Close to the final act I realized this was a 2+ hours movie. It didn't feel like that. There's so much going on that time flies by. That is of course if you're into the movie. Otherwise it would feel like a tedious experience.The movie feels very 90s. Robin Hood takes place in the past. A past with no guns but bows and swords. The body count was still very high though. They did an excellent job of recreating Medieval times. From the rats and filthy places to the castles, woods and ancient clothes it feels very authentic and is fascinating to watch.
The reason why it feels very 90s is because the movie doesn't use the filters modern movies use. With the Robin Hood's made after this movie you can see the visuals are a bit more darker. Depending on the mood sometimes that works but other times it feels artificial and movies before the 2000s feel more real because the movie is less processed.Even though there's a high body count there's not a lot of gruesome or gory deaths. The tone of the movie isn't very dark and I liked this. The vibrant and colorful community feel was charming. There are quite a few action scenes but it's all a mix of action, comedy and drama. A lot of time is spend on Robin and the community's transformation. The evil Sheriff and co were also memorable.Overall I just thought it was entertaining story and can't really think of anything wrong with it. Maybe the best Robin Hood?"
59,"Uncut version or dont bother... the uncut makes sense of the sheriff, without it dont bother"
60,"I thought that this was the longest Robin Hood movie ever made. I then heard there's an extended version of 2010's ""Robin Hood"" that's over 150 minutes. Whatever, it's the longest version I've seen. We really do see an all star cast here with Kevin Costner, Morgan Freeman, and Alan Rickman. I keep seeing Alan Rickman in more things. It's hard to believe I never heard of him before Harry Potter.We get a lot of great action scenes but the characterizations are good. I will admit it looked a bit dim. Maybe it was just the version I was watching. It was cool to see such classic figures like Maid Marian, Little John, and Friar Tuck gradually introduced in this well paced film. I even felt we learned something about medieval times and the role of religion in that period. Not as good as the Erroll Flynn version, but still nice. ***"
61,"Thieves starts out with some good old-fashioned Arab bashing as middle eastern dungeon masters compete to see who can collect the most hands in Crusades era Jerusalem. Shagamuffin Robin looks on with sadness as his prison pals get handicapped. But the Hoodrat manages to escape and in a twist of fate, we get the 48 Hours/Lethal Weapon factor as white teams up with black when Robin frees Morgan Freeman's Azeem. When Robin escapes and returns home with Azeem, he discovers that all is not well in the hood. Taxes are out of control, the economy has gone bottoms up, and crime is on the rise. Rob sees that the natural solution to all this is for the crime rate to go up even more and starts to raise some merry mayhem in Naughtyham.But Hood's antics don't sit well with Alan Rickman's Sheriff. Turns out the Sheriff is a cannibal and he exclaims that he'd love nothing more than a spoonful of Robin's heart. Not only does the Sheriff wanna get all Temple o' Doom on Robin's ass, he also has a sherwoody for Robin's main squeeze, Maid Marion. And when he's not lusting after princesses, he's doing what any good politician does to gain influence. He's got his hands working the church.

That's when it's time for drastic measures and Rickman hatches the Sheriffic plan to recruit highlander hillbillies and start a good old-fashioned forest fire.
 
The adventure and thievery never stops in this movie. Robin Hood is a thief who will steal your heart ...likely by shooting an arrow at it with a string attached.You know it's true
Everything I chew
It turns into poo"
62,"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is the best adaptation of the Robin Hood of I watched , the cast is already very good , Kevin Costner does a great Robin Hood , Morgan Freeman as always look great and still have the great Alan Rickman makes a great villain , you feel anger, film photography is very good, the landscapes are good, the costumes are great, the direction is good , the action scenes are good, it's even better when you know that this movie is 1991 , the film also has a good humor, the film does not get to be so violent in battles such as the Braveheart would a movie four years later, more is understood by the fact that the release gap is great, and Braveheart has much more resources , Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is a good film, which gives to spend time watching , and still having a great cast is very funny moments. Note 7.6"
63,"I've said it before, and I'll say it again... American actors/actresses should not be speaking with a phony British accent.  There's nothing worse than Kevin Costner trying to talk like he's English. This movie sucks.. I can't go on about how bad it is.  Seeing Kevin Costner portraying Robin Hood is about as believable as Keanu Reeves playing an Englishman in Bram Stoker's Dracula. Sitting through 2 hours and watching this junk was a complete waste of my precious time.  Although I do have to say that this film has a few redeeming qualities... #1: Alan Rickman always plays a good bad guy.  #2: Sean Connery (although it's too bad that he wasn't in the movie for more than 5 seconds) and #3: The closing credits were by far the best part of this movie.
Watch this movie if you like.. but I promise you, you're not missing anything if you don't.  Your time would be more valuable if you spent all day passed out on your couch watching NASCAR than watching this crap."
64,"Robin Hood has been an often-used topic for movies, but this one is my favorite (though Men in Tights was pretty funny too). It's cultural value is pretty slim, but the entertaining rate is way up. I've seen this movie at least a dozen times, if not more, but I never get bored with it. And the most important reason for this is Alan Rickman's performance. After this I will Never be able to see him differently (but I am looking forward to the upcoming Harry Potter-movie, in which he will appear as the impopular Professor Snape). His looks and way of acting fit the character excellent. Kevin Costner, as Robin hood, has one very big gap in his character: the fact that he keeps speaking with an American accent. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against the USA, but when he's surrounded by people who do speak English, I's silly. And when even Christian Slater can adapt to the accent, Kevin Costner should be able to do the same thing. So why doesn't he? The stunts in the movie often make it look funny (remember the catapult?), and mingle that with Alan Rickman's performance and you will get more humor than expected. But you have to like it, and when you're searching for something with cultural value you should consider to rent something else (like trainspotting, for example. Or, looking for something else with Alan Rickman, try Dogma)."
65,"Since this movie came out my mother has been addicted to it. It is the only movie that she has seen over and over again. I too remember seeing it when it first came out but i was a fairly young child at the time and i couldn't appreciate it for what it was.Recently i was at a loose end and decided to pop my mothers well worn DVD into the player and sat down, glued to the TV for the two hours. Its a fantastic movie, it has everything you could possibly want in a movie. It makes you laugh, it makes you cry and get's you on the edge of your seat.The performances from this all star cast were on the whole fantastic. Kevin Costner has had some stick for not having an English accent, but really unless you are really listening for it and are in a mood to nit pick then it's not something that you will notice much. I liked the way Kevin Costner portrayed this character, he gave him many dimensions and made him so likable and you feel yourself wishing you were the maid marion!!Speaking of which, i was very impressed by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonia. I felt that she made lady marion interesting, not the wishy washy type character that is often portrayed. She is strong, independent and sassy. A women before her time.The highlight performance for me had to be Alan Rickman as the sheriff and Morgan Freeman as Azeem, i found both of these characters immensely entertaining. Alan Rickman is hilarious as the sheriff and had many fabulous one liners, and the rolling of the eyes and fantastic facial expressions makes you laugh and perhaps not hate him as much as you really should! Morgan freeman was perfect for this role, i love Morgan Freeman and have seen many of his films, this character was such a refreshing change and he played it to the full!When it all boils down to it, if your an old fashioned romantic and like to remember a time when men were really men and who would fight for what they believed in and who they loved then this is the film for you! If you watch it with an open mind and not let yourself be bothered by the few historical inaccuracies then you will love this film as much as me.Enjoy!"
66,"""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" is a great and wonderful swashbuckler. It has all the romantic adventure ingredients of the genre and delivers a cohesive narrative and adds interesting twists to the well known legend.
 I grew up watching this version alongside the timeless ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" with Errol Flynn. That's also a great movie.
 Besides staying true to the time peridod, there's a pleasant modern touch in how characters behave. Alan Rickman is fabulous as the scheming villain Sheriff of Nottingham. His performance is memorable. No one says ""I'll cut your heart out with a spoon"" as well as Rickman. Kevin Costner does a fine job as the hero even though he doesn't speak with english accent. That detail doesn't bother me. Costner's portrayal is solid and enjoyable. 
Hands down to Morgan Freeman as Azeem. This character is so cool and it's a great addition to the legend. The rest of the cast is also very satisfactory and everyone seems in the right place.
The story, the actors, the costumes, the places, the colors, the music! Everything seems to fit well and the result is a wonderful adventure movie.
Michael Kamen's music is also another strong point and helps the viewers to travel to time the period of the story.
The movie has some good values to pass to young audiences. It deals with friendship, honor, courage, injustice and righteousness.
Great movie, great adventure! 10/10"
67,"I remember back in '91, when this movie first hit theaters, it was bashed from a wide variety of circles, from its anachronisms to its accents. The only actor that got any sort of praise was Alan Rickman (Sheriff Nottingham) and some would even mark this as the start of Costner's downward spiral. What surprises me is not necessarily this reaction, but that I used to agree with it.But then I popped it back into my DVD player recently, and completely changed my perspective. If you ignore the anachronisms and the awkward American accents -- or better yet, accept them as part of the comic element to this movie -- it feels just as epic and even more thrilling than Braveheart. The acting is superb, the romance isn't forced, and the script is perfectly paced. Costner may not have the English accent but he certainly plays the hero to perfection.Give this movie another chance if you wrote it off a long time ago and just enjoy the ride."
68,"I first saw this film,not even in its entirety when I was just 12, and didn't think much of it. When I was 15, I saw it again and it became my favorite movie of all time. I'm 16 now, and watch it at least once a month. I must have the film memorized by now, but it's purely that wonderful.This version of Robin Hood features the good-hearted thief as a nobleman who has returned from the third crusade to find his father dead and the Sheriff of Nottingham after King Richard's throne while the king is away. The storyline is wonderful, suspenseful, and spellbinding. While now Kevin Costner is not looked upon with much regard, he played his part perfectly. Critics snub this movie because he doesn't have a British accent but honestly- who cares? It didn't take away from the movie and Costner's portrayal of Robin Hood was excellent. Morgan Freemen also did very well as the faithful sidekick and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio was the perfect Marian. The chemistry between her character and Costner's was very touching once romance began to surface. Alan Rickman played the role of the frightening, lustful, and evil Sheriff to a tee.Another critical note is the absence of Prince John, but honestly, I found it best that he was left out because in reality, John later got the British throne, so why insert him as the ""bad guy"" if he wins?The sets and costume are very believable- you'll feel like you're truly in in 1194! I give this movie a ten. I recommend it 100%- if you don't nitpick and you love the story of Robin Hood go see it! The ending is absolutely lovely. In my humble opinion, this is the best version of Robin Hood and a truly amazing experience to see."
69,"I can't believe this film has such a low rating! OK, so it is rather Americanised but if you look past some of the twee stuff it is a great adventure romp.The cast are generally good - OK so the characters are at times slight caricatures of themselves but it all works together without becoming ridiculous. Christian Slater as Will Scarlett has to be the highlight of the cast for me and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio makes a great Maid Marion.The director's cut is a particular treat with the extra scenes of the Sheriff and Mortiana adding to the darker side of the film and explaining some other parts of the film.This is a great fun, family film that should go down as a classic as it is great fun. Historical accuracy is not the be all and end all and this film does not take itself seriously enough for it to matter."
70,"I think Kevin Costner would be way down the list of actors I might choose to play (and direct) Robin Hood. And this movie is as good an explanation as any. Hollywood seemed to love him - though I can't imagine why. And the upshot has been that he grew to love himself. He seems to have played exactly the same role of 'repressed hero galvanised into action by circumstances' in just about every movie that featured him.Here, he takes the story of Robin Hood and - more or less - ruins it. Quite why our man should come back from the crusades and land 'oop north' at Hadrian's Wall is the first little mystery. Surely he would have crossed from France? Costner tries to be a 'serious' Robin and it just doesn't work - not with so many other outlandish characters. Morgan Freeman attempts to bring some much needed gravitas as a Moorish bloke, but spends most of his time wrestling unsuccessfully with a script that is positively asinine. Whilst Alan Rickman presents us with a Sheriff of Nottingham trapped between psychosis and superstition. It's not a character to take seriously. That thin-faced black-eyed actress with a name like a typing error on an Italian menu, and who seems to look ever more like an albino rat as she gets older, would have done better staying in Beverley Hills.There's a decent sprinkling of British character actors, not least of which is larger-than-life Brian Blessed, but there's nothing they can do to save the day.Robin Hood is a tale that's been told many times, and Erol Flynn's 'Sword Of Sherwood Forest' is as worthy a feature as any. If you haven't seen Costner's effort already; watch it to see how naff it is. Then check-out Errol Flynn and see some serious swashbuckling."
71,"I was very disappointed in this version. It was a rewritten Robin Hood. If you want to rewrite it write your own story. There are plenty of drama / adventure successes that do not claim to be the telling of a legendary story. I felt that it was too full of late 20th-centuryisms. Rather than try to recreate the atmosphere of 12th century England the writers expressed too many attitudes that belong only to the recent era. Btw, I'm not speaking of Marian's relatively liberated attitudes or the presence of a black character. But the entire flavor of the movie screamed late 20th century. This is why I'm not a fan of 30's and 40's historical dramas because they too made this mistake. But recently movies have tried for a more historical authenticity. This was not one of them."
72,"Prince of Thieves is one of the best Robin Hood films ever made, out of the countless versions of the tale of Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves seems the most ""realisitc"" of the films due to the fact that it doesn't use the evil Prince John as the main catalyst of the film and sticks to a more believable Sheriff of Nottingham rather than make it a royal conspiracy. The acting is believable (the only downside is Kevin Costner lacking a British accent!) and not overtly over the top with costumes that doesn't include tights and are more likely to be similar to the ones that where worn in that period. Overall this is a very enjoyable film that has made a decent attempt to tell a story that has been told for 800 years in one form or another (with sticking close to the source material) the story of Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves."
73,"Alan Rickman is fantastic as the Sheriff.  Morgan Freeman offers up an interesting character in Azeem.  The cast of the Merry Men and their families is wonderful.  The Sheriff's ""mother"" and his henchmen are well done.All you have to do is fast forward through all the bits with Robin Hood and you will truly enjoy this film.Costner should have walked away from this role as a service to humanity."
74,"I believe rule number one of storytelling to be, that at least for moments, the audiences disbelief should be suspended. For this to happen you would have to be a slobbering idiot. This flick is nowhere near credible, actually it is real crap, but films like these, destroy the legends and stories left to us by our history. I think I'm most sad, that it bears the name Robin Hood, because people will actually think, that there is a historical background for this mindless effect chaser.This is Hollywwod at its worst, there is more substance in porn. The voodoo-stuff added to the story, is simply horrible, but would have fitted somewhere in Lucas' Willow of maybe a cartoon. If so I would have appreciated it.However, there is a wonderful delivery of a single line: Wonderful Alan Rickman - ""I'll cut your heart out wit a spoon"". SLater is in this movie too - why do good actors do terrible, terrible films like these? Morgan Freeman plays a very incredible Moor. Thank Heavens that people have real history lessons. This forever turned me from anything associated with Kevin Costner, and for bizarre reasons, this is why you too should see this.....film."
75,"The Robin Hood character and the Tarzan character have got at least one common point: they were adapted in numerous movies until one's thirst is quenched. Their success was so enormous that cinema made myths of them. Now what to say about this new version of the famous outlaw? Well, as it is expected, the movie isn't worth Michael Curtiz's movie made in 1938 but it remains a spectacular and honorable success. This success is partly based on the actors. Sure, Kevin Costner hasn't got the greatness of Eroll Flynn but he can be dynamic, lucid and touching when it's necessary. On the other hand, the director Kevin Reynolds made the Nothingham sheriff a both proud and ridiculous man excellently built by Alan Rickman. As for Mary Elisabeth Mastrontonio, she's an ideal Mariann princess.But the qualities of this movie don't stop here. Of course, you ca judge that certain sequences are conventional like the final fight between Costner and Rickman in the church but there are several terrific action sequences, smart and often funny dialogs that enable to overpass the dramatic side of a few situations. Moreover, the movie introduces a realistic representation of the Middle Ages with its poverty and tyranny.A movie excellent enough to spend a truly good cinema time. The rating for this movie is 6.4 out 10? It's not enough..."
76,"It's all been said before: Kevin Costner's laughably bad accent. Alan Rickman chewing up the scenery. The ridiculous attempted rape scene. This was a downright awful movie that simply did not need to be made, and definitely should not waste one's time being seen.I have to cringe, retch, and laugh at the comments that claim that ""the anachronisms add to the movie."" This should have been a classic tale told with top actors using modern film techniques to enrich the setting. Instead it was an exercise in ""Ooh, we can show you the archery from the arrow's point of view"" while completely ignoring such trivia as dialog and character development.If this film had anywhere near the wit or soul of Errol Flynn's classic, it could have been one for the ages. Instead it comes off as just another Hollywood rip off trying to milk a few million bucks out of a story that is long out of copyright."
77,"If you grew up in the 90's how could you not love this film. It had everything the Robin Hood myth needed, plus Alan Rickman. Everyones great and is an entertaining watch. The music in the film is also excellent."
78,"Many movie Critics don't seem to enjoy a good movie. The production design. However i grew up watching this film. And enjoyed every bit of it. I don't rank a movie based on how many stars I give it. Great cast, Kevin Costner, Morgan Freeman ALAN RICKMAN! The filming locations are epic."
79,"Far as I'm concerned it's the best Robin hood out there.. The Story , Action Help with a good story"
80,This movie was the theme to my nineties. I watched it over and over and over until the tape got stuck in the VCR one day. Then I forgot about it until recently. I didn't appreciate the humor in this movie and really get what it was going for. It's a bit 30's swashbuckling pirate movie mixed with some pretty funny 90's type humor and a pretty decent love story. I have seen all the Robin hood's (except for one coming out this year 2018) and think it's still the best.
81,"Robin Hood: Prince of Thevies is a film which has its moment but is overall a deeply fault film and a poor retelling of the Robin Hood legend for the modern audience.In this version Robin Hood (Kevin Costner) is a soldier who was captured during the Crusades and escapes with Azeem (Morgen Freeman), a Moor. When he comes back to England he sees that the evil Sheriff of Nottingham (Alan Rickman) had killed his father and taken over his lands. Robin knows he has to go on the run to escape the Sheriff and hides in Sherwood Forest. It is there where he meets Little John and his team of thieves. After defeating Little John Robin becomes their leader and sets out to overthrow the Sheriff. The Sheriff also plans on going to war with Robin and raises taxes to pay Celtic warriors. He also plans to marry Maid Marrion, with hopes to father a son and heir.The film has some good action scenes but that's all it's got going. It suffers from average writing, lacklustre direction and some poor acting. Kevin Costner takes most of the flak because he has an American accent whilst playing an English character. Christain Slater is also a poor casting choice. Morgen Freeman is better, but his character really shouldn't have been in this film. Alan Rickman is famous for steeling the show and is in scenery-chewing mode here. There are also big errors of geography in this film, such going the long way round to Nottingham to Hearian's Wall and do it very quickly. Whether Robin Hood really existed is a matter of debate and the legends have changed a lot during its time, so I don't expect an accuracy retelling, but it does take a few too many liberties such as the use of Celts and witches. The film also doesn't know whether to be a light-hearted romp or a gritty dark adventure. Most of the time it's light-hearted, but at times it violence, the witch was a very horrible, scary character and there are moments likes a mass hanging scene including a child.I know this film has its fans, but I prefer a gritty realist approach to the film, not this version. You can watch it once and that's all you need."
82,"This movie is subtle and brilliant in many ways. Kevin Costner playing is like Julia Roberts, bad in most roles but brilliantly cast as war weary knight returning home to still have to fight against injustice and become the legend of Robin Hood.It emphasises the ignorance of times by including a Moore into the plotline. The arabs were the great travellers of the middle ages and in fact kept alive the scolarly tradition of the greeks. Words like Chemistry, Algebra and Algorithm all come from Arabic. The traded with the far east and had a range of technology that the English would not have. Certainly his superior medical knowledge is an important point. Christians were banned from studying medicine so Jews, Arabs and Pagan witches were the source of medical knowledge at that time.The movie has a great deal of adventure and fun with the ability to remind us that this is not all fun and games. These were brutal times and many people suffered (But historically not because of King John but because of King Richard who needed high taxes to wage war against Muslims)Like all good movies you need to possess something called ""Suspension of Disbelief"".Not a great movie, but certainly a good action film.  It raises ideas that while not always historically accurate but are still consistent with the truth of times.This a movie that has gotten a lot of rather ignorant criticism. One of the ones I think is funny is criticising Kevin Costner for speaking with an American Accent. I am sorry, but maybe if he was speaking Middle English or more likely French (as the noble classes did in those days) then his accent would matter. But he was speaking English. Should he speak with an Eton British accent?Then the other thing a lot of people didn't like is Sean Connery playing Richard the Lion Heart with a scottish accent (Given that King Richard was born in France, raised in France and didn't speak any English is over looked by the small brained individuals writing the reviews).Lets remember that the story of Robin Hood is political. The good King John who ruled England far more wisely than his evil brother Richard was demonised in this legend. So historical innacuracies should not even be an issue."
83,"Costner was never a great actor he was a movie star and commanded the attention as a lead actor, then there's the incomparable Alan rickman a phenomenal actor and mr Morgan Freeman 2 if the best actors ever!! Rickmans sheriff is both funny and still a tyrant villian, just like die hard he should have won an oscar!! He is sorely missed!!! This movie has comedy, action, great story, great acting, and no one ever forgets because its dull it'll hurt more!! The spoon line is remembered by all!! If you haven't seen this you're losing out 3 phenomenal near masterpieces were from 1991, terminator 2, Thelma and louise and this gem!!!!!!"
84,"Well I won't say this aged particularly well. It is a bit dated yes, but still enjoyable.A fairly standard take on the Robin Hood story. Alan Rickman was notably funny and entertaining as the villain. He had the best lines which were not even part of the original script but were improvised.Nothing too critical about the film, just a tad campy."
85,I like the bit where Sean Connery had an English Scottish and Irish accent in the space of 30 seconds
86,"It's corny, yes. But it's the good kind of corny. It's fun from start to finish. The acting is even decent, even from some of the unknown actors, though a bit corny at times, but it all fits together nicely. And Costner's accentless Robin Hood is hilarious and endearing. It makes this film all the better. Friar Tuck is great fun too. A very original vision.And there are some really great quotable lines and genuinely good bits here, namely Alan Rickman's stellar performance, which is perhaps the best of his career. It's a shame he didn't get an Oscar for it. I could watch this again and again. Recommend."
87,"Rickman, McShane and Freeman are great. Even Costner is good as Robin Hood. The story is good, there's some great action, and even the comedy moments pay off well. The whole cast is good."
88,"They keep trying to retell this story and turning it into and action special with no heart but here are three reasons whybit isbthe best. 3. Story is just fun, clever mix of humor action and drama. 2 score is phenomenal and timeless. 1 Alan Rickman performance is superb. Trying to up stage Alan Rickman is about as rural as remaking ET. Forget about it. Only he would think of an evil sheriff who could get so mad that he can't even talk right. And just entertaining alone. Morgan Kevin and just about all the others are well developed characters unique to their own. But people can't stand once in a life time experiences and always want more so they keep trying to remake it but honestly. This was the film that pushed Robin Hood into the lime light in the first place. Probably got thousands of people wanting to learn archery. And just gotta love the time when movies used to be fun and not so melodramatic."
89,This is one of my all time favorite movies. Perfect rainy day movie!
90,"No Robin Hood movie can dream of even coming close to the perfection that is 1938's The Adventures of Robin Hood, but Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves ranks as my 2nd favourite movie about the famed English outlaw. If the 1938 Robin Hood is one extreme of a bright, colourful, tight wearing, saccharine induced fantasy and the Ridley Scott Robin Hood is the opposite extreme of an unnecessarily dark, gritty and overly mature version of the tale, then Prince of Thieves is the middle ground.Is the all American Kevin Costner miscast as Robin Hood? Yes. But do I care? No, not really. Costner's enthusiasm does come through in his performance and shows he has what it takes to be an action hero. Most people won't think of Costner as a screen presence, but to me he is. Likewise, realism is beside the point with a movie like this.The movie opens unexpectedly in Jerusalem showing that this is a Robin Hood movie which does thing a bit different, largely with the character of Azeem (Morgan Freeman), a black man in medieval England. Azeem represents positive representation of an Arab as well as the Arab world. He holds more progressive views on women and in one of the movie's pivotal scenes in which he hands Robin a rudimentary telescope (very similar to a paralleling scene in Dances with Wolves) which isn't recorded to have been invented until the 17th century. However, the notion that an individual or individuals from the Arab world might have known about such technology isn't a too ""out there"" idea due to the Middle East being far more advanced society during the middle ages. I assume it's unlikely we'll see a character like Azeem in the post 911 world in which the Middle East is no longer portrayed in media as an exotic fantasy land rather than a haven for terrorists. Costner and Morgan Freeman make for a fun duo; who wouldn't want to have Morgan Freeman always by your side giving you winsomely knowledge? After all what other actor embodies dignity more than Freeman? Yes, there is a big gaping plot hole when Azeem saves Robin's life as soon as they arrive in England. But do I care? No, not really.The film's message of equality between race and gender isn't shoved down your throat and doesn't come off as overt political correctness. Likewise Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's (try saying that name three times) Lady Marian is a woman in medieval England who has a sense of self and is not subservient to anyone; not historically accurate but progressive. Plus I do love a girl in armour.However, it's Alan Rickman who steals the show as the twitchy, scenery-chewing madman that is the Sherriff of Nottingham. His performance is full of little things which feel like they were improvised and his many outbursts are music to my ears. Is it just me or do classically trained actors often make the most memorable villains? Sean Connery's appearance, on the other hand, is one of the better uses of a celebrity cameo in a film. Just like how the characters are surprised to see Richard the Lionheart we as the audience are surprised to see Sean Connery; plus he's perfect in these kinds of roles.How can that score by Michael Kamen not evoke the adventurer in you? The music is so good that it appears Disney has been using it on their own logo. Likewise, I guess I'm also the only person in the world who isn't sick to death of Bryan Adams' (Everything I Do) I Do It For You; I still jam to it now and then. Ah the days when the pop song tie-in was as big, if not bigger than the movie itself.Prince of Thieves is good old fashioned swashbuckling action. The action on display has a sense of weight and physicality with the impressive large-scale action sequences with even the out there moment with Robin and Azeem being fired over a wall with a catapult still feeling believable, and not a computer generated effect in sight; all practical glory.The movie does the English landscape justice; even in the drab winter weather, there is still a beauty to it. Prince of Thieves features some breathtaking money shots, such as that of Robin firing an arrow with an explosion behind him filmed at 300 frames per second; or perhaps my favourite shot in the film, the romantic elevator with the sun in the background splitting the trees. Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is a film with its faults but I'm so engaged with the world and it's aesthetic that I can look past them, a world in which everything feels used and lived in, one beaming with personality."
91,"Dear Sheriff of Nottingham: MARRY ME.In all seriousness, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves possesses reasons to watch all the way through. Besides what I referenced above, there is the look of the film, which feels enough like the romantic middle ages that you're content living in its environment, even if you're not interested in the plot. I barely was. Robin and Marian aren't the most dynamic couple in film history, alas. Good Lord, Costner's acting is awful. But it makes me laugh, so there's that. The screenplay is nothing to write home about either. Robin: ""What do we need that the forest cannot provide?"" Me: ""Antibiotics?"" The story focused on the wrong character. No one ever stood a chance against Mr. ""Cut your heart out with a spoon."" Rickman singlehandedly bumped my rating up to 7 with one of his best performances. The extended cut restores scenes with Rickman which were removed allegedly because Costner didn't want to be upstaged. It's entirely possible. I like Mortiana, too. Unlike with LOTR, I genuinely wish I could appreciate the whole of this film rather than the parts. If you personally do, you are not as picky as I, for which I commend you. It is good if you want to relax for two hours."
92,"I echo a lot of what the other reviews had to say. This is a well made movie. There's good sets and costumes (although Sherwood Forest looked a lot more like a Hollywood set than an English forest) and great cinematography and even some acting that wasn't too bad.What is really lacking is decent dialog. GAWD is the dialog corny. And Kevin Costner did an absolutely dreadful job throughout most of the movie. Some scenes he was passable, many he was not. Of course, given the writing and the ridiculous lines he had to deliver, it wasn't all his fault.Morgan Freeman does a good job for what he has to do - act humble and sage and then fight with invincibility - I'd guess that's not too hard. But I really don't know what his character is even doing in the show. I guess I can allow that much artistic license, but lordy, somebody should've been watching the script closer.Anyway, enjoy it for what it is, a medium-budget swashbuckler with nice backgrounds and props and very little story. It's a Saturday Matin√©e kinda flick."
93,"Robin is captured and about to be killed over the Crusades in Jerusalem when he finds a way to escape with the help of an Islamic moor and his partner, who is killed shorty after. His partner makes Robin promise to look after his sister, and the moor decides to help as well. Together the two travel to Robin's home where he learns that in the absence of the King, the Sheriff of Nottingham has been tyrannical over the people, even killing Robin's own father. Robin and his friend join up with a group of bandits, and becomes their leader. He teaches them about archery while his friend (albeit unliked by most there) teaches everyone about swordsmanship. Together they fight the rich, and anyone trying to take away their freedoms. This movie is a fun and campy adventure story. Nothing about it is well done, but that didn't stop me from enjoying it anyway. Just don't go into this movie with high expectations, and you may in fact have fun with it.Soundtrack: 5- Generic epic adventure score with no uniqueness. It was fun, but nothing made it stand out.Script: 8- Whoever wrote this script did a great job. The person wrote well, and the dialogue and story made good sense.Originality: 0- So many movies and shows have done Robin Hood. This was just another one that didn't do anything cool to the story.Cinematography: 6- The action sequences were shot well, but there were some weird close ups and strange camera angles in non-action scenes.Casting: 7- Some of the casting choices in this movie were a little weird, and didn't fit well.Acting: 3- The acting in this movie was almost comedic. There were times where I could see some actors trying, but for the most part the acting was absolute crap. Also, accents were absolutely atrocious. Sometimes it seemed the actors forgot they even had them.Overall: 4.8"
94,"This film will always hold a special nostalgic place in my heart as for a long time it was the first and only video tape our family ever owned. During boring moments we automatically put this film on and consequently my sister and I knew every single line off by heart. Despite the contrived cheesiness of the film it is a belter and sure to produce rib-busting laughter in our household. One hilarious goof that no-one has mentioned on the mistakes section is this: When Robin first comes back to Sherwood he has a sword fight with a masked figure. During this scene he gets hold of his opponent's arm and forces it into a goblet of fire, whereupon the assailant emits a feminine scream. Upon unmasking his foe he sees it is his old sweetheart Maid Marian. Now fast-forward to the end of the film and this accomplished and brave swordswoman is a screaming gibbering wreck, cowering in the corner, as Robin is chased about by the evil Sheriff! (Alan Rickman totally steals this film). Surely she could have used her clearly well-developed combat skills to join Robin against the Sheriff, thereby avoiding much drama and ruining of furniture in the process? But then that would have made for a pretty rubbish conclusion to the film wouldn't it?"
95,"This may not be the dreadful cinematic attempt that some claim, but neither is it a brilliant retelling of the legendary hero's tale. It's been quite a few years since I've seen this movie, but remember being disappointed with it at the time. For starters, the Bryan Adams' song, 'Everything I Do, I Do It For You', is lovely but a pop song is unsuitable for this film. Surely they could have found something medieval for the score.This movie tells the legendary story of Robin of Locksley, who has been captured by the Turks during the Crusades, and is now returning to England with his Moorish companion, Azeem, who vows to repay Robin for saving his life. Robin discovers that during his absence, his father has been murdered by the Sheriff of Nottingham and seeks revenge. He then takes to Sherwood Forest as the leader of an outlaw band of men whose purpose is to save the peasants from the Sheriff's evil tyranny.Kevin Costner makes an adequate, if not compelling, Robin Hood. Personally, I had no objections whatsoever to his lack of an English accent. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio plays Marian, who is not particularly sympathetic here and too much of a warrior to suit my taste. The feminists must have had some input into her character.As for Azeem...Morgan Freeman is one of my favourite actors, but I had extreme objections to the inclusion of his character in this picture. What on earth is this Moorish chap doing here? True, I realize the whole Robin Hood story isn't very historical to begin with, but Azeem is not even, to the best of my knowledge, a remote part of the legend. I basically just wanted all my old favourites... Robin, Littlejohn, Will Scarlett, Friar Tuck, Marian, and the wicked Sheriff. Some comments have pointed to political correctness, and I wonder if such might be the case. One doesn't exactly picture Moors roaming around Sherwood Forest! No offense to Freeman, whom I've loved in every other role, but I don't think he belongs in this particular legend.And where on earth is the wicked Prince John? We have a Moor here but no Prince John. Something's not quite right. Also, as another noted, Robin did not himself go to the Holy Land during the Crusades.In any case, my husband really enjoyed this movie and there's certainly lots of action adventure and derring do. However, I was looking for a more light hearted, swashbuckling, fun, and traditional rendition of the tale. This one seemed a little too dark, with characters added & others missing. A better bet is the old 1938 Errol Flynn classic or Robin and Marian, a tale of the aging Robin, starring Sean Connery & Audrey Hepburn.Do not read on if you haven't seen this movie, or the ending will definitely be spoiled for you.*** WARNING: SPOILER AHEAD ***In fact, the only memorable part of this tale for me is the cameo appearance at the end by Sean Connery as King Richard the Lionheart, newly returned from the Crusades. Connery is absolutely magnificent as Richard."
96,"This movie is one of those that could use a censoring. CUT all scenes that do NOT have Alan Rickman in them. He steals the show subtley and easily, and this evil sheriff is worth watching! The rest of the movie...take it or leave it."
97,"I know Kevin Costner took some acting classes in college but what I wonder is...did he fail?! In my opinion, and i realize it's just my opinion, he is one of the worst actors in Hollywood! He always sounds like he's rehearsing a script. I read a lot of reviews and, quite frankly,I can not understand all the good reviews this movie received. Perhaps those reviewers allowed Costner's good looks and charm sway their opinions! I suffered through 32 minutes of the movie and that was all I could take. Robin Hood is a classic...books, TV shows and movies...but something went sadly wrong with this one. Even Robin Hood:Men in Tights was far more entertaining. And dare I say, even the great Morgan Freeman was a bit off his mark in this one. The scenery was good, the direction suffered little, but the script and the acting wasn't worth 2 hrs and 23 minutes!"
98,"A sort of minor spoiler Why is it that everyone expects Will Scarlet to wear red clothes? Back in the time of robin hood scarlet was a type of material not a colour and besides red was a very expensive colour to get and only nobles would wear it, which I'm guessing is why you see Will in red at the end of the film. And why does everyone say this is a rubbish film?!?!?!? Its the best film, it only seems rubbish now because of all the effects from new films like Lord Of The Rings. I think there's only one problem with this film and thats the fact that Will Scarlet is portrayed to be so pathetic, even though Christian slater plays him really well, you just cant help but think 'what a loser'."
99,"I know this came out 22 years ago, but this still my favorite Robin Hood movie. I like this even more that the Russell Crowe movie. I think the casting of the characters was exceptional in that Kevin Costner, Christian Slater, Morgan Freeman, Alan Rickman, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio were perfect for their roles.I have several favorite parts in this movie but at the top of the list is when Azeem (Morgan Freeman) gives his speech toward the end of the movie asking all the commoners to fight for their freedom. Another favorite scene is when Robin Hood finds out he has a brother, Will Scarlett. And finally, the scene where Robin and the Sheriff fight at the end. Those are my top three favorites.Although I like him, I think the scene at the very end where King Richard ""crashes"" the wedding between Robin and Marian was an after thought especially when King Richard was played by Sean Connery. If you're going to have a huge actor in such a small roll to make it seem bigger, why choose Sean Connery.Still a great movie! Timeless!"
100,"It's difficult to know what to say about Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves. As someone who grew up steeped in Robin Hood stories (as augmented by the Richard Greene TV series, not to mention a constant stream of movies of one sort or another), it was a bit of a surprise to encounter a monster film which embraced so many contrarinesses.It drove a coach and horses through much of the impregnable Robin Hood legend, yet embraced much of it unstintingly. It had a resolutely American Robin, and a very English (though American) Marion. It had, uh, Morgan Freeman. Love him to bits, and he always brings statesmanlike majesty to what he does, but in Robin Hood? Alan Rickman's Sheriff, embracing pantomime villainy in a part which is so broadly humorous in how it is written that it belongs in another film (yet it fits so well in this one). And above all, it was a film which didn't take itself seriously for a second, with a Robin who didn't fail to take himself seriously every second.Oh, and it was hugely enjoyable."
101,"This movie strikes a very good balance between the popcorn-mainstream-pure-fun kind of film-making and a serious attempt at dramatic storytelling.On one hand, there's the adventure line - Hollywood-styled action sequences, loads of appropriate funny lines, a good amount of unreal-but-acceptable-and-still-enjoyable moments.On the other hand, there are sufficiently-deepened social and cultural topics involved: the Crusades, growing to maturity, father-son issues, brother-brother issues, other cultures (Islam), the social context of rich and poor, love...Man, you could almost recognize Karl Marx's communist ideal in the camp preparation sequence, which is very big fun. :)) Serious issues that don't go too deep, in order to keep mainstream audience from falling asleep.The humor is interwoven on many levels throughout the script. And this is tough! All of the actors give good performances.Cool and entertaining antagonists in the faces of Alan Rickman and Michael Wincott. The bishop is also haunting.""Father Tuck""¬Ö :)))) Morgan Freeman is amazing as always.Kevin Costner's accent is a problem somewhat, but it also adds to the funniness of the picture.Way to go! To give pure entertainment while including serious dramatic elements is quite a task! Way to go! I'm surely biased, cause I grew up with it but¬Ö I love this movie! If I give it anything less than 10, I would betray my childhood and I would also insult the good sense for balance in film-making.Watch it - it's quality time.10\10."
102,"This movie is my sentimental Kevin Costner favorite. It was the very first one of his I ever saw at the theater. I returned three more times to enjoy it and savor each moment with my new favorite actor. So much is critiqued and criticized about the accents or lack of them in this portrayal of the man who robbed the rich to give to the poor. That is so trivial really. You sit back for a couple of hours, are transported back to the century it took place in, and you have a great time. You cheer the hero, boo the villain just as you're supposed to. Everyone who partakes in this film is great. Some wish to constantly banter that one is better than the rest. Excuse me, that's simply your opinion. You have a right to you thoughts about it, but do not pretend to tell me how I should feel. The cinematography is outstanding. The story is fresh for a Robin Hood tale. It veers a little bit off the old standby version, but I like the way the writers took it. Kevin Costner is so handsome and dashing in this and Maid Marion beautiful. It is romantic and adventurous to the hilt. Sit and enjoy it on a rainy afternoon. Great film that has endured for all these years and for many more to come."
103,"I have kept my silence as long as I can. This movie really is a wonderful adaptation of the original story of Robin Hood. And I was so grateful and glad that my favorite actor, Kevin Costner, got to play the role. I get quite agitated with these posters whining about the accent. There are several stout arguments one could have about that. To me it hardly matters. The movie is fast-paced, fun, very lovely to look at, and I had a wild time watching it. As soon as the DVD came out, I bought it and I enjoy watching it over and over without ever getting tired of it.There are a lot of people who rave on and on and on about Alan Rickman. I'm like ""so what?"" Sure, he has funny lines. They were written for him! But he doesn't steal the show, as so many would imply. I think he does a good job, but he isn't the reason why I went to the theater to see it four times. He isn't the reason I bought the video and the DVD of it.All the characters are great in this movie. Christian Slater does an adequate job as Will Scarlet. Mary Mastroantonio is a great Lady Marion. The witch is Halloween comical but also very good. Little John and all the rest are just right in their parts. I think the most important thing about any movie is--does it hold your interest from beginning to end? Yes, is my answer, Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves does that and then some. It is excellent in every way that it should be."
104,"Some say this is the worst Robin Hood movie that has ever been made. Especially the fact that Robin speaks American instead of British English has been a major drawback for most. But who cares! This is a typical Hollywood movie. It isn't meant to be the most accurate and historic story ever told. It is meant to entertain. And it does! Kevin Costner is very charming as Robin. He is very sympathetic, witty and he doesn't look so bad either. I didn't have any problems with his American accent, but maybe that is because I was 12 or something when I first saw it and hadn't really noticed. Now I know, I still don't think it is annoying. And I think an American accent is always better than him speaking a very bad pretend British accent....That would have been really annoying. Maid Marianne and Azeem were perfectly cast in my opinion, but I have to say that Alan Rickman is the one that really carries the movie! He is just so sarcastic. A brilliant actor in every way and in every role!Then there is the story of the movie. It is packed with action, romance, adventure and humor; what more do you want....Oh, right beautiful settings, a thing this movie doesn't lack either! Top entertainment! 8/10"
105,"Kevin Reynolds is such a good director!  I really enjoyed this film a great deal.  The story is very interesting, the action is fantastic, the characters are great, the acting is well done, the costumes are very nice, the humor is perfect and the filming is excellent.The cast is very good in this film.  Kevin Costner pulls off one of his better performances (in my opinion).  I really don't care about him not having an English accent.  Can you understand what he's saying?  YES!!! Then where's the problem?  Alan Rickman plays an excellent villain as always, as well as Michael Wincott.  Those two actors play excellent villains, and you have them both in the same film!  Morgan Freeman pulls off one of his best performances and plays a very likeable character.  Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio plays an excellent love interest in the film.  Christian Slater does a very good job with his role in the film, despite being a somewhat small role.  Sean Connery has an awesome cameo in the film.  That was a nice touch!  The rest of the cast was fantastic as well.If you're looking for an action-packed Robin Hood film, then I would hope that you would enjoy this film.  I would probably recommend this film to just about anyone, so I truly hope that you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading,-Chris"
106,"It's not Errol Flynn, but it's still entertaining and Costner plays the part of the Sherwood Forest savior well, while Rickman is scene stealing as a snarling Sheriff of Nottingham."
107,"Alright, I'll come right out and say it: You need to watch Robin Hood: Men in Tights before you watch Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. It's the only way you'll enjoy it. If you watch Prince of Thieves first, you will hate it. As Cary Elwes mimics in his Mel Brooks spoof, Kevin Costner doesn't even try for a British accent as Robin Hood. Come on, it's Robin Hood! I guess Costner figured he was too cool for school and his All-American charm would convincingly coast him through a famously English character. It didn't work.Maid Marian is utterly unappealing in this version, and during the entire two and a half hour running time, I found myself rooting for Alan Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham rather than the actual ""good guy"". You will, too, trust me. Robin Hood is boring and far too lengthy, and the only good thing that came out of it was Mel Brooks's spoof. Well, that's not fair. There are two very good-looking men in the two leading roles, so at least the girls out there get some eye candy while they're being bored to tears.You will absolutely howl when you watch Men in Tights; it's obvious that while it spoofs other Robin Hood portrayals, this 1991 version was the main inspiration. Literally, there's a hilarious connection during every scene. If you take my advice and watch this movie after its spoof, you won't just howl‚Äîyou'll snort and guffaw, and probably wet your trousers. And that's the only way to go."
108,"As enjoyable and watchable as a film adaptation of the legend of Robin Hood is supposed to be made out to be, this film is woefully underdeveloped and silly! Featuring a cast, majority American, whom can't even pull off decent English accents in their featured Nottingham roles, makes this movie, it's characters and it's purpose, foolish and disturbing. The accents of Christian Slater Michael McShane aren't great and nevertheless their character development, As well as Little John's, is not great nor is their presence of any importance as it's supposed to be in the great tale of Robin Hood. Kevin Costner's performance as the titular hero also isn't great, nor is his lack of attempt to try an English accent, but instead we're invited to oversee the tale with Yankee Robin Hood instead. The only great and plausible things about Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, is the performances of Alan Rickman as the evil Sheriff of Nottingham and Morgan Freeman as Robin's sidekick Azeem. Their performances are noteworthy and excellent and give some greatness to this woefully failed tale of one of greatest known tales of all time."
109,"I found this movie to be just about the worst version of Robin Hood I have ever seen. It was on TV the other night and I'm a Robin Hood fan so I thought I'd give it a go. Little did I know what I was in for! I could barely stand to finish it. I have heard people make fun of the Errol Flynn version, but I fear this one is far worse! Not only is Kevin Costner the worst actor for this part, the supporting isn't much better. One would think that Hollywood would be able to cast someone with a British accent for the part of a Briton, or at least get their American to take voice lessons. I am very sorry but, this is a very poor adaptation of a wonderful story."
110,"Okay, so as Robin Hood, Kevin Costner cannot hold a candle to Errol Flynn. He plays the role the same way he acted in all of his films from the 1990's- kind of like Wyatt Earp in the Middle Ages. However, Costner isn't what makes the film entertaining for me. The supporting cast, especially Alan Rickman and Morgan Freeman, steal the show from Costner, the supposed star of the film. As the Sheriff, Rickman is (like always) brilliant and even better, considering his role was mainly ad- libbed. Morgan Freeman is also great in his role, and has some truly memorable lines.Aside from Costner's performance, famously spoofed by Mel Brooks, the weakest link for me is the actress who plays Marian. At times, she seems like she truly does not want to be the film at all, and would rather be anywhere else other than near Costner. Then again, she was a last minute replacement for the role, so perhaps that's why she has zero chemistry with her leading man.The action scenes are fun, though, and worth a view. If you want to see a really good Robin Hood film, though, check out Errol Flynn's version from 1938! Flynn was born to play Robin Hood. Costner... not so much."
111,"Having not yet this movie before and having only seen clips from the Bryan Adams video.Have to admit when saw it,much much better then thought it'd be.Accent and Geography aside this movie is just great .OK Conster may not have put much emotion into his role and speak sometimes in an dull and flat tone but what the hey!OK so it has it's up and downs and weak moments but the effect used or lack of them are quite surprising for the time it was made.And Alan Rickmen gave it a whole new presence.Accent and mistakes aside defiantly worth seeing!Spoiler!!And the twist with Will Scarlet ignore the fact may been an ad on all I was expected was A)either he'd try and kill him and see the wrong in his ways etc or B)end up getting killed and only then seeing how wrong it way.What happened surprised me and made it so much better.I love this film !!"
112,"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves was the -best- movie ever made,a true classic. The actors were the best,I LOVE the casting,They had put the best people in this movie,and that is the only reason it had turned out to be such a wonderful great movie. It is by far my most favorite movie of all time.I have watched it so many times I couldn't even say how many times it's been.But,if you have not seen this movie. I truly tell you it is the best,and you will love it as much as I,and other's have.I think everyone should see it,and also. I have alway's been into the mid-eval times,which is another reason I really love this movie.:)I tell anyone that hasn't seen it to go out there and buy it! Or at lest rent it. ^^ You wont regret it."
113,"Twenty minutes into the movie I knew I was not liking it. Forty minutes in it was assured with the entrance of Christian Slater's Will Scarlett. I find it fascinating that when the English are cast into American roles in American films they are forced to speak with American accents. However, when an American film is made, set in twelfth century England, the American actors cast into the lead roles speak modern American English.This is the first time I have watched a Robin Hood movie where I was actually rooting for the Sheriff of Nottingham over Robin Hood.There was far too much white fabric, especially with regard to the wedding ensembles. White fabric was virtually nonexistent until late 18th century and then it was worn by high royalty as they were the only ones who could afford it.For me, the only redemption for this movie came in the forms of Alan Rickman, Sean Connery and Geraldine McEwan who played their roles masterfully. Mr.Freeman was also very much his character. And then there were the occasional comedic antics of Michael McShane's Friar Tuck.As I told the friend who encouraged me to watch this movie, my high opinion for the acting abilities of Mr. Costner and Mr. Slater plummeted drastically in watching Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves."
114,"For some reason I've never watched this film. I guess I wasn't really a Kevin Costner fan as a kid, who is?, and I even think back then I found an American Robin Hood stupid. Alas however with an interest in Historical Adventure I decided to get round to this. What the actual hell 1991? This was your second highest grossing film?I was expecting a Hollywood movie, no doubt. I know that entails a certain amount of Americanization and commercialization. It happens in Braveheart for example but they still have a foot in some kind of reality even if they paint characters with broad strokes.But this? Everyone who isn't good is a sniveling pantomime villain, Alan Rickman is like a cinematic version of Blackadder. He is raised by a devil worshiping witch... WHAT THE FLUFF? Complete with a children's TV dungeon set that has dry ice and green lights. Why stop there guys why not just give him a dragon too?The main problem aside from the casting of Robin Hood is this is neither fish nor fowl. If they had intended to make a swash buckling adventure movie, something like Zorro, maybe some of this cheese would be over looked but every so often they try and make this some profound historical epic with Kevin spewing out some half assed noble words. Honestly the one with the cartoon fox was more believable."
115,"I have seen this rendition and I can't not only say it is one of the best. Versions of classic legend, of the thief who stole from the rich and gave to the less fortunate. He is the best looking of the Robin Hoods, Kevin Costner's performance as the legendary Prince of thieves. Was excellent , and in my opinion this was one the best movies he ever did. Morgan Freeman was also very good. As his wise and spiritual sidekick, they worked very well together as a team. The scenery was beautiful, the acting was terrific. Alan Rickman's portrayal of Robin's nemesis The Sheriff of Nottingham in certain aspects were almost comical. But on the flip side he was heartless , sadistic and cruel! In nature, but beyond the battles the heartache and betrayal. There is a lighter side to this movie , the merry men and the drunkard friar. Were quite, comical ! Yet at the end of it all the hero managed to still win the heart of the fair . Maid Marion!"
116,"What a fun film. It's a terrific adventure that has it all: romance, action, drama, humour, a fantastic soundtrack, and a great story. I remember seeing the ads for this as a kid and thinking, wow - that looks cool. And it still is.So Kevin Costner might not have an English accent, as don't many others in the film. And so there may be many factual inaccuracies. Many films have factual inaccuracies but don't make up for that by being great films to watch. This film is certainly a lot more fun and entertaining than Russell Crowe's Robin Hood, which, supposedly, was far more historically accurate.This film is a yarn - it is a Hollywood adventure that is well-filmed and, I have to say, really not too badly acted. For me, it was easy to get lost in the world the film creates, and that is one of the major things I look for in a film of this kind.One of my favourites, for sure."
117,"Robin Hood prince of Thieves is actually one of the least Hollywoodized version of a Robin Hood movie. The action seems real enough (apart the catapult one which is just) and the actors are living the part. Kevin Costner hasn't got an English accent but then,what was the accent then? At least he is a believable Robin and of course Alan Rickman is for sure,the Sheriff. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is believable also. The newest Robin Hood (2010) is too raw and it should not have copied Gladiator in the mood. Robin Hood is a legend but with a purpose: the brave action of one to help many,for a more just lifestyle. be it a legend or not,the story is uplifting and hat is positive. It has been known that such a story inspire some to protect the weaker (I did and am known for it). So,just take it for what it is: A great flick for action and some humor with uplifting music and an inspiring message that injustice must be fought against. That is it,no more but certainly...no less,right? Each time you want to feel like someone that can change the world for the better,whatever you status,watch this and be reminded that such movies are a must as a positive contribution to a good time but also a philosophic message of having compassion."
118,"Recently we tried to watch Russell Crowe in Robin Hood 2010. It was so bad with no continuity of plot or character that we followed it up with this classic fun filled adventure film. All the actors are great and the director did a fantastic job producing characters that have personality, wit, and plenty of charm. The interaction through out the film was well thought out with action, adventure, comedy and each scene had merit. The scenery, castles, and costumes were picturesque. This film is like watching a game of football you become completely engrossed in the plays. The characters were believable, fun and the story was very engaging."
119,"Great film.This man called Robin of Locksly,Kevin Costner,escapes from being tortured in Jeruselum and takes a black man with him,Azeem,Morgan Freeman,says he owes him his life.So they get back to England after 4 months and they discover that the Sheriff of Nottingham,Alan Rickman,has killed Robin's father and burnt down his castle.Nottingham is a bit of a womaniser.He ain't happy and wants to rebel against him but first he goes looking for his best friend's sister,Maid Marian,Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio,to tell her that her brother is dead.So he does that.But then he becomes an outlaw after he nicks her horses accidentally on purpose to escape Guy of Gisborne,Micheal Wincott,the sheriffs cousin.He escapes to the forest and starts living with outlaws and there's one outlaw called Will Scarlett,Christian Slater,who hates him and he can't understand why.So then on Sunday he goes to church to see the vicar and the sheriff is starting to take an interest in Marian.Robin sees the vicar and the vicar tells him that his father did not want to die with an unclear conscious.He tells him he's lying and when he opens the door to go when he meets the sheriff for the first time.Sheriff has no idea who he is but Robin does and he cuts his cheek with a knife.He then does a bunker and the Sheriff chases after him.But he gets away.So the sheriff puts a price on his head.Then Robin decides to start a war against Nottingham with the outlaws which leads to Nottingham forcing Maid Marian to marry him and he tries to rape her after the wedding.She thinks Robin is dead and excepts Nottingham's offer.But Robin isn't dead and saves Marian from Nottingham just before he nearly gets there.Robin kills Nottingham and marries Marian.Lovely!"
120,"Great movie, easily the most underrated movie of its time. People hate on this movie because it doesn't follow traditional robin hood mythology, what they don't realize is that it isn't meant to be like all the other adaptations of the Robin Hood character. It's original, despite what others say Costner does a swell job in this movie, accompanied by incredible performances by Freeman and The Sheriff.Epic from start to finish, and it actually sits well with you after you see it, unlike most movies these days. Friar Tuck is great. Plenty of memorable quotes from this movie. All the acting is good all around in this movie, just see it and don't listen to all these other critical people. 10/10. The NES game is great too."
121,"I'm obsessed with Robin Hood, and this movie is why. I saw it when it first came out on video, when i was pretty young, and loved it from ""Hello."" Though Kevin Costner's acting is pretty bad in this movie, it is made up for with his fellow actors (Morgan Freeman could carry this movie all by himself, though he doesn't have to).The plot is the usual Robin Hood schmeel. King Richard I has been neglecting his throne, and all the happy lil nobles went with him. Robin was captured while in near Jeruselum, so when he finally escapes, he brings back his own Moor! (Morgan Freeman).There are your random funny quotes between those two, and some more random funnies with Marion too. All told, it's light-hearted for some great quotes.""You whine like a mule. You are still alive."" being one of my favorites.I suggest you all watch it, and ignore Kevin Costner's role. XD"
122,"Okay, so I had some big doubts about this film, expecting it to be too violent, too sexual, too disgusting and too focused around Kevin Costner. But, it was Robin Hood, and had Christian Slater, so I watched it. I was absolutely right on every count. The film was, in nearly equal parts, violent, sexual, disgusting and Costner centrifugal. What I hadn't counted on was that, somehow, it would be in a good way, and work alarmingly well. The film is funny, action packed, touching, romantic, and did I mention, unexpectedly funny? Performances range from good to flawless, and there really are no small parts, or small actors. Some high points: Wulf. Rarely talks, but the kid is wonder, with dead aim and a killer smile. Friar Tuck. Obviously, comic relief, but you have to admire this man- he would have been so easy to write as an overly pious coward, instead he is kind hearted, funny, and never, ever gives up. The Sheriff. Well, it's Alan Rickman, was anyone expecting less than excellence? He is amusing, and you almost (Almost, not quite, mind you) feel sorry for him when he (Gasp) is not the final triumphant victor. Will. Always my favorite character in any Robin Hood story, Will Scarlett rocks so hard you can barely see straight. Cast Christian Slater in the role and add good costume and a couple of plot twists that'll throw your head off, and I have to wonder how it can get better. Of course it does, when his first entrance involves singing a lovely little thief song to the not-so-authentic tune of 'Pop goes the Weasel'. On top of everything, Prince of Thieves has a mind numbingly beautiful soundtrack, and the extended edition has a very nice music video. All in all, a very good movie that should be seen at least once by anyone with a queasy-resistant stomach. 9/10"
123,"I just like to say before I start my comments, that I'm from Belgium and I speak Dutch, so there maybe some faults in this text because writing in English is not so easy, you now. I wanted to see the movie because Alan Rickman plays in it and I really like Alan Rickman. He plays very good in this one, I especially like the sentence:'Locksley, I'm gonna cut your hart out with a spoon.' I don't know why. Somethimes it is funny, but I don't like the witch. The beginning is painful, I think. I closed my eyes on that scene the next time I watched it, but it's a beautiful story, where you can find different themes.My favourite scene is the scene in the church.Where Robin,dressed as a blind man, comes to visit Marian. I also like the scene where Robin fights sheriff Notthingham,but I'm not gonna tell you how it ends, 'cause that would be a spoiler. with kind regards, Riana Moon."
124,"Romantic, action, suspense...what more could you ask for in a movie.  A masterpiece of the 90's!!! Robin Hood has an effect on everyone who watches, filled with memorable lines, enchanting music and an extraordinary cast..I would never recommend another movie if this was one of the evenings options!"
125,"This movie has it: The Magic! Robin Hood is - of course - more or less a fairy tale. As a filmed version of a fairy tale this version is very successful. It has beautiful scenes, good jokes, excitement and - most important of all - clear moral values. I just wonder how come the age limits for this film seem to be so high? Doesn't make sense for me! How about having a ""PG"" for Snow White? In any case, Michael Wincott represents in this film a man I would not like to face, so convincingly evil his Guy of Gisborne is - his face and expressions radiate evilness! The same is true about Alan Rickman's Sheriff! Even Harold Innocent manages to play his part very, very convincinly! Kevin Costner may not be the perfect Robin of Locksley, but hey, this is a fairy tale! In fact K.C. does a very good job, too! It doesn't matter too much that in the movie Robin has a Moorish companion, this just adds a bit of color and quite a few good laughs to the film. Morgan Freeman plays his part with perfect professionalism. At the end of the film there is an intelligent cameo performance, too! This film is perfect entertainment."
126,"Kevin Costner had unbelievable amount of good films from 1987-1992, with this one and Dances with  Wolves being at the forefront.  The mixture of comedy, action and drama is just in the right proportion, and lines like `I'll cut your heart out with a spoon' being something everyone remembers from this film.  I'm sure that one could find a lot to criticize, but there is not need.  This film became an instant classic, is thoroughly entertaining, hilarious, with visual confetti and great action scenes. 9/10"
127,"I loved this movie, its one I could watch over and over again and never tire of it!  If youre a fan, you shouldnt miss this one.Kevin Costner is superb in the role!  The rest of the cast was just as good. I loved the young Christian Slater in this movie, he had some good humourous moments!  Check this one out!"
128,"Kevin Costner takes on the English legend surrounding the English archer, Robin Hood, during the times of medieval England, and the members of the viewing public are the big winners.  Some critics may really put down the lack by Costner of an English accent, or something even close, but that shortage does not subtract from a spectacular rendition of the legend.In ""Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves"", Costner portrays the English bowman who returns from the Crusades to find his father killed and the family lands taken by the Sheriff of Nottingham, sharply etched in cinematic meanness by Alan Rickman.  By legend, the Sheriff was simply acting as an aide to Prince John, who was trying to secure the throne of England for himself, in the absence of King Richard.  Here, however, the Sheriff is acting on his own, and no mention is even made of John.  Rickman's performance is quite noteworthy on its own, but does come up a tad short when measured against the superb acting turned in by Morgan Freeman, who plays a Moor rescued by Robin and who is on his side as a staunch ally against the Sheriff.No use going into the story, but look for top-notch battle scenes, true-to-the period costuming, and very good dialog.  Costner, Freeman, and Rickman are the leading male roles, while Mary Elizabeth Mastrononi gives the Maid Marion character a nice acting bit.  Look for a surprise cameo by Sean Connerly as King Richard, as well as the musical rendition by Bryan Adams of the title song ""Everything I Do, I Do It For You.""A good 9/10"
129,"I loved this Movie !!!  Kevin did a Fantastic job in it.. if he was ""Robin Hood"" , i would want to be there in Sherwood Forest with Him !!!everyone in this movie did a great job, especially Alan Rickman as the Sheriff of Nottingham.. what a creep !!! He is Excellent at playing bad guys.. i would love to go back to that time.. and hang out with them all.. it would be soo neat.. this movie is great, good acting, lots of action, and a good story to it.. i Highly recommend it to anyone who likes Kevin Costner.. i sure do Love the guy. hes a very talented actor.. ive only one bad thing to say about Him.. he should stick to acting and not directing.. he was great in ""The Untouchables"" and in ""Field Of Dreams"" ... if he'd just learn not to make three hour movies.. everything would be just fine.. why he made ""WaterWorld, or the Postman"" i'll Never know.... just wish he'd stick to the acting.. hes Much better at that..."
130,"While it's true that each of these actors has starred in films that easily rival Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (for example, Field of Dreams, The Shawshank Redemption, Interview With The Vampire, and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, respectively), this is definitely one of the best adaptations of the classic Robin Hood story ever made, and that includes the excellent Disney version (not the best by Disney's astronomical standards, but still very good). The film takes place near the end of the 12th century in Jerusalem, and the effectiveness with which the time period is brought to the screen is one of the best parts of this amazingly well made film. Not only is every last character in the film, even down to the peasant extras, meticulously made to look exactly as they would be expected to have looked over 800 years ago, the settings as well as the sets were also stunningly realistic.
Kevin Costner and Alan Rickman have great chemistry on screen as the mortal enemies from the classic Robin Hood tale, as do Costner and Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio, as the beloved Maid Marian. Rickman delivers a career defining performance as the hated and despised Sherriff of Nottingham who, in this film, is probably one of the best villains ever portrayed in a movie, and who far surpasses any of the Bond villains. Morgan Freeman is flawlessly cast as Ozeem, a Moorish warrior who devotes himself to Robin, vowing to remain by his side until he has returned Robin's favor of saving his life. These are just a few examples of the countless phenomenal performances in this film - everyone involved delivered a perfect performance in his or her role. There is really only one scene that falters (the scene where Will Scarlett (Christian Slater) tells Robin that they are brothers), and that's just the result of an overly emotional scene, not bad editing on Slater's part. The Friar Tuck is a particularly memorable character, because his transformation in character from the beginning to the end of the film is one of the best examples of the intricate characterization in the movie.Another noteworthy element of this film is the breathtaking battle scenes. Not only are they amazingly well crafted, keeping you on the edge of your seat throughout, but they are also amazingly realistic and tastefully executed. There really isn't very much blood or guts, and I think that the less gore that a filmmaker manages to put in a battle while not losing any effectiveness, the better the result. However, there are a few exceptions to this general rule, such as most of Saving Private Ryan, but the huge amounts of gore in that movie were put in with good reason to evoke a specific reaction to historically accurate events. This film deserves so much praise that it is impossible to fit it all into a single review, especially a review with a 1,000 word cap. There is the perfect mixture of action, drama, and comedy to keep it exciting, interesting, and entertaining, while at the same time to not compromise the solid narrative structure or reduce the extent to which the film can be taken seriously, but still enjoyed on a light-hearted level. This is one of those cinematic gems that is tragically rare, and should forever be treasured."
131,This movie is extremely entertaining.  An excellent cast and an outstanding storyline tells the legend of Robin Hood.  An obviously different film that the legendary Flynn and Connery movies.  This one is just as good and has very few flaws.  A rating of 9 out of 10 was given.
132,"I enjoyed this film immensely. Robin was well done by Costner, and the evil Sheriff was perfectly cast. For my money he made the show. The scenes were well set up and gave one a sense of being in another time and place. Lots of action with beautiful sets. A little hokey in spots, but hey, it's Robin Hood."
133,"Deep in the forest that is. But back to the beginning which at least in the longer cut I watched (took me long enough to get around to this I know, but at least I went all the way too - sometime soon it will be also time for Dances with Wolves) is quite gruesome and feels brutal. Hands getting cut off, a lot of torture and all that.Not something one may consider a family movie. But the tone will switch and become a bit lighter. While the movie itself felt more like an 80s kind of thing (hairdos included), it was made in the early 90s. And had not just Kevin Costner (arguably the biggest star back then with many hits under his belt), but also the support of many good actors! Morgan Freeman being the top name amongst them (if you discount a very late cameo by someone else). Funny about Freeman is that he plays someone of Muslim believe just to play God later on in his career. Or maybe I'm just amused by that (not in a bad way mind you).The movie has many things you may already know from the legend that is Robin Hood but takes its time to tell them. There are also some tweaks ... but one of the major and another really good move was to cast Alan Rickman! What a great villain! And you need those to make a good movie.You also need a good soundtrack. Or at least a movie works better with it. And Bryan Adams did quite the song for the movie, which you can hear throughout, sometimes just as a sample ... great song. So many really good things here, but the pacing and the age may take a few points off for some. Still this is entertaining nonetheless and production values are there to enjoy"
134,"(Flash Review)It is what it is. A Kevin Costner big budget epic from the early 90's. Complete with his overly calm demeanor, to a fault, and dashing leading man looks as Robin Hood pitted against Alan Rickman as the dastardly scheming Sheriff of Nottingham. The acting and casting hurt this film as Costner was too monotone for this role in contrast to Rickman, the film's bright acting spot. Morgan Freeman's Muslim sidekick role felt underutilized and Christian Slater was too Christian Slater for his role. The film had very good analog and genuine 90s effects, many chasing action scenes and overall this was an easy to watch formulaic Hollywood blockbuster. It is amazing how substandard acting or dialog can drag all the positives down. Thankfully, Rickman nailed his role."
135,"Revisited this early nineties blockbuster and I couldn't help but compare it to the Ridley Scott/Russell Crowe adaptation released more recently.The screenplay of this version is what shall I say...fantasy. It is enjoyable in parts but I prefer the more serious historical style of the Scott/Crowe adaptation of the story.The scenery is breathtaking. One cannot imagine Nottingham having such treasures! Indeed the film was shot around locales in Britain.
There are geographical inaccuracies in parts that only an Englishman will recognise. I mean, Hood arrives back on the English south coast and in the next scene he is magically on Hadrians Wall in Northumberland hundreds of miles away!The late Rickman is great as the evil Sheriff and in parts does overshadow the main star of the time Kevin Costner. Although he tries valiently I cannot take serious a Hollywood chancer as English outlaw Robin Hood. His Hollywood accent is out of place. At least Crowe dons (or attempts to) an English/Sean Bean hybrid accent in his version. The same can be said of the casting of a young looking Christian Slater.
The action is good which is hardly surprising as regular Brit technicians from the Bond movies are involved.All in all an enjoyable romp. Perhaps a little over rated at the time of its release in no small part due to Brian Adams success with the title song from the movie, Everything I Do...which seemed to be No. 1 for months if I remember. I digress. Definately worth a return to Nottingham if you haven't seen for a few years.Every time I watch a TV broadcast of this film there seems to be more scenes. There seem to be two components to this film.
The actual Robin Hood and his merry men component and a Sheriff of Nottingham/witch/mother Morteana (Geraldine McEwan) component."
136,"It really was better than the 6.9 IMDb score as I type this. It had an excellent cast, a good sound track and the story was already legendary. A good blend of action and comedy make this very entertaining. Rickman was brilliant as the Sheriff of Nottingham. It's easily the best Robin Hood adaption."
137,"I've always been a fan of the baddie in films - and this film really belongs to Alan Rickman's ""Sheriff"" with a good supporting effort from Geraldine McEwan as his harridan witch cohort. They bring almost all of humour and menace. The bulk of the rest of the film is a pretty run-of-the-mill vehicle for Costner, Freeman and Mastrantonio - and moves along well enough as a pretty formulaic, very freely adapted, costume drama. Brian Blessed hams marvellously in the few scenes he has and the score works well into the fabric of the movie. Sadly, the writing and direction are nothing special. Errol and Basil have little to worry about."
138,"One of the best sword fight I have ever seen. Robin Hood had to fight to win that battle. That witch too, she didn't know when to die."
139,"Overall, this movie falls smack dab in the middle of good and bad. There are some truly standout moments and performances, but as a whole the movie fails to evoke a great emotional response. I enjoy this film for what it is: a swashbuckling adventure that doesn't take itself seriously, but I could absolutely see where others would find this movie predictable and over the top. In the end, the choice is yours. Perhaps this movie just got under my skin too early, because I can forgive all the little flaws for the sake of a story I truly and unironically enjoy.

140,Never again will there be a movie that as awesome as this did this story line....
141,"When you stand back and look at it objectively, this movie has a lot of problems. Kevin Costner gives what is probably the worst performance of his career as Robin Hood, and besides that most of the dialogue by all the characters except Alan Rickman's sheriff of Nottingham is mediocre at best. And the movie is long with some sluggish and unnecessary scenes.BUT, I have to say that despite all that , this is still an enjoyable way to kill two and a half hours. Alan Rickman was great when he had a role that would allow him to over act, and he does it with great abandon as the fanatical and , well, mentally ill, evil sheriff. His performance is simply what moves this film from the thumbs down into the thumbs up category . Also on the plus side id the depiction of the merry men (and woman) of Sherwood forest who get more development in the story than is usually seen in Robin Hood flicks.Morgan Freeman is underused as Robin Hood's Moorish sidekick.Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is effective as the Maid Marian."
142,"What can I say? I really dug this movie.
Yes, Kosner doesn't sound like Robin Hood, but he plays the part well. (His accent stunk)The story is very well put together. Interesting throughout the entire movie.
Great camera work, great scenery throughout.Robin (Kosner) escapes from prison with Morgan Freeman and return to Robins homeland only to find his father murdered and his castle burned to the ground by sheriff Nottingham and his henchmen.Robin, bent on revenge links up with some woodsman to resist Nottinghams power hungry attempt to overthrow King Richard (Sean Connery)."
143,This is the only Robin Hood movie I will ever watch. The acting and quality of the storyline is superb. I was intrigued from the very beginning and was pleasantly surprised to find that the events portrayed in the movie are very accurate. This movie will most definitely be placed under my favorites.
144,"Preface: 
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is foremost an action film transporting the classic men in tights action of the 30s into the mature and gritty film scene of the 90s. It has its moments, and hints at a story that could have been much more than it was. However, it is ultimately disappointing for some poor script writing, questionable acting from Costner at times, and a lack of cohesion in what it wished to do with the classic story. My point being, this film is messy but fun, and ultimately really watchable because Alan Rickman owns his role as the Sheriff of Nottingham. The music is amazing, so definitly listen to the soundtrack, but this does not save the film. To make my point I need to give minor spoilers on why this film is ultimately just fine.The Review Proper:
This film's fault primarily lies with what it could have been, and hints at wanting to do, which is to reinvent Robin Hood for a modern audience. Films of the 80s preceeding this blockbuster are a far cry from the classics of Golden Age Hollywood. Terminator and Alien provide a grisly and gritty take on the sci-fi genre, previously saturated with the more up-beat Star Wars. Prince of Thieves is similarly far more gritty than the 30s classic, and the darker bloodier tone exemplifies this. The Sheriff, rather than being an upstarted administrator, is an ambitious would-be royal consorting with a witch who uses blood for prophesy. One of Robin's company was his father's chamberlain, blinded by the Sheriff's men. The tone of this film demonstratively shows that it wishes to distance itself from the campy Errol Flynn classic.More progressive ideas also permeate the narrative; Morgan Freeman is now Robin Hood's right-hand man and is primarily there to show the prejudices of Medieval Christians against Muslims. Marian's introduction is not as a fair maiden singing out of a window; she ambushes Robin sword in hand and tries to kill him. The problems in the narrative come quickly when looking just below the surface. Azeem's character arc is a little too on the nose to provide any subtlety to its point. We are repeatedly told of his plight and the director doesn't provide many more visual cues to develop the idea. With Marian it unfortunately gets worse. Marian's introduction is interesting on many levels, primarily because it is a subversion of the classic maiden image of the lady of legend. However, she drifts back into damsel mode as the story progresses, and by the conclusion is entirely reliant on Robin to save her. This heavily underminds the interesting set up the narrative provides.Consequently, this film suggests it wants to darken and subvert the Robin Hood narrative, which is reinforced by a fantastic scene early in the second act. The Sheriff's men hunt down villagers to rile them up against Robin Hood and it succeeds. Village folk are driven to Sherwood forest and blaim Robin, accurately, for their plight and Will Scarlett adds his voice to their anger. This provides set up for the final subversion of the legend, suggesting the wonderful idea that Robin Hood is no legend, merely an arrogant and selfish noble made into an outlaw. The potential of this is superb for story-telling as the writer could explore the implications of Robin's actions on the people, critique the intentions of those with personal vendettas or even question legends as stories that conceil murkier truths. It is a compelling idea to develop and question the character of such a legend and it is a relevant theme to explore in our time where ""heroes"" of our society are dethroned when their morals are unveiled, muting their actions.The largest disappointment of this film is that these ideas are dropped so that the classic 30s storytelling is brought in to write its own finale. The action mutes the morality of the story. Over half the film falls back on its setup to provide a classic, generically Robin Hood good vs evil action romp. It becomes a by the numbers action film, and thus suppresses its potential. Robin Hood and its genre turns on the spotlights to the stage and extinguishes the candle lit on stage by the exceptional set up. In other words, Prince of Thieves both succeeds and fails because it is a Robin Hood film that must tell the Robin Hood story.But there is still much to enjoy here. Alan Rickman plays so well as a narcissistic and ambitious Sheriff, with so many great lines, that it is worth watching just for his Bafta winning performance. For all my complaints about the story it is still an eminantly enjoyable action film. Several set pieces provide explosions galore of entertainment. The final act in particular is full of tense and exhilerating action. It is just a shame that the narrative is too weak to support the film.Conclusion:
Robin Hood is not a bad film, merely an alright one with a disappointing story. It provides all that is needed from a Robin Hood film, hinting at a better story that would have provided a deconstruction of the legend. It is admirable for what it tried to do, but ultimately a lesser film for what it did. So my view is watch it for Alan Rickman and the score. You will be entertained but if you are watching it because you want a good Robin Hood movie then turn it off and watch the Errol Flynn 30s classic instead. Prince of Thieves does not dethrone The Adventures of Robin Hood from its well earned place as the finest Robin Hood film."
145,"I recently watched this to see how it held up over time and unfortunately its age is starting to show. American audiences in the early 1990s didn't get hung up on details like cultural accuracy, but today, thankfully, they are more discerning. The frivolity of 1990s film making is beginning to show through in the numerous cracks in this film, yet it still manages to be entertaining in spite of Kevin Costner not even attempting a British accent, or any of the other numerous flaws. I don't know if this is a spoiler or not but for example, at the film's climax Costner and Freeman are trying to bash through a door that has been barred on the other side. Somehow the witch character appears inside the room, then on the outside where she confronts them, then at the very end she's back inside the room hiding for the right moment to pop out and surprise everyone...all while the door is still barricaded and Morgan freeman is still bashing away trying to get in. Oh well, overall the film still manages to be somewhat entertaining (probably thanks to Alan Rickman) but if you saw this in the early 1990s you might cringe watching it now."
146,"""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" was a blockbuster success in 1991, a time when Kevin Costner's popularity was at its apex. Even at the time, though, his casting as the quintessentially British folk hero raised eyebrows. Twenty-five years later, has the movie stood the test of time or is just another disposable Hollywood romp? The answer lies somewhere in between.Everyone knows the gist of the Robin Hood legend: a dashing thief who steals from the rich and gives to the poor, in love with the beautiful Maid Marion and pursued by the wicked Sheriff of Nottingham, the story has all of the ingredients for an old-fashioned swashbuckling adventure. Pen Denham's screenplay plays fast and loose with the legend, which is probably a good thing given all of the earlier versions of Robin Hood on film & television. While certain elements of the screenplay may be somewhat anachronistic or otherwise questionable, on its own merits the story is an entertaining one that captures the spirit of the character.Kevin Costner's portrayal of the title character is a sore spot for many viewers but I must admit that he does have a certain rogue-ish charm, even if he doesn't bother to attempt an English accent. In any case, he was fortunate to have some fine support from the likes of Morgan Freeman, Alan Rickman & Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. In smaller roles, Michael McShane (Friar Tuck) & Michael Wincott (Guy of Gisbourne) make a particular impression.When it comes to Kevin Reynolds' direction, though, I'd have to say that I wasn't particularly impressed by it. Competent but with rarely anything of particular visual interest, the movie pales in comparison to the Technicolor splendour of the gold standard of Robin Hood movies, ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"". The Michael Kamen score is similarly undistinguished, though the theme song (performed & co-written by Bryan Adams) is admittedly rather good as far as rock ballads go.All in all, ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" is a pretty good popcorn movie but not an enduring classic on the level of ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"". Costner's performance may be problematic but it doesn't derail the entire movie. A standout performance from Alan Rickman (along with some other good work in supporting roles) propels the movie more than adequately.(By the way, I recommend the extended cut over the theatrical version of the film. It may add 12 minutes onto an already fairly long movie but it includes some material that fleshes out the characters a bit more.)"
147,"I just re-watched this recently - first, Alan Rickman steals this film. Every time he is on screen the film comes alive. But outside of that its all a little serious - and I understand the desire to move away from the Errol Flynn image, but that doesn't mean it can't be fun. The trouble with too many Robin Hood movies is they feel the need to over explain the back-story rather than have fun with his adventures robbing the rich. We do get a few scenes of that fun, but not enough. Maybe that seems nitpicking but the wonderful hideout in the woods is barely glimpsed and we could have spent so much more time there. That said, it's a good watch and better than some, more recent Robin Hood interpretations."
148,"'Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves' has faced at least as many slings and arrows as its titular character in the two plus decades since it became a smash hit in the Summer of 1991, and yet it endures. Yes, we know that Kevin Costner and his American co-stars give a half-hearted attempt at their English accents and Costner was upstaged by Alan Rickman's devilish turn as the Sheriff of Nottingham, but despite all this--and the very 90s mullets, closing power ballad and 90s PC clich√©s--'Prince of Thieves' has actually aged quite well.With one foot firmly planted in the swashbuckling classics of the past, it still managed to bring the genre to the doorstep of the 21st century, deftly blending the lighter elements and darker undercurrents. The result is a handsome, rousing and romantic adventure story. It ain't art, but what's wrong with that?"
149,"Released in 1991, ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" stars Kevin Costner in the title role. While some have argued that Costner was too humorless and brooding for the part, this is a cinematic myth. There are quite a few places in the film where he can be seen smiling and having a good time, like when he makes it back to England after the Crusades or when he's spending time with Marian in Sherwood Forest. Thankfully, he's more three-dimensional than this and so you also see him desperate, angry, grieving, vengeful, strategizing, contemplative, etc.To be honest with you, Costner was in his prime at the time and towers in the role; whether or not you like him is a matter of opinion. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Marian is memorable with her unique facial features and odd hairstyle even though she doesn't trip my trigger. Morgan Freeman as the Moor Azeem is an excellent partner for Robin Hood while Alan Rickman and Michael Wincott are effective villains as the Sheriff of Nottingham and Guy of Gisborne respectively. Christian Slater, Nick Brimble and Michael McShane are also on hand as Robin's sometimes merry men, the latter two being Little John and Friar Tuck.I've always had mixed feelings about this movie due to its mixed tone and the fact that it loses its mojo in the last 45 minutes. Concerning the first, the flick is often serious and brutal, but it's also sometimes cartoonish and over-the-top. Rickman particularly hams it up, entertaining though he is. Another good example is Geraldine McEwan as the ee-vil witch Mortianna. Her portrayal is spooky and Gothic in a comic book horror kind of way, but it detracts from the many parts that establish the story as believable quasi-history. Still, she's excellent as the hideous witch. Another example is the semi-goofy, overly heroic action scenes, like Robin & Azeem being catapulted over the castle wall. Why sure!Concerning the second criticism, the movie is overlong by about 25 minutes. When the Celts attack the camp at the 95-minute mark I always start to lose interest and the rest of the movie is a tedious blur. But there's a lot of medieval action, if that's your thang.As far as medieval films of the British Isles go, I prefer the more serious and consistent tone of ""Tristan + Isolde"" (2006) and ""First Knight"" (1995). Nevertheless, ""Prince of Thieves"" an entertaining Robin Hood adventure and is iconic of early 90's cinema. The entire first act is the best part followed by the many Sherwood Forest sequences. And the climatic cameo by a certain famous actor is a nice touch. I enjoy seeing ""Prince of Thieves"" every five years or so.The film runs 143 minutes and was shot mostly in England, but also France. My wife loves the end credits' song ""(Everything I Do) I Do it for You"" by Bryan Adams.GRADE: B/B-"
150,"Films about the legendary outlaw Robin Hood have always been a great source of entertainment. Prince of Thieves probably takes the most liberty, but it is also having the most fun. This is in no way an attempt to accurately portray the struggles in England during the time and if you can accept that it's using the folklore to make an exciting piece of cinema then you'll enjoy this fine. In taking this approach I find Prince of Thieves to be a really enjoyable film in the same vein as the classic adventure flicks, but with more action and visual tricks. It had a lot of debatable decisions, mainly casting an American as Hood, and not all of it works yet it's still a nice surprise that things turned out as well as they did.Things begin with nobleman Robin Hood returning from the crusades with Moor warrior Azeem to find that his father has been killed and the Sheriff of Nottingham has taken over his lands. With King Richard still absent, Robin decides to fight back as an outlaw. Along the way Robin falls in with the men of the forest who share his views and gets Maid Marian to join his cause. There are no major changes to the basic tale. It is nice to see Robin with a close friend and the compassion between the 'merry men' is done well, but the love story can seem a little forced at times. The story is easy to follow however and flows along nicely, there aren't any parts that drag on and that's what you want in an adventure flick.The writing is, for the most part, quite hit and miss. Parts of the dialogue seems awkward in some areas, especially in the romantic scenes. While there are some truly fantastic lines in any scene involving the Sheriff of Nottingham. The story is set-up well however, there is a good reason for Robin's battle against Nottingham. Also the way the merry men and Marian are introduced to the story is done smartly and doesn't come off as if they were forced into the film.The biggest issue many have is with Costner and his American accent. I am not a fan of his either. He's just too wooden to truly convince and his American accent does get distracting at times. I also don't think he manages to find the right balance in the role, he always comes off as either too cheerful or too brooding. The rest of the cast is very good however. Morgan Freeman is a solid presence as Azeem, while Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is surprisingly excellent as Marian as she brings a lot of warmth to the role. Nick Brimble is pretty much perfect as Little John and Michael McShane is a lot of fun as Tuck. However Christian Slater does struggle to do a convincing accent and does a little too much moping to be that interesting as Scarlett.The most praise deservedly goes to Alan Rickman as the Sheriff. He's hamming it up to the extreme, but he is clearly loving every minute of it. Everything from his animated movements to his contorted facial expressions work wonderfully and he also delivers a number of hilarious lines. He is the driving force of the film and every scene he's in is truly entertaining. As his support the gravel voiced Michael Wincott is brilliant as always as the slimy Gisborne and Geraldine McEwan is delightfully creepy as the witch Mortianna.The action scenes are staged well and do get quite brutal at times, with a surprising amount of blood flying around. I'm glad the film doesn't shy away from the violence and this does give it more of an edge. The big battle with the Celts has a lot of swordplay and intense moments. The climax is excellent, packed with plenty of tension and a real sense of importance that many action films miss out on. The old-fashioned climatic sword fight that follows is also a lot of fun. The only issue is that some of the camera angles and cuts in the action scenes can get a bit strange.Michael Kamen delivers a decent score, filled with the appropriate amounts of bombast. The main theme is heroic and does get you pumped up for the battle ahead. But it is quite unmemorable on the whole, plus I'm not a fan of the famous Bryan Adams song that is used orchestral throughout.Visually the film is very good. The locations all look authentic and a lot of the shots of the scenery do have a sense of atmosphere to them. A number of shots are deliberately murky looking and do get across that this was a gloomy time in England. I also like the costumes and they are what I imagined people back in those days would decide to wear. The castles and forests used give a good impression of medieval times as well. Yet I do think that Kevin Reynolds shoots some parts strangely. As said some shots in the action scenes are edited bizarrely and the wide-angled lens gets used a few times too which makes everything look unpleasant.I understand that many will have reservations about Prince of Thieves and I have a few myself, but there is no denying that is extremely entertaining. It makes up for many of the problems it has. The story is inaccurate and a bit too simple, but it moves along at a good pace. Kevin Costner is very bland and dull in the title role, but Alan Rickman is wildly entertaining and the rest of the cast is pretty great. There is plenty of exciting action that has a more fierce approach and the visuals are always impressive. Overall if you are looking for an fun-filled adventure film where you don't have to think all the time then there aren't many better than Prince of Thieves."
151,"There have been countless adaptation of the legend of Robin Hood over the years, from tales and plays to books and movies. Most people know both the character and the story quite well, and thus it's up to each adaptation to both remain faithful to the essence of Robin Hood and to spice up the formula a little bit.In this regard Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves succeeds remarkably well. True, it borrows rather heavily from the famous Robin of Sherwood TV series, but ultimately it is its own creation and updates the character to a new decade, at least within cinema. No longer is Robin Hood depicted as a jolly good fellow in bright green tights. Rather the visual style is a lot grittier and more realistic. A welcome update in my opinion. The addition of Morgan Freeman as a wise Moorish warrior Azeem is also a delight to witness. Easily the best character in the whole film and given a surprisingly respectful portrayal despite him being obviously Islamic. A rarity back then and a rarity even still.It cannot be denied, however, that there are a lot of aspects to this film that divide people's opinions. For example, the performances of Kevin Costner and Alan Rickman. It'd be easy to claim that the first one is too stoic and the latter too over-the-top and hammy. I honestly didn't have problems with them. Sure Rickman chewed more scene than an army of bulldozers, but that was part of the charm. And I've never had any problems with Costner's performances. Still, he is one of those ""love him or hate him"" type of actors so if you haven't liked him in other films, this one won't change your mind.I enjoyed this film a lot. It has everything a Robin Hood film should have: daring adventures, sword fights, archery, greedy castle lords and sheriffs, jolly outlaws, fair maidens, heroics and villainy, great deeds, love, tragedy and triumph. Easily the best Robin Hood film I have yet seen."
152,"Kevin Costner, Morgan Freeman, Alan Rickman, Christian Slater and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio star in this 1991 adventure film. This takes place in 12th century medieval times focusing on Robin of Locksley (Costner) who returns home to England with new friend, Azeem (Freeman) after escaping from a Jerusalem prison. Robin discovers that his father has been murdered by a corrupt Sheriff, George of Nottingham (Rickman). Robin decides to take on the sheriff by stealing from him and give to the poor becoming an outlaw. Soon, Robin leads a group of exiled people in Sherwood Forest trying to bring freedom to the land. Slater (Heathers) plays Will Scarlett, a young man who is revealed to be Robin's brother and Mastrantonio (Scarface) plays Robin's beloved, Maid Marian. I saw this when it came out at the movies and liked it since. The cast is good, especially Rickman who plays a great villain as usual and Michael Kamen's score is also great. I recommend this good adventure flick."
153,"I remember when this movie first came out. I loved it so much that I saw it three times in the cinema. It was a movie that simply came out beautifully on the big screen, but when it appeared on video my opinion changed dramatically. Now, having watched it recently on television, my opinion has once again changed, namely that it is an enjoyable movie but not one that deserves to be fully praised.A lot of people have said that Kevin Costner's American accent ruined this movie. As such I paid close attention to Costner and I couldn't pick up any sign of an accent. His lines seemed to come out much different to those around him, but it was not because of any accent. Rather it seems that his lines came out quite unrealistically. It seemed that Costner was acting in a fantasy romance while everybody else was acting in a normal film. The high browed tone of his voice started to annoy me after a while because it seemed that his character was far above those of his merry men.Robin Hood is such a well-known story that we need not discuss the plot: King Richard is away on the crusades and the Sheriff of Nottingham wants to claim the throne for himself. Robin is a dispossessed noble who has been ousted by the Sheriff and flees to Sherwood Forest where he joins up with a band of robbers and begins a crusade of robbing from the rich and giving to the poor. What is different in these movies is the background. Prince of Thieves has Robin returning from the Crusades to find his father murdered and the land is under the rule of the tyrannical Sheriff.To me I thought that the whole idea of freedom in this movie is too unrealistic. This is an example of placing American ideals onto a world where they did not exist. Back in that time, there was no freedom in the way we understand freedom now. Nobody had a choice as to who ruled, whether it be the Sheriff or whether it be king Richard. Robin is constantly saying that he is fighting for the freedom of the people but it is really just revenge for the death of his father. He might be giving money to the poor, but it is a political stunt to turn the people against the Sheriff and protect him. The sheriff raises the bounties but people won't hand Robin in because he is giving them money.Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is a memorable movie. It is one to watch every so often and too enjoy. It is one that people remember and speak about, but it is simply one created to make money and nothing more. Still I enjoy it once in a while."
154,"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves***(out of 4)143 mins/ PGCast: Kevin Costner, Morgan Freeman, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Christian Slater, Alan Rickman, Geraldine McEwan, Michael McShane, Brian Blessed, Michael Wincott, Nick Brimble, Sean ConneryDirector: Kevin ReynoldsPlot: After Robin returns from the Crusades, he trains up a band of merry men to fight against the tyranny of the Sheriff of Nottingham.JJ's Verdict: In Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, we may have awfully cheesy dialogue but with ridiculous amounts of fun and epic swashbuckling that Robin Hood should always be. In the Hollywood version of Robin Hood, we have the traditional story we have always loved with one or two aspects tweaked for good effect - no silly sub-plots like Ridley Scott's 2010 version. Robin returns from the crusades with a Muslim warrior Azeem and finds his father dead, and that the Sheriff of Nottingham is plotting to take the crown from the absent Richard the Lionheart. From here, Robin and Azeem come across a band of men, driven from their homes by Nottingham. Whilst also entertaining Lady Marian, the King's cousin, Robin and Azeem train the local villagers to into an army to fight and rise up against the dictatorship of the Sheriff of Nottingham.Yes, Kevin Costner and Christian Slater's accents stink, but Prince of Thieves is so much fun. From its heroic theme tune and Bryan Adams epic power ballad, to its dazzling, swashbuckling sword waving and total charm, this is probably the finest and most accomplished action/adventure film since Indiana Jones. The ambushes are all brilliantly set-up and choreographed and all the characters are great fun. Kevin Costner brings charm and strong patriotism to his role, and has great chemistry with Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's Lady Marian. Morgan Freeman is his usual knowledgeable self and Alan Rickman is just brilliantly over-the-top as the evil Sheriff of Nottingham. Christian Slater's character does at first seem like an arrogant idiot but even he grows on you. Geraldine McEwan's fortune-telling witch is the only character who actually doesn't work.There isn't much to its actual plot but Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is an absolute (if incredibly cheesy) blast. It has a thrilling action finale and to top it all off, Sean Connery appears at the end as King Richard. Harmless fun!"
155,"It's a decent Robin Hood film, even if there are some uneven passages. Freeman wasn't bad but I didn't get what his character should bring to the story. And they didn't know where they should go with Marian; first she was built up as a strong-willed and confident swashbuckling character, then she became a Damsel-in-Distress ...Apart from that, the film was OK; the basic rules for Robin Hood stories (outlaws outwitting the Sheriff's men) are adhered to, and the production values and sets are good. Some people made fun of his accent, but Kevin Costner has a roguish smile fitting the character and I couldn't care less about his accent (maybe a Britishman will disagree)."
156,"This awful song rolls across the credits courtesy of mediocre Canadian soft rocker Bryan Adams. It sets the tone for this movie. It's something you'll either love or hate, in my case it's a bit of both.There's a good story here about Robin Hood returning from the Crusades to find his father dead and leading the English people in rebellion against the tyrannical Sheriff but Kevin Costner is so bad in this it's almost lost.The performances of Alan Rickman, Morgan Freeman and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio all almost make up for how bad Costner is in this. In a joke from Robin: Men in Tights Cary Elwes' Robin Hood says, ""unlike some other Robin Hoods I can speak with an English accent,"" alluding to the other major problem with Costner's performance-no attempt at sounding English. Instead he sounds like a nondescript American with a bad hair day sporting his post-Crusade mullet. Alan Rickman's scene stealing performance as The Sheriff of Nottingham aided by his devil worshiping foster mother is something to behold. His over-the-top displays of temper and mustache-twirling evil are a lot of fun to watch.Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's Maid Marian is a strong-willed woman committed to watching after an English people seemingly abandoned by Richard the Lionheart (which it was) and men like Robin Hood who rushed off to the Crusades in religious zeal or the pursuit of riches. Morgan Freeman is Azeem, Robin's solemn Moorish companion, who acts as an unwanted protector and straight man. Surprisingly there's no mention of Prince John, Richard I's brother, who is often depicted in Robin Hood adaptations as working with the Sheriff and Sir Guy of Gisbon to usurp the throne."
157,"I heard so many negative things about this movie so I decided not to watch it until recently. I had nothing else to watch, so I decided to watch this. I thought it was better than everyone described, but I seen much better Robin Hood movies.Well, we all know the story of Robin Hood. So the plot is very predictable. But the plot is darker and gloomier than you would expect.The acting isn't terrible. I thought Kevin Costner was miscast. He doesn't even use an English accent. However the performances by Morgan Freeman and Alan Rickman were thrilling. I was delighted by the cameo of Sean Connery.The music is solid. I loved the song by Bryan Adams. It's one of my favorite all-time songs. The score's not too bad, but it seems somewhat monotonous.Overall, this is a decent movie with solid action scenes. It may not be suitable for young children though. I rate this film 7/10."
158,"The greatest first: The atmosphere was amazing. The movie was shot in perfect colors. Especially in the castles the shots have been amazing. I rarely saw light used so well in a movie. The music was helping the movie's atmosphere a lot. The perfectly fitting costumes did the rest. The movie was pretty much perfect for ear and eye. Great have also been the actors. Every actor fit perfectly into their role. Especially the evil counterparts amazed me. - I have never seen such an evil looking witch. For the ""brain"" the movie wasn't so great. It's average Hollywood cheese: With some corniness, an average story, some silly jokes and everything else that belongs to usual Hollywood movies. It's Hollywood's take on the Robin Hood story - don't expect something ""historical"". This movie doesn't have much to do with the old Robin Hood stories. (It doesn't even have much to do with the older Erol Flyn movie.) It's fun nonetheless."
159,"""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" was one of two films about Robin Hood made in 1991; the other, titled simply ""Robin Hood"", starred Patrick Bergin and Uma Thurman, was made on a smaller budget and is much less well known today. The theme has been a popular one in the cinema and on television ever since at least the classic Errol Flynn version from 1938. In my childhood in sixties Britain the definitive Robin was Richard Greene, hero of a famous TV series, and Sean Connery (who has a brief cameo here as King Richard) and Audrey Hepburn starred together in ""Robin and Marion"" in the seventies.In this version the hero is Robin of Locksley, an English nobleman who is captured while fighting with Richard the Lionheart in the Crusades. Robin escapes from prison and returns to England accompanied by Azeem, a Moor whose life he saved during the jail-break. (The idea of having a Moorish character among the Merry Men appears to have been borrowed from the earlier British TV series ""Robin of Sherwood""). Upon arrival, however, he finds that in King Richard's absence England is being ruled by the cruel Sheriff of Nottingham who has murdered Robin's father and seized his lands.The film breaks with tradition by inserting the character of Azeem and omitting Prince John, normally one of Robin's main antagonists; perhaps the film-makers felt that it was best to concentrate on the Sheriff rather than have two principal villains. In most other respects, however, it keeps to the traditional story. Robin escapes into Sherwood Forest where he joins forces with a band of outlaws, refugees from the Sheriff's tyranny. Robin and his men fight back against the Sheriff by robbing him and his wealthy supporters then distributing the stolen money and goods among the common people. (This is only justice as they have acquired this wealth by imposing harsh taxes on the poor).Robin also meets and falls in love with the beautiful Maid Marian, in this version the sister of a comrade killed during the escape attempt. We meet other characters from the traditional story- Little John, Will Scarlet and Friar Tuck. The film has an equally traditional morality- greed is bad, oppression ditto, the common people possess hidden reserves of courage and decency, good will triumph over evil and love conquers all.Although Kevin Costner was a well-known actor in the 1980s, starring in films like ""The Untouchables"" and ""Field of Dreams"", it was the grand epic Western ""Dances with Wolves"" in 1990, which he also directed, which first made him a huge international star. ""Prince of Thieves"" was his follow-up to that huge success. It is not a film on the grand epic scale of ""Dances with Wolves"", but that was always going to be a hard act to follow, and Costner was probably wise not to try and copy it. In some of his later films he did indeed try to recapture the grandeur of ""Dances"", with mixed results; ""Wyatt Earp"" was reasonably well received, but ""Waterworld"" was an unmitigated disaster, and although I personally liked ""The Postman"" I have to admit that I am in the minority on that one.Costner is not quite as good here as he was in ""Dances with Wolves"", although he does enough to justify his reputation as an international superstar, and he receives good support from Morgan Freeman as Azeem. (Nice to see an Arab being portrayed as one of the good guys for a change; Hollywood frequently assumes that anyone of Middle Eastern origin is a terrorist or religious fanatic). The film, however, is stolen by Alan Rickman as the evil Sheriff of Nottingham, a splendidly hissable villain in the best pantomime tradition. ""Prince of Thieves"" is not particularly deep or significant, but as a family adventure film it is a pretty good one, with some well-handled action sequences, especially the attack on the castle at the end. It is never quite as good as the Errol Flynn version, but then that film has so defined our view of Robin Hood that it is difficult for any later version to compete. I would rate it higher than the Patrick Bergin film, and certainly more higher than the disappointing ""Robin and Marian"". (I have not yet seen Ridley Scott's recent effort). 7/10"
160,"I really like this movie, even looking past Costner's quickly discarded accent, and so when I was shopping for movie last week and came across this extended version I quickly purchased it in hopes of indulging in one of my favorites from my teens. Unfortunately, while the extended footage was a welcome addition (much of it deals with the Sheriff's past and his relationship with Mortiana, the witch) I found several key pieces of dialogue from the theatrical version missing from the extended version of the film. One such missing exchange takes place when Sir Guy returns after being bested by Robin for the first time, in the theatrical version he explains to his cousin, the Sheriff, that Robin is traveling with a man who carries a Sarisan sword; this important piece of information is never presented to the Sheriff in the extended version so its a bit jarring when, in the next scene, he deduces that the painted man the witch is referring to in her vision is Robin's companion. Another important scene missing is the Sheriff's first confrontation with Robin in the Bishop's quarters. Its ridiculous that this film cuts the part where Robin gives the Sheriff a cut on his cheek, and I can't figure out if it was cut due to some sort of censorship or the editor fell asleep in the cutting room. There are several more instances of missing dialogue I found, but since its been years since I last saw this film and not having the theatrical version to compare it to I can't be sure how much was altered for this special edition. In my opinion there is no reason to buy this version of the movie, unless you really want to see the extended scenes or the special features. The audio is sub-par for a 2nd print, special edition DVD release, the picture quality is noticeably in need of touch ups and the special features, while a pleasant addition, really don't warrant the extra cost over the theatrical release. In the end I wish I'd had bought the original cut."
161,"There are so many things I could complain about in this film - the interesting approach to English geography for starters - but I still can't help but love it.Kevin Costner is pretty good as this quintessentially English hero, but it is his supporting cast that make the movie. Morgan Freeman is great, Nick Brimble is perfect as Little John, with Soo Drouet wonderful as his wife Fanny (""I've given birth to eight babies. Don't you talk to me about getting' hurt""). Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio plays Marian with spirit and Christian Slater is a great Will Scarlett. But it is the villains that make this film so utterly enjoyable. Michael Wincott and Geraldine McEwan provide superbly hissable support as Guy of Gisborne and Mortiana respectively, but the film truly belongs to Alan Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham. He gets most of the best lines (""Locksley, I'm going to cut your heart out with a spoon"", ""Call off Christmas!"" etc) and a fantastic battle scene culminating in a wonderfully drawn out and dramatic death.The film mixes humour, romance and action very well, and I defy anyone not to be swept along by the story, from the opening brawl in a Jerusalem prison to the wedding finale, attended by an oddly Scottish Richard the Lionheart. Overall verdict - cheesy but excellent!"
162,I think Kevin costner is a wonderful actor.hes good-looking and the characters he plays are charisma and confidence.The only reason i watched prince of thieves is because i enjoyed dances with wolves.Heres what i loved about Robin hood prince of thieves.The films score was breathtaking.It was a beautiful piece of music.Alan rickman as the sheriff was great.Rickman portrayed a very dark sinister sheriff.One thing that i hated about this film was kevin costners American accent.Robin Hood is supposed to be English and for some reason costner has this horrible American accent.I found that to be very insulting to the Robin hood franchise.The setting of the film was very dull and gloomy.It showed england at its worst.The film has a lot of good action scenes but its also a very boring film.I don't think Prince of thieves is a bad film i just don't think its the best robin hood adaption.
163,"I can't say that Robin Hood has ever really been one of my favorite fables and this Hollywoodised version only succeeds as a humorous re-imagining of the tale and not really as a serious attempt at making a film version. The anachronistic dialogue, accent inconsistency, omissions of characters and the adding of new ones aside the film is an effective action-packed tale that keeps the audience entertained.Morgan Freeman as Azeem is one of his least charismatic roles to date. Like a medieval Spock or Data, he appears to be present to merely be the butt of racial jokes and to carry a funny (and unconvincing) accent. Alan Rickman plays the Sheriff Nottigham in a ridiculously over-the-top manner, turning him into more a caricature of a villain than a serious antagonist.The films simplified narrative and comic-tint work against it as a serious film, but will no doubt provide endless enjoyment to the masses."
164,"This Version of Robin Hood is much darker & more brooding than the 1938 Classic. It is much longer too with a lot less swash buckling & more depth. The film maker here tries to show off some of the newer special effects in the fight sequences. Trouble is when compared to the 1938 classic, while it is different, it is not better.While the cast is good, this film is not as uplifting as the classic though it tries to make up for that at the very end with an UN-credited cameo with Sean Connery as King Arthur. This completed the cycle for Sean as he also did a turn as Robin in Robin & Marion.The film has some well filmed scenery, but the overall story of the comrades of the group from Sherwood Forest gets lost in the mix someplace. Overall, the film is watchable, the darker brooding story attempt does distinguish it from the Errol Flynn classic. A body double is used for Costner in his bathing scene which is a sequence this film could lose as it is not really a vital part of the story as told."
165,"This film is a very entertaining, funny look at the legend of 'Robin Hood' and his merry men of Sherwood Forest. The movie never really takes itself seriously, which is a bonus to the audience, and is quite comic, with good performances all round from Kevin Costner, Morgan Freeman, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Alan Rickman and Christian Slater.None of the performers really stand out in ""Prince of Thieves"", while Pen Densham and John Watson's screenplay remains well balanced. Good action sequences compliment proceedings.Kevin Reynolds film runs over two hours, but never seems long or tiresome. One question though: Why end a period piece with a rock ballad during the final credits? Seems a bit out of place to me.Saturday, June 29, 1991 - Village DoncasterRobin Hood is a lot slower and more dull second time around. Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Alan Rickman manage to keep you interested.Saturday, July 20, 1991 - Albury Twin Cinema"
166,"This film is actually decent considering that Kevin Costner is in it. He really is a good actor, but many of his movies tank for some reason. Anyway, I really enjoyed this telling of the Robin Hood story, it made it sort of epic and really special. Instead of just a children's story, though Disney's version is fairly good as well. I think the acting in this movie was great. I love Morgan Freeman, he has such a powerful voice. He plays any roll well. I think the chemistry between cast was really strong. I also enjoyed the cinematography. The scenery was beautiful. The music was nice as well. I like how it was written; the story and script were really solid. I think this film is an unheralded classic, and if you get the chance sit down and have a viewing. You might be pleasantly surprised!"
167,"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is better than the new BBC series for several reasons, some of which are: Maid Marian is actually more spiteful and harsh than her wet BBC counterpart, the Merry Men are actually vicious dirty people rather than spotless wimps, and it actually tries to have a shocking side to it. But the quality of this film isn't hot. The battle scenes feel more like something from the 1960s (which was actually an era of good films), and there isn't much action at all. Though this film tries to build on character and plot, and actually does that far better than the BBC series, it feels so much older than its 16 years. The filmmakers were not flexible with their big budget - Braveheart had a similar one but gave us far more action and running time than this. Some of the fights are nice and the archery is neat (definitely hotter than the swordplay), but it really isn't surprising to see why this one wasn't too popular. The conclusion was lacking, and even though we did get to see Friar Tuck in this film unlike the BBC series, it could have been far better. 6/10"
168,"I first saw this film in 2005 (a while after 1991 - but I was a little baby who much preferred The Little Mermaid and Bump The Elephant!)and I admit the only reason I watched it was because my dear sweet mother forced me in front of the blessed TV. My verdict: its pretty darn good. Considering...Well, I don't mean to be rude, but why cast Kevin Costner as Robin Hood? Really - is it so hard to cast someone who can do the English accent (I heard Costner attempted it and it didn't go down too well with the director). And for god sake if you want to pick an American guy to do the lead can you please choose someone who can act? Costner is only ever Costner in his films.But I congratulate all the other actors, who did a pretty good job: Morgan Freeman, Christian Slater, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio... well done!My favourite character has got to be (don't die of shock) the Sheriff of Nottingham! Before watching this I only saw Alan Rickman in Harry Potter and although he was pretty good, I never expected that he was capable of being so amazing! His portrayal of the Sheriff is by far the best ever in the history of TV and film: if you're gonna be subtle, be subtle - but if its best to overact, GO FOR IT! And he has the best lines too, forget Kevin Costner - Alan Rickman was the star! 10/10(though if Alan wasn't in it I'd probably say 2!) *WARNING*: Since watching Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves I have become an Alan Rickman fan. If you are unwilling to be mesmerised by how sexy and how amazing an actor he is DO NOT WATCH! Don't watch any of his films in fact, because believe me you will become OBSESSED! I've only just started getting over the fact that I can't find the damn video! My heart is mending, though - ever so slowly."
169,"Far from ideal, but still entertaining in its own right comes this rendition of the beloved and classic adventure tale. Having spent years away in battle, skilled young archer Robin of Locksley (Costner) returns to his homeland to find it ruled under the tyranny of the evil Sheriff of Nottingham (Rickman). With the help of a bothersome but resourceful moor (Freeman) and a rogue gang of woodsmen, he becomes an outlaw to not only try and thwart the Sheriff, but to claim the love of Maid Marion (Mastrantonio). A sweet, family film it's certainly not, but a rousing, action-packed adventure with a first-rate cast it certainly is, though the romantic subplot/love story never quite resonates. Well-performed, with the highlight being Rickman who steals every scene he's in. ***"
170,"This movie Robin Hood is one of common Hollywood movie which ends as a happy ending; the victory of justice, and evil becomes ruin. Yes, it is. This movie was same. But I found the one of the best heavy actor in the movie.(I'll not tell about the story because it is so famous in the West.) Robin Hood, the prince of the thieves. His adventure and story based on the love as same as romantic movies. The good men in the movie was fine; people's acting was good and their character was fit with my imagination. But there was no special and outstanding person. But, in the heavy part, there was. He was Sheriff of Nottingham as Alan Rickman. His acting and his face was full of combination. It looks as his acting is overreaction, but it cannot be blamed for it. When a movie gets success, there are three advantages; casting, music, and actor's&actress'acting. Unfortunately, this movie had sweet music, good casting, and Rickman's wonderful acting. Since I saw him, I became his one of fans."
171,"take a minute to think...no, actually, just take a few seconds and you'll realize how empty this movie would be if rickman wouldn't be there displaying his wild acting skills, with THE VOICE, Michael wincott as his right hand.yes that's right it would be just another dreadful event of Hollywood superstars playing folk legends looking like a million bucks. Kevin costner, no matter what people (or critics for that matter) say, is a good actor. the truth is this, though; he's too old and too American to play robin hood, and he never should have done it. he shouldn't have done a couple of other movies either, but that's a whole different story. Morgan freeman is Morgan freeman as always, i can't believe an actor without any kind of range can be this respected. he has the parts that fit him, like shawshank, but this wasn't one of them. Christian slater, even though he does try, is just utterly useless in this type of an adventure. Mary mastrantonio actually survives the prince of thieves despite a couple of embarrassing scenes.guy of gisborne and sheriff of Nottingham make this an entertaining movie for guys, and the ladies seem to like them as well. watch once from the beginning to the end, on further viewings just skip to the good parts and watch rickman and wincott take the rest of the cast, crush them into pieces and display their remains in the marketplace. i just wish they would collaborate again."
172,"I suppose acting is a job like any other, and it pays the mortgage, but as soon as Geraldine McEwan and Alan Rickman realised what they had regrettably got themselves into, it must have been a case of ""industrial strength gin-and-tonics all round"", personal damage limitation and, eventually and delightfully, having as much fun as possible.I don't particularly dislike Kevin Costner; it is his lack of respect for the original story which makes me extremely glad he makes himself looks such a superlative prat in this film. I'm fully aware that the blokes running around in Sherwood Forest 800 years ago didn't sound like Hugh Grant, but the point is that it's an English story with which he's taking such liberties, and he could at least have tried to do something resembling a Nottinghamshire -or even an English accent. He's an actor of some repute, it was surely not beyond his skills.....But no, he simply couldn't be arsed to change his accent, after all, it's only 60 million British people, all ""foreigners"", what the hell do their opinions matter? Hmm.Alan Rickman is far and away my favourite character in this patchy film, with Geraldine McEwan coming a breathless second, (no-one else even comes close).Rickman's rampant scene-stealage, glorious sexiness and all-round utterly sparkling knowing actorly scintillating brilliance has been expounded upon by far better critics than me. I adored his performance in this slightly crappy film. There are very good bits, mostly performances from the British actors who have a sense of history and a feel for what this story is about. The Americans, mostly, should be, (but of course won't be) ashamed of themselves. Christian Slater's perf. was quite good, though his accent was not much better than Costner's. Mary Eliz. Mastroithingy was as dull as unsalted porridge, god only knows why she was cast in this seminal feminist role.It is a good enough film, but would have been an utter heap of festering tripe without the thankfully terrific and very memorable contributions of Alan Rickman and Geraldine McEwan."
173,"Kevin Costner, joined by his faithfully grating companion, Morgan Freeman, takes all the power away from the protagonists in this otherwise solid effort. Alan Rickman and Michael Wincott are more likable, more human. While Kevin Costner goes off on his own little crusade to make the world a better place, Alan Rickman finds the nearest piece of forest and chews it. The movie around them is just as confused. This is not the Technicolor Adventures of Robin Hood, yet there are still copping from that film as the men are a too little merry. We jump from one dark and bloody scene to a tender scene with a blind man. A blind man, for God's sake! Save up from cheap tugging of heart strings. That said, there is a suitable amount of action. All of the action lives up to expectations, it is too bad that the drama couldn't have dropped the mela.Guy: ""Why a spoon cousin? Why not an ax or..."" Sheriff: ""Because it's dull, you twit, it'll hurt more!"""
174,"i loved this film so much. i really loved it. it was a feel good film. it is beautifully written and acted out amazingly.christian slater is so fit, hes gorgeous! kevin costner isn't bad either. but it is a brilliant film it is really one of the best films i have ever seen. i did cry at a bit near the end not because it was sad just because it was so moving.it reduced me to tears. it is also very funny in many places. the film is a mixture of happiness and laughter."
175,"It's hard to believe the number of positive comments this movie receives - perhaps fans are easily impressed by money and big stars chucked at a cinema screen and none-too demanding in the crucial areas of what makes a good film good?Kevin Costner must be the most un-magnetic Robin Hood ever. A monotonal, 35 year old bloke with '90s blow-dried hair, his character is so bland and demystified, the film has no intrigue. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Maid Marian is icy, sexless and presented with an absurd '90s perm, and similarly Christian Slater appears to have been spending more time with his blow-drier than in Sherwood Forest. Supposedly Alan Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham steals the show, but I was more embarrassed for him, being reduced to the level of bumbling comic relief in such a bad film.What hit me hardest was just how cheap a movie as expensive as this could be made to look: like something produced for television rather than a large screen. The camera-work is both stolid and pointlessly flashy at the same time, for despite the cameraman's using a steadicam and a variety of trick lenses to distort the picture at seemingly random inopportune moments, the focal point of each shot is resolutely dead-center in the middle of the screen. No use is made of the wide-screen image and your eyes need never wander from the subliminal TV-screen sized square in the middle of the picture.Worse than the lousy cinematography is the editing: action set pieces thrown together like a dog's breakfast, without any rhythm or flow. There are no majestic, long takes and everything is assembled from bitty cutaway shots in an inept, ""just point the camera at whatever happens and leave it for the editors to sort out"" style. There are out of focus shots, edits which cross the line so characters facing one direction appear to jump to facing the other, and even cuts halfway through a zoom: this is a textbook example of how NOT to edit a movie. Just as bad is the overall pacing of the film: the total lack of any time passage gets very tedious, everything seems to happen during the same afternoon; the lack of any pace or flow to the narrative makes it feel way too long.There were some good bits... the score was stirring, and it's a huge relief that the  film doesn't take itself too seriously. Especially amusing was the scene where Marian spies on Robin, nude, taking a shower in a forest waterfall. The sets look like they've had a lot of work gone into them, but the treehouses made me think ""Ewok village"", sorry.Add the woeful geographical conceits (everywhere in England is within a two-mile radius, apparently) that rotten pop song (number one for nine weeks - oh the humanity!!) the hacked-up plot and missing characters (Prince John?) and you have a pointless, empty mess of a film. Pure Hollywood junk of the worst kind."
176,"When young nobleman Robin of Locksley returns home from the crusades, he finds that his father has been killed and his land stolen by the Sheriff of Nottingham. He takes refuge in Sherwood forest, where he joins up with a group of bandits. Gradually he melds them into a cohesive unit and together they attempt to overthrow the Sheriff, who plans to marry Maid Marion (King Richard the Lionheart's cousin), and thereby claim the throne of England for himself during the King's absence.I watched this for the first time over the Easter weekend. I never had any great desire to see it on its theatrical release, and the only time that I attempted to watch it on television I gave up about half an hour in as it was so dark and murky. That was about 10 years ago, so when a friend at work offered to lend me the new DVD I gratefully accepted. To see it in digitally remastered form on 32"" of flatscreen, and hooked up to a meaty amp/surround system was like watching a different film. While still dark by design and slightly gloomy in tone, overall I found it most enjoyable. Kevin Costner is fine as Robin, if a little bland, and Alan Rickman does his best pantomime villain as the Sheriff. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is a fiesty Marion and best of all is Morgan Freeman as Robin's Moorish friend Azeem, proving once again that he's one of the finest screen actors of recent years. The production is lavish, and the set pieces are thrilling and well executed. The pace and script is rather leisurely (although this version contains 12 minutes of extra footage mainly dealing with the Sheriff), but that serves to highlight the action. Finally, Michael Kamen provides a rousing score as a backdrop. As a side note, I found the sense of geography rather amusing. Robin lands at the White Cliffs of Dover, declares that they will celebrate with his father that night (nearly 200 miles away), then sets off via Hadrian's wall in Northumbria! However, this film isn't intended as a serious historical document and such inaccuracies are easy to forgive. It's an old fashioned romp with some '90's trimmings, and viewed as such is very entertaining."
177,"There are a lot of problems with this movie, the understanding of England in this period is best summed up by the DVD documentary unashamedly using the phrase 'Merry Olde England' about half a dozen times and the movie has Sean Connery as Richard the Lionheart.... (oh dear) It is not so much Costners accent that is the problem per se he just seems a bit of a wimp as does Will Scarlet, these two are in a different movie than the rest of the Merry men are in or Alan Rickman.However there is something very fun about this movie, it has a great stirring soundtrack, Morgan Freeman's character is a token PC creation i admit but at the same time he is great with wonderful moments and lines that really make the movie. Alan Rickman and the witch are great crowd pleasing devices. But the movie revels in what it is, a rather corny epic and there is no shame in that."
178,"There's been a lot of bad comments about this film, so I just had to give my opinion. I won't be here long, don't worry.Just to start, I think this is a great movie. Why? Because it's funny, it's fast-paced, and you don't have to think too much to enjoy it. (Also, there's a definite smell of the cheddar about it... ""I have a brother!"") As long as you don't take the movie seriously and you don't expect to be seeing something intelligent, then it's enjoyable. Alan Rickman is (once again) a fantastic villain, and... well, Kevin Costner isn't that bad.My point is (there's one there somewhere), is that Prince Of Thieves may not be a ""good"" movie, but it's a fun and enjoyable one all the same. I can ignore the odd plot loop as long as I enjoy watching it.So, to resort to a rubric, I give it seven out of ten... but only four out of ten if you wanted it to be a serious movie."
179,"This film is totally BRILLIANT! All the action secens Are BRILL and the film is hillarious! Kevin Costner is very good in this film and so is Morgan Freeman together they make the film unforgetable. And we couldn't forget Guy Of Gisbourne he is also a brilliant actor because he plays his part well as a scumbag! And i also have to say that 15 year old Daniel Newman (Wulf) is GORGEOUS and CUTE!! but i have to say he looks alot younger in the film. I give this film 10/10 for its action, great dialog and for its unforgetable comedy! I'll be watching it over and over again!!!"
180,"Sure ""Robin Hood"" won't be remembered for it's acting or it's script, but that's okay. At least Kevin Costner, despite the accent, delivers with an exciting and different look at medieval times and the ""Robin Hood"" legend. Great characters is what makes this movie fun. From Morgan Freeman's 'Azeem' to Michael McShane as 'Friar Tuck' everyone is great (except for maybe Christian Slater). Yeah, Alan Rickman overacts a bit as 'Nottingham', but at least he tries something different instead of playing the same bad guy he did in ""Die Hard"". Also, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is HOT as 'Marion'. Don't avoid this movie because of Costner's acting because it's definitely not bad enough to detract from the action.7 out of 10 for ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"""
181,"http://us.imdb.com/Title?0102797 out at the same time I think the Bergin version is a touch more believable for its lack of Hollywood treatment; though both films ultimately fall short of ever actually being worth the film they wasted making them.Binding the two films together might have achieved a greater whole, certainly Rickman (master of baddies) is the superior evil guy - in general the Prince of Thieves cast is superior in every way apart from Costner - at which point Bergin at least lends a little authenticity to the role.Worth watching because it's the superior spectacle, but is ultimately soulless which is where the other version comes in."
182,"To all those who say this is the best version of the Robin Hood story- Hang your heads in shame - It's utter garbage - apart from Alan Rickman & Morgan Freeman (who as a another commenter put it does look a little out of place). Kevin Costner produces one of his worst performances yet (almost as bad as Waterworld - shudders). He's outacted by the scenery - more wooden than Sherwood Forest. Alan Rickman steals every scene he's in, playing Nottingham ever so slightly OTT - but it works - casting Christian Slater as Will Scarlett was also a bad move but at least his character is more animated than Costner's Robin. Yeah, Men In Tights was a much better film.But for the definitive Robin Hood fil/show watch HTV's Robin Of Sherwood - made in the 80's did a much better job of telling both versions of the story than this does of telling the nobleman's version."
183,"(contains spoilers)Besides the fact that Kevin Costner could only attempt a British accent, his portrayal of Robin Hood was adequate for the film.  I honestly felt nothing as he fell from the flaming rope to his supposed doom, but that may have been because of the common knowledge that the good guy almost always wins.I truly cried, however, at the Death scene of the Sheriff.  He was the one character that was so perfectly portrayed as to draw the audience into the story.  Alan Rickman pulled off another beautifully evil villain, while keeping it somewhat light-hearted by portraying George as a fool blinded by rage.Christian Slater and the rest of the merry men give an outstanding performance and polish off the genuine feel of the forest, Michael McShane was the perfect man to play the drunken sidekick of Friar Tuck, and Morgan Freeman is unforgettable as the moor Azeem.I give this film 7/10."
184,"I am one of those movie-watchers who is pretty picky about what he wants to spend his time viewing--I almost solely enjoy only Top Quality movies.There are occasions when the craftsmanship behind a movie is not excellent by any means, but it's not ""B"" quality, either.  If you read my other reviews, you'll see that I do sometimes heartily recommend other movies that, like this one, are very good but not excellent.  Such is the case here. I just purchased the DVD of this movie.  I had rented it about three times in the past decade, and have always found it to provide what many of us hope for in a movie:  Solid Entertainment!  6.5/10BTW, the soundtrack is well-worth purchasing.  (10/10)   It's great for background music b/c the loud instrumentation is never too loud, nor are the quiet portions too quiet.  And then there are the two great vocal tracks at the -end- of the disc (where they should almost Always be on soundtracks with this much instrumental music)--one of them ""Everything I Do"" performed by Bryan Adams!  A perennial radio favorite.  And that track has an extra tag to the song that is never played on the radio: If you like the song, you'll find it to be sonically gorgeous."
185,"To say the least, I was disappointed the first time I watched this movie, and shut it off 3/4 of the way through. But what you really need to do when watching this is to give it time, and just sit through it and follow the plot.It has a rather touching story, and although Kevin Costner isn't one of my favorite actors, I still thought he did a pretty good job. Yes, his accent did fluctuate but I don't think this took away from the movie too much.What made the movie a better experience for me was the appearance of Christian Slater as Will Scarlett. I personally have an avid love for Christian Slater, so seeing him in this was certainly a treat. His character has a bit of a hot temper and adds to the fun of the movie. And you just gotta love that long hair..."
186,"The modern day interpretation of ye olde tale of those fearless folk of the forest going about robbing the rich, and giving to the poor is basically a very enjoyable romp. The story holds up well, jauntering along at a steady speed, with plenty of laughs a la Rickman along the way. The much argued over 'American Robin Hood' provides a decent performance - almost award winning if compared to the  one Mr Costner  recently produced. Of course, it pushes the bounds of reality more than ever so slightly to try and get the audience to believe this man with his disgustingly visible tan lines, as he steps out from a swim in the waterfall, really got so brown in the English countryside. His American drawl remains but possibly to the benefit of the film, as his strange attempt at what can only be described as Mockney, whilst shrouded in his poop covered sheet before the attempted rescue scenes, truly is the worst since Dick-Van-Dyke in Mary Poppins. In addition, it's difficult to see which English actor could really have been cast for the part way back in 1991. The need for a well-established star to lead the film would have been crucial and the lack of known English talent at the time was pitiful. Morgan Freeman does well in a role that doesn't really test him very much. The viewer gets the feeling that this is just a film he's doing to bide the time with until something juicy and actually worthy of his abilities comes along. The star of the show, undoubtedly, is Alan Rickman. Pantomime baddies rarely come any better, and his enthusiasm as the Sheriff of Nottingham exudes from every sharp one-liner sprinkled throughout the film. That, and his wonderfully over zealous running around the shop as things gradually deteriorate are reason alone to watch the film. The love interest is played adequately by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, whilst Christian Slater isn't needed at all. Anyone else - possibly even an 'unknown' English actor - could have carried his part with their hands tied behind their back. However, Hollywood execs rule so another 'established' American star gets in and makes things that bit more unbelievable. Nevertheless, the rarely mentioned supporting cast does a fantastic job of convincing the audience that these people really are part of the legend of Sherwood Forest. It really is a 'Who's-Who' of cheap British television actors thrown together, mixed over a steady heat, with quite a good result at the end of it. Trying to remember the shows they were in proves a game in itself, when the endless character-building claptrap our Robin keeps coming out with gets a bit much. Kevin Reynolds redeems himself with this effort, a few years before the 'less-said-about-the-better' Waterworld. His direction makes the most of the forest backdrop, and the English countryside, whilst the castle scenes are suitably dimly lit without making the whole thing seem too serious. If you've never seen it, get it out or catch it on telly next time. Don't stress too much over the inconsistencies and shortcomings - that'll just spoil what is, in essence, a nice little Sunday evening flick. Rollicking fight scenes, a nice splattering of comedy and a few Hollywood heavyweights thrown in for the hell of it. Robin Hood's certainly come a long way. And all without a single pair of green, leg-hugging tights in sight."
187,"This film was a classic example of what could have been but wasn't.  The movie was obviously trying way to hard too be the modern defining film of its genre.  Star Wars succeeded in the space-fantasy genre, Raiders of the Lost Ark succeded in the pulp action / adventure genre, and Willow failed at being the same in the heroic fantasy genre.  This movie is trying to be the definitive updating of Robin Hood, and suffers from being excessively earnest and taking itself waaaay too seriously.  (For a great example of a recent attempt that succeeded beautifully, check out The Mask of Zorro.)The movie isn't without redeeming features.  Alan Rickman is always fun to watch and makes the most with whatever he's given.  Morgan Freeman does a good job.  Seeing Sean Connery in a cameo was enjoyable enough.  But yes, Costner's California accent in Medieval England is tough to swallow.There are worse ways to spend a few bucks at the video store, but keep your expectations fairly low."
188,"Michael Wincott was the only saving grace in this film. Call this basic folkloric knowledge, but Robin Hood did not have an American accent. Couldn't ever call this a drama, but would willingly classify it as a comedy ! Ha ha."
189,"I dont know what irritated me more in this film; Kevin Costner's constant mumbling or the some of the slips they made in the plot and filming. For example, there is a scene that shows Robin and his Merry men melting metal over a CAMPFIRE to make arrowheads and swords. I know Robin was resourceful and cunning, but you cant make tempered steel without a forge, and where did they GET the raw ore to begin with? I never saw a mine in  Sherwood forresst. I like Costner, I really do, and I think Morgan Freeman is a GREAT actor. But this film should make them BOTH want to run and hide in a forresst.4/10"
190,wasnt that bad. Kevin Costner played a really strong role in it. And Morgan Freeman played a excellent role also. This movie had good scenes and boring scenes. But i rate this movie a 5. I think people who enjoy Mideval movies would like this one..
191,"1... Alan Rickman gets a lot of good press here and he deserves it. Beyond the villainy he portrayed so well in 'Die Hard', his sheriff is the ultimate pantomime baddie. And he steals every scene he is in.2... Don't knock Costner. In any version of Robin Hood (including the Disney cartoon) Robin is the least interesting character. The cast assembled around him are the people we remember. Even Flynn (memorable because he was Flynn) was victim to this. (Rathbone, again, was a villain par none).3... This is a very, very enjoyable movie. Yes it has little faults. The secret is just sit down, watch it, get into it and have a great time. One to watch again and again."
192,"Why does Robin Hood arrive in England in what appears to be Kent, walk to Northumberland for a hike along Hadrian's Wall before ending up at a castle in Wiltshire???? Location is quite an important aspect to a ""historical"" film, so perhaps using one of the most famous landmarks in the UK and calling it Nottingham was a poor choice? I am the only one (at least in Britain) who noticed?"
193,"I liked this film mainly because of the scene when lord locksley goes out of his castle and fights all the other guys, this scene is just class and makes me love the film. I also thought that Alan Rickman was really good in it. I had no idea what Morgan Freeman was doing in it, but he pulled off a good preformance so i wont ask questions. As for Costner i think he was good enough for the role. Overall 9 out of 10"
194,I've seen this film tons of times over the years and still love watching it. I must have been about six or seven the first time I saw this film and a couple of months ago I bought it on DVD. I think it's perfect Sunday viewing. I'm not exactly Kevin Costner's biggest fan but I like him in this film. Morgan Freeman is great and as a huge Christian Slater fan how could I not enjoy his great performance? This is a lot of fun and it gets 8 1/2 outta 10 from me.
195,"Though loosely based on the 19 century pennings of Robert Pyle, ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" takes the poorman's King Athur, and destroys his legend. At least Hollywood paid tribute to the popularity of the legend, and true to the essence of the legendary figure, his panache and charisma through folklore was reenforced by casting the likesof Errol Flynn as that heroic character. Kevin Costner pales in the shadow of the fallen nobleman he portrays. Surrounded by a very talented supporting cast, good scripting, killer soundtrack, and powerful photographic images of actual locations, he again shows that ""Midas Touch"". The chemistry created by all of the above carries the viewer along with it, preventing one from letting his mind tell him to get up and leave the theatre or turn off the TV. I cannot explain why this all works, but it does, and very well. ""It's got a great beat and it's easy to dance to"""
196,"I think this is just one of the best Robin Hood movies out there.  It just really makes the story of Robin Hood enjoyable, better than all the rest. Kevin Costner and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio have a great chemestry.  What I also thought was a good touch to the movie was the Bryan Adams song, ""Everything I do(I do it for you)"" it really gave it a nice ending to the movie.  All the characters did well to make you belive they were part of Robin Hood's men and just part of the movie and time in history.  I just really liked this movie and hope more poeple will see it, I know I have been watching it for years now."
197,"Like I said, just don't think about it, and it's great.  There are some screw-ups in it, and Kevin Costner as Robin Hood?  But other than that it was actualy a good adventure. The film begins in Jerusilum, I think, during the Crusades.  Robin of Locksley (Kevin Costner) escapes for a prison with the help of his new-found companion Azeem (Morgan Freeman).  He returns to England to find his father murdered by the sheriff of Nottingham (Alan Rickman).  Robin vows revenge, becomes an outlaw, and creates his famous ""merry"" men. There are some things about this film that are kinda' annoying, but you forget about them.  A couple of the lines are corny, but thats it.  To get down to the meat of this review: RICKMAN IS GOD!!!!!  He performs his role flawlesly.  I loved every second he was on.  That kind of role is very easy to screw up, but he did it as if it was nothing! Any-who, I recomend this to anyone who doesn't like to disect films, and point out mistakes, you know, knitpickers.I give ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES 7/10"
198,"This show has action & romance, life & death, good & evil which when added up makes a memorable show indeed from the soothful voice of Bryan Adams in the background crooning how he 'robin hood' would do anything for the woman he loves & HAH! the bad guy comes in the form of a law-enforcer & the 'thief' is the hero...Kevin Costner can steal me any day!!!"
199,"I liked this movie.  I like most movies about the middle ages and thought that they did a good job unromantizing the era like more Robin Hood movies do.  I just have to ask one thing...Why do some people not like this movie because of its realism?  I thought that the opening scene was great in portraying the disgusting religious piety of the European nobles during the high middle ages (crusades). Morgan Freeman's Muslim character was a great touch.  I say yes for a realistic Robin, forget Roger Ebert, check this movie out."
200,"When I asked for this movie on my Christmas list this year, it met with some pretty shocked looks from friends and family members.  Not that I blame them all that much either, since it's unlike just about everything else in my movie collection.  What they failed to see, however, was the simple fact that the reason I wanted the movie had absolutely nothing to do with the traditional reasons (I'm not all that fond of Kevin Costner).  I wanted it simply for Alan Rickman who does a FANTASTIC job as the Sheriff of Nottingham.Okay, Costner's lack-of-accent makes me to want to hit my head against the wall much of the time.  With everyone else's accents, it is as annoying as sin.  And we all know that he can do accents - Thirteen Days is a perfect example.  It just seemed like laziness on his part.The arrow shot spined my head a little, but it was a neat concept.  The woodland scenes were very well done - showing the fairytale atmosphere coupled with poverty, making one want to live there and not live there simultaneously.I can make nice comments for Morgan Freeman, Christian Slater (that little plot twist was a neat idea), Michael McShane as Friar Tuck, and Nick Brimble, who made an ideal Little John.  Michael Wincott also deserves some applause for his role as Guy of Gisbourne, though it once again leaves you wondering if he is EVER going to play a good guy.That leaves Rickman.  As I looked at the comments that came before mine, it seems that just about everyone was in agreement - Rickman is great.  It's not that he does a wonderful acting job, or that he makes you sympathize with a poor, misunderstood villain (that was definitely NOT his intention). What he does so amazingly well, is play the role as the befuddled, sex-crazed bad guy.  His pompous attitude is right on target, as is his just-slightly-over-acted-to-make-it-hilarious outrage towards Kevin Costner's Robin.  He saw the opportunity and he took it and I, for one, applaud him for it.Final notes - Rickman's performance is worth seeing, no matter what."
201,"Alright, first and foremost, for all those who wanted to be picky, there is nothing wrong with Kevin Costner's accent! every movie has its gliches, and hes not perfect, so let it go. but with regards to Mr. Costner, this was one of the best films ive seen him in. i gotta hand it to him, he was born to play an action hero, and Robin hood is just the perfect hero, isnt he? the rest of the cast was just as magnificent. Morgan Freeman was terrific; it was a great role for him and i cant think of anyone better to play the part. Alan Rickman has never been funnier, even in Dogma he wasnt this funny!The very-good-looking Christian Slater did a great job, adding his talent to the movie, and Ive never seen him look better. Cudos go out to the entire cast. i recommend this movie for those who like a good action film like me, and who wont pick it apart for its flaws......"
202,"This film is anything but boring. It's a great film about the battle between good and evil, and the desire to overcome hardship and emerge victorious.There has been so much grumbling about the film's historical inaccuracy, but the whole story of Robin Hood is a legend. It is not a documentary. It is like a fairy tale, where the time period does not matter as much as the outcome of the story.
Morgan Freeman, playing Robin's Moorish companion Azeem, was fantastic. The film could have easily been called ""Azeem the Moor"", because his role was so significant. He and Kevin Costner make a terrific on-screen duo. Alan Rickman was great as the wicked Sheriff of Nottingham, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio was perfect for the role of the noble, yet feminine Maid Marian.Perhaps the only weak point of this film is Kevin Costner himself. His accent does not matter at all, because it is his portrayal of the character that leaves much to be desired. He appears depressed, when the legend of Robin Hood describes the character as one with an enthusiastic love for life. However, this does not dramatically affect the overall outcome of the movie - it's still a great film.With the beautiful scenery, excellent costumes, and witty dialogue, this film provides two hours of great entertainment."
203,"The movie opens up with Costner coming out of a man hole cover on some street.  I never knew there were man hole covers during the middle ages. Maybe that's what sparked the Renaissance?   I kept waiting for Costner to say ""Tatonka"" from his Dances with Wolves movie or John Cleese to come out shouting ""bring out your dead"".   At least that would've made the script better.  If you have a tape copy of Costner's Robin Hood, wait until the Errol Flynn version is on television and copy it over the Costner tape."
204,"Being a huge Kevin Costner fan, I love this movie for much more than his brilliant performance:  it's the story, the setting, the music and costumes, perfect casting (who but Alan Rickman could play a better Nottingham!) and great cinematography.It's the movie I watch when I need to be reminded of the magic in this world.P.S. Is it me or did Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio run up the stairs with Alan Rickman flashing a naked butt?  I only noticed this while seeing the movie for perhaps the 10th time - it still surprises me..."
205,"Far from brilliant, lets make no mistake on that point, but a watch-able and 'interesting' re-interpretation. A somewhat ecletic mix of acting styles, which was most particularly noticeable in the complete lack of affinity Costner displayed with the wider cast. On this point, it was not Costner's accent which upset, but rather the overt arrogance and nauseating moralism which were accentuated in his otherwise fairly bland reading of the character. The character of 'Azeem', effectively portrayed by Freeman, represents a brave interpolation of the 'myth.' However, the inclusion of Azeem tended to underplay the Robin-Little John relationship, which only served to widen the almost tangible gulf, that was ever present, between Costner and his 'Merry Men'/Social Inferiors. Secondly, Freeman's superior subtlety and nuance, had the unwanted side affect of eclipsing Costner's Robin Hood, who by contrast seemed a somewhat hapless figure. Otherwise credible performances by the rest of the cast, was somewhat marred by the the lamentably poor performances on show from Slater and Wincott 'respectively'. Wincott in particular was quite frankly absurd with his unique blend of Machievellian/Disney-esque villainy. Similarly, I could not help but feel that Rickman was OTT and the character Mortianna was a superfluous (and tedious)venture into the occult. Otherwise, I actually enjoyed this 'Medieval romp',  the music was atmospherically used, the settings were glorious and the battle sequences were suitably fulfilling if somewhat shallow. Perhaps the pacing, was, at times lethargic, and the plot somewhat predictable; the 'epic sword fight conclusion', a cliche in itself, was ultimately a somewhat bathetic affair. But these are minor criticisms in what is a genuinely watchable, (and if you can wince/cringe through Connery's all too predictable cameo), and thoroughly enjoyable film.***1/2 /*****"
206,"OK, I haven't read through all the comments yet, but just in case it hasn't been mentioned: Kevin Costner's accent is a non-issue. If Robin Hood did exist, and was a contemporary of Kings John and Richard, he would have spoken middle-English, which probably sounded much more foreign from a modern British accent than Kevin's American accent does. If we were to insist that the accents be ""authentic,"" it would likely be hard to understand by today's audiences on either side of the Atlantic. Try reading Chaucer in the original middle-English if you want to get a feel for what I mean. So to fault the movie for not achieving that kind of authenticity is misguided."
207,"You know what I'm talking about; ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" starring Errol Flynn. Comparing that classic film with this Costner drek is like comparing ""Road Warrior"" with......""Water World""? The Flynn version is fun and light hearted. Costner's version is only pandering to modern sensibilities.C'mon, the movie reeks of political correctness Maid Marion fighting in black armor? Great a strong female character, Morgan Freeman as Robin's sidekick? Hey, the wise token ethnic character.(Sorry Morgan,you were good, but unnecessary)Christian Slater? Stick him in for more youth appeal. If you must watch it, fast forward through any parts that don't feature Morgan Freeman or Alan Rickman."
208,"robin hood is just the kind of movie that errol flynn would do. it's a great cape and sword movie. a great homenage to errol flynn's robin hood. this movie tells the story of robin hood, with a historical support, but not forgetting the cape and sword scenes. it has beautiful cenaries and the action is non stop. it also has a lot of comedy. kevin costner is perfect in the part of robin hood, even though he doesn't have an english accent, but he's very funny and lively. morgan freeman, mary elizabeth mastrantonio and christian slater, do a fine job as robin's gang. and alan rickman is perfect as the sheriff of nottingham, he's full of sarcasm. kevin reynols does a fantastic job in directing this movie, making this movie the best robin hood feature ever put on screen. it's definitly a must see for all that like an adventure movie with swords and fights. look really carefully for sean connery at the end of the movie."
209,"this is the film of my childhood with my childhood hero Kevin costner as the famous Robin Hood. I saw it for the first time when I was just a kid and seeing it again made me reveal it.i loved it back then but now i did find it pretty dull and boring to sit through the two hours it takes for Robin to fight and be a romantic man. i have some comments though...*Morgan Freeman is wonderful. He saves all the scenes with the tired, obviously confused Costner (i know, i know- everyone comments on his accent and so do i. but it's a funny thing more than anything else.) and it's a good thing to add his character to the story.*often it's funny even though it's not meant to be. because the heroic tale is pretty hilarious, and so is the fact that Robin and his men are able to do anything but rumling around in the woods.*Alan Rickman saves it all with his classic performance as the hysterical and sarcastic sheriff of Nottingham. i love this guy, i'm so chocked he isn't the biggest star of them all! as soon as you see him in this film you smile because you know you'll be entertained.*the hilarious rape scene is something extraordinary. the only time i really really laughed during this pretty dull and not to worth seeing film. and that comment says a lot about this.you wont die if you miss it and if you loved it as a kid, please- don't spoil the memories by seeing it again!"
210,"Don't get me wrong, I love this film.  It really is superb and the all star cast make it even better.  But the point that has been annoying me for years is this....There are plenty of great British actors.  Why did most of the leading cast have to be American?  I can happily say Morgan Freeman is fine (he plays a moor after all, not a Brit) and at least Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio speaks with a Brit accent.  But as for Kevin and Christian. Couldn't they even attempt it?  Having a couple of Americans just didn't fit in."
211,"I Can't Say enough good things about this film, DEFINETLY on my top 5 favorite movies EVER!At the time this movie was released many ""critics"" were obsessed on two things: 1- that Costner's accent was nowhere to be found and 2- that if it wasn't for Alan Rickman the film would have no value. I remember the British press saying that the British actors saved the movie, meaning of course not only Rickmans performance but G.Mcewan as Mortiana, B. Blessed as Lord Locksley And N. Brimble as Little John to name a few and I Guess they had a point. Whatever the case it was and still is a GREAT MOVIE!I Thought Costner was good not only in a dramatic capacity but humorous as well. M. Freeman was well, GREAT as always. M.E. Mastrantonio ""IS MAID MARION"", she did a superb job as the not so helpless maiden.And of course all though he is in the movie for about 4 mins, Sean Connery is AWESOME as King Richard!Again, this is a GREAT MOVIE and as one before me has said: Swashbuckling Medieval Adventure at its Finest..."
212,"This is my favourite Robin Hood movie, even better than Errol Flynn's. The suspense was excellent, and the depiction of the common people added an appearance of realism absent from other Robin Hood films. The addition of Morgan Freeman as Azeem worked particularly well. Of course it was completely unhistorical, but so is the rest of the Robin Hood story (the real Robin was not born until after King Richard died). The biggest problem is that Freeman is such a brilliant actor that Costner was totally outclassed."
213,"Although I wasn't crazy about this movie, I think it is something everyone should see at least once.  It isn't that bad.  The biggest flaw in this movie is that it never stops being a movie.  The sign of a great film is the ability of the audience to become engrossed in the story.  All of the elements (actors, props, scenery, and most importantly, the SCREENPLAY) should work together to captivate the audiences attention.  Perhaps it's just me, but I never ""became"" a part of this movie -- I simply could not get into it.  I felt I was always sitting on my couch watching a rental that wasn't worth my $3.50, when I ought to have felt I was there in Sherwood Forest fighting the evils of corrupt injustice. Most of the fault lies with the lousy screenplay. When Kevin Costner and Morgan Freeman broke into their thesis on the essence of freedom, love, and good vs. evil, it was as if they were reading from poorly written cue cards. Kevin Costner's complete lack of a British accent didn't bother me nearly as much as his total lack of emotional bond with his character.  He didn't seem to like Robin, or seem to be familiar with the tone of the story at all.  His Robin of Locksley was bland, cold and downright grouchy.  Didn't seem to help the poor all that much either, just shot a lot of arrows into the woods and hung around with the future-cast of Braveheart. On the other hand, Alan Rickman obviously liked his character (which is why his is the best performance in the film).  Any movie he's in is worth your time and trouble to see.  Most of his zaney one-liners would have been positively lame if anyone else had said them, but he is able to turn lousy jokes into hilarious ones through mannerisms and facial expressions.   He is the only reason this movie was entertaining, and why I recommend watching this film."
214,"Robin Hood : Prince of Thieves is a great film. Fun and Fast. The true nature of the Robin Hood story. I know that Costner couldn't manage an English accent, but at least he used Ye' olde English dialect. The film isn't accurate, nor is it supposed to be. As I said before, the film is Fast and Fun, a light hearted tale of Good against Evil. The setting is incidental, it is the spirit of the film that is important. If you want a accurate account of Britain, try Monty Python and the Holy Grail instead. It's much closer to the mark."
215,"This is a film I have seen over and over again. I'm not saying I don't recognize it's flaws. It has some. But not as many as is sometimes thought. First, since that's what everybody's thinking of: The accent. Get a grip! English accents wouldn't be any more ""right"", even Shakespearan English would be a beastly anachronism. In the 12th century, English looked nothing like what it does today, even ""chair"" was a foreign word. So, an Oxbridge actor is still way wrong (sorry, Elwes, I do love you). And a film in accurate English would be silly. So, let's leave this subject. As for the other anachronisms -big deal! As if films are usually very accurate. Sadly, Costner's problem isn't his accent but his acting, which is harder to do anything about. He is so dull! Fortunately, lots of other people are not. Morgan Freeman is completely wonderful, Alan Rickman is the funniest bad guy of all times (including Jareth in ""Labyrinth"" and Count Rugen in ""The Princess Bride""). Christian Slater is completely lovable, even if he's not close to his performance in ""Heathers"" (he never is). In short, this is 2 hours and 15 minutes of cool adventure, if that's what you're looking for."
216,"Can I just say that Daniel Newman was great in this picture, and that it is well worth seeing it just for him!  It was one of his earlier roles, which makes it all the more spectacular, and I only wish he could get another like it - he's incredibly talented. Regarding the rest of the film, I can't see why so many people had a problem with it.  So Robin Hood doesn't go down in History as having an American accent - it doesn't stop it being good family entertainment.  And the music was unbeatable!"
217,"Costner and Slater's horrible attempts at an English accent, overly sentimental script and at times the action scenes are hard to see. Okay we got the bad stuff out of the way now on to the good.Robin Hood is what all good Summer Blockbusters should have as its target. It doesn't take itself seriously, it has some great crowd pleasing moments and critics hated it. Critics hated Independence Day and Armageddon as well but they were both fantastic.You don't go and see Robin Hood because you want a thoughful few hours. No, you want a lot of fun and you get it. Alan Rickman is the funniest bad guy you will ever see. He never takes his part seriously. Michael McShane as Friar Tuck provides a lot of laughs. Only Morgan Freeman can be said to have performed dramatically well but he always does.This movie is a success. Okay sometimes its horribly predictable but everyone knows the Robin Hood story so we have to make some allowances. This is a success and deserved all the money it made."
218,"As I read these user comments and critics' reviews, I get the feeling that many of the bad thoughts about Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves are based on the fact that Reynolds chose to portray a Medieval Legend as realistically as possible.  The Middle Ages weren't bright and happy times, with tights, feathers, and cheerful characters (i.e. Walt Disney).  Reynolds obviously wanted to make a different portrayal of a famous hero, rather than go on what countless other Robin Hood movies have done.  This Robin certainly is no Eroll Flynn, and his group of followers are anything but ""merry.""On a personal note, I would like to say that I love this movie, and I believe it is one of the better movies of the 90s.  Granted, this was probably one of Costner's worst roles - his acting is a little on the bland side - but this could probably be attributed to the script.  It was just not the right role written for him.  On the other hand, Rickman, Mastrantonio, Freeman, Slater, and others gave outstanding performances and made the movie more entertaining opposite Costner.  The cinematography is some of the best I've seen in a film; it ranks right up there with Glory, Titanic, and Braveheart (especially that scene towards the end where Robin is standing in front of a gigantic explosion, shooting a fiery arrow).All in all, I say this: If you want to see cheerful tights, feathers, and singing, watch Walt Disney's animated Robin Hood.  If you want to see a more realistic, Medieval Robin Hood, watch Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves."
219,"I know not everyone liked this movie, and I can think of a lot better films but this one was pretty good. I think this is Kevin Costner's best role (besides Dances With Wolves) I thought it was very entertaining. I would give this one a 7 out of 10"
220,"Owning both the Errol Flynn and the Costner version of this wonderful morality tale, I find the latter movie my favorite of the two.  The tongue-in-cheek performance given by Rickman gives us adults subtle lines to laugh at, while not corrupting the children.  Although the battering ram at the door, while Rickman is trying to consummate his forced marriage with Maid Marian wasn't too subtle, it made the movie worth seeing again and again.  There are throwaway lines you probably won't get the first time. The scenery is beautiful, and the sword play much more convincing than Rickman's earlier duels in 'Romeo and Juliet'.  The humor and acting is wonderful, even if Costner supposedly left much of Rickman on the cutting-room floor from envy. What a villain the sheriff is!! Stallone could learn from him as he re-makes 'Get Carter'.  This one isn't just for kids."
221,"I am extremely interested to see the comments of British viewers who were offended to see an American in the role of Robin Hood. You would not have liked Kevin Costner attempting and failing at a British accent! I didn't like Kevin Costner in this role anyway, British accent or an American drawl! He just does not exude the magnetism required of this fairy-tale role. Alan Rickman was over-the-top and amusing as the Sherrif of Nottingham, the only reason I even rented this picture in the first place! But then, I am not a Kevin Costner aficionado. I've adored Morgan Freeman since ""The Electric Company"" and seek out his pictures and I also thought Nick Brimble as ""John Little"" was outstanding. The little kid playing his son ""Wolfe"" was quite good. This picture would have been improved immensely by removing all the American actors, except Morgan Freeman, and getting British actors!"
222,"This is a very dark spin on the Robin Hood legend no tights or hats with feathers on in this version! It's entertaining though with a very good cast. The score is excellent. Freeman, as always is outstanding as the moor Azeem, Rickman provides the comic relief at times as the vile Sheriff of Nottingham, Costner, why can't the man attempt to do a British accent?? ok everyone else in the film can do it why can't he?? to me an american Robin Hood was very offputting and ruined the film a bit. But apart from that it's quite entertaining."
223,"Why anyone would want to subject themselves to the painful spectacle of Kevin Costner's acting in this movie is beyond me.  Likewise for Christian Slater.  I had to see it twice to convince myself that indeed, I was not hallucinating the first time I saw this dud.  Someone, please, please tell Kevin Costner that there is NOTHING more painful than a terrible accent. The story had potential, too bad it was ruined by the casting and alleged acting of all involved."
224,"I LOVED this version of Robin Hood.  The way it was filmed, the characters, the incorporation of wit and a sarcastic sense of humor.  And I adored all the actors.  Each one was perfect for their role.  I could not imagine anyone else playing Marian, Friar Tuck, the Sheriff, ect....All except for the most important role of all:  Robin Hood himself. 
Don't get me wrong, I don't hate Kevin Costner in everything.  His deadpan method of acting was enjoyable in Bull Durham and the like, but was just awful in this role.  The weak chin, no accent, monotone voice, and absolutely no sense of emotion pretty much ruined what could have been a truly great classic.  I still liked watching it, but it's like owning your dreamcar with a huge, non-repairable dent in it:  you want to be happy with it, but that one flaw just drives you nuts and prevents you from being totally satisfied."
225,"It bothers me so much how people are so closed-minded and cant seem to grasp the beauty and the magic of this movie.It was the first PG-13 movie that my mother ever let me see-and since I've been 6 it's been my favorite. Now don't let that stand in your way of watching it, because I have a knack for art and I know it.The movie is completely magical, and just because they didn't do the typical ""robbing the rich"" thing-then people think that it's crap. I'm here to tell you that it's not. Bad stuff happened back then-and they added it to make the movie more BELIEVABLE. Would you really believe the story if Robin just didn't like the Sheriff, and so decided to ruin his life-NO! There needed to be a REAL reason behind everything-and there was.The roles were casted unbelievably. Everything about it was magic. In my small little town-I'm the movie guru, and I know what I'm talking about-so don't waste your time reading anymore about this and get your butt out and watch the thing! Take my advice. And if you don't get it, well then, I guess I can't hold that against you-not everyone can understand the beauty of it. But maybe you will, just give it a try."
226,"It would have helped if the flat-toned Costner has fallen on one. Every time the man opens his mouth to rouse the troops, I expect to see them run the other way. Especially embarrassing is the scene where someone [Will Scarlett] asks what it's all about. As a veteran catcher of the Durham Bulls, he fit the role, but not here.I caught this on Encore the other day for the first time since it came out. Does anyone remember the hype, partly set off by the ingenious trailer where the viewer rides an arrow to its target and partly by all the articles. A film critic friend even traveled to Nottingham to give another angle. Then it hit the screen and critics found it hard to rate it more than 2-2.5 stars. I viewed it on video, humming ""Is that all there is?"" as it spooled.The British actors run rings about the Yanks, or rather Costner, and the thought strikes, 'why not someone like Branagh in the central role?' And why is Morgan Freeman giving counterpoint? Is his Greek chorus role really needed? It's an afternoon's entertainment, but could have been so much more. And were there no sunny days in old England?"
227,"This is my number one favorite movie, and it has been since I first saw it when I was 6. The cast is amazing, with all A-List actors, such as Sean Connery, Kevin Costner, and Morgan Freeman. The writing is truly amazing. And it adds depth to the story. I love the new roles of Azeem, Will Scarlett, and Mortiana. They all have amazing depth with a background of their own. We also see new colors to the legendary characters, such as Friar Tuck and Little John. The stuntwork is spectacular and the score is breathtaking. The battles are believable. And Kevin is amazing at doing his own stuntwork. I love how the story is not like the traditional version of the story. It has more depth of just ""robbing the rich."" There is a reason behind why he does what he does, which is truly remarkable how he pulls it off.Another amazement is how they did not hide things. This is how it would be in those days. There was rape,execution,Devil worshiping,etc. And they brought all of those into the movie with such truth and great acting. If anyone had any doubts about seeing this movie because of the ratings, I'm here to tell you to screw them. This movie is worth every minute that you sit and watch it. And it should be watched time and time again!"
228,"I absolutely love this film. I think the fighting sequences are very real looking and the imagery is great. Along with being an action movie, there is humor. Two of my favorite actors, Kevin Costner and Christian Slater, are amazing. I could go on and on:) Absolutely one of my favorite all-time movies!"
229,"Why is Morgan freeman in this?  Why is Costner in this, he sounds like John Wyane.  The romance and the story drags with these  2 actors.  Christan Slater in this you got to be joking!  Worst casting ever.  My sister tells me she loves this film, and I bought it for her, and I do not think she ever watched it more than once.  Forget this film. 3/10"
230,"This movie has great variety of action/adventure and romance! It brings the epic tale of Robin Hood to life with an excellent cast and brilliant script. Kevin Costner plays a great Robin Hood, despite his lack of an english accent. Morgan Freeman adds his talent to the movie which makes the movie that much better. Not to mention the gorgeous Christian Slater!"
231,"This is simply one of the greatest movies ever made. It has action, suspense, romance, drama, basically it has everything. A fantastic cast the likes of Costner, Morgan Freeman, Christian Slater etc. This film made many of the fine actors' careers though still in my eyes remains their finest performance. The familiar storyline of Robin Hood bring the whole realm of fantasy to it as well as Costner makes the role his own with you ending up worshipping him. For me though the best performance is by Englishman Alan Rickman who in my view for the bad guy role of The Sheriff Of Nottingham deserved a mountain of Oscars. It was his best display since Die Hard in which he was also superb. The film to me is like a part of my history as my brother and i know and can practically recite the entire script . It is pure genius and no matter how many times i watch it (about 30 times now), as soon as it here the amazing soundtrack by Brian Adams at the end I want to watch it all over again."
232,Some might think I must be insane but this is certainly in my top 5 of best movies. Gorgeous settings! Great acting! Lots of action! Epic love story! Beautiful soundtrack! A must see!
233,"Having watched 3 versions of Robin Hood, Errol Flynn's version, (the BEST), Russell Crowe's, and this garbage, I've come to this conclusion... American actors/actresses should not be speaking with a phony British accent. There's nothing worse than Kevin Costner trying to talk like he's English. This movie sucks.. I can't go on about how bad it is. Seeing Kevin Costner portraying Robin Hood is about as believable as Keanu Reeves playing an Englishman in Bram Stoker's Dracula. Sitting through 2 hours and watching this junk was a complete waste of my precious time.I will say that this film has a few redeeming qualities... #1: Alan Rickman always plays a good bad guy. #2: Sean Connery (although it's too bad that he wasn't in the movie for more than 5 seconds) and #3: The closing credits were by far the best part of this movie.Watch this movie if you like.. but I promise you, you're not missing anything if you don't. Your time would be more valuable if you spent all day passed out on your couch watching the Kardashians."
234,"I really liked Robin Hood:Prince of Thieves, I found it enjoyable and beautifully filmed. It is true, Kevin Costner's performance in the title role mayn't be to everyone's tastes, least of all mine, I found him too American plus I personally preferred Errol Flynn, who was born for the role. I just didn't think he was right for the character. But the performances from everyone else more than compensates, Alan Rickman, a great actor was a revelation as the villainous sheriff, and Geraldine McEwen almost unrecognisable as Mortitiana. Morgan Freeman and Sean Connery are excellent too, and Mary Elizabeth Monstratonio is very radiant as Maid Marian. There are also some beautiful camera-work, and some splendid set pieces, like the fight in Sherwood Forest. The script wasn't that bad, I particularly loved the Sheriff's ""Do you mind Robin? We've just got married!"" The music by Michael Kamen was beautiful and quite rousing. All in all, maybe not as good as the Errol Flynn film, but this is actually very enjoyable. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
235,Whatever happened to Alan Rickman's kind of villain. The one where his villainy was of the delicious kind and he didn't need any justification for his actions.
236,"I mean they had cereal and everything. This movie was all over the place back when it came out. But I never saw it back then.I thought any movie that had cereal named after it was too much. Where were the cereals named after Shawshank Redemption and Pelican Brief? But I think there are Star Wars cereals.However, thanks to Amazon Prime I get to see this very well made movie. The score by Michael Kamen is to die for, and I've heard it used in other movies. He was such a great composer.I mean, this movie was really popular, if IMDb were around back then, it would have been rated at least a 9. Everyone was talking about it, and not in any negative fashion.But then, they made CEREAL for it!That was the only reason I never saw it...But it's not as I imagined, wasn't expecting to actually like it. Now I wish I had bought at least one box of Prince of Theives cereal!I'll tell you what else from this movie that made a great impact, was the song by Bryan Adams at the end ""I do it for you"" - it was played on the radio continuously for maybe 4 years."
237,"I have been reading some comments about this movie, and most of them have been negative. They should realise that this movie is not like the normal robin hood you would watch, it is a more realistic type movie. I have to say Kevin Costner and Alan Rickman were the best casting choice ever. The Movie was executed amazing starting small then going for the big things. This movie is very underrated and it's one of the movies where you could just watch it again and again. This and ""The Bodyguard"" is Kevin's best movies"
238,"There have been several movies about our eponymous hero - played by Errol Flynn in 1938, Russell Crowe in 2010 and of course Kevin Costner in 1991. Others were average to good but, for me, these three were the best by far. Of these, Prince of Thieves was perhaps the most well rounded presentation with much action and a good deal of comedy.We had probably the best Sheriff of Nottingham ever in Alan Rickman. Whilst he did overplay the character a bit, he was mesmerising in the role. For me, he was the star of this movie, but everyone else played excellently. Costner, like Connery and Wayne before him, always plays himself, but it didn't spoil anything in this movie. A final plaudit goes to the late Geraldine McEwan as Mortiana. Who'd have thought that our own Miss Marple had once been a very convincing witch!If you haven't seen this movie yet ... do so now. You won't be at all disappointed."
239,This movie has moved me so much since i watched it for the first time.A timeless piece of movie art.Brilliantly directed.Highly inspirational.For me a perfect description of the Robin Hood legend who took from the rich and gave to the poor.In essence a story about the struggles of the working class and their desperate need for appreciation and kindness and admiration.A story about a folk hero and a legend.A story about corruption and greed.
240,"This still one of my all time favorite movies! The classic tale of Robin Hood told in a wonderfully scripted, well acted, action and adventure film. There is plenty edge of your seat action in this movie to keep you excited during and after watching the movie.Prince of Thieves has a realistic look and feel to the film. Battles are quite dirty, ugly and the times were dark - Prince of Thieves captured it quite well.Kevin Costner's Robin Hood has Errol Flynn's Robin Hood looking more like Peter Pan but both are outstanding performances and enjoyable movies in their own right! If you enjoyed Prince of Thieves as much as I then you may like Errol Flynn's more colorful, light-hearted version of the tale ""The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938)"".9/10"
241,"Robin of Locksley (Kevin Costner) followed King Richard the Lionheart in the Third Crusade. He's captured and imprisoned by the Muslims. He managed to escape with the help of the Moor Azeem (Morgan Freeman). Now Azeem is honor bound to remain with Robin until he can save his life. Sheriff of Nottingham (Alan Rickman) kills Robin's father and puts the people under his despotic rule. Even Maid Marion (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) can't help, and Robin must escape into the forest where he joins a group of bandits.As long as nobody takes it too seriously, there is some swashbuckling fun to be had. Alan Rickman does his best to raise the camp quota. He chews up the scenes every time he's on screen. Michael Wincott does a good turn as the evil henchman. Kevin Costner is a bland problem. He walks through this movie without trying too hard. Morgan Freeman does an accent that I can't quite pinpoint. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio doesn't have enough screen time to bring any heat or chemistry with Robin. And Christian Slater plays a very awkward modern character. But like I said, don't take it too seriously and you might enjoy bits and pieces of this movie. Just not the whole film."
242,"Can i sum up this 13 award winning 17 nomination fable story to film in one word yes *Brilliant* With an on form Costner,Morgan Freeman,Alan Rickman and alas lets not forget cameos from Brian Blessed and Sean Connery this story is greatly put together from my youth to the present watching this film never gets old. Which i think the joyous soundtrack has apart to play who can forget Bryan Adams 16 week chart topper. From bed knobs & Broomsticks to Avatar for me Robin Hood will always stand out. So if you want to see a classic or a film to take you back to your youth this is the one and if you asked me to sum it up two words Booming Brilliant."
243,"ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES, a medieval romp of wenches, women, warriors, wild men and the woods, is, taken at face value, an old-fashioned crowd-pleaser of a film. It's a deliberate throwback to the days of THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, featuring a tough, swashbuckling hero, a rich tapestry of a storyline bringing together all of the clich√©s, and plenty of action for archery fans to enjoy. It also happens to be packed full of errors, both geographical and factual, and it features some of the cheesiest performances outside of a local pantomime. That's part of the charm.First off, this isn't a film to be taken seriously. From the moment Robin washes up in Dover and announces that he'll be in Nottingham by nightfall, you know that getting the historical details right wasn't the priority of the scriptwriter. The detour to Hadrian's Wall en route is still unintentionally hilarious, and the mumbo-jumbo pagan cult stuff is just as out of place as the presence of the lost boys in Ridley Scott's po-faced take on the myth, ROBIN HOOD.But along the way, ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES is a lot of fun. Yes, it's nonsense, but it's entertaining tosh and I for one was thoroughly enjoying myself while I watched it. Okay, so Costner's gruff seriousness grates more than a little, as does the vomit-inducing romantic sub-plot with Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's wishy-washy Maid Marian, but at least Alan Rickman and Michael Wincott get into the spirit of things with delightfully over-the-top villainous turns that belong, yes, in a pantomime.Goodness knows what Morgan Freeman thinks he's up to, prowling around in the background as an out-of-place Moor, but he adds entertainment value too ‚Äì as does Christian Slater's weaselly Will Scarlett. There's action aplenty, along with a touch of viciousness and horror as the Sheriff of Nottingham consults a grisly old witch woman; not the usual kind of stuff you find in family fare. This movie is certainly no masterpiece, but there's something about it that's undeniably charming."
244,"Just to clarify, the cliffs where Robin and Azeem land on the beach are at Birling gap (near Seaford) and head toward Eastbourne in Sussex, England,(South Coast) they are known as the Seven Sisters cliffs and the seven peaks that make up the cliffs have names, they are also the same cliffs and view you can see on a Microsoft Windows 7 desktop backgrounds. To get up close you can park at the pub (The Golden Galleon) or by the seven sisters country park and take a half hour walk and be right underneath the cliffs as in the film, Been there many many times, its lovely there. Film is great, but certainly Robin would not 'be with my my father by nightfall' unless he and Azeem had some motorised assistance!"
245,"This movie was a 2nd Date movie for myself and my wife. At the time I really enjoyed it, and today it is still good to watch. Legend of Robin Hood was used to create this a great action, adventure movie with bits of romance and light comedy. Worth watching again and is safe for kids 10 and older.I do not want to give too much away but I will give some acclaims to things I liked about the movie. The story was great English soldier fighting in crusades makes it back to England and finds things have changed for the worse. So he sets to right the wrongs outside the law.Costner did a good job but was greatly aided by strong supporting cast. Morgan Freeman had a great character. Alan Rickman was soo good at being a bad guy it reminded me of his Die Hard performance. And even smaller parts were great by Christian Slater, M E Masterantonio, Michael Wincott and Michael McShane.Rent this and Dances With Wolves together for a 90's Costner-athon."
246,"One of those films that is used as a stick to beat Kevin Costner around the head with, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves was made for $48 million and went on to make a Worldwide profit of $343 million. That's the sort of stick beating I wouldn't mind taking occasionally! A very loose telling of the Robin Hood legend, Costner's movie is well known to have had production problems. Rushed and with more producers than number a five-a-side football team, the film went on to infuriate purists with its historical, geographical, linguistic and technical gaffes. And that's before we talk about the multitude of accents on offer. So to enjoy Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves you really have to be undemanding as regards any of the afore mentioned issues. To which the film then becomes an enjoyable old fashioned swashbuckling yarn driven by two great, yet differing, acting performances.Forget Costner, he's adequate in the role of the infamous green tighted one, this is Alan Rickman {Sheriff of Nottingham} and Morgan Freeman's {Azeem} movie. True, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Marian Dubois adds a touch of class, and Michael Wincott's turn as Guy of Gisborne is a nice line in villainy. But Freeman has the quality to give his character some worth, while Rickman runs away with the movie by playing Nottingham as a diabolical sulky git, it's very pantomime in execution, and Rickman is clearly having the time of his life with the role, but it's priceless entertainment. ""Call off Christmas"", one of the funniest moments of the 90s.It's one of those films where if someone said to me they thought it was the worst film of the modern era I could understand and sympathise. But then I'd point to the box office takings, Costner swinging thru windows and splitting arrows, and of course Rickman's delicious performance. Hey, sometimes you just got to ignore a lot to have a good old time regardless. 7/10"
247,"I loved this movie. I loved it when I was a kid and first saw it and still love it today. I watch this movie every once in a while just because it makes me feel great. Who cares that Kevin Costner doesn't have an English accent? I rather watch someone without then someone who tries to do so but fails at it. I think that the way Reynolds executed this movie is a great way of telling the tale. He really turns it into a fairy tale with a lot of over the top scenes but you've got to love those. The rest of the cast is magnificent but pleas people let's give KK a little more credit, I think he deserves it!"
248,"Robin of Locksley (Kevin Costner) has been a crusader these many years. Captured by the enemy, his life is in jeopardy but a strange twist of fate frees him and a companion, Azeem (Morgan Freeman), who is in debt to the young knight for his salvation from death. They journey back to England, where Robin flings himself into the cold water in his joy to be home. His delight is very short-lived. Robin soon finds his father hanging from the rafters at the family's castle, his death almost certainly at the hands of the cruel new leader, the sheriff of Nottingham (Alan Rickman). The true king, Richard the Lionhearted, has not returned from the crusades. Soon, also, Robin learns that a lady he once knew, Marian (Mary Elizabeth Mastriantonio) has grown quite beautiful but is the desired object of the sheriff as well. Since Robin and Azeem soon make themselves enemies of the sheriff, the two have no choice but to hide in the surrounding woods, where they collect other ""wanted men"", such as Will Scarlett (Christian Slater) and become a gang of outlaws, sworn to make trouble for the sheriff until he is eliminated. In a epic battle of might and will, who will be victorious? This is a modern classic of an old tale and it is certainly one of the best versions ever made, even including the very popular Errol Flynn version. Part of the credit should go to the tremendous cast, for Costner, Rickman, MEM, Slater, and others are excellent in their assigned roles. Freeman, especially, is a treat, as he puts a new twist into the picture, that of a dark-skinned man in Robin's band of merry men. One scene in particular, where Azeem jumps to the top of an arena and urges every brave man to fight for England, is especially memorable and effective. Then, too, one could hardly find a more beautiful production, for the scenery is lovely and the camera work of the absolute finest. Costumes, too, are most worthy and authentic. In summary, if you love any of the following, that is adventure, romance, the triumph of good, fine acting, or history, this is a film that will enchant you. This is one classic story that has a class written in every frame."
249,"I never thought I would say that a parody is more accurate to the spirit of the legend than the adaptation. ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" is fairly well-made, but is also morbid and morose. I am not expecting Prince John to suck his thumb at the mention of his mother, or men wearing tights to defeat an inept Sheriff of Rottingham. Still, the legend of Robin Hood originated in ballads and needs to be treated with more lightness and fun than we see here.Lead actor Kevin Costner is the movies biggest hindrance. His Robin Hood has no panache. Despite the amount of time skillfully invested in the character, Robin comes across as a boring, introverted man. He has one inspiring speech, but it seems out of character for the uncharismatic and brooding leader. I give Costner credit for doing a reasonable job within the demands of the story. The people who decided to send the character Robin Hood in the direction the movie takes him deserve the blame.I have not yet seen ""The Adventures of Robin Hood, the 1938 Errol Flynn movie. By all accounts, it is pleasurable and uplifting. In contrast, ""Prince of Thieves"" is a joyless, dreary affair. That tone is fine for other, more pensive stories set in the dark ages, but improper for the inspiring story of Robin Hood standing up for the defenseless. ""Dragonheart"" without the camp is closer to the proper tone.Speaking of ""Dragonheart,"" it contains torture and enough violence for a PG-13 rating; the torture seen during ""Prince of Thieves"" is far more graphic and distressing. The movie misses with its first arrow by opening with a hand being chopped off and a close friend of Hood's being fatally arrowed in the chest. It proceeds to portray far too much cruelty, graphic violence and gore. Too many people die and we see evil men burn villages while displaying no regard for human life. The audience can hear characters report these developments instead of seeing it in such detail. The raids can also be shown more generally and with less emphasis on the people being harmed. Homeowners insurance did not exist in the 12th Century.The writers omit Prince John as the villain and focus entirely on the Sheriff of Nottingham (Alan Rickman). Rickman had total control over his portrayal of the Sheriff. His performance implies that he was stuck between hamming it up for laughs and being evil beyond the boundaries of a Robin Hood story. There is too much diluted Hans Gruber in Rickman's overacting. Most of the jokes are about Nottingham being a sexaholic, and several of them come at the end as he is attempting something tremendously unfunny. His order to cancel Christmas amused me.Guy of Gisborne (Michael Wincott) is the far more effective villain. Wincott gives a cool, straightforward performance. Seeing him converse with Rickman reveals how effective the Sheriff of Nottingham could have been without the excesses of Rickman's acting. Wincott does not project an overly wicked personality; he shows an understated ruthlessness without needing to raise his voice. Sadly, Wincott is not granted the screen time he deserves.Morgan Freeman plays a moor named Azeem who owes Robin a life-debt. My respect for Freeman knows no bounds. His presence helps the movie's head stay above water. Azeem's jokes are funny mostly because of Freeman. Azeem is a more natural and rousing leader than Robin. He stands out amongst the other characters not because he is black, not because he creates a telescope and other such helpful inventions, but because Freeman does not subscribe to the grim nature of the film. Michael McShane is the movie's third diamond in the rough with his jolly spin on Friar Tuck. That mind-set evaporates when Tuck encounters a less honorable clergyman in the movie's best scene.The action is competently devised and choreographed, although some of the fights contain repetitive redundancies. A different method of shooting it would be welcome. Director Kevin Reynolds zooms the camera too far in and frequently shows one combatant from behind. Especially during Robin's first meeting with Little John (Nick Brimble), one fighter blocks most of the action. Although the cuts tend to be too close together, ""Prince of Thieves"" includes several good shots. The final assault on Nottingham stands above the rest in all categories.The filmmakers' uncalled-for treatment of the material is most unpleasant right before Robin swings through a window to save Marion. The movie is PG-13, but no 13 year-old should be seeing what occurs there. Considering the talent involved and the skill of the screenplay, ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" could have been special. Even with its problems, there is not a boring moment in the 143 of them. Even with a tighter focus on the people and the plot, no strength can overcome the disjointed format of the story. After all, the legend is titled Robin Hood and His Merry Men."
250,"'Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves' released in '91 is a terrific re-visioning of the Robin Hood mythos and by far my favorite Kevin Costner film. Costner delivers a strong and likable performance as Robin and Alan Rickman does what he does best in the role of his adversary, the villainous Sheriff of Nottingham. The film also contains a solid performance by Morgan Freeman as Moorish warrior and Robin's companion Azeem. His inclusion was a wonderful addition to the usual storyline. The films excellent production values; beautiful cinematography, wonderful period costumes, romantic and uplifting music, inventive storyline and superior cast make for an exciting adventure all around. One of the major complaints most reviewers have with this movie seem to center on Kevin Costner portrayal of Robin of Locksley. Maybe Costner doesn't quite possess the bravado and charming persona of the great Errol Flynn, but he makes a superior Robin Hood nonetheless."
251,"Maybe this is one of my guilty pleasures, or in other words a film that not too many people liked as much as i did. I grew up watching this and have seen it many times and still think its one of a kind as far as its story, performances and entertainment factor. This film just did it for me, and if it wasn't for some weird witchcraft scenes with the antagonist and his witch, i would have probably gave it a 10. Overall i liked this film a lot although some will call it clich√© and predictable at times, its still a favorite of mine, and perhaps its only because its a childhood favorite of mine. One of my favorite Costner performances IMDb Rating: 6.6, MY Rating: 9/10"
252,"The Errol Flynn version was a staple of my childhood, a movie I truly loved. Therefore, I was really looking forward to a big budget re-do of this subject. The result is compelling in just the way a car-crash might be: you know it's going to be bad (especially after reading all the comments here) but you can't help but look. My copy of this film is a wanton, guilty pleasure now and I pull it out once in a while to see what new detail gets me raving. Many of my favorites have been mentioned already (the gratuitously virtuous Azeem character, Costner's on again off again flirtation with an accent, over-wrought costuming). In short, this is a film by people who can't make up their minds. Is Marian a kick-ass babe or a damsel in distress rolling around on the floor? Is Costner going to try and behave like an English gentleman or be himself? Are we movie-goers smart enough to understand the Sheriff is *BAD* without a lot of heavy symbolism laid on top of him for good measure? Like some, my favorite moment is when Sean Connery appears. The sad thing about this is that this moment is very brief and comes at the very end of the movie. Until then, you can sit back and count the irritants, the biggest of which is that it could have been so much better."
253,"I think other users have successfully commented this movie well enough.But I must add a personal note: Sean Connery's cameo as King Richard LionHeart at the end is worth seeing the entire film. Great! Many people think it was a useless waste of money, but don't forget that King Richard is often quoted by the characters, he is the invisible engine that makes the whole story happen... If you think about it, he's the most important character after Robin Hood, he represents both law and goodness. So his final cameo is very important, mostly if portrayed by Sir Connery - THE King! P.S. who of us won't serve such a king? :-)"
254,"Robin Hood Prince of Thieves got terrible reviews when it came out although the public as usual ignored them and made it a big hit, helped no doubt by that horrid Bryan Adams song which somehow stayed in the UK charts for what seemed like years. But I digress..... Seen today, Robin Hood Prince Of Thieves is a bit of a mess, but fairly entertaining. It's not a patch on the wonderful Errol Flynn version-that version will probably never be surpassed, but this one might be more enjoyable for a modern audience.The main problem with the film is that it's elements constantly jar with one another and it never finds a consistent tone. We are presented with a very gritty, probably realistic view of the Middle Ages. Fair enough, the filmmakers had the guts to go completely against the prettiness of the 1939 classic. However, the violence is rather strong for a film aimed at a family audience, especially the opening scene set in a Moorish prison and a rape scene near the end- surely children should not see a woman's legs being forced apart by a man? The absurd attempts at political correctness {a Moor helping Robin Hood in England?},the use of lots of 'modern'terms,the rather large variety of accents and Alan Rickman's performance {and most of his scenes as the Sheriff Of Nottingham} undermine the attempts at seriousness. Rickman is great fun to watch, but he doesn't jell with the rest of the film.That's the chief problem, nothing seems to jell, partly because the filmmakers throw so much into the film. What is the point of subplots involving the sheriff and a witch, or Robin Hood finding out ? is his brother? The story of Robin Hood is a legend and adaptations do not always have to be too faithful to it, but there is so much in the original stories that could have been used in place of the filmmaker's silly inventions.Some elements do work well though. Kevin Costner is the dullest Robin Hood ever, but his scenes with Maid Marian in Robin's forest hide out have a dreamy romanticism. The sword fighting in the film is clumsy, but some action scenes, such as Robin's river encounter with Little John and an attack on the hideout are exciting. There are some good laughs, and a great surprise in the final scene. During some parts of the film, especially towards the end, {notably when Robin Hood and 'Azeem' are catapulted over a wall into the Sheriff's castle}, the film does have a real swashbuckling feel. Michael Kamen's score really aids this aspect of the film.One feels that a certain amount of re-editing would have helped a great deal. As it stands,there is without doubt some fun to be had here. The shame is it could have been a great deal more."
255,"This movie follows the classic story of Robin Hood, a stealer of rich people and giver to the poor people, taking on the Sheriff of Nottingham. Kevin Costner is a likeable Robin Hood, Morgan Freeman is great as his friend and side kick Azeem, Mary E. Mastranbino (if that's how you spell her last name) is good as Robin's love interest. Alan Rickman is predictably good in the film as well, as he usually is good in his films. The best part of the whole movie perhaps is the great mid evil combat and the fantastic sets. when I saw the movie years ago as a young boy, I wanted to make a village in my local wood lot and I wanted a bow and arrow. okay I was a bit messed up back then but the sets are that memorable and likeable.performances good, set pieces excellent, and it has the ability to keep the viewer's interest. the only complaints is that it's a bit long and that old witch you see occasionally is quite annoying. her last appearance in the film is not pleasant either. But still, overall the movie was well done. ***/****"
256,"I have always wanted to see the film Alan Rickman was acting in, because it seemed to be totally different (and much more entertaining) than the drivel Costner was in.  This is possibly the worst Robin Hood film I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot of them."
257,"I'm astonised to see some of the comments regarding this film. Do people not realise that its not supposed to be a serious piece of cinema. Its a mindless adventure/Comedy with huge holes in the plot that nobody bothered to sort out because they really don't matter in this type of film. Kevin Costner is fine as the lead (The fact he kept the American accent should have made people realise the lighthearted nature of the film)and Alan Rickman is excellant as the villian. For a evening of TV that you dont have to think too hard about, this is just about the perfect film."
258,"I just completed watching the Extended version of **Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, which runs 155 minutes and includes new extended scenes not seen in the theatrical release, and I think the movie was fantastic, even the theatrical release version which runs 144 minutes is a masterpiece, all of you who wrote reviews negating this movie expecially the long winded ones you should seek therapy as we all have better things to do than sit in front of a computer and trash other peoples work, when we have starred in a major motion picture or have stepped in the directors box, then we can criticize, movie: 10/10, other negative reviews; Sourgrapes, get a life!!"
259,"In my opinion, this is the best version of Robin Hood.  Kevin Costner brings a great sense of irreversable heroiny to the screen.  Alan Rickman as the Sherrif of Nottingham was a great choice also.  Morgan Freeman was a very interesting character and you couldn't help but like M. E. M. as the Lady Marion. 7.5 out of 10."
260,"***Starring: Kevin Costner, Morgan Freeman, Alan Rickman, and Christian Slater.Well...uh....the plot is....the story of Robin Hood.  Well for those who don't happen to know the story of Robin Hood, it's about a prisoner who tries to avenge the death of his father by grouping people and fighting back against the Sheriff of Nottingham.  After explaining that plot, it reminded me of a similarity of this story and Spartacus.  Spartacus is a slave (Robin a prisoner) and goes into hiding and forms an army to fight back. Weird.The movie is surprisingly fun and a well represented adaptation of the famous story.  It has fun good guys, and fun bad guys.I recommend it."
261,"I believe this to be the best version of Robin Hood made. Kevin Costner's character was a bit pointless in certain places, but he had a brilliant supporting cast. Christian Slater was (in my opinion) not only the best actor in the film, his character was, (while smaller than others) the most interesting and thought out. Alan Rickman's character was thoughtfully acted out, and the most enjoyable to watch. Morgan Freeman looked a bit out of place in the film, and his role would have been more interesting if it was bigger. Alot of the time he just got in the way. Sean Connery as Richard I ruined the end of the film. Another- not so well known actor should have taked his place. Although I dont agree that he should have played Richard I, I do think he acted well in a corny ending to a brilliant film."
262,"If you're looking for award winning acting from Kevin Costner then you are probably not going to care much for this film.  If you want a decent action/adventure movie then I would highly recommend this movie.I too, as I read in another review of this movie, watched this movie on a daily basis when I was 12 years old.  Ten years later I bought the DVD and I am still quite entertained by this story.Costner isn't as bad as the other reviews would have you believe while Morgan Freeman, Alan Rickman, and Mary E. Manstrantonio deliver great performances.  check it out!"
263,"(Spoilers Possible)This was the first big blockbuster I can remember, and I'd spent years disliking it, but I couldn't figure out what the problem was, and then it hit me.  The whole character of Will Scarlet.I'd been brought up on Robin Hood since I was young and to have Will Scarlet defamed like that.  He would never do anything like that to Robin Hood.  And yes I know it's only a fictional character but the way the film portrays him is wrong.Other problems:1) Azeem - Yes, Robin Hood had a sidekick who stayed with him no matter what.  His name was Little John (There's another character who's name was besmirched).  But Morgan Freeman does brilliantly as Azeem, and makes the film bareable.2) Robin Hood never went to the Holy Lands, he stayed at home to defend England from Prince John.3) Will Scarlet - just horrible how they treat him, and the rest of the Merry Men.4) Robin Hood, who is as dull as dishwater.  This is the only time I have ever wanted the evil Sheriff of Nottingham to win.There were a couple of good points,1) The Sheriff of Nottingham, who makes the film bareable and watchable. And grabs most of the best lines.2) The theme song.  I love it.But that's it.  I'd still say watch it 'cause it's a good way to waste a couple of hours, but as a Robin Hood film it's very poor."
264,Another silly vanity picture for Kevin Costner.  He should learn the joy of ensemble acting.  The picture jumps like a mad schizophrenic from campy humor (The philandering sheriff) to so-so action scenes spiced up with gimmick photography. (Camera chasing the arrow.)  It's only saving grace is the good performances from his supporting cast.  Morgan Freeman as the moor and Alan Rickman as the delightfully evil sheriff come to mind. If you want a much better swashbuckler try the old Adventures of Robin Hood from the thirties or the Three Musketeers with Gene Kelly and Orson Welles.
265,"Costner, at his best.  Cheesy yet adorable stuff and supported fabulously by Alan Rickman, who is, lets face it, some kind of legend.  Rickman's portrayal of the Sheriff is possibly the most entertaining villain I have ever seen.  He's fantastic.  Christian Slater does his job too as Will Scarlet and Morgan Freeman as Azeem?  What more can you ask for!  It's historically inaccurate for so many reasons but it's just so much fun! Watch and enjoy!"
266,"Contrary to the bad and mediocre reviews you may read here, there ARE people who liked this film, and I'm one of them.  It's true that Morgan Freeman outshines Kevin, true that Alan Rickman is so well loved that it's hard to celebrate his death, even true that Kevin's acting is just mediocre, and that he did not attempt an English accent for the film, However...  It does have some very good aspects as well:
ONE: I would much rather have Kevin speaking American dialect, than do a BAD English accent.  Nothing sounds worse than an American dumbing down the English dialect with a poor impression of it.TWO: The movie did look real, with real drama and action and great, decorative costumes.  The metal rivets and details, capes and gloves and weapons were all spectacular.   Even the backgrounds, props and horse tack looked great and genuine in a way that no Robin Hood movie has achieved before. I will take men in black and brown leather over green tights any day. THREE: Unlike other Robin Hood movies, this one has a supporting cast of great characters that are believable and really part of the story. Maid Marian, Will Scarlett, The Sheriff and Little John are not just ciphers here, but actual people with motivations and humanity.  Add to the cast some GEMS like Azeem, Duncan and Guy of Gisborne, and you have a real band of merry and not-so-merry men who give realism to a movie that would otherwise be recycled fare.  
**** It's a tried, serviceable plot enhanced by rich characters and lifelike imagery, out of the storybook legend and into the real Sherwood Forest.  I would like to have seen the archery contest for the golden arrow but, honestly, I will take Prince of Thieves over any other Robin Hood movie. The humanity and real-life approach to it sets it well above any other attempt at this well-trod fable.  And even if you don't like the technical aspects of it, there's still plenty to look at.  Lovely and talented Mary Mastrontonio as Marian, irresistible Alan Rickman as the villain, and brusque, gravel-voiced Wincott as Guy of Gisborne.  Freeman's minimal role in this is still a treat, and Kevin is eye candy at the very least.  There's lots of capes rustling, metal clanking and leather creaking and swishing as everyone walks around.  Plenty of arrow slinging and sword fighting, and even sorcery, blood and explosions.  It's a masculine, hero story with its own, special perspective ...What's not to love?"
267,This film is full of action and keeps the viewer on the edge of their seats. Robin Hood Prince Of Theives wiil evolke emotions of anger lament and fear in the viewer. The characters are well cast particularly (in my oppinion) Christian Slater as Will Scarlet. Generally a good film to be viewed by almost anyone.
268,"The historic setting of this movie is completely wrong (I should know, I study history), Costner isn't the best actor you will ever see, but I still love this movie. If only for Alan Rickman who seems to know perfectly well what kind of nonsense he is selling. He is brilliant in his funny sarcasm. I'm a fan of all Robin Hood movies (The Disney-version rules too,(hey, I didn't forget my childhood dreams)), so I'm probably not the best critic for this job, but I really like the camera-work and the speed of the movie. Over-dramatic? Sure, but not the annoying kind. You should laugh about the anachronisms, not let them annoy you. After all, it says nowhere that this movie is based on true historic facts.  (9 out of 10)"
269,"The 1991 version of the classic adventure owes more to the Lucas/Spielberg school of mythmaking than to anything resembling English legend, revising the familiar story to include, for purely demographic reasons: a token Moor as Robin's sidekick; a sibling rivalry between Robin and Will Scarlet; a liberated Marion, no longer identified as a maiden; and (shades of Luke Skywalker) a motivation of revenge against the killer of Robin's father. (The treacherous Prince John is dispensed with altogether, leaving the Sheriff of Nottingham, by himself an unlikely threat to the English Crown.) Worse yet, the revision is totally unfaithful to the spirit of the original fable, with none of Robin Hood's trademark swashbuckling charm. The result is a noisy, cruel, excessively violent adventure, filmed through a hyperactive fish-eye lens to hold the attention of jaded TV children more apt to be frightened than amused. Of course the only reason to have made the film at all was as a vehicle for Kevin Costner, whose laid-back American manners are completely wrong for the dashing outlaw, and whose Republican Party sympathies make him an odd choice for a thief devoted to stealing from the rich."
270,"This movie was not a tasteful portrayal of the legend of Robin Hood. As a little girl, I went to Nottingham, visited Sherwood Forest and fell in love with the legend of Robin Hood while standing in the Major Oak. Robin Hood (Kevin Costner) and Wil Scarlett (Christian Slater) whether intentional or not do not even have English accents but everyone else does. The best actors in the movie were Little John (Nick Brimble), King Richard (Sean Connery), and for a wonderful taste of comedy there is Much the Miller's son (Jack Wild) in a brief scene. I wish the movie had more brilliant shining moments like that one because this movie was too dark and too violent. It needed more light and fun scenes between the merry men. It focused too much on Robin and Marion and not enough on the the bond between the Merry Men."
271,"I have to say I was quite skeptical about the casting of all American Kevin Costner as the legendary medieval British outlaw Robin Hood. But you watch the film a few times and Costner kind of grows on you. He's not quite in the same mold as Douglas Fairbanks, Cornel Wilde, Richard Greene and of course Errol Flynn.Still this film has a lot to offer for the lavish amount of money spent on it. We get a multi-cultural Robin Hood and a character who was doing a lot of running around with Robin and the Merry Men like Little John, Friar Tuck, Will Scarlett and the rest that being Morgan Freeman playing Azeem. It seems as though Robin Of Locksley was captured by the Moors on the way back from the Crusades and helping him make an escape is Freeman who has his own reasons for wanting to flee his own people. After a while Freeman seems to fit in with the gang from Sherwood Forest.What's really fascinating here is the elevation of the Sheriff of Nottingham who is lifted a few notches from ordinary villainy. Alan Rickman is a poor relation to the royal family and he's playing for far bigger stakes than bribes that come with his occupation. He's got most evil designs on Maid Marian and it is emphasized that as a medieval maid should be she's chaste. Rickman's going to put an end to that and he plans to marry her and claim a piece of that throne one way or another while King Richard is held for ransom by his foreign enemies. Rickman also dabbles in the black arts assisted by a witch played by Geraldine McEwan, most sinister and most effective. Rickman is the guy to watch here even if he does go a bit over the top at times.Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves got only one Oscar nomination for the song Everything I Do I Do It For You, one of the best ballads of the 90s. Bryan Adams who introduced and had a hand in writing it plays a character simply entitled balladeer. Why that is so I don't know because the Merry Men did have their own balladeer Alan-A-Dale. He should have been given that character name. Costner ain't Errol Flynn, but no doubt he's the modern Robin Hood."
272,"Continuing my plan to watch every Kevin Costner movie in order, I come to Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves from 1991.Plot In A Paragraph: When Robin of Locksley (KC) and his companion (Morgan Freeman) come to England and are confronted with the tyranny of the Sheriff of Nottingham (Alan Rickman) he decides to fight back.1991 was a big year for KC, I remember prior to this movie and JFK being released, I read an article called 'How Do You Follow Up A Movie Like Dances With Wolves?' and it was a great read about the pressure of following up a movie that won 7 Oscars. I think he delivered in spades in 1991, and continues his great run. I don't care what people say about his accent, KC is my Robin Hood, and both of my kids Robin Hood, for a long time, my eldest always referred to KC as Robin Hood, no matter what movie he was watching him in. He plays it a bit more serious than Errol Flynn, but he is much more fun, than the Russell Crowe version.Just like in Die Hard, Alan Rickman steals the show as the Sheriff of Nottingham, he is fun, over the top and with his sneering delivery of his one liners, he is in full pantomime villain mode, and his is the definitive rendition of Nottingham's Sheriff. I adore Rickman, and think he is an under rated actor, who only seemed to be appreciated after he left us too soon Christian Slater is fine as the jealous Will Scarlett and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is OK as Maid Marian, but she changes from a strong, independent woman when we first meet her, into a clich√©d damsel in distress by the end of the movie.In the late eighties (starting with 'Street Smart' opposite Christopher Reeve) and particularly the early to mid nineties. Morgan Freeman could do no wrong in my book. A wonderful actor who brought a touch of class to every movie he made. Then something happened, every movie maker and studio caught on to the fact, and he suddenly became the 'go to' guy. Then suddenly he was everywhere releasing several movies a year, all of varying quality. Often he was in supporting roles. Some were brilliant, some were still enjoyable (Million Dollar Baby, Bruce Almighty and Now You See Me) some were not (Take your pick!!) and you often think ""I hope he was well paid"" as he clearly took this for the money. This is thankfully one of the former. Freeman plays a Azeem, a man committed to prayer, whose loyalty surpasses all others and whose level-headed guidance proves he's much more than a sidekick. He is an equal. Sean Connery pops up too as a favour to KC, and donated his salary to charity too. Michael Kamens score seems to be forgotten about, due to the success of Brian Adams song, Everything I Do (I Do It For You) which dominated charts everywhere. 14 weeks at the top of the Billboard Chart, and a record breaking 16 weeks at the top of the UK charts. Don't get me wrong, it's far from perfect, the pacing is a bit off at times, with some unnecessary subplots dragging it down a bit. But there are so many memorable moments, it doesn't matter. I don't think I will ever not enjoy watching this movie. Prince Of Thieves ended the year with a domestic gross of $165 million, ending the year, the 2nd highest grossing movie of 1991. 8/10 for this Reviewer. I almost went with a 9/10 such is my enjoyment of the movie."
273,"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is an adventure film that is directed by Kevin Reynolds. Kevin Costner heads the cast list as Robin Hood. together with Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Maid Marian of Dubois, Morgan Freeman as Azeem, Christian Slater as Will Scarlet, and Alan Rickman as the Sheriff of Nottingham.This 90's version of Robin Hood was directed by Kevin Reynolds.The spirit of adventure is alive and well in this retooling of the exploits of a legendary hero.Costner's lousy English accent is a small obstacle in this often exciting version of the Robin Hood fable. That aside, it's refreshing to have a preface to the old story in which we meet the robber hero of Sherwood Forest as a soldier in King Richard's Crusades, coming home to find his people under siege from the cruelties of the Sheriff of Nottingham. After Robin and his community of outcasts and fighters take to the trees, director Kevin Reynolds is on more familiar narrative ground, and he goes for the gusto with lots of original action. Mastrantonio, as Marion, makes a convincing damsel in distress, and Freeman brings dignity to his role as Robin's Moor friend. Rickman, however, gets the most attention for his scene-chewing role as the rotten sheriff, an almost campy performance that is highly entertaining but perhaps a little out of sorts with the rest of the film."
274,"The best you can say about K Costner's RHPoT is that it's not as bad as many other Robin Hood films that have littered the history of cinema. The folk-story itself has become pantomime (literally) and the worst you can do is to try to play it straight, which thankfully doesn't happen here due to the presence of the likes of Alan Rickman and Geraldine McEwan. Unfortunately there are enough attempts at gravitas to make it an excruciating watch for an adult. The standard R. Hood clich√©s abound as do the anachronisms - which I suppose won't bother kids.The really odd thing though is that the film even looks ten years older than it's 1991 date would indicate - I'm sure blow-dried mullet haircuts were old hat (or old-hair even) by 1991. Any money spent on it doesn't really seem reflected on screen - the sets look very much like sets. I also noticed a few scenes taken straight out of the great Errol Flynn film of 1938 - homage or desperate plagiarism? Producers should stick well clear of Robin Hood - but they come back to it time after time like wasps to a can of fizzy drink, and the results whether on film or TV are invariably dire. The exception of course is Errol Fynn's classic 1938 romp, but no-one will ever come close to that. Mind you comparing a film which has an ""original song"" by Bryan Adams to one with a soundtrack by Erich Korngold is a bit unfair."
275,"Another decade, another version of Robin Hood, with another Hollywood cast of superstars.Plot: Erm, well, essentially this is the well-known tale featuring a kind hearted fella who steals from the rich and giveth to the stinking, grubby proletariat. A few interesting twists and turns, including the hilarious addition of a Moor and a comedy Sheriff. Ho ho. A bit of action for the lads (swords AND explosions, cool!!!), a bit of Kev's bum for the ladies (and some romance, aah, vom), a couple of child actors, the odd joke and occasional bit of seriousness and we have the complete Hollywood film experience.Cast and acting: Kev is a pretty good actor and after the first 20 minutes I became oblivious to the inappropriateness of his trans-Atlantic accent. He gets one or two cheeky lines out and a bit of a snog and generally does well, although does come across as quite irritating at times. Morgan Freeman is a very talented actor and I thought that he did well, mixing seriousness with humour. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is eye-catching and reasonably cast as Maid Marion. But... the star of the show is demonstrably Alan Rickman, who manages to ham it up throughout this film and, in my opinion, gets all of the best lines. Sean Connery's cameo was rubbish. Brian Blessed's brief scene was a joy to behold. Christian Slater is a very capable performer but was horribly mis-cast in this picture. The other actors did well, although there were no outstanding performances that spring immediately to mind.Rubbish bits: Robin marrying Marion, with Sean Connery. I mean, come on.Good bits: Dunno where the film was shot, and I don't care enough to look it up on Google (other search engines are available), but the scenery is all spectacular. The serious tone at the beginning of the film is particularly enjoyable, preceding as it does the inescapable, inevitable descent into romantic mush.Other stuff: Make sure that you watch the full-length film, as up until recently I have only ever seen the edited-for-TV version, which has clearly been sensitively prepared by a myopic, chainsaw-wielding ape.Quotes: ""Hello my lover""; ""You, my room, 10:30 tonight. You, 10:45, and bring a friend."""
276,"Kevin Costner had worked hard the year before to cement his place in Hollywood as a serious director and actor, and nearly undid all of it with his embarrassing performance in this film.Though at the time I believe this film was a hit, so maybe the joke's on me. Costner can't hold on to his British accent for anything, and actually just gives up on it about 20 minutes into the movie, spending the rest of it talking like an American. Alan Rickman enlivens things through his performance as the villain and has the film's funniest scene, but the fact that that scene involves his attempts to rape Maid Marion should tell you something about the approach of director Kevin Reynolds.The whole thing is far more violent than it needs to be and way too long. ""Robin Hood"" should be a sprightly story, not this lead-footed thing.Grade: C"
277,"There are so many versions of the legendary outlaw who robs from the rich and gives to the poor. This one, goes as far from the Errol Flynn version. In ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"", Robin of Locksley(Kevin Costner) gets all outlaws together including a Moor named Azeem(Morgan Freeman) to overthrow a tyrannical lawman: The Sheriff of Nottingham(Alan Rickman). Sheriffs are supposed to enforce the lawman, this one heavily taxing citizens, having a witch with him, that's abusing of authority. When Robin was imprisoned, he met Azeem who is a Moor(A Muslim) but he is highly tolerant. He puts his trust into Robin, and he does the same for him. Most of the outlaws would have a Moor to join the band, but they have no choice. The scenes are great. I liked the part when a young girl asks Azeem why is he ""painted"". And don't forget the fiery bow and arrows. A classic! Most of the other scenes are typical, yet they are a bit graphic compared to the classics. Bryan Adams hit song, ""Everything I do, I do it for you"" provides the perfect touch to this hit movie. This movie is about honor, trust, love and respect. Highly enjoyable! 5 stars!"
278,"Kevin Costner has made some of the worst films( The Postman, Waterworld) in the history of moviedom but he tops them all in this totally unnecessary farce. How do you screw up the story of Robin Hood? Let me count the ways. Try to be politically correct by having a Moor in the story. Try to put modern day sensibilities in the script, and mostly cast the woodenest actor on the planet in the lead role. Ye gods. There have been many great swashbucklers in film, Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and Jr., Tyrone Power, and the greatest of them all, Errol Flynn. They are turning over in their graves. Costner couldn't swash a buckle if it bit him on the bottom. Charley McCarthy could have done a better job with a good deal more animation."
279,"This is my most favorite movie of all time!! It's so amazing! Kevin Costner was an excellent choice for the part of Robin.The movie was so intense and it kept me guessing on what was going to happen next. Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves made me laugh and cry. I loved it so much! The soundtrack is also incredible. The song, Everything I Do I Do For You, by Bryan Adams, is also my favorite song. It's so beautiful and incredible.My favorite part was when it showed the silhouette of Robin in the smoke after everyone thought he was dead. The music for that part was fantastic to. It was so emotional."
280,"Ah Robin Hood, of Locksley (Kevin Costner). How I warmed up to one inventive battle scene after another. Robin floats onto a bareback horse and slides, just as easily off of it, making it look so simple to the eyes of inexperience. It was the most playful infused sword, bow and arrow, swash buckling film, I have seen, in some time. Never have I so freely giggled among violence, gore, conniving, stabbings, evil-doers and really neat homemade and makeshift war defense mechanisms. Why you ask? It must have been a free and easy going, almost coasting, but not quite, and truly authentic Robin (of Locksley) Hood. It was the man who inspired English dwelling ""outcasts,"" to make a better life for themselves, even amid turmoil and corruption, in the beautiful and scenic Nottingham, England.The film opens with a concise paragraph on relevant history of the time and setting. King Richard, ""The Lion Heart,"" of England, (unidentified actor) 800 years ago, is fighting to reclaim the Holy Land, Jerusalem, Israel, from the Turks. But from the film's start, mutiny unfolds, when the Nottingham Sheriff (Alan Rickman) and his group conspire and hang Richard. In 1193 or 1194, Richard's son, Robin is barely alive, as he and his cell mate Azeem (Morgan Freeman), a native South African and follower of Islam, together, plan their escape from the dark dungeon, in Jerusalem. Azeem feeling indebted to Robin, for helping save his life, now follows Robin, whom he calls Christian, offering, not only guidance, encouragement and wisdom's truth, but a huge helping hand in defending off bad guys, with his machete knife. Freeman offers a soft center, comfort, support, spirituality, and home, not of permanence, but of every evolving comprehension. You cannot help but to identify with his essence, both on stage and off of it.Robin's purpose becomes threefold: 1) avenge his father's untimely death, and as usual, defend and save the family name, which means defeating the evil Sheriff of Nottingham 2) motivate forest dwellers to defend their life, among natural riches and resources of the forest, and finally, 3) enjoy some adventure while aiding the forest community to claim victory over a disorganized and corrupt government, lead by interim leader, the Sheriff.Robin succeeds on all three levels, instilling confidence, courage, will power and dignity to him and all those whom he teaches not only to defend their livelihood, but to comfortably and satisfyingly live, within the community they cultivate. Somehow, when there is a common objective, that being to fight off the bad guy, everyone pulls together that much quicker and friendlier, pushing prior pettiness aside. But not all feel perfectly content with Robin's influence, and that is why there is the character, Will Scarlett (Christian Slater). He is not one to easily adapt to the new productive forest companions that had not existed as such, prior to Robin's subtle and persuasive entrance.By the middle of the film, Robin is clearly living within the world he sees magically taking shape, by his voluntary direction and people's free will. As in every ""classic hero"" movie, the credibility and portrayal of the of the anti-hero, or evil bad guy is critically instrumental to both the hero's and the film's success. Fortunately, Alan Rickman is incredibly fabulous and pulls forth all his weight, in embodying the sinister Sheriff. Believe it or not, he has a glimmer of sex appeal, with his jet-black head and facial hair, and strong presence; but we acknowledge him more, as we are supposed to, with the credibility of his pervasive evilness. Kevin Reynolds, the film's Director, clearly knows how to completely bring to life, the evil guy. In the Sheriff, that slight sexiness and sad vulnerability draws us in more readily and actively to the dark side of the anti-hero, in a more personal way. The Sheriff's wicked and witch looking cohort admits to being his mother. Surrounded by her witchcraft, in a dark room, far from a more civilized nature, she adds her punch to the evil bunch. Clearly, Kevin Reynolds not only knows what he wants from the actors, as far as portrayal, but it appears that he makes sure that every single one successfully acts with the intended purpose, to credibly entertain the audience, by offering us more laughs than we first thought imaginable. It did feel like Kevin, as Robin, did not really offer himself over to the character, for the first 30 minutes or so, to the film, or he may have been attempting, but seemed to need a firmer direction. Nevertheless, we dismiss his weak introductory delivery, for the character he becomes, as the film develops more completely. It seemed as if the extras, ironically, were having so much fun in the battle scenes, that it might have become contagious and shone forth in great acting, among all involved, but particularly for Kevin, whose screen play became almost addictive for the watching audience. In one of the concluding battle scenes, I could not help but notice his eyes yielding to subtle magic, of all before him. On his platform of battle stance, his eyes unconsciously wove a passive and active fabric, and I saw the truth of playful boy, whose eyes smiled upon his conscientious cast mates in battle, all of whom he now connected by more than duty, but by shared spirit. Now his vision was clearly that of Robin Hood, and we could all be so proud and romanticized, at the same time.(see Robin Hood, part II for remaining Movie Talk)"
281,"Actually I like Robin Hood movies, but this one was a big disappointment because of two things:1. The story is pure clich√©. I didn't expect it to be very sophisticated - we're talking about Robin Hood, aren't we? - but this is so without any charme and finesse, it almost bored me to tears.2. Kevin Costner. I don't know much of him in other movies and after this one I don't think I want to watch much more of him. In ""Robin Hood"" I saw a few trees who did better acting as Mr Costner - and why didn't the director ask him to take out this chewing gum he was mumbling on all the time?
The only thing worth watching in this movie was Alan Rickman - and even his performance didn't convince me entirely because his character, the Sheriff of Nottingham, is written so poorly Rickman didn't get much of a chance to do more out of him as some silly comic."
282,"His unforgettable and funny quote when he really gets p***ed off, Rickman twists and yells: ""I'll cut your heart out!! With a SPOON!!!""Alan Rickman playing the Sheriff of Nottingham is simply great stuff, without him this film probably would have been even worse then it already is. Actors like Kevin Costner, Morgan Freeman and Christian Slater tries hard making this an epic and romantic adventure but they miss a bit too much. 'Cause the movie has something nice in it, you can clearly see that but they don't really reach that point.As said, Rickman steals the show with a time of crime doing anything from ordering women into his room, trying to have sex with Marion, chopping his sword after Robin and talking creepy with that old, ugly witch. Costner take his bolt and bow and runs threw the Sherwood forest with a lot of confidence and, okay - Costner does a nice job. Freeman again is not that entertaining and cool, same to Slater playing the angry youngster.It's a lot of nice nature and landscape, some of the Robin Hood style is there and it's pretty entertaining. STARS: *** 3/5 (being very nice)"
283,"Okay so Costner couldn't manage an English accent and is not the best actor to grace the green tights but that is not the attraction of this film. The plethora of unforgettable quotes, provided in no small part by Alan Rickman and Morgan Freeman, mixed with the well managed action scenes certainly make this an entertaining experience."
284,"I'll have to say this:The relaxed style of Kevin Costner simply suits Robin Hood. I've always enjoyed Kevin Costner's relaxed acting, and somehow he's the perfect Robin Hood! The film itself isn't a masterpiece but the casting is perfect! Both Kevin C. and the rest of the actors work brilliantly in their roles! I just had to say this!"
285,"One part action drama, one part romance, a part pseudo-realistic update, two of pantomime and half a part political correctitude: this film is an unconvincing mess carried out with a complete lack of the subtlety and cleverness that would be required to pull off such a demanding mix.The casting of Costner as Robin just defies belief, completely wrong for the part in every way (including but not only the much-commented hopelessly jarring accent).The writing was unclever, much of it sickly and obvious as only Hollywood can do. Despite using some beautiful countryside and the extraordinary town of Carcassone as backdrops, many of the scenes look like something out of badly funded amateur dramatics (the Turkish city scenes with sand thrown over paved road so obviously, the ludicrous housing in Sherwood Forest and accompanying tools and weapons they made out of nothing (what about the bows made out of the thinnest roundest greenest little branches you could find, about as much chance of launching a true-flying arrow as would a cup of mashed potato).Lady Marion morphs from a resolute and capable well-trained fighter in efficient charge of her country fiefdom into a simpering ing√©nue in the space of twenty minutes. I mean, if you want to create a fun effect by this sort of transition for some useful dramatic purpose, fine, but in this film it is completely purposeless and just adds to the irritation and general disjointedness.I have no idea why I purchased this DVD apart from the fact I had high hopes and it was in the bargain basket - obviously I should have 'read the signs' better. If you're after a clever, insightful retelling of an old story this is not it -- you'd be better off staring at a blank wall for two hours."
286,This is such a great movie. I thought it was really great. This is the best of all the hundreds of films about the same character (Robin Hood) but this one is better than that because it has a new spin that will make you like it even more.The story is about a prince who returns home to find his kingdom stolen by the evil sheriff of Nottinghams and BOY IS HE NOT HAPPY! He starts on a rampage to reclaim his throne and win his girl back (who has been put in a prison by an old witch with one blue eye and one eye not there). He is helped along the way by a young priest and a man who is an Arab (which is where the film begins).As soon as it was over and the credits had finished moving up the screen all the way to the top I rewound the tape and watched it again about a week later and enjoyed it even more. That was when I was a younger man but it's even better now.It's like drinking a milkshake of your favourite flavour (whatever your favourite flavour for those milkshakes is) and it cannot be beaten as a film. You will like it.
287,"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves i think is a fantastic movie. Really i think this should have been in the top 250 movies the best ones of all time. Well maybe one day they this will be in the top 250 best movies. The song ""Everything i do (I do it for you) sung by Bryan Adams was made in 1991 and was #1 in the uk for 16 weeks. That is the longest running amount of weeks Uk have had in history."
288,"* out of ****Kevin Costner's made a lot of bad movies in his time, but I've always had a tendency to find at least something to enjoy about them.  After all, I thought Waterworld was a blast and The Postman wasn't half-bad for a cornball epic.  But Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (which is actually another teaming between Costner and Kevin Reynolds, the man who directed Waterworld) is just terrible, a messy period piece adventure that astounds me with its awful acting, amateurish writing, and lackluster battle scenes.Costner stars as the titular Prince of Thieves, a warrior who's returned from the Crusades to his home in England with a Muslim friend (Morgan Freeman), only to find his father has been murdered by the Sheriff of Nottingham and his property burnt to a crisp.  Taking to the woods with the Sheriff's men close behind, Robin forges a bond with the people living in the Sherwood Forest.  Thus, he decides to lead the people, to steal from the rich and give to the poor.  Along the way, he finds love with Lady Marian (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), the King's cousin, whom has also caught the eye of the Sheriff (Alan Rickman), who plots to usurp the throne while the King is still off fighting in the Crusades.This 90's rendition of Robin Hood is meant to play as pure summer-style escapist entertainment, something I can accept, but it fails on those levels, and it's on that level I criticize it.  The script is packed with horrible dialogue and logic leapholes.  Let me take into consideration Robin Hood's plan.   He steals from the rich, then distributes the money to the poor.  Obviously, they'll use the money to feed themselves, but I doubt they could spend such money without bringing suspicion onto themselves.I love watching sword-clashing period piece adventures, but Prince of Thieves appears to have been specifically designed to alienate everything it is  I enjoy about such pictures.  The battle scenes are mostly bloodless and poorly choreographed, the characters act in anachronistic manners, the costumes look like nothing more than mere rags stolen from a local high school production, the only bit of nudity comes from a male character, and there's even a pop tune in the end credits!Most astonishing of all is that this movie elicits the worst performances from almost every actor involved that I'm familiar with.  I've said before Kevin Costner is underrated, but he's hardly immune to poor performances. As Robin Hood, this is by far his worst turn ever, constantly switching back and forth between an English and American accent, the former of which is almost undetectable except for a scene where he dresses up as a commoner. Morgan Freeman is a wonderful actor, but he's out of his league here as Robin's faithful ""servant,"" Azeem.  Silly accent aside, he's even the victim of p***-poor editing; near the end, he encounters the Sheriff's witch and speaks to her as if though he recognizes her even though they'd never met before (post-editing lapse, perhaps?).  As expected, Christian Slater, one of the banes of good acting, is at his worst as the untrustworthy Will Scarlet.There is only one merit I can credit this picture with.  What is the movie's sole positive aspect?  Easily, it's Alan Rickman as the Sheriff of Nottingham.  The man's turned in a lot of great villainous performances in his time, but this possibly his best, mixing wry sarcasm with generally as much over-the-top evil hysterics as possible.  If ever a time you actually felt like rooting for the bad guy, this would be it, simply because Rickman displays more acting chops and energy on-screen than Costner.A longer director's cut has just been released that apparently clears up a few plot holes, but I don't really think I could bear to watch more of this film, since most of its flaws are related to its dialogue, performances, and direction, aspects an extra few minutes could only make worse."
289,"ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES (1991) **1/2 Kevin Costner, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Morgan Freeman, Alan Rickman, Christian Slater. Lackluster update of the classic tale of Robin of Loxley who formed a band of vigilantes to aid the suffering hamlet of Sherwood Forest from the vile monarchy of King John and the Sheriff of Nottingham (Rickman, who steals the show). Sean Connery has a cameo."
290,"I remember quite a bit about the Walt Disney cartoon, and when I heard about this live action version about the beginning of Robin Hood, I wanted to see it quite desperately. Basically Robin of Locksley (Kevin Costner) started out as some kind of hopeful guy who wanted to help his local town of Nottingham with his friend Azeem (Morgan Freeman). He later sets up the Merry Men team, including Christian Slater as Will Scarlett, Michael McShane as Friar Tuck and Nick Brimble as Little John. But he also meets his beautiful love interest, Marian Dubois (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio). The only person trying to stop Robin from stealing from the rich and giving to the poor is the really, really mean Sheriff of Nottingham (Alan Rickman). Also starring Brian Blessed as Lord Locksley and a very brief Sir Sean Connery as King Richard. What most people remember about this film more though is the 16 week number one single, Bryan Adams' ""(Everything I Do) I Do It for You"", which was number 30 on The 100 Greatest Number One Singles, but also number 14 on The 100 Worst Pop Records, why? Very good!"
291,"If you like the story of Robin Hood, skip this disappointment. This was 1 of 2 versions scheduled for release in 1991, and because this one had Kevin Costner, the other decided to be shown on TV. Shame, since I would of went to see the other a dozen times in the theater and asked for my money back for this one.Costner is wooden to be kind (and my apologies to wood for this insult).I found it boring, dull, and not at all interesting to watch, and I blame Costner. He is a HORRIBLE Robin Hood.Watch the Classic. Watch the Disney. Watch the Fox 1991 version (one of the best ever, IMHO), but pass over this, unless you are a Costner fan (and why people are, I have no idea - he seems to be able to play one character, himself, and if it doesn't fit the character he's playing, it becomes wooden and predictable... though if the character is a lot like him, he appears brilliant)."
292,"Havng just caught it again on television... I was sorry I spent so much of my evening watching it. I found it tedious and tiresome (and at times ridiculous) beyond measure. As with most Kevin Costner films (whatever role he assumes - actor, director, producer), it all ends up as a tiresome exercise in self-indulgence on his part. There was no real ""story"" as such, merely a succession of various vignettes simply to pad out the time for theatre presentations - and as for that awful music, it drove me nuts. It sounded like the muzak music so often employed in Hollywood films of the 1940s - it just went on and on and on, as background wallpaper of an audio kind. It was so monotonous it hardly changed tempo or theme, despite what scenes were appearing on screen. Thank goodness film music today is often an art form in itself (e.g. Ridley Scott's ""The Kingdom of Heaven"", and many others). Definitely, this film will never make an appearance in our DVD collection, not even if a supermarket is throwing it away for one pound."
293,Casting Kevin Costner in this movie was a mistake. Not only is he a mediocre actor but using an American accent with Robin Hood killed this movie for me. The Russell Crowe Robin Hood was way better.
294,"I'm a huge Robin Hood fan, but there was something lacking in this movie that I can't quite put my finger on, but i'll try.Alan Rickman playing the Sheriff of Nottingham was too humorous, and Kevin Kosner did not convey the Robin Hood character that i've grown up with.The rest of the cast did their best, and did I hear the ""f"" word used by Christian Slater ?.Also I thought Morgan Freeman was miscast.I give this movie 2 for effort."
295,"Without doubt, the worst movie with the worst so-called 'actor' ever. Absolute garbage!"
296,"Morgan Freeman is good in everything he's ever done but the movie is to hoky. It tries to be funny and it's not. It could've been funny but Costner's not a funny guy. This was done at a time when Costner was just a face man and couldn't act a lick.. everything coming out of his mouth was monotone, as is his 'style' or lack of it. Hes still not a great actor in the present, but a darn sure bit better than he is here. He's stiff and just not the actor for this part. Don't get me wrong, I loved Dances With Wolves and it was such a good movie his acting could be overlooked along with a couple others he's done. He's been fortunate, why I'll never know, to have been in great movies so his lack of talent didn't stand out... but that's certainly not the case here. I find so many actors act the same persona in every film they do, those are not good actors... I mean let's be honest I could name off 20 leading actors and actresses that literally play the same person in every movie. They put them in the movie because they draw box office but in my humble opinion, those actors who cannot adapt to the different characters are just the worst actors in the world. It's so sickening to see it happen time and time again. Wake up Hollywood, find some real casting agents, ones who can really find new talent and great actors. I tire of this continuous joke. If they're sexy and pretty then today's casting agents think that's the key but good grief, it's time it stopped. I see so many great actors in small budget films, the new breed of Netflix and prime movies etc but they are never seen again.
All the Robin Hood movies are different and I really like this story and different take on the 'has been done 50 times movie) but Costner ruins it. You'll see 90 of 100 of my ratings on IMDb are positive but I just couldn't find much positive here. Maid Marian was great and beautiful as acted by Mastrantonio, Freeman did the best he could with a limited script...
But if your truly bored and can't find any other movies to watch, then it's worth a watch one time, but don't get to excited or you'll be let down. It's a nearly 30 yr old movie so I'm sure I've not said much new but it needed to be said again. üôÇ"
297,"Accidentally catching some of the video for ""Everything I Do"" on a music channel recently, inspired me to dig out the DVD of ""Prince of Thieves"" and give it a whirl.Robin of Loxley, (Kevin Costner) crusading son of a nobleman, escapes from prison and makes it back to England's green and pleasant shores, with Azeem (Morgan Freeman) whom he also rescued and who owes Robin a life debt. He returns to discover his father's lands taken, and the surround area under the control of the Sherriff of Nottingham (Alan Rickman). Becoming a criminal on his first day home, Robin leads a band of fellow outlaws to thwart the Sheriffs plans, feed the hungry and ultimately inspire a rebellion.So, my DVD copy of this was very old. One of the ones primarily made of cardboard, before the plastic casing eventually won the day. It wasn't the special edition, it wasn't remastered, it was essentially the video on disc, with massive black bars around the picture - so visually, this experience wasn't all it could be. . . but that's not the fault of the film. My thoughts going in were that the film was rather unfairly maligned now, and was a capable family action adventure. My thoughts now are that the maligning was actually pretty fair, and even if you ignore the most striking visual and aural negatives. It's an uneven story, that takes a long time to get going and still manages to lag in the middle. Costner's hair as aged badly, a sort of shaggy mullet that was only acceptable in the 90's and, as is common to point out, he's not really trying to do any accent. His performance is pretty bad too, which I don't think is always the case with him.The films not irredeemably awful though. When the action scenes arrive, they're actually pretty solid, a few of the visual effects remain standout, such as the ""Arrow-Cam"" and, though it doesn't quite go as far with the redemption as I thought, Alan Rickman does a great job. The score though is one part that I didn't remember (beyond the song obviously) but you hear all over the place, particularly the Disney DVD Trailer menus.It's not the worst film every made, and sadly it's one of the better version of ""Robin Hood"" in live action, but it was a better film in my memory than in real life."
298,"The obvious corny thing about this movie is the casting of kevin costner as robin hood , there is no attempt by costner whatsoever to use an english accent , the real life robin hood or robert hude as the name was spelled in some ballads was allegedly from anywhere from wakefield in west yorkshire to nottingham and he apparently died in doncaster south yorkshire, costner been a top box office draw at the time got the part and put in a good performance in for the physical scenes , but acting wise he didnt cut it for me as robin hood, he isnt convincing enough as the legendary outlaw, mary elizabeth mastrantonio is better as maid marion , as is morgan freeman as robin hoods muslim sidekick azeem , christian slater is just embarassing as robins long lost brother but the real star of the film is the late alan rickman as the sheriff of nottingham who puts in a menacing but sometimes funny portrayal of the tyrant , overall the film is ok, it has some exciting action scenes and a simple plot, the scenery and settings are interesting - including hadrians wall and some famous castles based in england but it lacks detail and ultimately the film just feels untrue and an overblown adaption of the legend and costner is no errol flynn."
299,"This film is dreadful.The geography and history take the p√≠ss. Absolutely zero swashbuckling and adventure. Terrible accents and melodrama. And Kevin Costner is woefully miscast.However, there are a few laughs to be had courtesy of Alan Rickman.I particularly enjoyed the line: ''Just a minute. Robin Hood steals money from my pocket, forcing me to hurt the public, and they love him for it? That's it then. Cancel the kitchen scraps for lepers and orphans, no more merciful beheadings, and call off Christmas''.Apparently, Rickman felt the script was poorly written and declined the part of the Sheriff of Nottingham, so the director allowed him to adlib the majority of his dialogue to get him on-board the cast. Yeah, that's how bad the picture is."
300,"Robin of Locksley (Kevin Costner) returns to Sherwood Forest from the Crusades with his compatriot the Moor, Azeem (Morgan Freeman), to discover that his father has been killed and his lands confiscated by the treacherous Sheriff of Nottingham (Alan Rickman) and his minions. Worse, the people are buckling under the the yoke of Nottingham's greed, so he sets about assembling his merry men and starting his mission of robbing from the corrupt to give to the poor, while winning the respect and love of Maid Marian (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio).On its release, this version of Robin Hood was a box office hit, but received middling critical response. Nowadays, you will find a respectable number of people who fondly recall the film with a good deal of sentiment. Part of the problem is that many critics of the time zeroed in on the miscast leading man and acted like that was the be all and end all of the film. It is not. Other charges, such as it being filled with anachronisms and not being serious enough, are laughable charges since those same things apply to The Adventures of Robin Hood (with Errol Flynn), which is considered a classic and the best adaption of the Robin Hood legend.Prince of Thieves is more serious than the Errol Flynn film - no one is swinging about in green tights. Director Kevin Reynolds keeps the action grounded and moving at a robust pace, but slows it enough to give his cast and characters time to reflect and shine. Plus this version is certainly a towering achievement over the dour version released the same year with Patrick Bergen, the misguided adaptation with a long-in-tooth Russell Crowe, and the recent debacle with Taron Egerton. For each rousing moment, we get sequences like the exchanges between Robin and Marian in the forest, where we are taken by surprise by how smart and thoughtful some of the dialog actually is.The cinematography is impressive and Michael Kamen's stupendous old-style adventure score is a highlight. While some may carp over the inclusion of a witch as an advisor to the Sheriff or the changing of the roles of Will Scarlett (Christian Slater) or the outcome of the fight with Little John, I do not believe that these impact the tone of the film and allow it its own identity away from the 1938 classic. I also like the addition of the local bishop being corrupt and in cahoots with the villains and confronted by the heroic Friar Tuck.The supporting cast is terrific. Slater is underused as Scarlett, but the remainder of the merry men are vividly cast. Mastrantonio is a lovely and gutsy Marian and Freeman provides a rich and mature presence as Robin's friend and mentor. The film is all but stolen by the grand Rickman, hamming it up delightfully as the nasty Sheriff. His one-liners may not be period appropriate, but they do bring down the house.The film's biggest stumbling block is Costner as Robin. He is not awful and carries the action solidly, but not for a moment do you forget he is miscast. He initially starts the film with a weak stab at a British accent, which sounds more surfer than Surrey, but then that token effort vanishes. Costner's career was at its peak, so it is understandable why filmmakers wanted a box office presence to head the picture, but he just seems all wrong. His stirring speeches to rouse the troops lack fire and passion. He has good chemistry with both Freeman and Mastrantonio, but his reaction to the revelation of Slater's true identity is jarringly off. Even moments he would seem suited for, he ultimately fails to deliver on, including the much ballyhooed nude swimming scene where Marian catches an eyeful of the naked Robin bathing. This would seem a given for Costner who bared quite a bit in the prior year's Oscar winner Dances With Wolves, but he opts to bestow this moment on a stand-in. So one honestly wonders how much better the film would have been with a British actor (or an American actor who could better simulate a Brit accent) who could deliver on all the requirements.That said, the film succeeds despite the faults of its lead. It is a rousing and entertaining spectacle. Certainly the last Robin Hood film worth its salt that actually reminded us of why this legend was worthy of mythic status."
301,"When Robin (Kevin Costner) and his Moorish companion (Morgan Freeman) come to England and the tyranny of the Sheriff of Nottingham, he decides to fight back as an outlaw.Sure, this Robin Hood does not speak with an English accent. In fact, the language thing is a bit of a mystery, as it seems odd the Moor would speak the same language and dialect as everyone else. But let us not dwell on technicalities that get in the way of a good story.This is very much the definitive Robin Hood. Perhaps the classic Technicolor Robin is a contender, and of course you have the Disney version. But this is the one that sticks in most people's minds today (2015). Ridley Scott tried to outdo it, but he failed miserably. Costner is Robin Hood, and who can forget that remarkable soundtrack?"
302,"I have always been a bit interested in seeing this. But the only reason I saw this was because this was in a Kevin Coaster 4-pack that had JFK. So I figured, why not? As good as the movie looked and as much promise as it had, I was so surprised just how bad it was. This is in the same league as Good Day To Die Hard and The A-Team.I do know the story of Robin Hood, but have not read it. I noticed reviews dissing it because it was too dark and not like the original tale. That portion didn't bother me, I liked the darkness this movie had. The cinematography was excellent, sets and costumes were tremendous, but all else was bad. By all else I mean the acting, script, and characterization. Every actor in this, with Alan Rickman as the exception, is terrible. Even Rickman eventually sinks to their level by the end. They have no feeling when saying their lines and seems like they're reading off cue-cards. Aside from the delivery of the script, they all look frozen with no conviction. As for the actual script itself, forget it. It could have been so-bad-its-good, but the script is cringeworthy. I think they tried too hard to make the dialogue sound from that time period. This is a British-American movie, but even the Brits could not properly deliver the lines. I thought about the lines and found out nobody could have said the lines well. Usually whenever there's poor delivery, I say the lines in my head they way I think they should be said. I tried with this and could not get any satisfactory. If they did not try so hard to make it sound old, maybe the lines would have sounded good.I love the action these medieval movies have. Despite not being very violent, the action this movie possesses is plain bad. And the characters are super dumb too who are involved in such stupid things. Watch the scene when Robin Hood teaches archery to the kid. I dare you. Good thing it had a great look, that was all that kept me from giving this a 1.0.5/4"
303,"After being captured during the Crusades, Robin of Locksley and a Moor, Azeem, escape to England, where Azeem vows to stay, until he repays Robin for saving his life. Robin's father was murdered by the Sheriff of Nottingham, who helped install King Richard's brother, John, as king while he was overseas fighting the Crusades. Robin vows to avenge his father's death and restore Richard to the throne. Even though Maid Marian, his childhood friend, cannot help him, he escapes to Sherwood Forest, where he joins a band of exiled villagers and becomes their leader. With their help he attempts to rid the land of the evil that the Sheriff has spread.....It's a pure summer blockbuster, historically inaccurate, but that only adds to the fun of the movie, arguably the best incarnation of Robin Hood, that didn't feature tights.It's comic book in many ways, from the marvellous set pieces, to the boys own antics of Robin. Costner was at the height of his game here, and it's easy to see why he was such a box office draw in the early nineties, his screen presence in this is flawless.But nothing Costner can do can stop the mammoth ham that Rickman delivers as the Sheriff. He is the reason why the film works so well. With tongue firmly in cheek, he puts in a bravura performance, delivering his lines with a sincerity that Shakespeare would be proud of.Forgiving the dodgy accents, Robin Hood :POT is a fun, if overlong ride, and still holds up 23 years later."
304,"Kevin Reynolds directed this retelling of the legend of Robin Hood(played by Kevin Costner) who is a crusading knight who escapes with his friend, a Moor named Azeem(played by Morgan Freeman) who returns to Robin's native England only to find that his father(played by Brian Blessed) has been murdered by the Sheriff of Nottingham(played by Alan Rickman) and he is a wanted man for defying the authority of the usurping King John, while the rightful King Richard is away fighting the Crusades. Robin escapes into Sherwood forest and organizes a band of exiles and bandits in his effort to oust the interlopers, and restore the lands and throne to their rightful occupants. Exciting and entertaining film is less corny than the Errol Flynn version, and much grittier and more realistic. Sure, Costner is not particularly English, but if viewer can get past that, result is a most enjoyable film, with a delightful surprise cameo at the end."
305,"I've always been a fan of the character Robin Hood. Thus I try to expose myself to as many adaptions and versions of the character as possible. This movie has a good action, and was thoroughly entertaining. The casting was very well done also with Kevin Costner, Morgan Freeman, Alan Rickman, and Christian Slater (whose name is very familiar, but I can't think of any movie he has been in). My only complaint is that Robin Hood (played by Kevin Costner) is from England, but lacks an English accent. Is it just me? I think a convincing English accent could have put this movie over the top. But all in all a very solid film, and love Alan Rickman as the villain. I also did not realize how closely Robin Hood: Men in Tights follows this plot line."
306,"Aren't Robin Hood movies supposed to be fun? Robin's band of outlaws are called the Merry Men are they not? There's nothing merry about this movie. This is a bleak and gloomy telling of the Robin Hood story. You could forgive all the gloom if the story was compelling. But it's not. Somehow they managed to make a boring Robin Hood movie. Robin Hood is traditionally such an interesting character you wouldn't think it would be possible to make a telling of his tale so dull. But the story fails to engage and the performance of Robin Hood himself, Kevin Costner, leaves so much to be desired. Costner turns in a flat, lifeless performance. He gets Robin Hood all wrong. Costner may be many things but a swashbuckler is not one of them. Robin Hood is supposed to be an inspiring character, a leader of men. Costner's Robin Hood inspires nothing but yawns.Costner's dud performance would be enough to sink the movie. But the movie has myriad other problems too. The famous love story of Robin Hood and Maid Marian falls completely flat. There is no spark whatsoever between Costner and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio who plays Marian. Robin's Merry Men range from forgettable to, in the case of Will Scarlet, incredibly annoying. Will, played rather terribly by Christian Slater, spends the whole movie acting like a whiny, petulant spoiled brat. The movie eventually gets around to trying to explain his behavior and that effort, like pretty much everything else in the movie, is just stupid. Speaking of stupid, there's a witch who the Sheriff of Nottingham looks to for guidance. Every moment this witch is on the screen is just excruciating. She's the worst character in the movie which is saying a lot because this movie has no shortage of terrible characters. The only person able to inject some life into the movie is Alan Rickman who chews all available scenery as the villainous Sheriff. He has some personality which the rest of the movie, Costner most notably, sorely lacks. This movie has no joy, it's no fun. Who asked for a dark and dreary Robin Hood? The characters are not engaging, the action scenes are uninspiring, the whole thing is just completely lifeless. The Robin Hood of legend is a great hero. That Robin Hood does not appear in this movie."
307,"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is an excellent adventure, with a bit of silliness, some romance, a few laughs, and plenty action.Kevin Costner is at his best. It might not be Morgan Freeman's greatest role, but he plays it admirably well, with a good accent, a nice straight-face funny attitude, intelligent, and full of vigor. He represent a strong black male figure anyone can admire. Alan Rickman is excellent as the evil and silly sheriff. As his despicable sidekick, Michael Wincott is just perfect. Christian Slater was good, but disappointing in his dramatic scene. The rest of the cast was on target.Great photography, nice score, good editing, interesting story. beautiful sets, nice costumes. It has everything to make for a great evening.Now for the little negative bits. Beyond the fact that Robin Hood is a mythical figure, the movie is in no way historically accurate, and the same can be said of the hair styles.Don't take it seriously, and you'll enjoy it."
308,"Once again the tale of Robin Hood is told, but this time with a more modern Hollywood feel and twist that is mostly unwanted. We start out in Jerusalem, where Robin Hood (Costner) has been imprisoned by Muslims and is more or less awaiting death as other holy warriors are murdered by the infidels. Robin gets free and frees a ""Moor"" (Freeman) rather than fellow Christians begging him and they escape with a big goofy sword. Azeem now has to honor the fact that Robin saved his life, so he tags along. I know it is just as silly as it sounds. They eventual make it to England where Robin finds out that the Sheriff of Nottingham (Rickman) has been plotting to take over from Richard I ""The Lion Heart."" Hmm what happened to Prince John? He's killed Robin's father and taken his estates. Robin meets Marian (Mastrantonio), they talk and he takes to the forest to escape the Sheriff's men. There he meets what will become the merry men, anything but it in this film. He duels with Little John (Brimble), beats him, earns the respect of the men, being a noble who has sunk to their level and defies the Sheriff. Only one seems to have a problem, Will Scarlett (Slater), who does nothing, but insult and complain about him. Later we find out why and it's stupid. They begin to rob the rich, eventually meeting Friar Tuck (McShane). Who turns out to be nothing but a fowl, bumbling drunk and a forgettable character. Eventually their enclave is attacked by ""Celts from the north"" hired by the Sheriff to get them. The commune is destroyed and many of them are taken prisoner. Will says he'll turn traitor, he goes back, fails and tells why he is so bitter. Robin you're my half brother! It gets worse when they start hugging and Robin realizes he has a brother. Will reveals that Marion is to marry the sheriff so he gets into the royal lineage (wouldn't work) and now they must stop it. They go off, save mostly kids before they are hanged and Robin Hood fights the sheriff to the death. Robin then gets married just in time for King Richard (Connery) to see the wedding, even though he never returned from the holly land, he died in France.I don't think this a terrible film, but it's not great. The modern version is much more violent a crude than most versions before this. So that gives it a tad more realistic feel than some of the others, but it's also rather unnecessary in many areas. For one, did we really need to see the Sheriff attempt to rape Marion in a semi ""comical"" scene near the end? Making the battle scenes more real I think is a plus as long as it's aimed at an older audience and not kids, as Robin Hood has for a long time has been a kid's favorite.Without a doubt the dumbest thing in the film is the edition of a Muslim ""Moor"" parading around with Robin in Medieval England. This is laughable and does not belong in the Robin Hood story. The only evidence of black Africans in England was what may have been left over from Roman slavery and blacks of Muslim faith brought back as slaves from the crusades, nothing more. Just for the fact that he is a Muslim makes it even worse, he probably would have been killed off or enslaved. The ""moor"" is shown as being brilliant in all things, war, technology and of course medicine. Much of it is utter nonsense, a telescope that did not exist and the use of gunpowder not yet used by Islam. And of course the English are all dumb, filthy dirty. What no one knows how to deliver a baby but this guy? The scene shouldn't have been the film anyway. The ""dark ages"" have much myth about them and liberal Hollywood only helps to fuel the nonsense. And why was Robin playing around what was obviously the remnants of Hadrian's Wall in southern England? Or even better why bloodthirsty Celts were fighting a tad out of time? The acting and script are nothing special. Many talk about Costner's acting, I don't think its great but what he does seems to work. And although I think the Moor character is unnecessary, Freeman as always does a great job. Rickman is the standout by far as the sheriff. I think he really comes as across as the slimy opponent of Robin. Slater seems to be just phoning it in. Probably the worst is Friar Tuck. Tuck the character is so poorly made in this film it is painful to watch. As some have stated I'm not sure Mastrantonio is the ideal Marion. She's nice looking, but she doesn't come across as being an English girl of beauty. The locations are very well done, definitely some of the brighter spots in the film. From small castles to the English country in general it does give a good feel. However it's a largely forgettable film that only gets 4 and half out 10 stars."
309,"This is a review of the 137 minute version, the only I know. When the cat is away, the mice come out and play... with King Richard in place of the feline and the rodents in that analogy being the corrupt elements of England. His Royalness is away on the Crusades(a subject that this takes a very clear stance on: that they were wrong), and one of his loyal men, the charming Robin of Locksley(a very unmistakably American-speaking Costner), escapes a prison with Azeem(spot-on performance by Freeman), through whom the attitude of respect towards Islam(not as kosher today, on account of the events of a decade after this came out) is established. Together the duo journey back to the UK and soon lead the outlaws of Sherwood forest in a rebellion against unfair taxes and the dictatorship. Almost everything from the legend is present(and the additions are nice, like the witch; and don't worry, the staff-fight is there), and in general, this delivers everything you'd expect. Fun, swashbuckling, adventure, exciting action including fencing(if some of the coverage of it could be better), camp, great dialog, etc. I'd say that this does the best job of any of them at conveying the guerrilla war they wage against the authorities. A little of the camera-work and editing are awkward, but most of it is good. The tone leans towards the lighthearted, with occasional hints of darkness. There is chemistry between Kevin and Mary. Wincott is *delicious* as the nasty bad guy we love to hate, as always. Rickman chews scenery and is fun to watch as the Sheriff of Nottingham. Will Scarlett is a tad boring in this, compared to the character and his potential... also, early on, Slater portrays him so, ahem, ""cheery"" that I have to wonder if he's why they're called ""merry"" men. The plot is engaging, and the majority of the threads are followed up on, and are interesting. I can see where Mel Brooks got the material for the spoof... honestly, Duncan, the blind servant, doesn't have that much more dignity than the one in Men in Tights. There is a lot of mild violence, some disturbing content and blood, and a little moderate to strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone who would like a traditional take on the beloved story with several modern perspectives smoothly incorporated. 7/10"
310,"I wasn't very impressed with this one. It's not embarrassingly bad, but the quality seemed subpar overall. The highlight was Alan Rickman as the villainous Sheriff of Nottingham, who was clearly having fun with the part.The movie just wasn't what I expected from a Robin Hood film. Too much focus on sorcery and the occult. The Sheriff is the master villain; there's no Prince John. The film's attempts at historical realism kind of dampened some of the fun of the Robin Hood legend. No brightly colored tights. Robin Hood is introduced as a wild-haired prisoner of the Crusades in the Middle East. The whole thing just didn't feel right. (Robin's Moorish companion allows for gunpowder to come into play. In a Robin Hood tale.) Little John leads a band of outlaws taking refuge in Sherwood Forest. Robin organizes them into guerrilla soldiers, to thwart the Sheriff's every plan.Kevin Costner's performance isn't great. (He won a Razzie for it.) Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio has a few cute scenes as Marian. The movie is dark and violent and hokey. But it might be fun as a mindless entertainment. A medieval action epic.To me, the whole thing seemed like a misfire. I guess it's just a matter of personal taste, since many people love this film. (Maybe for sentimental reasons.) Give it a try for yourself. It's not hard to sit through and there's no harm in seeing it once. If nothing else, it'll be a neat little two-and-a-half-hour adventure.5.5/10"
311,"A very weird movie. It really does try to flesh out the Robin Hood story into something more set in (a completely fabricated) history than in mythology. There are a lot of interesting ideas in the film, and it looks fantastic. But, in the end, the film's kind of a big bore. I blame it almost entirely on the actors. Costner is, of course, the biggest offender. He's just completely uncharismatic. The image of him as Robin Hood is memorable because of the excellent costume, but Costner himself is just a big blank. None of the other actors adds much to it, either, with the one exception of Alan Rickman as the Sheriff of Nottingham. He seems to be working overtime delivering a scenery-chewing villain. It's not that it's a particularly good performance, either, but at least it's memorable. The Errol Flynn version of the story is much simpler, and moves along at a clip. I expect that one to remain the best Robin Hood film ever made for a long, long time."
312,"I felt that this version of Robin Hood was pretty decent. I found myself wanting the more classic tale of Robin entering the contest, but I am alright with a different story being told. I was not the biggest fan of Kevin Costner as Robin Hood. To me, he looked out of place. Not as bad as what is to come in the form of Russell Crowe, but not good nevertheless. I found myself quite bored during the first half of the film. It felt as though the producer decided he wanted a two and a half hour movie before it was even written, then came up with a script that didn't fill the intended time, and then just put fluff where they needed more time.The second half of the film up until the conclusion was very nicely done. It was cool to see the Merry Men's village and to see how it is used. The fight in the village was good as well.The conclusion of the film felt a bit hokey. When they used the catapult to get over the castle walls, I felt like I was watching ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" rather than ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"". It was just too silly all the way through from scenes with the witch, to the statue battering ram, to the attempted forced sex with the sheriff and Marion. This film is a bit above average, hence the six rating. I wouldn't really suggest this though."
313,"Eight hundred years ago, Richard the Lionheart led the third Great Crusade to reclaim the Holy Land from the Turks... Most of the young English noblemen who flocked to his banner never returned home... The film opens near Jerusalem in a terrible dungeon where Robin of Locksley is about to show the 'English' courage... Locksley manages to escape with a fellow prisoner, a Moor called Azeem, and flees home to England... On his arrival to Britain, the prodigal son finds dark forces plotting against his absent king... His father has been slain and his lands confiscated by the evil Sheriff of Nottingham... To evade Gisborn's soldiers, Locksley heads off to the supposedly haunted Sherwood Forest, where he takes his chance with ghosts, and where he is accosted by a band of outlaws... Like Burt Lancaster in 'The Flame and the Arrow,' Costner tries to lead the woodsmen in a revolt against injustice and tyranny, but misses the youthful exuberance and passion of Dardo... Costner looks handsome as the legendary Prince of Thieves who must use his mastery of archery, siege warfare, and combat strategy to rescue his beloved damsel... Morgan Freeman looks great as Azeem, the wizard with uncommon clarity of mind, who vows to repay Robin for saving his life... His knowledge of science is a surprising blow... Mary Elizabeth Manstrantonio is Robin's beautiful and clever companion whose love for the arrogant young nobleman led her to see him taking her advice in Sherwood Forest... Alan Rickman fluctuates between being a comic buffoon and a dangerous madman... He plays the Sheriff of Nottingham who has no limit to his ambitions... Christian Slater is the hot tempered 'turncoat' with enough reason to hate Robin than any one else... Geraldine McEwan is the ugly witch who saw the 'painted man' haunting her dreams... Michael McShane is the natural charisma who would not strike a fellowman of the cloth... In fact he will help him pack for his journey with lots of gold... Michael Wincott is the Sheriff's nefarious cousin who justifies his intrusion with news of profound value: 'I met a hooded man today who made me warn you not to harm his people.' Nick Brimble is the best man of the woods who challenges Robin for his sacred gold medallion... Walter Sparrow is the loyal servant to the Locksleys who has lost his vision by the Sheriff's own cruelty... Harold Innocent is the corrupt churchman who accuses innocent men of witchcraft and let them die... There are beautiful, breathtaking, and amusing scenes: Robin's father, dressed in his black battle armor on top his black stallion, preparing to battle the 'men in masks'; sweeping shots of the English countryside as Robin and Azeem escape Sir Guy of Gisborn and his soldiers; the bout with quarterstaves across a stream; plenty of flaming arrows flowing through the greenwood along with some exciting fighting; and like Burt Lancaster in ""The Flame and the Arrow,"" who pauses in the middle of a frantic battle to plant a kiss on a kitchen maid, Alan Rickman plants his kiss on Maid Marian in the middle of his frantic duel with Costner... The majestic cameo (one of the best in epic movies) at the end of the film by a great, iconic figure, makes the movie just the right mix of adventure, humor, and romance..."
314,"Not saying Kevin Costner was a bad choice, just that he was probably not the best choice for the role of Robin Hood. I also did not think Christian Slater was the best choice for his role either. Neither did a bad job, just not the best casting in the world. However, Alan Rickman was an absolutely perfect choice for the Sheriff of Nottingham. He was such a likable villain that I was almost pulling for him in the end. Morgan Freeman is also a very good member of this cast. His character adds some good humor as he is out of his native country for the first time. So the story goes like this, Robin Hood is fighting in the crusades and is captured. He escapes with a man back to his native England, only to find that in the king's absence certain individuals are taking advantage of this by having higher than normal taxes and stealing others of their powers by accusing them of crimes. So after a period of adjustment and a meeting with petty thieves in the woods Robin goes on the offensive by doing what Robin Hood always does, stealing from the rich and giving to the poor. Good action, rather funny scenes, and an entertaining finish with one of my favorite actors makes for a very memorable time."
315,"I love the swashbuckling scenes in this movie; they're fun and by far the best parts. The humor is great, and I really don't care that Kevin Costner can't do an English accent.(SPOILERS) My major problem with this movie, though, is how Marian acts. She starts out as quite the spitfire--she knows how to fight, she's smart, and she's clever and assertive. That's a good thing. Later in the movie, though, she turns into a stereotypical weak female who can only watch and scream while Robin fights the Sheriff. I would have liked to see her do a bit more. I mean, when the Sheriff tries to force her to marry him, she just stands next to him and screams for Robin (as high-pitched and wimpy as possible). Ugh! Quite apart from the fact that it makes no sense, I just can't stand the wimpy females."
316,"I have grown up with this film and what I have learnt is that it was filmed to entertain a broad audience, which is fine when dealing with such a popular figure.Overall, it is a good film, but it lacked fulfilling its true potential.Kevin Costner's portrayal as Robin Hood was not the best choice. To me he is a very overrated actor, this is seen in this film as he was given one of the most popular English characters, yet he kept his American accent. Whereas actors such as Morgan Freeman, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Christian Slater, Mike McShane and Michael Wincott, all American/Canadian actors, were able to hold a different accent and they were not even the main character. His American accent really did not work as some of lines he delivered clearly required an English accent (e.g. Milady, a woman of your beauty has no need for such... decorations). What he really was suited for was the action scenes, as it was said that he performed most of his own stunts. If the trivia is correct Mel Gibson to me would have given a better and more realistic performance.The rest of the casting, however, could not have been any better.Alan Rickman's casting of the Sheriff of Nottingham was well done. I would have thought though that he would have brought more of a conservative and evil approach to the character, as there were many scenes that were ruined due to overacting. Such as him constantly punching the guard after Robin Hood escapes on the Sheriff's horse or the way killed Guy of Gisborne in a comical approach. Performing in theatre probably had this effect on him. What really prove his acting capability was the final duel between the Sheriff and Robin Hood, as it proves that he can do more than just perform dialogue.Other than the acting the cinematography was well shot and the locations where the film was shot, other than in Pinewood, were simply amazing.The action scenes also made the film what it was."
317,"I really hate to admit it, but I love this movie! I guess it started with being bored out of my skull with the Bryan Adams song back then (was glad Smells Like Teen Spirit was released!), but the movie stands a lot better on its own anyway. If only Costner wasn't in it...Alan Rickman is absolutely brilliant: hilariously evil! Morgan Freeman very composed as ever, Walcott very well and ugly filmed as Gisbourne, Nick Brimble a thorough Little John (he's an old 80s favorite from old Brit series), Mastrantonio lovely and sweet, but Costner is also as ever: total crap. He is totally and completely incapable of delivering with any true emotion (at all). It's very sad to see. The examples in this movie are numerous.Looking away from that (although hard) and the American accents, it is a greatly entertaining movie that brings a smile to my face anyway: guess it's the boyhood attraction to the legend.Perfect to pass a nice evening with, and sometimes that is all you want, right?"
318,"An excellent movie, I enjoyed it very much. Kevin Costner was a fabulous Robin Hood, and Morgan Freeman was good too. I thought it was the best Robin Hood I've seen so far and the movie was well made. It was exciting to watch and it never got boring or worn out. Yes, I enjoyed it very much. But they did get a few things wrong. Like, in the real story John Little was Robin's partner from the beginning. But in the movie they met later. And I don't think that there was any Azeem or Will Scarlett. But that doesn't really matter. In fact, I think that it makes the movie better. I also think they picked a good person to play lady Marian."
319,"OK....let me start off by saying that this version is not the best one. But it is pretty darn good. The supporting cast of Alan Rickman, Morgan Freeman, Nick Bramble, and Michael Wincott to name a few help to make up for some of the shortcomings.Now much has been said about Kevin Costner in the title role....""What? A yank playing a legendary English folk hero?"" Thats sacrilegious! What next....Pierce Brosnan playing Jessie James? Ewan McGregor playing Davy Crockett? It does throw one a bit off to hear Robin Hood speak with a Midwestern Gary Gooper-like accent. But if thats all you concentrate upon in the movie than you are missing out on a lot. I thought the story was strong. The acting good. The scenery and the music were good. Overall this was a very fun and enjoyable addition to the legend. Perfect, no. But what can compare to Errol Flynn's Robin Hood? Nothing. So don't try to compare this the classic. Just keep in mind that this version has its own moments that stand out and lets leave it at that."
320,"'Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves' is an action-packed adventure about the tale of Robin Hood and his gang of outlaws who steal from the rich. The story is also about the romance between Robin Hood and Maid Marian. The film has plenty of action and adventure as well as comedy and romance. Kevin Costner plays the leading role as Robin Hood, one that would continue to get him millions of lady fans for playing the hunky hero and saving the poor Maid Marian from becoming married to the bad guy. The battle scenes were quite good, even though they were a little too emotional and unreal, but that is to be expected in a movie like this. The geography is also wrong, and why does Robin Hood speak with an American accent? It's not the best film out there, but it is enjoyable for an evening. I would not watch this more than once, but that battle scenes were quite cool as a child, particularly as I enjoyed archery. However, one thing about this film really annoys me: that song at the end. I despise that song 'Everything I do, I do it for you.' Ugh!"
321,"From the first uplifting bars of the film's excellent and award-winning score, to the delightful cameo of Sean Connery as King Richard the Lionheart, the movie Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is consistently entertaining, action-packed, and full of wonderful grungy Medieval realism.I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out, (has it really been fifteen years??) when Kevin Costner was at the height of his popularity. I liked it then when I was too young to realize how ridiculous it was for Maid Marion to be wearing that suit of armor, and I have to admit I still enjoy it, despite those silly improbabilities. Critics and reviewers alike have lambasted the film for Costner's inescapable American-ness, but there are other Americans cast who don't seem to attract much negative attention, namely Mike McShane as the irrepressible Friar Tuck.Two surprising twists on the legend are the inclusion of Morgan Freeman as Robin's Moorish companion, Azeem, and Christian Slater as Robin's long lost half-brother, Will Scarlett. Maybe these two characters are just a couple more of the film's improbabilities, but their presence adds drama and modern interest to the plot.Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is a respectable and entertaining take on the Robin Hood legends, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good adventure story. Seven out of ten stars."
322,"I don't care what anyone says, I loved this movie.Don't we all go to the movies so we can be entertained? So why do people take them so seriously and trash them because of a few anachronisms or inaccuracies? OK, Kevin Costner's accent--or lack of one--doesn't count! I was more put off by the fact that he seems to start out with an accent, but loses it along the way. I'm willing to overlook a few blemishes in a movie if I can consider the time I spent watching it to NOT be a waste of my time. The more recent 'War of the Worlds' springs instantly to mind as a waste of time. This movie wasn't great, but it was extremely entertaining, warts and all. Alan Rickman is terrific in it and the whole movie has a great 'look' about it."
323,"I had heard very mixed reviews about this movie. And they are all true, there are some parts that are out of place, stupid, and lets not bring up Kevin Costner's accent. But looking past all that, this movie had a great amount of potential and I believe it delivers beautifully.Kevin Costner gives a good performance, not by any means along the lines with Dances with Wolves, but he is very entertaining as the dashing, rogue Robin of Locksley (Robin Hood) And all this drama about his accent. I would most definitely like to hear him speak his normal accent that have to hear him fail miserably at a British one, it didn't take away from the part at all.Morgan Freeman is great. He is VERY convincing as the North African Moor, Azeem, I enjoyed his character a lot, especially how he prays when everything is going wrong, very funny! He is one of the only characters that remind you about the troubles outside of Nottingham and Sherwood forest. Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves takes place during the Crusades and it seems that after the short while in the beginning in Jerusalem, the idea of war ended, but the racism towards him from Friar Tuck and some of the men in the beginning reminds you of it.Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is very very beautiful and plays a feisty, ballsy Marian. She is a terrific actress, but her character seems very two dimensional. None the less, you still root for her and Robin to get together and its a nice happy ending. And I can tell you, she screams excruciatingly loud, ""ROOOBBBIIINNNN"" I had a headache for a week, ;)But the best character of all, is Alan Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham. I have much to say about him. Probably one of the greatest villains to come along in a while. Maybe it's just me, but I grew up with the animated Disney version of Robin Hood where the Sheriff of Nottingham had that really annoying voice, humming along and picking up taxes. Rickman adds a whole new dimension to the character. Had he not been in the role, it would have been a disaster and I can't think of anyone as good as him to play this character. If you are looking for a reason to see this movie, this is it. He completely steals the show. But don't expect a Hans Gruber. The Sheriff is neurotic, sly, completely merciless ( He kills his own cousin!), and almost childish, especially in the scene where Robin cuts his face, he falls back and after at least 2 seconds starts screaming bloody murder, reminds me of my three year old cousin. Rickman steals the movie, no doubt about it. But, don't think that he just a running around yelling at people, conjuring revenge plots. He is extremely kick ass. Especially in the climatic fight scene at the end. Robin Hood: Prince of Theievs is rounded out with a great supporting cast, including Christian Slater as Will Scarlett, the outsider and hateful woodsman who has a personal problem with Robin. Nick Brimble, as the brave, jolly Little John. He reminded me of Santa Claus, before the white beard.All in all, this movie is very entertaining. Don't expect the Godfather when you see it, but I promise it's definitely worth the rental."
324,"i really enjoyed watching this movie it was really good. it has a really good story line to it and is acted really well. it starts of with robin of locksley in prison with his friends peter. they escape from the prison with Azeem (the painted man)and peter gets shot and dies and makes robin promise that he'll go see Marian. then Azeem pledges to serve robin until his oath has been fulfilled so he goes with robin. then they go to robin home and find out that while robin was in prison the sheriff of Nottingham had accused his father of being a devil worshiper, killed him and burnt down his home. So after all this robin goes to visit Marian and tell her that peter is dead and is only slightly attracted to her. while all this is happening the sheriff of Nottingham is told that robin is back and sets out to kill him. and of course robin runs away into the haunted Forrest and there he steals from the rich and gives to the poor.i will tell you no more but that this is an excellent and as a bonus it has a good ending!!!!so enjoy watching it!"
325,i would've given this movie 10 out of 10 but they cut the funniest moment out the film altogether. it was when the sheriff was getting married to marian and he gets her on the floor and gets he's legs between hers and spreads them wide. it was side splittingly funny. i could understand why they cut it if marian showed off her glory but everything was covered up by her long dress that was down to her ankles. i thought those little touches made the film and with this extended version i hoped it would be restored because it wasn't in the video on DVD I've got. i only saw it at the pictures. can anyone explain why it was cut
326,"I am looking for a leather jacket exactly like the one Robin Hood wears in this movie. Can anyone help??? It would be most appreciated. I have tried all the usual sites and have come up with nothing. Having one custom made to the specs is also possible.I would rather have an exact replica or even the very jacket from the movie which would be fantastic. Cost of course is always a consideration, but is not the deciding factor. I am from the Northwest part of Ohio, so a trip for fitting would have to be considered. If anyone can be of help , I would surely be grateful. I have never seen another jacket like it, in shops or even in films."
327,"I don't like this version very much. When it appeared in the cinemas there was a lot of hype around it and the soundtrack with the awful Bryan Adams song.The story is just too far of the original story about Robin Hood. If people want to make a sword/sorcery/romance. Then be original! It actually is possible to invent new characters and plot lines.Kevin Costner is of course a miscast in the leading role. But Slater and Freeman is OK in their roles. The best performance is by far Alan Rickman with the quote ""Cancel Christmass"""
328,"This is actually a revision of a previous review.First off, let me say that I'm a Kevin Costner fan. I loved a lot of his movies (I even enjoyed Waterworld!), but he is not the best Robin Hood I've seen.The acting was good, and the cinematography was spectacular. And Alan Rickman as a wonderfully dark Sheriff of Nottingham made the whole film for me. The film hits one really false note for me--Maid Marion. I didn't care for Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio in the part. I felt she was obnoxious and wondered why Robin of Loxley would bother rescuing her.I sill think the Patrick Bergin/Uma Thurman version is much better, but this is a good way to spend an evening!"
329,"I remember watching this film when I was about 7 and loved every moment of it.Robin Hood: Prince of thieves is not a great film, but it is a very good one. From the beautiful scenery and the costumes, to the riveting action sequences and fights. Alan Rickman is very funny as the Sheriff of Nottingham (he's an awesome actor), Kevin Costner is suitably handsome and charming enough to make any girl want to be a damsel in distress, Morgan Freeman brings much-needed warmth to his character and makes him believable.If you can look past the early 90s hairstyles, dodgy accents and the occasional cheesy dialogue then this is just the perfect film to watch with all the family and recall (if you are my age)the nostaglia of childhood. 8 and a half/10 All together now... ""Look in to my eyes, and you will see what you mean to me..."""
330,"Another excellent Costner film , back when everyone loved him. The Robin Hood story is revamped for the modern age with strong female and black characters to mirror the supposed progression of the time. Aside form Costner's accent, the film is near-perfect, but his accent is not nearly as bad as critics would have you believe, and in no way gets in the way of the story.Robin escapes from a foreign prison with the help of Azeem, a black man who vows to stay with Robin until he has saved his life as Robin did for him. Much of the soft humour in the film comes between the differences between these two characters. Robin returns to England to find his father murdered and the land under the tyrannous rule of Nottingham, played superbly by Rickman. Rickman also plans to marry Marian, who Robin has fallen for. A bounty is put on Robin's head, as well as his band of merry men who steal from the rich and give to the poor. When several of his friends are captured and to be hung on the day of Nottingham's wedding with Marian, Robin and friends attack.The plot is simple but exciting, with plenty of stunts and humour. Slater, and Mary give good performances as do the rest of the cast in smaller roles, and we cheer for Robin as he races to save Marian. One of the last good action movies of this type."
331,"I have always liked this movie. So much in fact that I have seen it over 10 times and i have had learned most of the memorable quotes - and there are many.However, there is one that has always perplexed me. It doesn't really changethe outcome of the movie, it's just one of those things that has always bugged me! Does anyone know what Little John exclaims after his baby is born in thismovie? I have always wondered. It just sounds like a bunch of gobbledy gook.If no one knows, is there an easy way i can find out?"
332,"I checked this movie out because I had heard so many things about Alan Rickman's performance and how he ""stole the movie"" from Costner. I now know what they meant. Kevin Costner's performance was, another Kevin Costner performance. I thought Robin Hood's moves were very predictable and I grew pretty tired of that goofy smirk of his. The Sheriff of Nottingham was outrageous, cruel but amusing and witty. Were it not for Alan Rickman's performance, I would have rated the movie 1 star. On a scale from 1 to 5, I would say it was a 4, three of those stars coming from Rickman's performance. The other star isn't attributed to Costner though, I give Jack Wild one star for being one of Robin Hood's band of ""merry men"". He sure has changed since his days on Living Island with H. R. Puffnstuff!"
333,"CONTAINS SPOILERSLets be frank. Any film based on an event that happened AGES and AGES ago will always be criticised for inaccuracy, wrong type of actors etc. and this one has been criticised by many for being glitched in some way or another. But I think that this Robin Hood film is one worth watching if only for the cast.I first saw this movie at the age of about 6 years old and always got too bored to watch to the end. When I first did, I was like 'OH WOW! That man has been stabbed!' To tell the truth, I was disappointed by the ending, just because it was Alan Rickman that was killed off and not Kevin Costner.I feel that this film could have tried a little harder to make Costner stick to one accent only and not switch between two like he does. It is quite annoying to hear posh-ish English phrases in an American accent or slang in a cross between English and American.I think that there is no doubt as to who steals the limelight in this film. Alan Rickman brings enjoyment to every scene he's in, storming round Nottingham castle saying things like ""Cancel kitchen scraps for lepers and orphans and call off Christmas!"" and screaming at an escaping Costner, ""LOXELY! I'm gonna cut your heart out with a spoon!""Unfortunately for Costner, the only good scenes he has are the ones where he is fighting, galloping or getting shouted at by Rickman. I thought that he was a bit on the boring side apart from his flirty scenes with Mary E. Manstrantino (that isn't how you spell her name). Like I said at the start of the review, the cast is brilliant. Morgan Freeman adds a good bit of humour and 'wise words' to the film, Costner provides a hero and an icon, Mary (can't spell the surname) is a brilliant example of a sexy female icon who is a heartthrob for the lead character (his weakness)and Alan Rickman is an ace baddie who shows that he really is evil. The story-line and the filming and the editing could have had a bit more work but all in all, this is a brilliant film that is good for watching on those late Saturday nights.8/10"
334,"Well OK, Robin Hood is largely mythical, and there is no accurate story of his exploits. Even so I wonder why on earth Kostner wanted to make this movie. All the characters are so ubelievable and shallow. It certainly is not a movie to be taken seriously. On a personal note I take exception to US film makers grabbing English stories and producing a load of garbage. If the object was to make a comedy, then why not make a movie about Gen. Custer, with say Eddie Murphy as Custer, and some blonde as his love interest. I don't know why it is that Americans even think they can master the English language, let alone try to convince us they are English. This is a terrible movie, but I suspect that anyone with a mental age of around ten will enjoy it. I certainly did not. If you've never seen it try seeing a copy of Errol Flynn's Robin Hood."
335,"Although the figure of Robin Hood has been one of the most popular cinema cult characters, there is something magical about this film, by Kevin Reynolds. It's not only the way this thrilling story is showed, but also other aspects that make this movie really memorable.First, the cast of this film are real artists. Kevin Costner wonderfully fits to the role of Robin Hood expressing his virtues in helping the poor. Alan Rickman is excellent as Sheriff of Nottingham stressing the villain's cruelty and decadence. The same can be said about Michael Wincott who portrays Guy of Gisborne very memorably combining his wickedness and ""blind following"" of his cousin. I also loved Morgan Freeman in the role of Robin's Muslim friend and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio does pretty well as Lady Marion. And Geraldine McEwan as the cruel haunting witch... what a performance! It's a pity that we don't get much of Brian Blessed's play here. He portrays Lord Locksley only in one scene.Second, there are a number of memorable moments that this film is particularly unique for:the fighting in Sherwood. The scene is made naturally and it is visually stunning. Robin Hood fighting with John the Little at a waterfall in Sherwood. There is humor combined with action and good acting.the speech of Robin Hood to his people in Sherwood: ""If you, in your hearts, believe that you are free... then we will win!""Finally, the music... It is very lively and resembles the time of Robin Hood. The song by Bryan Addams ""Everything I do, I do it For You"" is great! Really a must to listen to.This movie is not, as some critics aimed at categorizing it, a Hollywood fairy tale about the Medieval England and its hero, Robin Hood. It is an ambitious film that combines together the adventure, history, and psychological aspects of humanity. Worth seeing! Really ""azeem"" - great!"
336,"Kevin Costner plays the title role in this somber retelling of the Robin hood legend.  This film totally lacks the spirit of fun that infused the 1938 Errol Flynn version and suffers greatly in comparison.  This large budget film isn't terrible, but it offers very little to commend either. The dreadful cinematography is inexcusable for a feature with a budget of this size, and its pandering additions of a 90's-style, liberated Maid Marion and a Moorish character are obvious marketing concessions and totally unnecessary.  (Though it is hard to argue against having Morgan Freeman in your movie....)  The major problem with the film lies in the low-key performance of Kevin Costner himself, and his sometime accent.  This just isn't a good role for him.  Fortunately, the film does come alive anytime Alan Rickman appears on screen.  He's no Basil Rathbone, but his villainy is simply first-rate."
337,"What can I say that hasn't already been said before of this endearingly awful film? While it's good for maybe a long, slow, dull Saturday night, it's hardly a classic. Which is sad because judging by the amount of money that they must have spent on this turkey, it looks as if they had the ambition to make this the Robin Hood film to end all Robin Hood films. Too bad it has to end so weakly.Basically it's the same old tale of Robin of Loxley rallying the people together to overthrow the evildoers of England while falling in love with Maid Marion, but with the added touches of Robin having been away at war, his home burnt to ash, having a new companion in blind servant Duncan, Will Scarlett is Robin's half brother, and his dad brutally murdered by the Sherrif.Okay, here we go again: Kevin Costner, while an endearingly bland actor, is very much out of place here as a very American Robin Hood when he should be sounding British. Granted Errol Flynn didn't have a very well articulated British accent either, but at least he didn't sound like he was from the heartland of America. Also Costner, unlike Flynn, doesn't have the physical grace that one would attribute to Robin Hood, as he seems to stumble and bumble his way through battle scenes that require him to swing a sword (he fairs better at shooting arrows). Of course, we all know that the only reason Costner go this gig was because he was on a roll there for a while with ""The Untouchables"", ""Field of Dreams"" and ""Dances With Wolves"" and they figured they could sell this picture better with his name on it, but after this one his popularity and credibility as a box office draw kind of collapsed on itself, and he's been struggling to recover ever since. All in all, he's not a good Robin Hood, certainly not on par with Errol Flynn, Michael Praed or even Jason Connery.As said before by many others, Morgan Freeman's a good actor and his character Azeem is good as a stand alone character, but he doesn't really belong here (tokenism and perhaps competing with the Saracen character Nasir on ""Robin of Sherwood"", but Nasir had a better excuse for being there; he turned his back on the sorcerer he was working for). I think we all got a good laugh out of Alan Rickman's over the top Sheriff of Nottingham (but did he have to kill of Michael Wincott's Sir Guy of Gisbon so soon?), but you have to wonder, where the hell is Prince John? (as someone else pointed out) Because the Sheriff cannot take the throne just because he marries Marion. For that matter, where the Hell is Much? I know they said his name on screen, but I couldn't find him anywhere. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is an okay Marion, but a bit too pale and bony for my taste, while Christian Slater does what he can with the role of Will Scarlet, but while neither Slater nor Mastrantonio are very good, they both fair better than Costner, for they both display more on screen energy than their lead and they at least do a better job of faking the accent.Nick Brimble was a good Little John (almost on par with Clive Mantle from ""Robin of Sherwood""), but aside from him, his wife Fanny and Duncan, most of the other characters just don't make a dent. And what was up with the witch? Truth be told, if this had been reality, the merry men probably would have sided with Little John instead of Costner's Robin.The sets, costumes and props look great and so does the scenery and the battles are pretty good, but the story doesn't quite gel, and that sucks when your movie is about 45 minutes too long. Eliminating the subplot with the Sheriff's witch would have improved things greatly. Also dropping the thing about Will and Robin being half brothers would have improved things (perhaps they were competing with ""Robin of Sherwood"" making Gisbon and the 2nd Robin Hood half brothers). Overlong and uneven, this fails to satisfy, and falls very short of the classic that it could have been."
338,"A lot of the previous reviews, I feel, were unjust to the movie. Firstly, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio IS beautiful enough to play Maid Marian as well as being a terrific actress who portrays this character as more than some stupid damsel in distress.  Secondly, if you are going to re-do a movie or a tale as well-known as Robin Hood, you either have to do exactly what has always been done (which gets boring but people still pay) or change things around (which makes for a more interesting film).  Prince of Thieves, even with its historical inaccuracies, makes for a very intriguing interpretation of the Robin Hood tale.1.  Who cares about Costner's accent?  We all know he's American and would probably sound pretty phony if he tried one on. 2.  There is nothing that suggests that the Sheriff will ""inherit"" the throne by marryin' Marian.  It's a move that would be viewed as smart because the Sheriff obviously was trying to gain support of the nobles in England.  Marian is beautiful and ""for once in [his] lifetime [the sheriff] will have something pure."" 3.  The fact that the story sways, with Morgan Freeman's character Azim (spelling?), does not detract from the interesting stance the writers take...what was going on in the world during the time of Robin Hood?  The Crusades maybe?  What did young Christian noblemen do?  Go off to fight with Richard, the king who is present in the earlier stories.  Throwing in a Moor brings to light the superiority of the Islamic empire at the time, at least as far as medicine, sciences, and knowledge of gunpowder, though I grant that the movie does go a bit over the top in glorifying Azim as a wizard..though that is what people would have thought at the time.I like adventure films; I am guilty of being morbidly fascinated at the sight of blood.  I like watching love stories that seem to involve something more than good-looking people wanting to get on other good-looking people, though I suppose that is what this ends up looking like.  I like a change of pace, especially with actors like Rickman to carry it off.  If you like things not to change, then don't see the movie.The only part not intended for laughs that extracted my chuckles was the end credits, with Bryan Adams walking the same path as Robin Hood, holding an electric guitar, or hands in pockets, all somber.  It's a great song he plays, yes.  But that was too anachronistic for words.  (I know, I know, lots of anachronisms throughout, but that was obvious.)"
339,"As a film in itself this is OK but it strays very much from the Robin Hood story being one of the filmmakers themselves. The only real connection with Robin Hood is the name, the era and the fact that Hood robs the rich to give to the poor. Oh and he is an outlaw with the Sherrif of Nottingham after him. The events are very different. For example, Little John in the film is met with a band of outlaws behind him whereas the original story has him alone and on a bridge. Originally there were no tree houses and there was no one in the camp who was against Robin. There are many departures like this such that this is not a film for the true fan of Robin Hood.As a film in itself it tends to be rather padded and a bit slow in places. The length of the film could have been cut to make it much tighter. The sword fights are rather tame compared to the 1938 version with Eroll Flynn. Visually, however, the film has its moments."
340,"... that¬¥s what I asked myself when I saw Costner move like Pinocchio - wooden like a puppet on a string. Did anyone ever tell him he could learn to move? Watching the fencing-scenes I really felt pity for poor Alan Rickman, who had obviously real trouble not to hurt Costner. And that mirrors the problem of the whole film. Rickman, an excellent RADA-Man, had to screw down his talents for not demonstrating Costner as an absolutely ""Robin Wood"".Squandered time, this movie. I was bored. And a Robin Hood with american accent - sorry, this was an offence for my ears!"
341,"I liked this movie. I thought Kevin Costner did an okay job portraying Robin Hood, though his British accent sounded more like me after a night of heavy drinking. Morgan Freeman did an excellent job playing Azeem. I also loved the character Duncan.Alan Rickman, who is normally one of my favorite actors scared me a bit in this movie. He looks like a psycho maniac hyped up on happy pills. I would have enjoyed this movie more if his character had been a bit more realistic and a little less ""weird.""
I'm not one who looks for every little detail that is wrong in movies. I just enjoy them for what they are. And this was an average, sometimes good movie. I give it a *** stars. Nothing extremely great, but not awful either."
342,"Really, what a waste of time.  Enough has been made of Costner's atrocious English accent (was he even trying?) but not enough made about the yawn-inducing boredom present in this film.  The ""action"" scenes are weak, the plot is ludicrous, and somehow the direction managed to make even Alan Rickman uninteresting. (Love those uniform, white cloaks the bad guys are wearing, though!  Chic!)On top of the technical flaws, the historical ones are worse.  Morgan Freeman's black African ""Moor"" in the holy land is suspect...but not as suspect as his tattoos.  He would have carried a ""cross hilt"" sword at that point in history (scimitars having not yet taken over Islamic armies) and, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD--a lecture from a Moslem about the treatment of women?!Note to one of the previous reviewers about Americans doing English accents: Keanu Reeves is Canadian, so please don't blame us."
343,"Great story, Great song, Great set, Great acting, gives this one 8/10 for me.  I sadly spend too much time cowering behind the sofa to fully enjoy it. I really must learn not to shriek so much at all the blood!!  I watched this on T.V the other night and had forgotten just how gory I actually find it!! Shame."
344,"This may be blasphemy, but I enjoy this movie more than the Erroll Flynn version. This movie does a better job of presenting the conditions that the people in not-so-Merrie Olde England faced. I couldn't care less about Kevin Costner's accent; he holds his own (How come no one fussed over Christian Slater's accent?). A fine cast and an entertaining movie."
345,"Well, I can say is that I don't see this movie since I am 15. The reason is mainly because I never felt like seeing it since then, and my video tape collection is getting a little dusty (the dvd era has arrived). But I can that when I was that age I saw the movie several times, it was one of those movies that I had playing in my bedroom even when I was doing other things. But I never got tired of it, probably because the movie has all those qualities of a good blockbuster, with an extra bonus: it picks the story of Robin Hood and decides to skip the green tights section, which gives it a cool twist, transforming the known story into a dramatic action flick, with violence enough to compete with all the other summer action fests. The overall result is pleasant: Morgan Freeman's Azzeem is a cool sidekick, and Alan Rickman's sheriff is the best thing about the picture. However, there are flaws, and even if Costner's main role is a charismatic vehicle, the feel is that he betrays some of the englishman's origins, starting with the accent, which he should have kept. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio keeps on showing that she is more than just the love interest like she did in ""The Abyss"", but a sweeter role would have fitted a lot better. So, this movie has a kind of a raw feeling, which may annoy the purists. At the end, this after all a typical summer blockbuster linked to a known historical figure."
346,"Director Kevin Reynolds' version of ""Robin Hood"" is the best in my mind by the smallest of margins over a couple of others. Kevin Costner is super in the titled role and Alan Rickman steals every scene as the crazed Sheriff of Notingham. Good supporting turns by Christian Slater, Morgan Freeman and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio just add to the adequate screenplay. High production values and some really exciting sequences are the things that set this one apart from lesser versions. 4 stars out of 5."
347,"Kevin Costner and Morgan Freeman are really cool in this swashbuckling, medievil fight between Robin Hood and the King.  The performances were really cool and the action sequences are even better.  The arrows flying, the sword swinging, and all sorts of cool fights that would entertain any action fan.Overall the movie is really cool and the plot is good.  The acting was great and the directing was good, too.  The best though is the action sequences. Those were interesting.  Rating 9 out of 10."
348,"I am a big fan of this movie although I can see where the negative comments are coming from. I saw this when I was really young and have been a fan ever since although Kevin Costner is pretty bad in this film.  The film is also historically inaccurate.A lot of people have given Christian Slater a hard time saying that he put in a terrible performance.  Funny, I thought that he was one of the best actors, although obviously not as good as Alan Rickman and Morgan Freeman. (This may stem from my love of Slater though)Mary Elizabeth Manstrantonio really irritated me in this movie and I really wish that director's wouldn't put things into movies just to make them more politically correct i.e. A very strongly charactered Lady Marion and a Azeem.My favourite scene's in this movie have to be where Will Scarlet finally tells Robin that they are brothers and where Robin is catapulted over the wall with Azeem (I don't know why I like this scene, it's just fun)One more thing, did anyone else notice a bit part role by Jack Wild who played The Artful Dodger in Oliver, its when Robin is in the waterfall and they are trying to stop Lady Marion from seeing him, I couldn't believe it was him."
