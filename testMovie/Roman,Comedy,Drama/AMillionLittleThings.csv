0,"Honestly, I love this show. I loved it from the trailer. I dont understand why so many people are giving it low ratings. Honestly, this is how people talk. All the awkward poses, all the awkward writing... If you actually listen carefully to how people speak, you'll realize that this show catches that at best. 
I love it. Will continue to watch it. Hopefully it gets even better."
1,"But rather about adult depression, not feeling whole or enough, with emotions and thoughts and fears which you don't share even with the ones closest to you, pretending to be happy but feeling alone and hopeless inside. 
If you are an adult, not like legally adult but been through some stuff throughout your life, you will definitely find someting here.
I would have definitely binged this one if there were more episodes."
2,"The first episode was as promised...an emotional drama. I was tearing up almost immediately. I felt compelled to write this review because of the negative reviews I'm reading on other sites. I think this show is deeper than it seems on the surface. It does focus on a touchy subject, suicide, but it is something for which we could all use a better understanding. I think too often we are caught up in our own worlds to see what's going on around us. There are many people silently suffering and living behind a facade of fake smiles and glitter. You never know what someone is going through. Hopefully this show opens peoples eyes, hearts and lines of communication about emotions and depression."
3,"Went into this show expecting an updated version of The Big Chill. I grew up with that movie and soundtrack in our house and wanted to feel that connection my parents felt to that movie. The show is beautiful and tragic but I think the glue holding it together is James Roday. He gets it and he has ""it"". His scenes feel so real and grounded that I find myself wanting more of his storyline. I am excited to see how this show is able to carry over a whole season and I am hopeful Roday has some nominations coming his way."
4,"I thought this show was an accurate depiction of the fight with depression and how it really can touch everyone. Someone with depression may see this show and identify with it right away. Or, possibly see the effects of what they leave behind. Granted it is a dramatization but still for someone else suffering, very accurate. Gone is the cookie cutter families that have a perfect life. That's not real. People can have real discussions because of this show. I appreciate the hot mess mom shows, or the shows show adultery (including the guilt), the co-parenting shows, the Hispanic loud families, or even the new shows that portray the problem with the medical culture. That is real life. We need more shows to shine a light on it so we talk about it. Instead of shoving it under the rug and acting like it never happens."
5,"I hope this show will help start a conversation so many never want to talk about, laugh it off, or turn away from...just shake it off. I am one on the other side screaming for help and never being heard by therapists or family (as I have no friends, seriously)...in fact my mom said I should not watch it as it will impact me. Be in a good frame of mind...sorry but when you cannot see the horizon is there ever a good frame of mind? I thought the cast and story lines were right on...as well as the song choice playing throughout parts of the show. I hope folks will watch and start a conversation with friends they do have. And give the show a chance...it may help you to understand and answer a question or two. And for now just listen is all and let someone know they are not alone. I have been living alone...really just existing in life with every day being a struggle.... for what? ...maybe a show like this to come my way for a reason.  For the critics out there...Yes I am and have been in therapy for years as a suicide survivor and idioligist...but get no where and left unheard...leaving me with different questions.Everyone has a story...One kind word or gesture can make someone's day...even your own just by doing one small thing. Yes I told my mother I watched it and thought it was on point and it hit home for me right down to the song...and too bad therapists don't listen either...and I got back...told you along with a crying emoji. Watch and see...it may just start the change..."
6,Show is off to a good start. A couple moments are a little rough but James Roday really carried the pilot. Excited for more to come
7,I love almost all the characters on the show and their stories. Great acting and very interesting storylines. However I find myself fast forwarding through the Maggie scenes with all her fits and crying and they've made her personality cringeworthy.
8,"I watched this show based on my love of ""Psych"" and ""weeds"", but I was extremely surprised and excited to find such a heartfelt and warm show for this fall. It's new idea of mental health gives accurate,representation of today's current struggles with the everyday person along with finding family in the people you stumble across in life. I truly believe in this show and hope it continues. Stunningly beautiful."
9,So good! It is a drama so definitely need tissues but I expected that. So bad reviews have mentioned 13 Reasons Why and This is Us as comparisons. Yes it is a drama like This Is Us and talks about suicide like 13 Reasons Why but it is a completely different show then those in my opinion. Everything happens for a reason and we are sure to find out all the reasons throughout the season! I'm excited to keep watching!
10,I have mixed feelings about the show. Overall I felt most of the acting fell flat. I did however really enjoy James Roday and his character. He was my favorite by far. I'll be tuning in for the next episode.
11,"If you are the kind of person who mainly watches network television, you'll enjoy this show. It is a good show, for network programming.....But if you have been exposed to higher quality dramas and entertainment you'll have a hard time fighting the strong odor of cheese coming off the screen."
12,"This is one of the few good ones they are putting out for us. Characters are believable and multi layered like real people. Good choices for actors. Subject matter is delicate and handled well. This is a topic that needs addressing and is done in good taste. I found it easy to relate to these characters on many levels. I like that it shows reality that even seemingly successful, happy people have problems and it's a good lesson not to judge anyone."
13,"Just curious, but does the character of Theo annoy anyone else? What kid acts that way? It seems so unrealistic and I find myself rolling my eyes. Can any of these characters smile or be happy? It seems depressing all the time."
14,How many people slept with each other and how many kids did they have? It's gotten ridiculous. We're not watching anymore.
15,"Never seen ""13 Reasons Why"" and do not plan too. As heard it ""glorifies"" suicide in the wake of the deaths of Anthony Bourdain and Kate Spade in 2018 June.A successful businessman and married father of two, Ron Livingston commits suicide as hopefully we will find out why he did and that suicide whether you are successful, working class, married, single, etc.Great ensemble as David Giuonti(Grimm) stars as a father who's marriage is strained to Grace Park(Hawaii Five 0), with a young son. James Roday still shows comic relief like he did in Psych but also balances seriousness due to the facing of breast cancer as 1% of men have it in the USA.Romany Malco who character is going nowhere until he gets the call of his friend's suicide and his TV wife, Cristina Moses as a aspiring chef who wants to open an restaurant and somehow does near the end of the pilot and you will have to see why.Last but not least Alison Miller as a potential love interest for the Roday character and a breast cancer survivor who also happens to counsel those who are depressed. Hope it will make it. And really just hope it shows how people go through healing and may never come to terms with it. But it is about trying to move on."
16,"ABC response on NBC ""This is us"", ""AMLT"" in Season 01 was interesting experience about the group of friends that doesn't quite understand why their friend chose to end his life, no matter most of actors in ""AMLT"" can't act. But, in season 02 it was even worst - it's just like all characters changed their personalities.Rating Season 1: 7+
Rating Season 2: 4+"
17,"The only things that could save this show from the dumpster fire it is would be to get rid of the insufferable, depressing, horrible acted Maggie and John Ritters horrible character and drop the disgusting homosexual child storyline."
18,"This show was amazing for season 1. It was compelling and had great characters. The finally was awesome. But in season 2, things started to go downhill really quickly. The series turned into a sappy, incestuous, soap opera.For me, it was clear they ran out of material in the episode when the power went out in the restaurant. But it seemed like it might be worth the time to check out one more episode. Then ""Unleashed"" happened (S2,E6).SPOILERS!!!************* SPOILERS**********In ""Unleashed"" the script was a schmaltzy disaster, coupled with a heavy-handed and melodramatic director that made dramatic scenes laughable. Literally, we were laughing out loud at the supposedly dramatic moments.The inciting incident of Gary's dog running away, was given outrageous importance! The whole gang assembles with great desperation to find the dog. It had the urgency of searching for a toddler who had been abducted. Wow. The energy, thanks to the on-the-nose script and the insanely heavy directing, made the drama into a farce.When Gary runs a stop sign and gets pulled over, he is so wildly over the top that you would think the cop was literally going to find cocaine in Gary's car. But instead, the cop turns all ""Howdy Doody"" in an instant, letting Gary off with the most cliche apology ever.That's just one tiny example of the whole show's tone.When the entire group is running down the stairs in slow mo to see the dog, it was almost like a Saturday Night Live sketch. NOBODY would do that. It would just be like ""Hey, they found Garys' dog, awesome."" And that would be the end of reaction.I felt bad for the actors having to do all this silliness. Like when the son has to hold the daughter's hand to pretend they are a couple. C'mon, that was just stupid, especially since we never saw the girl's reaction when he grabs her hand. And the dad yelling across the street from his car window was comical. He looked like central casting... ""Time to insert the shot of the dad."" It felt like a bad script note.Overall, this script and directing were absolutely caricatures, schmaltzy, and beyond trite.The very best elements of the series are the casting, the sound mix, the production design and the cinematography. The acting is awesome. It's a shame to force all that greatness into a dopey soap opera.Loved season 1, but I'm outta there."
19,"This is a terrible show. I'm strangely fascinated enough to keep watching although I laugh and shake my head the whole time. It's trying way to hard to be ""important"" and the earnestness is just way over the top. I am basically watching it as a comedy at this point."
20,"Everything was good until they threw in a twist and sent an 8 year old it on a date with another boy and the mom and uncle offers no guidance, nothing other than adoration and praise. Every show on television doesn't have to toss in a homosexual child. Let children just be children and stop preaching the gospel of the militant lgbtqiaaxyz. We want to be entertained not Indoctrinated."
21,"Overly serious, completely irritating characters, designed to do nothing more than depress."
22,"I was really looking forward to this show and they didn't upset.One thing that is really pisses me off is why is the assistant hiding the note?Maybe it has something in it that will totally turn all of the friends against one another.I don't know. But I cannot wait for the next episode.It seems like there is a lot of negative reviews on IMDB. That is to be expected.The people on here think they are experts and we should listen to what they say.I say, watch it for yourself and then comment."
23,"This is the most depressing series there ever was. No one is ever happy in this show. The kids are miserable, the adults are miserable, every situation elicits a mellow dramatic over response. If you find yourself too happy and need to bring it down a few notches, tune in and watch A Million Little Things."
24,This show is the definition of sappy and cliche. The acting is awful and the writing is even worse. No part of this show is realistic to relationships or the average persons life. White privileged people living white privileged lives... and the worst part is that not all of the characters are white! Does this accurately depict the struggle of African Americans or working mothers or cancer or depression or the affects of suicide?? NO it does not.
25,"This is a story about a group of excruciatingly thin women and overly-emotional metrosexual men, who don't seem to have any worries over money, creating problems for themselves to add drama to their lives for no good reason. Spends a lot of time on one particular woman with cancer who they became emotionally invested in the moment they met her, which shows how needy they are to have something useful in their lives, I guess. Cute blond woman doesn't want their attention, but still gets it by refusing to do what they want her to do, so she has a group of almost strangers begging her to get cancer treatment while she teases them with her illness. That is really sick. I gave it a chance. Taking it off my DVR record list because of extreme sappiness and dark, depressing story line that never goes away."
26,Need to dial back on the self pity in each character storyline.
27,"I usually don't watch shows like this, but I wanted to give it a go because I like Ron Livingston. He's not in it much, unfortunately. My issues: the back-slappin' banter between the male characters is WAY too cheesy (as others have already mentioned). I want to slap the guy with the beard. The women? They all talk in that phony, whispery breathless tone - not one woman I know in real life talks like that. And the music is empty, vacuous smarmy crap. I'm still watching, hoping I'll find something to like enough to want to keep watching, but it's torturous. Ugh."
28,"I feel like I'm watching the worst soap opera ever made. I watched it only because I was bedridden for 4 months in the hospital and my iPad was my best friend. I TRIED to like/ love this series. I USED to love the actor who brilliantly portrayed Shawn Spencer on the tv show
"" Psych "". It's embarrassing watching these actors . Such over the top acting and it turns my stomach. I'm surprised they actually approved a second season! Anyway ( NOT anywayS). I'll be really surprised if there is a third season!"
29,I cannot watch this show for the same reasons I cannot watch This is Us. It's very clear they are looking to capitalize on that fanbase with this show. It's a plodding drama with what I consider to be real life situations that are impossible to culminate all amongst one group of friends.
30,"Started off great but now I am into season 2 episode 5. All characters are knee deep in self pity, narcissism and depressing situations without any fight to climb out. Come on, lighten up a bit!!!!"
31,"Well this show is intense, a bit of a downer, it also has a strong message about suicide and life and the people that all of these things affect. I thoroughly enjoyed the show great acting, very well written and I definitely can't wait till next week!"
32,"I am about to give up on this show .
Had so many hopes and all
Have been shattered . 9 episodes into the season and there have been no consistent story line to get hooked on it . Wasted almost 3 episodes on ""back and forth"" about Maggie's treatment ( unbearable reasonings ) . She is an adult and has a right to choose . Let her be .Gary , excellent actor , but very flawed character . What is his source of income ? Actually , that's the question to almost all the characters . Only person shown working diligently is Kathrine . But they spoiled that storyline by adding ridiculous ""2 hr evening time off "" getting rejected by the law firm . That's totally unbelievable .What to say about Jon's wife ? The most selfish person and totally clueless about his work and hasn't asked one intelligent question to the secretary about money / business ? So
Is the secretary running the business now ? Aren't the customers asking who
Is the the decision maker ? And what's in the packet ? My patience is running out ."
33,"I get that this show is trying to be another ""This Is Us""..... enough with the music!
Every time someone says something, we know it's ""going to be important"" because the music starts, and we are supposed to let our emotions go.... except, all I can think of is, I wish the music would go away so I could hear the dialogue, and decide for MYSELF if it is causing me to get emotional..... Not every phrase uttered has to be ""touching"" or ""meaningful"", because, it isn't!
Every man is such a ""guy"", all back slapping ""super"" friend, or ""not worthy enough"" friend.... The women all have to speak in that breathy, whispery voice, unless they are having an outburst, then they sound like a normal human.
I'm wondering when the secret of Jon will emerge, is he the head of a drug syndicate? Child trafficker? Cheating husband as well (vibes from the secretary/assistant)? Serial killer? I can see maintaining the image of perfection maybe caused him to leap off the building, I'm hoping it's more, or else it seems like Jon was sick of doing 99.9% of the friendship work, while everyone else was waiting around for is latest grand gesture.
Pizza night also needs to be implemented by our world leaders, because after potentially years of secrets and betrayals, hey presto, ""Pizza Night"" is back on! We're all friends again, woohoo!!!!"
34,"I don't understand, where is this good rating from? Boring. Poor acting and boring."
35,"It's a decent show but highly forgettable.I liked that they were going to explore suicide and depression but they didn't. They gloss over it and don't show the nitty gritty. Obviously depression isn't the same for everyone but it's deeper than the show portrays.However, my biggest annoyance with the show is how literally no one cares that one of the ""best friend"" Bros was sleeping with Jon's wife. Delilah and Eddie were forgiven waaay too quickly. Jon was supposed to be the glue and everyone LOVED him but no one cares that he was betrayed by his wife AND his best friend? No way.I started watched solely for Grace Park but she's barely given any scenes and when she does, her character is being torn apart because she...works? She is a lawyer and lawyers work. Eddie stays home to care for their son which is admirable but when Katharine goes to work to support their lifestyle she's a workaholic monster. It's unfair. I'm a stay at home mom and my husband works a lot so I understand feeling lonely but I also respect the hell out of my husband for supporting us.The show has potential but it's put together in a very cheesy, unrealistic way"
36,Enjoyed the show. I do believe that everything happens for a reason.
37,This is not This Is Us. I don't see the similarities at all and I'm a big fan of This Is Us. The show deals with a very deep subject that many people don't want to discuss. It reminds me of The Big Chill which was a great movie.
38,What a unique show. It's an incredible combination of drama and life. Put the phones down and sink into the episode. Keep the conversations to a minimum. It's worth the isolation. You come out tuned into a very different perspective of the world.
39,"I like David Guitinoli, which is why I watch this show. Everyone tries so hard and it is so dramatic, almost to the point of overwhelming the audience. I think the producers are trying to bank in on the success of This Is Us, but the characters are unrealistic and over-the-top. At times I found myself saying out loud ""enough"" - don't take yourselves so seriously."
40,"I have watched since the beginning and waiting for something anywhere near happy to happen. This is the most depressing show I have ever watched. After every episode I feel depressed. I like the actors but would love to see something positive happen. Still waiting to find out what John's assistant is hiding. Then there is the focus on cancer in every episode and her choice not to seek treatment, why get involved in all of these peoples lives if you have made that choice? And then get upset when they don't accept your choice. I am not sure how much longer I will continue to watch, every week waiting for anything positive. It is a shame because as I said, I like all the actors."
41,"10 minutes into the first episode and it is achingly clear that some execs watched 'this is us' and decided they wanted something similar. Except, this is a cloying and sappy knock-off that tries every trick in the book to bring the feels. No thanks."
42,A great show so far that pulls at your heart at every turn. Really enjoyed the first two episodes! Really wish I could binge watch MORE!!!
43,"So glad to see my favorite working in another series, David is really a great actor. He's so good in Grimm. Also love to see Grace Park again after years in Hawaii 50"
44,"Loved the show at start, then we've gone too far. Friends with past lovers who had a child together was far enough , now actually babysitting for her that too too ridiculous. The final end is condoning and celebrating a gay son. enough I'm done"
45,"A topic like suicide, in my opinion, needs a writing style and character portrayal that are raw and genuine and that was not to be found here. The characters, with the exception of Roday's, were dull, safe, and pc. Even when they tried to convey emotion, it didn't seem realistic. It seems like the errors made making this show were all across the board. The characters were miscast, the writers were too inside the box and unwilling to take the necessary risks to tackle a topic like this, and production/direction couldn't manage to steer all this mismatch into the kind of show this should have been. Kind of like a car with all the wheels out of alignment."
46,"What a stupid show! First of all, they show Katherine as someone who is disinterested in the group in the first episode. She showed zero interest in Jon's funeral and she was the least effected by it it. But some how. she changed so drastically and instead of hating Delilah and Eddie for the affair(which was for 2 YEARS), she is even nicer to them. Her character made no sense and I ended up hating her towards the end.The biggest blunder of the show....Jon's BIG SECRET and the reason for his death. We waited for 17 episodes to find out there was no big mystery. He was just depressed about his friend's death who died in September 11 attacsk and the financial problems tipped him over the edge? Why was Barbara Morgan even a big secret? She had nothing to hide! Why was Ashley even trying to hide anything? She could have just told them the truth. They would have understood, why was it a big secret?! So stupid.Wasted my precious time watching this crap."
47,"Oh wow, did the first episode suck me in?? It sure did, it was intense, it was a must watch, had to find out how this all came about. But it also sucked me in to thinking this was going to be great television, entertaining and dramatic, HOWEVER, what unfolded, before my very eyes, is exactly what some others have alluded to in other reviews, the characters were simply not likeable, they were worse than that, they were irritating and fake and that goes for the kids too. One other reviewer put it nicely, 'people don't speak like that', the whispering and melodramatic lines delivered, which seems to be prevalent in many shows these days is just God awful.Gary is at the top of the list as irritating,I honestly wanted him to shut up. How could Maggie have so much to do with a family when she has only just arrived on the scene? Eddie just cheesy (there is that word again, able to describe so many sins) Depression takes many forms, but Rome couldn't convince any viewer that he was actually suffering from depression, and just when you think his wife might be one of the group without any monsters, out they come, yawn!! Delilah can whisper her way through a day time soap, or alternatively assist someone with sleeping issues. Katherine was the closest one to not annoy the viewer. The gay 8 year old story was just cringe. Eddie and Katherine's son had nothing endearing about him at all, cast as the cute Asian boy...it didn't work. How could so much happen to one set of cheesy friends over a short space of time. Another reviewer also summed up my position ""I'm strangely fascinated enough to keep watching although I laugh and shake my head the whole time wondering why I am wasting my time'.Thankfully I recorded this so I could fast forward and was desperate to see how it unfolded at the end. i should have known better, a cliffhanger to suck me in for the next series....I will not be making that mistake again. Its schmaltzy and tries way too hard, truly awful."
48,"I'm very close to removing this show from my DVR. I tried to hang on long as I could, but the story doesn't seem to be going anywhere. When it started, it felt like there was a direction in mind. I didn't know that it would just be drama for the sake of it. The storylines are dragged out and tedious. It feels like the writers have lost an overall sense of purpose.Between the never ending Gary-chase-stubborn-Maggie repetition, the whitewash of philandering Delilah and Eddie, the forced and disturbing make the little boy gay to check a quota box, and the bizarre Rome begs perfectly healthy wife for a baby so they eventually adopt, it just feels drawn out to the point the audience can't care about it anymore.Beyond the poor writing, the poor acting is something else that makes the show hard to watch. All of the actresses except for the one who plays Kathryn, do a mediocre to poor job. The actors are a little better but not enough to save the show.If this show is to survive, I think a shake-up is in order, on both the writer end and the acting end. Maybe get rid of some of the weak links. Start with the Maggie character. Not sure I'll stick around to see it turn around, but I think that would be a good start."
49,"Maggie annoys the dog s*** outta me. Very dull, and stubborn. I do feel like they are trying really hard to make you emotional but I haven't shed a tear. They latched on way too quick to Maggie for my taste. I just wanna see how the baby storyline is going to go"
50,"I saw a post recommending this show if one was a fan of ""this is us""....the first episode actually related very well to this is us and was truly promising to turn into quite a good show.
However, I'm half way through the first season and I've got to admit I find myself physically rolling my eyes at pretty much every scene.
The script is sloppy, the acting is tardy and there is almost no chemistry between any of the characters.
I feel like this show had so much potential but is completely missing the mark.
I will watch until the end of the first season because I want to see where the cliffhangers lead to and how it ties up, but I think that's where it'll end for me.
Would not recommend this show to anyone really. Unless you like over dramatized cliched television shows."
51,"Watched first few episodes with interest but it has gone downhill as the season progresses. Season 2 is unbearable, stopped watching after this week. Characters are annoying and acting is terrible. Virtue signaling is predictable and not authentic. James Roday is only thing redeeming about this show."
52,"Tries to hard to be dramatic - does no one know how to talk? Why does everyone just get mad?
Tries to hard to be funny - everyone is full of silly one-liners."
53,Pilot was interesting it kinda pulls you in. Gary is a great character but the show's too depressing man. I'm out.
54,"I just watched the premier and had tears in my eyes within minutes. This amazing cast did a wonderful job pulling us into this story of friendship and life's many challenges. Suicide is something that many people are are uncomfortable talking about. This show illustrates how common these dark thoughts are. It gives us a show to reflect on with our own friends that can hopefully lead in to deeper conversations about mental health & personal struggles. If people are not comfortable with the show because it's ""depressing"" that is different than saying it's not a show worth watching. If you have an emotional reaction good. Use that to open up important dialogues with loved ones. I look forward to future episodes, to learn more about these characters and what got them to this point, to see what they do after this tragedy. If you are struggling with depression or thoughts of suicide call 800-743-TALK or text 741741."
55,"Badly written, this is about suicide, and no emotion. No one acts like someone even died. The wise-cracking character - should just shut up!! Don't waste your time. Sorry I'm sure it's not the actors' fault. Just a bad scripts and dumb story so far!"
56,"I will admit it. I watched the entire first episode and there was absolutely nothing that appealed to me. This show is just so over the top depressing. I believe the ABC network was attempting to copy and capture some of the real magic that its competitor NBC's multiple Emmy award winning TV drama series ""This Is Us"" brings to its large audience week in and week out. Unfortunately the writing in A Million Little Things is terrible, and thus the actors just seem to be reading their lines without any real emotion resonating with the TV audience.I think both the production crew and the main actors took a giant leap of faith that they could pull off another great dramatic TV series like ""This Is Us"". When they all got on that magic carpet ride and took their leap of faith they forgot to pack a parachute so when the audience watches the first and maybe the next few episodes as well, the landing is going to be messy just like the pilot episode was.I honestly cannot rate it any higher than a 2 out of 10....and no I am not working for or against any TV network, I am just a film goer and TV viewer sharing my honest opinion."
57,"I haven't given this fluff piece enough time to even learn the character's names. It's not worth the effort to even scroll back. These writers were definitely on a Hollywood High when they devised, wrote and actually produced this nonsense. I knew going in to it that someone in this multi character, drama for lack of a better description, was going to commit suicide. For a better suicide story, try the Big Chill or my annual Christmas favorite, Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"". It no where near as sappy as this mess, plus there is a story line. The best part of it is the suicide itself, stolen directly from IaWL, sort of. They used an office building instead of a bridge in their (spoiler alert) jump cuts. What's in the blue folder that is kept from us? At this point, I don't care. The Yin Yang necklace? Oh that's not the widow's. It's her lover's who was picked for the Father Daughter dance by the dead man's daughter, who ended up dancing with the film maker who is way more obsessed with this more than anyone ever should be. The twist started with him in episode 1, attempting the same demise, but with all sorts of pills that he spits out upon hearing the bad news about his friend. He loses his therapist for some reason only she can explain, but her parting words of advice to him were ""In a relationship there is a gardener and a flower. You need to become the flower."" What does that even mean? Back to Hollywood High and Ken Kesey's Merry Pranksters bus to figure that one out. That was it for me. If you want to continue, go for it. I'm going to rewind The Big Chill. Maybe there is a clue in there."
58,"First, as others have said, I like the actors. I've also continued watching to find out what the mystery is with the ""dead guy"". After the last episode (1/8) I just don't think I can continue.The symptoms they are saying comes from untreated breast cancer, even if it metastasized to other areas are just not real. I didn't think it was right so I searched it up and I couldn't find anything even remotely close. Bruising and skin sores on the back and shoulder blades??? What?? Maybe during some treatments or non related medications but not without any treatments or other medications.Seriously who wouldn't do a little research about a subject before writing a show like this one. It just makes everything else they claim suspect. I'd also like to point out the the male with the Mastectomy still has both bumps that show under his shirt.It's offensive to anyone who has gone through this ordeal. To myself, a survivor of 5 years post treatment, or anyone who has had a loved one go through this or any cancer.I can't speak to all the depression but if they massacred it as bad as the cancer then who knows the type of side effects it could have for people.Shame on you ABC!"
59,"Just not a fan of the characters or script. Lots of potential, but not much realized. Not even comparable to the complex, clever, touching writing of This IS Us. Just yuck."
60,"Does every show on television have to be about forcing the gospel of LGBTQIAAXYZ down our throats, especially the new ""cool"" trendy thing of forcing homosexual children on us. TV was about entertainment at one time but now it's all about indoctrination.Sending an 8 year old boy on a date with another was unnecessary, didnt fit and felt forced. PC culture ruins everything it touchrs. This is anee low. Where do we go from here? We've already reached the bottom."
61,I don't watch the series but somebody told me about season 2 episode 14 (The Sleepover) so I've watched it. Why is it not OK for a 13 year old boy and a 13 year old girl to have sex in a parents house but it is for 2 boys? I immediately thought Disney but discovered it was ABC but further investigation shows that Disney owns ABC. Walt would turn in his grave.
62,This show is so depressing. The dialogue is awful and the acting is worse.
63,"Firstly its a very talented cast. Secondly its a very talented cast, beyond that honestly in My entire life I have never heard any conversations like the ones that are thrust upon Me while viewing this show. Some have knocked its theme as compared to other shows exploring suicide, but all that aside I really think the core problem in My opinion is the writing. Its clever, but every line is clever its a barrage of cleverness. Its just to much. I just watched the 2nd episode and I feel dizzy. With this talented group of actors this could be an amazing show. Its just to manic. Sequence after sequence, scene after scene, same pace. Writers need to give the dialogue and story flow time to breathe. PACING.. The director could play a big part in bringing this production to a palpable level but at the end of the day its all about the words and how they are put to paper.I have just finished the 3rd episode and I have to honestly say it was decent. The manic pace, ridiculous dialogue and over cleverness of the first 2 episodes seemed to have been cleansed. It was almost as if the writing staff had a shift change and a different director took the reigns. I will give this show a chance, especially if they bring the Lovely Grace Parks character into the mix. All that being said I know good or bad this show will be a major hit. hopefully good.!!Okay I'm not done .. after sitting through the 5th and 6th episode. My final thoughts are as follows.. the writing is just ludicrous.. its as if the staff tries to throw in every imaginable dilemma that could befall a relationship between a couple a family a group of friends. Its just absolutely ridiculous. I'm old and I have seen a lot of drama unfold in my life, but this is just to much. People just don't behave like this in the real world. Ask Yourself how much time has elapsed from the pilot to the 7th episode and then add up all the earth shattering events that have befallen this group of people.. its just not logical or believable or palatable. Its just to much to stomach. Its such a waste of a great group of acting talent for the most part.All that being said I'm sure this show will find an audience and will be picked up for multiple seasons."
64,"The content of this show may be heavy, but it's so moving. Just what I need right now. I hope it can stay this good as it goes on."
65,Nothing appealed to me at all. Seems like they are trying to appeal to the This Is Us crowd but it's done terribly.
66,"I'm not a big fan of emotional drama in general, but there's just something about this show.. 
Every line, every tear, every smile, everything seems real and most importantly true ! Finally a show where there aren't perfect families living their perfect lives, but real people struggling with depression, cancer or lost."
67,"James Roday and Ron Livingston are two actors that I have a lot of respect for, people whose work that I have enjoyed in the past...so it hurts writing this.But, let's be honest, this is a dramatization of suicide not unlike 13 Reasons. It doesn't exactly glorify it, but it does send the loud and clear message that killing yourself is a tragic action that makes you deep.And the actors involved are really above that.It's probably going to be a hit, the Millennials are going to love it...but honestly, its an overdose of melodrama about how deep people that kill themselves are, and that is all it is.There are much better shows."
68,"This show, just like 13 Reasons Why, is so necessary in today's world where people still can't openly talk about their mental health concerns without being shamed or disregarded. Nothing about these shows glorifies anything and those that say such things are out of touch with the reality of depression. I'm grateful that shows like these are being made to further the conversations that should be happening between us and our loved ones. So far I'm really impressed with this pilot episode and I'm looking forward to seeing the next one."
69,"Honestly, why are we allowing a prime time show to openly have an 8 year boy say he likes another boy and his mom and uncle encourage it.
Can a child wander the streets alone without being asked where there parents are? No. And why not? Because they need someone to guide them, give them direction to keep them safe.
You can tell your children what you want in your own home. It's irresponsible to air it on public television."
70,"I find melodramatic schmaltz tiresome, so I didn't like this show."
71,"Another over the top, over acted night time soap opera about grief and friendships. Good concept, but it is just all for nada. James Roday trues to upstage in every damn scene. Cancel this turkey"
72,"One of the best relatable shows about the ups and downs of being human that I've watched in a while. Life is messy and chaotic, happy and tragic..this show hits every high and low perfectly."
73,"This show brought tears in my eyes and had me with a lump in my throat for the entire pilot. Good casting, good performance and some unsuspecting twist and kept me wanting more of ""A Million Little Things"". 
I would strongly recommend this show to anyone as it ranges and can relate to everyone."
74,"I was hooked on this program during the 1st season. Interesting story and great acting. Rated 9.Just changed rating to 4. Acting is still very good. Unfortunately, has become another soap opera.No longer watching."
75,Everyone getting upset over nothing. And the writers practically BEG you in every episode to cry about John.
76,"I enjoy the show's backstories and individual characters. So diverse and fun to watch events unfold. However, I struggle with Delilah's character and especially the interaction with Eddie. I don't find either of them likable even though Delilah seems the most vulnerable. I'll keep watching and see how her story plays out. Same with Eddie . . . Just . . . Can we not keep putting them in the same space for no reason, to make dumb decisions or to show fake lust tension. Too obvious possibly. Kind of made me not watch for a couple weeks. I'm back, let's see if I get surprised or if its all just predictable."
77,"I just binge watched the first 2 seasons on hulu. I thought the first season was amazing, and dealt with some pretty heavy topics, but thought Gary's humor added some comic relief from sadness. The second season wasn't as good as the first, but good enough to keep me watching. They added in some characters, for at least half the episodes that somehow disappeared without a trace. Rome's new best friend PJ just disappeared, as well as possible love interest for Deliliah, (the guy the helped out with the restaurant that had the wife in the coma) Maggie's sudden obsession with the guy she thought had her brothers heart was just weird. The situation with Eddie's sister and what happened at the lake house looked the last few episodes looked like it was just thrown in there the last minute so there would be some sort of cliff hanger for the end of the series. With all these little things that bugged me, I'm still a fan and can't wait for the new season."
78,"It seemed like they didn't know what's to do so they started do invent so many crap and lost me .....
""This is us"" is enough ."
79,"Based on the Pilot.Be ready for a truly sad attempt to make you emotional. They've cramped so much misery and sadness in one episode that it is impossible to 'keep track', not to mention that the script is all but funny. Awkward is the right word I guess.The key ingredient to This Is Us is finesse and tactfulness.That said, the premise isn't bad and like many say: Give it a chance. Perhaps they felt the need to give a lot of background from the get-go. So I am hoping this turns into a bit of a (murder) mystery. Will do one more episode."
80,"It is really tragedy this year, after ""this is us"", we have ""sorry for your loss"" and now ""a million little things"".Is it that deep? Deep enough to get tears? for me no.
It didn't deep enough to touch my heart, my feelings, they were just friends for 10 years, not the one who sleep next to me or share the same blood.They try really hard to get people cry, it shows! 
All the acting is deliberately want people to feel sad, and have some tears. If the joke is not that funny, we don't laugh, and if the story is not sad enough, we don't cry.Cheating, depressed, disease, suicide, those are not good and proper reason to share tears with."
81,"It has been a long time since a show came along that I can not wait till the next episode. This is defiantly one of them. You will laugh you will cry. It is a show you can relate to. Great choice of actors, they all fit in there role perfectly.Amazing show. An absolute must see."
82,"The acting is only consistently good from James Roday and the dead dude, the dead dude doesn't have too many parts. No doubt, James Roday and the mystery surrounding the cause of suicide, is keeping me watching this series. Reminds me of desperate housewives, maybe could be retitled to desperate husbands. If you like middle class soaps, then this is for you. In a sentence, a good filler in while waiting to watch something else."
83,"Please please move this show to any other night but Thursday. Thursday used to be the best night ever to relax and watch ABC for three hours but Scandal came to an end and the fire show spinoff was not good. A million little things, really, how I relaxing. Please put something good on from 9-10 please."
84,"I'm tired of people watching 1 or 2 episodes and coming on this platform and slamming a show. Either watch the entirety or shut your mouth. Most shows need a lead up into the meat of the program, if you can't wait.... watch the Kardashians (no plot and you get immediate drama). And to those who say this is a This Is Us wannabe, yes it is a drama program but that's where the similarities end. Different plot line, different characters, different emotions. But ultimately, if you believe the reviews of someone who couldn't be bothered to actually give it a chance, don't listen. What movie critic would you believe if they walked out after the first 15 minutes......"
85,"The writing is trite and predictable, and the story lines and character relationships are so forced and contrived. I tried to get into it the first season, but, with season 2, I've come to realize that I do more sighing and eye rolling than enjoying the show.Besides the terrible acting, the characters are all so flat and unimpressive and everything seems so forced, particularly the emotion and sentimentality. Which brings me to the writing. Ugh, the writing. I'm guessing that there are zero black voices in the room when it comes to the story lines and character development. I know in the era of equity, diversity, and inclusion Hollywood wants to throw marginalized folks into every show, but, unless you have the appropriate writers (and listen to them) and directors, it comes off as if these characters are Affirmative Action hires at a super white corporation. Regina and Rome are seriously a fist bump away from a ""You go, girl"" or some other old, tired ""urban"" phrase.Basically, this show is what happens when old, privileged white men (and their female counterparts) try to create a drama with a ""diverse"" cast (blacks, check, Asian, check, interracial romance, check, gay teen, check) and a unique plot--dry, boring, unrealistic tokens and exaggerated, ridiculous story lines."
86,"I think a lot of people thought this was ABC's attempt to pull over some of the THIS IS US audience, that had really charted a new course in drama. But, I think this can stand on its own if you stop making comparisons. The idea for the show came out of one of the writers having lost a friend to suicide. It began with a catharsis, of sorts. Good decisions were made for cast. The writers wrote characters with depth and some great character arcs were born. The performances matched the writing. I think this is a good drama. I give this series an 8.5 (really great) out of 10. {Drama}"
87,Could of been good. Premise was good. Characters were good. Liked the actors. Writing was bad.
88,This show is truly amazing. All of the negative reviews you may see I believe are categorically untrue. It's a beautiful show with tons and tons of heart. Just when you think you're done they pull you right back in. And it's about more than just suicide. It's about friendships and love and hope and all of the million little things that help us get through life
89,This show is so great! It has so many twists and turns. This is a show you want to get hooked on.
90,"The writing is terrible. The acting is alright. This show could be really good if they would stop trying to be the next ""This Is Us""."
91,"Engages every aspect of real life! Love, friendship, cancer, suicide, family, kids etc etc..."
92,"Reminds me a lot of '30 Something'. But am so pleased to David Giuntoli in a decent show.Very, very annoyed it has no UK broadcaster. I had to buy the DVD's from the US. Hopefully Amazon or Netflix will pick it up."
93,I look forward to this show weekly. They have really developed the characters well.
94,"I love the story line, but seriously just get to the point!!"
95,Love this new show and the cast! One of my new favs!
96,"I absolutely loved this show from the opening scenes! I was hooked and it didn't let go. I may be alone on this one but it honestly reminds me of ""Thirtysomething"" which I also loved. The concept that even when it looks like we have it all, we all have pain. Hope it survives."
97,"Too many times men are portrayed as one dimensional buffoons on modern TV..I get it...its sells. But I am really, really tired of it. Watching men with depth, pain, and feelings was SO refreshing. Judy Berman in TIME started with a shallow review but finally got it right in the last paragraph. Shows like this might even help battle the Brett Kavanaughs of the world. Give men a chance to grow, especially on TV, and lets see what happens. We all win. LOVED THIS SHOW. As a man, as a dad, as a viewer.."
98,"So just like ""This Is Us"", it's basically an hour of sorta witty quips, 80's song remakes and spoon-fed emotional situations. Granted, as a 43 year-old guy, I'm probably not the intended audience, but I can't help but imagine a group of chicks in their early 20's watching this show together and saying ""awwww"" in concert every 3 minutes. It has fleeting moments that make me laugh, and then it's right back to the emotional ham sandwich. Imagine a soda can being the one hour for this show, and then taking an object the size of a turkey that represents emotion, and then watching someone try and fit that turkey inside the soda can.... that's this show."
99,"What a great show, I can relate to some of the characters. I really hope they keep this going!!!!"
100,"I like this show a lot. Emotionally, its very similar to ""This Is Us."" But, T.I.U. has begun to feel manipulative to me. I just can't sit through those episodes anymore.This show has enough mystery and intrigue between the characters that it keeps me hooked. Looking forward to the fall for the story to pick up again,"
101,From the very first episode I was completely hooked because it's so true to life. People kill themselves and their loved ones are left behind to pick up the pieces. I adore each and every one of the characters and I can't wait to see this show unfold! It needs more advertising though...it popped up on my Hulu Lineup which is the only way I found out about it. This show is too AMAZING to get cancelled because of lack of advertising.
102,"This shown already has represented depression and suicide in a very honest way. It's not something that happens in vacuum and the show shows that depression is more common than you think. It also shows how everyone around the deceased could blame themselves and how they react, whether right or wrong. The peformances are already compelling and feel real."
103,"This show's air date was my son's birthday and came a month and a half after I had attempted & survived suicide. And prior to my attempt, I had lost a life-long friend to suicide. This show made me look at & face things in my own life that I wasn't seeing. The one on one meetings between Maggie & Roman... OMG!! It was like watching myself in someone else's shoes! The part where Maggie made the gardening analogy in reference to Roman needing self-care & to 'be the flower, instead of the gardener' just gave me feels in my soul! Sometimes you really NEED to see & hear things from a different point of view to really understand & ""get it"". I am getting help for my depression/mental health and doing a lot better now with treatment & support. But for real, this show grabbed me by the heartstrings & into my soul in the first 7 minutes of the pilot episode and hasn't let go!! I think I'd be lost without this group of people!! Especially, Roman, Regina, Maggie and Gary!"
104,"I absolutely love this show, it may have started out a bit slow but each episode gets better and better. I love how the characters are developing. I am recommending this to all my friends. I think it's right up there with This is Us."
105,"While the subject matter is depressing, as it should be, I found the first episode to be pretty realistic (bringing a booty call to the funeral is interesting, but it may fit his character). I look forward to learning more about the characters. I really like Ron Livingston, but I'm sad that his character will probably get the least amount of time onscreen. It never bodes well for a show I'm invested in, so I pray ABC gives this show a chance."
106,"Really enjoyed all the storylines! The show takes you through so many feelings, thoughts and emotions that anyone could be going through today. I have recommended this to all my friends, and several have thanked me!"
107,"This show is like Friends on depression. Some of the actors plays really bad their roles. And the characters are always taking selfish choices and then crying about it, but when their friends have some problem they give wise advices, I mean if you are so wise why your life is such a disaster?
I give four stars because every time I have insomnia I put this show and sleep instantly. So thanks for the bad show that cured my insomnia..."
108,An amazing show. I look at a lot of shows but it's been a Long time since I saw somerhing as good as this. Just waiting for season 3!
109,"While watching ""A Million Little Things,"" I often wonder if this show's creators/writers are people like me: a 90's child who grew up watching ""Friends,"" hoping that someday when I and my friends were adults, we'd have fun, almost glamorous lives like the group shown on that show, but now that I've matured past the age of the characters on the original sitcom, my real middle-aged life has actually been much more like the lives of the characters in this drama, with serious issues like suicide, alcoholism, cancer, money issues, etc. and unfortunately much less goofiness. However, the main concept of both these shows is still the same: adults getting by in this world by leaning on their friend groups.To carry the comparison further, the characters in these two shows can also be paired up:
-There's the respected professional with a successful white collar career on the one hand whose family situation at home is messy on the other hand (Ross/Katherine)
-There's another professional who seems to be doing well financially at a poorly-defined office career who's also a goofy man child who is convinced he's the funniest member of the group (Chandler/Gary)
-There's one in the entertainment industry who isn't quite where they want to be yet, but keeps trying (Joey/Rome)
-There's the woman who thought she'd get to be a pampered housewife for the rest of her life, but then her marriage didn't go according to plan, so now she needs to become a career woman to support herself (Rachel/Delilah)
-There's the artsy musician who isn't quite making a living off of their music (Phoebe/Eddie)
-And finally the chef trying to make it in the restaurant business, whom the rest of the group rely on whenever they want feeding (Monica/Regina)In addition, some of the story lines are similar, but obviously done much more seriously on the drama than the sitcom:
-Two of the friends sleep together, resulting in an unplanned pregnancy
A pair of the friends are married and pursuing an adoptionOverall, a quite good show that speaks to both a generation's issues and the affect a solid group of friends can have on each other's lives."
110,"A reasonable premise for a show, and good acting. Unfortunately, the characters, for the most part, have been directed to overplay the drama. Every situation they encounter is a crisis. Gary is the worst; the very definition of drama queen. I've noticed that every time the group gets together for a supposedly fun time, someone's feelings get hurt and someone stomps out or is ordered out of the gathering. Please, lighten up!"
111,"Finally, a show that tackles real life issues from every point of view, including children's. Hopefully, it doesn't end up getting cancelled like other great shows. Downside, I definitely have experienced trigger's with each episode, as someone who has had to deal with suicide more than once throughout my life involving people dear to my heart....so be careful watching if you are also easily triggered."
112,"It's a bit similar to a successful drama series ""This is Us""."
113,"I had high expectations from the all-star line up, Roday, Giuntoli, Livingston, Park ... disappointed in a big way. This show can not be labeled a comedy, the plot is just too serious and depressing even for drama. The entire pilot is without a single funny moment. It seems to be modeled on shows like ""This is Us"". Maybe it's a decent show for some, but I found it quite boring."
114,"Ron is a good actor!! He made people laugh in Office Space!! He played a great roll in Band Of Brothers where he learned how to become the man he was portraying by talking to his widow & learning all he could!! Then he takes the roll in this show!! Suicde is a real problem in this world!! Why do a show about someone killing them selves!!! That's a cowards way out and a selfish way out!! We all have struggles in life, prettmuch everyone has hit rock bottom in life, it most carry on and fight!! Best what I just put about killing oneself, it also destroys those you left behind mentally!! Even if a letter is wrote saying what & ""why"" they did it still leaves real questions on why from those left behind!! They are always thinking if it was them or something else for the suicide!! The constant grieving. That leads me to where this show is now!! The first two episodes were ""grieving"" & now they have moved on to where one of his friends is dating a woman with cancer & she is telling him she is giving up & giving in to cancer. She won't do treatments this time around!! Next is one that's just got swept from his wife, (a PC) relationship & he is staying with the guy who is dating the cancer girl!! The other friend quit his job & he was telling his friends he had quit when they find a pregnancy test in the trash. His wife isn't pregnant but the widow of Ron's character is the one pregnant & she was cheating on her husband, so who will the father be!!! It was not dealing with the loss of a friend,father,husband anymore!!"
115,"I think this new show, A Million Little Things is headed for a second season. Provides a message to all of silent suffering and depression. This is a show that will give insight and lessons to learn. I enjoyed and scheduled on my DVR to be taped/"
116,"I love this show, really enjoy the entire cast and the story."
117,I was pleasantly surprised by this show. I hope it gets to stick around & tell us the whole story.
118,"This show feels like it was meant for me. It deals with many life issues but depression is the one that spoke to me. It really shows both sides of depression/suicide. It made me feel like I was not alone anymore. Because of this show I finally told those closest to me about my depression and finally sought help for it. For all the people saying it's trying to be the new ""This is us"" you may want to note that ""this is us"" was the new ""parenthood"". This is us didn't invent drama about real life issues so stop comparing and just give the show a try."
119,"This is a really incredible cast with many stories that are all connected. I don't see a similarity beteeen this show and This is Us. Anyway, I think you will love this show. It shows that men can and should really show their love for one another."
120,"Great screenplay, actors, music.. If you like series like This is Us , then this series is for you. Totally loved it from Episode 1!!! The plot twists will surprise you and you won't want to miss an episode. Can't wait for the new episodes and hope it will get a season 2. Don't miss it! No negative comments. It's perfect! Well done ABC."
121,"I love this show, and am sticking through it. But I will admit that I am not a fan of ""Delilah"" and her lifestyle. Same with the secretary ""Ashley"" and her secrets that concern everyone. These two are so poorly made that I almost quit from them. They lie and lie and lie to everyone they care for and feel no remorse. They had this ""soap opera"" feel to the show which I am not a fan of. Hopefully you all can handle them because up till the season 1 winter finale, they are still the snakes of the group."
122,"No words can describe how good this show is!!! It's a piece of art! I hope it stays at realistic and emotional throughout. I'm a grown man, in tears every week. Maybe I just need to speak to someone. 😕
The cast is amazing as well!"
123,I love this show but really is Katherine the only one who ever works?
124,I usually don't watch these type of drama shows but a few of the cast members I like so I checked it out. Yes it is a very good show with one storyline dealing with suicide and how the family and friends left behind try to figure out why and try to heal from the tragedy. But for me the story line with male breast cancer hits home. My dad is one of the 1% of male breast cancer patients. So thank you for shining a light on this unfortunately little known fact that it is not just women who get it and have to have mastectomies but anybody can.
125,Finally some adult TV with some substance. I absolutely love that this show takes invest some very difficult topics.
126,One of the first shows I've seen that deals with depression in an appropriate way.
127,"I have to change my review of this show. It uses all the manipulative, tear jerking, moronic knee jerks when it comes to how bad things can get. Yes, every time something half way decent happens, something worse follows it. HOWEVER, all in all, this show addresses topics that are taboo: suicide, depression, marital infidelity, guilt, cancer, death, homosexuality, self doubt, etc. It goes there even though sometimes it's unrealistic. I've been up and down all season with this soap opera drama but the season finale gave me hope. It finally gave the title true meaning. I'm looking forward to S.2 of this overly dramatic take on life."
128,"I really like this show! It is delving into the difficult realities of life, & how each situation or life story or depression or suicide needs to be coped or managed, faced head on, or to just stop and listen. Another reviewer tried to relate this to This Is Us - what? This makes absolutely no sense. This is a show all of its own. The little ones things are the stern contrasts of the experiences and extremely difficult challenges that people would rather hide away and never discuss. This is one of those shows that makes you cry, and even though you hate to cry or face these issues, you just can't wait until the next episode! This is a must see!
I'm also very impressed with the acting - incredible group of professionals who are displaying each & every facet of emotion perfectly."
129,"I don't understand why this show hasn't been picked up for an entire season. I just love this show, i love everything about it. It is my new favorite. I sure hope abc picks this up!!!!!"
130,WHY IS THE RECEPTIONIST HIDING THE THINGS FROM THE FAMILY !?!??! Ughhhh I tried to not like this show but dammit it do
131,"The show captivated me from the beginning, i can relate to it and to the characters and it is emotional. I think the acting and texts are great and that anyone can relate to any of the characters in one way or another. lets hope it keeps up being great as it is now (ive watched both episodes that aired just now)"
132,"What a waste of talent. James Roday is great. But the overloaded dramatic stories are utterly ridiculous. I will continue watching bc I also like all of the actors except for the woman child playing Maggie. She looks 16 and is automatically taken seriously as a)an adult b)a therapist whom NOBODY KNOWS AT ALL and c)the storyline with Gary and her not wanting to get treatment. As a therapist, after losing his best friend to suicide, it is inconceivable that she'd have no problem doing EXACTLY what their friend did - but in über slow motion and making her new friends suffer for it. Selfish much?? Her storyline is the worst and dumbest and inconsistent storyline out there. And on top of this drama - she plays games? Like a mild case made-for-tv Fifty Shades of Grey but this time with really stupid head games. Also, suicide guys daughter? Wayyy over doing the rebellious daughter. Not every kid is a selfish jerk. I wish they could have written her out of stereotyping.
So I like Romany Malco, Grace Park and the cast is good. Except for the child actor playing grownup. Ugh. Please. Let the cancer take her."
133,"I've watched the first episode and was hooked. since then i've watched the both episodes and rewatched them, bought the season pass and can't wait for more. i get something deeper out of each time. hands down one of the best shows in years, it truly hits on the secrets of our hidden troubled times in the world today. it gives us hope and shows how we are connected. definitely a must see show. bravo!!!"
134,"...................
Friendship, Mystery, Family packed in good way.
..................
.......
....."
135,"Great show with excellent acting and topics that rarely get discussed at all, so I was very happy about that.It was deep and funny along with some suspense, so this show is unique, since you rarely get all 3 in one.My 3 complaints:1. They showed clips at the beginning of one of the episodes of scenes we never saw from ""last week.""2. The direction was off in some places, but then it got better as the series progressed.2. It pushes the mainstream methods of beating cancer and depression. I know other shows do too, but they are usually medical shows. This one wasn't.It focuses only on toxic drugs & chemo when there are holistic non toxic methods for both cancer & depression.In fact the script was sooo pushy, that both the person with the cancer & the person with the depression were pushed to take the chemo & drugs from someone who loved them.One even said take the drugs for depression for me because I worry.WOW, do you know how many people are addicted to & damaged by drugs for depression when depression can be dealt with using non addictive and non toxic all natural products?And chemo kills good cells, NOT just the cancerous cells, which is why so many people who have cancer & go for these toxic conventional methods end up getting cancer again in a different part of their body.Yes you can heal cancer naturally. There's been a cure for cancer since at least the 1950's.Healthy holistic anything was mentioned twice during the entire 17 episodes & only as something ""weird."" This made me wonder who was funding this series.I thought after both characters refused the chemo & drugs that they would eventually come up with the holistic methods, but nothing.Despite that, all of the issues in the show need to be discussed, like men not communicating with their male friends, feelings, suicide, depression, hiding the truth, & how good communication skills save almost every relationship.Since they focused heavily on that, this is why I feel this is a must watch for everyone.I'm very glad they renewed it for another season."
136,"I know this will get downvoted because OMG HOW DARE I STATE THE OBVIOUS, but have noticed that as far as Gary's past conquests - which have so far been shown as being with women of color (the black and Asian women) - he treats and dismisses them like trash but the 100-pound blonde he almost instantly becomes obsessed with and in love with in a day basically. Whoever casted/wrote this (cause I don't totally blame the actor, a check is a check) has some issues. The rest of the show, however, has been interesting so far."
137,"Please leave the little I-can-do-anything-better-than-you chick in Oxford. Please! Seeing who her new roommate is, I can see that she isn't going away. They wouldn't have him there if he weren't going to play a major part. He'll get involved with her and Gary will get jealous. I don't know why they added the little baby girl to the mix to always remind everyone of the affair. And how very selfish not to take the second baby to adopt with the other couple (I'm not good at names, particularly imaginary ones.) If he doesn't forgive her I don't blame him. I'm hoping that I can find something else to distract me during this time period. I don't like the show and Maggie bothers me a LOT."
138,I loved this show the pilot dragged me in but the family drama is so epic that happens in all families but the suicide is a+ that is for real scenes that also happens in most family's I luv all of the characters each is unique in its own way. I hope we have a lot of seasons as greys anatomy.
139,"Is a show about life,friends,decisions ,can be anyone life, so is good to watch it and to learn about life, about people around us.Is giving good lessons."
140,"This one is so warm, funny, exciting and fun serie. I think the best with this one, is the actors and figures playing. I feel like it's a group of real friends in the real world who do thing together. How they interact with one another it's breathtaking! They're playing so good. I recommend this to Every one who wants a quality series!"
141,"This show captured my attention early on and I'm really intrigued by it. My family suffered through a suicide and that's why I started watching, but I've come to really like the characters and their stories."
142,"As a lover of Grimm and Psyche, you can probably imagine how ecstatic I was at seeing my favorite actors once again - and in something so warm and engaging. I love the characters - Yes, James Roday is best, but they all get their turns. The kids are good without being cloying, as so often has with child actors. I'm irritated that Season 2 ended in a cliffhanger and there's no word yet on whether a Season 3 is in the offing. Stories and actors, though, are awesome, and I sincerely hope that there will be a Season 3."
143,This show is so important in our modern age. A Million Little Things is one of those rare shoes that depicts mental illness in such a real and raw way. The struggles these characters face are just so real and I really love the character development throughout both seasons. This show is really wholesome. I just love it.
144,I love this show. Amazing writing. Incredible actors. Great storyline each week.ookibg forward to seeing what is in store for Gary. I like the new chick. Can't wait for it every week.
145,I honestly love this show. i loved it from the begining till now hope it continues .and hope it gets better
146,I love this series but tonight's season finale kept me on an emotional roller coaster. Relationships unraveling? Being knit together? Wait till next season? That'll be a challenge.
147,"I love this show. The first few episodes were filled with so much emotion that I was at first thinking it was going to be such a downer of a show but this show is just so real. So much about real life and wach and every character you can relate to. Each week it just builds more and more and you can relate to each episode. Even if you haven't lost someone to suicide, there is so much more than just suicide that this show is about. It's about real life and what people are living in their own lives. Most people say why do I want to see my life in tv but it helps you to know that other people have the same fears and dreams and struggles."
148,"Without a doubt 1 of the very best shows on TV now & in recent times. Real life happens & they share it with us each episode. Man, I love this show."
149,Cried like a baby every episode. Pulls real hard on your heart strings. Gets people talking.
150,"The song on tonight's season two premiere, "" You Were Made For Me, I Was Made For You,"" was so pretty! Who sang it?"
151,"Honestly, this story taught me a lot. These characters suprisingly has high Emotional Intelligent. As a sometime emotion stunt person and to everyone who has no idea what to do during emotional situation, i say watch this. I was learning along the way. Plus the plots and the actors are great. I love the actors here. Their expressions just wow. since this is emotional story, face expressions are important and they nailed it."
152,Best show! I'm so happy it was renewed for a second season
153,"I get the premise of the show but I'm so over the fact that you are not in 2019... you know where we have IPhones and iPads. It's no longer 2001, where as a Nation, we were grieving the loss of hundreds of people. Why bring us back to that time of crying for all those that were lost? No it's 2019. I do enjoy the show but I don't get going back in time to do so!"
154,I honestly thought this show would suck but its is a great show and I cant wait for season 2.
155,I love this show. Just startef watching srason one on demand. It has bulk to it and the characters are real live issues. Soo good.
156,"Storyline is excellent and well developed! Plot, characters acting superior! We've been waiting for a story this well woven!!!! Bring it back !!!!!
I just love watching this unfold. I'll be binge watching again until season 2!"
157,I've loved this show from the beginning. I look forward to watching this each week and it's the only show that is recorded! Can't wait for it to come back on
158,"If you are not comfortable with the issues going on in the everyday lives of people than this is not the show for you. Suicide, depression, cancer, relationships between couples, children and parents, friends, facing life threatening diseases including severe depression or substance abuse.. are all very real. The writing is unpredictable as life can be, this is not the new ""This Is Us"", the sob story line there could not hold my attention. THIS SHOW... is raw and relatable, and encourages survival, communication and compassion. I love everything about it and I hope it is around for a long time."
159,Wonderful casting and perfect storylines. My personal favorite is James Roday who is just an all around good actor.
160,"Finally a drama worth watching! I love the friendship and how everyone is always there for each other- does it happen in real life? I would like to think so.
I had something in my eyes that made me tear up a few times too"
161,This show amazes me each time I watch it. It's wriiten so well. I honestly believe it is one of the best shows on tv right now. It deals with so many real life problems and I feel like it's helped me get through my own life as I can relate to more than one character on the show. Definitely worth watching.
162,"Awesome Show! Love The Characters, Inspiring! Season 2! Can't Wait!"
163,"After the first ten minutes I was skeptics based on the immediacy of the central issue, which sometimes turns me off of things cause I don't expect anything else to matter. But it essentially just builds off of the first problem and shows that everyone has layers and problems and some level of mental illness and need."
164,Writers are great. Actors/Actresses are great! It's about what people experience in REAL life. An absolutely amazing series!
165,Great characters and storyline. Many twists and turns and we are becoming endeared to the characters. Just wish they'd stop the shaky camera.
166,"To start off with a suicide that affects a close group of male friends along with their families and relationships may sound trite; but this eclectic ensemble has given the story-line the ability to morph into an intricate web of social relationships that expands far beyond it's initial premise. With its excellent directing, this seemingly unusual group of characters explores the full range of human emotions, frailties and triumphs that few shows can manage without losing their balance. This tapestry of this modern tale manages to unravel and re-shape its pattern with each episode. It has a solid core that takes the viewer on an emotional journey with a continuity rarely seen in network TV. As a seventy-four year old man, I look forward to this ensemble more and more with each episode: it touches the soul."
167,This show had me hooked from episode 1. It is raw and touches on every day real life issues that people face. It is emotional and gets one thinking. I can't wait for season 2!
168,Wasnt sure I would like the show but I Love It! It gives real life truth of things we all face everyday.
169,"This show has it all! Drama, suspense, comedy, And heart. The chemistry of the actors is spot on. When the show Parenthood ended I was so sad and wondered if there would be one that could stand up to it and this has definitely met that standard."
170,"Just finished the last episode of Season 1. It's a great show. It gets quite heavy now and again, but it's filled with real, raw human emotion. Sure.. it's a bit cliche at times but pretty solid writing throughout, regardless.
Love the cast too. Some great acting moments. The only casting problem I have is Gary and Maggie being a couple. He seems like he'd be better slated to play her Dad.. but I still enjoy both their characters and what they bring to the show.
Please have a season 2! This show is just getting good!"
171,"Basharah I completely agree with you. This year has been the first in a LING time that I've watched network programming. There are so many good ones on locals now!! Where have they been. A million little things is in my top 3 of must watches. It's always throwing a curve ball yet these group of friends ban together when needed. It's funny, has great music. People that gave it low ratings must have not given it much of a chance. It's awesome!!! Please renew for a Season 2!!!
Other goodies on local prime time are The Good Doctor, This is us, New Amsterdam, The Resident and Manifest, not necessarily in that order. I'm just so pleased that local channels have FINALLY given us some shows with some ""meat"" to the stories."
172,"This show will grab you by your heartstrings! Being a big fan of This Is Us I have this show a try and love it ! It deals with some tough topics like mental health, cancer, divorce and dealing with grief and does so in an eye opening way. A Millon Little Things is the drama I have always looked for."
173,"If you watched the pilot, you were hooked literally within the first 10 minutes. Four guys who formed a friendship when fate stuck them in a broken elevator. Suddenly, years later, one of those friends (Ron Livingston as ""Jon"") chooses to end his life by committing suicide...and no one saw it coming. How his death effects those friends, as well as his family and their circle of friends, is the basis for the show.David Giuntoli (Eddie) is listed first in the credits, but IMO, James Roday (Gary) has grabbed most of the attention to this mid-point of Season 1. He is comfortable delivering both the drama as well as the clever comedic moments, and his budding relationship with Allison Miller's (Maggie) has been romantic, funny, and downright serious and scary all at the same time.At this point, the linchpin in the series has been Christina Ochoa. Her character, ""Ashley"" has been nothing short of riveting. Ashley was Jon's secretary, and sadly witnessed his demise. But as we're finding out more every week, her character runs SO much deeper than just your ordinary secretary. She was Jon's right arm and confidant, and her involvement with him is just now being revealed. No doubt there is MUCH more to come.I am SO looking forward to see how this story plays out. It truly gets better every week."
174,"Great cast, and a great story! Every week, I can't wait to see what happens next. Raw, emotional, and heartwarming. Special no to James Roday, he was great in Psych, but really finds his stride in something with this much substance. He brings humor and warmth to the most dire of circumstances. This is the best new show on television."
175,"This is Adrama that hits the mark perfectly. Addresses many subjects with sensitivity and honesty that's not been seen for a while. Suicide adult depression, and other emotional conflicts. This show depicts them with realism and honesty that is most refreshing."
176,"Outstanding performances by all but the person who stands out the most....James Roday. I've watched James Roday through Psych...each and every episode many times over. Spite the character of Shawn Spencer being quite juvenile and extremely amusing....you can see the real James through this new character Gary Mendez; so self evident. Intensely disliked his post Psych horror movie which is a reflection of his persona; still presenting the immature....not wanting to grow up but spite this fraction of his whole, through Psych you can see his strong ability in being able to be serious...to present drama with much emotion and intensity. It can take you aback; a side you are not expecting to see. This production A Million Little Things, one could not have casted his character any better. He makes it his own; branded. Such maturity, emotion, realism to the unfolding drama presented with John committing suicide had brought me to tears many times. Well done James...well done. YOU have come into your own. You have crafted a more grounded, balanced and real presentation that is believable and provoking. Your acting chops are on fire. It is awesome in this production to see men presented showing their authentic emotional side with real 'feeling'. Bravo."
177,"This show has me addicted, cant get enough. So well written, Amazing cast, and such relatable story lines. After only 10 episodes they have touched on so many ""real life"" issues (suicide, infidelity, depression, parenthood, alcoholism, fighting cancer, beating cancer, pregnancy, sexuality, betrayal, family, friendship) and so much more, that anybody who watches can relate to one or more of these stories, and the chosen cast is perfect in each character. Love it, Keep it going"
178,The acting is wonderful! Can't wait for it to continue in January.
179,"I just started watching this show, been binge watching it ever since!! The cast, characters & storyline are amazing. If you like this is us, then you will LOVE this show definitely a must see tv show!!"
180,Interesting writing which invites us into the lives of the characters and encourages us to care ... something different from the formulaic dramas that are flooding the screen
181,This show might be a little dark but it is the most real show I have seen in a long time. I absolutely love the acting and I adore all of the characters and the way they intertwine with each other. It's the way things really are in this crazy world!!!
182,True to life drama. Love it so far. Makes me cry almost every episode but I can't wait to watch the next one.
183,Love the characters on this show! So relatable & loveable.
184,I really like the show so far but one character stands out and he's a terrible actor or maybe it's just his character. Gary is horrible!!
185,"I believe that this show could not come at a better time. It's been a little hard to watch the episodes fully, becsuse it csn be a tear drippet, but i always go back to finish it. But I got to give this a 10 thumbs up, and a fantastic job by producers and directors and of course all the characters are just great. The show covers a lot of things and it's so true to life, andvwhat its like today. I would recommend this show to anybody and everybody that I know. No spoilers for anyone all I can say is watch it from the beginning episode and then binge watch through the rest of the season wow that's all I can say."
186,"Real people, talking about real things. The cast and the writing are incredible and I truly hope people see what an incredible show this is."
187,"I started watching this show on a whim... and the characters drew me in. I have never seen depression so well depicted- not as a scary thing or something shameful, but something that is a personal battle. I don't want to ruin the show for anyone- so I will not go into all of the reasons why I love this show... but each friend shows such a raw and real aspect of life. Maggie is my favorite character- you will see why. Definitely give this show a chance."
188,"I was drawn in within the first 5-10 minutes of the pilot. I would venture to say anyone who watches to that point will be able to decide if this show is your style. My opinion has changed about some of the characters after watching several episodes though. I actually like it more! As I continue to learn some of the back stories, I can see why they probably are the way they are. I feel it's easy to become involved with each of them.As a person who deals with depression, I feel this shows gives us a voice, some insight to the internal dialogue we deal with. I would like to think that those who don't understand what it entails will learn a few things from watching. The character named Rome often has conversations stating what I feel but can't express, so that may be my draw to the show.Yes, there is occasional cheesy line, but I find it easy to look past it as the show progresses. For those comparing this to This Is Us, I personally disagree. That show just doesn't speak to me. With that being said, you can see I'm not one to follow the masses. I think it's worth investing 15 minutes to the pilot to decide for yourself if it's worthy of your time. I'm glad I did."
189,"Well Written, Great Cast, Fantastic, Had Me Hooked From The First Episode."
190,"Just started watching this TV show and WOW I'm hooked. its brilliant,"
191,"First, I have watched This Is Us from Day 1. I love the show and the storyline it carries. And, I will continue to watch it.As far as A Million Little Things, this by far has really piqued my interest. Those who think that depression shouldn't be openly discussed is part of what is wrong with people and families. Years ago, you never let anyone know and it was swept under the carpet. I think it brings about a true realization of what can happen to some people in their lives. We don't live in a bubble and it is time it is openly discussed on a TV show. It is long overdue. And who knows, it just might save a life."
192,"If you like this is us, you will love this one, really tugs at the heart strings, could not stop watching, well written and acted story line"
193,Please watch. Its not a tv show but also the real life as you feel you deeply live on the edge.
194,"Its refreshing to see a show that doesn't skip over issue or pretend like they don't happen. This show makes you fall in love with every character and on edge for what's going to happen next. And I mean come on, Gary is AMAZING"
195,I love this show and I think it hits home for so many people.
196,Only turned channels I'm hook lined sinked 3hour ago I. Still watching
197,"I love this show so much, it literally made me cry within the first ten minute. i love the plot ad the characters are cast so well and give it a comedic sense as well as being dark serious all at the same time. I cant wait to see where this goes because i could watch at least 5 seasons of this show."
198,"Only watched the first few episodes but This shows focus so far, is on men's mental health and bringing it into focus. Which I think is amazing . I look forward to watching the rest"
199,Love the story line and all the characters. Very relatable to our society currently!
