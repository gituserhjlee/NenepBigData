0,"I am a little biased here. I am in recovery. Sober for 20 years now. Everyday I am very grateful that I survived. I don't take my life for granted anymore. So when I herd about this show I had to watch. As soon as I was done was episode 1 I was the shows #1 fan.Now that the show has ended its fourth season I am happy to say ""I am still it's #1 fan"". I love the fact that the show takes many chances (Some chances work some don't). I love the fact that the people in recovery are shown as human and that they still make mistakes and ""life is still life"". The shows first season was a little ""hit and miss"". The producers were trying to figure out what was working and what wasn't. What was not working on the show was Christy's work life and dating life. Her friends (and mother) in recovery was comic gold. In season 2 they added Jaime Pressly, Mimi Kennedy & Beth Hall. When all these women are together in one scene is when the show shines its brightest. Again the show is not perfect but it least it takes more chances than most television shows. It is very funny and dare I say ""Very Real"". To everyone that works on the show I just want to say ""Bravo""."
1,"I love this series for lots of reasons, but does the Violet character have to be so ungrateful and disrespectful toward her Mom and Grandmother? I get it that she's been raised in a dysfunctional family, but who hasn't? I REALLY don't like the way she talks to her Mom. The script is SO funny and the actors' delivery of their lines is right on. I get why Allison Janney got an Emmy, but Anna Farris should have gotten one also!"
2,"Allison Janney made me do something I had never done before. To be devotedly attached to a sit-com. She has created a character in Mom that it's bloody irresistible. An awful mother that it's impossible not to love. That's only achievable if the actress playing her is a genius. Anna Faris playing her daughter is a total find for me. Wonderful and a perfect foil for Allison Janney who reminds me of some of my favorites from the past, Kay Kendall, Eve Arden, Mary Astor, Joyce Grenfell and at the same time, she's like nobody else. She had only one moment in Primary Colors but she's memorable and has an entrance in The Hours that took my breath away. I want to see her in a movie that showcases her extraordinary talents to the fullest. Is that too much to ask?"
3,"After 20 yrs of gambling I have become use to throwing away a dumb amount of cash to overcome emotional issues. The last episode got in my head and I am taking the steps to stop, right now. Today. This minute. Thank you for the much needed inspiration and the shout out! Love your show! It's smart and fun and inspiring."
4,"I LOVE this show. A 7 rating overall is far too low for this great show. First of all, the gorgeous Allison Janney is BRILLIANT as Bonnie. She really never fails to make me laugh. Her character is so lovably messed up. Secondly, this is one of my favorite role of Anna Farris's. I really like Anna Farris, but some of the roles she's done have missed the mark with me. In this show, I feel like Farris's acting style has really matured. She finds a good balance between the lovable, relatable lead and the goofball comic. Thirdly, the chemistry between the two of them is really where it's at. Their mother-daughter relationship is hilarious and charming. It's also very relatable, at least for those of us who maybe didn't have picture perfect childhoods or families. Fourthly, (yes, fourthly), the writing really is fantastic. The writers manage to address very real emotional issues with tenderness and wit. I really just can't praise it enough. This show genuinely is fantastic, and I hope they win lots more Emmys! They deserve it!"
5,"It's not just a comedy, it bears so much grief and pain as well as many great funny stories.It gives hope to anyone who have doubts about their life.Every episodes is well written. Especially the first episode. The 22nd episode is the most touching one!The cast is brilliant! Faris, Janny and Calveno are talented actresses. Even Rothenthal is funny and adorable.This is a one of a kind TV show for people who truly understand what life is about and brave enough to appreciate it everyday.Keep up the good work, Chuck!"
6,"Very good show!It is a shame to watch some negative ratings on such a series. Are people worried about teenage pregnancy, alcoholics, single moms or free sex? Well, get real, that is how real life is. The only thing I don't like, are the laugh tracks, but that is my problem.The way characters have been developing is incredible.It is very good to see that besides all the crap that may happen in our lives, it is always possible to correct ourselves. We can clearly see how Christy and Bonnie have a good and fair heart and always try to redeem themselves from mistakes (both of the past or present). Also, is lovely to see how their relationship develops, such as the relationships with their friends. They all may sound comically harsh to each others, but when something serious happens, we see them taking the right side and defending each other and that's what matters in life.I understand there are many types of humor, but to say MOM is not good because of their topics, makes no sense. Only one who lives in a shell or denies the real life can say that. It is much more interesting to see this than another clich√© storyline of some sort of normal family with a light tendency to be JUST funny. I personally congratulate both Anna Faris and Allison Janney. I was not a fan of them, but I am now. Besides their wonderful acting skills, they show a very humanistic mindset.AND TO THE HATERS, SEASON 5 IS COMING. BAM."
7,I have to say first off I have always loved Anna Farris from the scary movie series and she does not disappoint in this sitcom at all. All these people saying that this show is negative and trashy are the same people that love two and a half men and watch it faithfully. I have laughed through every episode so far and can't wait to see how the whole series turns out. The woman who plays Anna Farris's mom is so funny and it kind of reminds you of the mother on two and half men. Don't listen to what other people say and watch for yourself before you make a judgment call. I see other shows that have a good rating like we're the millers which has no laughs in it whatsoever. We live in a generation where people see one thing they don't like an all of sudden everything about the show is bad.
8,I stayed loyal to Last Man Standing thru 5 cast changes to the family until they replaced Molly Ephram as Mandy. I stayed loyal to Mom with 4 family members being written off the show. And now Christie is out. The premise is more of a spin-off with 5 damaged close-knit women talking about their problems at AA meetings then struggling single mom with kids trying to stay sober.
9,"I absolutely LOVE this show! The actors and actresses do a wonderful job at keeping you laughing! I admit, the first 2 episodes were slow on the laughs, but as the story progresses, it gets funnier and funnier. I recommend this show to anyone who loved Two and Half Men and love to laugh. Both Ana Faris and Allison Janney have great chemistry and it works for this show! They are easy to relate to. Being a single mom of a teen and a boy growing up, while working hard to pay the bills and turn around your life whilst having a crazy mom in the mix! The actors who play the teen and kid also do a great job. All in all the whole show is good. You have cameos that come in. Who doesn't miss French Stewart? He is in this show and he makes for even more laughs! All in all, this show is great and if you are looking for some laughs and see the awesome chemistry with everyone on this show, then this is the one for you!"
10,"It's not easy to make a story of a dysfunctional family truly funny without making the characters dumb and ""over-the-top,"" but this show not only succeeds, it has gone through two seasons so far without losing any of its quality. It's a bit racy in spots but never gets crude (like 2-1/2 Men) or cheerfully dumb (Big Bang Theory and most other sitcoms), but even mixes in some pathos without affecting the basic humor. I haven't seen that ability since ""Frasier"". The cast, led by Anna Faris and Allison Janney, is uniformly excellent, with only French Stewart's chef being a bit too much of a caricature. Here's hoping the coming third season continues its excellent beginning."
11,"I absolutely love this show but Violet just brings it down! She's such a downer it drives me crazy!! That aside, this show rocks!!"
12,"I get very angry when people call this trashy. These people are normal! They are not living in a trailer selling meth! The show also does not glorify ""Teen Pregnancy"". If you watch the show the mother knows she made mistakes. I love the fact she loved her daughter even more when her daughter needed her the most. She did not make her daughter feel shame! She did not like the fact her daughter was pregnant but she knows there is nothing she can do about it! The teen made a mistake. Her mother still loves her and that is an AWESOME MESSAGE. This is after all not the 1950's. As a person in AA I find the AA aspect of the show very funny. The cast is able to bring out the best in the material.Since this is a first year show the producers are still figuring out the voice of the show. Now there is 3 aspects if the show. Christy (the main character)1)Her home life/relationship with her mother. She also happens to have a pregnant teen. Not to mention her dating life.2) Her work life (She once dated her married boss) 3) AA LifeNow I suggest to the producers they focus on Christy and her relationship with her mother. Also there is plenty of millage they can get out of AA and the Marjorie character (An AA MEMBER)The work life seems forced and its usually the weakest in the laugh department.... Just saying"
13,"OK so it's not what you want you children to model themselves after but then neither was producer Chuck Lorre's Two and a Half Men. This is sort of the female version of that great show and maybe it's because it's a mostly female cast that it seems to raise the ire of so many. I don't know or care, to me its funny. Anna Faris is well¬Ö Anna Faris and if you like her in things like the ""Scary Movie"" series then you will probably like her playing Christy who often innocently deadpans her way through raunchy or absurd situations with great comedic sensibility. Allison Janney plays Christy's Mom Bonnie who is the counterpart to Charley Harper's slutty mom Evelyn. The show probably could use a ""Berta"" but it has enough good characters to develop into the same sort of comedic juggernaut Two and a Half Men was, given some good writing. Time will tell."
14,"Now that Anna Faris is no longer in it, it went from a 10 star show to a 5 star show. Still has its moments, but it's just not the same. Come back Anna Faris.....pleeeeease!"
15,"Oh my god this show has me laughing in so many ways. people talk bad about the first episode. It is like any show and you are just getting to know the characters. The content is a serious matter and is brought to light in a most hilarious way. After that it takes off like fire. Fantastic writing, clever funny lines and a great connection. I love the characters. I hardly ever laugh out loud while watching TV. I have had plenty of truly great laughs. People shouldn't be judging a show because they don't the matter of talking about teenage pregnancy, or alcoholism. Its great to see these topics discussed in a open way. A funny one. But at the same time these topics are taken seriously."
16,"""Mom"" is a refreshing, in-your-face comedy with so many laughs you don't get much chance to settle down. For many people it will be too crude, but for those who don't mind the raunchier side of TV, this one is just fine (and never as crude as ""Two and a Half Man"" has become). Multiple Emmy winner (""West Wing"") Alison Janney plays the mom to cute as a button Anna Faris (""Scary Movie"") who in turn is the mom to relative newcomer Sadie Calvano. They all share problems with addiction and sexual appetites which make for lots of jokes as well as some touching emotional moments. Rounding out the cast is a riotous French Stewart (""3rd Rock"") as a chef, Nathan Corddry (""Harry's Law"") as a philandering restaurant manager, and Matt Jones (""Breaking Bad"") as Faris' out of work ex.The creators include Eddie Gorodetsky and Chuck Lorre who gave us, among other things, ""The Big Bang Theory"" and ""Two and a Half Men""It's too early to tell if they can keep up the momentum, but the first episode certainly earns them a second look from me."
17,"I was intrigued by the idea of a comedy show that portrays the horrors of addiction and its inevitable tragedies. As a long term survivor of the disease of alcoholism and an active participant in recovery, I began watching it to see how the show presented itself as relates to recovery. I have to say, after having watched all of the episodes so far that I find both the unfolding stories of the characters and the little slices of life at AA to be very well done. For those who say that the show is exploitative of human tragedy, I invite you to work hard, become a drug addict or alcoholic and come to a recovery program to see just how close to reality this show really is. In my time in recovery I have seen countless situations that were just as ridiculous and tragic as this one turn around and become stories of human triumph over adversity. One of the great joys of recovery is to be able to look back at the crazy things that happened in our lives and laugh because they are long gone and have been replaced by sanity. In my experience, early sobriety is often just as crazy as is presented here. I have never had anyone pull up to my house drunk in a fire truck as happened in the latest episode, but I have to say, if it did occur, I wouldn't be very surprised. Drunks are an imaginative lot and prone to bad decisions. People under the influence, both of substances and of substance abusers can do some very stupid things If you can't relate to the humor in this show, I understand. I probably couldn't either if I hadn't seen it played out over and over for years. Far too often, it ends tragically, but the joy that comes when it ends in triumph is wonderfully fulfilling. I have been so fortunate to have seen a good number of people come through things at least as crazy as this show and lead great lives, and then be able to look back and laugh at the folly that was their life under the yoke of addiction. I can't wait to see what happens to Christy and her mom! 9 Stars."
18,"I honestly started watching this show because I am a huge fan of Anna Faris, I have loved her in everything she's been in! She is hilarious and absolutely one of my favorite actresses. That being said, I actually wasn't expecting to like this show at all, but boy was I wrong! I'm hooked! I think it's hilarious! Anna and Alison, who plays her mother, absolutely shine together! Alison is a phenomenal actresses, I love how she says what's on her mind! Yes, sometimes I can see how some comments on the show could be offensive... but isn't every show like that!? Life is like that! You're not going to like everything. I think it's unfair to say this is a terrible show unless you go in open-minded & really give it a shot! It's a winner in my book!!!"
19,"This has always been a good, decent show. The later seasons are starting to wear thin on inventive, credible stories, but that's a fact for nearly any sitcom. If it has gone wrong in any way of late it was the addition of Kristen Johnston. Her character is an overblown, unnecessary bore. Lop her off and bring the kids back instead."
20,"As a recovering addict myself, I love how they depict the recovery process so accurately. Many shows depict recovery poorly and I was concerned Mom would be that way. I was a fan from the first episode. It helps people understand how important recovery groups are to addicts. The characters are awesome and on-screen chemistry is amazing."
21,"Mom depicts with humor a real-life single mother trying to survive in this 21st century social climate. The characters are believable and the situations are real. I found myself laughing out loud any number of times during the show. Anna Faris does a fine job of depicting Christy,a single-mom recovering from an addiction problem with two kids from different guys. Christy's mom Bonnie (Alison Janney) does and excellent job of portraying the typical 2013 cougar who lives for her own self-gratification and seem perfectly fine with having been a terrible mother. I hope with all sincerity that Mom gets picked-up by the network. Good luck Mom!"
22,"I do not really understand how people do not appreciate this show. They are completely missing out on the plot. It talks about real life problems with some humour. It does not advocates any kind of lifestyle but just how people deal with those problems. There are not a lot of shows that talk about those topics and it is done really well. The acting is really good compared to other shows out there, it's better than two and a half man. I could not stop laughing during the E and hearty breakfast and the zombies and Cobb Salad made me laugh but it was touching at the same time. I would recommend watching at least 6-7 episodes, you will understand the characters better."
23,I don't understand how this show has made it for so many seasons. The only saving grace is Allison Jannette and I'm really curious if she lost a bet or is being blackmailed she into doing this show. I used to like Anna Faris but her character is so horrible I've begun disliking the actress herself. Every single episode is Christy whining about what a horrible mother Bonnie is and how everything is her fault. Christy never takes responsibility for her own actions and isn't that great of a mother herself. Supporting cast (except for her kids and moronic ex-husband) aren't too bad and as I said Janney is always great. The only show worse than this is 2 Broke Girls.
24,"Once in while, it is good to be reminded that we live in a male centric society. The drinking and womanizing of Charlie Harper was quite acceptable and cute. But try to make a comedy about the realities of life for the women who have been dumped by the Charlie Harpers of this world and you get comments about the values this sitcom is carrying. Isn't that a little hypocritical at best, and plainly sexist at worst? I simply love Anna Faris (I hope she reads this) This lady is talented and able to carry this show with the fabulous Allison Janey. ""Mom"" is certainly not perfect, but it has the unique quality of portraying something true. It is honest and doesn't try to be anything else. It is refreshing, and in my opinion, deserve an 8."
25,"What a laugh track says to me is this: it says you don't trust your own writing, actors, or show. It says you think I am stupid and wouldn't know where to laugh. It weakens your effort.The show is fine. The acting is good, and I really enjoy seeing middle aged people in a show. I am not a great fan of family sitcoms, but this one is much better than most. I enjoyed the 12-step background.But I cannot forgive a laugh track. When did MASH give up its laugh track? 1984? That is getting to be quite sometime ago. So TV, quit doing it. It tells me that your show is aimed at far stupider people than me. If it isn't, then trust your writers and actors."
26,"This show is very much like a Norman Lear show of the '70s and I don't mean that an insult.It's a show that is not afraid to have cutting issues, while still remain funny. Unlike many shows on today, the characters face consequences that do not reset in the next episode.Our country currently has a drug problem, so I am glad that they don't sugar-coat the characters and give them just a drinking addiction, which has been done over and over again.Anna Faris is also very funny and talented. She can make you laugh with just a look."
27,I love that show so much and I especially love Adam and it it has been wonderful to watch their romance. I went back and watched all of the old episodes to get cut up but I find myself very disappointed in the current season which focuses on the women in the 12 step program and never mentions the two children a son and a daughter which is ironic that even on Mother's Day the two children of the primary character or never mentioned they been written off the show as if they never existed and for this reason I no longer watch I found just focusing on the 12 step characters very boring
28,"I love shows that tell it like it is. Shows that don't sugarcoat awful situations, and that do it with unique style. This show pushes the envelope in family dysfunction. It's two steps further into the abyss than The Simpsons or Married With Children.As much as people don't want to admit, we do turn out like our parents. Unfortunately this is a family of alcoholic, drug addict, sluts. Christy's (Faris)daughter Violet is keeping the family tradition alive by getting pregnant while still in high school. Christy who is trying to survive and stay sober has strained relationships with both Violet and her own mother Bonnie (Janney). Christy is a punching bag for both. The one-liners keep coming episode to episode, with punches so hard that you want to give Christy a drink and tell her to forget them. But, Christy can give as good as she takes. While not mean spirited, she's told Violet that having her ruined her life. It's hard to fathom, but hilarious to hear.This is a show that's not for the delicate or faint of heart. It's raw on every level. There's adultery, sexual harassment, terrible parenting, teen pregnancy, and just about anything else that not's suitable for immature audiences. But, if you watch it for entertainment value and not for life lessons you'll be hooked at how hilarious this show is. Sometimes you're laughing so hard you miss a joke or two.Great performances by all. Janney is a true stand out, she's nuts and spot on in her delivery and actions.I hope this show makes it a few seasons, it's worth it."
29,"I've loved Anna Faris since the first time i saw her in the Scary Movie franchise. She's one of the most hilarious actress, she makes those faces you cannot not laugh at. I've discovered Allison Janney in Juno and thought she was just amazing! And the chemistry of them together is really great! The jokes are well placed through the episodes, they deal with important subject and are able to treat them with comedy and tact and that is a great quality. The grand-mother/mother/daughter relationship is fantastic! The kid actors and also pretty funny. It might be a useless detail but the thing that bothered me were the ""In the last episode of Mom"": where they spent one entire minute remembering us what we never forgot from last week episode, it feels like a waste of time. Also, as much as i love Anna Faris, we can feel some stress and/or nervosity in her act, it might be because she's not use to the audience or something, but its like there is a little something missing to make it more real, i don't know what though. But she is a great actress and can deal with awkward physical comedy so well.To sum up, great cast, good jokes, gorgeous sets and a beautiful chemistry between the main actress! 9/10"
30,"Don't know where I've been all these years. Never heard/watched this show until reruns in 2019. Don't even know what network the show is on -- obviously, I don't watch that channel. Absolutely love these crazy, drama nuts. I love how they drop little snippets of outrageous, disfunctional, things that have taken place in their lives. We laugh -- with a tear every now and then -- through the whole show."
31,"I am almost without words how genius this show is.
First, the cast is incredible. Without Allison it's unimaginable, that's for sure cause she's a straight up genius, but the rest of the cast is pretty incredible too.
Second, It's everything. Inspiring, moving, loving, heartbreaking, women empowering, romantic, shocking, sad, happy and incredibly funny. It's a freaking life! You can find a little of yourself in almost every situation and also see how to do it right next time or at least how to try and do your best in life..
Third, I just can't get over how incredibly amazing Allison (Bonnie) is. I don't know if this is maybe close to what she's like in real life but I am totally feeling her Bonnie character. I truly adore that woman!I'm from Europe and we are all staying at home in my country (3 weeks now), due to virus epidemic, and while searching what to watch to keep my mind a little happier I stumbled upon this show. I've been binge watching it ever since and it saved me..I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! üëå"
32,I think a Justin Long reunion would be interesting. I liked their chemistry in season 1.
33,"I love Anna Faris! There, I said it. She is like the Juhi Chawla of Hollywood. Or Juhi Chawala could be the Anna Faris of Bollywood. Either way, I don't understand why this show only has a 7 out of 10 rating on IMDb. It's one of the funniest series I've ever seen. The writers are amazing and there is fresh new stuff in every episode. Sadie Calvano is beautiful, Blake Garrett is cute and the comedy timing between Anna Faris and Allison Janney is impeccable. Haters - Please have an open mind! One of the most hilarious shows on TV currently. I hope this series gets more seasons and we look forward to new characters like Kevin Pollak."
34,"I don't get what's supposed to be funny about three generations of women making poor life choices. Promiscuity, teenage pregnancy, alcoholism, drug addiction, drug dealing, deadbeat parents, all-around awful behaviour are hardly comedy material and surely aren't laughing matter if taken as lightly and superficially as the show does.Frankly there's nothing heartwarming or redeeming about those people... You'd just want to grab them by the neck and shake some sense into them.Dysfunctionality can be sort of funny (think of all the ""zany family"" shows, often far from masterpieces, but still watchable), white trash can have its moments, if the wackiness is up eleven (eg. My name is Earl). Even a rather average show like Two Broke Girls manages to handle it better, despite very over-the-top juvenile humour, because the characters are somewhat sympathetic and their struggle becomes endearing.""Mom"", on the other hand, is just a gallery of maladjusted women who still feel some sort of pride about their mistakes and, despite the attempts to portrait it as wrong, don't seem so determined to change.Because apparently ruining your own life has great comedy value!"
35,"We really wanted to like this. Well-known and well-like actors, good reviews, etc. Started cringing from the first scene. Topics were simply too serious to be funny. Multi-generational sluts, teen pregnancies, adultery, drug and alcohol use, drug sales, (at least they threw in AA), absent and deadbeat dads..... Hey I can watch the news for this plot. About half way through we voted to delete the scheduled recordings. I'm trying to think back to see if I actually laughed during the show. No, I don't remember doing so. We did keep pointing out the various actors and what shows we knew them from. So sad that there is so much comic talent here going to waste."
36,"This show isn't credible. Bonnie and Christy have low paying jobs but they eat every day with their Alcoholics Anonymous cronies in a Napa bistro. I know the Bay Area well and those everyday snacks at the bistro would be beyond their income level in pricey northern California.I find only Marjorie's and Wendy's characters to be likable. Bonnie is a chronic liar and lacks empathy for the problems of others. Christy makes no sense. She won't sleep with an honorable, outdoorsy engineer but she'll go to bed with a drunken, stoned fireman whom she's known for less than an hour. Jill is a just a rich, narcissistic bimbo who rubs Bonnie and Christy's poverty in their nose.The theme of the show is substance abuse and recovery yet it takes a back seat to the personality disorders of Bonnie and Christy which is allegedly where the comedy lies. I also resent the way Bonnie and Christy complain about men when men are constantly bailing them out ... Adam bailing them out of jail, Baxter buying Christy a car, etc.. There's something just so phony about this show."
37,"The main actress is a great female comedian. In all her works so far, she never needed a laughter track to make us laugh. But for this show, she needed it.The story-lines are so, so, so depressing. Teenage pregnancy, selling and taking drugs, adultery, underage sex, not paying child support, beating a hooker to death, living in a van, taking a child to a strip club, cutting of your finger. And this was all in the first episode! Without the laughter track, you would think you were watching a deadly serious HBO Drama. There are no puns, no jokes, no one-liners. Its depressing watching the worst society has to offer and a laughter track making us think that its okay to laugh at a wasted life.Cancel this show. Please. Just cancel it."
38,"At first when I saw the name of Chuck Lorre as the producer I was genuinely happy because I really loved his former works, i.e. Chuck and Two and a half men (Up to Season 5 of course). However, this show is just plain dull and inappropriate; and when I say inappropriate I do not mean in a hilarious way that it just makes you long for the next episode but more like makes you wanna tear your skull wide open, take your brain out and apologize to it because you made it watch a whole episode of this show. After watching the first episode of ""Mom"", I convinced myself to give it another try and watch another episode and see what goes. It just gets even worse with making the teenage daughter pregnant as well. It's like teen pregnancy runs in their genes. I know these are desperate times given that many of our comedy sitcoms are reaching their ends, but believe me ""Mom"" is not the fix !"
39,"No, no, no. I laughed once & only because I share the main character's name & she pronounced it funny. So many actors that I enjoy, it's a shame that their talents are wasted on this drivel. The comedy is forced. This show is trying to sell comedy on situations that aren't comedic. This is a show about at least 2 generations of alcoholic, drug addicted, promiscuous mothers with zero parenting skills & the possible breeding of a third generation to turn out the same way. I found myself frustrated & irritated while watching this show. She comes from work to find a boy sneaking out of her daughter's window, then learns from her young son that her daughter & that boy took a shower together. Her response was a sarcastic ""awesome"" & then proceeds to do NOTHING about it. From then on it was nothing but downhill. Absolutely appalling. I just don't think I see this lasting. At least it's not lasting for me cause I'm not watching anything more from this show."
40,"When I attempted to watch the first episode of this show I knew nothing about it, other than it starred Allison Janney (who I love) and Anna Faris (who I sometimes like, more often tolerate).I made it about 1 minute in when I had to stop and look on IMDb to see if anyone could tell me if the canned laughter was going to keep going, or if it was some kind of joke. There is a constant barrage of it. As I read the reviews, I saw that it was the devil work of that doofus who made Two and a Half Men, and everything became clear. I can only assume that Janney and Farris have fallen on hard times, because this is mindless, unfunny and fingers-down-a-chalkboard irritating. For me, utterly unwatchable."
41,"Really? You really had a sappy, totally unrealistic stupid show glorifying teenage pregnancy, with the Mom and grandmother happily supporting this moronic situation? Don't you understand how much damage you did, and that now some stupid, immature teenage girls who already are playing with this fantasy with their equally stupid boyfriends just got another green light to delude themselves into believing, ""Aww, how cute I'll be pregnant and my boyfriend will be all happy and supportive, as will my mom, and we'll just trip on down the road of life and live happily ever after..""blah blah blah! I kept waiting and hoping that the pregnancy test would be negative and that the girl would get a wake up call to at least use birth control. But no...not a word about that. What a terrible disservice you did to teenage girls! The only HONEST show about teen pregnancy is ""Teen Mom"", which shows the reality of boyfriends who bail, girls who have to give up everything for that baby they had so much fun making, the mothers of the teen moms who are usually single as well having to step in and give up their own lives because of the selfish decisions their daughters made, the poverty and struggles, abuse by the boyfriends, constant stress, depression and misery, lack of education so bettering themselves is next to impossible....That's the reality! Not this moronic garbage in this particular Mom episode! Honestly, shame on you for such a stupid, thoughtless episode!"
42,"Several of my friends recommended this show to me after the first season, so I decided to check it out. One episode was more than enough. I am a reasonably responsible adult who goes to work every day, and am a landlord on the side. So I find absolutely nothing funny in a show about an irresponsible single mom and her equally irresponsible mother who gamble away three months of rent, skip out on the landlord, then try and make the audience sympathetic to their ""plight"". Revolting.I can only imagine what further deplorable depths they will plumb try to get cheap laughs. And speaking of laughs: I thought canned laughter went out with the 90s.If you really want to watch a comedy about truly wretched individuals, go watch a show where they make no pretense of sympathetic characters (and no stupid laugh track): It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Now that's funny!"
43,"Spoiler: Don't waste your time, boring, unfunny, sad.I watched this show when I needed background noise while working. White noise would have been funnier. Which is a shame, because: Ana Farris is funny. Allison Janney is even funnier. Anything with French Stewart in it can't be all that bad. And yet, this is incredibly bad, unfunny. Which is really a shame, as all these fine performers deserve so much more than non-existing comedy with non-existing punch lines, the most artificial laugh track this side of Big Bang/Two & Half Men/etc. Every once in a while, there's a glimmer of hope where a somewhat risqu√© or nasty line comes out and you think this might go in a direction which could be interesting, and then they chicken out and go the middle, humdrum, path. Just sad."
44,I love this show!!! I can't understand why more people aren't talking about this show! With the worst crisis going on in North America it should be as popular as This Is US!!! And it's funny!
45,"I have really enjoyed this show, particularly since it found its footing (around season 2). I'm a huge Allison Janney fan and I find her to be hilarious in this. I was never a big fan of Faris, but I admit she's grown on me with this role and I think she and Allison play really well off of each other.They have always done a great job with casting - Mimi Kennedy, Octavia Spencer (who was hilarious here!), Jaimie Pressley, William Fichtner, and Kevin Pollak all fit in perfectly and have/had great chemistry with each other. Some really funny guest stars too, including Rosie O'Donnell whom I absolutely loathe otherwise.I don't know whose idea it was to bring in the Tammy character but they should be fired immediately. Kristen Johnson plays this character the same way she's played every other character - loud, obnoxious, and completely unfunny. Her comedy has all the nuances of explosive diarrhea. The only time I've ever laughed at her was when she fell out the window on Sex and the City. The Tammy character doesn't add to the show nor does Johnson's brand of comedy fit in with the others.I hope she's not permanent, I'd rather see the camera time given to any of the other actors on this show."
46,"Talk about jumping on some trendy, white trash bandwagon. I agree with the last reviewer- they lost me with the pregnancy show. How much worse could this be for our daughters to watch? Heartwarming? Three generations of disrespect, careless, self abuse... with no direction for their lives. Oh yea, that's comedy. The thing that I love best about The Big Bang Theory is that it doesn't rely on cheap shock or trendy, low life laughs. This one is just the opposite. Very disappointing. TV clearly influences our country and our kids. It's sad when Hollywood just doesn't care. It's even worse when parents don't. Do us all a favor and turn the channel."
47,"I would like to start by saying I hate pretty much anything Chuck Lorre has his grubby little paws in, but this show has taken it to a new level of bad. Quite literally every show Chuck Lorre ""creates"" is exactly the same but in a slightly different setting, the jokes are literally the same just twisted to suit the premise. The canned laughter, the crappy script, poor acting and general theme make this one of the worst shows I've ever seen. Anna Faris being the only shinning light in the 22 minute horror show that is Mom, how they even persuaded her into this is beyond me. I don't usually write reviews but I felt compelled after Mom. I truly hope you heed my advice and steer very well clear of this nightmare."
48,"The most painful 15 minute or so of TV I've sat through.Love Anna Farris and Allison Janney. I don't know how they got them to be in this. It touches on serious issues the the worst possible way. The canned laughter at every line really grates. There is nothing good I have to say about this, I normal don't write reviews, it was just so bad I felt compelled to.So, To finish the 10 lines.Terrible.Do not watch unless you want to watch something that's diabolical (some people obviously do, hence its existence. Please say that's 10 lines because I don't want to write any more.Ta."
49,"If you can get past the forced ""laugh track"" and the pathetic attempt at cathartic acting, you're left with nothing more than a show about a rehabbing mom who has issues with her mom and extremely bad acting. At first, the laugh track was annoying. But after the fifteenth laugh in three minutes, I realized that even the producers realized that this was such a bad show that it needed whatever help it could get to garner viewer support. On a lighter note, props to Badger from Breaking Bad landing a role that will not last nearly as long as his Star Trek dream. How this show ever got a pilot and how we as viewers ever got subjected to this, I can only blame CBS. Yes, Charlie Sheen went of the rails on the Crazy Train, but CBS has officially jumped the shark when it comes to comedies. Tsk, tsk CBS. I give this show one more week before it's yanked and we are spared anymore of the horror that is MOM"
50,"With such a good cast you would expect a much better show that was actually entertaining!! I don't know how the writers could think this is funny! I have seen the first 2 episodes and although I don't expect miracles, I didn't laugh once but did cringe a lot! The storyline is disgusting and rather depressing! The main character was bought up by a dysfunctional alcoholic mother and is a recovering alcoholic herself with a pregnant teenage daughter! Honestly, if you want to watch a depressing show, this is ideal! I do not believe the good reviews for a second! I know people have varying tastes in humor but I watched this show with several people and Nobody laughed!! I hope the writers change the type of so called humor to actual humor! Its not funny to watch a show where a mother is such a depressing character with no funny lines!!1 star is too many!!"
51,"It has potential - I have to give it a few more episodes before I decide too keep it on my watch list. I like Anna Farris, but not sure if I like her character. There is a good storyline and it has room to 'grow'. I wasn't sure about Two Broke Girls either and now it's one of my favorite shows! Chuck Lorre Shows are hit or miss for me. I love the Big Bang Theory - but HATE Two and a Half Men, so we shall see. Hopefully this show will get enough following to have time to develop a stable story line. But chances are, this may be a show that doesn't last long unless the next 3 or 4 shows pick up a bit. I don't recall really laughing, like REALLY laughing during the entire pilot. :-/And the little boy casted for Christy's son doesn't look like he fits in the family - seeing his ""dad' made some sense, but he doesn't seem to fit. Just my opinion."
52,"Love the show, BUT, if the script is for Allison Janney's to be ever more annoying with her ever more narcissistic behavior I'm out as a Fan. Her character is so freaking annoying and it gets worse as the seasons progress. One would think one would improve being in therapy for so long. Every other character has seemed to grow emotionally, spiritually etc. Janney's character is slipping backwards. Shame. I used to like this show."
53,"I've added a few upcoming programmes to my 'watch-list' over the past few months.'Mom' I first became aware of after the absence of Anna Faris from our screens since I had seen 'What's your number' The premise sounded promising and it was exciting to hear of Anna to star in a televised sitcom that could air once a week.The plot-line to the show puts Kristy (Anna Faris) at crossroad situation where she has recently become sober from alcohol and is now dealing with building a stronger relationship with her children (Blake Garrett Rosenthal and Sadie Calvano) and struggling to forgive her mother (Allison Janney) for the past. Kristy also has leaned on her boss (Nathan Corddry) for comfort during this time. The emotional comedic aspect that the pilot showcases is definitely refreshing. I enjoyed this element of the episode so much that I even considered the possibility of it taken on a serious dramatic turn within later episodes that could be enjoyable and unique.I have noted both some positives and negatives (aspects to work on) from Episode one: . Cast. Great casting of the three generation of women in the show ;Anna Faris, Allison Janney, Sadie Calvano. Great chemistry between all three actors who appear to genuinely enjoy the role.. Mom- moments. There are some genuine funny and emotional moments that are scattered throughout the episode without overloading on either. The balance is fair between the two elements and there is even some laugh out moments such as scenes between Kristy and Bonnie discussing their past history.. The pilot was structured like a ladder as that it was told step by step without overloading the viewer with too much information. There lies a strong continuance factor to develop further story lines to continue a strong season with the hope of a renewal.Negatives from episode one: . The odd unfunny Mom moments. The Opening scene of Kristy on shift in the restaurant where she appears emotional and at breaking point wasn't that funny. Although I did enjoy the emotional side of this character the scene really let the introduction of the episode down.. Kristy's love interest simply does not entertain me. Perhaps its the casting of Nathan Corddry. The overused plot-line of 'sleeping with your boss/someone who is married' has been used twice already in this episode.I am looking forward to seeing where the series goes in terms of comedy and emotional paths. The secret to success here is the cast, If the cast and the writers are utilized to the maximum success will follow throughout the rest of the season."
54,"I honestly think the people leaving negative reviews about this show really just don't understand the direction of the show. While this show demonstrates taboo topics such as teen pregnancy, it is by no means demonstrating it in a way that says ""Hey girls, you should totally have a baby when you're a teenager because it will make your life all roses and good times for all of eternity!"" This show is about a single mom who has admittedly made one bad decision after the next, and is now trying to piece it together in her mid 30's while dealing with a teenager, a younger child and his dead beat drug addict father, while battling her own struggles of alcohol and the never-ending life of living paycheck to paycheck. This girl has made so many bad decisions, that she has become accustomed to things in life never going her way, so she is able to laugh at the constant roadblocks and mishaps that occur. I think this is refreshing and a really great combat to the shows out there that do actually glorify teen pregnancy such as Teen Mom and 16 & Pregnant. So even if you were never a teenage mother, everyone has made mistakes that affected them for the rest of their lives, and that's why I feel this show is relatable. Everyone reaches the point where they think things can't get worse, then they do, and all you can do is laugh. That's what this show is about, and I think it's good."
55,I thought this show was about a single mom? The main character isn't a mother. Her kids are never around.
56,"I have got to say that it is sooo cool to see a show that is able to make recovery comical and also bring a heartwarming side into it. Having been in recovery for 18 months i have had the time of my life, but i know that is not the case for everyone else who is in recovery. I pray and hope that other people who are in recovery can find some humor and serenity from Mom like I do. I am so grateful that this show is on the air to let everyone see that people who are in recovery can stay sober by working together and that it can really be a struggle and that it is not just about not drinking or using. I also hope that if a struggling addict or alcoholic sees the show that they may consider going to a meeting. Thank you to the cast and creators you probably are not fully aware of the impact your making üëçüòé."
57,This show is actually very funny. It has the perfect amount of vulgarity and crudeness mixed in with a dose of realness.Anna Faris & Allison Janney are dynamic together and were truly fantastic casting choices. They are both perfectly suited to television and carry the show impressively. Luckily they also have fantastic material to work with which showcases their talents well.Mom is a great show to watch after a long day at work. It really helps you appreciate your life and bonus makes you laugh you a** off. A truly good show that has the potential to keep getting better and hopefully has enough staying power to remain on air for at least a few more seasons.
58,"I like to watch TV series and movies. I want to be entertained and yet challenged. Mom as a TV series does not tread on new ground. It is an easy to watch series. However, unlike other comedies these days it actually tries to say something. 2.5 men, and Big Bang are all series that amuse but they just don't try to tread a bit deeper in the thought. Big Bang is actually one of the biggest disappointments in that it stays as superficial as ever.Mom reminds of Rosanne, which back in its day was one of my favourite comedy series. It was very effective and entertaining because it did not just try to do comedy. Rosanne had its serious moments where it tried to answer common day problems in a realistic manner. Rosanne did not shy away from domestic abuse, gay and lesbian issues, nor violence or teenage social problems. Thus I say Thank-You to Mom because I finally have a Rosanne worthy follow series..."
59,"This new sit com about 3 generations of women is good. Both the stars Anna Faris and Alison Janney are excellent actresses with great comedic timing and delivery. Anna is the likable type of comedienne it's okay to tune into weekly. It's great to see Alison doing comedy she is so versatile. At first I thought she would be too smart looking for the role but she is great. The dialog is sharp and original and well written. Manages to give a funny treatment of teen pregnancy, alcoholism and other white trash issues. Usually it takes some time to warm up to a sit com but his one is funny from the start. It's got a humor that is grown up enough like King of Queens later seasons. Good use of A list guest stars like Justin Long and Octavia Spencer. Well done again Chuck Lorre."
60,"Although this show has some funny moments here and there, it should not be promoted as a sitcom. The show revolves around recovering addicts in a disfunctional family and is more depressing than funny. Should be billed as a drama."
61,"This show is a laugh a minute, and not many shows are like that. Hope it runs for many seasons to come. These two ladies are the tops at comedy and have me in stitches every week. They make a great mother and daughter team and cover some good real life issues, while making you smile at the same time. They have good and bad times as single mothers struggling to survive alcoholism and yet there are always laughs to lighten the mood and make for a very enjoyable show, i do not know how anyone could say this was not an excellent show. Well done am looking forward to many more seasons."
62,"Another example of the dumbing down of America perpetrated by these so called artists and TV intellectuals.This show is horrid, awful and disgusting.It is not about a dysfunctional family (which can be funny), it is about junk, garbage people, their miserable lives and lowbrow toilet humor.I was horrified to know that there are people that think it is funny to be an alcoholic, a pregnant teenager, a promiscuous mother/grandmother, to talk about things that should be private openly etc, etc, etc.I was extremely embarrassed to watch this show in the company of my wife.What are those guys thinking? Don't they know the meaning of ""funny"" ""entertainment"", ""intelligence"".This is a show made by baboons for baboons, this is the only explanation."
63,"Typical American sitcom, without the slightest trace of subtlety. It's as if they believe that 99% of viewers are so dumb that unless the joke hits you in the face you won't understand it. Well, I understood it all but the attempted forced humor just isn't funny. Such a shame as I love Anna Faris. But any family with as many flaws and faults as this one would in reality be without redemption and certainly not worthy of empathy. Alcoholism, drug addiction, debauchery, rudeness, unwanted pregnancies, lack of discipline. Yes, this is a family that you'd really want living next to you. Ijust find nothing funny about a family of pathetic, self-absorbed lowlifes ""trying to find their way"". Being a fan of Big Bang I expected better from this, being another Chuck Lorre creation, but where most of the BBT cast are likable and the humor is well rounded, this one just misses the target completely."
64,"I started watching the show because of the remarkable Allison Janney and was shocked when I fell in love with the whole cast! Anna Faris has amazing comedic timing with some of the funniest facial expressions I've ever seen; Allison Janney brings balances the comedic and dramatic aspects of the show perfectly and that physical comedy, a round of applause please; Sadie Calvano has blown me away considering her age, her acting in the season finale left me speechless! The storyline gripped me immediately and did not disappoint as the show went on.A huge shout out also to Spencer Daniels, Octavia Spencer, Mimi Kennedy, French Stewart, Matt Jones and Chuck Lorre. 10 out of 10, I highly recommend!"
65,This show is hilarious. The cast is perfect. I love how they touch on real life issues. This show will always be a favorite just like Friends & Big Bang Theory.
66,"I believe that a 7 rating for this brilliant show is far too low. There have been comedy shows (unlike Mom) which gradually lost their comedic side and merely counted on people's emotional bonds with the characters throughout the years in order to maintain their audience, so at one point, they even stopped trying to write any witty or funny material for these shows. Meanwhile, every scene of Mom is incredibly well-written; both funny or emotional ones. I believe this show is what the world needs today. A breath of fresh air filled with laughter, hope, optimism, kindness and caring for family and friendship bonds."
67,"Allison Janney got a new fan after this show. She is so hilarious and relatable even when she's the ""bad guy"". Her character, Bonnie, got me hooked on this show. However, I love all the characters and think the actors have great chemistry. I wish this show was more popular so it would go on forever. It's definitely an underrated gem!"
68,"I love everything about this show. The leads are wonderful, the message is great and I find myself laughing and crying all the time. Love a comedy that knows when to be serious"
69,"I did not know what to expect before watching this show. I really like Anna Faris, and Chuck Lorre's ""Two and Half Men"" was by far (before Ashton K) one of the funniest TV- shows. But I have to say there hasn't been a single episode that has disappointed me so far and I've seen all of the episodes that have aired. If you loved Arrested Development, I think you're going to love this too. I'm just saying, if you, too, come from a dysfunctional family then you're going to be able to relate to Mom on a whole other level than people coming from ""normal"" families. The show contains a lot of irony, dark humour and witty comments.Please do not ever stop producing this show! I will pay all of the production costs myself if it comes down to that. Yours truly, biggest fan"
70,"Mom is an absolutely wonderful show having the right mix of comedy,emotion and craziness.Hats off to Chuck Lorre for bringing another grat show.Im so relieved to find a comedy show that has started airing quite recently that has clever writing and jokes that make you laugh out loud and also helps build a feeling of closeness towards the characters,Most of the comedy genre shows aired nowadays are just about the pilot.They have a theme which pretty much fizzles out a a few show after the pilot and then they are left wih a main character and a few goofy friends to take it forward.But not this show-This is a breath of fresh air that I was waiting for!"
71,"Oh man this show is so funny that totally makes me laugh all the way, and thats exactly what one can ask by a comedy show.Im really stunned reading some reviews here on IMDb about how bad this is and that its not funny ,i cant believe that there are people that judge this show so harshly.I also read 1 review saying how much the pregnancy episodes will affect the teenage girls and they will find it cute to be pregnant too.And i have to say if those teens get pregnant cause they saw it on Mom they have much bigger problems than a baby, mostly educational and luck of common sense.Its really funny and i suggest to all that you should watch 1-3 episodes and make your own minds instead of listening to those haters."
72,"I can only say I have loved the show from episode one and if anything it has improved with each episode. Its handles the dark world of addiction in a sympathetic way and while very humorous it is never vindictive or pretentious. I have found myself drawn to Bonnie and Christie and find myself actually caring what happens to them. That to me is always the sign of a top class show, The sitcom has an able support cast including French Steward for 3rd Rock. Some of the AA sharing sessions are hilarious and remind me of similar scenes in One flew over the Cuckoos nest. Totally demented and manic. I hope the show enjoys a long run. it deserves too because it is a breath of fresh air on TV right now. And on a final note, I find Allison Janney ""La Bella Donna"" on TV right now ;)"
73,"Having not heard much about the show, I thought a sitcom with Anna Faris would be good, this particular sitcom, is not all that good. The casting is wrong, in particular, Allison Janney, who plays Anna Faris' mother and Sadie Calvano, who plays her daughter, they just don't feel right as characters, Matt Jones (Breaking Bad) and French Stewart (3rd Rock From The Sun) are pretty good in the show. French Stewart was the only shining light in the first episode, he was the only reason it was funny. And honestly, he was the only reason I gave the 2nd and 3rd episodes a try, but I think that this show doesn't really have what it takes to be a ground breaking sitcom. When it comes to a multi camera sitcom, the cast and their relationship with each other is important, I just don't believe these characters as a family, it just feels like actors talking. With this cast and this premise, it might have worked out better as a single camera comedy with different writing. This show probably won't last long."
74,"Season 8 episode 1 was kind of a bust. But I'll stick with the series for Janney & Co. Faris must have gone bonkers to quit just after signing for seasons 8 and 9.Well, there we have it...Faris left to pursue other opportunities. Perhaps, but certainly not better ones."
75,"This is a review after completing 7 seasons of Mom, unlike many who write after watching 1 ep or the first season.
The characters are flawless. Christy is superb, her mom is smart. Other ladies have wonderful roles too. Season 1 started with a bang. The first episode was a lot more fun than other 20, however,22nd was the best. That's the best episode in the complete Mom series. However, there are many heart-touching episodes yet to come.
The story gets better, newer with every season continuing the cast, their problems and the AA. AA is something new we watched in recent years. This was something that we learnt from. However, as the story goes on, with AA always being the highest priority parts of it, it gets better if not funnier. Season 1 has the best comedy, fun, however, after that from every season we start connecting to them more and more which is always wonderful. Season 6 was the best of all followed by 3rd and 1st. Season 5 was the worst. Adam was great, second best after the most loving Christy. However, his brother sucked. As soon as the series progresses, the comedy centres Jill, which is a lot of fun. The show isn't as sexier as we expect it to be, only sex word is spoken atleast once in each episode. Not recommended with family, as words like Vagina, sex, penis, even boobs are taken regularly. Marjorie is the most decent one in that despite having her good share.
But I do recommend if that's okay for anyone. It has good humor, great characters, well-directed and good fun.
7.5/10"
76,This show is pretty fun and it helps that it also has a fantastic cast.
77,"I just love this show! It is just so clever, the entire series. I have been glued to it since the first season all the way till 7. The humor is still there and it's one of them series that do not go downhill as the series progress."
78,I use to love this show but ever since they got rid of the kids it went downhill bad!!
79,"I've been watching this show from its very beginning. And its evolution is astonishing. It has added new characters and new story arcs, allowed its characters to change along with their circumstances, and shifted its focus from a two character relationship to those of an ensemble cast of extremely skilled performers who very effectively play characters that complement each other despite their very different biographies. The bottom line is that plots and characters convey a message of tolerance and of the importance to consider others and appreciate one another no matter ones's past mistakes.As have others here, I find it incredible that some viewers find its very humane, often touching, treatment of a variety of very human issues objectionable. Frankly, the naysayers show their ignorance and lack of understanding. Don't pay any attention to them and if you haven't tried watching this, do so, and do aim to catch it from the very beginning because it's developmental arc is awesome."
80,This show is absolutely wonderful. Something new! Makes you cry one minute and laugh the next. Anna Faris and Allison Janney are amazing together. My new favorite show
81,"Okay:Two and a half women. Good. Fine.
Deals with addiction pretty well. Great
Faris and Janney prove their genius. Yeah!
Ungrateful preggo daughter. O-kaaaay...Here's the HUGE oversight; other than an actually FUNNY French Stewart, everyone forgot to have solidly, uniquely funny supporting characters.Look at every truly funny sitcom; we watch for the others! Frasier is one of my abs FAVORITE, but I almost despise the Frasier character. DHP, JL, PG and especially John Mahoney make the show. M*A*S*H, Cheers, 2.5 Men, Taxi, E L Raymond, Home Improvement, Seinfeld (whose 4 mains are terrible peeps, really) and blah de blah de blah.Janney and Faris are both incredibly awesome and have some serious star power and comedic chops but they have the super majority of funny thrust upon their collective shoulders.Lorre or someone dropped that ball."
82,"This is such a great show! I laugh, cry and always look forward to watching it whenever it is on even if it is a re-run.
S4E4 Episode: Soo very true and thank you SOO much to the writers for bringing up this situation. It happens! And I appreciate it up so that others know how to deal with it.
These characters ARE true to life & the situations are so common.
So again, thank you - great show, great choice on actors and actresses - please do not take this off the air!"
83,"A lot of Building Manager/Maintenance workers can get tips, and we see in the later seasons she actually does do her job now. Also, I think Adam is always making sure she has funds for expenses and fun things, to help her out."
84,Used to like this show much better. Not a fan of the Tammy character.
85,"I only started watching this show in reruns in early 2018 and quickly found its charm. I've since binged the entire series. It's probably the most ""real"" sitcom I've seen. It IS a sitcom, but it approaches some really tough topics. Although there have been some character changes throughout, Bonnie and Christy are the key players. Their extended group (which is a great balance of different personalities) are in a recovery program and have dealt with relapse, death, jail time, etc. These are issues that a person in recovery would truly deal with. (Having family/friends go through AA and Celebrate Recovery, I've seen it firsthand). I really appreciate that it depicts even the messy part of life. I wouldn't think this could be done well on a sitcom, so I'm impressed ""Mom"" has managed to do it. There is a sweetness in each stumble, and a lesson to be learned. Everyone who likes the show has a favorite character. Jaime Pressly is the one that never fails to make me laugh, but the entire cast really play off each other very well. It's really a fun show to watch! And probably is very meaningful to a person going through recovery too!"
86,I just recently started watching this show and I think it is absolutely hilarious.
87,"I'm a recovering addict and I thought that this show was absolutely hilarious. The casting was just perfect and I love the storyline. The banter is so witty and keeps your attention for the entire show. I will say that I liked the earlier shows better than the newer ones, because the newer ones seem to just be Bonnie and Christie fighting for the whole 30 minutes. I would have given it a 10/10 rating, if it wasn't for that! I'm hoping that it goes back to how it used to be; funny, whitty and totally relatable."
88,"While the show does attempt to develop a blueprint of consequences to the behavior being exhibited, there is a glaring aspect of drinking and pregnancies. All the recovery and apologies and acceptance and bail money shouldn't be allowed to paper over the consequences of fetal alcohol syndrome from drinking while pregnant. It adds to the surreal atmosphere of real world behavior and hollywood trying to develop a meaningful dialogue. Would that be too much harshing one's mellow in a comedy series? It's difficult to have it both ways - addressing real consequences while trying to be entertaining. 
That said, the acting and production is well within the parameters for succeeding as a long running series."
89,"First of all I have to admit that I have never really liked Anna Faris, and the reason for that, was probably because of her role as Cindy Campbell in the ""Scary Movie"" films. But her role as Christy definitely suits her, and she is doing heck of a great job at playing a single mom. She's got a lot of up and downs to deal with like everyone else. She also have her kids and a troubling mother to deal with besides that. But with a good portion of sarcasm and a twinkle in her eyes, she's got the most of it handled pretty darn well. :)Oh and not to mention Allison Janney as Bonnie, are just simply spot on! She is without a doubt my favorite character in this show. Definitely a woman after my taste.. I mean, come on? She is just perfect for this role. No one could have done a better job! So if you have a sense of humor and like to laugh, I'll recommend you go and watch it right this second, 'cause it's just that good, and really hilarious. :)P.s. I don't get why this show is being compared to Two and A Half Men? Somethings are similar, but really? -_-'"
90,"I have liked other Lorre projects like Grace under Fire, Dharma & Greg and original Two and a Half Men, and love(watch every single week)The Big Bang Theory. But this show actually is painful, painful to watch. The only funny part in the show is French Stewart. Allison Janney and Anna Faris, Sadie Calvano and Anna Faris, Anna Faris and the customers, Anna Faris and her boyfriend. Just not funny. It feels forced. I don't know if it is the writing or the actors. Sometimes it can be sweet - but just not funny. Its almost if the writing is trying to be funny but the timing is off. I think the show is trying to take a really sad situation and trying to make it funny."
91,"Anna Faris used to star in her own movie comedies. Now she's doing this lowest common-denominator drivel. Another doorknob show from Chuck Lorre. Want to end your movie career? Do a show where you're a single parent. Any movie with a child or baby in it ends up being awful. It is like 2 and half men, in that it stinks and is totally dependent on the inane laugh track.Anybody else sick of Chuck Lorre shows? Big Bang, 2 and a half men, Mike and Molly?Gonna miss Anna in the movies. She's done. I give this show some marks for Allison Janney is okay and Anna does her best with the lukewarm, trashy material. At least it's better than the similarly, and brilliantly named, Dads. Leave it to TV to try to come up with the worst and dullest titles. Mom, Dads, Friends, New Girl... whats next? People. He. She. Rock. Funny. Sports. Food. Beer. D-uh. Whuh?. Brown. Cat. Box."
92,"It's the worst comedy of the season. And I'm saying this after checking out duds like 'The Trophy Wife' and 'Welcome to the Family'. Anna Faris used to be likable once upon a time, but she's just washed up now. No offense to her. I like her, but I've hated everything she has been in since Scary Movie 3. The one playing her mother is supposed to be a female version of Charlie Sheen, is she? Well, it doesn't work.It's as repetitively bad as Two and a Half Men. I did get into this thinking it might be another 'Big Bang theory', but it isn't, by a long shot. Come to think of it, it's hard to believe Lorre, the creator of this trash and the trash which had Charlie Sheen in it CREATED the big bang theory too. No, I don't believe it!"
93,"Tune-in for fun situations like the dry-drunk Mom accusing her daughter of sleeping with the Dean when daughter makes the Dean's list.
Celebrate the bond of parenthood when it's revealed that dry-drunk Mom could have placed her child in a loving adoptive home, but instead selfishly deprived the child of a family in more ways than one.
Chuckle at the generations of damage caused by an amusing cycle of abuse and neglect.
The whole show is more fun than a do-it-yourself vasectomy."
94,Literally cannot stand christy after the 3rd season midway the 4th she gets really annoying.
95,The Mom show is my favorite. Allison Janney is perfect in this role as is Anna Faris. The writing and directing is responsible for such a successful show as is the excellent choice of casting. I appreciate the lessons that each episode works into the script. Allison Janney has a gift of deliverance of lines and stage presence ever since The West Wing. Codo's to all associated with this funny funny show.
96,"Mom has gotten a lot of points with critics and understandably so. While the show is called ""Mom"" it could just as easily be called ""AA Group"" as the show has morphed to include Mimi Kennedy and Jaime Pressley in central roles as fellow AA members who are also down on their luck.The old adage is that TV is generally a place for the rich and well-to-do. It's not an understatement to say these characters are among the richest representations of the troubled American working-class on TV.But the show is called ""Mom"" for a reason and that is its biggest selling point: The relationship between central characters Christy (Anna Faris) and mother Bonnie (Allison Janney). The character of Bonnie has netted Allison Janney a couple of Emmys to date for a reason: She's a highly amusing catalog of every morally wrong way to raise a daughter with just enough moments of heart to make her worth rooting for. Naturally, it produces a lot of resentment in her daughter but the two are dirt poor enough to have no options but each other. The two share an interesting equilibrium of accepting the other as flawed people.One of the main flaws is that this show can't overcome the old trappings of single camera sitcoms: Meaningful scenes and attempts to gradually build humor are cut short by the need for a punchline every 30 seconds to keep the live audience laughing and the writer's room can't keep supply aligned with demand in this case."
97,Mom it's awesome show but there's so many commercials it's like there's 15 minutes of show I wish that show was longer
98,"Love it so far! A lot of shows these days are just too ridiculous and insensitive (stupid and unclassy to me) to be funny. This is not that show, Its hilarious!! And i would love to watch it with any manic friends because they would laugh and feel not so alone I think . It's smart, shining a light on characters in a human intelligent way and not sappy. Hope the writers can keep it up and not fall into the lewd rut like Sat nite live did or turn into one liners with one member being overly moronic to the straight guy. I also love ""Last Man Standing"", Very funny also, good family show."
99,"First few episodes weren't that great but it gets way better later! I feel like all the good work chuck Lorre was putting on the big bang theory and two and a half men transferred somehow to this sitcom (which kind of speaks loads about how downhill the two hit sitcoms are going recently) anyways, i really like this show and i hope there are many more episodes and hopefully seasons to come, i love Christi and Bonnie, a lot of people call them two and a half women, but i feel like this sitcom is way funnier than two and half men, it has lighter, less dirty humor. the jokes are really funny, some times i laugh through the entire episode which is really rare. Good job chuck! :)"
100,"So much I don't like. I have seen Ms. Janney and Ms. Faris elsewhere and found them off-putting. Their characters are also unlikeable. Bonney is deceitful, self-centered and manipulative. Christy is whiney and self-pitying. I don't care much for the rest of the characters either, with the exception of Wendy and Margery. I did like the kids, but they have been eliminated from the shows. I had watched this off and on for the first few seasons, and found myself going from liking a little to disliking a lot. Where I live, there are 2 episodes every evening. They come on after a show I do like, and if I am out of the room when it starts, I have to hurry in to change the channel. I have many choices, time-wise, for evening news, but the 'MOM hour' is now my news hour."
101,"I'm not a big sit-com fan, but I love Mom! The characters are hilarious, as are the one-liners."
102,"The chemistry of the cast is what drives the show. The six main women in the show complement each other superbly: Christy and her can-do attitude, Bonnie and her practical sarcasm, the mousy Wendy, the snobbish Jill, the maternal Marjorie, and now the socially clumsy Tammy, make for (IMO) a superior core cast than that found in any sit-com since the times of Seinfeld and Friends.I started watching as usual: sit-coms for me are background noise. But now I actually watch. And the themes touched are interesting, always keeping it light enough. Yes, the relationship between Christy and her daughter Violet is a dark part of the show, but it infuses realism in it.I hate to say this but Chuck Lorre hit another winner with this one."
103,"My favorite is the episode when Mom gets a DNA kit for her birthday and after getting the results she finds out her father is still alive and not the guy she thought was her father. Her real father is played by John Lithgow and their meeting is epic. When it happens. this episode, and the three others that go with it have not been written yet, but can you imagine the back and forth between Allison Janney and John Lithgow!?"
104,Haven't missed an episode from day 1. I don't understand how this can be so good and most every other half hour show be so bad. It has to be the writers and whoever paces the action of the show because both are just about perfect. The most wonderful thing about this show is you come away with a lot of laughs and you learn something more about alcoholics. I hope this show goes on forever and all the actors make millions from it .
105,"Spoiler alert. I was a big fan of this show and loved the role reversal humor. The drug and alcohol addiction was handled with humor and compassion. I liked how the importance of strong female friendships were emphasized, and the realism of Christie not getting into law school and problems with her children. But this year they went overboard, piling on gambling addiction and their home being taken over by an ex-con. That was just too much. I didn't want to watch anymore. It wasn't necessary to add these extra issues. I really dislike the ex-con character."
106,"Just awful , i watched because i always like chuck Lorre productions , big bang theory , two and a half men , i even liked mike and molly , but this was plain garbage .the first episode was good , i liked the second one too , i got some laughs , some feels , but it went down hell from there . the 10th episode was my breaking point , i cant stand this anymore , i didn't laugh at all after the 6th episode , i couldn't even force my self to watch this garbage , if you want comedy don't watch this ever .try other chuck Lorre productions like big bang theory or two and half men , but not this , don't try this ."
107,"I am a breast cancer survivor and I found this show one show regarding breast cancer to be very insensitive. While I was having radiation and chemotherapy, I never saw anyone sitting in the waiting room ""plumping up"" their breasts. I saw women just like me, worrying if they would live and if they didn't, what would happen to their children, husband and family. Men get breast cancer as well. There is nothing funny about breast cancer, no matter whether or not you find a son who doesn't get along with his mother but texts her at the end. Too little sensitivity too late. If there was a zero, I would give this show a zero but I am stuck with a 1. I will never watch this show again and have taken ""Mom"" off my DVR. I am very offended."
108,"Perhaps I missed the best this show had to offer in it's early years, but stumbled across the show tonight so decided to watch an episode.Sorry, but it was a HUGE disappointment. Not a single laugh or even a smile during the entire show. Janney's won a half dozen Emmys, but here, at least tonight, she just phoned in her performance.And the laugh track? This one is SO obvious, so fake, so not infectious. HAHAHAhahahhaha. HAHAHAHAHhahahaha.If the show was funny, it wouldn't need one."
109,"Kristy can't act nor is she very pretty; her Mom is far more talented and funny. I love Tammy, who must be Chris Farley's sister. Jill is a hoot and the smartest plus has the best physique; Wendy deserves a break, needs more assertiveness; marjorie is just well marjorie but lovingly dependable; Violet was a b****; and Roscoe (kristy's ex was cool; kristy's son--what was his name?? Adam is too good to be true, pretty cute though ,but pretty much a flat character; really liked kristy's hyper-insultive lawyer boss; she needs more air time some how; love the old blind man. I think that's everybody. ps.: love marjorie's cats! Can't wait till next season w/o kristy!"
110,"After this show has been on for years and I always ducked it, quite by accident I watched an episode while at the gym and it got me interested. I've been binge watching ever since, trying to catch up to the present from the earlier seasons.It's a comedy but the show has very few laugh out loud moments for me. It's kind of cartoonish, but yet watchable. Bonnie is really quite narcissistic and superficially charming but otherwise, barely moral and at times, repulsive. You can't help but watch because actress Allison Janney is strangely appealing, no matter what she does. Jill (played by perpetually gorgeous Jamie Pressly) is utterly self absorbed and cartoonish in presentation as well. Both actresses are entertaining in the roles but in essence their roles are cartoonish. Although I'm sure there are plenty of people around who behave just like them in real life...sadly.Anna Faris is likeable as Christie, who seems to be a good egg, and perhaps the most ""normal"" of the bunch. Marjorie is fine as the group's true matriarch of sorts, but Wendy seems like originally an extra who was upgraded to part of the ensemble but whose character doesn't add much or get to do much.The relationship between Bonnie and Adam is just plain annoying. Both tend to act idiotic towards the other, frequently. Also, does it make an ounce of sense that Bonnie could safely be with someone who's pretty much always getting drunk or high, and then opens a bar ??? That's complete nonsense.What is it with all these shows that make children behave repulsively ? What a terrible example......and how is that ever supposed to be funny ? Whenever Roscoe or especially Violet were in scenes, they were completely cringe-worthy. How much worse is it to write kids into the show, then magically make them disappear as if they were never there ? Shaking my head about that.This show works best when the five friends confab and help each other. Guess that's why I'm still watching."
111,"Worst comedy ever!
Terrible set 'em up knock 'em down one liners.
Nothing but self-deprecating humor.
So dumb. No imagination at all. Who writes this crap? 12 year olds.
Real life seriously!! Who would want a mother like that!!
And if it is....well that goes a long way in explaining young women today and why they have no self respect.
Horrible show. Shameful actually."
112,"Are people this low minded to watch this Udder crap ( yes they are)? AREN'T people ( viewers) lorre shows either degrating watchers and or being looked dont apond. Big bang Theory with highly educated putdowns how common people just dont know shows actors are casted as. Then this pile of crap of Mother and Daughter that are socially Inept that its a disgrace women and people that have drinking problems. If this is what people believe is good viewing, then its known that watchers are more stupid then the people that think up crap like this genre. These days sad that shows like this are considered award winning. Not everyone likes this low level belittling humor."
113,This show made me feel sick. There is nothing funny about an old scrubber of a mom who's addictions negatively affected her daughter. It is purely offensive to those whom was raised by an addict ie me! It is life destroying pain I am telling you. This should not be promoted as a comedy but rather a documentary on a really dark network channel. This show should never be aired again but recalled and a decent apology to those who nearly wept at the first episode and needed to call their therapists. Shame big time on all involved in this abortion of a show. DISGUSTING
114,"I've seen a few episodes when I've stayed in hotels and found it on tv. Man was this show funny. I found it on Hulu and started binge watching it! I love this show so much. Allison Janney has been funny in everything I see her in and this is no different! Amazing show!I'm on season 6 now and I just have to say, I hate Violet so so much."
115,"Might this be an idea? The writers could really make a statement for all those who would like to see people eye-to-eye for the first time...or who want to have that view-point again...Taking the height difference or the reality of Miss Janney's 6'1"" frame would really allow many the pleasure they may not see in their build."
116,I like this comedy situation. Especially when Christy and their AA meeting friends try to stay sober and keep their sobriety. Thank you CBS for making this great comedy!
117,I can't breathe whenever I am watching this show! 10/10 Two thumbs up. üëçüëç
118,This series is addictive to watch over and over. Its really funny. They have picked up a peculiar concept and made it funny but also have balanced the seriousness and humor. The character building is superb too
119,"I'm so fed up with cookie cutter sitcoms that have good actors saying awful lines. The first time I tried to watch this I thought this was just another one of those. A couple of years later I was channel surfing and found this again. They were in an AA meeting...Something I know well. I watched the entire show and when it was done I set my DVR to record all the reruns the station played every day. Eventually I saw every episode (Within a month maybe) up to the 2018 Fall season....Then I continued to watch the entire series a second time...And still was laughing.The writing is damn good. The lead characters play off each other in a way that you believe they are a mother/daughter team. All the other members are great support members too. This is such a well done sitcom that I'm kind of surprised it has lasted this long. Good sitcoms often get dumped while dumb sitcoms go on and on. I think it's the combination of what I just mentioned plus the fact that they do show these damaged women as working hard to be functional and improving their lives. In doing so they do what people in recovery usually do....Look at the dumb stuff as being dumb and funny...Even if you're sober at the time. It's not all fun and laughs though. They do hit some very troubling problems along the way, but they don't dwell on them. They deal with them, get strength from each other, and move on....A great sitcoms indeed"
120,"Sitcoms these days seem to mostly be about agenda driven virtue signaling, or they are the new style fast paced Larry David style works that just presses the accelerator the whole episode...just too much.Mom is a rare gem in the sea of terrible sitcoms. It really has that old feel of the sitcoms in the good ole days, except with modern content and issues. It's a very ""adult"" sitcom, which I like. There is a content age rating system for a reason and web sites for parents to check on maturity ratings like ""Common Sense Media"" who rates Mom as an age 15+ program. I recommend people actually do a little research and maybe look for the rating that often shows when a program starts on TV. The reviewers here complaining that it's not for kids are responsible for any kids they allowed to view the show. It's also interesting to see the recovering or ex addicts criticize the show. Whats really interesting is that there are some positive addicts...most sober addicts are sticks in the mud who think none of us should be allowed to watch a program that is about alcoholism and even some pot smoking and other drugs in the content. I'm an alcoholic who has struggled off and on for years, this show deals with it in reality...people do fail and have to start all over. I've never been an AA fan, its corny to me, but there are a LOT of people helped very much by AA. Whatever works is what people should do.This show is quirky, funny, serious and sometimes sad. There is always a life lesson in every episode. At least in most of the earlier seasons this show doesn't get in to social political correctness, politics, doesn't insert LGBT agenda (although reading that Rosie O'donnel is in season 6, this concerns me as she lives and breathes this agenda)...I read the negative reviews about the quality of the show, etc., and I wonder what some people are expecting tuning in to a sitcom. I watch sitcoms for low mental commitment superficial entertainment. Mom delivers that with some serious life lesson points sprinkled in...like all of the classics do."
121,"I randomly saw this show on TV and it made me laugh. I am happy Anna Faris did this series, I recommend it."
122,"I actually discovered the sitcom on a channel that was running three or four reruns every morning. I got caught up on one episode and laughed so much I decided to record them all every day. Eventually I went through the whole series and really enjoyed the majority of the shows. So I never saw the beginning of the Fall series and only saw two episodes before winter break. Since it came back I've watched continue to get worse and worse. I don't know if it's the writing, the directing, or maybe both. It has gone from being funny and clever to being just another mindless mess like so many sitcoms out there. Especially now that there's no more kids they have Christy acting like the little girl in a mother/daughter relationship that was missed decades ago. According to the previews next week Bonnie and that ex con meet up with a past foster mother they once lived with and now they will pretend to be little girls in their 50's.I see they are renewed for another season. If they don't get back to being clever again by next season, then I'll quickly drop them"
123,I decided to give this failed abortion a chance and I was treated to a story about a 40 year old woman and her elderly mother buying a house together. What is their target audience? Sad old ladies? CBS does it again.
124,"This series endorses (by omission of criticism) the single mother concept, giving away a child to adoption, it essentially breaks all concept of home and family. The main actresses are Mother/Daughter, where the older one is the worst concept of mother possible, all of this glorified of course. This is essentially an ultra feminist series, where men have no great role and in a way portrays women as victims. Essentially the message is: ""we look at men as inferior, replaceable, but we're alone because of them. And we'll make it fine without a real household."""
125,"I doubt any of the writers read this, that being said this episode was extremely disturbing. Drunken creepy idiots are not funny. Waking to find a drunk guy in your bed is not funny. The end had these alcoholics seeking help but really, addiction and assault really aren't funny. Yes the struggle is real, people trying to be sober are subjected to drunken idiots but too many people have been subjected to these things and it's not real funny. What's next? Making light of domestic violence. It's all good though I will remember to read a book and turn off the TV. It seems like most sitcoms resort to just joking about sex or sexual situations. I find this trend to be quite immature. The older episodes were better. I love the actors but they deserve better writing."
126,"If I cared about the lives of dysfunctional and vaguely-attractive women, I'd talk to the women I bring home from the bar.I don't.As such, this show holds no appeal for me. I can't empathize with any of the characters. That's a big strike.Jokes are decent, and this is better than the Big Bang Theory. Still, this is a typical Lorre show, and everything he's put together has been crap except Two and a Half Men with Charlie Sheen, and that was all Charlie.The attempts at drama are decent - I'll give the show that. But, not caring about any of the protagonists make these attempts fall flat. I just can't bring myself to give a **** about any of the characters. Which means they are useful for an evening where I have nothing else to do, but otherwise get ignored."
127,I love this show! Allison and Anna are so great! Whoever casted Kristin Johnson deserves a raise!!! She is sooo funny in this show! Please let her stay until the end! This show IS the reason I have Hulu Live!!!
128,"As someone who struggles with addiction, (and who hates sitcoms) I'm so grateful that this show exists. I've never seen the fight portrayed so perfectly. It's not easy to make such a painful and life-ruining disease funny but they manage it and it's honestly is what convinced me to start going to meetings. Thank you for Mom."
129,"Nice way to start the new season. As funny as ever. The 1 star reviewers must be viewers late to the game. This was well written, acted and produced. Glad CBS hung onto some of their high budget shows. With ""Big Bang"" gone CBS has hit the panic button on some of their new shows. They have canceled shows that were doing well enough in the ratings to renew, but would rather can those shows for unfunny ABC, NBC type cheaper comedies. Hoping to find the next ""Big Bang Theory"". Mom"" is still a winner with a hilarious cast. Definitely near the top of the CBS comedies if not at the top. Keep the laughs coming!"
130,"As someone living with my own and family addiction issues, this show has meant the world to me.
On my worst days, I find myself repeating some dialogue in my head from Christy & Marjorie.
I'm sure it's not a show for everybody, but I'm sure everybody could benefit from an episode or two somewhere in the mix."
131,"I get that the basic premise of the show is a newly-sober daughter living with her also newly sober mother. That said, the show is chock full of back-and-forth references about the other's substance abuse/arrests/etc. I also have yet to see a show that doesn't show footage of their AA meeting. My wife binge watches this. I leave the room. The writing isn't even that creative."
132,"When i saw the lovely Anna Farris was doing a sitcom i was excited to watch the show. But already in the first episode i could clearly see the show is just 'another American sitcom'. The story about the mother who made mistakes in the past en is trying to get things in its place again is a good storyline but it is just horribly made. The only advantage i could find was Breaking Bad's Badger is the father of one of the children but the rest is useless.Why do they cast Anna Farris as a 'horrible mom who used to drink', she looks so innocent. If they had Kim Kardishian to do the show it would be more believable.So i gave it 3/10, i must say i am surprised by the relatively high ratings from the IMDb users"
133,Why do people watch this show about addicts trying to be funny about a serious problem? Canned laughter some how makes it acceptable to audiences? Really? The show is stupid and offensive. Why anyone watches it is beyond me. Give your heads a shake people!! Don't bother wasting your time on this show.
134,"**May Contain Spoilers**This is one of the worst shows I've ever seen--dismal, unfunny (despite the obnoxious laugh track), and desperate. Alison Janney and Anna Faris must have been badly in need of employment to accept these roles. Alison Janney looks awful--long, unkempt hair that drags her face down and thick rings of eyeliner on her lids, which is pretty much all you see when you look at her face. I have no idea why TV Land bought this series (of course, this is the same network that brought us the terrible ""Younger"" and ""Teachers""). They run ads for this series almost nonstop throughout the day. People tune in to TV Land to watch classic television, not dreck about sex-obsessed singles, inappropriate teachers, and drug addicts. Please stop subjecting us to the worst that TV has to offer."
135,"Chuck Lorre and his productions have been around since I have been a kid! Some of his shows have been big hits that I've really enjoyed. I absolutely love Allison Janney, she's one of THE best, most talented actresses, and she's incredibly funny as well. So when I saw she was in this new show I was excited to see that. Although, I wasn't excited about Anna Faris. and I'm sorry to say I've never found her entertaining in any way or funny either. I'm also sorry to say, there's just something about her that I find annoying and hard to watch/listen to. Since I love Allison Janney so much, I did give a couple episodes a try. The show being about a white trash/dysfunctional family is true to life, yes, but I just found nothing funny about it . The laugh track is irritating as well. So is Faris, just can't get past my dislike for her. I'm glad I stopped watching because I heard Rosie O'Donnell was on the show for several episodes. Yeaaa, no thanks. Most definitely not a fan. Allison Janney is waaaay above Faris on the talent and funny scale, so I'm not sure what she was thinking teaming up with her or this show. She can't be hard up for money. 
This unfunny terrible show running for as long as it has is mind boggling. They should've stuck a fork in this show a long time ago imho, because it's been done since the very start of it."
136,So glad they keep adding seasons to it! Great! Excellent! Funny! Crazy! Heartwarming all together! Did I mention hilarious? ü§£üòÇ
137,"A serie about women world. Provocative, amusing, ironic. A mother, her dauther and a lot of friends. A sort of mix of Two and a Half Men and Sex and the City. In my case, good opportunity to discover my conservative ( and mysoginious ) side. But, sure, a nice comedy serie."
138,"I love Alison Janey and Anna Ferris. And the first two seasons are great. But honestly, I don't care any more about the macob comedy, how many times can you really watch people relapse, go back to meetings. end up in jail, have a housing crisis and watch another person relapse?"
139,"I was very upset at this episode. It was offensive to me as my husband was a firefighter and could or would never steal a fire truck. He would have been fired from his job and fined . Firefighters are not party animals and drunks as this episode depicted. They are hard working men and women. They rush into fires to save lives and when you need one you will very happy they are on the job. The union of firefighters, 718, should be protesting this show. You would never show police officers, doctors or lawyers in this light. I don't think you could do this with any other profession. I may never watch this show again. I will make sure my family and friends know how I feel too. I am very upset. Please give some sort of apology."
140,"Chuck Lorre is one of the creator of the show, who is one of the best currently Hollywood has. The series follows the love hate relationship between a Mom played by Academy Award Winner Allison Janney alongside Anna Faris as her Daughter, keeping with their sobriety with a struggling Economic & Social conditions. Mom has every set of emotions including Humor, Laughs, Sadness, happiness etc. Allison Janey is the Star of the show. She has also got Emmy for her role as Bonnie Plunkett .With some good performances by its regular and recurring cast along with a strong message & writing this Tv-series is totally recommended"
141,"Let's just get this out of the way: ALLISION JANNEY IS A COMEDIC GODESS!!This is a pretty funny show that also manages to address struggles of addiction and recovery with the depth and heart that is frankly surprising in a sitcom.None of these women's victories comes easy, the hits keep on coming, often times self-inflicted; but these women are determined to raise their heads above the rapids at all costs, so much so that you root for them when they overcome and your heart breaks when they fall.Perfect writing, perfect cast, which means you do more than laugh, you really learn something."
142,"Wow
This is a very good sitcom
I keep watching episode after episode
I'm about to finish the 3rd season
The show is in the 6th season now
I hope they keep it more years
I remember Anna faris from the last season in FRIENDS
I loved her so much
She is amazing"
143,This program is a realistic and emphatetic teacher about addiction and Alcoholics Anonymous.
144,It breaks my heart to even think that this show might come to an end. I'm obsessed with the bundle of talent and amazing cast and show writing of this series. Please continue making this forever. And Allison Janney and Anna Farris are killing it with their brilliant performance üòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòÇüòÇ
145,This show! It tackles very difficult things in life - in a touching way ... but never forgets the humor in life's happenings. The episode where Marjorie's husband died - and she said she felt relief was amazing. That was such a true and heartfelt statement. Yes-she was still sad; but relief is what she felt for Victor AND herself. The episode on 11/15/2018 made me cry. Violet tells her mother she's better without her mother in her life. I fully understand why. My father was an alcoholic and my mother tried to hide it from the world. When Violet said she was afraid to bring friends home AND deal with things no child should ever have to deal with - I understood. This show brings on a lot of emotions - laughing and crying --- just the way life is! Such a gem...
146,I love the show ! It's pretty funny. Not sure why some people want to be prudes and give bad reviews guess they have no sense of humor! Yes about a family with the main characters are recovering addicts trying to get through life as non addicts but puts a funny spin on it and some times heartwarming not everyone's life is filled with daisies and cotton candy! And the creators seem to get that!! Love it !!
147,I love this show.... It's halariously true to its topic and they do it in such a funny way sometimes I cry I'm laughing so hard. Keeps me goin
148,Allison Janney is the best part of the show. She's hilarious.
149,"I do not write reviews often but I have to say I kind of accidentally strolled into this show when it was playing on tv and unbelievably had never heard of it....being able to laugh at yourself in alcoholism and addiction is so important and this show hits on some key points that take place in the world of recovery. As hilarious as this show it, there are very real and touching moments throughout the series. I have fallen in love with every single actress in the show! The primary cast is amazing but well into the third season, you realize that every single actor in this film plays an essential part in making this series top notch! Love love love!!!"
150,"I've only really been watching late at night when it's repeated on a few different networks now, but I can honestly say I don't see how it can be labeled a comedy. The networks I've been catching it on don't exactly believe in following seasonal order when they run 2 episodes in a row (can be a little time line confusing) one episode from season 2 the next from season 3, but episodes the next day are the next episode in season so, it's easy to piece together. But to label this as JUST a comedy...even though they are from different seasons, the last few episodes I've seen have left me choked up. The writing and acting results in real, yes at times funny at times heartbreaking situations. The mother daughter relationships between Bonnie, Christy and Violet are pretty realistic. At times love, others less than love, the typical resentment of some ""failure"" on mom's part."
151,"This show comes from the mind of Chuck Lorre, so if you've watched his other shows (Big Bang Theory, Two and a Half Men, Mike and Molly) you know exactly what you're getting.In a comedy you look for jokes, it's very simple. And this show, like his others has them by the bucket load. Many of them are funny, some of them are crass. However, just as you go to switch off there's a moment of heart that keeps you watching, and ultimately returning to the show. It was the same with 'Two and a half Men' (well, at least during the Charlie Sheen years'.'Mom' is not a classic show, it will not be remembered in years to come with mass fondness in the way 'Friends' is. However, it offers us weekly reminders of why Alison Janney is a fantastic actress, so must be commended.It's a typical 2010's comedy."
152,I started watching this from the beginning but stopped the middle of last season. I enjoy Christy but Allison Janey is just to obnoxious. Just cause she won an Oscar for the horrible performance in an awful movie. She now acts like owns the show. Don't miss it one bit
153,"This show really surprised me, I watched one episode when it started and really didn't like it. For some reason I checked it out again, and really began to like it. The recent addition of Kristen Johnson has really upped the game...."
154,Marvellous actresses and actors. Perfect producers. Georgeus directors. Intelligent writers. Well done!
155,I can't believe I just started watching this show last year. How did I miss this? It took just watching one episode to make it my must-see TV weekly ritual. And I don't have a lot of those - so it says something. This show is so well written. The writers capture the recovering alcoholic personality so well. Not many shows make me laugh out loud as often as I do watching this. On Thursdays with Young Sheldon and Carol's Second Act - it's a great line up.
156,The writing and jokes are hilarious and spot on in every episode and the depth of emotion in the story is still amazing. The chemistry that is between Alison Janney and Anna Faris is still just a fantastic as it has been since season one. The cast all gave the most hilarious and stupendous performances of the series
157,"Anyone else ever notice that the police photo of Christy says shes 6'2 when they dont let you wear heels when taking a police photo lol when she obviously looks 5'4-5'6 when shes w her tv mom. Great show but noticeable mistakes, I love the actress that plays as Christy, shes awesome and so funny :)"
158,This is life as most of us know it. I look forward to it. Casted perfectly.
159,"{1/10 stars F} Recommend? No; Only watched the first episode and that was too much.CONTENT ADVISORY: The show has many ""jokes"" about drug and alcohol abuse and use. Bonnie and Christy knowingly sleeping around with and ""dating"" married men, variety of sexual jokes and innuendo. Other unsavory language includes a comment from Christy's son that is playing a video game and he says something like, ""Cool! I can hit the hookers to get my money back!"" followed by the over used laugh track mentioned in other reviews.{1=F 2=D- 3=D 4=C- 5=C 6=B- 7=B 8=A- 9=A 10=A+}"
160,In season 1 a cow was put on southwest airline for years. The plane finally touched down in Denver for good because thats what they wanted to do with the cow.
161,"I just don't have words how this show puts up each and every situation of life in front of us, and makes us feel an easier way to tackle with them, Anna Faris , hats off, you are a superstar, Bonnie üòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑ is just love you and Adam, also Jill , what a class yarr üòç. Wendy, you make me feel like a character on my life , and a Majorie you hold the whole bunch of asses together. Love you all üíã"
162,"With so many great actors involved with this show, I don't think for a second this one will tank after the departure of Anna Faris.First of all, Allison Janney has more than enough talent to carry the show by herself, but then she's ""married"" to William Fichtner? He, too, has a tremendous amount of talent. Between the two of them, as well as the amazing rest of the cast (I wish we could see more Wendy!) this show can go on for as long as they want!To be fair, I was really starting to feel Christy was getting stale. She'd really gone as far as she could go, as she was STILL whining about her mom's treatment of her when she was younger. Also, she's graduating law school and will be on her way into that world. I kind of feel like, had Anna Faris stayed with the show, Christy was looking at a hard relapse because that's pretty much the only thing she could bring to the table at this point. She's already done everything else. (And this needs to be said: Christy hates it when Violet won't let her forget what a crappy mom she is/was, but won't let it go for her own mother?)I look forward to the comedy that ensues now that they can look for laughs anywhere but from Christy and her verbal mud slinging towards her mother."
163,"I never thought i would be so hooked to a sitcom comprising of women dealing with their womanly lifestyle and problems , but i was proven wrong in the pilot itself, it did a hell lot effect in terms of my relationship with my mom and sister. It did a lot of work not only entertaining but also in connecting with the lifes of many alcoholics ."
164,"Honestly I think this is the best sitcom show that I've ever watched! My mom, my sister and I always watch it together and we enjoy it so much. The humour and content is very relatable. I really hope this show gets more seasons!"
165,"This is one of my favorite shows, EVER!!
Keeps getting better. My wife & I almost died laughing during Season 4 episode 12."
166,"I absolutely love this show! I see a lot of people commenting on the lack of Roscoe and Violet in the later seasons, but the title ""Mom"" is just that, a title. Yes, Christie has trouble with her mother, and also that of her kids, but Bonnie has trouble with her mother and child, Jill lost her Mom and had a miscarriage and then fostered a child, and Marjorie has a issues with her son, etc. Honestly, I was glad when Violet left the show, because she was an entitled little princess who really didn't add much. She made a brief reappearance in season 6 with the ridiculous podcast which proved that after all Christie did for her, she was just a bitter, unthankful young lady. I do hope they still bring Baxter back for more, because he's hilarious. Adam and Andy really make me laugh the hardest. Both actors are amazing in this show, as are the majority of the others. Kudos guys!"
167,"I love watching how these ladies support each other as they go through the struggles of life together-sober.
I applaud the writers for sticking to the principles of the AA program as closely as they do."
168,"This show is amazing! It is really good therapy. We need something else besides the Mysteries, Science Fiction, and Horror. We just can't consume the same thing all the time; we need a diet many different genres of TV and movies. In a world like this, we REALLY need to break out into more comedies like MOM to help us escape every once in a while and try to heal and laugh. You will be all the better if you watch.
It covers most of life's problems that addicts and everybody else run into like poverty, hopelessness, but mostly people just like everyone else that fall and have to get back up. All of these characters are living one day at a time, and helping other fellow addicts recover, while accomplishing HILARIOUS results along the way.
It's laugh-out-loud funny, and very cleverly written. I have to agree with one reviewer and say the first season has a slow start, but it gradually gets a lot better, so HOLD ON and keep watching, you won't be disappointed for long.
Sometimes you have to go through the rough spots to get to the best ones."
169,I love this show even though i didnt learn about this show until a month ago. The mom is a mess and Jill omg those two are my favorites. I watch reruns everyday and also have some on my dvr.
170,"One of the best comedy shows ever, Alisson and Anna are doing a great job!"
171,"First season was the worse season but the series seemed to evolved into something funny and nice to watch...Nothing perfect/ something you'd like to watch but no anticipate a next season... -to my opinion...
But not horrible at allthe series shows a very nice perspective on the other side of drugs and...
Nothing much to say... Other then that the cast's got more potential then they could ever use in the show... But it's a starting point.... i guess"
172,The show is funny but the laugh track is annoying. Wish I could just mute that and watch these fun women act.
173,"Emmy winner Allison Janney plays mother to Anna Faris's character. Anna's character has two children from different fathers. She works as a waitress in an upscale restaurant in Los Angeles, California. I'm not sure if it's set there but just a guess. Both mother and daughter have issues with alcoholism and drugs. Her teenage daughter Violet is already displaying some of the same characteristics such as sleeping around with boys. There is a son too and his father stops by frequently. In the pilot, Jon Cryer makes an appearance. French Stewart plays an obnoxious chef. The show still needs fine tuning before it can succeed."
174,"in fact I don't know why I am still watching this show. I am one of those people who like to see things through to the end be they bad or good. This is bad! I do not actually laugh during this. It's typical American comedy that relies on crudeness for laughs rather than clever writing. Bit like two broke girls. I have never rated Anna Faris in any movies always thought she looked a bit cheap looking so cast perfectly for this role. There is not one thing I can think about that has made me laugh but I keep watching to see what happens. I would put it in the same class as 'Till Death, Mike and Molly, Anger Management, Dad. It's forced acting no natural comedy moments."
