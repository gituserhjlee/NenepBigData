0,"This has become my favorite regular show on the main networks.  The stories are good enough to keep me watching and the character interplay can be quite amusing at times.  Gibbs is great...watching the others react to him makes me chuckle.  Abby is perfectly believable, despite the goth overtones...she is strong, smart, yet still sexy and feminine.  I think Pauley Perette was the ideal actress to cast.  The writing seems to continue at an even keel...if nothing else getting better as more episodes are shown.  I think the producers have a hit here.  I go back each week.  Definitely worth your time...even if it means taping or tivo'ing it (which I do)...something to look forward to when I can't make 8:00 on Tuesday."
1,"and each episode speeds along all too quickly! I LOVE this show! What is there NOT to like? Rich story lines, strongly portrayed (and very human) personalities you can really warm to who play off each other brilliantly, all with their own distinctive quirks and  above all  the always wonderful Mark Harmon as main character! What more could you ask for in a show?! There's not a single character I'd change  none that irritate  they're all excellent. I consider it a bonus that it's the one thing on TV that all our family equally enjoy for different reasons. Even my father-in-law likes this and we normally have totally different viewing preferences! I was delighted when I heard that there was a second series imminent. Only problem is that living in England, who knows how long after it's shown in the US we'll get to see it! Fortunately it's worth the wait!"
2,"Easily one of the best shows on television today, suspenseful, humorous and real-not always pleasant or formulaic-but real! Just when I think Bellesario has gone too far in the ""lets screw up Jag"" sweepstakes (ok-2 episodes this year were actually good-the rest-terrible!)-he redeems himself with a show that is riveting, timely and funny at the right times!The casting, the writing, the overall look of the show is first class! Starting at the top with Mark Harmon, the sexiest man on TV-he also sets the tone with his right on portrayal of the most conflicted man on TV today! His obsession with Ari (the terrorist), his list of rules, then his tendency to think out of the box just adds to the spice and pace of this show. (Plus his constant dueling with DiNozzo-priceless!)An added plus is the inter meshing of the cast-David McCallum-funny, urbane- so hot! His stories are hysterical, then his sad commentary on the life or death of their latest subject-just gives you pause. His diatribe on the terrorist and what he did to his assistant alone is Emmy award stuff-don't mess with Ducky ever again! Then we have the reason for Rule 12-Special Agent Catlin Todd-the writers don't always have a clue as to her portrayal but she always pulls it off (and that humor of hers-the end lines alone are great!) I have to disagree as to the chemistry with Gibbs/Kate-it's there all right-hopefully we get to see something come of it in Season 2! The actors portraying Abby and DiNozzo-Pauly Perrette and Michael Weatherly are hysterical, yet right on in their portrayals-especially when DiNozzo thinks with his hormones and not with his brain-then turns around and saves the day-this show is a keeper! I can hardly wait for season 2!"
3,"At first when my husband would watch this show I wasn't really paying much attention and I would see this goth girl in the lab and think  ""what on earth is THAT?!?!?!"" Then, one night I sat and watched along with him and now I am totally hooked. Mark Harmon's character appears to be annoyed sometimes by the other characters actions etc. but you get the feeling he really likes his coworkers. I like David McCallum's character and the way they tease him about going on and on. I get the feeling he knows they really do like him but his stories just get to be too much for them and he understands. My favorite though is Pauley Perrette's character. She is just a lot of fun. I hope the show stays on a long time- Tuesday nights wouldn't be the same with out it."
4,"1st Zeva leaves, then Tony and finally Abby. The cast that built the legend on NCIS has been reduced to a couple now and the new adds (except for Maria Bello) are not providing the intrigue and drama that was the previous NCIS. As a devoted fan I am slowly but surely finding the show becoming a non- watch instead of a must see. We used to schedule our lives to make sure we never missed an episode."
5,"As Ziva David, Tony Dinnozo, And Abby Have left the show, the show has become very lame and very uninteresting. Tony once said, ""We need the Pa. Now I know what He was referring to.All the PA's have left the show, and we are left with D- Characters. Basically kind of toward being a clear F in my opinion.The TV Show has lost it's spark, which is very sad. When the show first aired it had a freshness to it and I really liked it a lot (Actually gave it 8/10 Stars) Now I would only give it 4/10 Stars.We have decided not to continued to watch this in the following Season(s) to come.I wish the Characters well in the future Season(s)"
6,"When the show first started out it was a little shaky, but since then has grown into its own. The characters are believable, both annoying and enchanting, and the plots are wonderful. There's a depth and a comradeship that isn't often showed this well in television. It isn't forced or faked; it's entirely true to life and believable. The underlying sexual tension between several of the characters is also intriguing and interesting to watch, the most obvious of these being the relationship between Tony and Kate, but there's also hints at Kate and Gibbs, McGee and Abby, and so on. It's a crime drama that's both serious and light-hearted, and a wonderful show for anyone who likes fascinating stories, good humor, and great character interaction."
7,"Finally Bellisario got it right.  Gibbs and his gang are first and foremost investigators, not hoity-toity staff officers who moonlight as stereotyped combat soldiers with thickly-laid-on patriotic dogma that would make Ward Carroll vomit with rage.  At no time do they ever try to borrow an F-14 to go on some bombing raid over the international hot spot du semaine; they stick to their job descriptions the whole time.  They also have personalities and eccentricities that make them a better ridealong than overstarched Harmless Rabbit and whatever babe he happens to be working with this season, such as Gibbs' coffee addiction, Ducky's intellectual ramblings, DiNozzo's attempts at being a cool womanizer, Abby's interesting blend of science nerd and goth grrrl, and Kate as the token vaguely normal neophyte thrown into the mix.  Too bad this couldn't have been done with JAG in the first place."
8,"Tony Dinozzo (Michael Weatherly) was the character that really made this show come to life for me. He was interesting, a film buff and very unlike the typical gungho cop you get in shows like this. When he left (and I know there were characters leaving before him) it left a huge gap that the new stable of characters just can't fill. In fact there have been a few newbies come in since he left and they are all so boring I cannot even think of their first names. Now Abby has also left and so we really only have Jethro, Ducky and Probie left. Probie was always a supporting character a good straight man to Dinozzo. Jethro worked well with the original cast but now looks bored but happy to be raking in the cash. Ducky is still interesting but not on the show as often as he used to be. And the others? Who cares."
9,"I've been a fan since the beginning and have watched every episode but with all the changes in the last year or two, the show has lost what made it great. The relationships between Tony and Kate and then Tony and Ziva added something special. Tony's and Abbey's personalities made it even better but now there's just nothing. They took away what made the show great and didn't add anything to make up for it. It also seems that Mark Harmon is tired of the show and it shows in his acting. He doesn't have the gusto he used to. Unfortunately , NCIS has gone downhill, become boring to watch, and I may not continue to do so."
10,Not much left in the way of talent - The Tim character is now flat and uninspired- the Abbey replacement is more a cartoon character- and the scripts are uninspired- too bad - no longer interested in NCIS.
11,"I've written about this show before on IMDb --- but here I am months later in May 2005 and yet it still continues to be impressive. There have been a few shows that were ""bleh"" in the last season but the ""SWAK"" episode tonight really got a few great moments of emotion between the cast members. The writers (at least to me) were able to pull off the ""suspended disbelief"" and I got pulled into the moment as DiNozzo was about to kick the bucket. I sure hope they keep most of the cast in the next season, as they seem to play off each other brilliantly. The only cast member I could see losing (according to the season finale preview, they lose an NCIS agent) is McGee. He's great and believable for his role, but any of the others lost as regulars on the show would break down the core character interplay. The McGee character could be replaced...but the others would be much more difficult. But then again I guess this is all decided and in the can...we'll find out on May 24th. My comments to other viewers that have commented on the reality of the series --- yeah, it's not the real life NCIS at all. But real life would be mind-numbingly boring to fit in 60 minute TV show. You'd need the constant buzz of fluorescent lights in the background combined with pages and pages of forms being typed into the computer --- mostly about drug abuses by young 18 year olds. This is TV drama and a fabricated fiction. I appreciate the nod Bellesario gives to NCIS and like the show for the entertainment it is. Real life NCIS isn't a fun job, but we get an hour on Tuesday night to pretend it is."
12,"I knew she was coming as soon as I heard the character was leaving and Duckys assistant arrived. No thanks.It is a shame they killed off MI6 officer, now Im wondering if he will be replaced.I may just quit watching this now."
13,"Earlier seasons are very good, with a lot of strong, interesting characters, Todd, Ziva, Tony, Abby, Ducky, McGee, Gibbs, ... after so many main characters exited the show, they were replaced with extremely mediocre ones (Quinn, Sloane, Torres, or Jackson, etc.), the one replaced Abby was the worst. Don't bother watch the current season, it's simply garbage now."
14,"Don't get me wrong. I loved the seasons with Ziva, Tony and McGee. When Ziva quit, something happened, when Tony quit, it was over! I stopped watching the series short time after that. For some reason I watched a few episodes of season 15. This serial has become so lame, it is really unbelievable. From a franchise wich used to be fun, action and drama, we now just see lame attempts of a script trying to make people cry, laughing my ass off. The actors are so unconvincing and having actors crying on screen or looking like they are going to cry any minute doesn't make it more watchable, it is just annoying and painfull to watch, what a waste of time and resources. Still the best is putting Gibbs next to a child and have him smile, it's so creepy! Gibbs I think you made enough of money, stop it and invest in another project, not involving children or ctying actors, it is defenitly not your thing."
15,"Just finished binge watching Season 14 and I have watched this show since the beginning. Maybe the producers or whomever are trying to set a record for the length of the series, but there is little other reason for this show to continue. The exit of vital characters like Ziva & DiNozzo has created a downward slide into mis-casting key roles and creating dubious plots. The one bright spot in casting is Reeves, the MI6 transplant - both the actor and the character bring a breath of fresh air to the otherwise dowdy team. The loss of Vance's wife and Ziva's father was a preposterous plot twist. The addition of Quinn and Torres to fill the gaps in the NCIS team is weak and failing. Quinn has nothing to do and Torres doesn't belong there. Neither character is interesting nor entertaining in any way. Maybe, like Reeves, the producers should have considered another foreign import, French or Swedish?, to add some dimension. Bishop is marginally effective as an analyst, but is not believable as a field agent. It would have been better to keep her married and have her be the nerdy info bank who gathers and sorts backgrounds & personality profiles, even if it were a smaller role. That kind of role would be a fair replacement for the departing Abby, and Bishop's tricky relationship with her NSA lawyer-husband would have brought new fodder to episodes. And why do we have to be subjected to Jimmy Palmer's buffoonery in every episode, said buffoon scenes becoming longer with each passing season? I'm also now very tired of Franks showing up in a delusion to drive a story. Kind of pathetic. There is lots more I could say but basically it's time for this series to go out with some dignity left. I know the show has been slated for a 16th season but I can't imagine it getting any better if it stays on the same path."
16,"*SPOILERS NCIS* The NCIS (Navy Criminal Investigative Service) is a service that investigates on any kind of crime, from barroom brawls to international terrorism, that involves men and women from the Navy or Marine Corps.The team is formed by: Leroy Jethro Gibbs (the second B stays for Bastard) (Mark Harmon), the moody, intuitive head investigator; he likes his coffee very strong, his women with red hair, and his investigations thorough. It is rare to get a compliment for him; when you get one, don't ask why. He is very loyal, and actually cares for his team, but has problems with women (evidence of this being three failed weddings). Anthony DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly), Gibbs' 2IC; a smartmouth, player to the soul and proud of it, who masks his quick mind and powerful intuition with a happy-go-lucky (and sometimes obnoxious) attitude. Sometimes he can behave in quite the juvenile way, and when he is, a good headslap by Gibbs will help him put things straight (this two have also what could possibly be the strongest homosexual subtext - more of an almost-text - in TV History). He enjoys to torment someone, usually the newest element of the team. Dearly departed Special Agent Kate Todd (more later) and Special Agent Tim McGee (more later) have suffered the brunt of that in various occasions. Comes from money, but doesn't get an allowance because if he did, he wouldn't work, and it seems there is bad blood between him and his family. He has a deep love of movies and TV Shows (one of his favorites is 'Ozzy And Harriet'), and referred to movie-acquired knowledge various times.Kate Todd (Sasha Alexander), killed in the Season 2 Finale, who came from Secret Service, and made a point of bringing it up whenever the occasion presented itself, and came off as quite the uptight girl; all in all, the weakest character in the show, though her witty 'Hepburn-Tracy' rapid-fire dialogues with DiNozzo were great, and she had with him the strongest hetero almost-text this side of Gil Grissom and Catherine Willows.Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette) a perky Goth (not as oxymorous as it sounds) who has an imprecise number of tattoos on her body and is the greatest at her job. She loves to hear techno or hard rock music (like Android Lust) played at a very loud volume while working. She is the only person in the team Gibbs actually shows affection for, and she is currently dating Special Agent Tim McGee (more later).Tim McGee (Sean Murray), who joined the team in the second season after making various guest-appearances throughout the first season. Tim is a computer whiz, but is at a loss when it comes to social life; has gotten a tattoo on his butt to impress Sciuto - and it worked. Has been mercilessly teased by DiNozzo when he first joined the team, getting the absolutely-not-flattering nickname 'Probie' ('Pivello' ('Greenhorn') in the Italian Version). He has proved his valor, though, time and time again.And last but not least, Donald 'Ducky' Mallard (David McCallum), the ME, who has two curious habits; one, to talk to the corpses he is going to autopsy, and the other, to go off on tales that are very loosely related to the case in question. He likes the music Abby plays, but not distorted by speakers, lives with his mother, who, wearing only Chanel N°5 when she goes to bed, hosts very awkward slumber parties and has various dogs, he is the one who has worked the longest with Gibbs and looked like 'Ilya Kuryakin' when he was younger.This is the team (I'm not talking about Ziva and Madame Director because I have yet to see Season 3), and my suggestion is to watch them in action, every Tuesday, 8/7 central, on CBS.You won't be disappointed.NCIS: 9/10."
17,This is a great series to watch.  I have been hooked on this show since the beginning because I love watching mysteries and crime like CSI and CSI Miami.  Harmon's so sexy in this role and McCallum is always a joy to watch as Ducky especially when he's on the role over various anthropology lectures which to my amusement everyone on that shows roll up their eyeballs.
18,"(cue The Cranberries song ""Disappointment) The first episode I saw of NCIS was the one where the great (now late) Charles Durning played the Medal of Honor recipient, and I thought, ""wow, this is really good."" So my wife picked up the first 3 season on DVD at a garage sale (FIRST WARNING!) so I sat down to watch.Wait a minute, I thought, this isn't NCIS, the thoughtful touching program I watched a few weeks ago. It was more like 90210 or ""Welcome Back, Kotter"" with the juvenile characters than a professional organization like SVU or CSI like I was used to watching. I'm not getting into details; this show is now 11 years old and well known. What I am amazed at is how people on the board go on and on about the same negative things that I picked up on as early as the first season and were glaring by the end of the third. I suppose they keep on with the series for the same reason you go on with a wife or husband you've been married to for 20 years: You remember when it was good and pray that somehow life (the show) will get back to that.One thing more. I really wanted to like this show, really. I like cop shows, I like tight teams and good stories. IMO this is nothing more than a cop-based soap opera featuring the saga of Mossadu Barbie and Jethro Bodine... I mean Gibbs. I come back every now and again hoping it's better, but it's been a waste of my time. 6*** for the cast, 1* for everything else about it."
19,"Am I the only one thinks that Season 14 is lacking something N.C.I.S. used to have? I am kind of disappointed with this season. Sure, I watch each and every episode and look forward to the next, but; somehow or other, the action seems to revolve less about homicides and N.C.I.S. purpose and more on the personal relationships of its members. Furthermore, the cases that N.C.I.S. got this whole season seem to be very lame compared to the cases from previous seasons. I am writing this because I noticed that while watching the episodes of this season, if I get a phone call, I pause the recording to answer the phone, while in the past, I would let the call go to voicemail so as not to interrupt my watching. I feel that the departures of Cote de Pablo, first, followed by Michael Weatherly took something from the show and that whatever was lost has not yet been replaced. Ducky has fewer lines while Palmer seems to get more attention and is just as funny. Abby is Abby and McGee is not as prominent as before. In my opinion, I feel that the writers seem to also have lost their touch.This really saddens me because last year, I bought the DVD's for all the seasons which I had missed, and I remember binge-watching them like there was no tomorrow. Let's just hope that things pick up for the next couple of episodes or for next season."
20,"I am very disappointed with this season's cast changes. I have been a loyal fan of NCIS from the very beginning. I've always enjoyed the show and thought the writing was great and the characters were believable. But Jennifer Esposito has all but ruined the show for me. I find her to be rude, arrogant, obtrusive and obnoxious. She definitely Does Not fit in with the team! Wilmer Valderrama may eventually fit in, once he learns that he is there to work, not to flirt with every skirt on the show and search for apartments while he is supposed to be working a crime scene! Also, the writing has taken a decided turn for the worse - the character's parts are all over the place, and it seems they have no idea what they are doing with Jimmy Palmer this season. The show used to be balanced, told a good story, and treated all of the characters well. Now it seems they have lost their way caring more about jumping on the politically correct, diversity, and inclusive bandwagon than with creating the award winning show they have had for all these years. Very sad to see such a great show fall apart like this :-("
21,"Same old stories over and over. Gibbs is way to old, they would not have a man of his years in the lead, it's farcical.Ncis Los Angeles is much better escapism."
22,I have watched every episode but the new abby replacement stinks. Hope they find a better replacement soon.
23,"Season 17 started with a bang with Ziva making a 2 episode return. Now she has gone and with her any talented script writers.
It has now returned to the smaltzy dribble it has been since Ziva left.
If you like this sort of thing watch The Waltons . This is now a program this is long past its best. I guess all the time it makes money it will run. Oh for the days of Tony, Abby, Kate and Ziva..........."
24,What started out as an amazing series for many years has declined over the past few and had unfortunately become something rather senile. Occasionally serious with a lot of something which appears to try to imitate humor but greatly lacks it and sadly the wit is gone
25,"A friend of mine describes the cast of characters in this show as ""a delightfully dysfunctional family."" I certainly will agree that they are dysfunctional. Delightful? Not so much.This is a crime show in a period where crime shows are all the rage, so the formula is a familiar one: a crime - usually, but not always, murder - is discovered at the beginning of the show, and the cast are the people who solve the crime. The main difference is that these crimes take place in the military, so the crime solvers aren't detectives, but agents. Leading our intrepid pack is Agent Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon), ""the best agent ever,"" according to director, Jenny Shepard (Lauren Holly). The rest of the team consists of Agent Tony DiNozzo (Michael Wetherley), whose last name fittingly rhymes with ""Bozo,"" Agent Timothy McGee (Sean Murray), who seems to perpetually be the unrespected ""probie,"" and Agent Kate Todd (Sasha Alexander), who died at the end of season 2, and was replaced by Israeli Ziva David (Cote de Pablo), who, despite having been in the USA for many years, still doesn't seem to get American cultural references. They are assisted by Dr. Donald Mallard (David McCollum), incongruously called ""Ducky,"" and Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette), arguably the brains of the outfit, although her area of expertise is never specified. Somehow this rather offbeat and bumbling combination manages to solve the crime every week, and successfully sees that the guilty party faces the proper authorities.The writing of this show is an odd mixture in that they do manage to come up with some intriguing scenarios, but have created some of the most unlikable characters I've ever encountered. Gibbs seems to rely on little else besides an arrogant stare and hitting his team members upside the back of the head to solve crimes. DiNozzo takes cluelessness to levels that really ought to get him thrown out of the Navy. Ziva covers her inability to get American culture with an attitude of superiority that is wearing. Ducky is a little too eager to describe the results of his autopsies in gory detail - with visual aids. And Abby really leaves me wondering how she manages to exist outside the confines of an institution. The only one I find to be both smart and likable is McGee, and nobody listens to him. Their efforts to solve crimes often come across as bumbling as the Keystone cops, and I'm left wondering how this is supposed to be representative of the Navy's finest.Given that the characterizations are so unpleasant, it's hard to know how much of that is the fault of the writing, and how much of the actors themselves. Since the characterizations are so consistent from week to week (perhaps a little too consistent, since in some cases they show no growth at all), I'm inclined to say that the actors are doing a good job with limited material. Frankly, they could all benefit from a chance to stretch a bit with their characters, and I think they're all easily up to the challenge.While I think the idea of showing us how the Navy deals with crimes that take place among its members is a good premise, I really don't care for the artistic choices made in bringing this show to life. In short, these aren't people that I want to invest an hour of my time watching, and the only way I'd ever enjoy the show is if somebody hit Gibbs upside the back of the head - repeatedly. Still, clearly, I'm in the minority, and it looks like this ""delightfully dysfunctional family"" will be around for awhile solving crimes and entertaining the masses. Enjoy, everybody!"
26,I mute her when she comes on! Can't stand her acting. She tries to hard. Saw her on 2 broke girls and she was the same. Wasn't there anyone else for the position? We need more Deliah!
27,"There is simply nothing about NCIS that is not to like. I'll get the superficial stuff out of the way first - every camera angle on Michael Weatherly is gorgeous, and he plays it so well as Anthony DiNozzo. Ziva, his partner, is most adorable with every cultural nuance she utters as she tries to grasp American idioms. It's charming and realistic. Her ability to speak Israeli for some plot lines truly adds to her beauty and character-balancing the serious with the humorous sides of the show. Bringing David McCallum into our lives again brings the emotion of nostalgia. How we loved his British accent in THE MAN FOR U.N.C.L.E. His charming ramblings, his sensitivity to forensics, and his educational lessons are perfect. Characters McGee and Abby play perfectly off each other. and Mark Harmon is the guiding treasure. Tie up in a bow, and they have all played their characters so convincingly that we are invited to be part of their team every week. That's true TV. The bonus: no foul language, machine guns blaring, and no sex (but plenty of engaging innuendos). Please tune in. This show is such a delight."
28,"I've been watching NCIS since it started and have been a regular viewer since the debut. The first reason I tuned in was simple - Mark Harmon. Second reason was, well, Michael Weatherly. David McCallum was just a really nice bonus. That being said ... I know that NCIS as it is shown on the screen is ludicrous, so is CSI and all its off shoots, but if you show what really happens in any investigation you'll chase off the audience with boredom.Mark Harmon has brought a sense of realism to the Leroy Jethro Gibbs character to the point that my former active duty Marine husband swears up and down that Harmon MUST have been a Gunny in real life. Either this one or a previous one, he's just too good playing a senior NCO Reservist Marine and a cop. Gibbs is also a top-notch ""Training Officer"" who clearly trains all of his people to be able to step up and take control and command of a team in a moment's notice.Michael Weatherly has matured as an actor - I first noticed him in Dark Angel - and he has wisely chosen to let his character on the show, Anthony ""Tony"" DiNozzo, to mature at a natural rate. Slowly. He's gone from an annoying frat-like not-quite-mature man to a deep thinker and a MUCH better investigator who can handle deep cover assignments if needed. Maybe not as well Gibbs could handle it, but that sort of skill takes time and multiple assignments to be fully qualified (and by then, the Feds tend to ship you off to their Academies so you can teach what you've learned).Cote de Pablo (Mossad Officer Ziva David) replaced Sasha Alexander (Caitlin ""Kate"" Todd) and I'm probably in the minority when I say ""THANK YOU"" to the casting department for that. I found Todd to be a rather flat, and annoying, character. Oh she had a few lines here and there that were light hearted and worth a giggle - usually at DiNozzo's expense - but for the most part she was played a little too 'boy next door, or trying to be' by Alexander. Cote, at least, has played Ziva as a very capable, and very female, Intelligence Officer. I think this is why most folks don't like Ziva, they expect a Law Enforcement officer type character but she's an Intelligence Agent. Think CIA and kick it up several notches - you don't mess with Mossad unless you have a death wish. Cote clearly realizes this and plays ""Officer David"" with that in mind.David McCallum, Doctor Donald ""Ducky"" Mallard, is always a joy to see on the screen and I love the 'quirks' David has given Ducky. I suspect there is a history behind Ducky's 'adventure stories' that could easily fill several books - and be considered too implausible to be anything but fiction. Ducky brings a human element to the position of Medical Examiner, a warmth that civilians don't think M.E.'s have but usually do. The ones I know also have wicked, if dry, senses of humor and McCallum has joyfully taken the humor route with Ducky and I, for one, appreciate it.Another quirky character is, of course, Pauley Perrett's Abby Scuitto, Goth Forensic Scientist. Her portrayal of Abby is spot on as Pauley is the only person I've heard of playing a Criminal Scientist who actually has the sheepskin in the discipline. Nothing like a touch of realism to bring a character to life! Of course, people complain that Scuitto shouldn't be permitted to work in a federal job with the obvious life style she has - to you I say, HorseFeathers. If Abby were less capable at her job, she wouldn't be there as long as she has been. Nor would any of her supervisors put up with her oddities.Now to speak of the other ""Geek"" on the team - Timothy McGee. Techno-geek. Keyboard Wizard. Sean Murray needs to do only one thing to make me totally happy with his character and his protrayl of McGee-cut his hair! I realize that the McGee character has a life outside of NCIS - as a published novelist no less - and probably keep his hair on the long side to emphasize his Authorial Air but... I hate the way it's flopped in his face this past season.The writing on this show, like others, is usually tight but like other shows there are episodes where the writing was clearly 'off' when the idea was dreamt up or the script approved. The fact that the cast can take a lousy script and still get a watchable show out of it, is nothing short of amazing. Is NCIS accurate? No. Is NCIS a good way to learn about the Marine Corps or the Navy? Uh, no. Better talk to a recruiter if you're thinking of joining the military. Is NCIS good fun? YEAP!"
29,"The character Abby is great and funny...  She makes the whole show as far as I am concerned.  I just wish she was more of a main character and they had her onscreen more...  This is the first show where a Goth type character is shown as something more than some wierdo to be avoided.  I wish more shows would do the same.  The rest of the cast is ok...and the show has its moments.  Not quite as intense as the other CIS shows but maybe that's why I like it.  While the other shows seem so serious, NCIS adds humor (especially as mentioned above with the Goth Abby) which makes it great.  David McCallum is an excellant actor and helps to make the show with his ""Semi-absent minded professor"" style where he seems to get off on tangents while explaining things.  I hope they keep this show on the air...it is one of my favorites."
30,"Being a big Dark Angel fan (at least a Season One Dark Angel fan), my main reason for watching NCIS originally was Michael Weatherly. Seeing how he could play someone so different from Logan Cale was fascinating for me. That fact that Mark Harmon (whom I've always enjoyed watching)and David McCallum (fan of the Shaphire and Steel program)were also in the program was a bonus. My sister in law is a Mark Harmon fan, so she got something out of the program and everybody (my father included) loves Abby. This is a program that everyone in the family can get something out of. The occasional Dark Angel reference thrown in adds to my fun. (i.e William Gregory Lee who played Zack in Dark Angel was a guest star and was the actor who played Logan's Uncle Jonas)"
31,"Oh, what an engaging show this used to be... I still remember episodes from more than a decade ago with Sasha Alexander. Ziva was a solid replacement, ably supported by Tony and Ducky. Gibbs was a no-nonsense, high-and-tight Marine. There was action, there was intrigue, there was natural humor, there were genuinely poignant moments even during the slower, more personal scenes. Those moments were moving because they felt real and because they involved characters we cared about.The past couple of years have upturned almost all of that. Almost all the core personalities are gone. Those still there (Gibbs, McGee, and--occasionally--Ducky) have been emasculated to the point where you begin wondering if McGee and Jimmy are going to start making out during one of their heart-to-hearts. Gibbs is becoming more of a senile grandpa with each episode. Other characters have come and gone: the gorgeous Jennifer Esposito, the black English dude, McGee's disabled wife... As for the shrink (Jack) and the new Abby (a.k.a. a female Steve Urkel), the less said the better. Torres and Bishop are okay but they're never going to fill the shoes of Ziva David and Anthony DiNozzo. I think the only character worth his salt anymore is Director Vance.Then there's the storylines and plots. The show has taken on a distinctly politically-correct tone. Seasons 16 has so far managed to dredge up racism form the 1960s as well as feature sermonizing about the environment... - and that's just two episodes! It's now a hybrid of the Gilmore Girls, Lethal Weapon, and Dr. Phil.It pains me to say it but this show is well past its sell-by date. It's time to put it out of its misery. May this season (#16) be the last so the show is retired with _some_ (albeit not much) dignity left..."
32,"As a prior Marine, I know what NCIS actually does, and chasing terrorists through the streets of Washington DC is not it. If they were trying to make this a serious show, they failed horribly. I gave the show a chance because I was intrigued by the two part JAG episode in which it was introduced, but on it's own it fails to hold water. It basically became ""how can we make JAG more like CSI?"" Half the time they are investigating crimes that would be under FBI jurisdiction (notibly terrorism). The absolute worst part is the characters which are so stereotypical and one-dimensional:You got your hard ass burnout-cop leader (Gibbs). Your chauvinistic frat boy (DiNozzo). Your sexy but-I'm-still-tough token female agent (Todd, now Ziva). Your lost-in-the-sauce FNG (McGee). Your techie nerd (Abby).On the plus side, I have to admit I like Ducky. He's pretty cool. If only they could write his character off the show and move him to CSI.Those like me who are familiar with the military will probably not like this show. Everyone else will (apparently) love it."
33,"I used to thoroughly enjoy this series, but with Ziva and Tony gone and Abby apparently about to leave, it has gone right down in my estimation. The three new cast members are very poor substitutes for the above, the two females (especially the dark one) being the most annoying. One feels no empathy towards them, and they seem unlikely characters to exist in an organisation such as NCIS. Has the USA gone to same way as the UK in being unable to produce decent TV series (or films) any longer? Guess I'll just have to stick to watching older stuff on DVD.What a shame."
34,"The cast is headed by beloved Hollywood television star, Mark Harmon, who doesn't have an Emmy or A Golden Globe Award. Harmon richly deserves those accolades and more. He is one of the main reasons that NCIS has remained a beloved television series with high ratings for the last decade. The other cast members like Pauley Perrette, Michael Weatherly, and Sasha Alexander are team players. Scottish American actor, David McCallum, should also be honored with a British Honour for acting here. It's a shame that this show doesn't get the accolades and awards like other shows. The writing is consistent and strong. The cast is first rate. It's as entertaining and enlightening to watch. Still going strong after 13 seasons and the highest rated drama on television for years."
35,"I became a fast fan of NCIS for a number of reasons, all of which continue to grow and improve. While the time-worn stereotypical gender jokes and undercurrents are fully present, NCIS writers and actors give them the authenticity of today's real life (not some phony politically-correct representation) and the wit and timing of classic Preston Sturgess, where ultimately, it is the verbal and visual language between the characters that is the playing field, and scoring has more to do with penetrating facades and eliciting accidental truths or witnessing personal honor. The actor playing Tony is blessed with good looks, no doubt, but like Bellasarius' earlier Hunk (do they still call them ""hunks""?) Magnum, is an absolute master of the material so much so, that it is Tony who sets our emotions up in a scene - that casual, unmoved, disconnected swagger - our eyes on the more seemingly 'serious' acting of newcomer Ziva (only one step behind Oprah for the current female role model)and regulars Abby, Probie, Madame Director, Duckie (and sidekick) and Jethro. As an ensemble cast, they are as powerfully entertaining and absorbing as any in TV history. My family enjoys the story lines each week, and watch with interest the mysteries and intrigues that develop. But it is the characters, their relationships with each other, themselves, and the issues that confront them that makes us true fans. The paradoxes of rigid military protocols and impossible rules, might and powerlessness, fraternity and isolation, conscience and commitment, and the all-time biggie, honor, are continually probed, tickled, and sometimes exploded. As seamlessly easy a watch NCIS can appear, it can also stir its viewer - where long after the episode's entertainment is concluded, the questions or conflicts it visited have unpacked their bags in our psyches. Tune in. Relax. And don't let the overtly sexual innuendo or scantily clad cameos (usually female) turn you off. NCIS offers strong feminism, macho-ism, patriotism, and humanitarianism, intrigue and connumdrum. Cudos to the team that gets it right and plays it true - all can and must coexist."
36,"I watch this show almost everyday on reruns because people in my family like it, and I must say that I don't know why. Almost everything about this show is cheesy, lame, repetitive and poorly thought out. The dialog is sub par at best. It seems like everyone likes the characters and I have not the slightest idea why. The only one one who is half decent is Dinozzo simply because he has no special character traits. Everyone else is a stereotype of a character that has been done to death in a million other shows. I just find that basically none of the characters interact well with one another. It is as if they took the main characters from their own shows and dropped them all together in NCIS. The result is that they are all too unique to create any kind of cohesion. Maybe once a show Dinozzo and Gibbs have a funny sequence of lines but every other time it is not funny and usually nonsensical, defying the way any humans would interact with each other. Not to mention countless instances of assault on the part of Gibbs towards his team, and the team in general towards suspects,terrorists etc. It all adds to the stupidity and unbelievability. So I guess I will continue tuning in because I am forced to... I wonder what the story will be next time? My money says that, wait let me guess, a member of the navy.... is murdered!!!!! Anyone wanna take that bet?"
37,"NCIS is a skillful balance of humor and serious drama. None of the major characters is static, i.e. there is depth. Every week, we discover more about the characters, who they are, where they are coming from, why they do what they do. But the show does not sacrifice the plot for the sake of the characters. Stories are well thought-out and believable. The cast is superb, with Mark Harman leading the ensemble. What a complex character, that Leroy Jethro Gibbs! At first, I did not like Tony; I thought he was an ego-centric, male chauvinist pig, but there's more in there than the id-controlled Mr. DiNozzo, I'm discovering. Then there's Abby--I just adore Abby! The mix of scientist, alternative lifestyle, street smarts and just a touch of naiveté. Tim McGee started out like a puppy, willing to please. Well, that puppy's growing up, folks, and watch out! The two new characters, Ziva & Jenn are intriguing as well. I love the sexual tension between the director and Gibbs. And Ziva is more than a match for Tony. The vulnerability we saw in Hiatus was great, too. And Ducky: I save him for last for many reasons. A David McCallum fan for more years than I care to numerate, I can easily say that this is probably his best role (Colditz was his second best--check it out if you can).All in all, I look forward to the 4th season to show the same excellence of craft as the last three have accomplished."
38,"It was bad enough that over the last two years the story line has dropped off. My enthusiasm for the show has dropped as well. But the replacement for Abby was the reason I now do not watch the show. She is trying to be the same and is failing.
Time to bite the bullet and bring Abby back before the show gets cancelled."
39,"I know I can't be the only person out there that sees through this show's god-awful cheesiness! For crying out loud every character is completely unoriginal cop cliché: an old bitter chauvinist leader, an asshat trigger-happy tough guy, a noobish rookie, a jaded female cop always trying to show that she's man enough for the job, and nerdy techie that knows everything, yet manages to remain 'cool' at the same time. Every episode begins with Gibbs saying ""We've got a dead Marine!"" and ends with the team stopping Al-Quada's latest plot to blow up Washington DC. If you can get around the obnoxious character and episode clichés then there is still the element of realism: real NCIS agents don't hunt terrorists in (US) city streets. At least 97% of the events that happens in this show are things they would never be involved in at all in real life.But who am I kidding, mindless patriotic action shows are the hot thing these days, and people eat it up like hungry pigs."
40,"I've enjoyed NCIS ever since it first came on British tv. The mix of action, humour and pathos just seemed to work with NCIS,which was lacking with the CSI shows.
Saying that, NCiS LA and NCIS NO left me cold as well.
We are now up to Season 14 on British tv and I think it has lost its way. Apart from McGee and Gibbs the agents don't really seem to fit and I couldn't care less if they were blown away.
I know that shows develop and change through each season but losing Cote de Pablo and Michael Whetherly changed everything. Talking of Cote I'd like to know whether she was cold shouldered after she left because she has done nothing worthwhile since. If so that was mean and spiteful."
41,"These story lines USED to be about Naval personnel and the problems they encountered---with the NCIS Team helping resolve them.Anymore, most of these programs are about the ""personnel interactions"" between team members. For example, Tony and Ziva: for weeks and weeks, he has been trying to get her back from Israel and get her to love him. This has become so tiresome...tiresome...tiresome.And Gibbs storyline involving shooting down some of his own friends is to far out of his to-date character line that it is amost comical, to say the least.Please, Writers, whatever you do, please get OFF this track. You are losing fans!"
42,"Today, the TV is fulled with stuff, you can find almost everything. And if crime is what you 're looking for, CSI Miami or CSI NY are the average answers. Why? Very easy: American government, then American people, then American nation wants to see themselves like Superman all the time. That's why we see Gary Sinsie breaking a terrorist, David Carusso putting his sunglasses and shaking the hand of his Mexican friend, who in the next episode, he may kill, after doing what they call ""justice"" OK, ladies and germs: for those that think that crime and justice are so easy words, I'm sorry to tell you: You're wrong. Crime is not that easy. And, as I said before, the TV is fulled. So, we also have the ""true crime"" shows like Criminal Minds, Law And Order CI and SVU, Withouth a Trace and many more. In Law And Order CI, they usually focus on the victims, with very strong and dense cases, but someone wonders: ""What about the investigator itself? Does it have to be danger danger all the time or can you have some fun?"" If that is your question, NCIS is one of your main answers. NCIS comes from Donald P. Bellisario, the creator of the well-known series JAG. He was also a writer of several Magnum P.1 episodes. NCIS is, more than just forensics, it's a character show. It's the story of the in and out relationships of the investigators and scientists of an agency that does anything criminal tied up to the marines, thing that Bellisario liked to do also in JAG. Therefore, we can find humor, drama, love, tragedy, and some bits of US action, besides of one of the most unusual characters you can find on such genre: an 50's former marine is the leader, a goth forensics and an 86 years old Scotish M.E that talks to his corpses. If we do a season analysis on the show, we can conclude that, it has been rising to good. The first season was a bit of CSI style, everyone was just cool. But it already had the trademark humor and a good ending. Season 2 could have initially been the same case, but the end was totally surprising. Season 3 was a very ruff one, were mistakes and chance are all the time, 4 was just human, and 5... Well, 5 has not shown up yet down here at Mexico, but I have heard that is good. NCIS is, in summary: Human 10/10 GREAT CAST GREAT CHARACTERS GREAT HUMOR GREAT..."
43,"Recently sat through a virtual marathon of episodes from various seasons and came away disappointed and disbelieving. This show seems to have devolved to the low levels first achieved with ""24"" showing government agents doing bad things for good reasons. Suspects/witnesses are routinely subjected to insults, lies and in many instances physical abuse to achieve ends. Superiors, agents of similar agencies and other services as well as local law enforcement are routinely treated with ill-disguised contempt if not outright disdain.It is doubtful that any of the cases ""solved"" by this group would get by a grand jury let alone result in conviction in a full blown trial, given their intimidation tactics and routine lack of warrants for searches. In one episode, David, the Israeli Mossad agent, is left alone to physically torture a female office employee with the knowing consent of her boss, Gibbs. In another, she kicks a handcuffed male suspect in the groin. In other episodes, Gibbs and his fellow agents lie to and threaten American citizens and legally resident aliens with indefinite detention in Guantanamo.Some may find this kind of show wishfully entertaining. One can only hope that it is not taken by foreign audiences as realistically representative of the U.S. legal system."
44,"Always being an avid follower of this series. For last three years I've not been keeping up with the show but covid-19 has freed up social time and gave me a chance to pick up where I left off and, whilst I played catch up, my curiosity got the better of me and I tuned into a couple the later end of season 17 episodes which was for me personally a bit of a mistake. I didn't want to respire to doing a search to find out what had happened to some of the characters but after two episodes of season 17 I felt compelled to do so.That said, it was a great relief to see David McCallum ironically re-appear in episode 17 of the very same series. He is and always will be a personal favourite though I do wonder why two of the main characters are still present as, personally, the ones that have moved on to pastures new over the years would, I feel be better placed if they returned to the show obviously Ziva being one of the characters that led me to tune into season 17 before Continuing to play catch up...yup as much as I really enjoy David McCallum's acting - I think after seeing him and Joanna Lumley teamed up was influential to my lifelong admiration - I equally miss seeing Abbi and Ziva in this show.I speak candidly when I say, from a personal, perspective, I like the team dynamics portrayed on screen are great, my own concern is that as the show continues you don't get the enjoyment of watching the likes of jethro et al. reach maturity in terms of career development and inevitable natural retirement of of such characters that could always return occasionally through guest appearance spots or one-off storylines where they are recalled when a -ast incident has resulted in shedding light on new material that questions whether a decision made in day season 1 or season 6 leads to a reviewing cases that, with technological advancements etc has broadened policy operations....science is ever evolving so learning from that has been a key factor to episodes where this has taken place with previous episodes following that format so given 17 seasons have played out, wouldn't it be interesting to see the team and its members and their roles evolve accordingly to reflect the shows ability to encapsulate a show that does through its portrayal of characters offer a mirroring of real life reality via this fictitious, yet entrancing tv show? It would entice me to continue to find the show compelling viewing ...that said, I'm just one of many followers of the show and my viewpoint could be an outlier and findings might indicate, in contrast, the mass of viewers opt for a preference to adopt the..if it ain't broke, don't try to fix it....approach to this series. Either way, I'm still watching, less curious, less intrigued, less avid a fan but still a fan nonetheless....wow, ramble much...better get back to catching up on previously missed episodes...less ramble and more viewing would, for me, be more productive eh lol."
45,"Tuesday evenings are always reserved on my calendar for NCIS and I'm never disappointed. Mark Harmon as ""Gibbs"" is outstanding."
46,"First off, I have to agree with a minority of other reviewers who describe the show's characters as stereotypical and irritating. Secondly, NCIS are detectives, who investigate crimes usually taking place on Navy jurisdiction, or sometimes involving high-profile Naval personnel. They are not a combination of the FBI or the CIA. They do not conduct counter-terrorism operations or any overseas covert ops. They do not run off to the hills of W. Virginia to find out why a Marine on leave fell of a cliff. They do not work out of a headquarters with an electronics array and lab resembling something out of a sci-fi set. They do not drive at break-neck speed without being stopped by local police. They are not at odds with all other law enforcement agencies, and are definitely not superior to any of them. It is not considered inferior duty to be assigned to a regional office or aboard a ship. In short, NCIS is an agency of competent investigators who perform their jobs with the same resources as most other agencies. They are portrayed on TV with a lot of artistic license."
47,"I really enjoyed this show for a long time, but for the last few seasons it has become unwatchable.I loved DiNozzo, don´t enjoy Torres, at all. I loved Abby, Kasie not so much. And now even Gibbs is drifting into a really bad direction. The scripts have become unbearable and some of the dialogues and acting are awful. I give it 5 stars, because I enjoyed it for quite a while."
48,"Remember when ncis was good ?
Wel now it isnt anymore
Everyone who made the show good left and now abby left the show went from rise to fall"
49,"It went downhill after they killed Ziva.. then Anthony left..
But when they replaced Abby with a similar character named Kasie I really started to hate it...
Gave it a 7 because I used to love it."
50,Bringing Zeva back with a plot that sounds like it is from a B movie (some mysterious group chasing het for years) - wow - really bad writing. It is such a shame to see such a great show go down the tubes! So sad
51,"Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon , 354 episodes) is the leader of a team of special agents belonging to the NCIS (Naval Criminal Investigative Service) Major Case Response Team , forced to execute risked assignments . Gibbs, is a former Marine, who carries out his cases with extreme intelligence and effectiveness . Gibbs' second in command is Senior Field Agent DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly , 306 episodes) who despite being a real joker , and a womanizer he is an efficient agent and he often tells cinema trivia . The team also consists of agent Ziva David (Cote De Pablo who made192 episodes) as an ex-Mossad agent and expert fighter , as well as the rookie Timothy McGee (Sean Murray , 339 episodes ) , he usually suffers the heavy jokes from DiNozzo . Assisting them are Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette) , the energetic-but-Goth laboratory tech who is like a daughter to Gibbs and is famously quoted as saying ""mike hunt won't stop bleeding!!"", and Dr. Donald Mallard, nicknamed Ducky, the eccentric Coroner who usually tells uncommon and strange tales . This team of elite agents is based in Washington, D.C. 
This is a professional group ¨the Naval Criminal Investigative Service's Washington DC Major Case Response Team¨ led by the veteran special agent Jethro Gibbs as leader of the expert squad , he carries out their missions resolving criminal cases and involving Marine and Navy personnel and their families, sometimes traveling the United States o around the world to do it . It is a successful TV series well produced including huge doses of humor , noisy action , technological developing , thrills and turns ; being starred by a motley , dynamic , complex , and highly qualified bunch of criminal investigation . 
Mark Harmon give a nice acting as a two-fisted and tough investigator and a highly skilled interrogator who relies on his gut instinct as much as evidence. The likeable Michael Weatherly plays as Tony DiNozzo, a womanizing, movie-quoting former Baltimore Homicide Detective, he is the class clown ,but he always gets the job well done . Sympathetic by goofy Sean Murray plays as as Junior Field Agent Timothy McGee , a computer-savvy agent often mocked by DiNozzo . Another role is the probationary field agent Eleanor Bisbop , a former NSA agent as well , and married to another agent , played by Jamie Bamber ; she is well interpreted by Emily Wickersham . Of course , the British veteran David McCallum plays medical examiner who explains his speaches while making autopsias , full of unusual stories and philosophical teories . And other chief called Leon Vance , nicely performed by Rocky Carroll who made 246 episodes , Lauren Holly as chief Jenny Shepard played 70 episodes , Sasha Alexander as agent Caitlin Todd playing 52 episodes, , among others .The series was well produced by Gil Grant , Donald P Bellisario, George Schenk , Steven Binder , Avery Drewe and several others . Being its main creator and producer ¨Donald P Bellisario¨ who has a long career creating and financing TV series , such as : Kojak , Galactica , Airwolf , Magnum PI , Tequila and Bonetti , Quantum Leap , and JAG"
52,"This show has been a ""10"" for years, but after a lackluster Season 14, it's clear Michael Weatherly's Anthony DiNozzo was a linchpin of the show. And I never thought I'd say it, but I miss Ziva David?! Gibbs is still Gibbs, but Mark Harmon seems to be going through the motions. Only Pauley Perrette and David McCallum are still firing on all cylinders.Newcomers Torres and Quinn (I can't even think of their first names offhand) are terrible. I'm not sure where they found Jennifer Esposito, but the producers should get their money back - her ""acting"" is uninspired at best, stilted and pedestrian at worst. Good thing she is leaving the cast. Wilmer Valderrama isn't much better, but he does seem to be improving. Clayton Reeves is a welcome relief, but the scripts aren't letting him breathe.One more season like this and NCIS will go out with a whimper, much like ER did nearly 10 years ago (after a strikingly similar 15 seasons). Perhaps Maria Bello - who was inspiring as Lucy Robbins in ""Touch"" - can reinvigorate the cast!"
53,"Okay I'll make it short : this show has good potential, could have been a major TV Success, but as it starts with the main theme, you immediately know what's up....some cheap synthetic piano track, with no mood and no spirit, that compared to this even Charlie Harper's jingles sound better...! PLUS, how the hell can you be as arrogant as the Gibbs character..?! I mean, who the hell does he think he is, some kinda God or something ? by hitting his employees behind the head and directing orders the way he does...The guy pisses off after 10minutes of watching, THIS IS NOT FUNNY ! I wouldn't even show this series to my kid, being afraid he'd have a wrong opinion of respect and human behavior..."
54,"I actually like this show and have watched it on and off again since it started but I just can't stand the character of Abby. I know she's supposed to come off as pretentious or something but she really annoys the ever loving fork out of people. I need to turn the station ever time I see her on the screen even if I'm sacrificing some of the plot. Her stupid looking pig tails and emo/goth look don't even match her personality. She's way too bubble headed to pull off that look which makes it seriously out of context. Also the Japanese Hooker pig tails makes her look look like she's trying way too hard to be a total and utter HIPSTER! I just want to see someone cut off her pigtails. Also I think that this show is awesome without her. But when they put her on it's like they put on a clown show all of a sudden. That she should be partners with Crusty the Clown or something. It totally breaks the 4th wall with this series. I usually don't like your common garden variety detective shows that network TV seems to have an OCD over so I understand they try to shake things up a bit with colorful characters. But watching Abby with her obvious ""Attention W#@r3"" attitude and dress makes me want to vomit. Also like I said she can't pull off that confused Emo meets Goth look with that 1980s shallow Valley Girl attitude. It's like watching an obnoxious train wreck. I actually want to give this show a solid 10 stars but can only give it 4. And in fact if this was only a 5 star rating system I'd have to give it a 2 stars simply for the fact that Abby is stupid. Even if she's supposed to be some genius she can not pull it off. She's pretentious, annoying, obnoxious, and a CLOWN! Also it's very very very CREEPY to watch an older woman in her 40's trying desperately to act like a bubbly 20 year old girl. It's just way creepy and disturbing to watch. Sort of like watching that old movie ""What ever happened to baby Jane"". ha ha ha Sorry to rant so much about this one character but I think she's been pulling this show down in the rating since the get go, she's been holding them back since the start. They need to fire her and replace her with someone people would like to see more. and not try so desperately to get attention by creating such an annoying out of context character."
55,"This show used to be in my top 5 must not miss shows every week until season 14. I honestly don't know what they were thinking when they forced Bishop & Kasie on us. Those 2 have ruined the show for me. I can tolerate the other 2 newbies, Torres & Sloane, to a point, but they too aren't the best fit either. It was great to bring back Ziva this season as an attempt to keep us interested, but it's a little too late because the damage has already been done the last few seasons. I can no longer watch without cringing every time Bishop & Kasie are on the screen because they just don't belong on this show. So many other loyal fans have said the same things & it amazes me they haven't replaced these horrible characters yet, but maybe the plan is to end the show, so they figure why bother writing in better characters. Anyway, I just want to say how much I truly enjoyed every season up to 13. I put up with most of season 14 only because I love Jennifer Esposito & wanted to see where that was going, but the minute they forced that out of nowhere relationship Bishop had onto us & then had her go all crazy & murder that guy it made me sick to my stomach to watch after that. I actually forced myself to keep watching just because I kept thinking things would change & that maybe Bishop would get fired for what she did or get demoted, since that's what it seemed was going to happen, except nothing happened. I guess the writers just gave up trying after that. I finally stopped watching it weekly after Kasie joined the team, though because she's the absolute worst fit of any character that's ever been on the show & I just couldn't stomach watching it after that. Last month I went back to try & catch up before this new season started by trying to skip through the parts when she came on & parts where it was just Bishop, too, but it's just not worth the trouble, so I am officially done watching for good now. It's such a shame how they made it so many seasons picking good characters that fit well with each other & with Gibbs, but then they just stopped trying after season 13. Thanks for 13 great seasons at least."
56,Still a favorite series to catch up on over a weekend - so I'm a few seasons behind. Who's this blond girl? And they've KEPT her on the show? She's so weak compared to the others - not the tough chick they try so hard to make her out to be. I just finished the episodes where she's getting divorced and had to fast forward through her scenes because they were so awful. The baby voice with a little sigh at the end of each sentence - excruciating. She has beaten out my other least favorite character - the silly moron Jimmy Palmer in the morgue.
57,"I love the show, and my friends like it too. We speak other languages, and we are very surprised, however, why NCIS movie cannot be produced utilizing native speakers of other languages. For instance, the Russian language is horrible in all the episodes it was used. I am sure Russians would be happy to lend you a hand, and the show would be more credible if native speakers were used. Native Russian speakers should be selected not from so-called Russian experts in DC, who just studied the language, but could never master the accent or cannot use correct grammar - they should be selected from Brighton Beach or Russian-speaking communities around the country. There are plenty of those in the USA. But, again, most Hollywood productions suffer from this flaw, which leads to great disappointments..."
58,"This shows sucks big time. The most unbelievable story lines acted out by some of the lamest, boring actors in the business. Marc Harmon is the living embodiment of Forest Gump, he's only got an IQ of 75 but some how he keeps working. Seriously, this show is as lame as it gets. God help you if you enjoy this CRAP."
59,"The first 12 or so seasons were great,but the writing has gotten weak, and how many times can you tell similar stories in similar settings. The last 4 years get a 1 star rating. CBS should have canceled NCIS and kept going with The Code."
60,"This show has survived the coming and going of many cast members over the years, but the latest changes -- Michael Weatherly out, Jennifer Esposito and Wilmer Valderrama in -- doesn't look promising. The total ridiculousness of the stories and the absurd ""science"" have always been big negatives, but the interplay of the characters made it watchable in spite of the problems.Even without Weatherly, they are trying to fit his father (Robert Wagner) into the story line and it just seems silly.Maybe the chemistry will improve as the season progresses, but so far (9 episodes into season 15) it just isn't working for me."
61,"The first episode I saw of this series was really quite original. We were presented with a disparate team of 'experts', each with their own particular brand of inadequacy or character, led by an able, middle-aged gent.To me, at least, the idea was good for about half a dozen episodes. After that, the whole format became repetitive beyond belief. There's so much CSI on telly at the moment - especially on Channel 5 - that the program makers obviously needed to do something different. Their tack was to emphasise the character traits of the players.From here, I thought it went down hill. The format became an exercise in self-parody. Abby became more goth; Tony became more macho, Ducky became more abstruse, and so on. The actual crimes and investigations became secondary to the tiresome sparring, and excessively juvenile personal politics.I used to make a particular point of watching this series and would have awarded it 8 stars. Now I can't be arsed, and begrudge the 6 I've posted.Incidentally, does anybody know how Jethro is going to get that boat out of his cellar, presupposing he ever finishes it? The place seems only accessible down a narrow flight of stairs.Oh, and one other thing. When I worked in laboratories in both pathology and the petrochemical industry; eating and drinking at the work-place was a summary-dismissible offence on account of the risks of poisoning, infection or contamination. In one department, even ball-pens and all cosmetics were banned. Seems that the US navy run a slacker ship than the rest of the world."
62,"Having ignored this programme for most of the years that my wife has been watching it, I have tried to watch the latest series. I cannot believe this programme has survived if this is what it serves up weekly. The acting, the characters, the script, the quality of the editing and production and the storylines, oh the storylines: all astonishingly bad. With the superior shows being served up on Amazon, Netflix etc, it is difficult to understand how this passes and kind of scrutiny by the network. Utter dross."
63,"My mom watches this show religiously and I catch episodes here and there when I visit her and it is the most poorly written drivel I have ever seen in my life. It's unrealistic and the writing is childish and beyond stupid.How this has lasted 6 seasons is beyond my reckoning.Beyond the complete and utter lack of realism and disregard for the affluence of the potential audience, the characters are just boring. Each seems to have their own little quirk that defines their character and that's it. Some might say, ""well if you watched more episodes you'd get the characters,"" and to that I say, ""who cares."""
64,"I loved this show when it first started ( I scored it a solid 9) and continued to up until the end of Season 13.....That is where it should have finished. With nearly all the original cast gone and poor Ducky semi-retired, Gibbs is left floundering on his own with lots of new cast members that just have not worked, least of all is Maria Bello whose character does very little apart from get in the way, and for a character that is supposed to be getting in peoples heads to interrogate or help them, she seems to need more help than all of them put together. Gibbs just seems lost and coasting, I know this show has been green lit for a 16th Season and I really do think that should be it, but I am sure that the powers that be will flog this horse long after its dead. This show is a tired shadow of what it was and should hang up its gun and badge while it still has a pulse. 
(and don't even get me started on NCIS:LA, a generic cop show that they just stuck NCIS on the front of to sell it, a regurgitation of what they did with CSI Miami (Cops in the sun), New Orleans is better but still a poor relation. Rant over."
65,The musical background over shadows the voice. I've quit watching since you added the music. I like the story but not the noise. gee you want me to say delete the music -DELETE THE MUSIC DELETE THE MUSIC DELETE THE BACKGROUND MUSIC - IT HURTS MY EARS.DELETE THE MUSIC DELETE THE MUSIC
66,"One of the best TV series of all time. However:...Regarding the original character - Anthony DiNozzo - and his farewell at the end of Season 13, I thought it was overly sentimental and weak. The character needed some grounding on the sentimental side after 12 plus seasons of drifting between attachments, but he was always the person-in-waiting for all fans to become the next #1 (Gibbs-like; or even better!) However, they short-changed his end story by making him a less than heroic - yes: admirable (but all the principal characters are by definition admirable) but Tony was the other Alpha and was with a severe suddenness made into a sedate Beta. Boo! Perhaps there will be a time to reestablish his character's true credibility in the future of the NCIS franchise - to the satisfaction of all - but time will tell, of course, as it always does."
67,"I saw this show a couple of weeks ago (and I just now realised that that episode was the first xD) and thought that it was great! Here in Australia we're only a couple of weeks into it, but I'm hooked. It's the TV highlight of my week.I'm always wary of these shows in the 8:30 or 9:30 time slot because they're normally terrible crime shows like Law and Order, however NCIS is in a league of its own.I love the little gags they always throw in to put a break in the work focus. Such as the coffee stealing and caffeine incidents in last night's episode.The connection between the characters is fantastic, creating a light-hearted work environment, creating opportunities for friendly humour.NCIS has made me open my eyes to similar shows such as JAG, a show which I've also become addicted to in the past couple of weeks.It is a MUST WATCH SHOW!"
68,"Okay, we've seen enough of the odd kid from that 70's show...i realize the navy has a don't want or need to know or whatever that policy is but we don't need a flake of different colors on this show...making him into a fake facade of his real self won't hack it either...and whiskers don't do it either...mark harmon must have lost his mind to add such a cast member and reject the beautiful jennifer esposito after one season...matters not as i've stopped watching this crud"
69,"Just watched series 17 about video gaming shooting teddy bears
WHAT TOTAL SHITE
PLEASE PLEASE KILL THIS SHOW
Just watched an episode about an old coin. This series is plummeting depths previously uncharted."
70,"First and foremost: I love the show. But it has gotten to the point where it is now No Gibbs, No Show. That's not a good thing. The characters used to be much stronger. Ziva is gone. Tony is gone. Abby is gone. Shepherd is gone. Fornell is retired. Franks is gone. Only Gibbs, Ducky, and Tim are left from the ""A"" team of the past. I think this year 2019-2020 will be their last. I think Mark Harmon is probably tired and who could blame him. He's carrying the show now with very little help."
71,"Torres is made to act like a 15 yr old kid. Is very annoying. As for Abs replacement, she just is not working. I like Jack she adds to the story.. try shopping around for replacements that are not like the originals."
72,"I have watched NCIS from the very first episode and enjoyed some of the story lines very much. I do understand that it is all fiction! However, WHAT are the writers thinking? The last few years have followed the exact same pattern. During the season; We are supposed to believe that the team are so good they catch all baddies with very little effort but near the end of of the season we are supposed to believe they are so dumb that baddies manage to bug their phones, Abby's lab etc. AND then we find that they know exactly who the bad guy is but he/she gets away with multiple murders, robberies whatever, and when one of our heroes confronts them he/she manages to kill, maim or disarm all the minions but asks the biggest baddie to put their hands up, of course said baddie gets away to kill, maim etc for a few more episodes before our hero takes (usually) one shot, one punch, etc(FINALLY) and captures or kills the scumbag. NCIS LA and NCIS NO are exactly the same just different actors. Will have to find something else to watch!"
73,"Used to LOVE this show. The newer cast additions are a MAJOR disappointment.
There are hundreds of very talented Latino actors - WHY was ""Fez"" hired?"
74,"This show is pure waste of money and time. Created as a crime show, but it is more like bad comedy with tragic acting, semi-idiotic characters and boring story. But a lot of people seem to enjoy it and I wish them to have good time watching it."
75,Very sad to hear about the cutting of 2 more people on the show! I faithfully watch all the shows even reruns! One of my favorite programs! First you have Zivea leave then Tony goes to join her. Now Ducky ( on leave ) & Abby ( last season) you are taking away the cast that we all love to watch! Please stop cutting cast as the show will not be the same. Heart broken loyal fan!
76,"I started watching this series a few years after it started and went back through previous seasons to catch up...Admittedly you need to suspend any sense of reality to enjoy this show as with many other similar shows... however thats a good thing as TV shows are about escaping and stepping into an alternate world...with alternate characters...So with that in mind I have enjoyed the shows..... I was never a lover of Ziva character but it worked within the team of characters... a balance I guess you could say...I have been watching since the new character to replace Ziva arrived and although as a character, Ellie really doesn't work for me.... the character itself isn't in line with the shows balance...I know some reviews mention her traits and methods within the show... that to be honest isn't the problem for me... its the way that character sits within the team and ultimately the show.... as we all know every character is unrealistic and more of a caricature.... so this new character and her traits aren't for me the issue...its the way that particular character just doesn't work within the team and balance of the show.... by deliberately avoiding going for a similar character as Ziva the makers have tried to go a different way and to me it ain't worked.... I have seen a few guest characters that would work better and create good relationships and open more story lines... this character ain't one of them...I find myself forwarding her scenes to avoid the irritation her character brings...I have only found myself being irritated by one other character during the shows seasons and that is the Coast Guard Agent Borin she was terrible...so OTT at trying to be something she clearly couldn't be .... like some sort of female Gibbs character... she was really irritating both as a character and as the actress trying to play that role ... maybe a different actress would have made that work but certainly not Diane Neal...I hope the makers of the show do change this new character..I can see myself drifting away from this show if they don't...But then maybe the other side of the coin is that the show is not putting out the same level of episodes and story lines that it used to... and my dislike of that new character is more about the overall than just the that..?"
77,"For the last 7 years Mark Harmon and his baseball team, the Bombers, have been doing a celebrity baseball game to raise money for The Children's Center in Bethany, Oklahoma. I just want everyone know what an awesome man Mark and his team are. This year on June the 9th, they raised $234,000.00 for The Children's Center.The Children's Center is a long term rehab hospital for children. It's a one of a kind hospital. They do wonderful things at this hospital and there are children from many surrounding states. My grandson was transferred to the center in March of this year.He is doing things that the doctors said he would never do. Hopefully in the next few months, we will be able to take him home for his 1st birthday.God Bless you Mark, for the seven years you have given to the children."
78,"NCIS had been on TV a while when I got into the series. I used to see it while flicking through the channels, I quickly flicked over to another channel, just because I didn't think I'd like it but one night when there wasn't much of the TV, I had no choice but to watch it and as soon as the episode finished, I was so blown away by it and I have been engrossed it in ever since.Being in the UK, I had never heard of NCIS so I didn't know what it stood for and as I watched the show I found my knowledge of the organisation growing the longer I watched it.This show works on so many great levels. Number one is the actors, I just love the way they interact with each other, they are like a family and act like one too. Mark Harmon plays Leroy Jethro Gibbs (what a stroke of genius, giving him that name), he is a former gunnery sergeant who is the boss of a group of investigators. He is the father, who can be strict and unbending but he clearly cares for his team and goes to bat for them when they are in trouble. Lauren Holly plays the director of NCIS (Jenny Shepard) who has a past with Gibbs and they act like a married couple at times, arguing about cases. I do like the relationship between Gibbs and Tony, I always laugh when Tony says the wrong thing and gets a slap across the back of the head, that has me in fits of hysterics as the situation is never sent up in the same way. Michael Weatherly (Anthony DiNozzo), he used to be a former homicide detective before he joined NCIS. He is like a small boy who has never grown up, he is into his movies, he loves the women and likes to make fun of McGee, much to McGee's annoyance. McGee (Sean Murray) is the probie who is a MIT graduate and a whizz with computers. He is like the little brother who wants to be so much like Tony and yet at times not so such. Pauley Perrette (Abby Sciuto) is the goth forensics specialist who is the fun and exciting sister that mothers warn their sons about. Cote de Pablo (Ziva David) is a former Moussad agent, she is the big sister who everyone is wary of. She is just as wary of forming attachments as she has lost a lot of people in her life and she can defend herself which seems to bond her with Gibbs. She if finding it hard to adjust to a different environment that she is not used to. Finally, there is the brilliant David McCallum who plays Donald 'Ducky' Mallard, he is the medical examiner. He is a kind grandfather who the others go to for advice. One of the best things about Ducky is he likes to stray from a subject into his many entertaining stories. I sometimes wish Gibbs would let him tell us the end of the stories as they sound truly fascinating.I like that NCIS investigates a wide range of crimes involving the Navy and Marines such as murder, espionage, terrorism. It is interesting to see the different procedures, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service has compared to the police.This series is not just one type of genre, it has many layers to it. There is comedy, drama, action, tension, twists and turns in one programme. The writing just manages to show it all in a good way and the writers are able to switch between the genres to carry the plot along. They clearly have good advisers because the episodes are sensibly concluded and there is never any thought that this wouldn't happen in real life.It is created by Donald P. Bellisario who brought the world Jag, Quantum Leap, Airwolf, Magnum P.I who seems interested in Military themes as this features in his shows in some form or another.I do hope there are more seasons of this programme to come because now I am really hooked and it has become another of my favourite shows on TV."
79,"seriously out of all the t.v. that i watch, which seems to be a lot, ncis has to be my favorite. All the great actors including Mark Harmon, Michael Weatherly (hottie!), Sasha Alexander as the main characters. I think what makes ncis rise above the rest of the crime shows, is the in-depth personalities that each main character has. Every episode is something completely different and offers a great hour of enjoyment. Humour though, i think is the key to ncis's success. For a crime show to be funny, but still uphold it's great plots is something the directors should be applauded for. Mark Harmon is an asset to the show offering a familiar (not to forget hot!) face, as does Michael Weatherly who plays the womanizing, yet cutie Tony DiNozzo, while his partner Caitin Todd played by Sasha Alexander offers good competition and a down to earth personality. Not to forget the goth forensic scientist Abby and Autopsy's Ducky who top off the wonderful cast. Ten out of Ten, watch it on channel ten, 9.30pm Wednesday night!please, if your a massive fan of ncis, visit my website www.ilovencis.com it has everything you want to know about the show and actors!"
80,"Out of the three NCIS this is the best, but it is sinking fast. First Ziva and Tony and Abby gone has left a huge hole in the cast. What were they thinking on Abby replacement. I find her irritating ànd she is completely miscasted. Ducky and Mark are still amusing. Jack is a complete waste and does not add anything to the show. It is still on my playlist."
81,"I can't say I will miss having Abby on the show. Her character never grew over time and she was getting a bit old to pull off the, ""Gibs, Gibs, Gibs,"" routine. Her signature Goth look went out of style and became a Goofy look. Even being generous with a timeline, Abby had to be at least 40 & was still wearing silly school girl costumes. Over time it became distracting instead of endearing."
82,No wonder NCIS is losing viewers. Too many new characters with they're own issue's. The plot is flimsy. Tonight's episode is a prime example of why I haven't bothered to watch this season. They brought back their version of David Baldacci's Camel Club. Read the books and you'll see my point. Too many people working on a simple case as opposed to a simple story going in different misleading directions to make the NCIS figure out the case. The Sherlocks...what a joke!!
83,"I'm reviewing NCIS after watching 12 seasons.I don't know how I made it past 5 seasons actually. But sometimes there's nothing to watch. The show actually started out OK. But after Sasha Alexander was killed off it just became an avalanche of badly repeated recipes, mixed with some extremely cliché characters.The NCIS is not an anti-terrorist task force. Yet this is how the show portrays them. All the characters are the worst stereotype you can think of. Maybe not Ducky. He's the only one that is likable.What frustrates me most is how CHEAP the show is. 90% of the victims are found in the same setting : either a park or somewhere near a wooden area. Then the rest of the show takes place in the cheapest FAKEST office building, with very obvious fake walls, fake windows, fake doors, fake lights. Save for the protagonists, no one seems to work in the office !! All they do is walk in the background, over and over again at the same pace for no reason at all. Not one bit is believable. Now the night scenes : the same stupid street is used for ALL the episodes. For a show that takes place in DC, they could have at least have SOME scenes in DC, right? Nope.Conclusion : unrealistic, unbelievable writing, terrible corny jokes, unlikeable characters, can't believe they made 12 seasons of this"
84,"The show has it all! Romance, drama, action, humor, you name it. It has been on since 2003! And it is the #1 drama, surpassing CSI on the CBS network, that also airs both dramas.Mark Harmon is cast as the lead, LeRoy Jethro Gibbs. As he is a old school hero in the form of John Wayne. And that he cares about his team, despite not showing emotions. He is cool, calm, level-headed but sympathetic at the same time. And doesn't want his team either hurt. But not to mess up on their cases.The supporting cast is just as good. As Michael Weatherly as the wisecracking Tony DiNizzo, Cote De Pablo as no-nonsense Ziva David the ex-Mossad agent, Sean Murray as Tim ""Probie"" McGee, the tech expert. And David McCallum(The Man from UNCLE) as the wise, witty Ducky, the team's medical examiner. But the one that steals the show is Pauley Perrette as comic relief, tech lab person Abby Schutto. As she steals the show from everybody with her wit, charm, and shows that she does care about Gibbs team. The show you just couldn't ask for more in this. With it all it has to offer. See the show yourself, in order to know what I mean."
85,"Be fun! That's what this show gets right. Do we remember what fun TV was like? Remember the sheer (albeit cheesy) entertainment value of the 80s prime time shows? Airwolf, Knight Rider, A-Team, Magnum etc which sacrificed strict adherence to the laws (judicial and physical!) to entertain TV viewers? Week after week the officers of NCIS deal with murders, kidnappings and other threats to the lives of Naval officers across the globe (well at least the U.S.) but rather than adhere to the dark, overly serious tone of the law&orders or CSI's this program offsets the (often heinous) crime of the week with the banter between the central characters. Now I'm not suggesting that crime is a laughing matter but a lot of shows on TV have substituted entertainment for large doses of shock value reality. Detailed autopsies and simulations of how an icepick can crack open a skull are okay, but not at the expense of following the whole investigation. While the CSI's follow a Holmes like approach with regards to evidence, NCIS distinguishes the forest from the trees as it were, by switching to and from the autopsy/evidence/forensics back to the larger case. I guess I'm a viewer who doesn't find the notion of meticulous attention to detail on an entertainment show that rewarding.Truth be told, I was not expecting such a clichéd assortment of characters to click as well as they did. We have the silent but strong type leader (Gibbs), his boss and former lover (Shepard), his older friend and mentor (Ducky), the hotshot womanizer (DiNozzo), the rookie agent/computer genius (McGee), the spunky female agent (Kate/Ziva) and the happiest, Goth forensic examiner (Abby) - okay, well she's an original. What impressed me is how the writers breathe fresh life into what could have been just another ensemble.While the stories of the week are interesting enough, they've all been covered ad nauseum in many different shows: homicide; hostage-taking; blackmail; assassination-threats etc Credit must be given to the writers for the humor that's been injected into this show - whether it's DiNozzo cracking on McGee or Gibbs admonishing his Junior agents - the wonderful chemistry the cast seem to share comes through every time 2 or more of them are on screen. Pauley Perrette is a delight to watch While the dialogue may not always crackle there is enough zip and some genuinely funny one-liners that somehow develop these characters beyond the 2D cardboard cutouts they could have become.I continue to look forward to this show every week and Season 4 seems to have lost none of the momentum of the past 2 seasons. One complaint I often hear about this show, is that it seems unrealistic how fast the cases get solved. I'll grant you that McGee and Abby seem to have superhuman abilities to process data and crack codes, but I submit to you that the 3 act structure that a typical episode of this show presents, requires a certain amount of time compression to fit into the 42 minutes and change of every broadcast hour. Seeing how 24 continues to entertain us despite the absence of traffic i.e. realism, I'll continue to give this show leeway as long as it remains interesting."
86,"I am very upset about Gibbs leaving. I hope this is a ruse, that he gets tired of fishing, and returns in the fall. I like Tony but he is not strong enough to keep my attention as team leader. He is too immature. Gibbs (Mark Harmon) was one of the main reasons I loved the show so much. It has been my all time favorite (up until last night). I was disappointed when Kate left but felt that as long as Gibbs stayed, everything would be all right. I think that if Mark Harmon is leaving (or thinking or leaving) that the producers and/or network should offer him any and every incentive to stay. I am in the first wave of the baby boomers and there are a lot of us. We have (and spend money) and have never been shy about standing up and having our say. One thing I hope you are not doing is gearing the show to the younger ages only. I am a math teacher at a girl's school and teach juniors and seniors calculus and statistics. All who watch NCIS really like Gibbs also, so he does not just appeal to the older watchers. Conclusion: Keep NCIS as good as it is. It is my favorite show!"
87,"This is the best U.S show yet. there's action, comedy, tongue in cheek all rolled into one. I never miss an episode, but I've got one big question and if anybody in American TV world can answer me, then let me know. WHEN IS IT GOING TO BE RELEASED ON DVD? Come on guys, we are into season 3, most t.v show get on DVD after the first season, so what's the makers of N.C.I.S playing at? I mean I just saw advertised on T.V the first season of House, and to be honest, I don't know nobody who's actually watched that show, because I haven't and I would say more people watch N.C.I.S than House. So if other shows can get on DVD quickly, why can't N.C.I.S"
88,"I had just started to watch CSI and was flicking through the the Sky channels and found Navy NCIS on the FX channel. It only took one episode to get me hooked on to it, I like the characters seen to interact and gel with each other. First there's Gibbs the boss played by Mark Harmon, Gibbs is a great character he is serious when it comes to the job but he also has a humour side to him that works well with other characters.Di Nozzo is funny and again works well with his humour especially with Gibbs.Caitlin started as the new girl and it has been interesting to her build with her fellow NCIS agents through out the series, It's a shame that actress Sacha Alexander wanted to leave and the producers decided to kill her off, maybe would of been better for her to transfer and leave the door open for future guest appearances.Abby is the scientist, maybe a female goth version of Gil Grissom and actress Pauley Perrette portrays brilliantly.David McCallum plays Donald Ducky Mallard the coroner who is often found going off on a tangent and what were the creators drinking the night they come up with that name.Agent Timothy Mcgee is the latest addition to the show, he started as computer whizz and now has been promoted to a field agent and his scenes with Abby are great.Long live the NCIS team and I look forward to future series.Also worth mentioning that Alan Dale stars as Tom Morrow the head of NCIS, most of the soap watching community will remember him in Australian soap opera Neighbours.Well the above was written after watching the first 2 series of NCIS, so now I thought I would comment on what I think of the show in series 3 and 4.Got to say it has got even better, not just the stories but the development on the characters. First there is the introduction of Ziva David the Mossad agent who is now working with NCIS. Her character has fitted in well with the rest of the team and her interaction with Tony is good and at times very funny.Next there is the new director of NCIS who is Jenny Shepherd who is played by Laren Holly, her and Gibbs have a past and it is interesting to see them be reunited and of course Gibbs getting use to her being the boss. Gibbs left then came back (as we knew he would), Agent Lee also joined the team very briefly and does make occasional appearances due to her romance (if you wanna call it that) with Jimmy Palmer.Also the story of Tony falling in love, Jenny Shepherds obsession of capturing an arms dealer and Magee's bestselling book have kept the series fresh and interesting, and have shown that it is not just one show one story.Keep up the good work.Time for another update as season 5 comes to a close in the UK although we are getting to see the first episode of season 6 a few days after it airs in the US.Another great season from beginning to end, which seen the end of the Frog and also the end Tony's romance with Jeann. Some good stories throughout the series and what a great ending, Jenny Shepheard killed off not sure if she wanted to go or the producers decided to get rid of the character, the ending also see's the disbanding of the team Ziva goes home, Mcgee goes to the cyber crime unit, Tony goes on board a ship and Gibbs gets a new team.Part of the new team is agent Lee who we have see before, I have read on some websites that fans wont be watching if Gibbs has a new team, the team will be back together,the producers are just making it more unmissable they know that it would kill the show if Tony, Ziva and Mcgee were written out.Looking forward to season 6"
89,"I watched the show for about a year in its third or forth season and then stopped. I watched it again last night and all of the reasons why I quit watching it came back. The odds on assembling a similar group of misfits in real life have to be astronomical. What I find interesting about the cast of characters is the one who is closest to being ""normal"" is a trained Mossad assassin.First, there is Gibbs who has the social skills of dirt. You may be able to get away with some of the things he pulls as a Marine but given the way the government currently deals with its employees Jethro wouldn't last a month. Not to mention the staff turnover Gibbs would have because no one would stand for being treated the way he treats the people on his team. There are probably a few poor souls watching the show who actually think the Gibbs approach is the way to lead a successful group.Then there is Tony, the man child who hasn't quite graduated from college yet. I completely endorse having one helluva good time in college but there comes a time when you have to leave and become something that remotely resembles an adult. Tony has yet to reach that point. The writers often play on Tony's broad knowledge of movies. The only way he could have accumulated that knowledge is by watching old movies seven days a week, most likely alone because his Neanderthal approach to women is so successful. Tony was raised in what could only be referred to as the world's most dysfunctional family. He needs constant reinforcement.Next we have McGee who hasn't developed a shred of self confidence or learned a thing about how to approach an investigation since he joined the team 5+ years ago. They did have something going with McGee that I enjoyed very much – Tim the successful author. However, they dropped it I imagine because all of the money he was making as an author would have ultimately put him in a different financial class than the rest of the group.And then there is Abby. Abby is a very capable scientist/technician who at times can only be described as spastic. Her lifestyle doesn't bother me as much as her approach to just about everything else. There were probably at least 5 or 6 situations during the year that I watched the show that she became so hysterical that in real life someone would have slapped her to bring her back to reality. There was no such situation last night but they were close.Next, comes Dr. ""Ducky"" Mallard, one of the original men from UNCLE. Ducky's downfall is the breadth and depth of his knowledge. Whenever he opens his mouth the odds are better than 50/50 he will bore you to death. You do have to give him credit for carrying his 75 or 76 years very well.Finally, there is Ziva, the trained Mossad assassin very skilled in marksmanship, the martial arts and everything else a highly trained Mossad agent would be trained in. When I watched NCIS I hoped Ziva would beat the crap out of Tony almost on a weekly basis but no such luck. Ziva does tend to ""mother"" Tony. As if he didn't have more than enough of that as a child."
90,"Whatever the episode of NCIS with the child of an NCIS employee who was allegedly kidnapped was ABYSMAL. Why does Hollywood expect us to believe that old midgets are children? The kid wasn't precocious -- he was annoying. Children should act like children. And Mark Harmon ""bonding"" with him over Seattle's Best Coffee was pathetic. His character doesn't seem like the ""I love kids, especially annoying, bossy types"" kind of guy. Why isn't it okay to let children on TV act as children -- shy or confused would be acceptable qualities for this kid's character, but those weren't displayed. Instead, the kid came in as if he could run NCIS. I suppose with the buffoons currently employed on the show, he could. And the way he talked was more annoying than Lauren Holly's mouth movements. Mark Harmon acted as if he was a long-lost roommate. And he was allowed to run amok a highly classified joint. Just terrible. Won't watch the show again."
91,"this is a current favourite from America, its fairly contemporary in dialogue and character interraction and has some nice subtle humour at timesall the characters are likable and each episode moves along at a good pacethe stories aren't always amazing but there is sometimes a nice twist or two , i liked the episodes with the israeli agent Also i quite fancy the woman who plays Kate :)) David Mccallum is very good in this also the show doesn't take itself too seriously and is fun to watchrecommended"
92,Good characters and a good show you can watch anytime or binge on.
93,"A spin-off of Donald P. Bellisario's military show 'JAG', 'NCIS' is a favourite of mine at the moment. The show revolves around the Naval Criminal Intelligence Service, an organisation which investigates crimes involving the Navy and Marines, and is very much like a police drama in comparison to 'JAG'.Not only are most of the story lines interesting and compelling but the characters are engaging. American law enforcement shows have always been superior to British shows in depicting the close camaraderie of a team who work side-by-side in a tough job and 'NCIS' is a great example of this. From the no-nonsense boss Gibbs to the devil-may-care DiNozzo to the goth Abby, you truly feel this is a group of people who care for each other and would do anything to protect their team mates. Credit is definitely due to the cast for being so faultless in their performances.There are times when the show is a bit too light-hearted and quirky for my liking but this is easily forgotten when watching some of the more darker episodes. It will be interesting to see how 'NCIS' continues to develop, especially with the recent introduction of a new main character, although I sincerely hope it avoids the pitfalls of 'JAG' by focusing on being about the NCIS rather than delving too much in the love lives of the characters.It is a shame that this show is so under-rated in the UK, where it's been shoved on some obscure Sky channel, because it does have the potential to be great and I think there are many out there who would enjoy it."
94,"DPB never planned to have a episodes that are hardly Navy and have a ""cute"" girl sitting on the floor. In all of his creations, he never had an actor or actress that sat on the floor to attract young viewers. Only wild GG did that and is destroying the original storyline of NCIS.NCIS was to be about Navy/Marine Corp-incidents/crimes, just as JAG was. NCIS S1-2 did that beautifully with the team well gelled even with Kate Todd. Sasha Alexander left and they brought in wild cases but still Navy-centered. Then slowly the lost tract and made Ziva an NCIS agent. That was too extreme but the storyline still stayed. Even if CdP left suddenly, they still should have thought it thoroughly first before conjuring up a wild character. No, instead they made their new agent as one with no Federal Agent experience--Kate Todd was from the Secret Service and guarded POTUS, Ziva was from the Mossad and was Kidon. The new agent simply is an weakling who supposedly worked best on the floor. No Federal Agent or key character in any major TV series has never done that! It is not unique, it is not a selling point, it did not help improve the NCIS storyline!Fast forward now. They realised their mistake but even if the crowd jewel Bishop is no longer on the floor or snacking, she creates no dramatic tension, no chemistry with team members or the whole team and is used to whine or gossip. Also, NCIS now is hardly about a Navy case--it is more ""hey dead Navy/MC body, OK nex some weird storyline"". That's it. The other characters--Tony, McGee and the rest have done less with ""magical"" Bishop around. Only Ducky remains constant.Bottom line: DPB's creation is being destroyed. and Bishop is the worst of it."
95,"N.C.I.S (Naval Criminal Investigative Service) is a crime procedural set in Washington D.C. that follows a team of special agents who solve crimes involving naval officers and marines. The show was created by Donald P. Bellisario, who also produced JAG and Magnum P.I., as a spin off of JAG in 2003. It airs Tuesday nights at 8pm. The show creates great stories through a very likable, yet diverse cast in character driven plots with a perfect mix of drama and comedy. The show centers on the NCIS Major Case Response Team of Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon), Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly), Special Agent Tim McGee (Sean Murray), Caitlin Todd (Sasha Alexander), Ziva David (Cote De Pablo), Dr. Donald ""Ducky"" Mallard (David McCallum), and Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette). Leroy Jethro Gibbs is an ex-marine sniper who is the leader of the team. He is very dedicated to his job and also very good at what he does. He lives by a set of rules that are often quoted in episodes such as rule #7 ""Always be specific when you lie."" He does have many character flaws, however, such as his obsession over certain terrorists or his three ex- wives. Gibbs consumes large amounts of coffee and in his spare time he builds a boat. Anthony DiNozzo is an ex-Baltimore homicide detective and the team's senior special agent behind Gibbs. Despite his flaws of being a relatively unsuccessful womanizer, he gets the job done in the end. DiNozzo loves movies and can relate almost any case to a movie he has seen.Tim McGee is a computer specialist who graduated from MIT. He was a recurring character during the shows first season but became a full time agent at the beginning of the second season. McGee is very good with computers but is socially awkward at times. Caitlin Todd is an ex-secret service agent who joined the team at the end of the first episode in the first season. She is a very good profiler and disgusted by DiNozzo's womanizing behavior which is used for humor. Agent Todd is only on the show for the first two seasons.Ziva David is a Mossad Liason Officer and she becomes a full time agent in the seventh season. She comes in at the beginning of the third season to stop Gibbs from killing her half-brother Ari Haswari who killed Caitlin Todd but ends up being the one to kill Ari. Ducky is the NCIS Medical Examiner. He has traveled the world doing autopsies and has seen just about everything. In almost every situation he has a story but usually gets cut off by Gibbs or whoever is asking him what he found.Abby Sciuto is the forensic specialist. She is goth, listens to heavy metal, sleeps in a coffin, and practically mainlines caffeine. One main thing that makes the show great is the actors and how convincing they are in their respective roles. For example, David McCallum, who plays Ducky, has studied anatomy since taking the role and actually knows what he is talking about, unlike most actors. Pauley Perrette (Abby) has been interested in forensics her whole life and studied criminology at Valdosta State. In comparison to similar crime drama shows such as the CSI franchise, NCIS knocks it out of the park. The characters in NCIS are more relatable to real life than those in CSI mainly because they have many the same flaws and characteristics as common Americans. Also, NCIS has more comedy than most crime drama's with the possible exception of Human Target, which was canceled after two seasons anyway. NCIS just finished its eighth season and became the highest rated scripted show on television in its seventh season, which is very unusual for a show to do that, showing that the best is still to come. It ranked fifth in all shows (including sports and reality shows) the last three years, and the ratings prove that it's not just me who loves the show but a majority of the people who watch TV on a Tuesday night. It is a phenomenal show and I would recommend it to anyone regardless of preference to comedy or drama because it has such a great mix of both."
96,"An enjoyable, if not wildly challenging, crime series, that doesn't take itself too seriously. Definitely the best of the CIS/CSI alphabet soup, with a good mix of young and older actors.The producers have had the good sense to centre the action around Mark Harmon, while giving the lion's share of the by-play to the satellite characters: Tony, Ziva (will they/won't they?), Kate, Ducky and, of course, the weird and wonderful Abby. I wasn't too sure about the introduction of the Timothy McGee character, but he seems to have fitted in well and the banter between him and Tony is great fun.The pace is good, but the real enjoyment comes from the interplay between the secondary characters, who kick sparks off each other with obvious relish. Great to see David McCallum back on the small screen again too. Sad to say, I'm old enough to remember him as Ilya Kuryakin.I hope it doesn't outlive its time, but I think I can stand another few series."
97,"This show has been hugely popular since it was first aired, and it seems to be growing in popularity as time goes by. This is a puzzle for me as I find it to be a very frustrating show to watch. The problem? The writers of this show assume that everyone in ""Viewer Land"" is a complete moron who is willing to accept that highly skilled and professional people who are responsible for saving people's lives on a daily basis are instead completely immature and irresponsible in the carrying out of their duties. I have only watched a half dozen episodes and already I have seen the characters exhibit unprofessional behavior to a degree that just leaves you shaking your head where you sit. I see bricklayers and plumbers showing more maturity and concentration in their work on a daily basis, and so it boggles the mind that a majority of the viewing public can willingly accept that people in a top level military investigative center would carry on so irresponsibly. People's lives are on the line and time is running out, and the investigators on the case are doing cartwheels in the lab, chewing gum, making unrelated jokes and comments constantly, focusing on a co-worker's moustache during an interrogation, etc, etc, etc. To all those die-hard fans out there - I'm sorry, but I would have to drop my IQ by about a hundred points before I could enjoy this, so why would I bother when there's several brilliant CSI and L&O programs to watch where the investigators are completely professional and responsible? This show's only saving grace is that it does have several good actors in it who give their 100% to every episode, and so out of respect to them I give NCIS 4 stars."
98,"I got into NCIS only during the past summer but I was so engrossed with the show that I watched it start to finish. It had a rocky start, sure, with the show trying to find its footing and its niche, but it figured out what it wanted to be fast and I find it to be FAR superior to its parent show, JAG. The plots, the characters, the cases, the everything, in this show, makes it great.NCIS is the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, an actual organization, which investigates the homicides and crimes committed by or against members of the US Navy - i.e. naval civilian officers, navy officers and enlisted, and marine officers and enlisted. They're also very obscure, and hence are seen as the underdog of law enforcement(in the show, anyway) but, of course, as our heroes, they are brilliant. The main character, Leroy Jethro Gibbs, is a former gunnery sergeant Marine sniper with a murky and depressing past (like Bellisario likes to make his characters) and appears to have a consistent team of four characters: Abby Sciuto, the forensics expert, Anthony DiNozzo, the senior field agent, and Timothy McGee, the computer forensics expert and field agent who joined the show as a permanent member in season 2.Earlier in the show, Kate Todd, played by Sasha Alexander, was also a member of the team and a former member of the Secret Service tasked with protecting the life of the president. Her character ended up being killed in one of the most brilliant story arcs I've seen on TV, and being replaced by Ziva David, a very unique character in terms of law enforcement drama, as she is a Mossad officer - i.e. her training is not investigation, but rather assassination and intelligence gathering.The show has two very strong aspects to it which really make it stand out from the other generic shows of its kind like CSI. Firstly, the characters are, while somewhat stereotypical in their mold, fully developed and incredibly dynamic. Tony is perhaps the best example of this - when the show started he was a goofy, slightly moronic field agent, and he developed into the professional, trained officer who keeps his sense of humor in check or uses it to his advantage. Relationships between the characters changed dramatically, with Ziva and Tony starting out as small friends and quickly graduating to huge amounts of romantic tension - which of course ends up playing a massive role in the 6th season and ultimately brings the events to their culmination. The second aspect of the show that really makes it unique to me is both the creativity of the individual cases and the amazing nature of the story arcs. The La Grenouille story arc was absolutely brilliant and I could not have foreseen it, and the introduction of Ari and Michael were equally fascinating. In addition to that, the show is not afraid to make some bold choices (for those who have seen the season 2 finale, they know what I'm talking about). Characters can go and come and even with the main ones, there's no certainty. It's the mark of a good television show.The dark horse of the show, Dr. Mallard, played by famous Scottish actor David McCallum, is probably the most intriguing of these characters. As a body forensics expert he has a strange past that he loves to share but personally, as a medical student, I found the accuracy of his character's work to be fascinating. The autopsy scenes, while grisly, fascinate me because they're quite accurate in their depiction and their protocol.This show is worth seeing and is a family show; I think it can be watched by more than one generation at a time and is thoroughly enjoyable. 9/10"
99,"This series is one of the best that EVER appeared on TV. Considering how much TV we are watching nowadays, this looks exaggerated, but it is not. The cases (the scripts) originate from the life of the US Navy. They are original, even bizarre sometimes, but it looks that we live with that kind of people.Second, the acting is very good, and the characters are almost real life people, so sometimes you have to remind yourself that you are watching TV. The actors are not very famous, but they all do an excellent job.Mark Harmon's character is excellent and I would be very sorry to see him leave the show (S3, 3x23 and 3x24, Hiatus part 1 &2), but let's hope that it is because of the suspense of the cliff-hanger, just trying to keep spectators anxious for the next (fourth) season, which I sincerely hope will be forthcoming.He is the strongest link, the one who does not talk much, honest to the bone, but deeply compassionate. He takes care of everybody and holds them together (not only his team, but the families of the victims, and sometimes even the criminals). The others follow and, when you have a good leader, everything is possible. You have to see it to believe it. I could write for hours, but watching any episode will do the trick and replace pages of writing. I also recommend The Hill Street Blues (1980's series) which introduced this kind of approach to the police work, but on a slightly different level. There is magic on TV (Star Trek-TNG quality if you like), and it can be seen in NCIS."
100,"I really love this show and would like to point out to shellemk that it is shown all over the United Kingdom (on the FX channel), NOT just in England! Shellemk, I would also like to remind you that television wouldn't even exist if it weren't for a Scot by the name of John Logie Baird. This is something that really irritates me. I am sick and tired of people thinking that everything pertaining to Britain is English. I know this isn't exactly the place to be talking about this, but I will submit a proper review for NCIS later on. And a reminder to everybody reading this, the United Kingdom is made up of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England. It isn't solely comprised of just one of those nations. Thank you for your time."
101,The constant stupid behavior of Tony and the borderline sexual harassment behavior of the two characters is becoming OLD!!!. The initial two seasons had good stories and great plots but recently the Tony and ZIVA show is turning me and many of my friends off. How about a more realistic behavior from these two? Do the writers really feel the type of actions these two provide would be tolerated in the work place. You are taking much to much liberty with the constant interplay and making Tony look like a fool. He may not be the brightest bulb on the tree but sooner or later he needs to grow into a more professional agent. How about this? Have him get accused of sexual harassment by an employee of NCIS who finds his behavior offensive then that would be more realistic than a slap in the head from Gibbs.
102,"I used to be a huge fan of the series. I thought she was good until the end of season 13, after which I found it just ok. I think it's enough of this series. Unfortunately, most of the great figures are no longer in the series. I just lack that certain something that is unfortunately no longer available. That's why I think it's time to say goodbye. Of course that's just my opinion but the series is getting annoying. Sorry!"
103,"Gibbs and ducky see a war stick on tv. That's the description of tonight's terrible episode. Wtf is a war stick? Google it, it's made up. Luckily, hot topic pig found a nappy headed hoe to make the story even worse. You have to be a super old sad idiot to like this trash."
104,"After 11 years of NCIS and now going into the 12th why does everybody on the team who gives Gibbs a report or information need to ""waffle on"" about how they got the information? You would think by now they would just give Gibbs the information instead of being head slapped or have Gibbs yell at them.My second peeve is the unrealistic use of ""Coffee Cups"" or ""Caf-Pow"". The way the actors handle the cups it's obviously the cups are empty. As you can tell by sound they make hitting a surface and the way they ""drink"" from them. They should put water in them as this would make it more realistic."
105,"The first couple of seasons are great, with the chocking ending of season two finale ""Twilight"" as a specific high-point. Then the show stumbles a bit for a season or two, before it creates perhaps the best episodes and best entertainment you can find anywhere. But then it starts to slowly go downwards, and lately it is hardly watchable. There are two main faults with this show. Firstly it has gone on for too long. It is very apparent when you read the synopsis of each episode and you notice that 80% has basically been copy pasted. I mean, how many petty officer's and lieutenants can be murdered? Adding together the corpses from this show and there would hardly be anyone left to invade the next country U.S. want to destroy. Secondly the show is almost 100% propaganda, especially lately. The longer the show goes on, the more saluting the flag, all marines are heroes and U.S is always the good guy crap we see. There are plenty of episodes where I root for the ""villains"" because clearly they are in the right. The best part of the show are the characters. Great, amazing characters. Without them and great acting this show would have died a long time ago. At the end though, as a summation of all seasons, this is not a very good show. The last 3-4 season has been to fill up and make money. There are very few good stories left, and even the acting has gone down. Perhaps it is a 5 in total, but I subtract two additional points for the blatant and in-your-face propaganda which is just ridiculous. If you watch this and feel like a proud American or you want to join the military to go overseas to slaughter the innocent, then this show is for you, thinking people and adults should however stay away."
106,"I think Ziva , Tony and Abby shud be back.
Ziva and Tony shud be in DC with their daughter.
Love watching it. In a matter of months I saw each and every episode."
107,"Standard network potboiler that has been on the air far too long. Now, with the loss of Abby (Pauley Perrette), this will be the final nail in the coffin for us.Ratings remain good, but only because there really isn't anything else to watch in that time slot for those without options. Truly, there is so much to choose from that, providing you wish to spend the money, there is no limit (if you merely wish to bury bombs, there is no limit to their size - Dr. Strangelove.)"
108,"Always admired how new cast members work well, however, to me Torres and Quinn don't work well with the team. Reeves works well. Torres and Quinn result in too many team members. Much prefer the dynamics between McGee, Bishop and Reeves with the rest of the team. Story lines have been weaker trying to work in Torres and Quinn. Plot lines with Reeves have been good."
109,"For many early years it was a 10 plus and I looked forward to them so much that I bought them in from America as soon as the US DVD set was available No more. They've lost the sharp plots and mysteries that made them special and traded in the original funny dialogue.Sadly the weaknesses in the series was transferred and amplified in some dire copies (NCIS Los Angeles) You may be one who continues to love the series, but why? These dips into ""character plots"" have been generally self indulgent and pointless and the repetition of almost identical comedy routines and faux loveliness between colleagues is now so forced and stale that I often just don't bother watching.My only hope is that the trailers for the next series looked promising, but I seriously doubt that this production team have effective change in them. The swings of false emotion are just wearing and that production change a few years ago intended to strengthen characters didn't do that for me at all. In fact it often seems self indulgent and false in terms of the team. Abbie suddenly has a beloved brother turn up (literally in the air) Jethro and his father is tiresomely hunted (again). What happened to exciting action and needing to think about who done it and why they did it? Such a comparatively ""muscle"" show running on empty for a long time now. SO sad."
110,"I have been a loyal fan of NCIS from the very beginning. I've always enjoyed the show and thought the writing was great and the characters were believable.I am very disappointed with this season's cast changes. I would definitely like character Anthony DiNozzo to return. The last story with an agent to be loved with another ""new"" agent brother of a Muslim terrorist is not nice. This agent is a boy and a possible new terrorist not a lover.I think that to make scenarios for propaganda are not good always. Sorry but i think that the series are not promising for the future. Maybe the chemistry will improve as the season progresses, but so far (9 episodes into season 15) it just isn't working for me."
111,"Probably the only show I enjoy watching on Wednesday nights, and one of my favourite drama/crime shows of all time. Although sometimes the endings are a little confusing, I love the chemistry between the characters and the dry humour in the show. Abby is probably one of the best characters, but I love Ducky (who talks to the victims), Tony (silly and naive but funny) and Gibbs as well. I will miss the playful interactions between Tony and Caitlin though. They were the best parts of seasons one and two.NCIS offers an insight into forensics (like CSI and its spin-offs), incorporates America's military dilemmas within it (Islamic Militants, the war in Iraq etc) but is full of sparking fun and comic edges. I highly recommend it to all"
112,"I absolutely love this show. It is the only T.V. show that I will never miss because I love it so much. I love all the characters and I love all of the humor used in the show. Abby is my favorite character, she's not your ordinary person you would expect to work for NCIS and I love that. Gibbs is a great character too, he seems very cold on the outside but you can tell that deep inside he really cares about everyone on his team very deeply. The first time I watched this show I was flipping through the channels and it looked interesting so I watched it and I have been hooked on it ever since and have never missed an episode. I would recommend this anyone who enjoys any kind of crime shows."
113,"I was a die-hard JAG fan. When it ended, I was saddened and unsure which show would take JAG's place in my heart. NCIS (originally titled Navy NCIS) appeared as a spin off of one of the shows in JAG's final season. I love NCIS because it is a very ""figure it out"" show with out all the blood and gore of CSI. Plus, I love almost anything present day military, so NCIS is right up my alley. The biggest thing that won me over with NCIS was, like JAG, the show isn't driven by the things that happen to the characters but more about how they handle the issues and relate to each other to solve the problems. If you liked JAG, NCIS may become your new favorite show, too."
114,"I live in Australia and watch this show every week. Mark Harmon or whatever his name is plays Gibbs really well and Michael Weatherly is the perfect actor for the roll of DiNozzo. Sasha Alexander, who plays Agent Caitlin Todd, does a great job of portraying her characters professionalism and rivalry with Agent DiNozzo. All of the actors make their characters interesting. Micheal Weatherly plays his character so well that makes the show a whole lot better with his witty remarks. The plot lines of the show are always entertaining, interesting and most importantly original. Every episode of NCIS contains a great and always unpredictable conclusion. The show is great if you like the whole investigative genre. If you enjoy other shows like JAG, CSI or Law and Order then you should definitely watch NCIS.Overall - 9/10"
115,"I watched a few episodes of this programme and increasingly found that by the end of the episode I wished I'd never bothered.When I first watched it I felt that the characters had promise, which is why I watched a few more episodes. Also there isn't too much on Australian TV on a Tuesday night! I soon realised that nothing was going to improve. The programme just has nothing innovative about it. I think the characters are wasted with very pointless clichéd story lines that wind up far too quickly and conveniently at the end. I don't think the writers are even trying. How did this programme have 4 series?!Don't bother watching it!"
116,Navy NCIS is the best show on CBS. I looked forward to Tuesday night so I could relax and watch a great show. The cast is terrific or should I say it was. Killing off Kate ruined this show for me. Whoever thought getting rid of a regular should have known it would lose viewers. I for one don't know if I will be watching this show next season. The cast worked so great together but with one missing something will just be gone from the show. I really liked the way all the characters worked off each other and I just can't see that working now. If a great final show was needed why not come up with something better than this! I hope they know they ruined another Tuesday night.
117,"In the beginning I couldn't stand Kate and almost stopped watching the show but Tony Denozzos character kept me watching. He made this show funny not just a detective show. Also Abby is such an interesting character, her dark sense of humor and personality is so fun to watch! So I enjoyed watching the show after Kate left and up until Abby left.. the show has unique characters that made this show great but now that the most interesting and fun ones are gone, the show has gone to predictable and boring..."
118,"It's great to watch a show, that is purely story based, no agenda. Very rare these days. Apart from the mandatory dead body, it's very clean, no bad language or nudity."
119,"I rated this on season 3...Now season 17 just started and I would give it a 5...the show is not my favorite NCIS anymore. Once Abby was gone I didn't watch it any more. I can't stand Bishop and Torris I don't really have any feeling for that actor..don't even get me started about the new lab character. She acts too goofy and weird. I still love Tim but Gibbs doesn't act like Gibbs. The stories don't hold up either...I just don't watch it now but, I have it playing in the background when I am on my laptop. This first episode of season 17 was good only because Ziva came back to the show..I probably will watch the 4 episodes that she will be in and after that will go back to not watching it..I just feel 17 seasons now and that the show has just run out of steam....."
120,"The scrawny blonde has to go. She's just plain weird and her hair is always a mess. The hispanic guy is a worse Tony than Tony. Why do they feel the need to include a classic, male pig? I'd fire him in the first 10 seconds. The new lab tech has a mouth the size of Texas. If she'd keep it closed, fine, but that's all I can see when she's on the screen. BIG MOUTH. Close it! Jeez. The worst actor on TV. And Gibbs. Has the guy EVER smiled? He's always, always, always negative. He's a raging maniac. If there's a murder, he screams at everyone to get busy. THIS murder is more important than all the others, he screams. No eating, no sleeping, no anything until this murder is solved. Speed isn't going to solve a murder. And, getting it done today isn't any better than getting it done tomorrow. The show could function just fine without him. Then, he gets conflicted about killing the murderer of his family. What an idiot. Abby was an insecure mess. Doofus can't figure out if he's fat or skinny. This show IS NOT as good as people think. The personal interactions suck. Gibbs sucks. The doc is great. The best actor on the show. Stop talking to dead people. The scrawny blonde talking, or writing, to a dead president was the stupidest thing I've ever seen on TV. It took a real moron to come up with that and even worse morons to put it on the air. WHEN PEOPLE DIE, THEIR EYES CLOSE!!!! Idiots.It's very obvious from watching Gibbs that he doesn't know anything about woodworking. He was using a plane on a rib on the boat. No one would ever do that."
121,"It's really very sad in my country that there is no lawyer and interrogator in the presence of a lawyer. With the culture of the American series that tells the government officials before arresting what they say is used against you in court and claiming the right to have a lawyer ... At the same time, the culture of this first human right opened up in the Iranian society ... Unfortunately, in this series, I have no way of avoiding this statement, and even during the time of detention, I have been ignoring the request for a lawyer. And it's a pity that, for years in the series, you were creating these two public rights ... American ... But now they simply step on the episode and go through it in vain"
122,I lost interest after Tony left and they added two new members to the team. I feel like they lost the best part of the show and they tried to replace him with two people but this just made the team feel too large.
123,"Having been a avid viewer of ncis from the start I've thought the show was amazing the chemistry that the crew had was amazing. first Kate then ziva finally dinozzo. I thought it wouldn't work and I think I'm right bishop ,quinn, torres,just don't gel well at all McGee is McGee Abby and ducky are the only characters that still act the same as for Leroy Jethro Gibbs he has lost the edge he had turning him into a soft character just does not work Gibbs character was hard never apologies that stare but it's all going slowly but surely bring back the old Gibbs or the show will die cos the rest can't carry it ."
124,"This is absolutely one of the best shows ever. From the stories to the actors portraying the characters you could not ask for better.Although I'm not to wild about the arrival of Lauren Holly as Gibb's former love interest, I hope the writers continue to concentrate on great story lines available and don't succumb to the romance plot. That seems to be the ""Kiss of Death"" for programs that are as good as this.Was sorry to see Kate go, but Ziva seems to be holding her own. Not to mention the outstanding job that Abby & Ducky come through with week after week!!I just hope seasons 1 & 2 come out soon on DVD! Executive Producers are you listening$$$$"
125,"I new Mossad agent name Zeta hav totally destroyed this serie, she is highly respected by all the NCIS agents, treated like a hero and can perform any stunt she want on American soil. Just ridiculous nonsense every time she shows up with her problems."
126,"To be honest, sometimes I'm confused on how this is consistently one of the highest viewed programs on TV. The writing is okay, sometimes a tad melodramatic. There are always a few sleepy episodes a season, but you know, it's easy to skip them and stay abreast of the overall story lines. However, what makes this show work and keep me watching the non- sleepy episodes are the actors and the way they gel together on the screen. Eventually, some of them will have to come and go as we've seen in other seasons, but the strength of casting is really what makes NCIS keep from being a rather stale ride. Despite each character fitting into a kind of stereotyped box, each actor finds a way to break the box. I don't always come back for the story lines so much as I come back to check up on the characters. I want to know how Gibbs is doing overcoming his issues. Is Duckie going to be taken for another ride by a woman with ulterior motives (well, more like will he NOT be taken for another ride because two was one too many)? How's Ziva's transition going (because it seems to still be happening)? And so forth. I want to know the end to these characters' stories. That is what makes NCIS a show I return to when it's not boring. That's its strength."
127,"This show is still the best show going in it's ninth season. I must admit that when they took Caitlin Todd off the show after season 2, I was afraid that the show wouldn't be the same. Enter Cote de Pablo as Ziva David. It's interesting to watch a South American play an Israeli. She is sexy and intimidating when she has to be. Her mistakes with American colloquialisms is just the right amount of humor to break the tension.McGee's growth over the years has also been refreshing and Abby is always fun to watch. I would like to see more episodes with Gibbs Dad as well as DiNozzo's Dad. We met McGee's sister, but what of his parents? This show needs to continue for many more years. I love watching repeats of this show on USA and I can't say that about any of the CSI shows."
128,"This show is by no means ""great"" or sweeping in its view. It isn't groundbreaking or original. But, where there are cons, there are pros.Pros: Solid writing, twisty plots, good suspense, solid character builds, and it has a knack for being funny and entertaining. I have never seen an episode that wasn't decent. That say's something about quality.Cons: Sometimes the plots can be derivative or questionable, never really gets edgy, characters, though well drawn, never get out of place. Can at times be a bit mundane.But, overall, I am sorry I put this show off for four years. It is usually entertaining.Recommended."
129,"O man I love this show I first watched it at the beginning of SERIES 2, it was Saturday and I wasn't going out anywhere, so I was flicking through the channels and i caught a glimpse of PAULEY PERRETTE'S character ABBY and i was like OMG she's so gorgeous and i watched it for the entire episode and became a devote fan, I have all the DVD's. its such a great show my friends constantly think its something like CSI rip off. and convinced that it is, and its silly because its such a great entertaining show. every character is likable from GIBBS, DUCKY, MCGEE, KATLIN(RIP), ZIVA and my two favourites ABBY & Denozo. thats one of the better things about this show, every character is likable and basically you got to watch the show yourself."
130,"there isn't much to say about ncis except that it is a perfect piece of crap, one of the worst shows i've ever seen in my whole life.. starting from the horrible soundtrack that gets on my nerves every time they play it.. i think the composer should get the prize of the best ""torture masterpiece"" on TV.. the characters are really dull, starting from the arrogant, antipathetic Mr knowitall Jethro Gibbs, to the dull sheepish McGee, the stupid, antipathetic DiNozzo, the freak Abby by the way there's always some freakish nerds in such shows who behind her weird looks hides exceptional genius and wit.. so classic! and so boring! the plot is far too simple almost childish, no suspense no real action, and full of clichés.. the principle character doesn't really do a damn thing, with a sick sense of humor, he just goes insulting people here and there showing what the show creators think is an exceptional power of character - the guy fears no one and behaves as if he were president of the United States (he perfectly fits in a context where Dubya is twice elected for president)and then all of a sudden, he miraculously finds the solution to the case!!! no effort, no logical proceeding, just like that! I have serious doubts about the taste of those who highly rated this show!!!"
131,"Ouch. We've watched every episode of NCIS for 16 years but something is going on that is taking the show in a direction we don't want to go.I don't know if it is the writing or the direction but the last two episodes (April 2019) are way out of character for the show. Instead of being down-to-earth straight forward dialog and story line something has shifted.I don't want to be specific to an episode which would come out as a spoiler. But the atmosphere of the show certainly has dropped a couple of levels recently. We gave up on NCIS New Orleans because they were a bit too flashy and lacked a certain level of plausibility. Now it seems NCIS is going down the same path.This has been my wife's favorite show for 16 years. We won't give up easily but I hope the producers get the message that the show is falling apart and we hope it returns to its regular ways. We want to get to the end of an episode and say, ""that was a good one,"" instead we are saying things like, ""that was odd."""
132,"I love this show, since the first episode. I was a big fan of Michael Wheatherly before and so I wanted to see him again. But I felt in love with the whole show. Especially Abby is a great role. It's funnier than CSI and more exciting than JAG. I want to watch more of these series. I wished to be like Abby without the caffeine shock I wished to be like Tony without the greasy hair I wished to be like Gibbs without the bad mood I wished to be like Kate without being dead I wished to be like Ziva without mixing up words I wished to be like Tim without getting hurt of Gibbs. I am saluting for the producers and I give the order to make more of that!"
133,"I love this TV series !The plot is great and the characters are fantastic !The rivalry between Tony DiNozzo and Kate Todd is just hilarious ! Gibbs is absolutely awesome in serious - but sarcastic - boss and the poor McGee is so funny too ! I also like Ducky and Abby, who are so strange and funny ! To sum up, it's a great show, which combine thriller and hilarious moments. Wonderful result ! I hope it will go on like this !A few bad things however: this show makes a bit too much the apology of the US Navy and it's a shame that Kate died at the end of Season 2... There isn't the same magic with Ziva David, who is a Mossad agent, which shows this series' position in the Israelo-Palestinian conflict... It's debatable... But these are the only things which aren't perfect !"
134,"This t.v. show is excellent, it's one of my favorites. Everything about it is excellent, acting, characters, story lines, plots, production, costumes, photography, directing, script and expression. Although, I like everyone on the show my favorite character is Abby.My favorite episode is the one when that brutal vicious, monster killer, Kyle Boone was executed. He deserved to be killed after all the horrible things he did. My biggest question is, why would he keep the locations of his victims' bodies a secret for so long? How could he not just tell them and let their families bury them and have closure? He kept everyone in so much pain.Kudos to the cast, crew and filmmakers. 10 out of 10 stars. Two Thumbs Way Up!"
135,"Being a fan of ""JAG"" and its topical stories, I knew that this show couldn't be that bad, but due to my work schedule wasn't able to watch it when the first season debuted. I finally got around to catching this show in early 04 and have been watching it ever since. I thought that ""CSI"" and its many versions was great--but ""NCIS"" is The Best! The chemistry between all characters is sooo real. ""CSI"" doesn't have that feel to me. Wonder what the next season will hold now that Kate is gone. Are we to see a more obsessed Gibbs, like he was before they found out who Ari was?! I hope so! And I hope they finally track down and kill that bastard Ari"
136,"I have seen several ""cop-based"" shows from ""Hillstreet Blues(no I'm not that old;just twenty-eight here...saw the reruns) to ""The Sentinel"" from UPN, but this show was somewhat different. I mean it has the usual victim/criminal/cop element, but it also has what some of the other shows have....humor. I mean, Toney Denoso(something like that..anyway) is a riot and Abby is really cool. Even Mark Harmon's character of Gibbs is his moments. It doesn't have the s/f/x that CSI has and it may not have big-breasted drop-dead gorgeous women like some of these prime-time dramas may have-though Sasha Alexander comes very close to hot....for a cop-but those things don't really make good TV watching anyway. So give the show a try, you won't be disappointed.Later...."
137,"At first I only watched NCIS because of David McCallum (loved him in Man from UNCLE) and Mark Harmon. But I love all the characters equally now. They all do such a good job in their roles and interaction with each other. The only negative is the reruns every other week. This show is the highlight of my week. I hope they continue NCIS for a long time to come. I especially had to laugh when Kate asked Gibbs who Ducky looked like when he was younger and the response was Ilya Kuriakin. That was excellent!! It is definitely one of the best shows on TV. The actors keep the characters interesting with the different quirks and people really act like they do when they work together, so it is very believable. Mark Harmon as Jethro Gibbs does a great job as the boss who knows everything. Another standout episode was the one when Gibbs team had counterparts in another police team they were working with. One was like Gibbs, one like Tony, one like Kate, etc. Once you watch this show you will tune in every week."
138,"Never watched a full episode, never will. Goth tattooed chick is a forensics ""genius"" in between hepatitis shots. Smart ass pretty boy gets beat up, but never looses any teeth. Non-British actors attempts playing nerdy pathologist, who acts like a lost chi-mo in the park. Then they parade a bugged-eyed monkey in a suit out to spit and sputter for some levity. All characters are simply ""characters,"" faking their way through the next commercial. Zero story with even less ""acting."" But not near as bad as the Los Angeles spin off with the midget and Tu Pac licking his lips constantly. Whoever writes these CBS jewels never graduated high school. The truth hurts ratings sometimes, but NCIS stands for Nothing Can Interest Stupidity."
139,"Five Stars because this was once a 10 but is now a 1. This review is for the whole show which started marvelously with great writing, great actors, and intriguing stories. But is is ending up like those 30,000 pounds of mashed bananas.
Somewhere back when Ziva David went AWOL but before they blew her to smithereens and off the horizon of ever making a return appearance, NCIS began it's slow but steady decline into mediocrity. In the background we began to imagine that we were listening to Harry Chapin singing his hit song, ""30,000 Pounds of Bananas."" It ends with words similar to this.""Just imagine sixteen seasons mashed at the bottom of the grade. Yes, there have been sixteen seasons of NCIS spoiled by crew infighting, back biting and bad writing. Sixteen season now empty of entertainment. Just sixteen seasons to mashed into dreary, silly, story lines and cheap antics.No decent creative writers left, no skilled directors, and angry bitter executive producers seemed to be all that was left.So now you know how we feel about a favorite show that has gone long in the tooth and bald on the top with wispy untamed hair hanging down about its shoulders.Why? Because as bad as it was to lose Kate with a bullet in her forehead, the show was rescued by Ziva David's excellent role. Not just gorgeous, Cote de Pablo knew how to craft that character of a Mosad agent turned US citizen and federal agent into a lovable sharp edge. No wonder she wanted off around season thirteen. She saw the wave coming. The wave that was about to wash the show out. But, it hung in there for a bit as long as Anthony Jr. was around. But Michael was meant for bigger things than a McProd for McGee. Sadly without Ziva and then Dinozo, McGee lost his keel and rudder and began to drift aimlessly through the show's stories. Some of the multi-parts remained good - like the trip to Paraguay and its rescue first of children then of Gibbs and McGee. That was the old NCIS flashing back brilliantly.The problem became how to replace Ziva and Tony. They never did succeed for Ziva until they brought Agent Jack Sloane on. 'Bish' weakly played by Emily Wickersham never gelled as a character. She started out as a wannabe and remained a wannabe no matter how much seasoning she had. She had no depth given to her character and no strength. Even when given the helm at Gibbs absence we do not actually see her in command or managing the team - only that Gibbs tells her how wonderfully she did. (No wonder Cote de Pablo wanted out claiming they were not developing stories that gave her a challenge).So Bish the Blond, looking like a preppy co-ed bounced around bumping first into Tony, then McGee, then Gibbs and the others. But somehow she lasted with her mediocre performances, she hung in there as Bishop and Emily was happy to have the work on a popular show.But then Tony was gone and on came Nick who could be great when called upon to do it but the character had two personalities. One was the kick-butts and don't take names Nick, and the other was the uncomfortable unhappy Nick who wore tight shirts, didn't like the NCIS jacket or cap and didn't like sitting down at his desk so he stood up all the time. Really? Who's idea was that - at least get him one of those elevated desks huh? He was just out of place, a utility players who did not have a position on the team but was called upon to be macho undercover tough.
We can't ignore the underdeveloped Palmer who became Dr. Palmer and began to carry the heaver end of the autopsy load so Ducky David McCallum (as old as he is) didn't have to work so hard. Ducky is the only character that was never messed with and remained truly enjoyable. Well, Abbs too, but she wore us out with the Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs...about 2,000 times too many.But Palmer? Why could they not let that pansy grow a pair and stop irritating Gibbs every time he opened his mouth. The few time they called on him for heroic acts he did great but otherwise they gave him lame and stupid jokes so that Gibbs could give him the Gibbs demon stare of disdain.Mark Harmon lost interest in maintaining the mysterious Gibbs and he began to mess with the character so much that the character lost focus. At odds with Nick and Jimmy much of the time because of their personality antics and in a constant turf battle with 'zee' Director Vance, it seems that Gibbs should have been the next to go. The character lost his magic around the time Anthony D. wondered off the set with his Mini-Ziva. He had bigger Bullrings to do battle in.Director Vance was a thorn in the side of the whole show. With increasing envy of the fun and games a floor below that Gibbs was having, this Director of how many NCIS stations around the country? New Orleans, Los Angeles and others alluded to, he sure took time to focus on the D.C. team a lot. I'm sure King Pride was happy with that. They brought Vance in to have someone Gibbs could not own but he couldn't bond with or trust either. Vance the micro-manager made the show really tedious more and more tedious as he never could win with Gibbs. The series between 15 and 16 where Vance is kidnapped was a near comic parody of what the show should have been.And then we have Abby. The character has so much going for her except she was just over the top a little bit too often and seemed to need to be catching up too often to what was really happening. The personality clash between Mark and Paulie destroyed a key enjoyable element and should never have been allowed to fester a whole season. Kill off one or the other and move on with a better replacement.Ummm I wonder how the show would have worked with Jack Sloan taking over as Team Leader instead of sideline shrink.The departure of Abby was pathetic melodrama. Paulie put too much of her self into the Abby character. What did we get instead? We got someone from a young teen detective show that might run after school in the afternoon. Whoever on the writers team that created Kasie Hines to be this caricature of Abby failed badly. Honestly she was from ""Saved by the Bell"" or ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" genre. That is all I can stomach to say about this very weird character. She was much better when she was Ducky assistant helping him finish his book. It is my guess when Paulie announced her departure, they just grabbed Diona Reasonover and said, ""Here, you can do this, just act kooky most of the time but always produce the nuggets of evidence the team needs. It's the kooky direction that needed to be left off the set. We really didn't need to replace Abby with someone trying to be Abby. Kasie could have developed into a professional rather than a scatterbrain stumbling over her words and emoting way too much on the dark side. I mean really, another Abby? There never was going to be another Abby. Even Sebastian is not another Abby in spite of how much they try to make him so. If Dona is a good actor, and I expect she is, We'll have to see her in a different part to know. Here she isn't but that was the direction more than the actor.And so at the end of season sixteen the show is all mashed up like Harry Chapin's 30,000 pounds of bananas and without any clear identity left. If they go to seventeen it will be because of greed and I vote for some malcontent to come in and kidnap half the cast, all the crew and leave the rest to decay for a while before Jimmy comes up from Autopsy and discovers all the bodies and the nuked office. Like a Blast From the Past. Or the walking NCIS dead zombie spin off...it couldn't be worse than it has become. Oh my, the first 13 seasons were good. The lasts three, dismal. Sorry, that how I see it."
140,"I enjoy this show mostly for the laughs. I wished I had watched it from the start. 
I actually watched Bull w/ Michael Weatherly and did not really care about NCIS enough to try it.
Then after checking out the stars in all the NCIS shows, I saw that Lucas Black was in NCIS /New Orleans. That is where I started and watched a few seasons and then also started watching NCIS-LA, and season 2 got me hooked because of the funny parts. I watched about 3 seasons of that and finally decided to watch NCIS. Now it is hard to go back to watching the other NCIS' cause they aren't funny enough.
I know it is far from any kind of reality, but I am not watching for that reason.
I love seeing the computers and the cellphones that were NEW back then. To see Abby get so excited about the things she can do on those old computers is hilarious. I am in S3 E12, so I have a long way to go, but it will be fun to see the changes in technology along the way."
141,"This year hit the fans of Ncis , with the most awful news! well, that is if you are a fan of Michael Weatherly who plays Tony Denozzo in the series. Ncis,is by far the most brilliant show i have watched and it grew on to me , thanks to Michael Weatherly , with him quitting the show is like watching your favorite rose die or loose its petals!i just can't imagine the show without his hysterical comments , his funny nicknames for McGee, his movie referrals ,his really bad eating habits or flirtatious habits oh and the smacks that were so felt by us fans. I just know NCIS will never be the same again , I am not really looking forward to it, will miss you , Very special agent Tony Denozzo ....sniff sniff"
142,did any one else notice Abby's wardrobe...pink lipstick..light eye shadow...no dog collar but a nice girlie necklace..a nice v neck top..no dog collar rings...she was noticeably not goth at the end of the episode....i am anxious to see if this is going to continue....this was the episode where she went had to find what that scientist was working on...very good episode...a good showcase for Abby..does any one have any background on her...and her relationship with Gibbs...where did she come from...she and Gibbs are very close...i like the dynamic between them...well all of them...this is a very good ensemble show...i do hope this is not cancelled..but syndication sure keeps us our Gibbs fix..I also like the shows with Ziva more than i do with Kate...Kate was good..but Ziva is a better fit...and i do like the warrior in her...and loyalty to the team...
143,"Where can I find this on TV again? We noticed they took channel 7 off in our line up of programs. We can't seem to find where they sent all our favorite programs to. I love the way they set up the plot and all the crime scene information. Smacking Tony on the head is kinda getting boring , but, it seems to be more of an affectionate smack now. My husband and I love this show. Abbey is our favorite. This girl seems to know everything about everything. She is so pretty too! We love the plots. Ducky rocks! McGee is sweet, and he is such a gentleman. Gibbs is so know it all and cool. Zeba is so wonderfully strong. Director is gorgeous. And, Tony, Macho Male to the T!"
144,"This is the best series I ever saw, Except then when agent Caitlin Todd died :(. I think this was the first series I followed good (mean that I watched everything) And in the last episodes in season 2 it was really dramatic. The actor Mark Harmon ( Agent Gibbs ) is ex marine Who haves a great instinct The actors Micheal Weatherly ( Agent DiNozzo ), Sasha Alexander ( Agent Todd ) and Sean Murray ( Agent McGee ) Are funny Todd and DiNozzo always blackmails each other or DiNozzo looks always in to the privacy of Todd and DiNozzo always fools around with McGee. It is really a funny TV series you really need to watch it.Its dramatic and funny so buy the seasons :P"
145,"I think this an excellent program, the power of this show is not the visuals (CSI looks 'smoother, cooler') but the characters really work great together. All very different people, but with a magical chemistry between them. I personally very much like the character of Abby, and the interaction between DiNozzo and Todd (I know she isn't in the series anymore. but we here in the Netherlands haven't got to that point yet). All in all it is one of my favorite shows, and it sure as hell beats CSI, if you ask me, but then again ""its a matter of taste"".The fact that it focuses only on the 'naval criminal investigations' maybe limiting the possibilities of where the producers can go with the show, without going 'over the top'. Then again, if you were to let the show be about any sort of murders, on any place they might also be tempted to go over the top. Lots of things to think about, and enough things to there may be wrong or weird about this show, but the chemistry works. And it is that working chemistry that I think makes a good show."
146,"I think this show is fair, but is not number 1 worthy ! The plot is somewhat dry and at times predictable! And the scripting is not much better . I mean how many witty one liners can a person stand in an hour? Seriously and yet it is declared the best drama on TV! I don't get it , if I wanted to see head smacking and sarcastic remarks . I would watch the 3 Stooges, but if I want to see a an actual decent drama. I would watch either CSI NY, Criminal minds or Person of interest. But if I want fart acting and banter this would be the show for me! And worthless movie trivia that has nothing to do with the crime. In which they are trying to solve! This good drama how ? Ten years of what adults who act like children. Who pretend to act like adults!"
147,"Is Caitlin really dead, some ways to bring her back? 1. Repeat last five minutes when she's shot. Tony wakes up calling Kate's name. Kate rushes to his side and we find them still in the sick bay. Kate's death was all a fever driven nightmare.2. Next season the team learns that just before the last episode the real Kate was kidnapped and replaced with a double.3. Ducky arrives on the scene and finds a faint pulse. At the hospital we learn in a million to one shot the bullet didn't due any fatal damage. Not being a doctor, I have no idea if this is possible considering the bullet passed through her head. Tony and Gibbs were lucky the bullet didn't hit them since they were standing in front of her.4. Kate's twin sister, Katherine, joins the group and reveals she was the one in the wet t-shirt contest. The new Kate now sexually harasses Tony.5. An old girl friend of Tony's learns of Kate's fate and that Tony on some level loved her. She undergoes plastic surgery and emerges as Kate's double.Not being a sci-fi story we can rule out brain transplants, cloning and doubles from parallel worlds."
148,"The show is excellent. I am a fan, but I am this close to stop watching it because of the character DiNozzo. He would never make it to his position in real life. First off, he would have been brought up on sexual harassment charges after the first episode. He acts like a 9th grader..not even a college frat boy. I don't find him charming or amusing...just inane. He ruins the show for me.The real NCIS would never hire this sophomoric jerk. I beg of the producers to tone Tony down, a lot. Shawn Weatherly is a doll. I don't know how he can stomach playing this character. The way he rides ""Probie"" is so unprofessional that I wish he would pop Tony in his stupid smirk.Anybody out there agree?"
149,"I realize that this show has been the subject of some bad reviews due to unrealistic characters. To be honest, the characters are all a bit exaggerated, but that's the fun of it. Many people turn away from the show because they think the characters are unrealistic or because they're too much, but what I absolutely love is that they have created these unique, funny, sorta unbelievable group of people and given each one a backstory and vulnerabilities. Even more important, we also see plenty of character development as the seasons progress and we occasionally get the treat of learning about someone's backstory. The trick to enjoying this show is to watch plenty of episodes so you can really start loving the characters. Gibbs is a man of few words. He's arrogant, stubborn, and stern, but you can tell he cares. He would give his life for anyone on the team and do all he can to solve each and every case. We later learn that he has a very troubling backstory that led him to become an agent. We also have Dinozzo. He's a total goofball, and an immature playboy. But he's actually very complex, and as the seasons progress, you see him take less and less pleasure in meaningless one-night stands and other affairs. You can even see it in his expression when other's aren't looking. We see most of these vulnerable moments when he's with agent David, who he has clear chemistry with. Agent Ziva David is a beautiful, deadly Mossad officer who has been with the team for most of the show. From her first appearance, she has been a joy to watch on-screen she never fails to make other slightly uneasy. She's the best fighter the team has, and one of the bolder characters. She's also my favorite because of how astonishingly she has evolved since her first season. Different events have changed her and she's closer to the team than ever, she's a grown a bit soft, but is much more mature and ""Americanized."" Next we have the adorable McGee who is the innocent ""probie."" He's a capable, smart agent, yet he is often the source of many teases because he's a bit awkward and shy. However, watching him stand up for himself or win out in an argument is always very satisfying. We also have Abby, the goth forensic scientist. She's not realistic. She's a bit much. However, she can only provide laughs and love from the audience. She's incredibly smart and independent, not to mention sensitive. But, she's the best of the best, and also hilarious. Lastly, we have Ducky and Palmer. The pair are quite different, Ducky being old, mature, and caring. Meanwhile, Palmer is his young assistant who often, accidentally, puts himself in awkward situations with some cheesy puns or badly timed jokes or comments, although he always means well. Overall, it's a delight to watch the cast interact with each other. There's a reason why this is the number one show in America. And the love the team subtly exhibits toward each other is great to watch. Not to mention it also has a few pairings that fans will be more than happy to ship. It is quite obvious that Mcgee and Abby like each other. And Tony and Ziva have the most beautiful, complex relationship I have ever seen on TV and they could easily run the show by themselves. The only regrets you might have from watching this, is being unable to stop."
150,"After seeing some of the rave reviews, I wonder if the reviewers have watched recent seasons. The longer the show goes on, the more annoying I find Tony DiNozzo's character. I *loved* the actor & his character on ""Dark Angel"", so I have a lot of respect for his acting skill since he's so convincingly portraying a total MCP jerk... I just wonder why DiNozzo's female co-workers never filed sexual-harassment suits, and why Gibbs allows him to bully the lower-ranked guy. The interpersonal interactions seem more realistic for some WB high-school comedy than for a law-enforcement agency supposedly staffed by responsible adults.Why do I keep watching? Because Gibbs is okay, Dr. ""Ducky"" Mallard's a gem, and Abby *rocks*. Oh, and I'm waiting to see if Tony ""comes out of the closet"": I figure such obnoxiously in-your-face macho posturing has gotta be overcompensation for his unacknowledged homosexuality. :-) Unfortunately, I doubt the writers/creators of this show are imaginative enough to have this plan behind Tony's ""pig"" characterization."
151,"Too often the writers sensationalize on the dirt of our society. Last night's episode of NCIS made me proud to be a military member and relive a hero's war experience.This last show gave the characters more compassion depth to their stage personalities than any show in the last two years of viewing. KUDOS to the writer. I would like to see your writers do more of this type of story line. I support the Belarsarios programs and watch all of them. But this episode was by far the best. Could you pass on the negative ""slap on the back of the head"" that Gibbs does to DeNoso then he does it to McGee. This sends a negative aggressive behavior to our youth and is unacceptable. On another note, I am pleased to see a Marine General at the helm of JAG. Keep up the good stories. Chief Shabo"
152,"This was a great series. I am using past tense very consciously! In the current series it appears that the writers have lost the character profiles. I don't think I missed an episode until now, BUT! I am about to drop it as the quality of script and direction has dropped off to an average series standard.While each individual writer is inventing their own twists and turns the overall character development has gone in all directions. The lack of script coherence is showing in the quality of acting and direction since understandably if the character profile is nebulous even the best actor and director doesn't know what to do with it.Definitely a series that has gone past its prime."
153,"My husband and I have enjoyed NCIS from the beginning--wouldn't miss an episode right up till Ari killed Kate! Then we happened to miss the first couple of episodes (a 2-parter, I understand) of the new season, and when we tried watching it this month, we saw a totally different ""animal""--not the one we signed on for! In the last couple of episodes, almost the entire hour is dedicated to a lot of stupid banter and silly horseplay between characters, especially DiNozzo and Ziva; Gibbs knocks people on the head even more than before; and barely a few minutes mostly toward the end of the hour comes a very slight mystery and solution, nothing challenging or special anymore! Then there's all that stupid camera work! Those jerky shots, quick closeups, superfluous memory shots, etc., are totally tiresome and so-o-o last century! Apparently, the decision to kill Kate off when Sasha Alexander decided to leave the show prompted the wrong people to apply the old adage: ""If it ain't broke, fix it till it is!"" Well, it's very badly ""broke"" now, and it is about to lose a couple of loyal fans! Debbie Jordan www.imaginetheworldatpeace.com"
154,"The series was fun to watch at first but then it became too silly at times. When Abby runs in shouting ""Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs"" is an example. It happens just too many times. Also that she has to be sort of bribed with some soft dink and Gibbs pecking her on the cheek now and then. Do professional people ever really act like that? One wonders.Anthony D. is so arrogant and all the immature things he does makes the show less and less enjoyable. I know that it is the people who write the scripts that are to blame so maybe somebody should have a talk with them. Tell them to grow up and write series that are more real and not just to create dramatic plots.Another thing one unfortunately sees in almost all such series is that when the so called good guys are about to apprehend a bad guy they shout his or her name from a distance. This gives the crook a running start. Of course this allows the TV team to film a chase that can be exciting to watch if not for the heads up that the good guys gave the crook. If this happens in real life then one can wonder how many innocent bystanders get hurt just because somebody could not keep his/her mouth shut. I would think that waiting till one is just next to the person they wish to capture would be a lot safer.Come on people the show could be really good if somebody checked with real law enforcement agencies about how they handle some of the stories that appear in the series. This is, along with the other NCIS shows, a mediocre TV series."
155,"My favorite was the one of Wonderful Ziva back in Israel and Tony finding her only to learn that she loves him. That tender moment in the grove where she buried some papers, the way they looked at each other, absent a kiss--I think--was so amazingly emotional. Tony's real wife musta been really ticked. I don't know how they kiss others who are not their spouse. But, that's just me.And the George Bush one, which I'm watching right now--well when I finish this--well, that looked and sounded sooooo much like Bush that I had to come and find out if he did a cameo. The relationships are the best part of the show."
156,"Something about the laconic Mark Harmon and his team at Naval Criminal Invesigation Service has caught the fancy of the television public. NCIS is still going strong after a decade.Interesting stories and characters does the trick for this series. Harmon who is a former Marine has got good instincts to ferret out the truth from people. He's aided by a team with different skills.Michael Weatherly is the number 2 of the unit. His background is civilian police more than military and he's a bit of a blowhard. In a sense Weatherly has the toughest acting job in the show because if he came at the 'probies' too hard the audience would hate him. Still he does make life miserable for Sean Murray especially in the early episodes.The need for computer skills in law enforcement has become critical but there is a prejudice against computer geeks that Weatherly shares. Poor Sean Murray was new to the team at the beginning and he was the butt of all of Weatherly's juvenile pranks. Still he stood up to it and the jokes got less and less.Weatherly was not about to pull anything with Cote DePablo, a former Israeli soldier. Out of necessity those people put and have kept their women at arms and she's no one to mess with.Two others are part of the team, the most unmilitary like. David McCallum whom I remember well as a teen idol of sorts as Ilya Kuryakin in The Man From UNCLE in the Sixties is a senior citizen now and the medical examiner. I wonder if he and Leslie Hendrix of the Law And Order franchise ever met at a Medical Examiner convention? They sure have the same style.But the most unmilitary person in the group, but maybe the most loved is Pauley Perrette as Abby Sciuto or ""Abs"" as everyone calls her. Given her Goth persona and a cheerful outlook on life which those folks seldom have, she's a strange person to be working in a military setting. But the team especially Harmon really love her and she's my main reason for watching the show.Other than some good stories and a fine ensemble cast."
157,"I simply can't resist watching this series.I would watch it non-stop,over and over and i would NEVER get bored or love it less.The characters:Gibbs,DiNozzo,Abby,Ziva,McGee,Ducky...every single one of them will captivate you,make you smile,laugh and cry while trying to find criminals and solve the mystery of how an innocent person was murdered.I don't want to write too much about NCIS TV series because in order to love it and to understand just how great it can be,you have to watch it for yourself...but i have to warn you that,once you start watching it,you will have a hard time stopping to do your daily chores...i bet you will simply love it.It's by far my favorite TV series and if it would be discontinued,my heart will sure be broken."
158,"Torres needs to go back to undercover work. Torres is so obnoxious. Bishop deserves someone a lot nicer. What about her high school bully? He seems interested in her. He's nice and handsome. Also, can Abbie's replacement tone it down a notch"
159,"I just heard that Michael Weatherly is leaving the show. No more Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo. This sucks. Any episode (other then including father DiNozzo) that showcased Tony's skills and experience were great episodes. I wanted more involving story lines like this. This is the beginning of the end for NCIS. It was always going to happen, everyone thought it would be Mark Harmon leaving. I am hoping for a team of his own and relocation for Tony. A death for this character seems in bad taste. Or maybe a reunion with Ziva. Anyways, the loss of this actor and character is huge. Moving forward without Tony DiNozzo will be a huge challenge for the show."
160,"Really great one, I remembered first seasons, live actions, live faces. fascinated views, unique scenario I didn't see anywhere else like colourful Halloween series, or thriller about radiation poisoned guy, or funny black-out series. As It may say, good old days..Heroes are charismatic, very good choice, everyone is like not play but actually live their characters.When you hear about navy you await to see ships, pirates, slavery traffic, treasure hunting, contrabandists, historic sails and romantic, sea and waves in common script. Hidden skeletons, secrets, lost people there out of beach. May be I do mistake with sea guard or how that it was, but it kinda still not expect instead a;; of this the bombs, terrorists, deal with world threats and all-world conspiracy. It's a little like fireman deals with I don't know emm gardening, or bomb squad goes remote cars. Not exactly what they should do, doesn't it.And when scenario goes that way, do accent on lovable by Americans boom and bam covered in sea uniform for excuse, NCIS lost its charm, specialty became a little dull. It's not NCIS anymore, it is some kind of Special Unit, should rename by the way. And now goes new season. Let's see."
161,"NCIS is very well done, and I love watching it on Saturday nights. Why? Because I like this sort of show, it interests me. What makes NCIS so watchable is that while it is nothing groundbreaking, it is strongly scripted, nicely plotted, well photographed, slickly directed, has some good acting particularly from Mark Harmon, has likable characters, has clever music and the character development is good. Some episodes might be slower than others, but the show is great to watch and I applaud it for doing something with a formula that is not that new anyway.Overall, NCIS is an interesting watch. If you have a free weekend evening, by all means sit down and put your feet up and your dinner and get engrossed. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
162,"Having just watched the latest episode of Navy NCIS - ""Marine Down"", I must say that I like this little spin-off of Bellisario's JAG. It is entertaining and both the pace and dialogue never get boring. I agree with almost all of the other comments that the show is in fact rather unrealistic. As a former, administratively discharged Marine officer, I definitely concur. Having been amid both a JAG and NCIS investigation, the officers and agents with whom I was acquainted and the offices from which they worked were nothing like the locales on either show, especially the glitzy and modern set of Navy NCIS. It's almost as futuristic and high-tech as Q's workshop in any James Bond movie. The set is definitely from the minds of Hollywood and goes far beyond the constraints of any federal budget. The last time I saw the inside of any NCIS office, the decor was drab, the ""Dilbert-esque"" cubicles were small and cramped, only about half of the computer terminals were working and the office coffeemaker kept the coffee at room temperature. Still, the show is entertaining. The characters mesh together well and the writing is passable. The characters of Abby (Pauley Perrette) Sciuto and Caitlyn (Sasha Alexander) Todd are both HOTTIES, if you can get past Abby's body art. But then, JAG has its share of babes too... Lt.Col. Sarah (Catherine Bell) Mackenzie, Lt.J.G. Meg Austin and LCdr. Tracy Minnetti to name a few. Never in my 16 years in the Corps had I seen so many GREAT looking women in uniform. In fact most of the uniformed hotties were among the enlisted ranks. But I digress. I still find both shows entertaining. OK, so it's not overly realistic. But if you want realism. go enlist. But if you want a chuckle from the semi-biting repartee between agents Todd and DiNozzo, the Gothic charm of nerdy Abby, the witty though mind-numbing stories of Ducky or the sardonic wit of the fatherly, Jethro Gibbs, watch the show."
163,"This is definitely the best tv show that I've ever seen, and will ever see."
164,The plot is very unique. Each character has their own skill set and a very distinct personality. Gibbs leads the team with a firm hand but is also a very soft and kind hearted man. NCIS is appropriate for 10+
165,"We have walked with this family of actors over all these years and it still amazes me how they capture the range of stories and emotion well,"
166,"Seasons 1-14 are AMAZING
After that it is still good, but the charm of DiNozzo and the charming abby are gone and it kinda sucks....but NCIS is always able to tell a story."
167,"This show is enjoyable except for Gibbs yawn-worthy character. I don't care about his boring past, just keep it there already. The show should be called ""Gibbs"".I wish all the characters had equal time because for me they are more interesting. They keep it where you dont know much about them, which makes me want to shove Gibbs out of the way, so I can see something compelling.Sometimes they focus on what the show is supposed to be about, Naval criminal investigation. As time goes on it focuses less and less on the subject matter... sigh"
168,"I miss when we have a Marine Gibbs,Tony,McGee,Kate & Ziva.Bishop is ok but not as good as Kate or Ziva.When Tony left it was a massive loss for the show,Gibbs may be the leading role,but Tony was the Center of the show.Its hurt to see Gibbs and McGee around a bunch of Cartoon.Please someone shoot that undercover macho or kick to NCIS LA where they are good at blowing up car, shooting people,he does not belong here."
169,"From JAG episode to 17 and counting Seasons . NCIS started off as very generic show with crime if the week that we saw thousands of times before only thing changed is that it surrounded the navy and the marines . But from season 3 the show changed the coming of Ziva the story about Gibs the better writing in its plots made NCIS standout. The other characters Ziva Tony Abby McGee Ducky were all interesting and made love NCIS more.
But from season 15 with the leaving of Ziva Toby and Abby it's not the same as it was it's not awful some episodes still standout but the new characters are pale compère To the old characters. Even the writing is not as it was ."
170,"The music theme really sucks but thanks to the mute button the show helps to overcome that flaw. Always found it funny when agents are having a subtle conversation amongst themselves and yet far in the distant in walks another ""team"" member getting in on the subject as if they were there all along."
171,"Has anyone else noticed the crazy number of redheads appearing as regulars, guest stars and extras? every episode seems to have at least one. for me, just another reason to love the show."
172,"I gave this show a 7 star review based on seasons 1 and 2 and the first 3 episodes of season 3.
The stories were great and I enjoyed trying to figure out who did what before the episode was over. The continuous talk about sex was a little much, got old fast, and was annoying. I took a star away just for that.
The forensics and medical examinations were interesting. Some things, of course, weren't realistic but Abby and Ducky were awesome characters. I loved Abby's goth thing she had going on and Ducky's stories were entertaining. Both were happy and chipper for the most part and made the show fun to watch.
Gibbs was also a good character. Serious, hardass, whether he was in the field or in the interrogation room. I liked his way of doing things.
Agent Todd's death was definitely unexpected and a serious loss to the show. The way she was seen by a few of her coworkers after her death was a little disturbing. It made Dinozzo and McGee seem very shallow and uninteresting characters after that. I took a star away for that. If Todd had been replaced by Cassidy, that would have been great. I personally didn't care much for Ziva. Also the NCIS director was replaced by a woman which I saw as a fail. A star lost for that.
After the 3rd episode of season 3, I just couldn't get into the show anymore. I could see this show going down a dark road after season 2. Some people may enjoy that but I don't. The show was ok for what it was in the first 2 seasons."
173,"This is a good show, on my top 3. Criminal Minds keeps being the best but this is a great backup. Brilliant characters, if you need to lose track of time I recommend trying this."
174,Is the writer ever going to let this guy start to mature. He's not the pretty face the writer would have us believe.
175,"I am amazed that this show gets such high figures. I watched it on and off through the last couple of years, each time expecting it to life up to it's fame, but it's is just a mediocre show with a weak script, only saved by the good cast, even though they play predictable characters. To illustrate this I give you an example of the episode I saw yesterday. Which is a showcase example of the ramshackle plot.Basically the story is this: two coffin's supposed to contain the bodies of two major's are brought back to the USA to be given proper burial. However one of the wife's claims that she has been phoned by her late husband a couple of days ago while she was told he died two weeks ago. The team then investigates this mystery and discovers that the two guys where working undercover in Columbia, where they where taken hostage. A ransom of 2 million was demanded, but the CIA guy who acted as the go between palmed it off. When he discovers that NCIS get's involved he tries to do something about it. After some issues NCIS finally are just in time to save one of the supposed-to-be-dead majors from a gruesome death and do the bad guys in.Now what is wrong with this?First of, the NCIS can't get into records of these guys. There is actually no reason why they can't because they would get this authority through a judicial injunction, just like the police get's a warrant to do a house search. Instead they use the pay checks to trace where these guys have been. So far for security. In the mean time the CIA bad guy does all sorts of unexplainable things. First he pretends to be the co in charge of the two major's trying to put of Gibbs. Then the CIA dude pretends to be one of the NCIS agents and goes to talk to the wife of one of the majors. What was he asking her? And how come he did know one of the name's of the NCIS investigators he had never met? How come he was so dumb to actually use the name of one, unless it was to draw them into a trap. But then it was a poor trap because he started running the moment Gibbs showed up. It's only purpose seems to be is to allow Gibbs to chase him and discover that he drive's off in a CIA car so he can make the connection with the CIA? And the way the connection is made with the CIA. It was because the CIA drove in an armored car! Then NCIS discovers one of the major's isn't in the coffin, so he might still be alive somewhere. Nobody in the army seems to even have checked that there where dead bodies in there until NCIS game along. How gullible everybody is according to the writers. Then there is the thing with the dead major being embalmed alive and so perfectly embalmed they can't establish the cause and moment of death at first. Why does it matter he was still alive unless to show how totally weird the embalmer(and CIA man?) must have been or to put the pressure on the team after they discover the other major was probably still alive? Besides how can someone be perfectly embalmed while trashing about in pain and without any sign of stress on his body(the second major was about to undergo the same treatment when NCIS burst in: he was very much alive). And why, after the investigation of the body, does the NCIS claim that the body was supposed to be investigated, while the CIA bad guy was so desperately trying to prevent them from investigating further?And why was the second major kept alive while the bad guy had already got the two million and both major's where accepted for being dead? Either both majors where captured someone other than the CIA man, or on behalf of the CIA man. If it was a band or gang then they where on holiday when the NCIS burst in as there was only the embalmer and the CIA man on the premises. It stands more to reason the CIA man hijacked the two on his own with the assistance of the embalmer(?). What use was the major to him after he got the money?And why, when NCIS discovers the major must be somewhere in Columbia, do they go of head over heels in a plane only armed with pistols, while the major might, for all they know, have been guarded by heavily armed gangsters. And who gave them the authority to operate in such a way on foreign soil without assistance of the local authorities or at least some local American commander. Off they rush with pistols on their own authority, because the NCIS will not be delayed by such things as international relationships and legal necessities. And then finally the major is liberated. Again this is a laugh. A second CIA is added to the crew and immediately you know it. It is as in star trek: he will buy it. They add one temporary guy who's only role is to be bumped off. And so he is.All in all the plot is much the same as a plot of the A team. While the A team is totally nuts without any pretense to seriousness, NCIS pretends to be a realistic series but actually hides the same sort of ridiculous nonsense. The only saving grace is the cast."
176,"Been watching NCIS since 2003 and have no complaints. You would think that being on the air for over 15 years the stories and characters would get stale. Not the case, the characters still surprise me and storylines are not recycled."
177,"The characters are so annoying, stupid and brainless. I have tried to watch it several times. but it just gets on my nerves. Honestly I do not want to spend an hour watching these desperate childish attention seeker characters, which somehow manage to solve the murders, as the bunch seems and looks not intelligent enough to solve anything...."
178,"I know nothing about police work, and, even less about NCIS and the Feds, but, I like this show as it's about the US Navy which I was once a part of. It's entertaining!This show is 'very representative' of the US Navy; much of the experiences I had in the US Navy; and, of the one time my friends and I had an encounter with an NIS (now called NCIS) Agent on board the USS Independence (CV-62) in 1987...WHOA!We were taking pictures like any 'boot-camps' on their first cruise at sea, and, suddenly, a helicopter came in close to us near the fantail as we still took pictures. I remember saying to my friends, ""Check this out, the helicopter is coming in close...this will make for great pictures!"" The helicopter was coming in closely because they thought that we might be taking pictures of the ordnance next to us; so, they radioed the ship, who sent the MAA out as NIS wished to speak with us.NIS was cool! They weren't bullies like civilian cops...they were very professional! They questioned us, and, that was that! No one was threatened or intimidated; and, they didn't take our cameras.So...this is why I believe this TV show to be realistic...they weren't creeps to my friends and I.I also like the actors (I miss Sasha Alexander - Cate)! Now...I miss Cote de Pablo (Ziva)...but, I really like Emily Wickersham (Bishop), too.This is a great show...I love how they show and mention places I was, in Virginia and in D.C.Mark Harmon (Gibbs) is 'believable' as an NCIS agent - cool, calm, and, collected...always focused - he's great; and, he's a great and respected leader and very honorable. Even 'his' bosses respect him.Michael Weatherly (DiNozzo) is also great...very clever, and, very funny and tactless...I like that!Abby is an eccentric genius; McGee is a computer wizard; Cate is a total brainiac hottie; Ziva is a 'kick-ass' hottie; Ducky is a medical genius, on top of being a worldly genius (I LOVE his stories!); and, the rest of the cast is...great!!I really love this show...and, especially how the characters interact!Also...be very careful if you're eating or drinking while watching this show, as I once laughed soda through my nose when Gibbs slapped DiNozzo on the back of his head...and, this can occur without warning. :D"
179,"I don't think killing Ari could be a defining moment for Ziva; rather, it's a defining moment for Gibbs to trust Ziva. As Vance said and Ziva later admitted, her killing Ari is following her father's order to clean up Mossad's mess.The first defining moment should be the 3rd season's finale. After a year following and learning from Gibbs, Ziva and Gibbs gradually formed a apprentice-mentor relationship. When Gibbs was bombed, she was forced to face the question that how much she cared about this mentor. When no one could jog his memory back until she tried, their apprentice-mentor relationship was established; even though, Gibbs left immediate after this event. Four months later, another incident, which happened in the first episode of season 4, further enhanced Ziva's relationship not only with Gibbs but the rest of the team. After she worked four months under Tony's commend, Mossad created an incident causing her become a suspect. Tony and the team went all out to clear Ziva; they even dragged Gibbs out of his retirement in order to help her. This incident is the first time Ziva realized that Mossad didn't regard her as a member and kept secrets from her; also, from this incident, she felt her team in NCIS is more trustworthy than Mossad.Then the following three seasons, Ziva's gradually forging relationship with Tony and McGee as partners, and Gibbs as her mentor. They together as a team went through the Jenny Shepard's fight with Rene Benoit. After the fight, she helped Tony went through his breakup with Jeanne. Then they went through Jenny's death, Leon's mole haunting. During those three years, she's also growing more and more apart with Mossad. At the end of season six, even her father doubted her loyalty to Mossad.The third defining moment is at the end of season six, when she found out her boyfriend was just a ruse that her father played to gain more operation space inside American soil. After Tony's killing her boyfriend and her father's betrayal, she didn't know what to believe, who to depend on. Feeling responsible for her boyfriend's death, she decided to fill in her boyfriend job in Mossad to hunt down the terrorist organization. But the mission didn't go well, and she was captured.The fourth defining moment is she found out Gibbs led the rest of the team to rescue her. After Abby and McGee went great length to find the hideout of the terrorists, Tony and McGee deliberately had themselves captured and tortured by the terrorists in order to determine Abby's finding and persuade their director to send the U.S. military after the terrorists. On the one hand, her father left her in the desert to die. On the other hand, her teammate risking their lives went all out to rescue her. Facing these two different actions--albeit she might know her teammates have the American Military all over the world back them up and her father doesn't have such resources, she finally considered her teammates as her family, not just partners.After she was rescued back to D.C., she confided in Gibbs, and they cleared all left doubts between each other. At that time, in her mind, Gibbs is more father to her than her own father; Tony, McGee and Abby are more like siblings to her than co-workers. So she decided to become naturalized American citizen and make home there, which is different from the comment she made on her living place before they went to Israel: ""That's just an apartment, not my home"". The fifth defining moment is when Gibbs whispered ""Listen to me. You're home."" to her ear after they cleared her from her father's ruse to stop her from becoming a NCIS agent. After the event, she totally lost her faith in her father, and was officially recognized by Gibbs as his daughter."
180,"Dear Mr. Harmon, as an Israeli citizen, I feel offending the picture about the Mosad as mindless, skilless, violent murderers. True, our Land is a hard one, hard decisions are made in hard situations - also because the Muslim mind considers mercy as fear and uses the judeo-Christian world-view as a weapon for instance by hiding behind their women and children or sending THEM to murder (many 8 year old kids are already skilled murderers). In spite of this Israeli soldiers and all defensive powers and institutions use peaceful, diplomatic or psychological solutions as long as they can. Although I haven't succeeded to settle down for longer than 10 years (thanks to the worldwide economical crisis), my heart is left there and I beg of you, use your influence to show a more realistic picture through Ziva David about my beloved ISRAEL. Thanks forward agnes losonczi"
181,"I really like this show! Great characters, good stories, humor. What more can you ask for? I liked Kate better than Ziva but Ziva is OK.McGee is a bit too nerdy. The character is OK but sometimes I wonder how he got the job in the first place. Tony can be annoying but there's warmth and humor in his way of being. Abby and Ducky are great characters overall. Gibbs is definitely a good team leader. Sometimes he acts like a jerk against his people but it seems to be part of the interaction between the team members and I don't think anyone of the others feel insulted because Gibbs actually cares about his people.I find NCIS very exciting and very entertaining and can hardly wait for the next episode!"
182,"NCIS is the best show on the planet. And this is coming from someone that watches a lot of TV . Since probably the A Team, i don't think there has been a how , where every single character is a delight to watch. Without a doubt i have to say that NCIS is among my top five favourite shows. I must admit channels surfing and seeing the shows title on the Hallmark channel i really wasn't interested in anything that it had to offer. But by chance i did sit down one day to watch the show and i was completely blown away.Forget CSI, it may be a more popular show , but by far i prefer NCIS. The banter between Di'nozzo and Kate is what i love the most, their hate/beef relationship and the way Tony is a guys guy, humorous in every way, and i can't imagine the show without his character. And the gorgeous Kate played by Sasha Alexander, i just love their relationship. Then when it comes to comes to Gibbs, he's not one dimensional like Haratio, and i just love the Father/Child relationship he has with Tony and Kate. The supporting characters of Abi,Doc and McGee are lovely too.I haven't seen David Macullum since he played Kuriyakan in The Man from U.N.C.L.E, which i absolutely loved. A definite 10 , i would watch NCIS over any other detective/Investigation show. A must watch."
183,"Virtually not a weak link in any character and episode.Interesting plots, clever storyline and forensics and, above all, the dry humour reminds me of British humour, not the traditional pie-in-your-face style.Mark Damon, as Jethro Gibbs, is a totally plausible leader.The banter between DiNozzo (superbly acted by Michael Weatherly) and his female counterparts in Todd (Sasha Alexander) and then Ziva (Cote de Pablo) is funny and realistic.Abby (Paulet Perrette) is superb as the weirdo technical wizz and is superbly offset by Ducky (David McCallum) the ""doctor"".McGee (Sean Murray) is magical, despite the attempted put-downs and/or one-upmanship attempts by DiNozzo and (sometimes) Abby.All in all, a remarkably watchable and interesting series - in some ways reminding me of MASH."
184,"Hi to all:YES! Gibbs, Aka Mark Harmon was a cute guy! Now, he is a gorgeous MAN! He is sexy, and I love this show!QUESTION: On one of the first episodes of fall 2006, there is a scene where Tony Dinozzo goes...""Chick Fight"" and later, he and ""Probie"" pull off their shirts! My Direct TV was not acting correctly, and I did not get to tape this. Can anyone tell me what the name of that episode is? I LOVE THIS SHOW! My son-in-law was in the Marines, and he was the one that told me about this great show! I really love Ziva. My husband is Jewish, and she is great in the character she plays, although I have to admit, I hated that Kate got killed a couple of seasons ago. Ducky is funny, and when his mother is on the show, it is even funnier!This is the PERFECT CAST!!! Please e-mail me w/the episode:)! Osslady2333@aol.com"
185,"Navy Criminal Investigative Service is one of the best TV shows in the world at the moment because of its unique characteristics. The show has a wonderful cast where each character has his/her own unique style. The idea of a ""my rules"", by Gibbs puts the audience is a ""high"", because of the Rules/Laws he breaks. There is a major difference between NCIS and other Criminal Investigative shows, the producer has included comedy within the storyline which breaks the tension between the ""seriousness"" thus attracting a larger audience. The director comes up with unique ideas for each episode, making every episode enjoyable. Even if you have seen the episode previously you would still want to see it again just for those ""special"", funny themes that gives everyone a laugh. Most importantly this show can be viewed by a much larger age bracket because it contains more story, comedy etc rather than Gore or violence."
186,"When Leroy Jethro Gibbs was introduced during ""JAG"" he turned in a performance very different from the frothy ""Summer School"" of decades ago. Mark Harmon has matured most gracefully, and plays the curmudgeon to the hilt - but not over it! The age-related zingers resonate with this particular baby boomer and I enjoy all of them.Michael Weatherly gets to play against his previous casting as ""Eyes Only"" from the late, lamented ""Dark Angel"" series, showing us a broadening range of acting skills.The addition of David McCallum as the coroner is spot-on, and Paulie Perrette's Abby is most refreshing.The addition of Agent Lee with the penchant for hijacking morgue attendant Palmer also makes for unexpected levity.The stories keep me enthralled as I can never figure out whodunit, nor whydunit."
187,"I've been watching the show from the first season. I'm a retired Naval officer, which explains my initial attraction. That in itself was not enough. What kept my attention and loyal viewing were a) plot content, b) acting, c) accurate forensic medicine and technology.Strong points: There are many, just a few 1. The acting is seamless, which means the audience sees the character, not an actor playing a part. 2. Plots are interesting and vary with a nice diversity, making each show fresh and not feeling like you've seen this show before.Weak points: 1. Every once in a while it seems the writers get in a bind. The result is plot holes and technical inaccuracies. 2. Personally, I wish they had kept Sasha Alexander on the show ('Kate Todd'). Her character as well as Sasha's natural look were much more believable than Cote de Pablo. Don't get me wrong. Cote is hands-down gorgeous -- but definitely on the petite, cute side. (and enough of that long-standing gag of a language barrier!) Sasha's good looks made her character more believable, like she really could bring a bad guy down. Her beauty was more mature, smart, self confident.Summary: Very entertaining show that mixes drama (blood and death) with enough comedy to break the tension. The methods for solving the cases are enlightening and revealing and (for the most part) accurate."
188,"What makes this programme excellent is that it allows us to watch people who are good at what they do. We enjoy the company of characters who are good at what they do; actors who are good at bringing those characters to life; writers, directors, casting producers, editors, music supervisors who are all good at what they do.Television -- both drama and comedy-- is always better when it is built on, around , by and about people who are good at what they do. These same observations were true about the programme ""JAG"", which was consistently excellent for the same reasons. Let us hope that more programming will be based on this simple principle: let us watch the work of people who are good at what they do."
189,"I absolutely LOVE this show, since my friend Stacey got me onto it. My favourite character is Abby. I have seen the second half of seasons 2 and 3, they are currently playing on TV here. I recently got the season 1 DVDs, they only recently came out here, and I have been watching them heaps! NCIS is the best part of my Wednesday nights (shows on Wednesday in Aus.) and it would not be the same without the show. I always laugh at the quotes I hear from others, especially my friend Stacey, who has several pages of NCIS quotes. I think that NCIS is different to other crime shows, eg. CSI, because of the increased focus on the lives of the characters, not just the crimes that they investigate, which makes it better in some regards. Overall, NCIS completes my week, and I hope it continues to be shown on TV for awhile, but when it stops, there will always be the DVD's!"
190,"Action, drama, suspense, and some comedy. NCIS is one the best shows that I have ever seen about military and law enforcement. A group of people investigating crime and then bringing them to justice. I especially like Special Agent Gibbs attitude. He is not afraid to pursue the criminal and always things with his head. And tends to be serious, while Special Agent Denozzo tends to good around and mocks McGhee and quotes movie lines. But then when Zeva David joins the force she and Tony oftens goes to crime scenes and work together but not in a sort of great way. Also one thing I like is they take place in the Maryland DC and Virginia area. And even Tony also mentions Baltimore a few times. Hey my hometown. Now Abby also is a good person, in her lab as she does her Ballistics and likes to drink a Huge thing of whatever she drinks in that 7-11 cup that can be almost a two liter. And then Ducky who does the autopsies and sometimes in the middle of work when Gibbs walks in and asks questions about the victim or the other person. While Ducky tries to work to keep up with Gibbs who does not procrastinate and wants things done fast and right. And even though Gibbs and Shepperd who the head director of NCIS and even though she is a woman she does a heck of a job, they do make a good couple but they are very close. NCIS just puts you in the action and I really enjoy the show and I cannot wait for the next season after Gibbs gives Tony his badge and leaves for Mexico after the Coma he was in after the Bombing of a ship and when we wakes loses his memory for a while. But I wonder how Tony lead the team even though Gibbs has left and Tony well, likes to have a little fun but I guess that won't hurt much, after all Zeva would probably put him in his place."
191,"Man I always thought that the chemistry between Donnozo and Kate would amount to something more. I guess that can't happen now that she is dead. Kate was my favorite's character and i can't believe they killed her off. Does anyone know Why she left the show?I am in Australia so we only just saw the season2 finally and i was hoping that they would bring her back some how (like it was just a dream) but then i realist that i wouldn't be NCIS it would be like all the other lame soaps on T.V and that is why we love NCIS. I hope that they get another head strong female to replace her, who will keep Donozzo in his place"
192,"NCIS is getting tired and lacks credibility, these people are supposed to be part of a government agency so when did it become acceptable to slap subordinates? Whoever the writer was that came up with the idea of an Israel agent working in the ranks of a federal agency that has access US military should be shown the door.There is also the IT component of the show, hacking, cross referencing of data etc, the shows writers don't have any idea. There is the way they show things on NCIS and then there is the real world way. The Sharpening of images is the one that always annoys me since there is only so much you can do with a blurred image and this show almost always comes up with some nice crisp reworked image and that is a load of crud. This show needs to be reclassified as fantasy.The show is slowly slipping in a big spiral, time to deploy the life boats."
193,"Mark Harman's portrayal of a cantankerous NIS agent is wonderful. But does anyone believe any police official could force criminal confessions weekly by threat of force.It took years for Bellarsario to implement Navy protocols in JAG in a beliveable way. Hopefully he can find a technical advisor who actually has experience as an agent with NIS, CID or OSI."
194,"If you can look past Gibbs crappy haircut then you might actually be able to enjoy the show. But the bad haircut really is a major distraction. As written, it is not believable that any sane person would keep such a crummy haircut for 10+ years. There is no insight to why Gibbs wears his hair this way. I think the writers should write a flashback episode that reveals the mystery of Gibbs hair-do. I think it is lazy script writing to leave this matter unresolved and not understood. The truth is, none of the writers can come up with a legitimate reason for anyone to wear their hair like this. Gibbs seems to have everything in order except for his haircut. Why would he leave it this way. It does not reflect well on his character."
195,Definitely lost its luster since she left. Bring her back!
196,"I have enjoyed NCIS since it's origin even after Kate (Sasha Alexander) left with the addition of Ziva (Cote de Pablo). Ziva's departure was difficult but I eventually accepted Ellie (Emily Wickersham). But when Anthony DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly) left whoever made the decision to replace him with Nick Torres (Wilmer Valderrama) made a serious error in judgement; nothing against the actor but his arrogance has failed to match the lovable arrogance of DiNozzo. But the absolute worst decision was adding Kasie Hines (Dion Reasonover) to the cast replacing the second most popular character Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette), the first being Ziva. I really never cared about the weekly stories since they were all formulaic but the relationships between characters was the most important. Now, that is the flaw with this show. The characters really don't relate all that well."
197,Enough already of the Kasie haters. I like her and was tired of them writing Pauley Perrette in as a big superstar. Good riddance and give Kasie a chance even when she's featured. We know who the big star of the show is. Just enjoy it while we can.
198,"These people who run this show are complete fools,idiots , morons for letting Abby (Pauley Perrett ) go from the show .you might as well cancel the show without Pauley Perrett .i heard all the reasons and its all B.S."
199,"An investigative team within NCIS solve US Navy based crime. Like procedurals such as CSI there's lab work, morgue pathology scenes and field work with gun-wielding ex-marines and agents. There's humour, heart, good plots and silly one-liners. Often the cases can be dangerous with suspense, gory bits and emotional scenes where their private life issues impact on work. There are great, varied characters from the goth vampy science lab-rat Abby (Pauley Perrette), British Pathologist ""Ducky"" (David McCullum), wise-cracker playboy DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly) lead by their commander Gibbs (Mark Harmon) to, in some of the series, the fabulous tough-gal ex-Mossad agent Ziva David (Cote de Pablo) who all bring various aspects to the stories.Like all procedurals, there are some jumps of supposition, and like all similar American programs it's a bit formulaic, and can be silly and predictable, with some cheese, but it's great television, very watchable and the cases - being military - are slightly different from the normal city-cop version of this sort of program you usually get. It's an enjoyable watch with something for everyone. Easily the best US murder/investigative procedural on TV at present."
200,"Casting Cote De Pablo and Lauren Holly was the worst miscasting ever. They have added nothing to the show. Cote De Pablo is not as successfully compatible on camera with Michael Weatherly as Sasha Alexander was. I have stopped taping the show because it really doesn't make a difference now whether I miss the show or not. There is no chemistry whatsoever between her and Michael Weatherly, and there is zero chemistry between Holly and Harmon. Where there was suspense before, the scenes are now so predictable it is tending more towards a comedy show than a scientific solving of the case. Having so many qualified actresses to cast you certainly missed the mark with the way Pablo and Holly have interpreted their roles so far. The constant sarcasm Pablo dishes on Tony becomes very irritating as it has escalated in the last couple of episodes."
201,"IMO Kate was one of the best characters on the show.Consequently, I found the sexual fantasy flashbacks in ""Kill Artie, Part 1"" particularly disgusting!! If I wanted to watch that kind of soft porn (e.g. Kate in black leotards/underwear and whip) and dialog (e.g. some of the references to lesbianism), I'd watch them on the movie network, where I could see them without commercial interruptions.If that level of sexual innuendos and content continues, rest assured I'll quickly remove NCIS from my viewing list.In addition, please lose the head slapping by Gibbs. Such action can actually cause brain damage, and has long been banned from schools.W F Metcalf"
202,"I was so glad to see the DiNozzo character leave. I couldn't stand him. He was a juvenile jerk, shallow, and incredibly disrespectful to his co-workers. Of course, they all act a little juvenile. The BIG loss that really disappointed me was Abby. The show had been sliding downhill a little, but took a nosedive after Abby left. I still gave a 7 rating, but it was at least an 8 before, despite DiJerko."
203,"After having rediscovered NCIS after years of not watching the current crap movies,sitcoms,late night TV etc I'm so very pleased to have found that NCIS is still filled with great acting, storylines, patriotism and enjoyment! Start with the pilot - enjoy the binge!"
204,We need to see more Delilah! Great actress. Very talented.
205,The best series the world can offer. Genius. I love this show so much it has made me cry more than any other tv show. Semper Fi.
206,"Soap opera scripts; glib, soap-level acting and laughable plots.
If my mother didn't watch it 24/7 I'd never have to see it.
How has this lasted so long?"
207,DiNozzo is a major detriment. The nonsensical banter!? Really?!
208,"I love NCIS, and I'm currently having a marathon run on amazon prime. I loved Kate and Ziva - but I have to admit I'm not a fan of Agent Eleanor Bishop! She's very annoying and a 'know it all' - I hate that. I've only seen her in a few episodes but I'll continue to watch it in the hopes it will get better."
209,"Acting is good, storylines are not deep, easy to solve, not always legally correct but there is something here. I'm not a fan of the family aspect of the crew as the annoying character Emily Wickersham plays a little girl trying to act tough. Why do they give her the right to pry into team mates lives? The most annoying is the psychotherapist, which is not the actresses doing - Maria Bello. Her character puts forth psycho babe that is obvious, derivative and as in many dramas she spouts the same jargon of the American culture 'talk therapy' solves everything, and if you're not doing this 'you have serious issues of denial'. Crap!. Also why did they make her so insecure...that is a stand alone annoyance.Generally I understand how this has 17 series."
210,When is the new episode and the new season come out. And i really hope nick and ellie gets in a couple.
211,"I have been a fan of NCIS for years, particularly since they added Cote DePablo. I even managed to find enjoyment with the newer characters in Season 11 and beyond. However, it's lost a bit of its magic. I am writing this to vent about the last couple of seasons, in particular about whoever is responsible for makeup and wardrobe. McGee's long and greasy comb back makes him look like a middle aged predator. Gibbs has enough make -up on to look like a walking corpse; we know he is getting older (We all are!), but there is so much puddy on his face it makes him look absolutely awful. Who is responsible for dressing Bishop and Torres? They look like bums. If a federal agent ever came to me dressed like those two, I would have a difficult
time believing they actually worked for a federal agency. Ziva and Tony were dressed decently, actually more than decently, but Bishop and Torres look cheap and unclean. It's so disappointing. At least, Sloan, Vance, Palmer and Ducky are still dressed professionally and Kasie is dressed appropriate to her role. Sloan in fact has a wardrobe worthy of watching each week. Other facets of this show can be discussed - Ziva years vs. Bishop years or DiNozzo years vs. Torres years - but I personally needed to vent about the poor wardrobe and make-up!"
212,Purchased DVDs of first 13 series. We are totally captivated. Love the characters. From the spoilers it would appear that series 14 onwards drops its semper fidelity with committed fans. Probably we wont buy the next 3 series but will dine out on endless replays. We have turned off the record button for the latest shows on UK tv. Long live the box set. Looking forward to seeing Kate again and the interactions of Tony and the ladies. Best bit is Gibbs is as old as me in the story and older than me in real life. Makes me feel semper paratus or ninquam non paratus as in my family motto. Bought an ncis hat which goes down well with my US business colleagues
213,"While this show had been good to me for many years, and would make a good show to marathon on Netflix, this show is simply trash police propaganda, as with all other shows such as this. I will never watch this show, or any show like this, again. While at one time it was good to me and good for me, it's plainly propaganda for the police and other hands of government that I want no part of. That negates anything else this show has to offer. This belongs in the trash and in the past, as do the rest of the shows like this. Added to this is downright unwatchable and asshole characters, a healthy does of Islamophobia and of course, plenty of needless explosions."
214,"I've always thought Mark Harmon one of the most interesting actors on television - he is SO understated, has no annoying mannerisms to indicate the same feelings time after time, he's just great. Otherwise, even though I'm also a fan of McCallum, I find the treatment of his character difficult to take (complete disdain from one and all) and the other characters are fingernail on chalkboard annoying. Why not make the whole show classier by going the (original) Law & Order series route - very professional, no hokiness, no cardboard signature for the characters? I'd love to see Harmon in plots as tight as Law & Order, with characters around him like the female Ass'ts. D.A. who have always been around Michael Moriarty or Sam Waterston - serious, fast-paced, hard working - and not, well, idiotic. I do like JAG because it is one of the few shows on television that isn't cynical, has heros at its center, two very likeable stars, and is the only patriotic show on television. (So I strongly disagree with the featured reviewer - what's wrong with having a patriotic drama?). The downside of JAG is its terrible humor, the slow-paced plots, and the simplicity of the program. Unfortunately, we get the latter (and not the former) in N.C.I.S.Still if you like Mark Harmon, you'll like him in this. And he's always excellent. So I watch it - and would recommend it for that reason alone."
215,"This used to be one of my favorite shows. The new blond girl after Ziva is just silly fluff. Ducky's assistant strives mightily to be WACKY! and now Ducky's gone. The new ""Tony"" isn't bad but obviously the token Latino hottie. Not a huge fan of Abby but her replacement - OMG - new heights (or lows, rather) in moronic millennial casting. She's constantly babbling, whining, ingratiating - basically a female Urkel only more annoying. Every episode now has at least one (sometimes more) avuncular, preachy heart-to-hearts reminiscent of a very special Blossom. The plots are tissue-paper thin. Gibbs' hair is too long. Please - just cancel it so I can quit watching."
216,I absolutely enjoy this show and all its entertainment. I will say that my favorite character is Gibbs. My second favorite character is Tony DiNozzo. I do enjoy the relationship that Tony and McGee had. I miss that in the show. I will say that it would be nice to have Tony make a guest appearance with his little girl. I just absolutely love this show.
217,"I got hooked into this show due to how the show revolves around cases involving the navy and the marines. And due to my fascination with military stuff, I was hooked from a very young age. I was 2 when the series started so when I was between the ages 7-9 I would always sneak downstairs when my mom was watching and just watched from under the table. I would give this show a 10/10, but the thing that held me back from giving it a perfect 10 was that the newer seasons had fan favorites like Ziva, Tony and Abby leave the show. And those characters were amazing and gave the actors who are going to play the characters replacing them a very high standard to beat. I think as long as either McGee, Gibbs and Ducky are still in the show, then the show might have a chance. But I think the show might be done for if Either Gibbs, McGee or Ducky leaves the show.
Despite the removal of fan favorite characters, this show is amazing with a huge cast chemistry and a bit of comedy in the mix and a show that is great for fans of police procedural drama and military fans alike. Think of this show as csi but with more laughs and a good amount of action. Do not read past this part if you don't want spoilers about what happened to what character. If you disregard this message, you can't say I didn't warn you.This review is going to contain spoilers for anyone who hasn't watched the show past season 10 because of the following seasons has characters leaving and getting killed off. What happened to Ziva, Abby and Tony are as follows:Ziva: gets killed off in season 11, leaving Tony with the daughter named Tali that she and Tony had together
Tony: Resigns after the season 13 finale to raise Tali, the daughter he had with Ziva.
Abby: Gets severely injured in a failed assassination attempt that killed CIA Agent Reeves, recovers got the hitman who tried to kill her to confess, and resigns to accompany agent Reeves to England and starts a charity in Reeves' honor that helps the homeless."
218,"And still love it.I love the slow emotional growth of all characters. Gibs in particular. It's so nice to see him slowly grow into this happy person.
I wish I was part of such a team too.
I am so happy that Belgium is not too much behind on the seasons. I wish I could say te same for ncis New Orleans."
219,"I guess years ago I watched; I put up with more and would watch a slow 4 star. And early on, it wasn't as repetitious. Barely entertaining. boring, bad acting. I didn't like the characters and the plot lines were mundane. The thing I hated most, was Mark Harmon as the wise kind father figure, who protects and likes women. Having met him once, before NCIS, I was offended in a very casual exchange. Michael now has a spin off, always seemed way too full of himself. OK, he was a model. Reading some on set problems, with Pauly speaking out about being terrorized, and what happened to Cote, forced to leave? They were too popular. And others with both Mark and Michael on his set, I see my perceptions of them were correct. Now, you can say who they are shouldn't influence how I perceive their performances. but who they are showed in their performances. Smug. Neither are the best actors. I thought People's sexy man of the year for Mark Harmon years ago was laughable. I do think, it is fair to look at an actor, and say, I don't like you, as an actor and for what you've done.
Beside that, the story lines and characters are just boring. Sure. it's hard to get a new spin on an old theme. But that's no excuse."
220,With ziva or Tony or Abby I don't think the newer characters get along as much the 3 I just mentioned anyway I think some programmes run there course and I'm sorry to say I think this is one of them
221,"I loved this show but even from the start the scripts where not always good.because the scripts for certain characters where made less interesting even if they had similar lines, the scripts for gibbs where always make him right he might be the star character but everyone is wrong about one thing or other,the loss of actors from the later seasons has also contributed to the loss in quality of the show it was once a great show now it is well below anything even worth watching anymore, the supporting actors of the show are bad or either the script writers have made their characters very one dimensional and boring and predictable, there is no chemistry between the actors in the later seasons this show was in its prime from the first episode to season 13 finale, but no way this show can be resurrected to its former glory, due to the loss of so many of the original cast, the newer cast members do not have the same quality and the scripts are a lot worse than before. The producers and directors and script writers of this show have gotten complacent and has really resulted in how uninteresting this show is.This is why tv shows of today will not last for too many seasons quality and longevity are not their priority just how much money they can make. the audiences don't seem to mater or producers of shows like this don't realise how smart their audiences really are.just watch until season 13 but don't bother with the rest as it has gotten boring."
222,"I loved this show when it first started. I couldn't wait till the night it was on. That was what I felt for the first 10-12 seasons. Then it was like the writers were starved for new material. And, as the seasons progressed it just got worse. The cast was great. The scripts good. But, now I'm done watching it. Please, for the love of God, put this show to sleep!"
223,I like it when Tony makes fun of McGee and when Gibbs smacks people on the head
224,"In 13 years, NCIS has become a phenomenon. It has become and is still today the most watched TV show in the world in any genre. It has also attracted a lot of fans around the world including me and was the origin of two successful spin-offs in LA and New Orleans. But the original show remains the best of the three and my first favorite.The stories are captivating and remarkably written. Throughout the 12 seasons I haven't felt bored watching an episode once. It is always related to the Navy and the Marines Corps but this doesn't exclude that the stories are diversified and bring us a lot of emotions. There are several episodes which are really gut-wrenching and should be considered as a model for scriptwriters all around the world.But this is not only about the stories the show owns its success, it is first and foremost thanks to the amazing casting performance and the very high chemistry between the team members. It is more than a team we are watching doing their work, it is a family. The links between each of the members is so strong it is a pure enjoyment to see them teasing and interacting to each other. Here the team is the star. I have never seen anything like it in any other crime shows before. And I am welcoming it with open arms.The other thing I love really much is that we can see the team outside of their jobs, enjoying time together or with their own families. In other shows we could see some part of the personal life of the characters but never to that extent. With NCIS it's almost like we are living with the team and they share no secrets to us. It is making them much more appreciated and more identifiable to our way of life. Some TV shows tried to imitate that philosophy but they never match the quality of how the stories are told.It deserves nothing more than a 10 out of 10 and I wish to Gibbs and his amazing team of Very Special agents to delightfully entertaining us for many more years to come."
225,"Hi,i am probably NCIS's youngest fan, Really. my favorite characters must be Abby and McGee so far i am at series 8 episode 2, seeing as i watched my first NCIS episode 2 years ago and i also watch many other shows such as Rookie Bllue and CSI and Castle! Abby: Abby is totally me and well i love her style and the music she listens to. Abby and Mcgee are totally right for each other though they don't seem to go out after series 1! which is a total shame and i hope they get together, please tell me if they have in episodes i have not seen yet :D Mcgee: i Think that he does great (Seeing as he is like 34 or something) and is like the youngest so he is so mature :D"
226,Just to say i know this is a random comment but in the quotes you have ziva David down as a special agent but she ain't she is an officer and also besides that it is a really ace programme i have been watching it since it started in 2003 and i think that the performance has bee Brilliant and hope it continues for many years to come and also i shall just pick up on some points i really liked was when that Kate got up from after taking a hit and then being shot in the back and then just flopping into Mrak Harmons arms i thought that bit was about to make me cry and also in the episode when Mark Weatherly was needing a sleep and Abby gave him a farting pig i just couldn't stop laughingAnywho hope you enjoy the show as much as i have
227,"Even the greats like X Files and Game Of Thrones got worse as they progressed but this show has never dipped in quality every new character they introduce is great they all have wonderful chemistry and amazing banter, that feeling of friendship and comradery is amazing, it reminds me a lot of Stargate SG-1 except well naval crime not sci fi wars with robots and parasitic aliens. I can't find any flaws with this show i wouldn't call it the peak of entertainment and story writing but it's very good imagine it like criminal minds except the characters have more fun. It even spawned a reasonably good LA spin off with LL Cool J if they're not as likeable but still pretty good, I hope this show never gets cancelled it is brilliant for what it is just a simple crime show to easily watch most others have dumb niches and such or hire a complete cast of unlikeable young people who are basically there look good and say buzzwords I'm looking at you FBI, it's just nice to watch a show more focused on being entertaining than trying to preach some point or show off there attractive stars doing uninteresting stuff and put basically no effort into the episodes story I'm looking at you SWAT.
NCIS is basically a 70s cop show in the modern day without much risk of that new breed of the preaching politics in cop show cliche that is in practically everything just sit down and watch Tony and Gibbs banter a bit and solve a crime good stuff."
228,"I never really liked any of the CSI series so I kinda avoided ncis for a long time, I finally watched a few years ago I loved it Gibbs Dinozzo and the rest of the team are great I love the added humor, I am only on season six so I have a lot of catching up to do"
229,"I am an occasional lover of NCIS.
I used to watch it religiously but I felt it became less and less entertaining as time went on.
I was urged to watch an episode tonight Exit Strategy.
I am from Edinburgh Scotland and much of this episode is set there.
I realise that it won't matter much to non Scottish people but the Scottish accents in this are awful.
I love American and Ireland but American tv producers seem to think that Scottish accents are exactly the same as Irish ones.
The funniest thing in the world is the film about Prince William and Kate Middleton at university in Scotland,it is sunny all the time and all the locals have irish accents."
230,"A Deaf reviewer here.This show is my classic childhood tv show favorite! I never get tired watching the dialogues of the characters and the suspense through the episodes. I feel connected with Abby actually because she knew sign language because of her parents. I must confess, it is hard to pick Gibbs or Anthony but Gibbs tops them all. I admire how he continues to be strong and wise to others. His leadership really make his team the best team out there. I enjoyed watching Ziva too as well since she is a dynamic character that evolves through the seasons. I really wish those characters are real in real life though!Cannot wait to see more of this show in the future, especially, the surprising end of the season 15 or 16 with the appearance of returning character!"
231,"The characters have evolved into caricatures of themselves, the plots are too predictable and the whole Ziva thing this season was way too self-indulgent. Save the show with new cast members or kill it cause it's done."
232,"Been watching NCIS on Netflix...so many gem episodes, and can't wait for Ziva's return this season...With that said...Maria Bello's Character ""Jack Sloane"" is the absolute worst addition to the show. Where as Ducky showed his progression earning his skill for profiling, the writers decided to create this shallow, annoying person that just keeps rubbing that one nerve so raw you have to fight to want to watch episodes she's included..."
233,"This is one of the best shows I've ever seen. It does have its up and downs but overall it's an amazing show. I love the characters and the story lines, this show really keeps me going when I feel down.I would definitely like Michael Weatherly to return it really isn't the same without him but it's still a good show without him. The actors really do work well with each other, the characters are very different from the normal set of procedural characters that gives NCIS some of it quirks.I've watched this show from start to finish too many times to count and it really doesn't get old."
234,"This show has become THE staple of late night TV viewing. As such it really can't be ""reviewed"" in any conventional sense. It is a TV institution. When it goes it will leave a distinct hole to fill. One thing I do know for certain is that there are an amazing number of TV commercials on TV shows like this these days that often cause me to lose interest in whatever I was watching-this show included. NCIS usually runs at least twice a day and both times suffers from being saturated with TV commercials-like most other TV dramas. I think the idea of TV commercials generally is to hit people while they are in a 'receptive mode' watching something they like-which will in theory make them buy the thing being advertised. Liking a show like this means your IQ is over the level of being so easily influenced. Go figure. I preferred Michael Weatherly in the show Dark Angel-and I don't think that any 40 year old women who wears 'hello kitty' paraphernalia to work would be bright enough to work as a lab tech, never mind as one of the brightest-if not THE brightest-lab technician in the world. The point can be made-and I'm sure many people have said that-to no avail. I think its a seven out of ten and no more because the show gets repeatedly mired in annoying/vaudevillian moments-usually when there is a cadaver present. The only character with a consistently clear head is Jethro Gibbs. I think most people wouldn't want a job that doesn't allow for a personal life. This show suggests such an approach to work is preferable as if work was on a par with being in some kind of a religious order where relationships were 'planet forbidden.' I also think that Ziva's character-although tough & likable-doesn't accurately reflect the real life policy on who can & can't work for an organization like NCIS. I guess being more realistic won't give a show superior ratings. 300 episodes can't be wrong."
235,"Can someone help me out here??? ...I love this show and the actors do a great job, but what I cannot for the life of me understand is....How come the NAVY Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) is running around solving crimes that have a) no known connection to the US Navy; b) no local law enforcement tie-in; and, c) involve crimes that either have not been committed on Federal property or against anyone remotely connected to the government??????? The show is very good and Tom Harmon plays his character exceedingly well; as do the rest of the cast. I just cannot understand how the concept of an investigative service arm of the Department of Defense would ever be authorized to traipse on other ground the way the NCIS folks do. In the real world, this would never happen as they are so secretive of what they do that it would be impossible to gain any cooperation for some insight into this. Colonelgomez"
236,"I watched the premiere of NCIS last night. Donald Belissario who created JAG also created this show and it is in JAGs old time slot. He had introduced the characters last season on JAG when they were investigating the murder of the notorious EVIL!!!!!!!Lieutenant Loren Singer. Mark Harmon is the head of the crack team of investigators who solve military crimes and keep the world safe for democracy. He brings an easygoing, offbeat charm to his role and more then a little bit of world-weary cynicism. Sasha Alexander is a Secret Service Agent who doesn't exactly love him at first but warms up. ""The Man From Uncle's"" David McCallum really steals the show as a garrolous, eccentric pathologist named Ducky. The only character I didn't care for is the one Paulie Perette played, that lab technician with all those tatoos and wierd jewelry. She is very unprofessional. The opening episode was about a mysterious death on Air Force One that someone gets snowballed into a terrorist attempt to kill President Bush. LUCKILY OLD MARK IS THERE TO KICK ASS AND SAVE THE DAY!!!!You almost expect him to run into a phone booth and tear his shirt off. The script is taut and good and they skillfully use footage of President Bush to interact with the scenes and it makes it very realistic. Bellisario makes his shows realistic and topical. It is a little disturbing whenever they mention 9/11 here. They pointed out that two years ago who would have thought terrorists would do something like that. Harmon and his crew aren't the most professional group of investigators in the world, I mean stealing the body off the plane! I also liked the part where him and David McCallum were taking gag pictures of themselves in the President's Chair on the plane. However they are entertaining to watch. This show is the equivilent of a McGriddle at McDonalds, but it leaves a nice buttery, sweet taste going down. It should be a big hit just like JAG is and I'm looking forward to the other topics they are going to cover in the coming season."
237,"Tonight I watched my first NCIS episode. It wasn't even a bit like what real NCIS agents do which is a whole lot of nothing. I was an MP in the Marine Corp and during my time there the only thing I've seen NCIS do is investigate there only agents for improper conduct, sit around and complain about how they hate there jobs, investigate Marines for BS allegation which usually turn out to be unfounded, and I even had one accidentally discharge his weapon is his car because he was screwing around. Don't be fooled by the TV show its not nearly that fun, not even close. Oh and your average NCIS agent is about 250 pounds of balding chewed bubble gum. Well I guess the show does what TV shows should do and thats give me an hour escape from reality. This comment also goes for JAG too."
238,"Whoever said that this son-of-JAG is better than the original needs his/her reality medication changed. The characters are cardboard cutouts, the script lines vary from turgid to absurd, the humour just doesn't make it.Mark Harmond might be a good actor, but here he looks like he's trying to pull the entire cast up by its bootstraps and regrettably, he's not succeeding. Patrick Laborynteaux guested as a JAG-ger last nite. His entire demeanour was a very Woody-Allen-like ""What am I DOING here?????"".
Also, what on earth is this show doing on at 9:30pm on Sunday? Is there ANYBODY at the helm of Channel Ten, or is it just drifting like the Marie Celeste?"
239,"After my initial disgust at the shameless two episode `JAG' tie-in, by Donald P. Bellisario, the creator of both series', I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt, watch both episodes and then render my opinion honestly and fairly.Oh my God this thing is going down faster than a hooker in an alley!!Mark Harmon stars as Jethro Gibbs, the leader of a team of an anti terrorist unit of the Naval Criminal Investigative Services. They prance around the globe hunting Osama-bin villain, which recently has become a shameful TV stereotype.The ""JAG"" episode started out with the discovery of a body of a female naval officer, which ends up being Lt. Loren Singer (Nanci Chambers), a series regular. In a flurry of unbelievable events, series star Commander Harmon Rabb Jr. (David James Elliot) is charged with her murder and while his arrest and trial is taking place, Mark Harmon chases after some badass terrorist.The cast of characters, aside from the hotties with guns, includes a `brilliant yet cantankerous' Medical Examiner whose inappropriate sexual harassment of any female in sight, gets tiring and would, in reality, make him jobless. Then there's the quirky yet gifted tattooed tech, whose oddball behavior, piercings, and diarrhea of the mouth wouldn't get past the initial interview process, never mind being allowed to testify for the prosecution in a court of law.Aside from the characters, I have problems with the technology aspects of the show. Every desk and room has huge 42 inch flat panel computer monitors, which would break the yearly budget of the NCIS.  They have the ability to get live digital video and audio feeds on any person they want, which is absolutely ridiculous.  Plus, they get any info about anything at any computer.  If you watch this show, you'll hear things like `Let me crosscheck the list of most wanted terrorists with the purchase records at the Starbucks in Qatar'.  Aside from being straight out of the Bat Cave, I thought 9/11 taught us that this kind of intel. (SigInt) doesn't work, and we need humans in there gathering info (HumInt).I watched another crossover episode on NBC's `Crossing Jordan', introducing the series `Sunset Division', an almost a carbon copy of `NCIS', featuring ultra modern décor, snappy dialogue, quick camera work and fancy fictional gadgets to help cops get their man.  Both series are ludicrous in that regard. I wish we could get some TV where the gimmicks of the show are good writing and characters."
240,Casey is ok but she is no Abby. The show took a bad turn with Casey. She is like the bad kid actor on the show.
241,"I was in the camp that no Abby would be devastating; but, Kasie has made the the part hers. Missing Abby is over for me. Go Kasie!"
242,"I don't watch a lot of television and tonight (2-28-06) I sat and watched a few minutes of Navy NCIS. My God, I hope this program is total fiction and does not represent in any way the real NCIS of our government.A bunch of twenty-something dummy white males who know nothing and are always wrong, smart-ass know it all women as bosses and enlightened feminists, two weird scientiss that mumble to themselves and spout new age BS.And then Mark Harmon, as the pained old man leader of this band of miscreants or more appropriately excrements, who looks like a man with a bad case of piles.I'm for law and order in this country and a military veteran and a true believer in free speech, but this kind of nonsense should be banned as an insult to our military, government and law enforcement in general."
243,"I can't stand this show! For starters, it's a spin off/rip off of CSI, (not officially, but both are broadcast on CBS) which is an excellent show, but now they have what three spin offs now? I watched this show for five minutes and couldn't stand the cinematography. The camera moves every 5 seconds for now good reason, nauseating the viewer, something I was taught NOT to do in film school. Then there's the dialogue, which is hard to follow since I'm so distraught by the camera angles. Agent Gibbs, the ""leader"" as Grissom is in CSI (not the similarity in name) Gibb's attitude toward his colleagues insulting and the men working for him act very insecure, not something you see in the Navy. The show is comical and hasty in the same way a bad sequel to a good movie makes you feel. If you like CIS, have you seen CSI? Not CSI Miami, not CSI New York. CSI, the one that takes place in La Vegas: it's the first and the best."
244,"********WARNING....POTENTIAL SEASON ENDING SPOILER******************** I watch this series regularly but I'm not sure why. Perhaps it's the time slot. I had grown weary of the ""cheerleader vs. fraternity boy"" banter and sexual undertones between Kate and Tony. I'm sure the assassin was aiming for Tony and Kate got in the way. Tony, the toothy and almost constant sexual harasser, may be a draw for teenage viewers, but his presence on a supposed elite Navy investigation team makes about as much sense as that of a half-loony doctor and a tattooed weirdo lab tech. I was also shocked when I discovered that the sour and dour Jethro was only a Marine gunnery sergeant. With his grumpy demeanor and inflated ego, he would have to have been at least a two-star admiral.Kate and the 'newby' were the only semi-normal people on the show, and I'm sorry to see Kate go. Perhaps her replacement will smash Tony in his perfect teeth at the first sign of harassment.UPDATE, UPDATE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! As fate would have it, I wrote the above review exactly five years ago today!! I am still watching this show, and now I know why. The story lines. Jethro is still a bit dour and Tony is the same sexual harasser, but the tattooed Goth Abbie has been toned way, way down. The addition of the sexy Israeli agent Ziva probably saved the show and the URST (unresolved sexual tension) between her and Tony simmers as Jethro keeps the world a safe place to live. The replacement of Lauren Holly with Rocky Carroll as the Director made the whole show more believable."
245,I've been rewatching ncis and want to know what has happened to cpl werth! Maybe have him join or help with fornell in his new PI cases!
246,"I have watched & re-watched NCIS so many times just because of how much I love it. I've seen about 80% of all crime shows that are available but never loved as much as this. Gibbs, Tony, Ziva, McGee, Abs, Ducky, Palmer & Leon (takes a while for the entire team to come together) are the best, most believable crime solving team.
I miss Tony (the most), Ziva & Abby, but the show is still pretty special."
247,"Usually crime scene Album are follow the same rule.
But NCIS is different I can fell the role growing up and getting better .
Just like a big warm family .
I'm very enjoy this album and recommend everybody to watch."
248,"Terrific show for so long. Can't understand why you cannot find a magic connection like Tony, Ziva, the great McGee, and quirky like Abby but don't bring her back. Perhaps it's the all too common striving to add diversity, or bowing to the smallest minorities which we don't need in every cast and show. Maybe it is just on its last legs..."
249,"Sorry for my bad English, first of all.I am a movie and series geek, allways has been.But i just cant figure out why people enjoy series like NCIS, CSI and so on?The plot/narrow is so thin. Character development is also missing out on the good stuff..Maeby it is just me.. But i feel this series is made for people in a rush.. Who dont have the time to sit down and watch a full Season.. And fair enough. Let them have a life.. But why make a TV series in a way so you dont need/want to see every single episode? You can simple wach 2-3 episodes, and then skip 5 episodes.. . You still understand what is what.. Where is the suspense? Make me want to see every single episode.. Make the narrow so i dont skip out on a single episode.. PLEASE ..I am so sorry for my very bad english. I wish i could make this review in my own language. To make my point.NCIS is fine. But dont have that magic that makes you want to see every single episode. And that just ruins it for me...See for yourself.."
250,"NCIS has been my favorite television show since the first two previews that were in jag 16,17 years ago. I continue to watch this TV show every week when it's on air and I save every episode and have every episode saved from the two preliminary episodes in Jag all the way through to the end of season 16, and I rewatch the seasons constantly. I truly hope NCIS breaks the record for the longest running television show in history."
251,"I recently read a book which had a quote that describes Gibbs's character perfectly; ""I learned early in life that there are people who will hurt you if given a chance, and I have devoted my life to being prepared to face them.""
Pretty accurate Gibbs, right?! But last season, Gibbs suddenly changed into the character typical of this type of show where writers make these guys into weepy, remorse laden, cry-babies. Shows of NCIS's longevity are prone to changes; characters come and go, writers change, etcetera. I waited for years for Dinozzo to grow up, and when he finally did, he was gone. Ziva left but may be coming back--Yea!!! I miss Abby and there are still times I miss Kate. But the during the last few shows of last season Gibbs is starting to change, if so it could be for the end of the series. .
I related to Gibbs especially. Guys like Gibbs exist in real life but are a rarity. Contrary to portrayals in all the other shows like SWAT, Seal Team Six and most of the shows that deal with special ops people (and fail), Gibbs was a character most like real operators. And that strikes a chord with viewers and that might explain the longevity. It's hard to understand but guys like ""Gibbs"" don't get so dominated by their emotions they can't function in their job. Nor do they ""repress their feeling"" then explode in uncontrolled acts of violence. You either under stand this or you don't; about 98% of people don't. I didn't understand it for decades and had shrinks call it a lot of things it wasn't.
The best explanation (and the quotation above) comes from a book entitled ""On Killing"" by Lt. Col. Dave Grossman who did an in-depth study of soldiers and killing in society. He deals with this phenomenon in Chapter 5, where he explains that while these people can be very aggressive, they posses a great deal of empathy for others and as a result the violence is directed solely towards predatory individuals in extreme circumstances. In these situations, their psyche changes and they can do what needs to be done, without remorse or guilt afterwards. The author says: ""These men are quite often armed and always vigilant. They would not misuse or misdirect their aggression any more than a sheepdog would turn on his flock, but in their hearts many of them yearn for a righteous battle, a wolf upon whom to legitimately and lawfully turn their skills.""
If I knew how, I'd contact Mark Harmon or the writers and tell them to read this book, especially chapter five. I hope the story line will be where Gibbs comes to understand this about himself or it maybe the series is ending because the writers, who couldn't possibly understand the concept, want to end the series. But please--Don't Change Gibbs into a cry-baby!!!"
252,Season 16 finale was in my opinion one of the stupidest episodes to date. I turned it off half way through. Sorry but yucky.
253,"We started watching NCIS on Netflix and are now into Season 15. All the actors are very good, but there is one that is torturing us. We don't understand how they got cast and why they're still on the show. They mutter every line as if acting is all about pushing the words of your mouth while you're thinking about pushing the words out of your mouth. Every once in a while, the actor aknowledges the humor of their line by making a goofy face and/or using a goofy voice while saying the line. Even the other cast members seem to ignore this actor because there's nothing to act off of, so their reaction is usually looking down.
UPDATE Same day, later that night, we watched S15E12 ""High Tide"" and the acting was finally good! We theorize that the cast likes this person and they got some coaching. Hoping this will continue.
UPDATE: We are through. We gave it about 10 more episodes, and this actor's acting was only good for that one episode. But oh man two really good actors just left in one episode, so now that really bad actor minus two really good actors....plus even another good actor's acting has gone way downhill, probably from having to react to what the bad actor is giving him. Mark Harmon is great but we just can't"
254,"Brilliant writing, cast of great, brilliant actors, & great camera angles.I have a question....in Abby's lab, there are below ground level, arched windows. 
Are those the same windows that Laverne & Shirley had in their apartment? Sure looks like them."
255,How do their PowerPoints always have all the pictures and documents seconds after discussing the case?
256,"You have to watch this show from the beginning to fully appreciate the beauty of it. My preference is always when a show sticks to the theme without overinvolving the main characters in plot twists. This show was best in the early years before the main characters get into creative conflicts that start to not make sense and entire seasons are devoted to revenge on personal levels with unrealistic themes....the best seasons and episodes are when it sticks to the original plot of investigating crimes and the main characters have interesting side stories that do NOT interfere with the weekly story but wind and build along the way. American TV always makes the main characters a bit TOO unrealistic in their side lives and a bit too quirky and unbelievable, but still fun and you find yourself enjoying the relationships between the characters as much as the show itself. The acting is superb and I will say I have and will follow this show as long as it airs!"
257,"I haven't been watching the series since the beginning (2003), but I did manage to catch up in the last couple of months. I started from season 1 and now I'm a few episodes into season 11, and all I have to say is that something is bothering me! Every time one of the team members becomes close to forming a real intimate relationship, someone either gets shot, dies, leaves the country, is a traitor or is just forgotten. This goes for almost all of the team, especially Gibbs (Mark Harmon). By now, it is clear that Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo is in love with Cote De Pablo's character Agent Ziva David. And the departure of Cote from the show disappointed many, including myself. I just don't understand why the writers thought that the years of anticipation displayed by viewers should only be met with one kiss! One lousy kiss. They could've had something there. Gibbs, on the other hand, could've made it with characters such as LTC Hollis Mann or Jaime Lee Curtis's character Dr. Ryan. I don't understand why any potential long-term love interests don't make it on the show. At the end of the day, NCIS is one of my favorite shows to watch and it has been for many years. The writers are doing an amazing job along with the cast and guests of the show. I only hope to catch some development in terms of real relationships in the near future. *crossing my fingers for Abby and McGee*"
258,"(Minor spoilers for one specific episode further down)NCIS is a show that mix humour, good acting, colourful characters (Abby ;) ) and situations that could happen in real life. The combination is a new approach at crime solving stories on T.V.I think what makes NCIS so great is the casting. Each time there is an actor leaving the crew, the casting people find not only a good actor/ress, but also an interesting character for him/er to play. The crew of actors/resses and their characters is what makes NCIS one of the best shows on TV. Few shows lasts over 10 seasons, not even Star Trek can do that (they run out of ideas very quickly, turning to soap opera and sexual stuff like with Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Once Upon a Time). In NCIS, the writers and producers have the wisdom of not putting all their ideas in a season and be left with nothing for the following seasons, nor do they lower themselves at doing cheap soap opera, sexual stuff and rush/overstretch their stories.Yeah, the writers and producers (Mr. Mark Harmon included) are another big plus for this show to keep it going and going. With all the great minds working together, this show could go on forever. Even if Gibbs retires, the show could go on with Mr. Weatherly as the leader of the squad... and maybe bring back Miss David at that time to strengthen up the crew... Gibbs is a big chunk, but Anthony is a big chunk too and can fill Gibbs' shoes if we let him... he did it for a couple of episodes back in the early days of NCIS.About more superficial stuff... The music is nice and well adapted to the situations and stories in the show. It complements the show quite well.I prefer NCIS over NCIS:Los Angeles because LA is just a Bang-Bang! Pow-Pow! story. I have not seen as single episode where they do not shoot a single bullet (the NCIS team). In NCIS, there are episodes that no one, except maybe the criminal, who shoots (like in episode 22 from season 13, Homefront. No one on the NCIS team shoots, just the killer). LA is just a no brainer series, although like NCIS it has good casting, especially for the four agents (Callen, Kensie, Sam and Deeks), I think that they are running the show, the others are very secondary. Although, I must admit that I have a weak spot for Renée Felice Smith (Nell), she is the most beautiful woman on the show. Miguel Ferer is a good addition to the team, he was a good actor in Crossing Jordan... it would have been nice to make a crossover with his former character, but the writers gave him an assistant director role instead, which is fine since he can be a pain in the butt for the quatuor. I think I'm going to watch Crossing Jordan again, I really liked that show and Jill Hennessy... wouldn't mind seeing her in NCIS (or in LA, New Orleans) as a character that comes and go like Fornell...Speaking of Fornell, I think the character should get more time. The character and actor does great things with Gibbs/Harmon. They have great chemistry. They are funny and pack a punch against bad guys. Hope that the writers don't kill Fornell... kill someone else man! Leave poor ol' Fornell alone. He's been through enough already. ;)They do typical USA series/movies stuff in all NCIS. Like Helicopters and planes flying super low altitude, which is unrealistic. Planes and Copters are ranged weapons and will use their range to their advantage since they are so delicate and will not be close range like we see in USA movies and series. It makes the shows/movies look dumb and silly. They need to fix that.I really like it when they make tires scream on dirt roads. Hahaha! Small mistake on the part of the sound crew, hope they will be more careful in the next seasons. ;)Anyways, I wish everyone working on the show (NCIS) fortune and perseverance. You are doing more than a fine job. Stay away from cheap soap opera. Stay loyal to your recipe, the way you make the show since day one, what the show is about, and the show will go on for maybe another 5 to 10 years depending on when Mr. Harmon will retire from acting in NCIS... I surely want him to stay as a producer as long as he wishes/can, his episodes are really nice.Three thumbs up for everyone doing the NCIS show!"
259,"Created by Donald P. Bellisario - which served in the United States Marine Corps and was awarded the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, and Don McGill, a well known writer and producer, directed by a strong team of directors such as: Dennis Smith, Thomas J. Wright, Terrence O'Hara, (etc) and produced by Belisarius Productions in association with Paramount Network Television, CBS Paramount Network Television, CBS Television Studios and Thinkfilm (for Washington DC scenes), the TV show is about the operations of an elite team of special agents working a series of cases of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service's Washington DC.Watching the NCIS series since the beginning, I find that the cast is very carefully selected to its very best, with believable characters and wonderful plots, one of the best shows on television, so is understandable why it has been on the air for so long. Kate and Ziva's characters were both very exciting and kept the chemistry going between Tony DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly) and them, and brought a little spice to the show.With a bit of an attitude and working under Gibbs, the ""Very"" Special Agent Anthony - Tony - DiNozzo (brilliantly played by Michael Weatherly), a former homicide detective who has his instincts that can only be achieved by working on the streets.Special Agent Caitlin - Kate - Todd (Sasha Alexander), a former United States Secret Service agent on Air-Force One, hired by Gibbs and NCIS on her ""departure"" from Air-Force One and later was murdered in the line of duty by Ari Haswari (Rudolf Martin), a Mossad officer, half-brother of the liaison officer with NCIS, Ziva David.Field agent Ziva David (the brilliant play of glamorous Cote de Pablo), took Kate's place in the NCIS team, a former Mossad officer who is a skilled fighter, helpful past experience as a spy, a multilingual asset of the team (speaks at least 9 different languages), the daughter of the Assistant Director of Mossad, later promoted to the Director of Mossad.The NCIS team gets a new director, Jenny Shepard (play by Lauren Holly). After Holly's departure at the end of Season 5, the NCIS gets a new director, role taken over by Leon Vance (played with excellence by Rocky Carroll).Field agent Timothy McGee (Sean Murray), the son of an Admiral in the U. S. Navy, is a computer-geek agent starting as the junior field agent of the team (Probie) and working his way up to a Special Field Agent position.Being all assisted by the great and funny scientist Abby Sciuto (great performance of Pauley Perrette all the way), the only member of the team that Gibbs actually shows affection for, and sweet Dr. Donald Mallard (David McCallum), nicknamed Ducky, an old fashioned, eccentric Scottish medical examiner and all coordinated by the team leader, special agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs (played by Mark Harmon), a former Marine, becoming a tough investigator and a highly skilled interrogator, smart, tough and willing to bend the rules to get the job done, mentored by his predecessor, Mike Franks (played by Muse Watson).Because in the UK the series are far behind (we are waiting for season 10 to start in February), I can't imagine the show without Ziva, but I believe it's not NCIS without her, and I think that is the reason why ratings have dropped.I LOVE this show!... Will get back with more comments for the newest seasons."
260,"ast episode ever of NCIS. Start off Ziva come back to protect NCIS from the girl that loved zivas brother she starts a terrorist group to go after NCIS personally Gibs quits NCIS cuz he and the girl he dated that went to Hawaii after she Broke up with him cuz of his past they have a baby and he quits NCIS to raise his kid gobs is thrown back into NCIS for the last time to protect his family and his kid and wife from the girl that love zivas brother terrorist group , dililla comes back into megees life and they get married tony gets his own team and so does megee zivas brothers girlfriend also goes after the sister of Kate's out of jealousy At the very end you see megee and tony with there own team one person in Tonys and megees team say something sarcastically and both megee and tony head slap them as the elevator closes with Gibbs inside with his wife and kid and smiles when he sees that and the elevator doors close the end"
261,"I really enjoy NCIS. The story lines always contain a twist and the interaction between characters is enjoyable. The main problem in 2013 is the introduction of the ""Bishop"" character who I find very annoying. I do not think she adds anything to the story line and am not sure why she was added to group. Woulb be better if she just had a recurring role every so often, cannot see what she brings to show. It is like her character was added to try to appeal to a younger demographic. As the show has very high ratings at present why do this. What is her specialty? She uses analysis and thinks her way through a situation, wow! Really!! They already have the think and geek nerds why add another. Still like show but definitely a downgrade with this addition."
262,"Is Ziva really leaving the show? And why is she leaving? How are they gonna make it happen on the show? Who are they gonna use to replace her or are they gonna replace her at all? I think NCIS is the most awesome show on TV today. The characters are great funny and totally believable. The ladies on the show are very strong individuals and yet very sexy, especially Abbie. It has been about 10 years this show has been on TV and I'm willing to bet it can last another 10 years. I've been watching the reruns for as long as they've been showing them. I've watched all the episodes at least 15 times and I've prepared myself to watch them another twenty time as long as they keep showing them."
263,"I really really love NCIS, but there's a few things that bother me, is this TIVA situation, it's been a long time since the producers begun the teasing between Tony and Ziva. You people either get it on, or get it off, because a lot of people is getting tired of this, no one in real life flirt with other people so long. This year some actors of the show teased with: ""this is the year of TIVA"" there's 5 episodes left and we haven't seen a lot of action or chemistry between them. Also the daddy-doesn't-like-me episodes are getting boring and boring by the time and my last issue would be Abby, I love her, but she is getting to old for the goth-look, she needs a make-over asap. Finally I just read they were renewed for season 11, lets hope its gets better and better by the time, because this is one of a few shows I do not want to see and end to it."
264,"This is one of the very best series created in the USA, but it is not surprising, Bellisario at his best (I remember Air Wolf).Being Israeli, and having to live in terrorist surroundings, any one who takes terror seriously, hunts it and brings it down even if it is only a movie, has my full support. When Gibbs says ""we don't negotiate with kidnappers"", or whatever, I thought to myself ""how right he is..."".I get a great deal of pride in seeing MOSSAD mentioned in various series in all episodes related with fighting terrorists..... Ziva David is a good example. By the way the name comes from the word ""zahav"", which in Hebrew means gold and ""ziva"" is the feminine form so she could be ""Goldie"". The bit about Ari being a MOSSAD agent and going to the States to do some terrorists actions, seems to me a bit out of context, I do not think that in reality such a situation could happen, but in a movie... the screen has wide shoulders. When we consider all the terror acts, which took place in 2006 in London, Madrid, Israel, etc., : In French we say ""tous les moyens sont bons"" all means are justified to get them. I hope the USA catches Ben Laden...It is true that Weatherly plays very well the role of DiNozzo (it means the nose in Italian or close to it ? suits him well), but I can't stand this type of person. Don't you have laws in the States about bothering women ? His attitude towards McGee is also unbearable. I love Abby, Dr. Mallard and Gibbs' dry sense of humour. And also Agent Todd.The Hallmark Channel shows the series every week days, and Star World once a week. Yesterday I saw with my husband ""See no evil"", at long last I managed my anti-American series husband to sit and enjoy. He said ""This was a very good episode"". He liked it very much. And I must say this is quite a compliment coming from him.I hope they will continue with more and more episodes."
265,"When series 3 finish airing on FX channel on UK satellite TV it began from scratch with series 1 episode 1 each week night.From the first there was something different about the series. It was fresh and the story lines easy to follow. Bored with CSI which seemed to get heavier and heavier relying more on the forensics than plot, NCIS with its quirky characters grabbed my interest.After 32 episodes I am well and truly hooked and look forward every evening to a dose of the tough, no holds barred Gibbs and co.WHen I discovered that Donald P. Bellisario was the creator I knew I was in for a treat especially after being a fan of Quantum Leap.Bravo"
266,"Kate is supposed to be the presidents secret service protection & after she blows that assignment she gets hired by the same people who got her fired in the first place. And females actually look up to her? Give me a break. Then you have that moron Tony, where did he come from anyway? The only people half decent on this show are the chick in the lab & the medical examiner. Mark Harmon just acts like a grumpy old man. The best part of this show was when they killed off Kate in the last episode. I was hoping that Ari would have a bomb & wipe out the whole cast. Seeing David McCallum makes people yearn for the good old days when a show like The Man From Uncle ruled the airways. Enev the Girl from Uncle would be a better role model for girls, not that incompetent airhead Kate."
267,"first I'd like to be honest, I really only watched maybe 3 full episodes so I am not basing this review on the quality of the show in that respect. the reason I stopped watching this show is the character of Ziva, who is supposed to be an ax Israeli Mosad agent. Really?! I am from Israel and this is just offensive to me... first they brought a South American actress to play the role - granted a beautiful actress, and maybe she is good too I wouldn't know - but she is absolutely not Israeli. there is simply NOTHING Israeli about her. and this coming from a show that's running for a while now, am I supposed to take this seriously? it just makes me think the whole show is full of it. Hollywood is crowded with Jewish producers and what have you, not to mention some Israeli actors that could have actually made this character REAL. why make such a huge mistake???? casting people - WAKE UP!!! we are not idiots. at least, I'm not. so I will never ever watch this show."
268,"Before dissing a show find out why the character is GONE !!! Pauley Perrette caused much more trouble than she was ever worth to the show !! She made up garbage about Mark Harmon to become i don't know what !! She left the show carrying a lot of garbage behind her !!
She was way too old to be playing the perky obnoxious Abby !!!!
Michael Weatherly left to become more famous as Bull..he showed his true colors also being a POS with dirty comments to women and sexually abusing a female guest star .
Why would the show want them back ??
If you cannot watch or change as the show changes ,change the channel !!!
I will stay a loyal fan and stick with it !!
Just stop with the petty stuff"
269,"Up until the end of 13 great years I watched religiously. When Tiny left the show took a traumatic dive into the ol' crapper. For 13 years Gibbs, Tony, and Tim and maybe one other managed to capture audience's attention. Yes it did include Abby, Ducky and the Director. Tony leaves and it becomes necessary to add head count and most of it counts for nothing. One gets the idea that the writers need different characters now to write menial stories about and you know it all is junk, just plain JUNK. I know Mark Harmon draws a tidy sum for each episode and anyone that understands and appreciates acting knows Harmon has lost it a long time ago. His acting stinks and again those that care already know this. Now Abby's history as is Ducky. .... Come on folks stick a pin in it....... it's DEAD."
270,"The show arrived in Italy for the first time, a year later American distribution. The actors are not very welcome to me, the series will have also made his fortune, but I was not particularly impressed. Perhaps if I had more time to follow it now I would appreciate it more."
271,"NCIS is one of my favourite serial and I am watching it over internet. I was just watching 3th season 23th period. Gibbs getting hurt because of an explosion in a Turkish flag ship. And while David and Dinozzo talking to the captain there were only one Turkish word, it was ""orospu"" and we are not spelling it as ""oruspi"". I just want writers to be careful while writing about nations which they don't know. We are TURK not Arab and we are using Turkish and Turks are one of the nation whom can speak English without accent, Türkiye is one of the allied nation to States but when you act like we are Arab you are losing so much point in here and you are making us laugh to your ignorance... By the way may be next time you will need this information: we are using Latin Alphabet...."
272,"I am not sure why this title is not getting 10/10 rating because I can't really get enough of it! The characters, all of them will always have a fan out there, Gibbs as a character has always inspired me, especially when not mixing emotions regardless of how the situation is. The show's writers have done a wonderful job, to create and compress a 40 minute thriller on TV. The way the show starts cannot be imitated, short and precise. Though lots of fiction is involved with tech gigs around, it hasn't come to be a boring or a predictable show to me. NCIS encompasses all forms of crimes and despite the show being short, they try to show all the stages, errors made in the investigation makes the show 'believable'."
273,"I gave this show a perfect 10. The reason for that is simple, there aren't many shows that after five, six, seven or more seasons remain as good as the were at the start of their showing, but NCIS is only getting better. The writing is exceptional, the casting for the roles was perfect, every character is unique and the actors perform exceptionally. Every episode brings something new to the table and makes viewers to nervously wait for the next one. Also, I believe that agent Fornell should get more air time, his character fits perfectly with Gibbs which was nicely shown in the last episode.This show is a great mix of humor and action with some serious notes, hopefully it will remain on air for very long time."
274,"I just started watching NCIS & it's starting to grow on me. A lot of it has to do with the Ziva David character & plot line. The ""Good Cop Bad Cop"" episode was great & has earned NCIS another fan (me).I've become very slowly interested in this show because it is sometimes difficult for me to follow the plots. Dialogue can provide clues but the lines are sometimes mumbled so I have to watch my recordings of the show a couple of times to piece together what people are saying & what clues are presented. Otherwise, when I catch on to what is happening I realize I've enjoyed figuring out the threads & in the end the stories are pretty good.Again, I like the Ziva David character a lot. I've spent many years watching shows that really lacked a strong female character and I'm tired of getting frustrated when they are supposed to be strong but end up missing every target they shoot at & the male lead comes in and ""rescues"" them at the end. Not so here & I want whoever is responsible to know I appreciate it - keep up the good work & thank you for continuing to include Ziva in the show - I just hope you keep her character responsible & true - she has the potential to be a pretty good female role model (like Benson in Law & Order SVU). BTW, IMO a romance with DiNozzo would not be a good idea right now. Teasers are okay but I think the only time that could/should potentially happen is if they decided to finish off the series....which I hope doesn't happen for quite a while."
275,"I do not usually make comments on shows/movies but since so few people had commented on NCIS, I felt compelled to let people know that this is a pretty good show. It's not in the Great category, but each and every episode is very enjoyable, good writing, good acting and visually very pleasing. Mark Harmon is solid and his character has good interplay with the other main characters. Di Nozzo and Kate create some of the shows best moments. But like someone else has mentioned, I enjoy what Abby's character brings to the show. I have only watched the first season, but look forward to the next few seasons. I don't watch many shows on TV, I usually wait for the DVD's and watch a season from start to finish.Two other extras the I like in the show are David McCallum who I have not seen since one of my favorite shows as a kid (Man from U.N.C.L.E) and I live near Pax River and this location was featured in a few shows, though I'm sure not shot at this location. One funny moment for me was the incorrect directions given to ST. Mary's State Park in one of the episodes.I highly recommend this show !"
276,"Donald Bellisario has had a generally good track record of TV shows he's produced: ""Magnum P.I."",""Quantum Leap""(one of my faves!),""J.A.G."" and currently this show,a spin-off of ""J.A.G.""Being a former MArine,Bellisario continues to use the Navy/Marines as a backdrop for the action,this time centering on the investigation unit of the Naval police. They're headed by Gibbs(MArk HArmon,aging fantastically),a former MArine,current caffeine addict and perennial grouch. His crew includes DiNozzo(Michael Weatherly),a smug,horny wise-ass with a seeming lack of sense in social situations,Cate Todd(Sasha Alexander),an attractive,no-nonsense academy alum,Ziva(Cote de Pablo),Cate's replacement,a former ISrtaeli soldier and assassin,McGee(Sean Muray),a tech-nerd with a good heart,Abby(Pauley Perrete,fantastic and beautiful!),a bubbly Goth(!)who's a whiz in the forensics lab,and Ducky MAllard(David McCullum),the ME,a wise and sardonic Scotsman. Each episode centers around some crime that affects somebody(or bodies)of the Corps or Navy. This show moves at a brisk pace and the investigative process wraps a little too neatly sometimes,but this is still a very intriguing watch."
277,"I normally watch the US series NCIS to drool over the delectable Pauley Perrette, who plays Abby Sciuto, the show's Goth Forensic Medical Officer  I keep waiting for Abby to ""come out"" and start a steamy on-screen affair with Caitlin Todd, the other female character, played by Sasha Alexander, or with Ziva David in the latest series (who is a self-confessed bi-girl).However I guess my dream will never be realized. I was saddened by the most recent episode which involved the murder of a young female naval officer in a copycat of a ""cold case,"" in which the victim had been raped and had a trident symbol carved into her neck. The contemporary murder was committed by the victim's lesbian lover  she had stolen a sample of the original perpetrator's semen and inserted it into her dead lover to make it APPEAR that the perpetrator of the first murder had returned. However she tripped herself up  what she didn't know was that the original ""perp"" was dead. Hmmmmm, rather artificial it seemed to me! What upsets me as a lesbian is how we are always portrayed on the screen as crazy, with our life-options limited to suicide or homicide, but never happiness. The idea is to make us ""repent"" of our ""sins,"" either through religious conversion or psychiatric treatment before some disaster overtakes us and all around us. It is interesting to speculate why this cliché of the Dead/Evil lesbian is so urgently impressed into our psyche.Lesbianism is treated differently from male homosexuality. Gays are now 'acceptable' to many people, especially to straight women, for whom they have long been conscious or unconscious allies in the 'battle' against the grossness of the average straight male. Gay men raise few eyebrows as sympathetic protagonists, or even as the ""heroes"" of movies and TV series.Yet, lesbians are still personae non gratae. Why is this so? It seems to me that lesbianism actually strikes a DEEPER fear in our society than male homosexuality. After all, we know that men are disgusting creatures who will stick their members into any and every available hole. Therefore, male homosexuality has become a somewhat harmless peccadillo, a case of 'boys will be boys.' Women, however, are the 'seed-bearers,' both physical and cultural ... for a woman NOT to want to be a straight wife and mother seems to be quite frightening to mainstream society  indeed it is felt to challenge the very nature of the Universe. Any inclination toward such a choice, therefore, has to be suppressed at all costs.To this I might add that we lesbians have few allies  straight women fear us, and straight men either regard us as rivals, or as ""lost souls"" in need of ""conversion,"" especially by them. EWWWWWWWWWW!"
278,"I am a huge NCIS fan. I have never missed and episode.
Charles Durning in this episode was as always fantastic. He is one of the ultimate character actors to ever come out of Hollywood. He was a great person in life and a true war hero in WW II. 
I have probably a dozen what I feel are my favorite NCIS episodes. This one is always in the top 2 because of Durning"
279,"So I love this show. Probably my favorite. I haven't seen all the episodes. But I've been keeping up. I'm sad that some of the main characters have left. But I just want to say that I like Kasie. You can't replace Abby, but Kasie does a good job. I had the pleasure of meeting Diona this afternoon! She seems like such a sweet person!"
280,"This show is the best ever! The cast is amazing and so is the storyline and characters! Perfectly written!!! I have to admit that I am completely obsessed with this show. I love every factor of the show. Every actor and actress is amazing...especially Lauren Holly. The writers do an amazing job! So does the crew and actors! There is no better show out there in my opinion. It's just awesome! I love the interaction between the characters. The relationship between Jenny and Gibbs was amazing! Tony and Ziva's interaction were great! I do miss Ziva and Cote so much, but Ellie and Emily are wonderful! I love watching the show! It is my favorite! I just love everything about NCIS the show!"
281,"When I tuned in to watch the show last night, I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out. Much to mu surprise, it was a good episode, especially the behavior and bonding father and son went through during the show. The show lacked a little something, but it kept my attention until the very end which makes it a good show.I was a bit confused when Gibbs commented that he always sacks out on the couch-what's with that!I'm hoping to hear Gibbs come up with some new rules this season.Looking forward to the next episode."
282,"It's a story. Well, like all other television shows. This is a phenomenal show that contains humor, romance, mystery and drama all mixed into the perfect combination. Personally, I did not care for Kate, and enjoyed watching her get killed every time the show is on. I believe Ziva (Cote de Pablo) is a better fit for the show, connecting with Gibbs (Mark Harmon) on a deeper, more emotional level. Tony (Michael Weatherly) is the primary subject to bring comic relief, often relishing it onto McGee (Sean Murray). Abby (Pauley Perrette) and Ducky (David McCallum) are excellent additions to the major cast, adding to the social diversity. It's an outstanding show from CBS and has a special place in my heart, having sentimentally attached to it. If you have not watched this series yet, it's definitely not too late.I truly will be sad when the show pulls the curtains on its' final season."
283,"Just finished viewing the season finale. The two hour finale was excellent. Complex and compelling. An excellent ""who done it"" theme. The good guys and the bad guys seemed to be interchangeable. Super writing. But WHY oh WHY have you dumped Tony, Ziva and McGee. Or have they opted out? I understand Jenny leaving, no problem. I think the new Director will create positive tension between Gibbs and he.(Him?) He'll be a stronger presence than Jenny. and more of a challenge for the entire team. Ziva added an interesting dimension and was an interesting, if not fully developed, character. She will be missed, but was certainly dispensable. Altho McGee wasn't a powerful presence, his by-play with Tony was great. And his technical proficiency and touch of ""nerdiness"" added yet another dimension. But no Tony????? That's like losing Abby. Or Ducky. His wit and his ogling every woman in every episode, masked the fact he was actually an excellent agent. This has become my favorite series, and I hope Gibbs' new team can live up. Will anxiously look forward to the announcement."
284,"This TV Show has always been amazing and I'm sure that it always will be. From the original cast, to cast who have joined the team along the way, the acting has been staggering. I definitely will always recommend this show, from season 1 episode 1, to the current season 16, it has been an amazing journey. Many have come to dislike the show and claimed it's pointless to watch when their favourites from the original cast, had left, however that is the journey! It makes it better. They will be missed, but trust me, new cast grows on you. <3 And the show has always been what it was set out to be."
285,"I tried not to read reviews when working my way through the series from scratch. Catching a slight spoiler here and there, I feared I might not like the show with changes I knew were on the horizon. Let's face it; the show is simply written and produced so well, that it survived each change and just gets better. The writers and cast know they face a risk losing long-held high ratings, and the overcome those challenges by doing what has always worked. Maybe I'm the odd one out, but I missed Kate in the beginning. I didn't care for the new agent, Ziva there for a while either. But then, I grew to like her a lot. I'd rather they had her loosen up a bit and form a real relationship with Tony. When she left, the show survived quite well without her. Love Tony though, and wish he and Gibbs had more father/son moments and he kept things lively. Some of my friends got too annoyed with his character, but it provided a good basis for deeper relationships with his NCIS family.Then comes Bishop and I disagreed with comments regarding her, and sort of like her much better now. The new members did not have a glorious entry, but I now think that was by design. The new folks in 14 were not replacements. I feel like 14 returned to some of its' earlier content that hooked us in the beginning. I'm not a McGee fan, but this season, I grew to really like his character more, seeing the more vulnerable side. I know I will have to grieve another member leaving in 15 and I won't get ahead of myself. Each time I've worried about turnover, I was pleasantly rewarded by excellent writing, character development and the stability Gibbs offered. For those that chose to move on, it's their loss. I see (or hope to) this show continuing for another few years.New challenges, faces, personalities has never hurt this show's quality. On its' bad days, it still blows the New Orleans and Los Angeles spinoffs that just don't have that magic about it. If you are a long standing fan of the series, don't turn your back on the rest of the NCIS gang, and stick with it. Keep an open mind. You will likely feel something familiar - a subtle return to the beginning episodes that got us hooked in the first place. Keep up the great work team!"
286,"I think Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon) must like Jimmy Buffett since he's always building boats. Look it up on ""License to Chill"". I'm a ""parrot head"" and former sailor myself so I can understand. If the sea don't make you sick you're hooked for life. LOL I survived several tours in the Navy on a DDG. Wasn't always pretty. I never puked but I stood in some disgusting stuff while I used the head. Thank the Lord for high top paratrooper boots. Hurricane David in 1979 was my worst experience. I nearly blew chunks on that one. 2 days in a hurricane will do a number on you. So we only ate sandwiches because bread, saltine crackers, and Dramamine would let you survive that crap. Was it nasty? Hell yes! Our ""sister"" ship (DDG18) decided to sail into the eye of the hurricane. When we pulled back into Charleston, SC her main deck was stripped and they took more than a dozen injured into waiting ambulances. I wasn't even 19 but I remember it like it was yesterday. BTW I'm 55 now. My ship (DDG11) and I were conceived at roughly the same time. The poor old lady was retired long before me and has been recycled. I supposed I will be too in the near future. Thanks for a great TV show."
287,"I was very disappointed in the elimination of Sasha Alexander from the series. I felt her performance was superb and that her character a.k.a, Kaitland Todd was beginning to warm up to Tony DiNozo.I feel that by abolishing her role from the series is an affront to women in general because it makes them feel that their qualifications are not as good as men in this particular field. Sasha Alexander strength in character serviced as a good role model for women, especially young women in general in encouraging them to become members of the N.C.I.S team. She portrayed a strong woman who could stand her ground against sexual harassment instead of behaving like a ""big old crybaby"" who runs to her supervisor with every little complaint"
288,"I think the cases have to solve the Gibbs and his team again and again, very interesting. The consequences are extreme, and come over to scene believable. Gibbs with his dry humor is even worth it to look at the consequences. Gibbs and coffee, which is composed of pitch and sulfur, and woe to anyone accidentally spilled his coffee. Again and again, DiNozzo and his exhilarating Fettnäpchen in which it occurs again and again. Especially when he's angry McGee, or tried to ägern Caitlin Todd. Gone is the dance of Abby and McGee is always good for a laugh, or when standing in front of Gibbs and McGee stutters because he is afraid. And do not forget Jimmy Palmer is behaving like an idiot sometimes. The individual Chraktere are very well done, except for Ziva David, NCIS is the ugly issue of Kelly Bundy. I'm missing Caitlin Todd, as she put Ziva David is by far in the shade. I personally find the show well and they'll look me in the future, preferably without Ziva David."
289,Easily the worst show of all time so repetitive every episode feels like an episode already aired so it sucks and the acting is bad
290,"I don't need to explain anything other than the entire production sucks. There are gobs upon gobs of continuity errors and deus ex machina through out every single episode. It baffles me that criminals don't know already that if you go to ""talk"" to the investigators that you don't just say ""I plead the 5th. Where is my phone call so I can speak to my lawyer"". And when a lawyer does show up they are incompetent."
291,"I am appalled at the constant, every 5 or 10 minutes of sexual harassment of women in the workplace by DiNozzo. Are there no workplace anti sexual harassment laws in the US? In Europe a leering scumbag like DiNozzo would be summarily fired. The whole saga and indignation of #metoo last year and yet Hollywood loves creating garbage like this. And the women actresses agree with it. Unbelievable!!"
292,"I was amazed at the constant sexism coming from DiNozzo towards his colleagues. With all the #metoo cases and yet actresses agreeing to work in productions that are just geared towards men leering at women. Unbelievable.
As long as women keep accepting this, the culture won't change in Hollywood."
293,"This criminal series is packed with action and will have you on the edge of your seat, crying your heart out, laughing buckets and spending hours in front of the tv. I loved every minute of it!"
294,"Update: I'm now caught up on the show and I agree with most of the other reviews. I really loved the show but once Tony left it went downhill. The new characters are flat, dull and one dimensional. One of my favorite things about the show was the humor in most episodes, either Tony or Fornell always made me laugh, that is gone now. I just don't see this show coming back to where it was.
.......I am only on season 3 of the show and I really enjoy it. My favorite character was special agent Todd, and I really do miss her. I am not a fan of the Ziva David character at all and think Abby is ridiculous but tolerable. Gibbs is cranky but a great character, Ducky, Tony, and McGee are also really good. Overall I really enjoy it."
295,"A rare accomplishment: Highly forgettable but still entertainingThis serie is a kind of rarity IMO. An example of successful entertainment, despite a lot of weaknesse. I've seen most seasons, but frankly I don't care for any of its main figures, I just was able to develop some sympathies for McGee, as for the other, IMO all of quite limited likeability. It doesnt really matter if they come and go, and with new characters you just can note if they are more or less annoying.
Nevertheless the serie has a interesting balance. Always some action, the CSI part in the lab is not overdrawn and the episodes while mostly standalone, catching enough with its not far-fetched plot. And without useless, counterproductive attempts to make it more ""attractive"" with excessive brutality, nuditiy or rough language.
This series delivers solid entertainment with decent settings, but without any potential to make it memorable. A rare event, 6/10 for that."
296,"Ant wait for Ellie to be taken off the show. I enjoyed her when she first came on the show however she has become a very judgmental, hypocritical, and arrogant character. I don't care for her I'm better then you mentality."
297,Hello I'm map and happy to work white and hopefully can friendly find out.
298,NCIS has everything. It shows complicated relationships with such ease. Cases are good but I like the chemistry of the team best.
299,"I absolutely love the series and have watched it many times. I know Melinda McGraw was casted as her, however in season 1 or 2 Tobias is married and another woman is depicted as that woman.WHO IS THAT WOMAN?"
300,"Question....Abbeys lab windows SURE look like the old LaVerne & Shirley show of the 70s.....(60s????)
L & S walked down steps from their front door to the lower level...with the same windows Abbey has in her lab.I cant find proof of my theory. Anyone else know?"
301,"I do love this show. I have only two negative comments.
First, Tim McGee is supposed to be an Eagle Scout and steeped in nature lore. But twice, in early episodes, he does not recognize poison ivy. Poison ivy is fairly recognizable andeven Tony knew it.
Second, as much as I love the show, the only original cast member is Mark Harmon and an occasional appearance by David McCallum. Sigh. It might be time to hang up the seabag and concentrate on the Los Angeles and New Orleans shows."
302,What episode did Gibbs & McGee go to LA to visit the NCIS LA team
303,"Even though some connection Is to fast, fun to watch"
304,"Last night's episode shows their writers still have what it takes to write good TV. History, racism, dishonor, betrayal, love, guilt, forgiveness, it hit a lot of high notes. Well done, NCIS."
305,I love this show even though the took away tony and zeva smh. It's still great.
306,Hie im from new zealand just watched the latest tonight 04/09/2018 you guys im 48 i havent cryd for 32 years. I have watched u guys from day one. U take now to make me cry. Well i say keep up the gd work n gibbs u r the man the rock of ncis u guys rock keep up the good work. Russ from new zealand. The best rugby team in the world
307,"Sorry but this series is the best series in the two times 2000-2009 and 2010-2019. No other series have this mark. In my eyes CSI Las Vegas was first but this series comes down as William Petersen left his role.I search a second series but I don't find this. All of I see is in the times 90er, 80er, 70er, 60er, but in our time is nothing.NCIS is only this series I see in the actually time."
308,"""Gibbs and Family""Before Gibbs lost his family, he was living the good life.
what was it?"
309,Every season I expect it to drop in quality or get boring/repetitive but it never does. Harmon is a dang Ironman who can somehow make the show work no matter the cast around him. I wish Tony was still on but it's still a great show!
310,"Thought the series would die after michael weatherley left but has continued with great scripts and brilliant acting , it's a must to watch"
311,I love this shows & it is one of my favorites as I am a U.S. MARINE myself. Tony should have never been on the show in the first place so I was extremely happy when he left the show although I wish they would've killed the character off. Most people not in the military do not realize how close to reality the show is as far as jurisdiction is concerned. When a U.S. MARINE or a navy member or a coast guard member is involved JAG & NCIS always have jurisdiction & if it's an army member the army CID always has jurisdiction. This is even when it involves VETS a lot of the time. The F.B.I. & any other agency does not & cannot override any of this.
312,"Good Morning !!! I'm from Brazil and I love the NCIS series. This series, even, has a high popularity rating here. I can say that, at least among my friends, the people love Gibbs and his team. Well, that's not why I write. I write yes, to suggest: Or a special epsódio (that can be divided in first and second chapters); or a feature film (after all, it's all over the clock, from NCIS, Gibbs and his team to have a movie in theaters around the world), holding a meeting between Leroy Jethro Gibbs and Captain and Detective Steve McGarrett Hawaii 5.0), considering the affinity between both: the solution of complex cases; action and for both to be Marines, it would be interesting to meet these two (two) teams, which, in addition to being unpublished, would be historical, entering into the annals of the seventh art. This time, thank you for your attention, and thank you very much for the approval of my idea."
313,"such a fantastic series. even with the cast changes throughout the years, I am happy to say that this show and its fantastic cast and crew provide entertainment week in week out 14 seasons and still counting. I am looking forward to seeing more from the wonderful cast and crew I am also looking forward to the rest of season 14 and season 15."
314,"Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon) leads an NCIS team investigating crimes connected to the Navy. Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette) is the goth forensic girl. Donald Mallard (David McCallum) is the medical examiner with Jimmy Palmer (Brian Dietzen) as his assistance. Caitlin Todd (Sasha Alexander) joins Timothy McGee (Sean Murray) and Anthony DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly) on the team. Caitlin is killed at the end of the second season and eventually replaced by Ziva David (Cote de Pablo) who would also be replaced after a long run. Leon Vance (Rocky Carroll) and Jenny Shepard (Lauren Holly) are a couple of their bosses at various times.This long-running spin-off of JAG is highly successful having built a large loyal following. It's unlikely to run out of steam until Mark Harmon decides to quit. This is a fine police procedural which can expand to bigger stories due to its connection to the Navy. Mostly, it thrives on the group's chemistry. It ran into a bump early on with Sasha Alexander's departure. With the arrival of Cote de Pablo, the group chemistry got better than ever. Her departure was another bump but it wasn't until Michael Weatherly's departure that the chemistry is truly endangered. His humorous devilous character is a main anchor and I noticed a real struggle with the new characters. No matter what, this train is unlikely to stop any time soon."
315,"Many memories, the show sucks you in and its perfect! From the first season NCIS has showed amazing story line and something that just exploded over the seasons and years. My favorite female actor was definitely Kate in the unfortunately just 2 seasons that she played in, and my favorite male actor is the godlike Gibbs! NCIS had me crying more then anytime ever in my life and laughing more then ever before, the drama and comedy is on point in every scene. Now that both Ziva and Tony ""left"" and a total of 4 new actors started playing in the show it looks even more interesting although I thought it might lose the coolness but its even better now!"
316,"Tony would be pleased it takes two people to replace him! Loving the new special agents. And what a delight to have Jennifer Esposito back on prime time! Welcome back Jennifer. You were missed. Wilmer Valderrama's character of Nick Torres is interesting. It will certainly be exciting to see him interact with the veteran cast. Long way from Fez. I am glad the new season finally arrived.I believe David McCallum once said, ""as long as there is life in David, there will be life in Duckie"". As long as there is an NCIS, I will watch.Welcome back guys!"
317,"Yes, this is the 2nd best show on TV (The Good Wife being the best)and all is good, but the music is still too loud and this is not the only show this happens to (Elementary also comes to mind and some others I cannot recall now) Can something be done? There is also something wrong when one has to comply and write 10-lines. This is not right.There is also something wrong when one has to comply and write 10-lines.

This is not right.There is also something wrong when one has to comply and write 10-lines. This is not right."
318,"I'm not sure if this will be a spoiler for those who have just started watching, but it was a great show and still is, but I personally preferred Special Agent Catherine ""Kate"" Todd instead of Ziva David. I know that it was Sasha Alexander's choice to leave the show, but Donald P. Bellisario could have not let her out of her contract early. It is a great show still, but I miss Kate and I got emotionally attached to the characters and when Kate died, I spent a couple of days crying and it really sucked. I still go back to the first two seasons just to see Kate and Tony together again because I personally think that they should have dated. (just my opinion) But this show is great and amazing, I just wished Kate was still alive."
319,"Hi. i'm a big fan of the show, i really like it but i can't find an episode that i really like and as you know this series has a lot of seasons and i don't know where to start. The episode is a girl who dies because she threw herself up onto the bus. she was very smart and she for a company and then ha they start to investigate the case they found more about this girl for example her teacher and then ABBY starts to get crazy about all the things that surround this girl and finally they found that it was her friend form the company, the person who she works with. this is the episode if someone find it please say something because i really want to know."
320,"Ducky Mallard (a play on the name for a male duck), portrayed by the debonair actor and heartthrob, David McCallum (of The Man from Uncle fame or Illya Kuryakin), plays the part of a consummate professional in NCIS (Naval Criminal Investigative Services). He serves in some ways as the resident staff psychiatrist and Dear Abbey (lol as there is a character on NCIS named Abbey) because he is asked for, and reluctantly, gives appropriate advice to his colleagues. His belief in justice sometimes causes him to break the rules in his role as pathologist (Anpilova, 2006). Who could he hurt by accidentally losing a body so a dead marine's wife can honor his final wishes? One episode of NCIS smacks of The Man Who Would Be King, a 1975 film adapted from the Rudyard Kipling's short story of the same name. Ducky describes his travels to the Pacific and escaping certain death by treating a tribal Chief's wife for candida (Anpilova, 2006). By the way, in The Man From UNCLE, Kuryakin's arch enemy is an agency called THRUSH.In The Man Who Would be King, Sean Connery is relegated to status of a god by the Kifiris, when he is not killed by an arrow and has possession of a Masonic token (Wiki, n.d.). Connery actually develops delusions of grandeur and believes that he is deserving of this status, but not for long. Connery was happy to be deified by the Kifiris and the Kafiris were delighted to deify him to affirm their faith. The consequences for Connery's hubris occurs similarly in all societies That is the exalted one is spurned when not able to live up to societal expectations of them (Fernie, n.d.). Which is do not be human. Anymore and this will be a spoiler of this epic John Huston movie.Back to NCIS, another medical reality that is depicted, is that Ducky lived with his aged mother who was suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD). Ducky was left on a bus by his mother and though absent mindedness is not necessarily a precursor to AD, depressive symptoms are. Her inattention may correspond to (AD) if caused by Major Depressive Features (Potter & Steffans, 2007). Regarding suicide, he berates a psychiatrist for a completed suicide when a suicidal patient was not on watch through the night (Anpilova, 2006). References Anpilova, A. (2006).

321,"NCIS is a pure police procedural. Its sole distinguishing feature from other entries in the genre is its unusual setting. This setting--in and around Navy and Marine Corps facilities and hardware--was the only thing I found appealing about the show, but it's such a powerful and pervasive appeal that I found myself not minding the time I spent watching the two episodes that I tried.From what I saw, the characters are pretty thin, not much more than stereotypes, so if you're attracted to drama with well-rounded, three-dimensional characters, you won't be finding it here.I suspect that much of the show's appeal comes purely from its story lines as the protagonists attempt to connect clues and solve crimes. In this respect, the show seemed competently handled to me, but I'm not familiar enough with the genre to compare it to much.One final note: there's a good dose of sexism in this show, mostly in the lines given to Michael Weatherly's character Anthony DiNozzo. This goes pretty much unchecked, even by characters that portray highly skilled and professional women. The show gives a free pass and even tacit approval to this kind of thing, which I found disappointing.I'd probably watch NCIS if I were stuck somewhere and it was on the screen, but I wouldn't go seeking it out."
322,"I am not as a rule a fan of American crime series, but this one is an exception. It has a nice balance of drama and humour, the characters are all entertaining and the interaction between them I think makes the series. I used to be a Crime scene investigator so it's probably this that caught my interest initially, the crime scene technicalities are a bit sci-fi but never the less fun to watch. This applies to both branches of the series, the Los Angeles version being a bit more Hollywood for my liking but still entertaining. The main characters are well established now, and some come and go to keep the storey lines fresh. All in all the series does stand out against the myriad of other crime series from America , And will continue to watch it. Tony."
323,I am a great fan of NCIS and all the characters. Pauley Perette reminds me of Henry Winkler on Happy Days. His character started out rather non descriptive and turned into one of the major stars of the show thanks to the unselfish nature of Ron Howard. I suspect that Mark Harman has done the same for her character. I am concerned that the show may be becoming a kind of Soap Opera as so many long running shows became. It's difficult to keep coming up with new ideas each week. I really enjoy the light hearted comedy that is interjected into the series and I would not want to see it disappear. I might add that the character played by Rocky Caroll does not seem to add anything to the show. Perhaps it's time to promote him.Harry Pfendler
324,"Sirs: I recently discovered, from an article in ""USA Weekend,"" that Cote de Pablo is a trained singer who studied musical theater at Carnegie Mellon University. In her own words, ""My dream was to be an opera singer. I didn't get there."" It would be wonderful if an episode were to be created (perhaps one concerning the murder of a serviceman music lover that takes place during an opera performance) that would require the exquisite Cote de Pablo to use her cunning to help solve the crime by exhibiting her recently discovered (by me, at least) beautiful operatic singing voice.What a double treat for the listening audience!
