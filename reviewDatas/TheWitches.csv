1,"What the F... is Going on? Im a norwegian, and one of the best things about the original, is that the beginning is set in norway. Bergen. The story about the girl in the painting. Dahl had norwegian parents, so i really love the beginning of the original.Why do the keep making terrible remakes of really good movies? The make up in the original is far surperior to the terrible CGI in this movie. If you check out the drawings in the book, the Grand witch is way off in this movie. The CGI is more like the Scorpion King.That someone in the comments gave this movie 7-10 is just nuts. So incredible bad"
2,"Do not waste your time just watch the classic original which still looks anazing today 30 years later , mainly cos of the acting and practical effects and because it was so darn sinister for a children's movie .Anne Hathaway cast as the grand high witch is a massive miscasting if their ever was one , her supposed german accents goes from russian to Scottish all in one sentence .Who the hell thought choosing second rate CGI effects over animatronics and make up clearly is missing the point on what made the original movie so iconic and scary , the CGI mice were like someat a student at film college could of made on some free app on android... Octavia Spencer was so over the top camp , Chris rocks voice over was overly excited considering he is narrating a story that is about evil withches and the danger they pose towards children ..The whole film was so badly miscast it makes showgirls look like pride and prejudice, Hollywood u have to stop now remaking classic movies , come up with some new ideas and make new movies diverse. We do not need to erase iconic movies from the past just to tick the diversity quota , make new movies new ideas and just be diverse ....Anne Hathaway really should be kept away from icnonc roles like this. It's actually angered me at how bad this film is. Enough already"
3,Total tripe from start to finish. The only one good thing about this movie is Anne. The CGI is shockingly bad and cartoonish. A British story set in Britain that's been Americanised and therefore completely ruined. Hideous doesn't even come close to describe this movie.
4,"The remake has no story line, no emotional connections to the characters. Nothing compared to the original and yes you should be comparing. The only good actress in this film is Anne Hathaway who did alright. The director should be ashamed. What a waste of money and talent. I'm going to go have some Cress soup and enjoy the rest of my night watching the original version. More talent in just the pinky of that movie."
5,"This re-make of the witches is very short and very simplified from the original adaptation of the film. The cast doesn't seem entirely engaged in their roles. Too much auto-tone and CGI used here to the point that it's not as effective as one might hope it to be. Very bland sets and much smaller scale compared to the original version. Ultimately, this is just another bland Hollywood low budget re-make film."
6,This was horrible I can't believe they would remake this amazing classic and cast Anne Hathaway at the grand high which. No offense to her she's an OK actress but this was not a role for her. This was Anjelica Huston's part it's like could you imagine anyone else playing Morticia Addams? And also no offense to Chris rock but the narration was no Bueno
7,"The Grand High Witch is killing it. but seriously, she's terrible.
From the start on, with the weird Chris Rock voice-over, this remake goes wrong wherever it can wrong. The acting is stiff, the focus is hardly on all the other witches, the CGI is not good. Even the housekeeping cart seems to come from the CGI box. Positive thing: Octavia Spencer is doing her best to be a genuine grandmother, and she succeeds, but that's about it.
OK, yes, I am a fan of the 1990 movie. Even though it wasn't as close to the original story, I really can't believe Roald Dahl would recognize his book in this mess. The first movie was gorgeous in it's authenticity. It has folklore, it has an edge, it has a heart. This is Hollywood factory work and seems to want to be much more than it can deliver. It made me miss much more than the purple glow in the witches eyes. It made me want to just throw up like a witch who smells children.
I'm not saying you shouldn't watch it. I am sure that an entire generation who never grew up with the original will disagree, but to me, this is like cursing in a church. It's horrible."
8,"This whole movie is a mess! The cast all seem very dis-interested in their roles. The plot is a shot by shot re-make of the original and overall, I don't feel like there is any spirit or enthusiasm in this project at all! Don't recommend at all! Skip it and watch the original more engaging version of the film!"
9,"There is going to be a lot of unemployed actors in Hollywood, very soon.Is there anyone left who understands the public mood?"
10,"I love Octavia and Anne, but this movie seems like it was rushed and that they were just phoning it in.To begin with, the original is a cult classic, so how dare you mess up with it. Then, if you are gonna do it, well, do it well. They were clearly going for a kids friendly movie but I mean, this story is creepy. The mouse animation takes you away from it, specially coming from Henson's animatronics. The Great Witch reveal is underwhelming, and the changes/additions to the story don't serve it. It just doesn't adds up.It pains me that Cuaron and Del Toro are attached to this project as producers. Zemeckis seems to be going in decline and it just sucks. Dahl's fans may be happier with this ending, but with all the other changes I dunno how they can be happy with the movie in general."
11,I just don't get it??? Why do producers think it's a good idea to re-make an already fabulous movie????? WHY???? Why not remake a movie that should have been good and wasn't!?
12,The original was better. They should of just left this movie alone all together
13,Anne Hathaway can't hold a candle to Angelica Houston and neither can the rest of cast against their 1990 counter parts. Zemekis's direction is bland and unimaginative. Avoid.
14,Worst remake so far. Don't waste yours or you kids time. Just watch the original
15,"Some 80s and 90s family movies look incredibly cheesy and bad compared to modern releases... Well, now we have the opposite! The 90s adaptation is a masterpiece compared to this. It's incredible how many talented people worked on this mess. The cringiest thing about it is Anne Hathaway's accent, which jumps from Russian to German to Swedish, and it's never funny because she's trying too hard.
There are many other talking animal movies that your children will enjoy, spare them, and don't succumb to the voice in your head asking ""how bad can it be?"". IT'S REALLY BAD."
16,"What they end up doing in this movie makes the film less of a movie and more of a commercial for something stupid , if you see the film you will know what I'm talking about. It was cute and fun. But NOT at all a good movie nor a classic. It's barely considered a movie. Not sure what audience this movie would even appeal to. I would skip this and either read the book or watch the original movie instead. Not worth the time!!"
17,"I've not written a review before on here, but I felt compelled to after sitting through this film and wasting £15 for the privilege!
I didn't understand why they had to remake the witches, the original felt authentic and was engaging and fun. The grandma and little boy made a great team and you rooted for them! This one was boring in places, all the actors (except Octavia Spencer) were dreadful, the little boy especially! And Chris Rock as the voice over was annoying, at times you couldn't hear /understand what he was saying!
My children found it frightening, the way Anne Hathaway's mouth opened with those teeth and her extending arms was very much like the clown from IT and the CGI was so obvious. And what accent was she supposed to have? At times it was Scottish/Irish and some kind of Eastern European!!?
I wouldn't recommend it, stick with the original!"
18,"Terrible. The witches are pathetic, the original had over twice the amount in the hotel. Anne Hathaway WISHES she has the poise, energy and even the accent."
19,Nothing new nor exciting here at all! Makes sense why it's free to watch with hbo max subscription! Terrible re-make of a classic! Don't even waste your time!! BOO!
20,Again I ask...why?! Why God why?!?! These extra words are because my review is too short. How long does it need to be because there is nothing else to say about this basura. And just in case that is spanish for trash so if you do decide to watch it...you've been warned.
21,"So I wanted to like this and had some hopes for it, but it honestly fell pretty flat. I even thought that with actors like Octavia Spencer, Stanley Tucci and Anne Hathaway that it might be saved, and they were great in their roles as far as remaking/re-imagining movies go. But even with that, the grandmother is sort of a rehash of Spencer's character Minnie from The Help, Stanley Tucci hardly gets ANY screen time or character development, and Hathaway, while nailing so many of Angelica Houston's mannerisms, is still a bit overdone on her character. But also the remake lacks the character/story development, decent plot, dialogue and even the action and tense scenes from the original. And the transformation scenes (minus the one in the beginning which I thought was a good add) were extremely short with bad CGI. Overall, this was no improvement over the 1990 version, and not different enough to be all that good."
22,"Well, it seems any of these days someone in the Louvre Museum will paint Mona Lisa's face....Michelangelo's Davis will wake up missing a part of its anatomy... I have the impression that any of these days, people will start burning books, or that it will be acceptable to destroy any piece of art, literature and even scientific advances that does not conform to some form of acceptable collective thinking.The funny thing is that these remakes are, without exception, unimaginative toothless messes when compared to the originals.Can´t writers and directors come up with original ideas?"
23,This film is barley considered a movie... nothing more than eye candy. The film is not engaging enough for kids and not Sophisticated enough for adults. Not sure what audience it targets. Too main stream and actually kind of boring at parts! Don't recommend at all!
24,This was one of my favorite stories growing up. The old movie was not the best but good enough for the technology they had back then. I always dreamed of them remaking it! But lo and behold this was terrible. Everyones acting sucked and there was no good direction nor good effects. The cgi of the old film was actually better. Ahh they ruined it for me! Please don't pay to watch this movie.
25,"Yes you'll always have the the original movie or book were superior crowd no matter what but you have to give a movie a chance to be good, this falls short in a few ways imo. Firstly way too much too much attention is paid into the special effects without much focus on anything else.My gripes, the grandma, she's very cold at the start, doesn't fill you with the same sense of comfort the original grandma in the 1st mobiedid.Brunos parents, in the original movie you had a bit of dialogue from the father which gave you a sense of what type of person he is, this movie basically did nothing to create any type of other characters apart from the main onesThe hotel manager, in the original movie he was a bit of a snivelling stuck up so and so whos character you started to hate but he redeemed himself at the end, in this one the manager just looks confused and has no redeeming qualities at allAll in all a disappointment, the original set itself as a very dark childrens film where as this one was more focused on trying to be too dark than actually being so and just looked comedic at gimes, a shame because the story itself has so much potential"
26,"Just watched the remake of Roald Dahl's The Witches. It had so much potential but unfortunately falls flat with its over use of awful CGI effects. One for the kiddies but if you're a fan of the original classic, stick to it. Not even Anne and her terrible accent could save this toned down version!"
27,This film has too many messages and signs of racism present. I don't recommend this adaptation of the Roald Dahl story at all for the lack of creativity and political messages present. I prefer the 1990 classic family film. Skip this new adaptation!
28,"I'll admit that I had little to no hope for this one to begin with, at the risk of sounding like an old man drinking from a hip flask and muttering at innappropriate moments 'I miss the good old days.'Never before has that been more applicable than now.Lets begin with the goodit isnt a long movie.I guess that's it!Now for the bad!The addition of CG when used properly is seamless and adds an extra layer of depth to an already decent idea. Unfortunately as is the norm these days CG is used at the drop of a hat (or wig) because its simply the easier option. Remember the terrifying grand high witch transformation from the original film? now its a question of forget prosthetics or excellent makeup, or even excellent acting actually. You wont find it here!The CG snake was needless and looked awful, hire a real snake or use one of the crew members' pet snake, cheaper, easier and realistic. SIMPLE!The most irritating thing about this movie from the beginning is that it lacks any subtlety at all, which unfortunately makes it all completely unbelievable. If witches were obvious-and every single witch in this movie parades around with the subtlety of Donald Trump-then they would be easy to spot. Sometimes less is more, what you dont see can be infinitely more horrifying.The above bits are the least of this movie's problems. Now I am mixed race and love a cultural nod as much as the next person but again a little subtlety would be nice, yes the main characters are black and no problem with that at all in fact I welcome the change, however I dont need to be given a stereotypical view of a black family, We dont all like motown, we dont all like southern style food, i mean what was with that room service scene!?!?!? All it was missing was a sign saying Stereotypical Southern Black Woman's Order' , Please get away from this one size fits all model because its old and tired.Movie is set in the US, why? What was the point of doing that? Story is unchanged regardless of where it takes place but what difference did changing the setting to the US actually make? Other than filming it in America because it was convenient I cant think of any other reason for this.The actingOctavia Spencer is great I love the lady but shes the only good thing here.
Stanley Tucci plays the same character he plays in everything, the quirky one, it works for him and thats fine.
The kids are terrible and very irritating, at least the kids in the original had some likeability.
Anne Hathaway is awful, bad accent, hammy and just a farce overall. Very much a paint by numbers portrayal of the bad guy, cliché, robotic, silly really and not in a good way.I touched on it earlier but why is EVERYTHING CG!?!?
The terrible mouth of the Grand High Witch, the terrible CG mice, The transformations were pathetic and we had a CG wooden log!!!I ask you WHY!?Skip this Hammy dumpster fire"
29,"An awful lot of grumpy reviewers here.. Yes it's animation is a bit Stuart little/cartoony, and Anne Hathaway's accent is all over Europe.. but as remakes go it's well thought out and just plain Dahl-esque magical fun!I really enjoyed the 60's Deep South reimagining of where the story is set, and octavia spencer is always good as a sagely and wise older figure. The story is similar enough to be considered a remake, but the minor differences keep it interesting!It's been given the Hollywood treatment for sure, so it's far glossier/more polished than the original, but having just watched them back to back, unless it's just nostalgia you're after, then that's no bad thing I promise.Overall the quality of the story itself shines through, and if you just want to have some fun watching it then you will certainly do just that.If you're looking to review it for Oscar-worthiness then maybe reassess your expectations, chill out and grab a drink. It's a fantasy film people. Let the fantasy breathe!"
30,Awful.... why remake it the first one was great... the special effects are too much and take over the movie and they aren't actually that great.Don't watch this... enjoy the first one again instead
31,"""The Witches"" misses opportunities and makes me wonder why director Robert Zemeckis continues to make mediocre films. Take a break, Zemeckis.In this fantasy film set in 1968 Alabama, an orphaned young boy stumbles across a conference of witches while staying with his grandmother at a hotel. Based on the book by Roald Dahl.Aside from fun performances from Anne Hathaway and Octavia Spencer, ""The Witches"" relies too much on CGI, which in my opinion is making movies worse with every use. What happened to getting a real cat in a movie? Is it really about animal rights or more because Hollywood doesn't want to train an animal to sit on Anne Hathaway's forearm? Chris Rock as the narrator was a nice touch and the highlight of the film. Overall, I think Robert Zemeckis should take a break from making movies to find his groove again, because right now it's getting tired.Follow @snobmedia for all reviews!"
32,This film is a snooze and looks cheap and poorly made. Acting is bad and mediocre. Don't recommend it at all!
33,"Terrible, boring, and dull re-make of an already simple and stupid film and story. Don't recommend it at all, I suggest to watch the original version instead ! This terrible trash re-make is a waste of time!"
34,"Everything was being cool, until Anne's really exaggerated performance, maybe another actress would have been better choice"
35,The Witches had the potential to be an entertaining movie due to Anne Hathaway and Olivia Spencer but it is way too simple with lazy writing and in my opinion it has one of the worst endings seen in a film.When the parents of a boy are killed tragically in an accident in 1968 he ends up living with his grandmother who tells him that witches are real and are not even women but demons. They go to a hotel in Alabama and they have the misfortune to be there at the same time as a witch coven gathering. The witches have a plan to turn all children into mice and eliminate them. They turn the boy into a mouse and he together with two other children who were turned into mice and his grandmother had to defeat the coven led by the high witch. They do this by feeding the witches the same potion that was used to turn them into mice and it ends up turning the witches into ugly looking rats. And then they leave with a huge pile of money and potion and a list of all witches in the world and plan to turn them into rats as well. About 45 seconds is spent trying to turn the children back into their human form and then they shrug their shoulders and say well it's ok beeing a mouse. The boy even asks how long mice live and the grandmother says that regular mice live three years but that they might live three times that which is ok with the boy who is happy he won't have to go to school and they can die together. The grandmother doesn't seem to be too bothered either which is strange to say the least since the indication is that none of these poor children will see past their mid teens but at least they can have fun with all the money. And then they show us a scene 11 years later with an aged mouse talking to children and sending them out on a mission to eliminate witches. Obviously someone was not good at math since 1979 is about two years past the mice life span according to the film.Another issue is why does the potion work on witches who are not even human? Why doesn't the grandmother try to find an antidote when she captures the head witch instead of feeding her to her cat familiar. In the beginning it is said that a witch gets the same pleasure from squashing children as a normal person would from eating ice cream. And then 25 minutes later it is said they hate the smell of children since children smell like dog poop... soooo....dog poop ice cream that they get enjoyment out of squashing. Someone should have read through this script more. The good things are the effects and the adult actors although Anne Hathaway changes her accent throughout the movie. She was still entertaining but not enough to improve this movie which has a terrible ending. A 3 out of 10.
36,"What was this? There's complete no plot or storyline in this movie. Characters are just nowhere or without existance. An hotel that is empty of people, where is everyone? The high witch is the only one who talks or acts in this movie from the rest of the Witches group, the rest are just robots. I don't know who approved the script for this remake but should be fired inmediately. Where is the makeup? Where is the evilness? Where is the Witch? Both kids have more personality while they are mice than humans. When they are in human form they are so lame. But as mice they are cometely different in form and intentions. This is just trash."
37,Like Through the Woods and Cats this is another waste of time. So annoying I had to turn it off not even mid-way.
38,Was not worth the watch. What is up with the scars on their faces the point of the disguise is to not be able to recognize the witch without looking into their eyes if they're trying to remake the movie exactly as the first one which it seems like they are. Anne Hathaway is a great actress and they have a making a fool of herself with this accent . There are many other things with this movie wrong just skip this whole movie and watch the original this is not worth the watch!
39,"I really wanted to like this movie, I had high hopes after finding out Anne was cast. But it just failed in every aspect, weak cliché punchlines, terrible CGI for 2020, and most importantly no connection to the characters."
40,"I wanted to like this, the original adaption is one of my favourite films since first watching it as a child, however, this remake is a low budget CGI fest with cartoonish characters that rob the film of any potential to be scary or sinister. Forgettable with zero kindertrauma, they should have left it alone."
41,Way to ruin a British classic! And I say this as an American!
42,"What a shame, I think this one is another disaster of 2020"
43,"The original movie was fanatic it brings me so much nostalgia to watch it, I watch the new one it has some similarity but overall a complete different story really. In my opinion they over used CGI and the storyline was bland, what wrong with using Prosthetics like in the original. The story leaves you unfulfilled and not wanting more. Like many of the remake during the last few years it leaves a Sour taste in your mouth and you asking the question why?. Will these film producers instead of only think about making a quick buck, decide to make something new and with integrity, Their is plenty of source material, books, et. I think I speak for most people when I say if it not broke don't fix it"
44,"I don't get why everyone's calling this a remake. It's not a remake. It's another adaption of the book. I think people need to focus more on comparing the movie to the book rather than the 1990 movie. I will say that the 1990 movie was a lot darker and dramatic while this one is more comedic and light hearted but I never expected this to be a copy of the other movie since again, it's not a remake. Here are what I think are the pros and cons of the movie.Pros:Stayed more true to the book especially the ending, Anne's performance was amazing and I could tell she had fun with this role, I liked Daisy/Mary's story, the costumes were great especially the Grand High Witch's, loved the final battle feel between the grandma and the GHW, the beginning was really well done and emotional, loved the scene of the witches meeting especially the GHW's dialogue and the witches chasing after Luke, Mary and Bruno, even though she didn't have an unmasked form, I still liked what they did with the GHW's ""true look"" and still found it quite terrifying, loved Octavia's performance even though I felt that she was too young for the role.Cons:CGI was over the top, movie seemed a bit rushed, I didn't like the way the grandmother's backstory was played out, was confused as to why the GHW didn't have an unmasked form but I still liked what they did with it (I put that under both the pros and cons list because I was kinda disappointed but I still liked it), felt bad for Bruno's parents that they never got Bruno back, don't get why the main character is just labeled as ""Hero"" instead of Luke or some other name though I can't remember if he was given a name in the book.Overall, I think the biggest highlights of this movie was Octavia and Anne's performances and it staying more true the book than the 1990 movie did even though the time settings were different and they changed the races of the grandma and grandson but I don't mind that."
45,This movie feels very slow and stupid to the point I no longer have any interest to watch nor care about the characters or much or the story at all! Skip this in-interesting/ un-captivating CGI garbage! The original 1990 film is WAAAYYY better and more engaging film altogether. This film is too simplified and boring for me.
46,"I'm sure people will hate this movie no matter what because they love the original and I get that but it's not bad at all. My kids loved it and love the original so they actually pulled it off in my opinion. People may also find other ways or reasons to hate it (probably involves current issues politics bs etc.) but seriously it's not bad. You also have to remember these movies are kids movies based on a kids book so if your pissed that a movie from your childhood has been remade, that's sad. At least they waited 30 years to do it. The first one is a lot scarier but that's because of the awesome makeup and not cgi."
47,"I was surprised to the reaction to this film... It's completely inoffensive and does everything it needs to with the charm of grandma, the malice of the Grand High Witch, etc. I'm getting the feeling that these are reactionary responses to yet another 'bland and unoriginal Hollywood' trend even though this is an adaptation of Roald Dahl's book, just like the 1990 version is.It's alright if people don't like this movie I suppose but acting like it's the worst thing to come to screens is an exaggeration to say the least. Kids are most definitely going to enjoy it, it is for them after all, not the adults comparing it to the 1990 adaptation, so I'd say this film was a success in what if wanted to do."
48,"Everyone commenting on the film having a tone, I agree completely. It's almost as if a certain organization picked up this story and made their own version. I did not appreciate the politicially racial hints and undertones. Absolutely butchered a classic adding in topics have that no business in the remake of a kids movie that we're never there to begin with. The makers should be ashamed. And, I'm sorry, Anne Hathaway does not come close to pulling off the Grand High Witch, at most she could have played the assistant from the original. Very disappointed in the whole 'project'."
49,"I've never read the book nor saw the original. Sat down and watched it with the fam and wow, that was hot garbage. No character connection whatsoever. I thought Hathaway was horrible in every fashion. Definitely the worst movie she's ever done. She should never do an accent. Everything came across forced like she was reading something new from a piece of paper. Save yourselves from this garbage movie and read the thousands of 1 star reviews.."
50,If I had one wish in the world it would be to go back in time and never watch this movie lol the original is so good and this movie was just weird and disappointing. Ann Hathaways voice during the movie will bug any human on earth. It's like she is trying too hard to act and is just butchering the role. I really wish people stopped remaking movies that were good in the first place.
51,Wow! Garbage. Dreadful to watch Anne Hathaway do an accent. I wish I could get my 1 hour and 44 minutes back
52,"The remake was okay but much lighter in tone than its predecessor and the cheesy humor was kinda cringeworthy. I would've preferred a much darker spin and more sinister vibe over this comical TV movie offering but oh well. Octavia was really good as always but the cheap CGI did let the movie down. It's also been very clear for a number of years now that Anne's forte are not accents. I mean she sounded comical and even Scottish in certain parts...like girl come on now. It goes without saying that Anjelica Huston's performance was much stronger and scarier in the 1990 version, but overall the cast, sets and writing were okay."
53,"What a vile horrendous remake of the 90's movie that didn't need to be made,
Horrible CGI and terrible acting, amazing how they changed the characters race to make a big bold statement.
Pathetic!"
54,"Just like any other remake from these last years, this one is awful. The ending is just bad. The witch never looks as evil as the original one. Anne Hathaway acting is a joke and seems like her or the director wanted to keep her ""beauty"" for the whole film. Not to mention the racial inclusion to keep the agenda."
55,This adaptation was nothing like the original. The special effects for the witches mouths were incredibly bad as well as Anne Hathaway's accent. 10/10 would not recommend wasting your time watching!
56,Another remake made into a woke film why change the main characters skin colour the original was much better than this.
57,"Honestly, I'm not sure why they made this remake--it's horrible!This is nowhere near as good as the first. This is such a hollow, zero substance remake. In fact, it was so annoying to watch. I like Anne Hathaway but she did not do justice to this role. It's so over the top and came off more annoying than scary. Angelica Huston was so perfect in her portrayal that she didn't even need to speak and you'd get the chills from her stare. I think everything was just overly done but without any substance. Even the weaving choreography-like movements as the witches entered the grand room they were having their meeting was annoying! The other witches in this movie also seem like they were just there to fill the bodies of witches--even they didn't add any kind of color to the movie. Plus, let's not even talk about the ending...oi! I was so excited for this and even set a reminder, way ahead in advance. This is such a major disappointment."
58,"It was pretty bad , i wanted to like it but i just couldn't. I hate the fact its been so americanised in every way like its to big and flashy. The original one worked because it was eery. I feel the grandmother doesn't make sense being American in this because in the 1990 version she is Norwegian and thats how she knows about the grand high witch. I love Anne Hathaway but she isn't even nearly as intimidating as Anjelica. I wish they made the grand high witch as hideous as the original i felt she was too pretty even with fangs"
59,"The Witches 2020 is a remake of the 1990 film with Angelica Huston and is loosely based on the Roald Dahl novel. This time we have an African American boy living with his grandmother in 1960s Alabama and they travel to the Grand Hotel where we meet the grand high witch(Anne Hathaway) who is sporting a joker style mouth instead of wearing a mask in this version and she holds a meeting where every child will transform into a mouse. So will the boy and his 2 new friends save the day.
Overall its not as scary as the 1990 version as that scared the living daylight out of me. Anne Hathaway did her own version of Angelica Huston's charcther and I liked how it wasn't a copy and paste of the original.(like The Lion King which came out last year and that had NO changes).If you are looking for a creepy film watch the 1990 one instead,if you found that one too scary,go watch the 2020 one instead. I know there will be alot of people on here saying this wasn't the witches,but you can't please everyone."
60,Acting was terrible and the cgi was awful. Anne Hathaway will never be Angelica Huston. She totally ruined the role of the high witch. And her accents need to stop!!!
61,"Absolutely trash compared to the original & the book. While trying to appear woke, this is set in the 1960s American south I believe, this movie misses whatever mark it was trying to make. Felt like they were more worried about making a political statement and abandoned the focus of the magic of the story. Anne was unimpressive as Angelicas replacement. Poor casting & story changes. The original was set in the UK & Headland Hotel, there was a magic to the hotel & the darkness of the story. This movie was a flop."
62,"Seriously this movie is nothing like the 1990 classic. My family thought it would be a good idea to watch the 1990 one day and watch the other tomorrow and I just loved the 1990 version it is a classic but when we started this version.... well let's just say I was ready to gouge my eyes out. And to think that such great actors and actresses like Anne Hathaway and Octivia Spencer were in such a train wreck of a movie. My first complaint is that this movie uses an overly amount of CGI where it's to the point where it makes the Green Lantern movie look like Avatar. My second complaint is that it they didn't have the setting anywhere near England, seriously the book and original movie take place in Norway and another place I can't remember, not in Chicago. My final complaint is the acting, even though Anne Hathaway wasn't terrible it was still a little over the top with the accent and all, and Octavia Spencer's character is basically a rip-off of her character in The Help.
In conclusion, the people who made this movie should be ashamed of themselves and apologize profusely for this movie. The only good thing I can say about this movie is Chris Rock's narration which gave me a chuckle and that they put that one scene where Luke puts the potion in the soup."
63,"First just on its own with out comparing the movie to the original or the book, poor story line, the CGI is just horrible, the feel of the movie is too goofy to take it seriously. PoorNow compare it to the 1990s movie the fact that movie to this day looks better than this one will tell you enough. Missed opportunity, this could have been a sequel easily and keep the mood of the original."
64,"How to make a terrible movie:
1) Take one outstanding children's story from England with wit, spark, inventive language and joy throughout
2) Invite Guillermo del Toro - who is originally from Mexico - to turn this great book into a dud screenplay (The Hobbit anyone?)
3) Hire a director who has no clue, perhaps was never a child?
4) Pick a random cast of unknowns with a range of dodgy accents, plus a well-known female actor in a leading role
5) Add ""kid-friendly"" CGI
6) Poll some Hollywood execs for a few other must-have elements for ""comedy"" because a children's film is supposed to be ""funny""
7) Simmer in a large pot for 9 months
8) Release"
65,"Absolute rubbish from start to finish, please do not wait waste your time"
66,"The character just doesnt appeal to me as much as the original movie. Storyline is pretty much okay, but the way the movie delivers it, the original one wins... I kinda wish they kept it british instead of americanized the story since the producer said that the 2020 ver would be more true to the book instead of the 1990 version"
67,"Wow, it's so bad, that I hardly can find any more words to describe it."
68,"How could they stray from the novel so much? Grandma was not the soft, compassionate, gentle woman as depicted in the book. Targeting ""poor"" children? HOW AWFUL!! I will never show this to my children. Where is the innocence? This was an awful remake."
69,"There are so many things wrong with this film, and so I will tell you now, don't bother watching it! The first thing is there is so much CGI it is crazy. Even in the scene where a podium is damaged, you can see how fake it looks in the close up shot! They weren't even bothered to use, real broken wood which shows how lazy they were. There was no connection to the characters, everything felt very sterile. Even the head witch wan't scary (just a silly scar that randomly opened).I can see now they released this on HBO Max, as it would have crashed if opened in the cinemas."
70,This was honestly not even a movie... just a bunch of randomness! The acting was bipolar and un-appealing ! I don't recommend this film at all! It is so stupid and annoying ! Skip this and watch anything else with your kids or family !
71,"I could tell they did their best to make this movie.
And by best I mean, their looked at Roald Dahl's wikipedia for a few minutes and copied the original and added black history month sauce over it.
I could also write point by point how terrible the choices for this remake are.
I could tell you the original was much better.
Enjoy."
72,Total rubbish don't bother watching it rubbish acting rubbish CGI so far from the book that it's a joke
73,"Just as bad as Cats. Art direction color and cinematography are just not enough for a story. I was really excited about seeing this diversly casted remake and was completely disappointed. I made it to about 35 minutes into the film before I had to find another movie to watch. It's missing the flow, correct casting and magic from the original."
74,"No amount of Hollywood's jaded magic can turn this frog of a film into a prince.The charm of the original film from 30 or so years ago is largely absent. What takes its place is contrived, preachy and generally horrible.I loved the original film. Its one of the few pitched at kids I could happily watch again. This eyesore, by contrast, is best thrown into the witches cauldron and forgotten.Only upside is decent acting, especially from the lead but really that's about it.My advice keep an eye out for the original.2/10."
75,And put itself out of its misery. It would be less painful to be stuck in a painting for eternity with that bi+ch Erica than to have to watch this movie again.
76,"When it was announced that a new adaptation would be made I had high expectations, however, I just saw it and it was a disappointment. The unreal of CGI distracts you because it does not fit the image. After they turn into mice the film becomes boring and monotonous because everything else of the context is lost, even the hotel seemed dull. Without a doubt this movie has nothing redeemable, the casting promised to give us a good movie, however Anne Hathaway's performance seemed a bit fake, and the essence of the character was lost due to the terrible CGI , Octavia Spencer's performance was good but it could have developed the character more and Stanley Tucci barely appeared. With the exception of a couple of funny scenes, I did not enjoy the movie because it had no elements to catch the viewer. For kids it's probably fine."
77,"+1 star only for Anne Hathaway. Don't waste your time on this tolerant garbage, better look original 1990 version!"
78,"Though I can understand the need to take the movie in a modern and more inclusive direction, this adaptation confused me. There seemed to be no clear direction, overall it fell short compered to its 1990 predecessor."
79,"We watched this tonight with my 5 and 10 year old. We were left feeling ""unfinished"" when it ended. It was far too long of an introduction, then the story felt rushed and too short. It had such potential but some parts were WAY too scary for my 5 year old, and yet I felt other parts were too cheesy and babyish for my 10 year old. Just poor screenwriting in my opinion."
80,"I was excited when i saw that this was being remade but super disappointed.I realise the original (movie) may be too dark by todays standards for kids but they just lost all the heart, magic and intensity that draws you into the 1990 version.Overall it was just a fluffy, one dimensional, forgetable movie."
81,"There was not a lot of anticipation for this film and when it did release, it disappointed most fans. I wouldn't recommend this film. The potential was there however it never quite managed to fill in the expectations. The original 1990 film is far superior to this garbage movie."
82,Very bland and boring remake of the witches story. Wouldn't waste my time with this garbage. Any other movie would be more appropriate for kids and family to watch and enjoy together. Too bland for adults and too weird for kids. Not recommended
83,"No heart, no soul, nothing good to say about this at all really. No impressive performances to speak of. 3 stars is generous. I'd rather watch the original again than have to sit through this tripe."
84,"This is not a movie for kids, nor for grown ups. Not aure what it is to be honest.Kids deserve the truth, why they should not take candy from strangers. And parents need to soend more time with them."
85,"This movie is nothing more than an extremely bland and boring CGI filled cheap thrills ride. I can find many , many issues in this overly glossed artificial adaptation of a fun and clever story. This version doesn't make the cut for me. Overall, it seems more like a fast cash grab than a good film or barely even a film, more like a commercial, if you watch the whole movie you will know what I mean ;)"
86,"This was a very fun movie. Anne Hathaway was rubbish. Octavia Spencer was great as the grandma. The mouse CGI was better. Overall I prefer the original as angelica Huston was iconic as the lead witch. A new generation will appreciate this for sure though. Ignore the 1 star reviews. These people live too much in their mind. A great fun film that introduces people to Roald Dahl - read the books, they are better. I promise."
87,"I enjoyed this movie. Won't win awards, but still a good remake . If you read all the negative reviews they are mostly from those who think one race or color can do abetter job and question the cast. Who cares!! Watch it, smile, enjoy and go on with your lives! Don't rate a movie lower because a character is not of the race in the original or what YOU wanted. The rest reviewers who are asking why the movie was even made? Here's the truth about those nonsense reviews, MOST of them did NOT watch the movie so their reviews are biased and inappropriate. Nothing wrong with remakes and this is a great story to remake. It's a kid's movie, but we see old angry folks sitting behind a keyboard and trashing a good story.Is the movie, the best ever 10/10 Well, not really... Is it good? Yes it is! Is the movie better than the original( I watched the original 3 times)? No it is not,but it has a great flare and spins. It a nice refresh and a story you want to experience again. Not to mention the fact, millenials often don't want to see 30-year old movies and they would connect better. So if you are 50, and angry, it is YOU who is a problem. Young teens really enjoyed this one and the actors they like. It's as simple as that so take it easy!! It's a great story and I was delighted to see another angle of it. That is all. It was cool to see how the creators of the 2020 changed it.PS. Anne did a great job in the movie. She is a shining star anything she does. Chris was ok in his narration, but I am not sure he was even needed."
88,"Loved the original movie, this on the other hand is as loosely connected to the source material as you can manage to still call it ""The Witches"" 🙄 why they need to mess around with the story I don't know, it was a classic. Very disappointing."
89,"My daughter was enjoying this remake up until the ending. She kept asking me to reassure her that the kids would get turned back from being mice. I said surely they will.. yes.. definitely..This movie remake is definitely not good enough to be more than mildly entertaining for adults, so I am not sure why they would leave the ending so traumatic for kids to think the kids got stuck as mice forever, and having a shorter life. (I say that having rewatched the 1990 version recently, and still thinking the face reveal part was pretty gruesome but that it was totally kid friendly in comparison to this.)..So thanks for keeping my daughter's interest for a full movie's length time only to break her heart at the end. 0/10"
90,Not a good film... barely even considered a movie... just plain and simple eye candy here! Not really that engaging for the kids and not sophisticated enough for adults! Honestly they could've gone without this movie. Skip it!
91,I was not at all impressed by this adaptation of the witches. It was not very funny nor did it have any good acting. The effects and sets all looked cheap and artificial. Don't recommend at all! The original movie or any other kids and family movie is more recommended.
92,"I have not seen an original movie, so can't compare. But this one I can't recommend, the movie is boring, for kids and adults. Actors and their play is not impressive, I expect more from Anne Hathaway. The ending is stupid. I just wasted 90 minutes"
93,I tried I really did but could only make it to 16 minutes in the first witch we see is really bad and her voice is horrible couldn't understand what she was saying also I'm not liking the the kid who us supposed to be the young chris rock there are a few scenes that were done so poorly in the time before i turned it off that where cheesy and bad also I have seen the original but that's not why i didn't finish this I wanted 2 so i could see Ann Hathaway but with the narration Chris Rocks voice and the bad acting I can't finish this which is sad cause i wanted to like this i really did aslo one last thing why isn;t the mother sad the least bit that her daughter died it's like she doesn't care or has no soul
94,"The original was better. Too many lines and inflections that were too much like the first movie with Angelica Huston, who was more believable as the Grand High Witch."
95,"The original version is a million times better. This was unwatchable. It seems like Hollywood is intent on churning out mediocre garbage movie after movie. Anne Hathaway did okay, but just okay, her accent was funky to say the least. If you're going to attempt to tackle Roald Dahl, for heaven's sake, hire a director who can do it justice. To make matters worse, the special effects looked embarrassingly amateurish."
96,"Shameful remake. Anne Hathaway was so annoying; her voice, her look, her acting...She is and never will be on Anjelica Houston's level. This is not a kid movie. It's garbage. I don't see how anyone could find it entertaining in any way. Waste of time"
97,"Worst movie that does not fit in any genre, Pathetic Story line, Pathetic background voice who is telling the story, pathetic acting by everyone including the animated mice. Childish even for Children."
98,"'The Witches (2020)' is one good adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic novel of the same name.Robert Zemeckis' direction is very good; the casting, such as Anne Hathaway, Octavia Spencer, and more, were very talented; the story was very perfect; the setting was mesmerizing; Alan Silvestri's score was terrific; and the visual effects were pretty good.Like 'The BFG (2016)' and 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005)', 'The Witches (2020)' is a good Roald Dahl adaptation that you won't want to miss!"
99,"This should not have Roald Dahl's name on it, having so little of his story left but a basic chassis for a car wreck that ensues. Also there was nothing about the ""good guys"" going to church in Dahl's version and Chris Rock's narration is not a good fit."
100,"Had promise when you read the cast list. But no, just no. What a waste of time. Save yourself the trouble and watch the original 1990 version. It ages well, and is far superior."
101,"Seriously if ever a movie were to make a case for a 0 star rating THIS is it! What was with Anne Hathaway's accent?! First it sounds German the she is somewhere between the Swedish Chef from The Muppets and Rose Nyland's cousin from Golden Girls WTF and back to German, Romanian, who the hells knows all in one scene. Not even Octavia Spencer could save this dog of a remake. I figure Ms. Spencer lost a bet or had some kinda contractual obligation to have stuck this one out. I'm not against remaking movies but this adaptation ain't it."
102,"In 1968, a young Hero Boy is forced to go live with his grandma (Octavia Spencer) after losing his parents in a car accident. She tells him that witches are real and they hate children. As a child, she lost her friend when a witch turned her into a chicken. She gives him a white mouse. She takes him to a seaside hotel for an escape hoping that witches would not search there since black children are rarely at the luxury hotel. Unfortunately, the Grand High Witch (Anne Hathaway) has gathered her followers to present a potion to turn all children into mice.This is the second film adaptation of the Roald Dahl children's book. The 1990 adaptation stars Anjelica Huston and is a fan favorite. It's probably a fool's errand to try to do another. The only reason is to upgrade the mice with CGI and that's often a bad idea. The charm of the old animatronics is actually more timeless than CGI which ages over time. It does inject some American racial divide into the story but the movie drops that interesting take rather quickly. The one awful thing it does is to replace the greatness of Huston with a terribly weird Joker-smiling Hathaway. It is bad. There is no good reason for this movie and watching it proves that."
103,"Poor copy of the original. Even Angelica with her age could have done a better job than Anne.
I'll stay with the 1990 version"
104,This movie is just gross and uncomfortable without a hint of art or talent.
105,"For what it's worth, I found this movie to be entertaining and somewhat funny. During these depressing times with Covid-19 back on the rise in the USA, all one can do is watch movies to be entertained."
106,Octavia and Anne were incredible and it was very spooky! I really loved the little mice the most!
107,"Why do I say ""people need to be a little smarter""?.... because it is a remake by Robert Zemeckis. I LOVE Robert Zemeckis (we share a birthday and he's a great storyteller fun fact, also sharing a birthday with George Lucas). There was nothing wrong with the original, however technology gives you a little more room to play with the execution of the storytelling. None the less, a lot of the 1 star ratings were simply because the leads were black? Seriously, it was compared over 4 times to a 'what if' a historically black film was revised with an all white cast. Which is extremely demonstrative of their ignorance because that has already been done with a lot of literature and black characters. As well as people stating this is a ""political"" remake, when no one really thinks that until you factor in their own insecurities of having minorities in leading roles. Anyway, I don't love Anne Hathaway... her acting was a little much, but that may have been how the director wanted it played. No one can really recreate that Anjelica Houston portrayal but she does it in her own way which is what an actress is supposed to do. It's just a bit distracting from the story. Overall a great FAMILY film. One person did say ""it wasn't as scary as I remembered it as a kid"". Which I agree with, but you may not realize that fear as an adult. Seeing those feet, mouths and claws may be more of an impact for a child, or it may have purposefully been made kid friendlier. Because I was 4ish when the original came out and I couldn't sit through it I remember being terrified. that also may be the difference between CGI and practical effects. Still a great watch, people who rated it poorly where looking for an updated remake without it being ""updated"". It's not a transformer movie it's a Roald Dahl adaption. I and a lot of people can feel apart of the story now with a lead character portrayed by people of color."
108,"The Witches present itself as a movie that is no different from any movie we have seen before. The movie progresses with a steady pace while trying to keep the act together but fails to do so after a certain time. Throughout the entire arc, the movie tries to bind us with many scenes and shots but everything turns out to be quite predictable. Overall it's a movie filled with a lot of unusual, awkward, and cringe scenes that make it just a time pass movie. For once definitely no, watch it if you have time to waste."
109,"I just don't understand why they remade this movie, especially since they did it almost scene for scene only worse. Unlike some other comments I didn't mind the spin of swapping the main characters out for African Americans, I just don't think it added anything.It's hard pinpointing exactly what went wrong here, but the whole film just felt off, you didn't feel like you were watching actual characters...but actors acting like characters, which makes a huge difference. Octavia Spenser has done some great roles throughout the years and she just didn't seem to put much effort into this. Anne Hathaway has also done some great roles...and it seems she put TOO much effort into it. It felt like she was trying too hard the whole time. And every other character is basically forgettable, including the lead child. Who was actually pretty good I think, just underutilized because the voice over by Chris Rock basically stole all the kids thunder by explaining everything he had already done, was doing, or going to do. Let the damn kid act.Finally there was something odd with the special effects, some scenes lead me to believe they might have originally intended for this to be in 3D for a theatrical release, so you have these weird CGI sequences where they're reaching or running right at the screen and it comes off looking out of place. Which was really the case for the whole movie, just nothing seemed to work together and it results in a movie that just feels completely unneeded.As a complete side note on what could have actually worked...change up the story a little bit to have the black leads have an actual backstory as to why they're there. If they'd put a French spin on it then the African Americans could have been the descendants of Creole slaves or immigrants who'd had dealings with witches on the European continent. I think that would have been a fun twist instead of just essentially making them movie props for a diversity quota."
110,"There are some accents that shouldn't be allowed classic remakes and the top one is American.
It just ruins the film for me, ten mins in and it's turned off.
Another remake Thant shouldn't have happened."
111,"Lots of scenes, events taken out without anything new being put in. Scenes of parents- taken out. Little girl trapped in painting- taken out. Pet mice - down to one. Scenes with greedy kids loud parents-taken out. Number of witches-taken out. Affair between hotel manager & maid-taken out. Witch in kitchen drinking potion- taken out. Boy as mouse getting tail chopped off- taken out. Good 'White' witch-taken out. Pushing pram off cliff scene-taken out. Brutish men in wigs as witches replaced with more passable women. Death of Grand High Witch- taken out. Greedy kid going back to parents-taken out. Good Witch turning mice back into kids-taken out. All we got in return was a CGI cat....."
112,Waste of a good potential movie. The sets were cheap and bland looking. Felt like a Disney channel TV movie with bald women and mice. Not really much here other than the added diversity which adds different political issues to the film.
113,"Oh Dear,This should have been good, it needed to be good, sadly it just isn't. It's one of those films where a remake didn't seem to be necessary, but as someone that loved Roald Dahl as a child my interest was peaked.It's inconsistent throughout, did they perhaps rush it because of Covid? The special effects look decent in parts, and woeful in others, Anne Hathaway displays personality it's fair to say, but her accent..... If anyone remembers Rentaghost, think Miss Popov, she spans countries from Ireland to Russia, it had me chuckling.Once again, please, please try and give us something new and original, stop taking things that have already been made, and making them ten times worse. An extra point for casting the wonderful Josette Simon.It made me want to watch Anjelica Huston.I paid to download it, that money could have gone on something less awful, like a Donny Osmond cd.Naff, 3/10."
114,"Found it enjoyable both times we've seen it. It's over the top at times, but it's fun and we all loved it."
115,"Full of modern and inaccurate themes, the book was set in England and the original movie was also English made, this one is also full with modern takes and it doesnt work well for an established piece."
116,"Really they are actually, ""Demons.... "" And it just so happens the grand high witch resides in room number 666.....come on. Can we stop paying so much homage to Satan in films? This movie sucked compared to the original."
117,This whole film felt like a everybody hates Chris Halloween / Christmas special with the witches! Something about this film didn't really stick with the audience and felt too repetitive and bland. DONT RECCOMMEND AT ALL! I prefer the original film over this garbage re-make! Skip it and read the book or watch the 1990 movie !
118,I'm very sick to see they destroying so many good movies changing the actor just because of political things! Very very sad
119,"I was hoping for a good time with this movie , however what I watched was just another cheaply made CGI kids movie with poor and artificial acting. Don't recommend it! Skip it!"
120,"Some movies should not be remade and this is one of them. You can't compare to Jim Henson or the rest of the cast from the original. This remake was cringy to watch and the CGI doesn't compare to the puppetry from the original. Why did they have his mouse talk? Wtf? Anne Hathaway floating around, and having long rubber arms was just stupid. She doesn't come close to Angelica Huston and it's embarrassing to watch. The entire cast from the original is sooooo much better and now I just want to go watch the 1990 version again to wash the bad taste of this new awful remake out of my mouth. Couldn't even finish the 2020 version. Yes, it's that bad"
121,"Starts off good and I was liking the grandmother/grandson relationship, more fleshed out and it was nice to see the kid go through a grieving period- Something I thought lacked in the 1990 version.It all falls apart when they go to the hotel. Lemme just say I did not like Anne Hathaway in this role. She seemed like she was trying real hard I guess but it came off really tacky and the cgi did not do well in replacement of the practical effects. The mice were so hilarious and cute in the 90s version, and the grand high witch was perceived as something ancient, outer worldly and truely malevolent. You could tell that all the other witches feared and worshipped her.
In this, Anne Hathaway is more of rich snob if anything, and her accent is so all over the place it's hard to take seriously. I didn't understand the purpose of the big teeth either (if they don't actually use it eat children - what is point of it?) seemed like something that sounded creepy on paper but doesn't make much sense beyond that. I suppose the film is worth a shot if you like the story but it really pales in comparison to the 90s version that still holds up to this day believe it or not."
122,The story was rubbish too much cgi and most of the actors were black unlike the book and also set in America unlike the book very disappointed!
123,"I just finished watching The Witches, from Robert Zemeckis. It stays close to the book, with only a few minor changes here and there. The changes don't bother me, all that much and the cast is excellent. Especially Anne Hathaway, who is clearly having a blast as the Grand High Witch. That said I found the whole experience a bit bland and toothless. It isn't bad by any means, just a little safe, in comparison to the source material or the even the 1990 movie."
124,"This was an absolute joy from start to finish. I honestly don't get the hate. I wasn't after a rehash of the original, and this is one of the rare times when a remake makes different choices and they work. Definitely will watch this more than once!"
125,I never knew I needed a remake! It's nice to see a diverse cast and a modern twist on this movie. Wonderful job! All these comments bashing the film is very disappointing and clearly reflects their lack of appreciation for diversity. It's time we see a lot more remakes with a diverse cast with talented actors. Loved it!
126,No sure why all the negative reviews. I throughly enjoyed it. It isn't supposed to be for adults and had enough scares for the children.
127,Weird movie with bad acting and boring dialogue. The original adaptation of this story was much better and will always be better ! Don't recommend it at all!
128,"It's not terrible but neither is it great, it's just a cute little movie to watch with your kids, to be honest I was only interested because of Octavia and Anne. Hathaway does a hilarious accent and I don't mean that in a bad way, it suits the character perfectly."
129,"Not as suspenseful as the original, but a great depiction of the less than fortunate circumstances in many of Mr. Dahl's books. One still feels sense of nostalgia so its an excellent film for parents who are fans of the original to share with their children. More night or dimly lit scenes would have helped convey the fear or macabre of the villains. Though it is well composed for a family film to help alleviate the woes and difficulties that is 2020. 👍👍"
130,"This remake of the 1980's version of The Witches is well done, modern, and overall entertaining. Casting was overwhelmingly perfect, Anne Hathaway hit the spot filling Anjelica Houston's role. On the other hand, CGI was a bit rushed, could it be better? yes. Was it good for what its worth? Also, yes. 8/10! If you liked the original, you'll love this retelling."
131,"I LOVED this movie from start to finish! Absolutely don't understand why people didn't like it. It's a wonderful, whimsical movie for kids and adults alike.
It's not the 90s version and that's a good thing. It's a different version and both were excellent.
Octavia Spencer was incredibly loveable as the grandma character and I enjoyed that her character and her grandson were black - it gave a new perspective on the story.
Anne Hathaway clearly relished her role and gave a campy, intense performance. Omg those toes! Haha!
The set design and cinematography were also excellent.
I'm also glad they had the balls to commit to the events that took place - don't want to spoil the movie, but you'll understand when you watch it.
Please give this a chance and make up your own mind about this one.
A new Halloween classic!"
132,"Great show! I had no expectations and was pretty amazed by the talents of Octavia, Stanley, Anne- her performance was incredible. Hope she gets an award for her part. Marvelous movie with nice location, beautiful costumes and catchy storytelling adventure."
133,"I don't know what Robert Zemeckis was thinking, but for me, even if he didn't manage to make this movie great, he made it watchable and made it a good movie!"
134,"The only reason to see this movie is for the performance of Octavia Spencer who balances humor and warmth in a way only she can. Anne Hathaway tries her best, but it's not her fault that they cover her performance with a lot of awful CGI that has none of the charm and creepiness of the original film's practical effects. This is a movie with great ideas, but too much CGI spoils it and makes it feel way too cartoony."
135,"The film is not about people with disabilities!
It's just a movie! Artistic! Tale!
Tired already!Only because of this 10/10. No need to artificially lower the rating!"
136,"It's a funny movie for having rest. I'm 40, I live in Ukraine and I like comedies of 90-s and 2000-s. Maybe I liked The Witches because I'm not a millennial and my childhood passed without cool computer games and 3D :). Ann is a great actress. My sympathies have been given a fashionable and sophisticated witch. So I don't know why people rate this movie 1. I put 10 looking at this injustice and for Ann's acting. I remember low rates for The Hustle wich I liked, so I went to see The Witches. I propose producers make a mark ""not for millennials"", "" not for people who like movies with special effects"", ""not for...."""
137,"Personally I was expecting a terrible movie but was surprised. I like how more in-depth the relationship with gramma and grandson were and although the painting scene was missing, and the setting was different (but makes sense considering the cast!) it didn't stray too much and they added little insignificant changes to give it new life. For example how the head witch dies was a nice addition IMO. If you watch it as a stand-alone film and don't compare to OG movie or entirely to the book I think you will enjoy it, kids def will like the new version too. And I thought Hathaway did well, I didn't think of her trying to be Angelica she just did what I think is a character she is used to playing herself as well. Anyway, I really liked it"
138,"Just no. No, no, no. Why even call it Witches. Name it something else. They changed the characters of the main cast to fit into a specific narrative. It doesn't work."
139,This film is poorly put together and completely unnecessary re-make CGI none sense! Don't recommend it at all.
140,This film is just too problematic and strange ! The film has no proper direction nor any special elements to it. There are elements of racism and derogatory terms as well. Don't recommend it at all.
141,"How on earth does it make sense to, in the name of being inclusive to minorities, adapt a book written by a Norwegian-English author that revolves around the land of his heritage, and completely Americanize every aspect of it! To me this screams blind ethnocentrism. Now, I think it could be justified if there was a point, like in order to stick to the spirit of the original that may be lost otherwise. But this isn't the case.As with so many of the introduced elements to this adaptation, there is no real point at all. I won't give spoilers, but time and again, a new character or ability is introduced. You start thinking to yourself, ""I wonder how this is going to be used in the story to create new conflict, build tension, add depth, or set up a more epic confrontation."" Each time, you are let down. As soon as something new is introduced, it is promptly forgotten, and the result is that this wasted time and distraction waters down the original story. Tense, climactic moments are simplified and hurried through in the most pedestrian way possible. Both the book and the 1990 film were so much better in terms of storytelling.They also introduced plot holes so big that they confused my children on more than one occasion. I am pretty forgiving when it comes to plot holes in children's stories, but it does get to a point where it's off-putting, like, ""They're just dumb kids, it doesn't matter.""The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because of one change I came to appreciate--the addition of the snake-like mouths for the witches. It does add to the feeling that the witches are inhuman creatures which is in line with the source material.The last issue, the one that makes it really hard to give even 2 stars, is how mind-numbingly lame the dialogue is. I'm not sure this is a direct quote, ""Those mean, nasty witches, are really mean, nasty and evil!"" but it's hard to keep track because there are probably 50 or so analogues. That and characters awkwardly stating the obvious to the viewer: ""Oh no, the mean, nasty witches just ***** and now they are trying to *****!"", when we have just seen ***** and *****, and there is no reason for the character to communicate this to another character."
142,"I loved the original as a kid, watched it all the time. I even watched it before this one and I hate the remake. It was one of the worst movies I have seen in a while."
143,"Not a patch on the original film, I couldn't even make it to the end. Some films don't need to be re made and this is definitely one of them!"
144,"I love the original movie and this was not the same but it was cute and watchable. I usually don't like remakes.Anne Hathaway and Octavian Spencer are amazing actresses per their usual. Hathaway's over the top accent was in character so I don't know why people hate it soo much in the reviews. I didn't really like the Chris Rock voice over. I think a more mature characters voice would've made it more more fairytale like. Chris Rock translates to humor in my mind. The CGI is fun. While I wouldn't pay to see it in the theater it was a nice Halloween night in love for this family. It is PG, so younger children would prob be scared. Give it a chance without expecting the original , you might like it."
145,"Robert Zemeckis always teases us with something that could be family fun and charming enough for adults. He frequently doesn't deliver like he used to. Which is the case yet again with The Witches. A movie so adverse to the art of filmmaking it constantly gives up in the middle of scenes.Robert still shows signs of life with some nice looking shots and editing that has some inspiration behind it. However, more times then not he feels like he's sleep walking. He's never been a director to deliver tour de force pitcures but he usually finds a balance between fun and dramatic. The typical shmaltzy music he uses is over bearing in this and the constant visual effects do this little favors.It's like Steven Spielbergs BFG but with less effort put in, which is saying something. Even basic scenes that start promising end with a CG extravaganza that made me want to hide away and forget I saw it. One scene in particular where the witches reveal their plan is one of the most embarrassing things this year. Robert can't help but flex his visual effects in this scene and it's a sight that made me want to stop and die.The overbearing use of CG definitely doesn't help, but neither does Anne Hathaway. Who is overacting to such an extreme it's unbearable. She is the main protagonist and is so laughable you can't see her as a threat at any point. She is so so bad in this and looks even worse when she shares scenes with Octavia Spencer. Who plays the grandma to the main child and is lovely. She is typically charismatic even if she isn't trying that hard. She knows what this is.Which is a family movie at the end of the day. It seems to want to drive in the Stuart Little lane of yesteryear. But I can't see any demographic of people enjoying this. It's a clunky disaster of bad acting, poor writting, and so much post work it feels plastic. There's no heart to this. There's no warmth in a movie that tries so hard to have some. Kids will be bored and adults will be horrified."
146,"I was a bit turned off by the negative reviews, but I decided to watch this film anyway, and I have to say that I was pleased with the story, the effects, the music, and the acting. I will recommend watching this film with a clear mind, and don't try to link it with the 1990s movie. if you've seen it already. Movies express a current situation in our society, and in the 1990's the world was different from today's. So this new story has its won identity to sympathized with the world as it is today. This is for the kids and the family. You will enjoy it."
147,"I like the plot of the movie even though not happy ending I think. I don't want to reveal the ending, just watch by yourself. A movie that you can watch the ratatouille meet the pennywise. Fun to watch? of course, with the act of Mrs. Anne Hathaway that so amazing for me."
148,"The only thing missing was Angelica Huston. Her version of the Grand High Witch will never be beat. I think they could have chosen someone better than Hathaway, but we can't have it all. I loved Octavia Spencer as the grandma."
149,It's a different take on the book. Not to be compared with the original movie. My daughter enjoyed it and didn't scare her as much as the original movie so it's a thumbs up from us
150,"As someone who grew up with The original film I wondered if they would make a crappy remake. The simple answer is no, I don't think they did. The film closely follows the Original with very minor tweaks to make it unique. The design of the Witches is Fantastic, maybe not as creepy as the original Grand High witch but definitely kept some creepiness to it. The unique change of a third mouse brings more uniqueness to the story if only slightly. And The Soundtrack is great! Picked some great 60s/70s songs and The Orchestrated Music Really adds to each scene! The few turnoffs (of which there were few) for me were :The crassness of the Grandmother towards the beginning. I get it was to help the kid but she basically tells him to stop crying about something traumatic.The use of CGI for every animal. It worked don't get me wrong but even the Grand High Witches cat was CGI. I feel it wasn't necessary even if it was to set up perch scenes a cat wouldn't normally do.Beyond that the film is great for all ages. Parents warned: Your little ones may be afraid of The Grand High Witch scenes after they take the disguises off. It's nothing major, a little CGI editing to the mouth and some practical/CGI claws on her hands but might be enough to scare. Overall a great remake and very enjoyable!"
151,"If you take a classic British story you know seaside town kid down on is luck witches and then serve it with a big piece of good old American apple pie this is what you get
It's not a bad film far from it effects good acting reasonable but not English quirky and that's why it falls down,badly
It's why Spielberg wasn't aloud to make Harry Potter"
152,"I thought it was gonna be bad,based on the trailer It's actually a fun watch!"
153,"I've watched both movies. First when i was 10 and now having 40 i enjoyed almost the same. The CGI was good it lets tell the story in a fast paced way specially in the ""action"" scenes. Well i guess any child will enjoyed the same. Both are good rendition to Mr. Dahl Book."
154,"This movie was perfectly fine. All of these reviews are people whining that the original was better. That's a valid opinion and GUESS WHAT? You can still watch that version!! The existence of this, doesn't take that one away!Is this the best movie to ever exist? No.
However I've never seen the original and loved this one. Loved the book too! Stories can exist in multitudes."
155,This is a strange and weird movie ! Not very well done at all! Skip it... Much better movies to watch!
156,"I was excited about watching this and patiently waited. I love Octavia Spencer! It started out promising and then it just really went downhill. Not Anne Hathaways best. Plus I couldn't get over the voice for Daisy. It's supposed to be a girl. Kristin Chenoweth has a very distinguished voice, clearly not a child's voice. Especially against actual kids voices. I didn't realize it was almost three hours of this as I fell asleep halfway through. Tried watching it again with my kids but they lost interest. My 11 year old said it was like two different movies, you have the scary, really great makeup and affects of the witches to talking mice. Two different ends of the spectrum. I can't say it was terrible because the makeup was really good and it does have a great cast, just not good performances and the movie itself wasn't at all what I was hoping for. Disappointed needless to say."
157,Loved the movie. Simple breezy movie. The cast was terrific especially Anne Hathaway as the Grand Witch and Octavia Spencer as the grandmother.A must watch.
158,"I loved it!!! It was great to see a fresh take on this story. I'm a big fan of the first and newer ""The Witches"" movie. I also thought the cast was perfect! I had high expectations for this movie and I'm happy they were all fulfilled. I also liked the changes they made from the first movie, which if I'm not mistaken, are closer to Dhal's story."
159,This was the stupidest movie that I've ever seen. I'm really sorry for that money which the production has wasted on making this s**t! not every book or story should be formed as a movie! I didn't believe that I saw Anne Hathaway as leading actress of this disaster. SHAME!
160,"I loved this version! Absolutely fell in love with it. The graphics, the actors were perfection. The slightly different storyline, was perfectly executed with a spooky yet funny climax. Octavia spencer did a wonderful job, like she always does. I don't think they could have gone with a different witch, Anne Hathaway was exquisitely evil. Love it. I predict it will become a classic such as "" Hocus Pocus "" or "" HalloweenTown""Watch it. I highly recommend it. Get off your high horse and give it a try. Loved it."
161,"What the hell was that ending? The three kids (not two) stay as mice? They don't get to be human again? WHAT?!Ok ok. Let's try to be fair here. There is an original movie, with practical effects, a darker tone and not so good animatronics, but excellent makeup. Here... we have CGI. LOTS of CGI, and not very good at that. Chris Rock may be charrming, but sure is not a narrator. And the story goes off its rails to become more child and family friendly, when the original was more crepppy and for that, more memorable. The only thing memorable here is Anne Hathaway as the Grand High Witch, doing that funny accent.When you see that makeup and those practical effects back in 1990, you will never forget it. This one, you will forget right away.
Beyond that, is not awful, just not a very good movie. Below averege."
162,"I find a lot of these remakes get downvoted by grumpy middle aged people who are too stuck in the past to like anything that comes out now.. especially if it's a remake of a movie they loved as a child. I loved the original witches. I loved the book.. I loved the movie.. I also love this one. Sure it's different! Well what's the point in remaking something for it to be identical - yes they also use a lot of CGI.. well again, what's the point in remaking something if you aren't going to utilise the technology of today. The movie seems a lot more to the tone of the original book simply because they could use special effects to really pantomime up the original story the way it was told. Is it the original? No. But it has it's own take and I for one LOVE it. Both the new and the old have a place in my heart."
163,"Not so creepy like the 1990 Original, but with a warm feeling and also a wonderful family movie. Very cool!"
164,"Standout performances, beautiful design, and consistently entertaining, I LOVED the original and I love this one, too. Fantastic fun for all ages - though some parts would have freaked me out as a kid. Don't listen to the crotchety critics!"
165,It was ok but I do feel the whole film was a bit rushed as for Anne Hathaway as the grand high witch Well her accent was appalling at one point I thought she had started doing a Scottish accent! Put it this way she's not a patch on anjelica Huston and I was left disappointed with Anne's performance the narrative through out annoyed me too!
166,"So I'm watching and the ""grand high witch"" is doing this horrible accent and terrible acting performance then I suddey recognize her..
it comes to me it's the always untalented and unappealing Ann Hathaway. I just don't understand... how does she keep getting hired?"
167,"Yes, it's a different movie to the original, but it's still a good movie. Watch it and make your own decide for yourself :)"
168,"If you are going to remake one of the best kids movies from the 90's, you have to make it better somehow or there's no point.There was no point.Only giving 5 because the story is good."
169,"The Witches is a new version of a 90s film and as expected it wasnt nearly as good as a original was but there were some redeeming quality in it.Anne Hathaway tried her best but she simply said isnt Anjelica Houston,she doesnt have a energy or goofinies for this character and her accent was just little emberresing to listen.Story was fine but it lacked a charm and fun that a first one had and bacause of that i wasnt interested as much as i wanted.Rest of cast was fine but they werent as reletable as the ones as in a first film and also special effects and Tucci character were under used.The Witches wasnt at a level of original but it is good for a one time watch"
170,"Awful. Just awful. What in God's name were they thinking with this? The boy has the personality of a robot, the story is bland and tries too hard at the same time, and the witches look stupid. Stop remaking movies if you can't do them correctly."
171,"What an absolute waste of time, worst film I have seen this year. Don't bother even watching the preview. Its up there with the worst films ever made"
172,"I love Octavia Spencer she is a Fine talented actress But this sucked (and not because of her) The witches is a children's story about good Vs evil .this was just evil and although on the surface it seemed to keep to the original 1990 film it had no soul even with the added soul music
To be honest i am more afraid of America screen writers than i am of witches who insist on destroying classics for a buck"
173,"I'm not sure where to begin on this one, so let's wind the clocks back to 1990 and talk about the original film based on the same book. While I haven't read the Roald Dahl classic book of the same name, I enjoyed the creativity throughout the first adaptation of his work. The Witches from 1990 had many issues and stretched out a very small story to fill the run time of a feature film, which was absolutely the most notable negative of that film for me, as it was for this 2020 version as well. At a mere 105 minutes, Robert Zemeckis' The Witches felt like an eternity to sit through and missed the mark almost entirely for me.This film begins with a montage of images that showcase the fact that witches exist in this world. After the death of his parents, a young boy and his grandma flea to an expensive hotel, where they can get away from the witches, whom they believe are following them. Without knowing it, they end up going to this hotel during some form of witch conference. This in turn leads to this young boy being turned into a mouse by them, as well as another young boy at the hotel. The two of them, along with another mouse, venture around the hotel, trying to escape from these witches.The premise itself is the most intriguing part, as it's equally strange and fun. With that said, the idea was created as a book, then as a mediocre film in 1990, and now remake nearly exactly the same in every way. Because it did nothing new with the material, I have nothing but criticism honestly, aside from one major thing that I really appreciated. Without ruining it, the original film ends in a way that left me disappointed, but this remake actually had the guts to do something that I wished the original had done. For that reason, I give this film a little praise, but that's just how the film ends because the rest is absolutely the same.I admit that I was enjoying the first act of this film because Octavia Spencer made for a very enjoyable grandmother to this young boy and I would've loved more of that. Sadly, once they get to the hotel, the movie takes no chances and the witches themselves chew up the scenery, and not in a good way. Anne Hathway plays the head witch and although she's absolutely committed to the role and having a blast, I just found her performance to be way too overdone. I commend her for going all out, but it didn't work for me. This was a major issue because she has more than half of the screentime of the duration of the movie.In the end, Robert Zemeckis is a director that I love, but his latest efforts in Allied, Welcome to Marwen, and now The Witches have all been less than stellar to say the least. I thought The Walk and Flight were great films, but I haven't truly loved one of his films since Cast Away, which was 20 years ago. On top of that, Zemeckis also wrote the screenplay with both Kenya Barris and Guillermo del Toro, so I'm really not sure how all those creative brains just made a copy and paste of the original. There was so much talent behind the lens here and I'm still scratching my head as to how this was the final result. I don't believe this film is worth anyone's time, but it's now available through HBO if you wish."
174,It's very much a Guillermo del Toro film. But it was freaky as heck and I would never let my 7 year old watch this. Nightmare city. I truly do not understand how this is rated PG.
175,"I can't, for the life of me, even begin to fathom how the Dahl estate allowed this joke of an adaptation to happen. The subtlety, darkness, maturity and poignancy of Dahl's novel and its previous cinematic adaptation are completely missing here. The ending was respected (sort of) this time around; sadly it was a waste of time because the heart wrenching discussion between the boy and the grandmamma about life and death has been replaced with terrible CGI, upbeat music and Chris Rock's ear grating voice.
Anne Hathaway gave it her all, but she was horribly miscast and misdirected here. The role of the grand high witch was taken to ""Mommie Dearest"" levels of camp. What makes the witches so terrifying is the fact that they can pass off as ordinary ladies without raising any suspicions. The witches in this new adaptation give themselves away instantly. Mr. Zemeckis and the scrip writers are utterly incapable of subtlety and atmosfere, it seems.
The grand high witch's transformation is also jaw droppingly lazy. It's just a badly rendered CGI slit mouth, some claws and a dress with an animated snake. That's it. It's such a shame, really. With a more appropriate team this could have done justice to the source material. Also, why on earth was this adaptation so americanised? Are american audiences really that lazy? This adaptation is fails in every possible way and it's not, by any means, as close to Dahl's novel as Robert Zemeckis claimed it would be. This film disrespects both those who have grown up with Dahl's books and the 1990 film and the new generation of children by treating them the very same way in which Mr. Wormwood treated Matilda."
176,"Guess what everyone? Your childhood classic wasn't as great as you thought it was. The best thing about the original was the muppetry and use of prosthetics over CGI. Huston was great too. Also, the amount of men in drag in the ballroom scene is pretty great... but the story itself has plot holes for days. The grandma in both adaptations was a real G though. She stuck with her grandson and believed him through the whole thing. I think that was probably my favorite thing about both stories. I keep seeing these reviews that say ""no emotional connection"".. please. If you have no emotional connection to this kid, you didn't want to have one.The new version got rid of most of those plot holes. In particular it got rid of the painting people. If you remember the original had two different people in paintings. One was explained. The other wasn't. They also got rid of the cut off finger thing. I'm glad they stepped a little away from the ""fat kid trope"" in the new adaptation. I hated that about the original. Yes. Bruno is overweight. No the entire existence of this character doesn't need to revolve around him being overweight.The biggest change between the two is the ending. This ending left us all in shock. If you know anything about the original, you know that there was controversy about the ""good witch"" being thrown into it. That wasn't the original story. This new version plays closer to the book. Either way, enjoy it for what it is. It's a kid story that will scare kids a little and have them talking about it in 25 years as that creepy show they saw when they were kids with the bald witches who turned kids into mice."
177,OMG! The world is going crazy! This new movement of political correction is destroying all! Worst remake ever! It's an offense and a spit for Jim Henson and his 1990 fantasy masterpiece. Goodbye Hollywood !
178,"I decided to give this a go because I'm a HUGE fan of the original, I knew this would be bad but I saw the names of Robert Zemeckis, Guillermo del Toro and Alfonso Cuaròn attached to it and thought it may actually be decent....
How wrong I was.As I watched the first 10 minutes, I knew this would be bad.
I'm not going to bore everyone with attempting to act like a professional movie critic and talk about a load of technical things.The entire movie is made out of CGI. Poor character models, ridiculous looking animals, fake EVERYTHING. Literally, everything was fake. And it looked it too. I've seen better CGI in 80s and 90s movies and YouTube fan films. I mean, what's wrong with dressing people up and playing the part and actually looking real? Why computerise everything and make it look cartoony as hell.Anne Hathaway did a decent job, her accent was weird but her acting was pretty darn good and scared the hell out of my young siblings but her characters' design was ridiculously fake, silly and ultimately, flawed. Hathaway and the brilliant Octavia Spencer did a good job acting wise but it wasn't enough to save this film.The original had heart, soul and genuine magic that drew people in. The remake has none of that. I'm surprised that Zemeckis, Del Toro and Cuaròn are even involved in this. Why make this film? Why spend money to butcher and destroy the name of a wonderful Film and book?
Roald Dahl's name should be nowhere near this remake. It's an insult.PLEASE Hollywood, stop disrespecting and destroying classic movies."
179,"Great cast and decent director but what we got ????
A piece of junk with terrible acting . Abysmal writing and poor poduction value.
Save your time and watch the original is waaaay better"
180,"The new adaptation of Roald dahls the witches is bland and boring Hollywood movie. There's no ""magic"" , no excitement, nothing to set this movie apart from every other movie you may have seen or even it's 1990 predecessor. I wasn't a fan of this film at all! Don't recommend it !"
181,"The Witches is a beloved book by Roald Dahl, and transformed to screen with fantastic performances in the 90s. A distinctly European tale.This remake is a disgustingly disrespectful mess that embeds US race politics. It excludes all of the European characteristics, features some of the worst acting I've ever seen (and I've seen snakes on a plane). Anne Hathaway stands out as the worst of the worst.Seriously, how dare they turn the witches into this mess of a film. If they felt the need to remake it to cash in, remake it properly. Nothing needed to be rewritten."
182,"Let's say you somehow manage to tolerate
1) anne Hathaways cringy performance
2) her intolerable ,awful and cringy attemp at an accent
3) the narrators continuus attempts to sound funny in his narration
You'd find a remake that not only doesn't have any of the positives of the original but is lacking even in basic aspects like acting ( Hathaways worst acting btw like ever)"
183,"....by ticking the PC boxes. Why oh why are all our classics being ruined for the sake of ticking a few boxes? The original was hilarious and the kids hound it highly amusing. Unfortunately this latest remake left us looking at each with the look, you know the one, the 'was that meant to funny' look and the film just felt sort of empty. I won't spoil it by going into plots but if you've seen the original, which I advise you do, you know the plot already. Yes some of the graphics are clever but it didn't feel so immersive as the original. Another example that simplicity with good setting and humour is all kids want. Sorry, but this is just another remake for the sake of a remake. Have all writers lost the will to create something new and exciting?"
184,"Ruined a great british classic!Honestly its so upsetting, the original was TERRIFYING and i mean genuinely terrifying and there wasnt a hint of CGI!And putting loads of racism in there? What purpose does that serve?The grand high witch? Who casted this mistake? Anne hathway is an genuinely amazing actor but honestly have a word with yourselves"
185,"When The Witches 2020 was announced I was completely shocked and excited. First I was like that's interesting because whoever was gonna make it had big shoes to fill. Then Anne Hathaway was casted as ""The Grand High Witch"", was a perfect match. Couple weeks later Octavia Spencer and Stanley Tucci were added as well and I was all on board! Since COVID19 cancelled theaters to release films regularly, Warner Bros and HBOMax worked together to release it streaming on only HBOMax this October. So I actually was surprised at how much closer this is to the iconic novel. Now the original 1990 film is and always will be iconic for Angelica Hustons' performance as ""The Grand High Witch"" is unlike anything. Anne Hathaway sold that role in a different way and it worked! As well as everyone else in the cast are all really good. As a whole I loved this re-imagined version by the iconic Robert Zemeckis and produced by Guillermo del Toro they did a great job. Do not listen to the negative reviews I didn't understand. This was a great modern adaptation! Stop being negative because it's a remake. It's fun! But not recommended for young children under 10"
186,Seems to be a lot of grumpy nostalgic adults looking for a British movie. My kids loved it. So did I.
187,"I had great expectations with this movie. Especially with this cast.
The only reason why I could finish watching it is because Octavia Spencer is amazing as always.
Anne Hathaway falls short (she is ok in this movie but we all know how great she can be) and Stanley Tucci looked like he wasn't even trying.
This is supposed to be a family movie. Aimed for your kids. But the jokes and some scenes they added for the younger audience are cheap and unnecessary. More like aiming for toddlers.A lot of people is giving a lot of hate because this remake has black lead roles. Something really stupid because the fact that they used African American actors doesn't change anything. And like I said. Octavia Spencer is the best part in this movie."
188,"I really wanted to like this, even if it wasn't as good as the original. I didn't.
Octavia was adorable and the kids were, too. But Anne Hathaway annoyed me so much that I sadly used her scenes to do other things. She's over acting, *really* irritating and her accent is so bad that you can't even understand what she's saying. I was never on the anti-Anne train but her last few movies + this one has bought me a first class ticket.
If you're going to try to fill Angelica's shoes, at least try."
189,"Loved it, awesome cast, great movie.The movie is a fun movie, and brings the original movie to the modern screen with a bit of humor."
190,"Anne Hathaway did amazing as the grand high witch, she was both creepy and funny. Loved the little end credit scene. Also, Octavia Spencer is awesome in everything she does."
191,"What on earth was such a talented cast doing getting involved in such a terrible movie. The plot, the cliche ridden script and cgi were exasperating. And why does every movie that targets this audience finish with a happy dance?"
192,"Firstly, I think everyone needs to be reminded that this is not a 'remake' of The Witches (1990), but another adaptation of the book. There's a lot of grumpy middle aged people out there who don't like change, don't like that fact there are black actors in the film, and also seem to have forgotten this is meant to be a children's film. Although saying that, I do think it would be quite scary for a child under the age of 10. Overall, I think the film was enjoyable! Anne Hathaway and Octavia Spencer were great as usual."
193,"There are so many 'not thought out' things in this movie; a lot is just amateurish. The script is good for, maybe, a developing mind around 6 or 7 years old. I didn't like the narration either, a proper speaking young boy and a narration 'as if it was him when older' changes from a well spoken child to this 'older him' voice completely different than how he sounds adding useless information you would already assume, know or find out or just completely without purpose. Poor poor plot. It is more like a Halloween semi-spooky child's book of about 20 pages or so. Was not made to entertain adults at all unless you have very low expectations and are just bored enough to watch anything.
The boy had a bad script but still did well with what he had. The original blows this away and ruins this movie just in comparison.
As Snoopy says, 'BLEH'.
Also, with it being so child-like it was really inconsistent in that they emphasized Anne's breasts and made it pretty disgusting in the looks that were scary."
194,I liked octavia spencer in the movie as the grandma and Ann hathaway was creepy as the main witch with scary effects.It might not be better than the old movie but it is about as good in the creepy factor as in the original
195,"Utter garbage movie. The actors were good, loved what they did but the script, the sets, the music, the character changes and the effects were awful.If the people in this movie weren't so supremely talented this movie would be in the minuses"
196,"It's getting bad reviews since it's not a Disney movie. If it were you would be seeing 7-8-9 grades. It's a nice movie, interesting, with a good plot and no low moments. I would definitely recommend it."
197,"Nothing real in this Boring and bland film about fake and artificial witches. The movie is slow and lame, the acting is weird and bipolar. Overall, not very satisfied at all! Skip this and watch anything else !!"
198,"My kids loved it and so did I, it was funny and entertaining!"
199,Loved the new additions and storylines! Octavia Spencer does a great job playing a southern grandmother and Anne is a great witch! Its just as quirky as the original!The bad reviews are probably upset about the black leads because its actually a really cute and funny movie!
200,I don't understand why there are so many haters about this movie. It seems people have very high expectations. I enjoyed it and I think the CGI was incredible. I think young kids would think this movie is a blast.
201,No originality.. same story as the original with terrible CGI. seems like Hollywood ran out of good ideas for movies.
202,"If I hadn't been a childhood fan of the original, I'm sure I might have enjoyed this more. The effects in that film felt organic, the performances were really full, and the pacing gave the events their importance.In this film everything's happening at break-neck pace; **the characters seem to know what's going on before they should.** The special effects are beautiful, but blazing; they're unnecessarily complex and fancy, which makes me feel like it's not really real. The comedy is forced -- in fact, the performances seem just canned. I don't think it's the actors' fault. I think the lines and the editing make them awful. This isn't a broadway play, it's community theater.I hope you enjoy it, but I genuinely think you'll like the old one better."
203,"What garlic have to do with anything ??
I've never seen unmeaningful scene in a movie like this one"
204,"Bit of an odd and mediocre movie, not much to talk about. I only saw it because of articles claiming it's offensive to people with dysmorphias which turned out to ne just another nonsense of the prevalent culture of taking offense at everything. I should have known better. If anything witches should have been taking offense at their portayal in the movie"
205,This is a offensive witches movie. The witches are fake and bad . The acting is lame and lacking. Don't recommend!
206,"I really enjoyed this movie. Fun for kids to watch. Heartwarming grandma and scary witches. Great for kids. Laughs too.
Not the best version of the original but not bad either. Stop comparing the movies to the books you will never win.
Too many haters.
Actors were great in their roles."
207,The witches were definitely scary in this movie! It wasn't as bad as everyone is saying. I enjoyed it.
208,"I watched the remake thinking this film would benefit from CGI compared to the original but how wrong was I. It completely relied on the CGI and had nothing else to it. The storyline had an under current of racism, I don't know why they had to bring that into the film.
Chris Rock's voice over was extremely annoying and the Grand witch was just terrible.
You don't relate to the film like the original, in fact I don't think you really care for the characters at all with the way they have done the stupid voice over rather than let the young boy develop his own.
The only person I did like in the film was octavia but even her character was cold compared to how you would have liked her to be.
Just a terrible remake, even my kids said they prefer the original! The only thing I did like about it was the soundtrack and that was it.
Seriously save your money - I wish I hadn't wasted mine!"
209,"Yes, I am giving this film 10 stars because seeing all the complete disregard of a picture as a stand alone is disgusting on here. Of course, you can try to compare it but artists aren't in the game to please you or what you believe, they are trying to tell the best story they can. I saw a lightness about this film with equally decent computer graphics that I truly would hesitate to show to my children, if I had any. Some people on here are taking this film SO seriously, and don't even take a minute to appreciate the big names behind it. Zemeckis, Del Toro and even Curon all had a part in making this so they obviously saw the same thing I saw while watching it. An inspiring movie full of hope and wonder."
210,I'm a huge fan of the original movie and this is an awesome remake! Please look pass what you think you already know about the movie and just enjoy!
211,"This movie is stupid, lame and offensive to the disabled community. I don't recommend nor support this film at all!"
212,"This movie is awful! The acting was bad, the sets were fake and cheap looking, the whole feel of the film was rushed and stupid. Don't recommend it at all! Also, too scary for kids as well!"
213,"I am sorry but how come this is in the adventure family comedy genres? It's the most disturbing film I've seen in the recent years. I expected something fun to watch and relax and saw this?! Ann Hathaway is disgusting, her face, her head, her voice. I don't thinks this is appropriate for children. I almost always watch a movie until the end but this left me so disgusted so I couldn't."
214,"When they are in the ballroom and she starts talking I don't like how she sounds like smeagol..... On top of that the storyline.if you're going to do a remake at least take the some of the key elements,a little bit better storytelling.
I don't like how he stayed the mouse.. I don't like the fact that the main which the grand high witch played by and now I can't remember her name..she didn't even pull off that accent that well, I'm ashamed I even wasted time and all that excitement to see this movie."
215,"I love robert zemeckis as much as you do. he gave us the 3 back to the futures, and for that we are eternally grateful. But his new movie The witches, which I have just watched here in pattaya at major cineplex is likely one of his worst works.It lacks the magic and charisma of much of his previous works. I absolutely agree that this is not for kids below 14; plus being forced to watch Octavia spencer dancing is a painful experienced I had to endure, and I wasn't easy.Chris rock does a nice work as the narrator of the story and the supporting role of Tucci as the hotel manager is pretty decent, but Hathaway as the lead witch was simply horrendous.I regret I went to the cinema for this, but I still love robert zemeckis"
216,"If you want to enjoy a movie with your family, 👪 do not hesitate, ignore the bad reviews, and I am sure you will have a fantastic time, it is an enjoyable one, and you see the joy on the kids face."
217,"I didn't grow up with the book, nor did I see the 1990 film until very recently, so I have no nostalgic affinity for this story. Keep that in mind when I say this: I actually kinda dug this. Everything about Hathaway rules: the giant performance, creepy design, dramatic arrogance. Yes, the other performances are oddly lackadaisical, & Zemeckis desperately needs someone to stop him from his unending use of unconvincing CGI. Otherwise, this is a bold, old-fashioned, decidedly un-family-friendly family yarn."
218,"Guilty of Not Reading this book Yet, so I can't compare the two.
I did watch the old movie, but the two are completely different animals, both were great stories in their own way.
I almost didn't watch this because of a review I read online, but my family all wanted to, so I agreed, and I'm glad I did. It was a fantastic movie. The witch's mouths were a nice touch, and I LOVED the ending. Nothing cookie cutter about this storyline it was entirely Unique with most characters having depth and substance. There was only one character who wasn't in the first movie who seemed a little haphazardly thrown in for audience appeal, but the voice actress did the part well, and I was left wondering if she was in the book too. I'll have to find time to read it soon. Overall, it was a great story, with fun special effects and good acting. I'd recommend watching it if you get the chance."
219,"Why Anne is the grand high witch who is supposed to have an accent, is beyond me. Absolutely terrible choice. Love Anne in literally everything, EXCEPT this.
Her accent was all over the place. Within minutes of her speaking, it was apparent how terrible her accent was going to be throughout the whole movie.
Octavia was wonderful, but wont be watching again."
220,"Remaking a classic to be PC is not bad in itself, it is good to be inclusive.. However, remaking a film should at least attempt to improve.. This did not.And to add insult to injury.. It actually backfired in regards to being PC and upset people with disabilities! An issue with trying to please everyone I suppose.Anne Hathaway gave an outstanding performance, a very talented actor.. In fact all the actors in this film did well.. The CGI was even OK in parts..However.. It added nothing to the original, in fact, had less character development and seemed to go no where, also the CGI was mostly horrible.Another positive, the kids enjoyed it, but I wouldn't rush to pay to see this movie."
221,"(This is kind of long, sorry but I'm very angry)I'm not usually someone who writes movie reviews online, but I had to make an exception for this movie. Where to start? I'll hold off on the book comparison for now. The dialogue was incredibly dry and most of it was pointless. The direction, cinematography and editing were just disappointing. The vibes of the movie just weren't at all what they should've been, and attempts at being scary just came off as slightly disgusting and unecessary. The pacing of the movie was not good - at one point I thought they did a pretty good job with building up suspense, but they didn't carry out the execution of it well, and just like that, the scene became absolute garbage - to say the least, I was disappointed.
Now onto book comparisons. I was pretty disappointed with the high witch, the grandma, and the boy. I thought the high witch (though I love Anne Hathaway) had lost all of her sleek and silent charms (with her long black dress and hair, along with her ruthless and bloddchilling smile) was now portrayed to be an overly flamboyant woman, who was excesseively dramatic if I may add. The classiness of Roald Dahl's high witch was nowhere to be seen in this movie.
The movie version of the grandma was not the strong and silent woman that I had come to love when I read this book as a child. She was not a witch hunter who smoked cigars, and was constantly on the brink of death. Instead she was a woman who wore bright dresses and tried to make the boy DANCE with her after his parents had just died. I also thought they made the movie grandma too young; the book grandma looked like she would kick the bucket any minute. Octavia Spencer acted well, but I just thought the writers had completely changed the vibe of the movie by making her a fun grandma (so to say).
Some additional gripes: the movie starts off as being narrated by none other than Chris Rock, who by nature has an excited and fun voice. This immediately sets the movie up as a fun family flick, and from the very beginning the eeriness and the bone-chillingness of the book has already been lost.
The girl mouse (??????) Daisy, or should I say Mary, is already set up as a stereotypical girl character inserted just so they could have a girl character. She is seen examining her nails, checking her hair, when SHE IS A LITERAL CHILD. WHY WOULD THEY FEEL THE NEED TO MAKE A CHILD ACT LIKE THAT? Just to distinguish her from the boy mice? Oh yeah, the gender roles are strong in this one.
I dont know how to argue for this point without it sounding wrong, but in the book, the Norweigian-ness of the whole story added such a distinct flavour of smoggy, dark mystery, but the movie has nothing close to that. Roald Dahl, being Norweigian himself, has inserted parts of his life and emotions into the book, and that personal touch is missing from the movie.
Anyway to recap, here's what was bad: dialogue, directing, cinematography, atmosphere, writing, the characters and the randomly enforced gender roles in a mouse.
One could argue, ""it's just a kid's movie, stop holding everything against the book for comparison. We KNOW you love the book and think it's a classic, but jeez, leave the movie alone.""
Okay, I'll stop comparing it to the book, but even then. It's literally just a bad movie. I really don't how else to put it - this movie sucked. It was arguably one of the worst movies I've seen this year.
That's the end of my review, sorry for ranting, and thanks for reading :)"
222,"I will not be watching this garbage. i mean besides the trailer. hard pass. the 1 star reviewers have some great commentary listen to their advice and do not support trash films like this with money, it enables the producers to think that they should just keep ruining classic films over and over again. only real reason i wrote this (haven't put up a new review on here in a long time lol and i think this is only the 2nd review i've posted where i did not actually see the movie, the other was Grown Ups) is because of some interesting connection i found. so this Witches is a wannabe 'remake' of a film i grew up loving, the original which starred Anjelica Huston, a film a dearly loved at that time. Jim Henson puppet factory doing the heavy lifting on REAL special effects. CGI today doesn't count as SPECIAL EFFECTS!! you know- how they used to have to use wires and explosives and robots and claymation and all together at the same time with early computer animation, that was real* special* effects*, not this junk they pump out by the truckload for kids these days with their brainwashing. no wonder people buy this BS propaganda and vote again for Trump after all the horror and indignity we've endured as a human species for the last four years. sorry for that rant, but i feel hollywood and in particular disney propaganda is directly related to people being so dumb and emotionally unstable in the USA. ok, so the real reason i am writing is because i noted they mention this ""powerhouse actor"" Stanley Tucci in here (never really cared for him) got his start in the movie Prizzi's Honor, which also starred guess who: Anjelica Huston!!! In fact, Prizzi's Honor was nominated for 8 Academy Awards and the only one that WON was Best Supporting Actress: Anjelica Huston (her only oscar) who does not even appear at all in the extremely horrible quality film trailer on imdb for that movie lol. I was just noting Stanley Tucci standing twice in the shadow of a great actress regarding Witches and Prizzi's. Yeah Prizzi's Honor was a great movie but not because of anything Tucci did. he's a pathetic actor, powerhouse my arse, as bad as Kevin James, just turn it off."
223,"Enough with all these movies drowned in CGI! It destroyed the feeling with The Hobbit triology and now destroying these newly shot movies aswell.
The previous Witches with Anjelica Huston was far superior. The Witches was amazingly well done with amazing makeup and masks and prosthetics without all without artificial CGI in the previous one from the 90th!"
224,"Anne Hathaway is a great actress, one of my favorites but her accents where all over the place, you can barely make any sense of it
All the effects did more harm than good
The story was bland
There's hardly anything to look forward to
A good waste of my time"
225,"Was hoping for a good remake but it was pretty bland. I really quite liked Anne's Grand High Witch but she wasn't a patch on Angelica. Octavia was pants, some of her lines were completely without feeling. She seemed uninterested throughout. The setting didn't work as well as the original and the mouse transformation scenes were nowhere near as scary. Disappointing"
226,"Just watch for yourself and enjoy! This was such a great film, and a splendid adaptation!"
227,"I grew up on the original and this adaptation was so much fun for the family. Loved seeing a little black culture added to it. I watched it twice. Not sure what all the bellyaching is about from the tons of 1 star reviews, but I will tell you.... please watch and decide for yourself. Glad I did!"
228,"You can definitely tell the movie was done by Zemeckis, just by the amount of special effects (the figures in the rain on the window, etc., etc.). I didn't see anything in this movie that I haven't really seen before, though, which I was kind of disappointed in (usually Zemeckis does something new in his movies, but maybe I missed what it was).That being said, this is definitely the best movie and content to be released this month, and that's all I'm going to say, since it seems unfair to harshly judge a movie when there's nothing else to compare it to (at least not on this level -- there's tons of cheap movies coming out still, but nothing that matches the quality of this movie).Cast was great.Music/soundtrack seemed to be missing somewhat, or at least lacking, however (usually Zemeckis has a lot more high quality sound and music, like Back to the Future, and WFRR).I also feel like the movie might have benefitted from more traditional special effects, but I always feel that way about every movie.All in all, pretty good, though."
229,"Yes it is a classic being remake again & yes the storyline is predictable & the execution might be somewhat questionable. However, I find myself couldn't take my eyes off the screen & keeping watching the movie till the end.Overall, I think is entertaining & the CGI isn't as bad as what some of the critics are saying here. I have seen much worse. People just need to chill, this is afterall a KID's movie!"
230,Wonderful movie it's one of the greatest remakes I have ever seen! Anne Hathaway is amazing as the Grand High Witch and Octavia Spencer also had a wonderful role! I plan on watching this film again and again!
231,I love movies like this. I did not know it was a period piece. I do not care f it's a remake because it stands on its own. I like how it showcases the underserved.
232,I'm not sure why this movie has such low ratings. The acting is amazing. I wont post any spoilers.
233,I don't understand why it needed a remake and not a sequel. Witches 1990 is fire and it still holds up! As a black person I didn't need this movie from my childhood blackified like Annie. I want original black content not remakes sprinkled with ebony. I wanna know what white person thought this was a good idea.
234,"I had pretty high expectations, considering the fact I grew up with the original movie and the book. When I heard about the remake coming out I was excited but despite Anne Hathaway being a good actress she didn't beat Anjelica Huston. I don't understand the weird French accent that has been added because it has no value except it being over the top. The original girl in the painting story has turned into some ridiculous chicken story which makes me wonder if it is in any way related to the fact that most characters have been replaced by coloured ones as well. Theres are too many references to stereotypes, racism and the differences between rich and poor. It's a children's book turned into an oscar winning movie because it has been turned into a movie about society and racism. It's disappointing how it's nothing like the original and you can't watch anything nowadays without it pointing out every problem we have in society because that's totally what kids should be worrying about."
235,"Dont bother, terrible CGI, poorly written and they even made Anne Hathaway dreadful, original 100 x better!"
236,"The entire film seems to be CGI with bluescreen to put people on the scenes -- it looks gaudy and off putting -- and I don't like it.The acting is over the top and the music is too dramatic with most of the plot dragging on when the cast is in the hotel part of the movie.I liked the New Orleans backdrop in the first 10 minutes, but there wasn't much of it; which begs the question why rewrite the story and take it out of London in the first place. The CGI animals were average looking but not my chief complaint of this piece.In the end it was a below average experience that I would just say go and watch the original movie and skip this, but even so I rated that one as an average flick. The material potentially isn't suitable for children really.4/10 a miss in so many regards that needed a lot of work in the cinematography and desperately needed some real sets to bring it alive."
237,"My mom & I watched this movie together, and we thought it was so cute! Most people compared it to the 1990 version, but we have never seen that. Anyway, we were both entertained the whole time & never got bored. I thought the cast did a great job, as well! I would say this movie is probably directed toward a younger audience, but I am an older teen & still enjoyed it, as well as my mom. Other reviews mentioned the CGI was not the best & I agree, but it honestly did not bother me that much. This movie is worth a watch! I think the other reviewers were being a bit too harsh, or overly comparing it to the original movie. It's cute & entertaining, give it a chance! :)"
238,Poor storyline. Laughable CGI. Terrible acting. The list goes on. AND to top it off Robert Zemeckis got political on this one.Stick with the original.
239,Rubbish remake. Hollywood seems hellbent on a black narrative.
240,As the title says; kids loved the film. Of course there s no need to remake it but it's great fun regardless
241,"A movie that didn't need a remake. Hathaways accent is the only highlight but for all the wrong reasons...The dialogue sounds like it was written by a child, the CGI is terrible and they have totally lost the wit and charm of the original movie.The only reason it didn't get a 1 star was because I thought some of the subtle messaging was quite poignant.Avoid this movie and just watch Anjelica Huston - she's a much better Grand High Witch!"
242,"I tried to like the new adaptation of the Roald Dahl story, however there was no authenticity nor uniqueness nor creativity present here. The actors looked un-interested in their roles, the sets looked fake and artificial and the effects were lacking and lame. Overall, I don't recommend this version of the movie. SKIP IT!"
243,"This film seems like it was produced too quickly and sloppy. The cast all seem un-interested in their roles, the effects are poorly done and lame CGI. The costumes are pretty bland. Worst part is the film produces negative messages of both racism and also degrades physically disabled people! Not worth watching this movie! Don't recommend it!"
244,Really? the disabled community is saying this movie is offensive because a witch has claws?? COME ON STOP BEING OFFENDED ON PURPOSE PEOPLE GROW UP
245,"This movie is just garbage. To call it a remake is shameful. Its almost like they figured, why act? It won't go to the theatres so why put in any real effort. And Anne Hathaway...the character you're playing isn't scottish, nor is she any odd amalgam of Scottish and other European countries."
246,Literally don't think this movie could have gotten any worse. Bad voice overs
247,"This film is just a special Episode of ""everybody hates Chris"" show! The cast are all uninterested in their roles and bland. The sets are very tv and small scale. The effects are un-real and fake. Overall , the film was boring and barely considered a movie. Skip it."
248,"This is far from a good movie, rather just another generic CGI bland Hollywood movie. Nothing more than that. Don't recommend it at all!"
249,"This film is bland , boring and drab! I was not at all impressed with this re-telling of the classic Ronald Dahl story. The casting was bland and uninterested in their roles, the sets were cheap and unimaginative, overall did not enjoy this re-telling of the story!"
250,"This film did not bring anything new or innovative to the screen. This film felt like a special episode of ""everybody hates Chris"". There is an unnecessary narration throughout the whole film, the movie at the end feels like less of a movie and more like a weird advertisement. Anyways, I don't suggest this media , not good ! Don't waste your time !"
251,They didn't use emotions in all the movie. Just boring scenes without feeling. I would not recommend the movie.
252,Anne Hathaway was praised for her acting by critics however in my opinion it was one of the worst things she has ever done. Angelica Houstons Grand High Witch cannot be touched. The movie was hard to watch and Annes take on TGHW was mediocre. This remake needs to be forgotten as it ruins the classic 1990 film.
253,"No need to change the setting
No need to change the characters
No need to add random charactersJust follow the book!!!! It's not hard"
254,The special effects are good but if you've seen the original there's not enough here to make it worth your while. The end credits scene was far more interesting as a concept.
255,"Nobody's going to be talking about THIS in 30 year's time.
That should tell you all you need to know.
Now go watch the original."
256,"First time reviewing on here but after watching it wanted to leave a review.For a start I don't understand why they changed the settings from Britain to America. Also the characters didn't feel the same either. I don't think they even called the boy by his name Luke (although I may be mistaken) Anne as much as I love her in some other stuff doesn't hold a candle to Angelica. Angelica own'd the room. Anne didn't (although I did like the bendy arms down the vent scene, that was fun. But overall to much CGI. Even the cat. That wasn't necessary. And they're was no good witche at the end. (But I haven't read the book so that may happen there too) they didn't even have the balls to do the baby scene from the original (cowards) lol but seriously overall. Still a fun watch. I say watch it. Enjoy it for watch it is. Just don't expect well 'The Witches'"
257,Well done America for taking a British classic and turning it into a complete piece of rubbish. The Scottish/Russian accent was a joke.
258,"Besides Anne Hathaway portraing the villain, the movie was very boring and unoriginal. This movie shown so much promise with Robert on the weel and with this great cast and to fall short like this makes me sad. A good movie for kids but nothing else"
259,"This is definitely not a good movie nor even a good witches movie. This is pure cheap CGI kids and family movie with sub par acting and sets. Very Hollywood mainstream film, nothing more here than just another tacky kids movie."
260,For an All Star cast it was very disappointing. The original version was much better.
261,"I have to say, I enjoy these actors, Stanley Stucci, Anne Hathaway, Octavia Spencer, Chris Rock, and even the kid actors! The mice weren't too Fake looking, cgi overall wasn't bad, and the stories new ""re-telling"" wasn't terrible. They certainly had a budget to make this a quality theater like movie. Even though, I wouldn't pay to see it in theaters, same as the first, but, they are still worth the watch! It was nice to see a modern rendition and perspective of the story. Although the original is a classic, this was till fun!"
262,"Very fun performance by Anne Hathaway. Cool costume design. Some new magic for the witches. Good way to pass an evening with some kids in for some fun but spooky times.I would've liked it much scarier though. The mice kids really aren't in any danger much of the time. The chefs didn't even take any shots at them. The witches have genuinely scary powers and that just wasn't represented here. Without the danger element this is not really the kind of film adults also like, but just too safe and better for kids.This version has a different ending too. I don't mind the differences this movie has but I'm not sure it's really thought through. Like I was saying about the lack of danger element, the ending kind of reverses that, so the movie is a strange mix of messages about risk and change and consequences.A fun film with some daring twists that don't quite pull off in my opinion. But it's rare enough for these kinds of remakes to take risks.I'm really giving it a 6/10 but will give a 7 just because I think it's very watchable and not every remake has to surpass a previous classic film."
263,Ignore the negative reviews and watch it for yourself and with the family
264,"Why did they make an inferior movie beats me... the CGI looks horrible, the whole cast looks miss cast... why do something if your going to do a bad job at it? just look at the original guys."
265,Most of the time the original is the best. This is no different. Octavia Spencer is the best thing about this movie. If you have ever seen the original with Anjelica Houston then don't bother watching this one.
266,This one was honestly just stupid... it's like they didn't try at all when making or acting with this movie... the first one was by far the best of the two
267,"It is difficult to follow Angelica Huston but this was an excellent version. It stays truer to the book. CGI has come a long way and really helps the action of this. Emotional setup really got to me. I found myself quite involved. I saw the 1st movie less than a year ago.
Anne Hathaway really makes it her own. Pacing was spot on as well.
Wouldn't want to say I liked this version more but it did resonate with me more.
Only complaint would be, I wanted the Head Witch's final form to be more elaborate and gruesome but I still really enjoyed the teeth ;)"
268,"My daughter and I loved this movie. Loving Ronald Dahl's stories we have been looking forward to this movie's release - something to look forward to while we are all still at home during this crazy year. Shame in all the reviewers who have bashed this movie as a whole. Anne, Octavia, Kristin, Stanley... everyone did a lovely job. This is one ADAPTATION of a beloved children's story - not intended to be a dramatic cinematic masterpiece! To everyone who worked this movie, thank you for giving my daughter and I a movie to watch and enjoy together!!"
269,"When watching a movie like this, its all about the target audience. As an adult this movie was not made for me, but I still got enjoyment out of it. I like to write reviews taking two things into account: Target audience and Genre.Giving this a 1 just because its not as good as the original is really unfair, especially since most people who are rating are rating upon their own adult bias.This film is a lot of fun, the plot wasn't cliché and the acting was solid. Based loosely on Dahl's writing, it avoids a lot of the pre-generated story telling that makes the basis of most adventure films for a younger audience that Hollywood keeps squirting out in the past few decades.The Witches is interesting and gives some good lessons to children about greed, teamwork, acceptance etc. The CGI isn't perfect, and its a little over done. But it is intentional. And whilst Dahl might be turning over in his grave, it doesn't detract away from the fact that for kids, this film is lighthearted, fun and enjoyable.9/10"
270,"This new 2020 adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic has its flaws, but it skyrockets above all the lukewarm live action Disney remakes that have been produced over the past 10 years. While critics might be quick to dismiss the film in comparison to the original 1990 adaptation, it has potential to be a sleeper hit and gain a cult following for future generations.Anne Hathaway gives a GRAND performance as the Grand High Witch, with classic campy terror and vaudevillian shtick humor (minus the dodgy German accent). Although Hathaway might not instill the same terror upon younger viewers as Anjelica Houston, she none the less delivers a balanced and entertaining performance that is all her own. Let's just say that if you are a fan of Miss Hathaway, you will be content with her performance, and may never be able to watch The Princess Diaries or The Dark Knight Rises like you once did. A true testament to the raw talent that Hathaway has.Octavia Spencer plays the role of the grandmother with all the tough love and southern spunk that you would expect to find in a grandmother. Spencer might have been too young to play a grandmother, but her mild mannered yet passionate performance, radiates the film against the madness in Hathaway's performance. Clear eyed, charming, witty, and devoid of irony, Spencer nearly outshines Hathaway when they are on screen together.The highest praise of this film goes to Hollywood newcomer, Jahzir Bruno, playing the hero boy who triumphs against the forces of evil. Bruno was perfectly cast in this role, and despite his young age, is very believable and sincere in his delivery. His character is perfectly relatable, down to earth, humble, and never displays any obnoxious adolescent moments. While watching the movie, kids will identify with his fears, and adults will be moved by his bravery and loyalty to those he loves."
271,"My kids LOVE the book ... I've read it to my daughter 5 times at least ( had to put my foot down to read another ) she loved the first movie and this one is even better ... don't understand at all why the rating is so low- I hate to say it but I think it's because of the updates. This movie has some differences - what remake doesn't? The big differences are that the main boy and grandma are not white. ( hence the people who don't ""like"" this movie) ( amazing to me when white people have sooo many issues with characters not being white and can't understand at the same time why it's imperative that we do make movies that are more diverse) This is not set in Europe. It's set in 1960s America- And that's about it... except the special effects are insanely good - the grand master witch is truly scary and my kids were soo scared of her it was almost borderline for them- my son hid under his blanket at times and my daughter had to sit on my lap, for a lot of parts ( theyre 6 and 7) ... I absolutely adored this film and thought it was a wonderful remake! I thought it was better than the first.... and the kids LOVED it... they already asked to watch it tomorrow. Don't believe the bad reviews- They all have terrible taste. In many ways this movie is superior to the original and at the least , as good as. It's just slightly different than the book- the movie followed the book exactly .. this one made some changes, but they made an altogether wonderful film and the kids are going to love it! My kids are watching it right now actually for the third time since yesterday. It's that good. This is a new classic for kids and hopefully will get them all into reading the books."
272,I haven't seen the original in years. On its own I think it's a fun and cute movie. I read the book a lot as a kid and again right before starting this. Anne Hathaway was super creepy!
273,"I don't understand why nowadays many people just sitting and writing bad comments and give bad ratings to any new movie come out. I love the older version, and I love this. Was fresher and fun to watch."
274,"I grew up on the original. I absolutely adore everything about the original. The cast was great and the make up was just so memorable, along with the setting and the Norwegian background. This remake is definitely worth a watch, but you have to go into watching it knowing you are going to get an altered story. I would've enjoyed the film to be a bit more dark and eerie, as the original was. This one adds more humor and the CGI can get a bit annoying. Can we get some make up artists back in the mix? CGI still makes everything look generic and less realistic. I enjoyed Anne Hathaway surprisingly. I'm sad that we didn't get the opening with the girl stuck in the painting as that always stuck with me as a child. And the ending was different which was partially upsetting to me as well, although it was a cute new ending. Watch it. It's fun and exciting. I wouldn't mind someone else re doing the film down the road and making it more adult."
275,"Loved the original but found a new current kid movie for my kids! I believe the current political environment is the main reason why it has so many down votes. The acting was superb, writing, cgi was even good in my opinion. I honestly don't know why others are complaining about the cgi. It frightened my youngest, lol."
276,Absolutely amazing remake..... love it so much..... however if there was one thing that let it down was Chris rock voice over.... which made it more cheesy than it needs to be
277,"Absolutely ruined it. The original film wasn't great, however, was closer to the book and considering the year it was made. This new one is just pants. My children seemed to enjoy it though."
278,"Definitely NOT at all a good movie... this might even be considered a BAD WITCH movie! Don't recommend it at all! I don't like this adaptation of the witches ! Bad / weird acting, cheap sets and overall lame and boring movie ... Skip it!"
279,"Form your own opinion of this movie, but all of the 1 star ratings here are wild to me. Obviously people don't understand the purpose of stylized CGI, which is exactly what was used here. It's meant to look ""cartoonish"" - they're freaking talking mice! I thought the relocation to Alabama was fine, and didn't detract from the plot - the lore of witches can exist everywhere. I *understand* the book takes place in England (and Norway), because that's where Roald Dahl is from. Have some tolerance for an artistic change here, people! Overall I found the witches to be WAY creepier, far more villainous. The changes didn't deter from the plot for me, the ending stayed far truer to the book than the 1990 version. Anne Hathaway did justice to the Grand High Witch. That doesn't mean that Anjelica Huston isn't still absolutely iconic in the role. Was it as good? No. Was it a good adaptation that had its merit? Yes. Worth a watch. Form your own opinions and don't let the aggressive reviews here deter you."
280,"This reboot of the 1990 classic leaves fans of the original feeling somewhat disappointed. Most of the good portions were borrowed from the first film, while the new interpretations fall flat. The first witch our protagonist encounters doesn't even attempt to lure or trick the boy. She is immediately creepy, and rather annoying in the way she speaks. Octavia Spencer is fantastic. Kristin Chenoweth comes out of nowhere with no back story. Anne Hathaway, while great on screen, her character's accent makes her nearly incomprehensible throughout the movie. The special effects were nice, but there is very little magic to behold in this version. Viewers of the original will especially feel this during the ending. While they may have set up for sequels that will hopefully redeem this story, on its own, this one fails to capture the fun that Nicolas Roeg did 30 years ago."
281,"90s still the best and more realistic ,this more fake bcuz practice effects is good and technology is garbage,5stars just for Anna Hathaway"
282,Annie's performance was EVERYTHING! the movie is 7/10 but anne deserves better for this.
283,"The movie is not the best one ever made but definitely not as what some of these reviews make it seem to be! I am tired of them old boomers coming here to attack new remakes of old decrepit movies just because they can't and won't get used to change or anything new.Now concerning the movie, acting was great and the story was very entertaining yet straight forward. My only ask if would be to give it a happier ending perhaps, although the current one is great on its own."
284,It's no where as bad as this annoying so call critics are talking. Definitely worth watching. Im giving it a 10 just to show up all these negative reviews that are completely not fair.
285,The original remains supreme. Same story line which was expected. Hathaway was solid
286,"Our whole family had one of the best Friday movie nights. This whole thread seems to compare this movie with the original and then rate it low based on something someone didn't like in this remake. So a bunch of 40 something year olds projecting their midlife crisis issues on this great movie... Thankfully, I can't say anything about the original and didn't read any of the reviews here, but I also can't think of any recent kids movies that kept our whole family, kids and adults alike, as entertained as this wonderful Robert Zemeckis' film. Kids are really looking forward to a sequel!"
287,"How dare you do this for the purpose of making the witches scarier. How would kids with these disabilities feel if they saw how their conditions were portrayed in this way because of this movie? Shameful. Shameful, shameful, shameful."
288,"I haven't seen the original and I see no point to of the story is so similar, even if it happens in another place. Apart from Anne Hathaway, there is nothing interesting in the movie. In addition I didn't like the witches being so ugly and the whole story involving only a potion for mice.I can't believe Zemeckis did this.Better watch Stuart Little."
289,"I was so excited to watch this with my Daugjhter because I was such a fan of the original as a little girl, and, let's face it...Anne Hathaway and Octavia Spencer are always pure gold, but this was terrible and awful and horrible. Don't waste your time...just watch the original and be thankful that you were warned about it."
290,"Unnecessary in all ways. Too much cgi at every corner. The build is not as exciting as the original. The whole woke sauce is too obvious. Then there's the over acting to compensate it all. Nope, doesn't work."
291,I love this remake it's funny and mágic!!. No compares !!. Anne Hathaway Is amazing i wanted More from her !. The costume desing Is magnificent and desing art Is fabulous!.
292,"Very bland and boring modern CGI movie, not much new was presented here. The acting was poor and in-interesting. I don't recommend this movie at all... basically just like every other mainstream kids movie these days. Nothing new or interesting here. Watch the original witches 1990 film instead. Don't recommend this at all!"
293,"When Hero's (Jahzir Bruno) parents die in a car accent in Chicago,he is raised by Octavia Spencer, the world's greatest grandmother. Unfortunately a coven of witches led by Anne Hathaway are out to change kids into mice and curse them with the voice of Chris Rock. The main action takes place in a swanky hotel.It was a fun film. I can see kids liking it."
294,I like old one better because no Luke in this remake movie and not better than old vision. My partner like it but I didn't. Plus they did some things like but did thinks wrong in this movie. This could be Robert last movie and end of his career he finish. Don't watch just watch old one it's better. Plus they only two mouse in old one and this remake 3 mouses so
295,"I thought the movie was fun and Anne Hathaway crushed it. Was it perfect? No. Was some of the cgi cheap, yes. But overall I thought it was cute and entertaining. The original was incredible. But I thought this was a solid remake. I'd say it was worth a try and if you go in with an open mind, you might even enjoy it."
296,"The age range for watching this movie was an 11 year old, two 16 year olds and two in their 40's and we all enjoyed the movie. In fact the 11 year old enjoyed it more than then previous version and he really loves the 90's movie. I really don't understand the amount of negative reviews for this movie. Please sit back, watch this movie and not miss out on a potentially enjoyable experience for all."
297,I think the reviewers are a bit confused. The target audience are the kids. Not the 30/40 somethings that have some nostalgia for a nightmarish movie that left us with a few nightmares. Jeez that original got under my skin! For this next gen movie for the next fen kids its pretty decent. I liked it! Lol
298,The lack of consistency with the characters made it difficult to believe it. The main characters being deep south. Then the English family and then Hathaways attempt at what seemed like several differnt accents just took ya out of the moment if you ever find yourself in it with this. It's an ok effort. But too much artistic licence has been taken. 5/10
299,"I don't understand the hate here, this remake is every bit as good if not better than the original. It is a lollygagging good time from beginning to end."
300,"First thing I would like to make clear is that it is not a remake of the movie, but another adaptation of the book. In no way shape or form are they trying to be the 90s movie. That being said I really enjoyed the acting from both Spencer and Hathaway. The child actors were child actors so mileage always varies with them. Another thing to keep in mind is that this is a children's movie geared toward children so people old enough to have fond memories of the original when it came out are well outside the age range for this one. Again that being said I found it to be perfectly pleasant. I won't lie and say it was a perfect 10, but does every movie have to be a perfect 10. Can't we all just enjoy the movie without trying to hold it to some standard it was never meant to be judged by?"
301,"IIt's 10 times better tha the fist one, I love it!!! I dont know why the people rate the movies like this, Its just great this movie!!"
302,"Who isn't a fan of the three decades old original? It was going to be a hard act to follow. This terrific, warm, exciting, brilliantly acted update manages to do just that.The casting of Hathaway, Spencer, Rock and Tucci in particular is just perfect. Oscar level artists bringing their A-game to Dahl's superlative fairytale.A Christmas treat for the whole family.10/10!"
303,"So this version is different than both the book and the 1990 movie, Although it completely holds its own and is so much fun.Anne Hathaway is brilliantly over the top, and deliciously evil as the grand high witch, in my opinion she completely stole the show.
Octavia Spencer who plays the grandmother has a sassy sweetness with a strong and no nonsense disposition; The balance of her character with Anne Hathaway is is absolutely perfect.
The witches are truly and delightfully creepy in their big reveal! Super fun, don't take the other reviews too seriously, just enjoy this fun version of Roald Dahl's ""The Witches."
304,"Great movie,Me and the kids enjoyed it, well worth the watch, I do feel the witches needed to be a bit more fearful of the leader (like the first one) but still enjoyed it."
305,"I truly enjoyed this over the top movie. Both Octavia and Anne gave great performances. You could tell Anne had a lot of fun making this. I am a little disappointed with the ending, it did feel rushed but overall I enjoyed the ride."
306,Ça ne marche pas. Ce sont des successions d'images enrobées d'une narration émotionnellement vide. Nous vivons belle et bien la fin de l'histoire... Le cinéma est mort. Ce désastre en est la preuve.It's not working. They are succession of images coated with emotionally empty narrative. We live beautiful and well the end of history... The cinema is dead. This disaster is proof of that.
307,The cgi was horrible. It reminded me of a low budget film. The ending was also horrible.
308,There was absolutely no need for a remake. But the movie isn't as terrible. They took some chances with the story which I wasn't excepting and is a positive thing in a remake. The acting was pretty good. The movie is still pretty fun. However the movie has many flaws. The narration is unnecessary. The movie jumps through plot points way to fast. A lot of the scenes should have been extended like in the original. The CGI was terrible and did hurt the feel of the movie. The CGI is maybe the biggest problem with the movie. The original practical effects were far better. Bruno's character was just for fat jokes and comic relief. Which was definitely a part of the original but it wasn't the only thing about his character. Like I stated before the movie didn't need to be remade. But it definitely could have a lot worse.
309,Ignore the haters who will never be pleased by a remake the movie is fun especially for kids and adults alike
310,"Anne Hathaway brought the leading antagonist to life like none other could.. she's a modern icon.. (I believe the production team had no maliciousness in portraying the witches, however ignorantly offensive as it could be to people born different.. my heart goes out to everyone)-the acting is debatable, but the immersion of the story is undeniable. The grandma character is fun for all! The movies a fun roller coaster of a ride, literally fun for all the family. 5 thumbs up!"
311,This movies witches are not your average witches they are weird and discriminatory witches! I am not a fan of this movie at all! The acting is very poorly done and the sets and effects all look fake and lacking in authenticity. I don't recommend this movie! Skip it!
312,I've never seen such a bad remake! I'm wondering why Anne Hathaway and Octavia Spencer gave their names for this. It's basically the worst remake I've ever seen!
313,Anne Hathaway is TERRIBLE. She was the worst choice for this role. Chris Rocks voice is annoying at this point. This movie fails at every point. Katey Sagal or Anjelica Huston would have been perfect. This movie is dumpster juice!
314,"This witches remake is a bland and boring snooze fest. The cast are all not interested in their roles and the effects are artificial and lame! Overall, don't recommend this movie! Skip it!"
315,"This film is dull, dry and overall boring compared to its predecessor or most other family films. The cast were all un-interested in their roles, the effects were fake and cheesy. Worst of all, the film sends negative messages about racism and people with physical disabilities. Overall don't recommend this movie."
316,"This film has bad acting , effects and sets. The worst part is that it is also a propaganda for racism. The film tries to tie the witches as racists. However, witches are not racist. Witches are supernatural beings, but I don't believe they are racists and this film brings up this unnecessary idea into the story. DONT recommend a movie that promotes racism!!"
317,"What a joke this movie was. Everything about this movie was unimaginative and bland . I did not enjoy this film at all! Actors were in-interested in their roles, sets looked cheap and tv like . Overall don't recommend, waste of time!"
318,"I was hoping for a good time with this new adaptation of the witches, however that was not the case. This film is a bland, unimaginative and repetitive re-make with not much new to offer. Don't recommend this film at all! Skip it and watch the original 1990 version of the witches instead ! Kids thought it was boring too!"
319,Not good movie! Bad movie! Bad acting and cast! Very lame cgi special effects. Whole movie felt like a weird tv special! Would not recommend it! Doesn't seem to have a direct target audience either.
320,"This film is too bland , boring and unimaginative. The actors all seem kinda dis-interested in their roles and also the effects all seem too artificial and lacking . Don't recommend this movie . Skip it and watch the 1990 original adaptation of the witches."
321,Nothing more than another CGI bland and generic kids movie. Honestly the kids weren't very engaged with this film at all. Not sure who it's target audience would be. Not recommended! Skip it and watch the 1990 adaptation of the story or just read the book instead. This film is TOO bland and generic of a film. NOT MY WITCHES!
322,Unfortunately there's nothing very new nor interesting present here in this bland and boring CGI driven re-make. Not recommended at all! Skip this adaptation of the film the original 1990 movie is ALOT better and more fun.
323,"This film had a lot of potential, however it did not quite reach the goals I had for this Roald Dahl Story adaptation. The casting is weak and un-interesting, the sets are small and tv like, and overall the film is not very well put together at all! Don't recommend! Skip it and watch any other modern day kids and family movie."
324,This film is unfortunately too bland and boring of a re-make to cast any magic spells. It misses the mark with me. Not very fun nor engaging movie. I wouldn't recommend it at all! Skip it!
325,I mean just what happened here.You've got a classic book and a decent adaptation in the 90s and yet someone Zemeckis managed to balls up a movie that should have been easy to bring into the 21st century.Such a missed opportunity.
326,"I am sure that I am not the only one who was questioning why they would do a remake. But, this movie is not just a remake, it is another adaptation of the novel by Roald Dahl. Sure, there are differences but the differences actually work here. I don't want to read a book and see the same movie twice. With CG animation getting better, they are able to do so much more with the mice unlike the 90s movie. I love Ms. Hustons performance and I also love Anne Hathaways performance. She adds something completely different especially with a more snake theme. At first, I didn't think I would like Chris Rock narration but it works the majority of the time. I love Octavia Spencer's performance as a lovable grandma. I bet people are upset because there are more black people in this story especially because of this year of 2020 but they are just wasting hot air. This is truly a great and enjoyable movie. I recommend this movie to everyone. Its a great time."
327,"The witches in this adaptation of the classic story are too bland and mainstream for my liking. The casting is poor choice. There are some weird messages of racism and classism present in this film, not sure if it was necessary addition. Overall don't recommend this version of the film."
328,"If you are going to do something that has been done before, try to make it better or do not make it."
329,"I actually thought this film was really good. It had its flaws, but as a huge fan of the original I admit they kept pretty close to the source material. Now I admit I haven't read the book so all i have to compare it to is the first film from the 90's. I absolutely loved how scary they made the witches look, but I wish they had more spooky screen time! However, I was EXTREMELY disappointed that they changed the ending so drastically. Aside from that, and Anne Hathaway's confusing accent, it was a good watch. Just don't expect to have all your questions answered. Having literally just finished the film I have a hundred unanswered questions. Maybe they're hoping to make another? Would have given more stars if they didn't change the ending so much."
330,"Just as the original, but with some extra touches. Just enough to make it stand out of the original.
Did you see the original recent, leave this for another time to see."
331,Kids could easily be disturbed by this. The movie wasn't to good either
332,"This movie is so boring and bland, the effects are so fake and bad acting too! Skip it!"
333,"This movie is awful , everything from the acting to the special effects is bland and artificial. Don't recommend it!"
334,"This movie sucks! The acting is as awful , the effects are lame, overall bad movie!"
335,"This movie is terrible , no good very bad movie ! The whole film and story has been taken a weird and concerning tone . Don't recommend it."
336,This movie is nothing more than another bland Hollywood comedy film. So weird and bad acting .
337,This movie is awful. The acting is stupid. The effects are lame. The whole movie is bad . Don't recommend it .
338,"This is by far the worst witch movie I have seen. The cast is lame , the effects are fake and cheap. Don't recommend it!"
339,This movie is equivalent to the ultimate Karen's movie. Not witches at all! These are joker Karen looking things. Too scary for kids and too boring for adults. Lost the charm of the original! Don't recommend!
340,This movie is awful from its acting to its sets and effects. Terrible movie! Don't recommend it!
341,This movie is awful. Everything from the acting to the effects are just awful. Don't recommend this movie at all!
342,"This movie is just awful! The acting is weird and stupid, the effects are cheap and lame, the whole movie is just awful! Don't recommend it!"
343,This is not a witches movie!! This is the ultimate Karen movie + everybody hates Chris !! Terrible waste of time! Don't recommend this at all! Skip it! Read the book or watch the 1990 movie instead of this garbage!
344,This movie sucks! The acting is bipolar and all the actors look uninterested in their roles. The effects are cheap and fake looking. Bad movie!!
345,This movie sucks!! The original was far superior. This movie is too bland and boring !
346,This remake is awful and bland ! There's nothing new nor noteworthy about this CGI driven boring remake. Don't recommend it!
347,"This movie is very unnecessary and stupid remake to a classic story / movie. The acting is awful and bipolar , the sets are bland and cheap , the whole movie is just awful. Don't recommend it at all!"
348,"This movie sucks! One of the worst book to movie adaptations I have seen ! The acting is lame and stupid, the sets are small and fake looking, the effects are very cheap and artificial looking as well! Don't recommend this !!"
349,This movie is an awful excuse for a witches remake! The film is hands down awful garbage about some random Karen's running around on screen acting ridiculous. Not entertaining. Too problematic and weird movie. Don't recommend it! Skip it!
350,This movie was too underwhelming and lame ! The acting was bad and stupid. Don't recommend it! Skip it !
351,"This movie is too bland and boring and doesn't bring much new content to the screen. Don't recommend it! Bad acting, fake sets, overall very lame movie!"
352,"This movie is awful ! Terrible acting , actors don't seem engaged in their roles, the sets are cheap and fake. Overall, very over rated and not delivers ! Don't recommend!"
353,"This movie is nothing more than cheesy, flashy, Hollywood garbage movie about some bratty Karen's! Worst movie ever ! Too scary and weird for kids and too boring and bland for adults ! Don't recommend it!"
354,Anne Hathaway does not play a witch in this movie... more like a weird Karen joker character. Not scary and not very consistent with her acting. Don't recommend it! Too scary for kids and too boring for adults. Skip it!
355,This movie is equivalent to the trash and worst movies produced from Hollywood. It is painfully stupid and boring film with nothing new to offer either the story nor to its characters. Don't recommend it! Skip it!
356,"This movie is a complete mess! The acting is bipolar , the sets are cheap and fake looking, the whole film is negative. I don't recommend this film at all! Skip it!"
357,Anne Hathaway was the perfect woman for the reboot of the witches . Her humor and cgi of being a witch is brilliant.Robert zemeckis choose Anne Hathaway very good .
358,This movie is so awfully executed and poorly put together it is SCARY! There are lots of weird offensive elements spilled in this movie. It's awful and I can't stand it. Don't recommend it! Skip it!
359,They did not need to make a remake of this movie the original was a classic and this one was terrible. The special effects made it so tacky and definitely wasn't as tasteful and intense as the first one.. also terrible acting overall a waste of time to watch. Watch the original
360,This witches remake is nothing more than another average Hollywood fastly made movie with nothing unique to offer. Don't recommend it . Skip it.
361,"I absolutely loved this Remake of The Witches. Dont get me wrong i like the original. This REMAKE tho It was cute, funny & very kid oriented. The new look for the witches were amazing! The mouth, hands, & feet. I loved the way the grand high witch hands stretched into the vent, and when the lightning flew out her hands. To me Anne Hathaway brought a whole different element to the movie, ALL the actors did. I smiled thru out the whole movie. I will be watching over & over again you can believe that"
362,"This movie is awfully executed! The acting is bipolar, the sets are cheap and fake looking, the whole movie is just a mess. Don't recommend it at all! Skip it and watch anything else !"
363,"It has all these cheesy plot, script, storyline. Well almost everything about this movie is cheesy. But it is watchable and you might enjoy this watching with your whole family. But little kids audience might find the witches face quite scary to look at. Creepy.I actually quite enjoy this despite all the bad reviews. Come on! It is not that bad. I managed to watch this without any skipping or paused to finish it the next day (like i always did)."
364,"I mainly watched this movie cause I was curious about how the effects of this remake would be in comparison to the original 1990 movie, & I have to say although the movie is quite enjoyable to watch it really doesn't live up to the original. Having never really been a fan of Anne Hathaway and only seeing her in ""The Devil Wears Prada"" which believe me, I don't think I'll ever watch that movie the same way again after seeing ""The Witches"" (2020), there's just something about her character of The Grand High Witch that didn't really give me the chills as much as the original (if at all). In the original Anjelica Huston was known to frighten many that I know of, myself included, with her 4 hours of make-up I should bloody well think so and all. But here, in the 2020 remake it seems there's little to no effort at all. And like many of the reviews here, there's a lot of scenes in this movie that have been cut which were originally in the 1990 classic, as for Hathaway's accent; yes I do see the change in it throughout the movie, there's no consistency with it - is she Russian or British? I think I can safely say she's been well and truly mis-cast here, it isn't the right film for her & if you read the trivia section it mentions other possible actresses that were considered for the role & most of them would have been far better. For me, this isn't a terrible film but it's not blockbuster of the year either. Entertaining for kids yes and comedic elements are there but I will always think more of the original. Hathaway is no Huston."
365,"Robert Zemeckis with the help of Guillermo del Toro has gone for a grotesque take on Roald Dahl's The Witches.The book has been transplanted to Alabama 1968. A young boy (Jahzir Bruno) goes to live with his Grandma (Octavia Spencer) after the death of his parents in a car accident. He gets a pet mouse to cheer him up.One day in a store he is lured by a witch who offers him a bar of chocolate. However his grandma calls out for him before any damage is done.His grandmother tells him when she was a child her friend was turned into a chicken by a witch. The witches seem to target black kids as no one seems to notice when they go missing.The boy is taken to a hotel to stay by the seaside by his grandmother. Unfortunately the witches are having a convention where the Grand High Witch (Anne Hathaway) plans to turn all the children into mice.Blessed with a narration from Chris Rock, a camp performance from Anne Hathaway and expensive CGI special effects. This adaptation still struggles compared to Nicolas Roeg's version from 1990.This can be shown by the waste of Stanley Tucci's hotel manager character. At times The Witches wants to be a dark Disneyfied kids movie with a nod and a wink to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. This explains why a fat boy lured with bars of chocolate is transformed into a mouse because of his greed."
366,"Now if you're going to go into this movie expecting anything similar to the first adaptation, you'll be sorely disappointed. Yes, people seem to remember it more than the original book, but just like the case of Willy Wonka vs Charlie & the Chocolate Factory, it's a misunderstood case of not realizing what one adaptation is over the other. I can't stress enough how much this irritates me. I'm not saying this film is all that great though, as it has as many misfires as it does gems. For all the decent performances, impressive practical effects and playful cinematography, there's also a sordid first half of the narrative, bland characters and horrifying CGI. My only recommendation is to see this if you've never read the book or seen the 1990 adaptation, because it's more for first time viewers anyway."
367,"I'll admit, some stuff was very disappointing about the film. There wasn't enough action, Sci-fi and fantasy scenes. There also wasn't enough character building. everything just seemed to go through at its own pace without further explanations or more depth to the story. But this movie is not all bad as it may seem. The main, and most enjoyable part of this movie was Anne Hathaway. She played the head which perfectly. I have never seen her do a project that involved so much screaming and had that much visual effects for her. To me I think she deserves another ask her for her role. Same with Octavia Spencer. She was awesome too! This movie may not live up to its novelization in the 1990 version, but it's still an enjoyable film for the family to watch and has a somewhat awesome plot that tells the story of creepy ass witches!!"
368,Yes this film should have been british and Anne Hathaway was not the right choice for lead role but this is still a good adaption.I believe kids will love this movie and adult also so long as you dont compare to much to the classic british version.Just sit back and enjoy the kids and the grandmother who all did a great job in this movie and dont listen to the 1 star or 10 star reviews.
369,Such a great remake! Way better! We loves this movie. My kids adore this movie!!! Anne Hathaway is just perfect
370,"First, I'd never heard of the original Witches until the trailer for the remake. We watched the old one and liked it, but the old robotic mice creeped me out and I can't see my kids loving it like the movies being made today. It's not a stab at the old one, just the truth. Times have evolved in movie making and the new one proves it. The story was not in depth like the first one, at least in the witch scenes. I can excuse it because it left room for the grandma and Luke to bond and some new scenes to add to the fun aspect of being mice. Their background was a retelling and you can't be mad at it because the setting is in Georgia, not Norway so the original story of the girl in the painting wouldn't work. The new story was meant to capture kids' imagination and I think it achieved it. Anne's accent was just as hard to understand as Angelica's so I wish they would've improved on that. These two ladies shouldn't be compared because I enjoyed what they both brought to the characters. It's a retelling, not an exact copy! Each movie has their own high's and lows, which should just be enjoyed, not picked apart because grown adults think it it should only be done ONE way. The retelling was fun and meant to capture the attention of kids, which I think it did. It brought a new audience to an old forgotten movie and it's new companion. I recommend it!"
371,1960's Alabama........ really. Seems like the director was more concerned about ticking the equity and diversity box than making a good movie
372,"Why on God's green Earth did someone feel the need to place this movie in Alabama, make everyone speak Southern U.S. English and make it about race when the movie was supposed to be about witches? The original adaptation made me so scared as a kid that I had nightmares after watching it. This one was so colorful that the only thing I have right now is a color shock. Also, why was the Grand High Witch talking like Gollum from Lord of the Rings and looked like Nyssiana from Alita? If you would like your kids to see movies about rats, go watch Ratatouille instead."
373,"Ok. I haven't seen the 90's Original. I haven't read the book. I like this movie though, and I can understand the comments from the fans of the original. It is pain when someone turns your childhood memories and twists them a bit and then polishes and gives them back, only they are transformed now and you don't connect to them. This will always be the problem of remakes.But let me just be clear, Mulan was remade, I hadn't watched that original either, still I found the remake disgusting, it was a terrible movie. That is not the case with The Witches, I found it sweet, funny and thoroughly entertaining."
374,"With a hilarious blend of comedy and a few frights. Witches lived up to the high expectations. Hilarious narrations by Chris Rock keeps you smiling, and entertained. All the actors and actresses did phenomenal jobs. Fantastic movie"
375,"I will start by saying I just recently watched the original about a week ago and thought it was pretty cool, especially the effects for the time. Anjelica Huston was great in it but that's it. I love the reimagined backstory of the little boy and what happens to his parents. Love his welcoming grandmother (played by the wonderful Octavia Spencer) and as a black man I relate to this story a lot more than the original. The music used was perfectly used as well as Chris Rock's narration. I thought Anne Hathaway did a great job and the effects were pretty decent. I know people love the original of anything no matter what and usually hate remakes, but simply put this one was a lot better simply because the boy and grandmother are black, it makes it more personal and relatable to me."
376,"I love the original movie and although the remake is not as good, I feel that it is still a good movie. I watched it with my 5 year old and we were able to finish it and she liked it. It is a kids movie, a little bit more darker or scarier my girl would not have watch it."
377,"If you like a movie that is all about fun, a decent storyline, great special effects and loaded with really good actors this is it.Perfect Hallowe'een movie for the whole family. Watch and enjoy!"
378,"I went into this with very low expectations, having read the book as a child and seen the original movie. If I'm going to be completely honest, anyone who hasn't seen this film needs to go in without seeing reviews because there is a clear bias against it. It is a very decent if not very straightforward remake that perhaps simplifies Roald Dahl's story a bit to be a bit cleaner cut whilst keeping it fresh and modern. Just enough backstory is given to keep children aware and adults interested. The movie has beautiful visuals and the acting is actually very good with special mentions going to both Octavia Spencer and Anne Hathaway's performances.The latter I tried to dislike but her habit of chewing the scenery and penchant for over the top villainy make her a perfect villain although at times, her attempt at an Eastern European accent can be a bit jarring. The child actors, Jahzir Kareem Bruno and Codie-Lei Eastick, we see in the lead roles are both very good in their limited screen time and their voice overs are professional. As an African-American male, I personally enjoyed the subtle references which came off as relatable but not too forced as to make it exploitative especially in a children's film. I loved how the film added in the aspects of the witches preying on those who wouldn't be missed or were vulnerable. All in all, this is a wonderful film and I feel any fan of the original and the book will love this straightforward but very good remake."
379,"Where do I start? Right away I could tell you I was in for quite the halloween treat. The aesthetic, the costumes, the sets, were very much needed to be enhanced from the original and zemeckis and co. absolutely delivered.Octavia is fantastic in this one folks, but isn't she just the charming little peach in just about everything she's in, there honey child?The child is no longer cringey and isn't given terrible lines and direction which is a big relief. Remember when the child in the original kept saying ""Grandma!"" in a far too excited and annoying cadence? I do and I still have nightmares.Opening up the film, it's again, so much better. You actually feel for the child losing his parents in this one as it isn't as cold or glossed over like in the 1990 version.Anne Hathaway is just phenomenal as the grand high witch, and I was scared too, as Houston was just superb in the original. She had no problem with portraying a hilarious and genuinely terrifying witch in this.I'll try not to go too far into this one, but there are some much welcomed surprises and twists in this that will delight and entertain the entire family.Go see it."
380,"You're not a child anymore, and they aren't here for you. i'm sure if you show any child they'll be totally engrossed in this movie and characters.also how are you going to say this is a shot by shot remake? i suspect a lot of you didn't even watch this. the original is a better movie overall, but saying this is a one star movie is a mistake.if you're not a picky, nostalgia ridden human, you'll likely find enjoyment from this. fast paced, easy to watch, kinda creepy, pretty funny, and perfect introduction to horror for young kids. i recommend."
381,Terrible casting and mangling a beloved story. Not much more needs to be said other than go watch the 1990 version.
382,Its strays so far from the original its unbelievable. The cast is totally wrong for the movie especially considering the grandma an grandson are white austrian and english in the original. And all of a sudden bame from alabama????? Totally awful movie.
383,"Roald Dahl's 1983 novel 'The Witches' was one of many hits from the highly-acclaimed author's prestigious bibliography and was brought to life on the big-screen in 1990 thanks in large part to producer Jim Henson. Dahl, however, was rather critical towards the film (as he was admittedly known to do when it came to adaptations of his work) for its radically different ending. Nevertheless, the film was a huge success with critics and while it may not have been much of a box-office hit, it has very much become a cult classic of its time. As such, it's not too surprising that the 1990 film's legacy has had a major impact on the reactions towards this year's new adaptation of the novel, directed by Robert Zemeckis and produced by Guillermo Del Toro and Alfonso Cuaron. But while most of the user reviews on this site are venomously decrying this as a complete and utter disaster, it's not 'that' bad.To be fair, though, I'm not saying that it's perfect as it's arguably the most by-the-numbers film that Zemeckis has ever directed. Just like what happened when Tim Burton directed his remake of 'Planet of the Apes' in 2001, this is one of those films where, if you didn't know that it was directed by the same guy behind 'Back to the Future' and 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit', you probably wouldn't have guessed since it's one of those films that could've easily been done by anyone. Still, for what it's worth, the film does a nice job of maintaining the whimsical nature of Roald Dahl's writing where the kids are the heroes in a story that's full of the delightfully twisted dark sense of humor that Dahl was well-known for. And while it's completely understandable if some may find her performance to be a bit too over-the-top, Anne Hathaway is clearly having a lot of fun in the lead role of the story's main antagonist, the Grand High Witch.Now as a quick disclaimer, while I have read the book, I'll admit that I've never watched the 1990 film because, simply put, it never ended up on my radar when I was growing up. As such, I don't have the strong connection to it that other folks have, thus influencing their thoughts on this new film. And becuase of this, I found this new version of 'The Witches' to be generally solid overall. While it's far from being the best film that Robert Zemeckis has ever directed, it's ultimately a harmless family-friendly flick that helps bring one of Dahl's most famous stories to a new generation."
384,"Casting, acting, pacing, all wrong. Another ruined movie. Chris Rock is terrible.The only reason it got 2 stars was that it had some good songs."
385,"Things are a little different but don't let they deter you from watching it. It has a fun story and all the actors/actresses do a great job! I had a great time watching it! Funny, spooky facial expressions from witches and a great story! Should definitely watch!"
386,"This is how you take a story and just destroy any heart it has.Whilst the cast isn't awful, they aren't given much to work with.A lot of people see the 1990 movie as a classic, and this 2020 version is definitely not a classic. It's full of over the top CGI, bad dialogue and too much Anne Hathaway cleavage for a 'family' movie.Some of the spooks are still there but then the tension is ruined by everything else that is bad.Let's not talk about that unnecessary voiceover.This is 2020s CATS. But with mice instead."
387,"I wish if they remade classics that they did a better job. I could've done WITHOUT Chris Rock's annoying voice and Anne Hathaway's TERRIBLE performace. I honestly do NOT why they casted her for this. Because of those two I am sad to say I am giving this film three stars. If it wasn't for them, I would have given the film at LEAST a six. That's how bad their perfomace was."
388,"This is a movie that's bizarre and not in a good way. The Witches look pretty horrifying and not in a spooky manner. The animation as a whole is very poor for the year 2020 and is distracting throughout. The fact 3 Oscar-winning directors were heavily involved in the making of this film is stunning. The effort here is lackluster, except for Hathaway, who you can tell is enjoying chewing the scenery. Zemeckis keeps doing these weird hybrid animation movies that just aren't good. A lot of the visuals are disturbing and the messages aren't well told. Also the Everybody Hates Chris narration is super weird. Not sure who asked for this movie, but it wasn't me."
389,Firstly there are a suspiciously large amount of 1 star reviews. Conclusion: trolls. Or just bored people with too much time on their hands. My kids absolutely LOVED this
390,"My 4 year old has a very poor attention span. Hardly ever sits through movies but she sat through the whole of this and thoroughly enjoyed it. She laughed throughout and found the grand high witch very scary.I personally found the movie to be watchable and it wasn't bad at all, the effects were very good and I liked Anne Hathaway's performance. I did however feel the movie lacked the depth of the original. They changed a lot of the original storyline which made it hard to connect with the characters and not to mention they didn't include a certain character that I feel was central to the original in adding a nice twist to the story, mainly at the end (if you've seen it and then watch this you will know who I'm talking about). I didn't feel any macabre and eerie aspects to this film and missed the story about the girl in the picture from the original movie. I hated the ending.I found that there were too many comedic elements to the movie instead of good character development and I would have given it 5 stars for effort, however my daughter just loved it and at the end of the day these kind of movies are more tailored to children so, although far from perfect, it's certainly one that little ones will enjoy around Halloween. Angelica Houston will always be the grand high witch to me but maybe watch this with an open mind with the kiddies and try not to take it too seriously. It's not a bad movie."
391,"I was really looking forward to catching this because the 1990 version with Angelica Huston as the villainous Grand High Witch was my absolute favourite film as a child.There are some things about this version which are enjoyable. I liked the opening section, and Octavia Spencer puts in a great performance as a characterful, strong and kind grandmother.It's the entire middle stretch of the film, taking place at the hotel, which is lacking. Hathaway's Grand High Witch just isn't scary. She's too clownish, over the top and silly. There is no subtlety. No sense of controlled, calculating evil under a sophisticated, disguised surface. The worst section was the conference room scene. In the original, it was suspenseful and scary. There's no suspence in this new version, it moves very quickly, and the over the top CGI is very off-putting. The reveal of the witches true appearance happens within seconds. Bruno's arrival and transformation is similarly rushed, there's no build-up as he slowly realises he's walked into danger and that he's the of a joke but doesn't know what it is yet.I'm sure children may enjoy this version, and maybe that's all I that matters, but I think the 1990 version is far superior in its writing, performances and effects."
392,Not near as good as the original but I suppose cute in it's own way.
393,First of all don't know why all this negativity here. Maybe it's not the remake audience expected. Still if you are watching it for first time with your family it is one of the sweetest enjoyable family movies I have seen. Perfect movie to watch with family this Halloween. Don't miss it.
394,I remember how scared I was watching this movie as a kid. Haha! This remake lived up to the original. My daughter was so entertained that she didn't want to blink. She's only 2 so I needed to remind her it wasn't real but she loved it!
395,"Not bad. The movie felt flat and rushed at times, but i recall this being an issue with the 90's movie aswell."
396,"I've just seen This movie enough quite enjoyed it
I did not do what everyone else is doing and Compared it to the original 1990s film the witches..
What is good about this from its abit Different to the original and was fun to Watch everone that is Giving the movie of 1 out of 10 is just Comparing itto The original film. So If you are going to put this new Version of the witches on. Don't not compare it to the original and you Real enjoy it and for people saying It's not scary remember you was a kid back in the 1990 so this new one well not be as Scary for you now ... enjoy the film people"
397,"I watched the first as a child and I loved it, watching this version as an adult was just as good and even better in some parts. I was not disappointed nor did I feel it was a waste of my time watching. It was a refreshing remake of an old classic with some very good actors."
398,Nice family movie with great actors! Don't believe all the negative reviews.
399,Octavia Spenser carries a whole lot of film... not sure what anyone else was doing there besides collecting a pay check.
400,"It's pretty sad to see a bunch of adults getting so bent out of shape at a film aimed at children. I have seen so many comments on horror groups from outraged men and women who think 'true horror fans' will hate this movie. They need to grow up.
We know that the original was great, get over it. Kids will love this, they'll also love the original. Shut up and let people enjoy things.Ok so onto the movie.
The story has moved to 1960s Alabama. Little Hero loses his parents in a car crash, and his Grandma comes to take him into her home. Not ashamed to say that the first 15 minutes really moved me, actually had a lump in my throat. Grandma singing ""Reach Out, I'll Be There"" to a clearly traumatised little boy is genuinely upsetting.
The story hasn't changed much. The Witches are holding their annual meeting at a posh hotel (where Hero and Grandma are hiding after they encounter a witch near their home) under the guise of a conference for a child protection group.
The action is very slapstick, the mice are very cute, the acting is great and the story is pretty heartwarming.
I was slightly put off by the fact that Anne Hathaway was playing the Grand High Witch because I've never been a fan, but she was great - although her accent jumps around quite a bit.
Octavia Spencer is one of my favourite actresses, so there was no question of me not watching this movie. She is excellent in it, just the right mixture of stern Grandma and loving Grandma.
The children are excellent too.Your kids will love it, the whining adults who need to grow up and let people make up their own minds need to stop living in the past. This movie does not erase the original. If you don't like how it looks just don't watch it.
Not rocket science is it?"
401,"I didn't expect too much so I wouldn't be disappointed, in the end it was an enjoyable watch.I loved the original film and was quite sad that it didn't have the same ending, but I imagine this was done to allow for a sequel.Either way, Anne did a good job and there were some funny moments.My son loved it, it'll be the Witches film of his generation and I'm ok with that.It was a fun watch with some giggles along the way.6/10"
402,"Nothing original except different cast, and really unnecessary cgi! They forgot how to do movie without cgi. Ridiculous.The original is 10x better"
403,Superb special effects. Please redub it with Anne Hathaway speaking in her normal voice 😖
404,"I read some reviews & wow, some of y'all need a hobby/life. It's not that deep. It's a fun movie, that me & my KIDS enjoyed. WTF are y'all looking for. I liked the original too, but damn. Disregard the overly negative reviews & watch for yourself...I'm glad I did."
405,"Roald Dahl would be FURIOUS about Hollywood destroying his work. He is Norwegian. The Witches was based on the Vardo Witches of Norway. In the book Grandma is Norwegian to tie the old superstitious tale together. The boy in the story is supposed to be British. The location should be the United Kingdom. Anne Hathaway was disastrous casting choice, she also had an unbearable multi 'European' accent (if you can call it that!). Chris Rock's narration is over the top and grating. Not everything needs to be Americanised to sell. I can't believe the line ""only rich white people can afford to come to this hotel"" was actually approved in a kids film - fuelling the fire for the next generation. Zemeckis should be ashamed of himself, he has also ruined a beautiful story. I'm absolutely disgusted!"
406,"Despite the sour responses I read here... it is a great fun movie, go see for yourself!!!"
407,"If you are here to study film this movie isn't for you... all of the 1 star reviews are apparently from movie makers of the highest caliber.I LOVED the original and wanted to see this version. I was thoroughly entertained the whole way through, even the soundtrack was great! I did notice some reviews saying the movie was too scary for children... I would imagine these reviewers never read the actual book.It also seems people have forgotten how Angelica Huston's accent differed through the whole original movie... but I still loved it. Have a cocktail and some snacks and watch this movie and have fun!"
408,"This movie is just awful. The casts acting is poor , the sets all look too artificial and tv like, and the effects are just lame and bland. This film feels like it belongs in a different era. The kids thought it was too scary and I thought it was boring and generic. Don't recommend it!"
409,This movie is too scary for kids and not engaging enough for adults! Don't recommend it!
410,"The original film was great, I really do not understand the need to remake it other then for the reason of virtue signalling. Don't waste your time."
411,This movie is awful and boring too at times. The acting in this movie is too artificial and bland. The sets are too small and tv like. Extremely un-cinematic and predictable kids movie! Don't recommend it!
412,The whole movie is lame and poorly executed! Don't recommend it!
413,"The witches have conjured up a mess of a movie! The acting is a bit bipolar, the sets are cheap and small, the effects are fake looking and bland. Overall, not very impressed at all with this film. The kids thought was too scary and I thought was too boring ! Don't recommend it!"
414,"Ooooh i liked it! Finally we can go to the cinema again after it was closed due to government regulations.
It's cute, funny and exciting. Octavia Spencer and Anne Hathaway are awesome in this movie. Anne is hilarious as witch!For a while no things on your mind like covid-19, trump:/ and other negativity. Just enjoying this movie :D"
415,"I really loved this movie. This production quality, hotel, visual effects were all great. There was lot of humour too, and Anne Hathaway's accent is really funny. This is the same thing which people did with MULAN giving bad reviews. Trust me, they are all wrong. Mulan and The Witches are both great movies. Doesn't deserve the 5.4 rating"
416,"Honestly, I really liked this film. I watched them back to back and here's what I think. The original scared me when I was a child. I really liked the original look of the original GHW because it made her stand out from all the others. The original was creepy, but it also had better make up for the witches. I like how they didn't make the shoe and wig removal in the old movie so dramatic. I take off my shoes everyday, but I don't sigh in relief acting as if my parents didn't discover I hid a stash of Halloween candy under my bed. The original I felt could've touched up on some things and toned down on others. For example, we didn't really need the chase scene in the original. I like how they made it more direct and straight to the point in the new one. One thing I've noticed is people complaining about Anne Hathaway's accent. I actually loved her accent. I like how it was Russian and Scottish and Swedish all at once. I also like how it had more of a backstory in the new one. By that I mean how the grandma was a voodoo priestess and knew all about witches. I like how they made the new one with less adult aspects like the manager hitting on the chambermaid. Octavia Spencer was kinda perfect for the role of the grandma. I like how they used more humorous scenes. I think they could've put a little more thought into the transformation in the original, but overall both movies were good. Would recommend, no matter what the other reviews say."
417,"This film is nice fairytale for children. Firstly, the plot, that was based on Roald Dahl, is very interesting,, it shows how love and family can beat the evil. Secondly, the cast is great, but for me Ann Hathaway takes all viewer's attention. Thirdly, visual effects and soundtrack by Alan Silvestri are awesome too.
So, it's good family film."
418,"Ooooookaaaaaaay, before I get into this and believe me, I'm going to get into it, let me set the scene. I love Roald Dahl, I love The Witches, I'm currently reading it to my class at the end of the day (my Grand High Witch would fit right at home as Herr Flick's eviller other half from Allo Allo) and I love the 1990 film. Now normally I'd be a bit wary of Roald Dahl remakes, but after watching the trailer, the change on location and era seemed to work and the cast of Anne Hathaway, Octavia Spencer and Stanley Tucci is incredibly strong, so we thought why no give it go.And it just goes to show, that you should stick to your instincts and the people who make trailers are veil geniuses.Adventure - I'll give you that, Comedy - not so much, Family - are you kidding me?The story changes from London to 1960s Alabama, from a Norwegian Grandma to a Deep South one, with a history from the turn of the century with Witches and in fact these changes fit in with the story and style of a Roald Dahl book, it maintains the creepiness of The Witches by giving them a believable backstory.However, when Hero Boy and Grandma(they're not given names in this film - which is a bit odd) check into a nearby hotel - again a diversion from the original for the reason, things go a bit, well rubbish really. For me it loses its Roald Dahl quality, its scariness mixed with fantasy and humour. It just goes a bit horrible really.
The Witches, who by rights, have no toes, are bald with itchy heads, huge nostrils and claws amongst others are turned into demons from your nightmares. I totally agree with those who got offended by their hands, which should be claws but not look like really long three-fingered things and I use the words things, even though I hate using that word in writing, they don't look like claws, they look like someone has had a bad accident. If I was someone who had Ectrodactyly, a limb abnormality, I'd look at it and think they were taking the mick!On top of that, the Witches mouths open up like something out of a nightmare I had after watching several Vampire series in one night, it's something out of V Wars or Van Helsing, not a family film. You've got it very wrong there Mr Zemeckis.And, my final point - to be fair I'm holding back as there is so much more, I could go on about, is the inclusion of the wonderful Kristen Chenoweth as the voice of a child who has been turned into a mouse, WHY? All other children whether real or mouse like are played by and voiced by children, why do they need the voice of a woman. It is just odd and takes away from the character, a character who by the way doesn't exist in the book.You can see the influence of Mr Zemeckis and Guillermo del Toro and if it wasn't changing such a huge part of not only my childhood but also my adulthood as a teacher then I might, nah who am I kidding, I'm regretting renting this, I could've spent my money on something I'd have enjoyed more instead - like dental surgery!I'm not going to score this as I don't think it would be fair to the very talented people involved and to be honest, I reckon children would probably really enjoy it, but adults if you've grown up with the original - swerve this please!"
419,Minus eight stars for Anne Hathaways accent.I like the song they used in the movie (Four Tops - Reach Out I'll be there (1967)) though.
420,"The film was so unwatchably bad that I just could not watch it until the end. It deserves a single four lettered review!
The special effects were very good indeed and it is that that earns the 1 star rating.
I would have to swear to truly indicate how bad this dross is so I will end the review here."
421,"I just saw this tonight, and it's truly...something. The script was fine, the cast was great, and the plot was easy to understand. But...the imagery-they really got out of hand. I get it's supposed to be dark, but the creepy imagery went a little too far over the deep end. I usually like dark movies (for example: Edward Scissorhands, Into the Woods, Corpse Bride), but I don't like when it gets TOO dark. I liked the human forms of the witches WAY better than their true demon forms.So...4/10."
422,"I'm all for a new take on something, but when you've managed to get tons of charities for disabled people upset because of a characteristic that the director decided to do differently from the book's depictions then you know you're off to a bad start.The fact that it was switched to Alabama US instead of the UK seems an odd move, but then to change Grandmama from being Norwegian also removes some of the mystic charm of the Nordic angle of the story and (in my mind) betrays Dahl's heritage and experiences, too.The final straw was race coming into it and remarks from the new (black) grandma that ""witches only prey on the poor and wouldn't bother rich white people"". We then almost immediately see them at the exact hotel she chooses to go to in order to avoid witches because 'it's full of rich white people' and the first child the Witches turn into a mouse is a rich white child!It's scary and confusing for children and completely naff for adults. It's lost all the charm of the book, has ostracized people with disabilities and decided to bring class and race into the picture without any context and then in schizophrenic fashion turns that on its head anyway!I can't find anything redeeming about it. Even the CGI was naff. Anne Hathaway does the best she can, but even that's not enough. Avoid."
423,"This film is about an orphan who moved to live with his grandmother, who had some relation with the witches. They both had to save the world from the Witch. CG is good but not great. The witch in this film is designed in a unique way, unlike the common witch in the other films. She is very scary, funny, ugly and weird. The story became excited since the witch appeared until the middle of the film, which the protagonist and her friends had to fight against the witch and her pensioners. The fight scene is so fun. I think the film is too short. There is a scene that the protagonist were cursed into rats. Whoever like Toy Story or Ratatouille may like this film too. The Witches is not the film for little kids because there are some violence and adult jokes."
424,"This is by far the worst witches movie I have ever seen! The whole movie is barely a movie... more of a weird commercial. I didn't enjoy it at all! The acting was bad , the sets were fake and cheap. Overall, SKIP IT!"
425,"Its far to little to say the acting is bad its the worts i have seen since movie glen or glenda, low budget movies have better actors and anna this is her worst movie ever..."
426,"At the beginning we are told, chris rock as the narrator..... God give me strength... totally off putting voice, I don't mind changing the color of the main actor, not a problem, felt the grandma looked too young, liked tuccis portrayal, anne hathaway.... just did not do it for me. the kid was fine. it is an okay movie if you have never seen the original, but compare it to the original and it is awful. sometimes having a lower budget can cause more creativity and better results, crazy to think the guy who wrote and directed back to the future did this, success comes in phases and his phase has clearly gone. to not ruin a classic, just show your kids the original. the first witch that meets the boy in the store compared to the one that meets the by in the original outside his house.... terrible. levels to this and felt this was made to appease the internet philosophy of how you should think and what and who you should be. terrible casting and terrible directing. really did not enjoy it."
427,"The witches in this 2020 adaptation of the Ronald Dahl story are designed poorly and negatively reflect on the physically disabled community. I don't recommend this movie! The acting is poor, the sets are small and cheap looking and the overall film is not much of a movie ! Skip it!"
428,This film was almost too much fun and corney kids cgi movie with lack of creativity. There is too much political nonsense tied to this film and apparently offensive ideas about physically disabled people . I don't recommend this film!
429,"Quite disappointing to be honest. The main storyline was over so quickly - I thought there was going to be an amazing new extended ending but nope - that was actually the climax of the movie - a terrible climax at that. To be longer than the original but not have any decent material to justify the longer runtime was crazy. I just didn't understand the pacing of this film and how a team of film makers with an A-list cast thought this was an acceptable remake or even a good standalone film . Anne Hathaway was creepy-ish I guess, but would've been better without the stupid extending arms. Overall her transformation was underwhelming. The lack of other witches speaking, acting and the exclusion of the good witch/ assistant witch that rights the wrongs in the end was a massive hole that needed feeling . To sum up the whole movie - it was very underwhelming."
430,"I'm a fan of some of his films so this was a disappointment. I formed an opinion of 'why bother'. Casting was weak - even Olivia Spencer was trapped in a shallow humorless role. The tone of this film felt mean without the subtle humor of the original. Hathaway, whose work I enjoy, unfortunately is no Anjelica Huston who did manage to elevate a menacing caricature to high drag drama.
Why bother? I want to watch the original again"
431,"A new adaptation of Dahl's The Witches has hit HBO Max and it's a bit of mixed bag. While some of the effects are charmingly whimsical, the tone is often too silly to conjure up any legitimate threat.In the 60's, a little boy is orphaned after a deadly car crash and is sent to live with his eccentric grandmother in Alabama. Almost immediately, he finds himself preyed upon by evil witches who look almost exactly like regular women except for their strange hands, feet, the scar across their mouth, and the fact that they're always wearing wigs or turbans to cover up their baldness.He and his grandmother escape to a swanky coastal hotel only to discover it's crawling with witches who are in town for their annual meeting. When the little boy gets too close, they turn him into a mouse and he and his grandmother must find a way to stop the witches before all the children in the world suffer the same fate.The Witches appears to be trying to give us some political message, but it's a little too muddy to be totally effective. Are the witches fantastical versions of racists, nazis, and all other sorts of bigots? Is it saying that it's our duty to rally the troops to fight again them? Maybe, but it's all too silly to take seriously. With every smart move like this, the filmmakers usually fudge something immediately after, canceling any goodwill out. Octavia Spencer anchors the film with her performance as the grandmother and Anne Hathway appears to be having the time of the life chewing the scenery as the evil Grand High Witch."
432,"I realize HBO/Stars has run very low on creative juices since Game of Thrones ended. Being a great fan of old school Hollywood use of puppets and animatronics, I really didn't like the use of CGI in this remake. The movie does have some moments and it has an ending closer to that of the novel. Beyond that, the CGI really kills this movie. I much prefer the Jim Henson crew with their puppets any day for live characters. CGI is better put to use on inorganic subjects, such as spaceships or other inanimate objects.I don't think anyone did a poor job of acting, I don't mind the relocation, I am not going to say it was the worst movie adaptation either. But I have to ask, where are my puppets?"
433,"The entire ensemble is incredible. Each actor is amazing, but these were not the right roles for them. The writing was flat. Way too much CGI and it was bad CGI. The movie lacked soul. If you have seen the old version, then this remake will be disappointing. If you have not seen it, then maybe you will like it."
434,"I completely understand those of us who grew up on the orginal and was hoping for some nostalgia. However, once I removed my biases and thought what it must be like to be a kid today, I completely enjoyed it as I imagine most young kids would. I do agree with other reviews that it might be a tad bit preachy, which I found odd, but that didn't take away from joy kids' movies convey."
435,"Way to ruin a classic! Octavia Spenser is good, narrated by Chris Rock, good, Stanley Tucci is good, even the kids are good but geez why the over the top acting by Witches. I was enjoying it up until then. I only watched 25 minutes. Hard pass."
436,"The acting was bad and too artificial in this movie , the sets looked too fake and cheap, the storyline was good for most part. I did not like the idea of racism being tied to witches, this addition felt not necessary for a kids film."
437,"Too boring and naive for adults, meanwhile also too scary for children. This is the only movie in my life that I cannot watch it to the end, I have to leave the theater in the middle."
438,"""The Witches"" is a dark fantasy film based on the novel of the same name by Roald Dahl. Directed by Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future Trilogy, Forrest Gump) and starring Anne Hathaway, it is a mediocre update to a beloved children's story that only barely manages to engage its audience.In 1968 in Alabama, the unnamed hero boy (Jahzir Kadeem Bruno) survives a car crash that kills both of his parents and is sent to live with his maternal grandmother (Octavia Spencer). One day when the two are out shopping together, the hero boy encounters a witch who entices him with a snake and some chocolate, but disappears when his grandmother calls out to him. Later on, the grandmother tells the hero boy about how witches are very real and that once they set their sights on a particular child, they will never give up pursuit until that child is dead. Desperate to avoid her grandson from being killed, the grandmother and the hero boy take refuge in a high class hotel, unaware that a large group of witches led by the Grand High Witch (Anne Hathaway) are staying there as well.Nearly everyone I have met has read at least one story written by Roald Dahl. His dark sense of humour and tongue-in-cheek wit still resonates strongly with many people today, and most of this ends up being translated successfully into cinematic form with films like 1990's ""The Witches"". That film remains one of the most popular adaptations of Dahl's work, so it comes as a surprise that this modern update with seemingly better technology thirty years later could be so inferior in comparison. What I believe made the 1990 film special was how lively and raw the special effects were thanks to the puppetry and animatronics provided by the The Jim Henson Company. Whenever you saw a character interact with a mouse or a freakishly ugly witch, you instantly got the feeling that there was something physically there in front of them. With this film, the CGI is so overabundant and unconvincing that it severed most connection with me as I watched actors talk to an obvious green screen under the pretense that something will be added later in post-production. This made the film feel soulless and sterile and it constantly made me wish I was watching the original film instead.Quite a few talented people worked on this film, like director Robert Zemeckis, who also co-wrote the script with Guillermo del Toro. This should have been a winning combination but instead it seems nothing good came from it. Not once did I ever have that sense of wonder and fascination I've come to expect from watching a movie made with the involvement of either of these two. Zemeckis, who directed the cult classic ""Death Becomes Her"", a film renowned for its impressive visual effects, instead takes the easy route of overloading each scene with CGI and badly rendered animals, including a very fake looking cat. Additionally, del Toro's signature style seems like a mixed bag here, keeping that dark fantasy tone while also including scenes that would be too frightening for most young children. That's not to say the 1990 film didn't have its fair share of scary moments, but most of them were brief, whereas this time the camera would often linger on the fearsome appearances of the witches enough to burn their images into one's mind. Something like this may be fine for del Toro's other films aimed at adults but seeing as this is supposed to be for kids it comes across as unnecessarily mean-spirited.The film's one saving grace was Anne Hathaway's performance as the Grand High Witch. Almost equalling Anjelica Huston before her, Hathaway brings so much over-the-top madness and eccentricism to her role that one can't help but laugh at seeing her lose herself playing this cartoonishly evil character. She easily overshadows the rest of the cast, which isn't really a good thing the more I think about it. While all of the other actors aren't terrible by any means, they just didn't leave as much of an impression as their 1990 film counterparts. Rather strangely, the film is narrated by Chris Rock as the older hero boy, which made the film feel as though I was watching an episode of the sitcom ""Everybody Hates Chris"". Even though that did offer some mild amusement, it still seemed like a bizarre creative decision that made me forget I was supposed to be watching a Roald Dahl story in the first place.In the end, I just don't see this film being anywhere near as fondly remembered as the 1990 one. The very fact that I am able to recall so much of the original off the top of my head despite having seen it so long ago whereas with this one I am struggling to think of even one memorable scene goes to show which of the two has the most staying power. Roald Dahl rather infamously hated nearly all film adaptations of his work so it's hard to say if he'd approve of this one, but considering that it does accurately follow certain parts of the book more closely than its previous incarnation makes me think he would probably enjoy this one more. Personally, I'm going to stick with the 1990 film and so should you.I rate it 5.5/10"
439,"Absolutely NOT a movie for children. 15+ I'll say. Nice cast, bad acting. Nice decor and clothing, but that is only one thing that was really creative in this movie. I heard one word that was a bit Norwegian-like. The rest was Russian! Anne Can Do Better. Everyone can do better. Maybe, just maybe don't make remakes?"
440,"I grew up with the original Witches and I was looking forward to this remake (and I never look forward to remakes). The previews looked great - I liked that they mixed up the storyline a little by changing the setting, adding in new characters and changing the approach. I really like Anne Hathaway, and she was certainly the standout in this rendition, but that might be all I can say for it.The movie started out well. I liked the way they introduced the characters. I think updating the witches and the setting of the story was smart - it was a great way to reach a broader audience. I also liked how they showed the bond between the central two after the loss of his parents/her daughter. It was sweet and the young man in the movie was doing a great job, definitely a talented young actor. But the movie took a nose dive as soon as Grandma started talking about witches.Turning Grandma into the backstory, authority on witches, and moral compass was a huge mistake. I realize that getting Octavia Spencer in probably required a larger role, but this was ridiculous. I didn't mind that she had her own story about them, honestly. But she just kept yammering on (in many scenes, about all things) - it made the movie drag and removed a lot of plot discoveries. She spelled everything out and it really took away the magic of Roald Dahl's story. Even the 'will they make it' moments were destroyed by their existing knowledge from grandma. She knew way too much about the witches and magic in general, which is not really well explained (other than being a voodoo priestess, maybe). Her character was terribly written and played way too large of a role.Still, I was prepared to come on here and say watch it, you might think it is OK if you like this style of storytelling. I was even prepared to give it a middle of the line grade. While boring, they did really recreate this, rather than try to duplicate the original. I was happy to look past poor graphics and CGI (the budget for which was clearly thrown into the cast). I thought, someone will like this well enough. Then, they did something ridiculous...They don't change back! You have a young boy who is happy to live maybe 9 years as a mouse, no 'good witch' to fix the situation, and everyone is just cool with the fact that Bruno's parents are going to pass on him if he is a mouse. The ending they created just destroyed anything positive you could say up until this point. Every choice was bad (aside from chasing after all the bad witches). Just one wrong move after another to end the movie. I am quite sad to write this review, but I think a lot of people are going to be disappointed with the film."
441,"Ok, first the good things about the film...
1. Octavia Spencer. Hilarious. Just hilarious.
2. Kirsten Chenoweth adds a certain Southern charm and in my humble opinion, a welcome addition to the cast of characters.
3. Chris Rock as the narrator. He normally gets on my nerves a tiny bit but I thought he was perfect in it.
4. Stanley Tucci can do no wrong in my eyes. Even when his willy is being bitten by a rat.Ok, now let's address the glaringly obvious flaws of this film...
1. Anne Hathaway. No she was never going to measure up to Angelica Houston but to fall this short is a travesty. Her accent is absolutely disastrous and that's not the worst of it. She TOTALLY overacted and brought absolutely NO class to the role of the Grand High Witch.
2. The CGI. What the hell were they thinking?! Again, totally overdone and unnecessary. Surely they could have got a trained cat for goodness sake.Overall, I thought it was enjoyable. I enjoyed the first one for different reasons. But I still enjoyed it."
442,I don't understand all those bad comments. I think it is a good movie. I enjoyed watching it. It was fun.
443,"I am rating it 4 stars only because behind what I saw, I imagined other versions that could be far better than this one. I haven't seen the original version nor I haven't read the book, but I see that this movie lacks a lot! It lacks proper dialogue, interaction etc. The only character I loved was the grandma. I loved the kid, he did the best, but not for too long. Chris Rock's voice was so annoying, it made the whole plot sound ridiculous. My expectations were much higher when I saw Anne Hathaway is going to be the Grand Witch. Her acting was okay, the makeup was just stupid. Why did the witches have to be so fashionable I don't understand. Concerning the witches, they barely had a say during the entire movie. The CGI was unbelievably poor. It felt like this movie had too many unfulfilled deadlines, so they had to wrap things up as soon as possible to release it on the due date."
444,"I remember my kids loving the original, but I found this a little darker and probably not suitable for younger children. It was amusing but decayed a little into slapstick halfway through. The animation's good, but Anne Hathaway is no Bet Midler. Should still keep the kids entertained enough though, and maybe parents who haven't seen the original. That's the problem with remakes, the deck's stacked against them from the start if the original was a decent film."
445,"If you're thinking about watching this because Guillermo del Torro was involved and you're expecting gruesome horror, then walk away. This is definitively a family film. Some scenes are extremely childish, as they should for a family movie. As long as you don't watch it under false pretences it's a fun and cute movie."
446,"Ive read the book before and loved it, but this was just so disappointing. Parts were entertaining and anne hathaway was great in it but it just didnt really go anywhere and i only kept watching to see her. It wasnt funny, and then on top of all that they had to put in a fat english kid that was just so annoying throughout the film. A fun film for kids but just could have been so much better."
447,"Basically, it's exactly the same as the first, but with better CGI. Although the original even without the CGI was streets ahead of this one.It was scarier, the acting albeit wasn't great but again, better than this one.
Children probably won't give the old witches the time of day due to it's age, and as they have nothing to gauge against, they will however enjoy this film.Kids will like it, adults won't be bothered."
448,"I actually enjoyed Anne Hathaway.
I guess they want to stick with the original book ending. Because in the book he does not turn back human. In the book they even accepts the fact that he's a mouse and is probably going to live for the next nine or 10 years.
So that's why they gave you a happy ending in the 1990 film.
I was watching this version and like OK there is no witch that honestly feels bad about this. All witches are evil And all of them are turned into mice. So wouldn't you know it none of the kids turn back to human. Bruno parents don't even want him anymore.
That really bothered me."
449,"It amazes me how many people in these reviews think this is a remake of the original movie. The original was based on a book. This is based on a book. This is a movie adaptation of a book, not a remake of a movie. And the original, as great as it was, is also not particularly faithful either. Regardless, comparing differences between this and the original movie is pointless and, in my opinion, stupid.That said...The movie is still mediocre at best. It's also not a particularly good adaptation of the book. Nor is it a good remake of the original movie. It wasn't the worst thing I've ever seen, a lot of the people giving it 1's are clearly just salty and have no idea what a 1/10 movie is really like and are stuck on the original (I suggest Birdemic for a 1/10 movie), but I don't see myself recommending this to anyone any time soon either.The fact is, it's not a good book adaptation, the original movie is both more captivating in the way the plot unfolds, the puppets are in my opinion far scarier than the CGI, and while the actors were all pretty good for the most part, I'm sorry but they just can't compare to the original's who were almost born to play those roles.And To be clear I could care less about them casting black actors. I'm not at all opposed to this. But I'm sorry, Chris Rock was not a good choice for narrator. Especially if you are a grown up who grew up with the real Chris Rock. It just doesn't work. There were much better choices for this movie. It seems SO forced. Like Will Smith singing Arabian Nights.Disappointing to say the least but for a cheesy one time Halloween flick for people who love Halloween movies I guess there's worse out there..."
450,"I never saw Anjelica Huston's version, which according to IMDB has a 7 rating.
This movie doesn't seem bad to me, just a movie to spend the afternoon, maybe it should have gone straight to Streeaming or DVD, Octavia Spencer very much in her role.
Anne Hattaway doing the best she could, the script does not give much, perhaps Zemeckis and Del Toro, should have put a little more emphasis on the story, than on the characterization of the witches."
451,"Well this goes down as one of the most useless remakes of the last years. I am not sure why a creative mind like Robert Zemeckis wasted his time on a project like this. I know he is often hit and miss but lately more miss than hit.
The original film starring Anjelica Huston gives us a much deeper insight of the story and is not as superficial as this one. It is funny and sad in a way and has a much better ending ( not sure what the ending in the book is, but this one was really unsatisfying).
Anne Hathaway is really bad. She really overdid it and overacts her role to death. And while I generally really enjoyed the effects and male up work in this film (one of the better aspects) why did she look like a female Venom? Octavia Spencer tried her best and she did have some fine moments but was just too cute and nice for he own good at times. But still one of the better aspects of the film. Stanley Tucci was painfully wasted. He tried to give his character a bit irk but yeah, was mostly forgettable. The score was ok, the look was fine but thats about it.
A huge disappointment regarding the enormous talent that was involved with it."
452,An entertaining movie. I haven't watched the original or read the book but I found it quite good. Octavia and Anne are amazing.
453,"I knew that there was no way that Robert Zemeckis's version of Roald Dahl's book would equal Nicolas Roeg's version. The setting in 1960s Alabama should've made for a broader focus on racial issues.Nevertheless, you gotta love Anne Hathaway's performance as the Grand High Witch, talking like Natasha on ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"".Basically, if you expect nonstop silliness from this version of ""The Witches"", you won't be disappointed. I do hope that Zemeckis's next movie is something more along the lines of his first movies, though."
454,"It was a relatively enjoyable flick, however, had I paid to see it, I would have been disappointed. Anne Hathaway held up her end very well, though at times her (Russian?) accent occasionally caused us to ask one another on a few occasions,""What did she say?"" The CGI's were the only true disappointment. Some scenes were done relatively well while others came across looking very dated (think,"" Who Framed Roger Rabbit""). Had this not been 2020 and true theatrical releases all but gone, I would expect this to go straight-to-DVD, again, mostly due to the production value."
455,"Like Willy Wonka, this remake feels unnecessary, uninspired and replaces really storytelling with mediocre CGI. Sadly, Anne Hathaway just cannot inspire the same innate fear, as her predecessor Angelica Houston."
456,"I found excellent entertainment. well executed, magical and funny. people always expect to see Fátima's third secret, instead of just relaxing and watching a movie. Anne Hathaway looks great in her character."
457,"A young wannabe witch from the Midwest gets more than she bargained for when she moves to New York to become a full time professional witch and ends up as assistant to a tyrannical, thundering editor-in-chief of Witches Weekly magazine. Hilarity ensues..."
458,"The original was great. It was magical for both adults and children. On the plus side this visually is wonderful and Anne Hathaway and Octavia Spencer are magnificent. The problem lies with the execution which looses much of the magic. While it's worth watching, it won't be a repeat viewing like the original."
459,"The laughs that were delivered were good and worth the time spent watching this remake of a great film that I enjoyed so much. Unfortunately, this time the heart wasn't in it. Wish they had taken the time to given it some resuscitation. I really didn't enjoy the ending as even though there was some sadness in the original, at least it afforded the grandson and the other kids a happier ending. Some folks always give Ann Hathaway a hard time when she is given a roll that waxes theatricallly, however, that is exactly why she is so funny. She had a total field day making use of her special effects and such. She is a funny lady so give her a break."
460,"Great movie and remake to a classic. There's no replacing to Angelica Houston. Did like the story line and different take to this classic.
I have to admit Chris Rock narrating ..... worst decision ever. He voice is to annoying and wasn't a good match."
461,"Everyone has different opinions.
If you wanna watch this movie, just watch it.
Don't read other reviews."
462,"Anne Hathaway embodies the role of Melania Trump!Joking aside;
Good family film based on Roald Dahls «Heksene»"
463,"Great acting from Octavia and Anne (it's a kids movie so I was t expecting serious acting, Anne made a fun villian). Really good music too. No it is not an exact replica of the original, which if I wanted to watch the original I would just watch the original. The story was good kept me and my children interested from start to finish. The transformations were were my favorite."
464,"I enjoyed it very much, especially getting to relive one of my favorite movies from my childhood, but as hard as Anne Hathaway tries, she just can't hold a candle to Angelica Houston. She does do a very good job though. It's essentially the exact same storyline, but instead of Angelica Houston as the grand High witch, it's Anne Hathaway, and instead of Mr Bean (A.k.a. Rowan Atkinson) as the hotel manager it's Stanley Tucci. I remember the part where she turns into a wedge and turns the kid into a mouse as one of the most terrifying experiences of my childhood. This version doesn't exactly do you as well in that department, but maybe it's geared towards an even younger audience. Remember our twisted 80s movies used to be even for kids? They just don't do that anymore."
465,"Funny, a little scary and great performances all around. These adult babies writing negative reviews are writing them from an adult perspective. Not the target audience. Also, most of the critiques are not in the spirit of Roland Dahl."
466,"It's a decent movie. I still favour the original from 1990, but this has plenty of funny moments for sure, I enjoyed it."
467,"How anyone could have the gall to try and remake a movie that had an iconic performance by an iconic actress is beyond reality. Everything about this stink to high heaven!! Anne Hathaway is an overrated actress and she shows it here, she has to be compared to the incredible Angelica Houston who nailed the role if the grand high witch. It's like trying to redo hannibal or beetlejuice some roles are so iconic they cant be copied . This is a disaster and Anne Hathaway was HORRIBLE, and her accents were atrocious. STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!"
468,This was great fun for the kids. Octavia Spencer did a great job and Anne Hathaway was terrific also.
469,It was fun informative and funny surpassing the its predecessor i loved it all kids will love this but not racist they won't
470,"Honestly 1* reviews are idiotic it anyone says this is the worst thing they've ever watched they have had an easy life, I'm all for nostalgia and old movies being ruined I get that but to act so stupidly to bombard a film with 1/10 is dumb. I'd respect 3/4/5 with valid reasons but its just people crying over a book and thirty year old film.The film is good it's entertaining goes quickly, well acted and good cgi, the accents are a bit off but Anne hath away is great in this people seem to give her unfair hate. Honestly watch it, it's not perfect but it's a good enough film in its own merit"
471,"The movie held a sense of humbality whilst keeping the still very frightening concept of a modern witch. I liked how more linear the movie was in comparison to the older version and not just full of random movie fodder. I miss the live action and puppet mouse fx the original had but still thought everything the movie harnessed was proper and on point. I also appreciate the dominant change in minority actors in this movie. Adding a lot of dynamic and homely love to the entire story.
I almost feel people disliked this movie because of the amount of color in it. See the movie, it's good.."
472,"I loved this remake. As a devote Roald Dahl fan, I was nervous it wouldn't meet my expectations. It veered from the book quite a bit but I found it refreshing! I've read the book many times to my kids so we were pleasantly surprised with the remake. The meeting scene was a bit scary for my younger kids but it was very entertaining. Anne Hathaway was perfect for the role of the Grand High witch. LOVED IT!"
473,"To start off, I did not dislike this version. There are many positives in this film but I was hoping for a more Coraline type of feel and the final product was too family friendly yet also a little too dark for young kids. Had GDT stayed on as director, we would've had a phenomenal film. Zemeckis just has seemed to lost his touch over the years, having more flops than successes. This movie had a phenomenal cast, many Oscar winners working on the film, and yet it still left a lot to be desired.When comparing this version to the 1990 version-
I like the grandma character more in this version though I'm sad they didn't do more with her past. Not to mention they could have went into all of her stories. This was a huge missed opportunity by all those involved.
The grandson actor is good but he's very subdued until he turns into a mouse. It feels like two different people. Same as with Bruno to an extent. Though, I liked that Bruno was like-able and I liked Mary but once again they should've shown her taking chocolate from the GHW and turning into a mouse.
Anne Hathaway did good, they could have made the ballroom scene more demented and darker. There were so many things left out of the book in regards to this scene that I would have liked to of seen- the demented songs, the laser type sparks coming out of her eyes to fry the witch was scarier in the book. Not to mention the absence of the mask.
I liked the grandma's house better in the old one but I liked the hotel more in this one. The set was impressive as far as the hotel goes. Though the grandma was wealthy as a kid and as an adult. They missed so many opportunities showing her childhood experiences with witches, her family vacations, and having a large Tudor house. Especially with race-bending. I always pictured her and her husband being anthropologists or something similar where they could travel a lot but with the hidden agenda of witch hunting.
The CGI was a miss in this version for the most part. Not awful but far from what it could've been. GDT initially wanted this film to be stop motion. And there were elements that just could've been scarier and closer to the book. The depth just wasn't there.
I didn't like the ending in either version really. I didn't like the witch show down in her room in this version. At all. They should have ended with the grandmother and grandson (and friends maybe) going to the GHW's castle and carrying out there plan. Another HUGE opportunity missed.
I didn't like all the changes they made to witches features but the wide smile was unsettling. I liked that the GHW looked deceptively young and pretty in the original but was actually very old underneath her mask. The wide smile could've included scarier sequences (like gnawing off the grandmother's thumb as a kid). I missed the absence of blue spit and little tid bits that the grandmother learned.Hopefully Warner Brothers will lend out rights down the road or do another version with a better direction. This version wasn't awful but far from what it should have been. Had GDT, Henry Selick or Taika Waititi been the director this movie could have been 10/10 instead of a 6 or 7 out of 10."
474,"I grew up loving the original Witches movie with Angelica Huston! As a little girl it used to give me goosebumps! Now older, I was so excited for this remake. They sometimes say ""remakes"" and the ""second movie"" isn't quite like the first or as good as the first movie. It has majority of the same theme/plot/characters, but Anne Hathaway playing the Grand High Witch is very different than the original performance. I think she did a great job, but it was a lot of CGI (her mouth in particular), which at times felt a little distracting. The children ""mice"" were SO adorable, and Octavia was so delightful playing the grandma. Your kids might be a little afraid of some of the CGI, but it was not more scary than the first in my opinion. It was still so fun to watch, and people are tough critics these days, so I'd take the really harsh reviews with a grain of salt."
475,This movie was too scary for the kids and I thought it was too boring for adults. I don't recommend it!
476,"This movie is a complete mess! The cast is lame , the sets are fake and cheap , the effects are artificial and stupid . Don't recommend it at all! Too scary for kids and too boring for adults! Blah! Skip it!"
477,I was thoroughly disappointed. Kind of Boring+The ending was the cheesy & complete trash. Anne & Octavia were great acting wise.
478,This movie is bad in every aspect. The cast is lame and lacking. Don't recommend!
479,"This movie is the worst witch movie I have ever seen! The plot is boring and predictable, the acting is lame and bad , the sets are small and tv-like. Overall, don't recommend this at all! Skip it!"
480,"This movie has no good vibes. Only bad witch vibes , fake acting and cheap sets. Don't recommend it!"
481,"Terrible adaptation of the classic story. Completely ruins all the fun with its bad acting , lame sets and cheap looking effects. Don't recommend it at all! Some scene are too scary for kids and too boring for adults. Skip it!"
482,This movie is too bland for adults and too scary for kids! Doesn't have a direct target audience. The acting is weird and bad for the most part. I don't recommend it at all!
483,"This adaptation of the witches sucks! The witches are the worst cast i have seen. Not good at all. Not believable witches, not convincing. Not a fan of this movie. Too boring for kids and too predictable for adults. Skip it."
484,"The witches are the worst part of this terrible fantasy Cindy mess of a movie. The acting is sub par , the effects are lame and cheap looking, the whole film gives off negativity! Horrible! Don't recommend it!"
485,"I, like many others, loved the original witches movie. I knew this ""remake"" had cgi and would be set in a modern American south, but this movie was just absolutely terrible. They had a good concept but lost it. The grandma is the best acting in the movie, even Hathaway, who is usually good, was terrible. Her accent was all over the place, she seemed to be trying to pay homage to Houston's grand high witch but lost it and herself along the way. Sadly, the over the top acting, terrible accents and constant cgi took main stage. The movie was campy and cheesy at best. I am truly disappointed."
486,This film is terrible excuse for a movie. The witches are all weird and not evil nor scary. They all look like colorful clowns. The whole film is a complete joke. Can't stand this movie at all! Don't recommend it! Skip it
487,"Really a waste of time. Poorly written and directed with acting that could have been called in. I kept hoping for any glimmer of redemption but it never happened. The accents were AWFUL and unnecessary. And Chris Rocks narrations was inept, sounding as if he had marbles in his mouth while talking the lines."
488,"Anne Hathaway's accentS made me stop watching this film.
It was basically ridiculous. She sounded like she was Russian, Irish, Scottish, Danish, Swedish, Latin... All at the same time! And it was too exaggerated. I don't understand how they let her talk like that. I think this movie deserves 2 stars MAXIMUN."
489,"Very underwhelming movie. The acting is bad and bland, the sets are cheap and fake. Overall, this film is just eye candy for viewers. Doesn't even have a target audience. Don't recommend it! Skip it!"
490,"This film is a CGI driven bore. There's no fun nor excitement in this lame and boring film. The effects are all too cheap and fake looking , the sets are small and tv like. Overall, not a big fan of the 2020 adaptation of the witches. Don't recommend it! Skip it!"
491,"These witches are fake non magical witches... just a bunch of cgi garbage in doghouse as witches. The film is not a good movie whatsoever... too boring at times , not good at all! Skip it!"
492,"This film tries too hard to appeal, however it doesn't work . The movie is at times too fun for kids and too boring for adults. The acting from Anne Hathaway is bad. Don't recommend it. Skip it!"
493,"This movie was extremely dull and mind numbing lay bad! The acting was bipolar and awful. The sets were tv like and cheap, overall I don't recommend this version of the witches. Skip it!"
494,This movie is barely about witches... more about how to make a stupid movie. Don't waste your time with this garbage. Don't recommend it! Skip it!
495,"This movie is a waste of time . Not funny, not clever nor good in any way at all! Don't recommend this movie! Skip it!"
496,This film is bland and boring lame movie about fake and offensive witches!! Not what I was expecting from this film. Very stupid and bland movie! Don't recommend it!
497,"This film is nothing more than Hollywood style fast food. The sets, acting and character development is lacking and poor. The overall style of the film feels missing of potential. Don't recommend it! The original is far superior! Skip it !"
498,This movie is a weird and unfunny and uncanny kids cliche movie about witches ! The sets and acting are bad and fake ! Don't recommend it
499,"The witches in this film are not real nor do they hate children , they hate minority groups and disabled people. I don't recommend this film at all! Skip it!"
500,This new witches adaptation is both a CGI driven bore and also causes offense to many groups of people. Don't recommend it. Skip it!
501,"This film is completely bland and problem driven boring movie. The effects are all fake and cheap looking. The sets are small and tv like. Overall, don't recommend it! Skip it!"
502,Not even gonna comment on the movie as many already have. But movie and games studios need to get a backbone and stand up against faux outraged bullies censoring everything because someone MAY be offended.
503,"Filled my wife and I with great joy.
Too bad the Super Woke can't enjoy themselves
P.S. if you paid attention, they were demons pretending to be human, lighten up."
504,"This movie will always be compared to the original and the original it's not. As a kids movie, children will enjoy it but I would recommend the original first. This one lacks the charm, the creepiness and Angelica Houston.Anne Hathaway is a little over dramatic and not a patch on Angelica. The original witches were very creepy and disturbing, these not so much but I am 30 years older. My daughter has said they are really weird.Special effects can really kill a movie, just because you can use them doesn't mean you should, live action/models/animatronics can be better.I'm giving it a 10 because I think it deserves more than 5.4 but it's probably a 6 for me."
505,"What I'm gonna say is ridiculous, but although every of the actors/actresses did their excellent job, the overall picture of the movie is horrible.Movie tone is told differently from the book; it becomes a comedy with absurd screenplay. Even the Grand High Witch is written as a crazy nutty woman. I don't know how to explain this feeling, but I bet this movie disappoints many who waited for the new version of The Witches."
506,I was hoping to see a twist in this film. Growing up Angelica Houston's The Witches was and is a Halloween favorite. After seeing this horrible overwhelmingly bad remake I'll stick to watching the original.
507,"This film is such a mess! The witches and Warner bros conjured up a disaster movie. The acting is pretty bad and bipolar. The sets are all artificial and cheap looking. Overall, the movie was bland and bad. Skip it!"
508,"This movie is bad , bland and boring re-make of Ronald dahls the witches movie! There's nothing new or interesting going on here. They've taken the old story and made it worse. I don't recommend this movie. The kids found it boring . The adults found it stupid and boring as well. SKIP IT!"
509,I couldn't finish the movie because of Anne's terrible irrittating accent.
510,"Anne Hathaway's performance as the high witch was enjoyable (not as much as Huston's) but that's about it. Everything and I mean everything had me questioning ... WHY?!!Why make it an Americanised version of the original? - Regardless of it being a book this entire film felt like the original screen script but set in 1960's America?Why make race an issue at the start of the film but then never reference or make a point of it again? - I thought ooo this'll be an interesting twist on the witches, only for it not to be of any meaningful addition to the plot whatsoever. Why bother then? Why set it in the 1960s at all at that point, what was wrong with 1980s America?Why the addition of the new character? This literally led to the underdevelopment of Bruno and his family members, reducing his entire being to a prolonged fat joke. The new character added literally nothing to the plot.I could go on but these are my main gripes. Watch the Hathaway bits on YouTube. Octavia Spencer was wasted on this film."
511,"OMG... I don't know where to start. The horrendous over the top CGI? Anne Hathaway's all over the place accents (is she french/british/russian? Pick one!) The remake is a badly simplified story, incomparable with either the book or the classic 90s movie. It makes barely any sense, no depth, no storyline... How is it even possible to ruin a story like that?! The writers not only simplified and cut the original but also decided to ""improve it"" with original twists. It's a 100% NO. Don't waste your time, if you feel like watching this just do yourself a favor watch the original!"
512,"I had high hopes for this film with such a good cast. The story telling is a bit back and forward, and overall I was left underwhelmed. If I didn't know what this film was about, I would have switched off in the first 10 mins...it starts off quite boring and you have no clue where it's going.For a film released in 2020, the CGI of the cat is terrible. It's the quality of CGI in the original ghostbusters films...that's how bad it is.I think the 1990 version of The Witches is a lot better.Roald Dahl is one of the greatest children's writers of all time. There is a magical power in his story telling if you read any of his books. That magic has not been portrayed in this film. It's not in the same league as films such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or the BFG.This is literally a remake of the old film. Remakes often need a wow factor to compete with the original...this did not have it. I have the same disappointed as I did after watching the recent Lion King remake, or the Jayden Smith remake of the Karate Kid. Stick with the original film. Get your kids to watch the original before watching these poor modern day remakes."
513,These witches have no magic other than to cause offense to various groups of individuals ranging from minorities (black& poor) to disabled community who suffers from limb differences. The acting is also lame and lacking in this 2020 adaptation of the witches. SKIP IT!
514,"Everyone is upset about it not paying enough tribute to the original movie but...it's a remake, guys. The entire point is to tweak the story here and there to create a new story with the same message for the next generation.
I thought it was adorable. However, the witch mouths might be too scary for children under 10-12."
515,"Y'all are so picky lol
THIS MOVIE IS FINE AND FUN
Yes it totally different from the original one but times change. Try to not compare.
relax... we are all ""critics"" today."
516,"This is garbage , taking a good story and trying to improve on the original failed miserably.
I would avoid this at all costs . Do not let your children watch this garbage .Norway is a fantastic country and the beginning of the original made it for me . Why take a great story and change it to something that is fake to the original ?
The cgi is terrible also .
If you want viewers and want to make money provide a product that serves the viewers not producers and directors ."
517,"I can forgive the Americanisation, I can forgive making the grandmother a sort of voodoo priestess of sorts, in fact I can forgive a lot since they made the ending true to the original works.As mentored in the title, here comes the but...Anne Hathaway was terrible, utterly terrible.The idea that the witches are now demons was a terrible change, the cg mouths were just bad, giving the witches a horrible cartoonish appearance, the same can be said for their claws, the effects in general were just outright bad, although the mouse transformation wasn't awful but it reminded me of the ending of the kingsman a little, spectacle for the sake of spectacle.In all honesty I have only given this a 4 because of the way that the ending matched the source material.The addition of another mouse and that mouse being female just feels like she was added for inclusion purposes, especially because they make multiple references to her gender ""what's his name?"" ""It's a she"", ""what's his name"" ""HER name is Daisy"" etc.To those championing the original, remember Roald Dahl wanted his name taken off of the credits because he didn't like the way it ended, it wasn't true to his tale, I find it exceptionally bad that his name and production company is stamped all over this film that changes the bits it does, while I can't speak for him, I very much doubt he would have wanted his name associated with this train wreck of a remake.It got 2 bits right.... but so much more wrong"
518,"Everyone here seems to be a little confused...
I don't believe the intention was to remake ""The Witches""(1990) film adaptation as much as just another film derived from the book..
So, everybody can stop right there with the nostalgia lensed hate.
Movie was okay. It's a straight to streaming platform movie. So, they knew it wasn't AAA..
Anne Hathaway's accent was probably my biggest gripe with the whole thing and just like everyone else CG takes me out a little..
but all over decent watch."
519,"I'm ashamed to admit this, but I saw this before I saw the original Witches. I've seen pieces of the original, but never the whole thing. When this came I was super excited, but man was it a letdown. I did enjoy the setting, set pieces, costumes and change of the kid and grandmother for a more modern take. But that was pretty much it. The film relies heavily on CGI, and the CGI is really bad. Not believable and definitely not scary. The film seriously lacked any heart and was just poorly made. Saw the original after this and it was a complete masterpiece compared to this pile of garbage. That one was scary, and had great special effects. An absolute waste of a great concept that could greatly benefit for a modern take and upgrade. Severely disappointed!"
520,"Surprised to see so many people having the same exact thoughts here. The original Witches (1990) was a fantastic movie, wholesome, magical, soulful, and most importantly - terrifying. What the heck did I just watch? What is this? Robert Zemeckis and Guillermo del Toro destroyed this movie. It's a comical mockery aimed to tick all the diversity boxes for thirsty progressives. Is this a witch hunt or a hunt on white people? 🤔 Other than than Anne Hathaway is the most ridiculous case of miscasting I've seen in the last 7 years probably. Who came up with that genius idea? Not only does she overact and try too hard, but she should seriously never try emulating accents ever again. The entire cast failed to engage, everybody is soulless disinterested, even the lead child is just going through the motions. The CGI is pathetic and comical, and pretty much nothing comes close to the original movie. What were they thinking giving the witches those ridiculous appendages that made them look as if they were constantly giving people ""the finger""? That's just one thing, let alone everything else. It was comical, pathetic and made a mockery out of itself. The original instilled a genuine fear in me as a child, while the remake is probably a wet dream for liberals"
521,This new iteration of The Witches is an incredibly expensive exercise when you consider that its only reason for existence is to serve as a reminder to watch Nicolas Roeg's masterpiece original. There is not one aspect of this movie that improves on his movie.Take note: by all accounts this new version is also scaring the kids. So be careful with your own.
522,"There's not much magic present here in this mess of a movie. The acting is bland and poorly executed, the sets and props are all cheap and artificial looking. The film is too ""main stream"" , overall didn't like it at all! Skip it! The original is much better movie !"
523,"Ok, off course the original is better, but this one is also nice to watch."
524,"People appear to be slating this film but I found it to have a certain charm. Granted, some of the cgi was not what you would expect from Robert zemeckis, but it was a great cast although Stanley tucci was unfortunately underused. Certainly not for small kids and I would advise 9 years and upwards."
525,"This was pretty horrendous, even the child watching it grew bored...it totally missed the humour of the book.Avoid."
526,"All scenes on the 90's film are clearly superior, nothing to rescue on this version, not even including Anne Hathaway"
527,I was so excited about this remake. The acting was not great and the adaptation of the original story is weak. If you haven't watched witches (original 1990 screenplay) then you would probably enjoy this movie. But comparing this to the original movie. This is a very bad remake. Don't waste your time watching.
528,"I'm a big fan of the original having watched it many many times as a kid.
This has literally 0 things going for the movie
They messed the story, really bad cgi, bad editting, it was cringy as hell.
Even the ending is messed up!!!"
529,It's nothing like the original. The original was and still is brilliant ! What a waste of time and money 🙈🙈
530,"People on the internet especialy in 2020 are wothout any petience.. they dont like 1 thibg avout the movie already give 1 and say movie is terrible...and the rest do the same.
not saying its a 10 movie... but there is enjoyment to be had from it.
chris rock play any other thibg that chris rock playd ...the loony cartoonish type...
and the acting was amm...ok .. not good but not so terible.the cgi maybe is not avengers endgame level but it allowed the creators to give a lot more cooler powers to the prime witch i wish they would show them more.
her smile... and her hands that can stretch will freighten kids just in the right amount.and lets not forget its a KIDS movie. its not suppose to be for adults so much.it doesnt show anything too scarry and still gives creepy moments for kids.i personaly think its the best movie to watch for 6-14 years old.
not for youbger kids.
and adults will be a bit bored / say its childish...i think that we shouldnt compare it to an outdated original movie since they bith made for kids. we shouldnt go too deep into it.its a great movie for haloween to watch with your kids.
dont make it something its not.and to think they did it while under corona restrictions...simly is a feat of its own."
531,"Tru TV drilled us with these trailers and my 7yr old wanted to see it. The original and Angelica Huston hold a very special place in my childhood so thought, ""why not...maybe it's better than it looks""
Watched it and Awful!
Forced my daughter to watch the original and even SHE loved the original much much more!Don't waste your time. It'll give them more entitlement to continue terrible remakes. There's NO depth to this movie whatsoever!"
532,"Obviously, the makeup, set, and costume teams deserve praise, but I expected better CGI from a movie made in 2020. I thought it was odd that Kristen Chenoweth played the voice of a child, especially given that her voice is so recognizable. Why couldn't the childhood friend who was turned into a chicken talk, while the children who were turned into mice could? Anjelica Huston's Grand High Witch was scarier, although Anne Hathaway's mouth was pretty freaky and reminded me of the Joker. All in all, an appropriate new movie to watch in the days leading to Halloween!"
533,This film is different enough that it feels like another adaptation of the book Anne and Octavia are great in the roles CGI is not that good but overall i enjoyed watching it.
534,"Why is everyone so mad? Great movie, Hathaway was excellent, effects were incredible and cgi was great. Everyone thinks just becuase it's a reboot it has to be shot for shot for the original. That's not the point. It's a different take and did it very well. Worth watching for sure!"
535,"I think this remake deserves a 6! I enjoyed it. Don't compare It to the original!
This is a 'remake' there are similarities yet a lot of differences
( being mainly the CGI effects)
I didn't get bored but I didn't get overly excited a good watch for families and for all. Enjoy."
536,"It's not a bad movie, it's just not a good one. The focus seems more on special effects than plot and comedy.
I remember being slightly scared of the witches in the first movie, this movie didn't evoke any emotion in me."
537,"My score is for Octavia Spencer only. For me, she's better than the original grandma. She's more bubbly and kooky and I really liked that. Apart from that this film doesn't even touch the first one. I'm sorry to say but Anne Hathaway just didn't pull this off. She tried, but anyone who has seen the original, knows she had big boots to fill. Angelica Houston was amazing in the first movie and it was going to be very difficult for anyone to bring the same energy she brought. I've not read the book and so I don't know which of the films is more true to the book. This film is far more comical and suitable for younger children whereas the first one is quite a dark comedy and it balances scary with comedy really well and would've for slightly older children. It was just below average for me and it's a shame, however I didn't really expect it to be good."
538,"As a lover of the original movie I felt this version is watchable but lacks all the mysterious and eccentric.
Its sugar coated with the Walt Disney atmosphere, esthetics are pleasant, staged in an interesting context and grandmother is a joy to watch; but most character's are weak, Anne Hathaways attempt as the Grand High Witch can be viewed with certain good efforts but will never compare to Angelica Huston sensuous and enigmatic performance that captivates the viewer to fall in love with her.
As for the other character's..
The rest of the witches have little to none participation, the CGI removes all the human/crude aspect of them, leaving a detached feeling to the viewers.
The three children/mice are bland but pasable and Chris Rocks voice completely unnecessary.
Was it enjoyable..yes
But cannot see myself rewatching over and over this film the same way the original."
539,"I watched it with my kids and they definitely enjoyed it. I thought Anne was funny but definitely wasn't Oscar worthy. I don't think ill watch it again ever, but I can see kids enjoying it as pure entertainment. I honestly thought the old one was outdated and this brought a modern twist on it which I liked. So its reviews were unnecessary, it doesn't really have a story line, but it somehow entertained me."
540,So it wasn't exactly like the original but still ok I'm sorry I like Anne Hathaway but nope she can't play it off her acting was kinda bad sorry she is a good actress but she can't beat the original didn't like the end of course did hope to see Daisy/Mary's character and the idea of Bruno's parents not ever seeing their child again but it left enough to hope for a part 2?!
541,"Was so beyond excited for this for years! I think it fits perfectly in line with classic Zemeckis films. First James and now the witches! My favorite Roald Dahl book! I never thought anyone could play the Grand High Witch besides Angelica Houston but Anne Hathaway really committed and delivered! I like how terrifying her graphics were too. Octavia and the kids (plus Chenoweth) were awesome! I did appreciate how they showed the mice growing old, continuing to be witch hunters, and recruit children to protect themselves and the world from The Witches! Beautiful costumes, good graphics and fun performances! My daughter n I really enjoyed!"
542,This was definitely an interesting and entertaining take on the story.Felt a little short. The acting was good. The effects were good. Ending fell a bit flat. But I definitely enjoyed it. I like that Robert Zemeckis directed and Guillermo Del Toro Produced. Still love the original more though. Just felt more complete. Great acting too. Better ending and love the Jim Henson creature work.
543,Not sure as to why there are so many negative reviews it was a good family fun movie that releases the inner child in you loved it.
544,"Yes its a remake. Yes its set in America not the UK. That doesn't stop it being a fun film for families. The acting, especially from the young star is particularly good and Anne Hathaway was brilliant. The storyline was virtually the same as the original, in fact only one scene appeared to be different, however it didn't have any effect on the movie.Would it have been better with a cameo from Rowan Atkinson? Undoubtedly, but it was still enjoyable to watch with just the right amount of ""darkness"" that little kids won't have too many nightmares."
545,"Watched this with the kids and we all enjoyed it. Definitely different to the original but hey, it's a new movie with new ideas I guess. More scarier tbh as kids did get a bit frightened at certain parts. I definitely enjoyed it especially the ending, not your typical boy changes back etc 😉"
546,"""The Witches"" is a remake of the movie of the same name made in 1990, both of which are adaptations of the Roald Dahl book of the same title.I like the 2020 version of ""The Witches."" It improved upon the visual effects used in the 1990 movie even though it didn't improve much upon the script.This time around the movie takes place in 1968 Alabama. The little boy who lost his parents was played by Jahzir Bruno and his grandmother was played by Octavia Spencer. The Grand High Witch was played by Anne Hathaway. She did as well as Anjelica Huston did in 1990, though she was scarier and more sinister looking due to the CGI and her displays of brute strength.The performances were all good, and the changes from the 1990 version to the 2020 version were slight with the exception of the ending. I think they made a good decision by releasing it on HBO. It's a decent movie, but nothing to rush out to theaters to see."
547,"This film start with the narrator talking about the witch is real, and the introduction of a young boy and his grandma scene! As turnout, this film is about a young boy ""Hero Boy"" turn into a mouse need to team up with his grandma to defeat an evil witches leader ""Grand High Witch"", who planning to use her potion to turn all the children into mouse to kill them! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the narration scene, overuse of the turn into mouse scene, overuse of the dancing scene, overuse of the song playing at the background scene, overuse of the flashbacks scene, and overuse of the playing dumb scene! Make the film unwatchable! Barely laughable scene is, the Grand High Witch's head stuck in the ceiling! At the end, the Grand High Witch been turn into a mouse and eaten by her cat! Still have a post credit scene! The older hero mouse and his grandma teaching a bunch of kids using the potion to take revenge on the witches! That's it! Another disappointed film!"
548,"I had such high hopes for this film. I was expecting a Matilda level film, especially as Danny DeVito was involved. It all started well and then Anne Hathaway made her appearance with her awful accent and terrible acting. Not worth watching."
549,"A movie that traumatised children and forced parents to leave cinema as all kids started crying.I do not recommend this movie for kids nor parents.First of all, the movie is slow, no humour or content. But most importantly, there is pretty violent scenes who make even adults uncomfortable. Within the first 30 min, most of the kids in the theater started crying and parents had to leave the movie.For adults, movie is disturbing and boring, total absence of humour that you would expect for a children movie.I strongly believe this movie PEG should be changed to 15+ but even with that, this is probably the worst movie I seen in years."
550,"I've never seen the original movie so this was all new to me and I loved it. Don't compare to the original and who cares about her accent, it didn't bother me at all. I thought the movie was a bit short but I thought it was great. Good movie to watch with the kids!"
551,"Nae too bad, just disappointing that there are so many fat jokes at Bruno's expense..... Really? In this day and age?"
552,"It is based on Roald Dahl book that was made into a movie in 1990 and the new one now.The movies are very much alike regarding the story, but i loved the new one the effects the cinematography the acting Anne Hathaway wow, directing by Robert Zemeckis known for "" Forrest Gump , Cast Away ,Flight and much more"" .
i highly recommend fun movie to watch without kids under 12 it is a horror for them ."
553,I gave it a one star cause if those animated rats in the movie poster I haven't even seen it but just cause of those rats it deserves a 1 star.
554,This movie helps fill in the gaps and gives more of a back story. Please don't let bad reviews make your decision. Actually you should just watch both.
555,"I liked the original but it's not like I remember it all that well, I know there are some differences but c'mon.There's not a chance this film is 1 or 2 stars, it just simply isn't that bad. The plot is fine, acting fine, the only let down would be the CGI which does look a bit dated by 2020 standards.Overall, as a 25 year old adult, I really enjoyed it. Would say there are some scenes which might frighten young children but other than that I'd highly recommend it."
556,"This movie should be re-named as ""THE ULTIMATE KAREN"" movie. Anne Hathaway plays a rude and bratty white woman, not a witch at all. The witches are not as well cast nor very believable witches. The original 1990 film did a much better job at making a good witches movie adaptation. SKIP THIS FAKE WITCHES MOVIE!"
557,"If you are of the opinion that a movie adaptation of a well-known and loved book you may-or-may not have read as a child MUST BE EXACTLY THE SAME as the book word-for-word and detail-for-detail... And that a remake of said original movie adaptation of said book made 30 YEARS LATER MUST BE EXACTLY THE SAME as the original movie... Then please leave the room now...OK kids, now that the adults have left the room...This is a great, really fun movie... It has lots of very evil witches who want to turn all of the children in the world into mice and then squish them... It has a bunch of stuffy grown-ups who can't do anything to help... It has three brave kids who even after they get turned into mice still battle against the evil witches to save all the children in the world...
Oh... It also has the fantastic actress from The help (a movie you never saw) playing the brave grandma... Anne Hathaway from Les Misérables (another movie you never saw) playing a campier version than Anjelica Houston... and Stanley Tucci from Big Night (yet another movie you never saw) playing the stuffy hotel manager who doesn't like mice...
Unfortunately kids, even with the talent of veteran voice actors Kristin Chenoweth and Marty the Zebra, you won't be seeing this film in the list of nominees when you stay up late to watch the Academy awards this year.
But you really will like this movie... It's a ton of fun."
558,"This film is a film for children and I don't think any of adults will like it
I watch it because of the great cast and director but I really wasted 2 hours for nothing
The only thing l like is octavia spencer , I think she will have a good chance to be nominated for best supporting actress"
559,"I mean, the movie is not all bad - i guess it's worth it, but there is no good witch amongst the bad (like in the original) so as a kid at that time it showed me some ""good in the bad"", a smell of hope. And at the end i was waiting for the mice to be children again and.... it never came! It certainly doesn't end on a high note."
560,This movie was awful and also the witches promote negative ideas towards the disabled community! Don't recommend this movie at all!
561,Why does the movie industry think all of a sudden that it is ok to put BAME people in classic movies that are set in all white countries or where the original characters were described as being white in the books ! The Witches was a classic that has been spoilt by tokenism and tick boxing ! It is insulting to everyone especially the black cast who everyone knows were cast purely for their colour ! It is just demeaning to everyone and cheapens the talent of such actors.Why a remake was even needed is anyone's guess - but the original was spot on. It was a scary movie for a child. This one is just confusing and laughable ! It tells no moral tale as the original did and is an insult to Roald Dahl !!
562,"THE 1990 VERSION OF THIS MOVIE ""WAS TRUE"" TO THE BOOK!!!
MISSING FINGERS IS HATEFUL TO THOSE WHO HAVE THIS REAL
CONDITION!!! ANNE HATHAWAY, YOU'VE SCREWED UP YOUR CAREER!!!"
563,Sorry but CGI is mostly awful it works for some things but when a 20 movie done 20 years ago looks more authentic and realistic you know there is a problem. Costume and make up much more effective than CGI so lets get back to the basics. It appears that movie makers think that CGI will make a movie good when infact its the exact opposite.
564,"The filmmakers that made this steaming pile should feel ashamed of themselves. Bad CG, Bad acting, Bad script... Honestly I can't think of one good thing to say about it. Skip this repulsive film, it's not worth your time"
565,"Firstly, reading some reviews on here people seem to forget it is an adaptation of a book... NOT a remake, and they are also NOT paid movie critics... for good reason it seems.
This adaptation has been produced a little more frilly around the edges and not as dark so a more younger audience can enjoy it without the more sinister overtones from the 1990 film, say, akin more to a child's imagination that they would have from reading the book!!Now that is out of the way!This is a fun romp, my daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed it, the cgi was perfectly administered so it were more ""Stewart little"" and less ""Jurassic Park"" to highlight its childlike story telling. The plot, although differing from the book in settings was just as coincidental as it always has been and kept the fundamentals alive.Our only concern was maybe it could have been 20 minutes longer just to tie up the story better and make it more fluid and my daughter would have liked the very ending to be like the 1990s version, (She loves a happy happy ending!) but, it was well acted, mild threats kept light hearted and fun all round.Perfect for little ones and adults alike that enjoy a take on a kids classic and remember it is not an epic!"
566,"Fun, but no rival.
Glad it wasn't at the theaters."
567,Everyone has an opinion... so here's mine: I think the worst thing about this movie is Anne Hathaway who for some reason does this weird accent that had to sort of resemble a Scandinavian accent.... but totally missed the mark...we watched the film with a few people and our overall opinion was: why Anne Hathaway... it was very dissapointing... Octavia Spencer saves the film for me and obviously the beautiful story of Roald dahl..
568,"Anne Hathaway, who is clearly having a blast as the Grand High Witch, conjures frights in familiar yet entertaining 'Roald Dahl's The Witches.' Robert Zemeckis' take stays close to the book with only a few minor changes here and there. It's fine but it lacks the charm and fun that the Nicolas Roeg's movie had."
569,"The performance was over the top all the time, sometimes even hard to watch but thankfully the story goes so fast that you don't even realize how further you are in the movie, it's some kind of entertaining yet not memorable at any aspect, they change an cut some of the great scenes letting go a big opportunity of became a movie that can be appreciated by anyone but child"
570,"I really don't get all the 1 out of 10 ratings for this film. So ridiculous! Yes it is a remake which I'm pretty sure I saw once upon a time many years ago and the original might be better but so what! This was a fun,funny, and entertaining film which I really enjoyed! Octavia Spencer did a great job and I really enjoyed Anne Hathaway's scenery chewing! Her accent was great! Yes there was a lot of CGI but that is typical for a film of this nature. I give it a 7/10."
571,"Granted, I can't remember the original 1990 movie, so I can't really compare this 2020 version from director Robert Zemeckis to the 1990 version from Nicolas Roeg.Sure, one might debate whether or not the 1990 movie needed to be remade or revisited. Sure, I don't recall that movie, but I am generally not one that is pro-remakes of movies.Regardless, I will say that the 2020 version of ""The Witches"" definitely was a movie that was enjoyable for the entire family. And there was enough varied contents to the movie to ensure that most people in the audience would be entertained. I know I was.Visually then ""The Witches"" was quite good, which was to be expected for such an endeavor. And the special effects and CGI team definitely helped carry the movie quite the distance. I liked what they did to present the witches as being non-human creatures.The cast in the movie was good, and with the likes of Octavia Spencer, Stanley Tucci and Anne Hathaway, to mention the most notably of performers, then you definitely were in good company throughout the course of this movie.However, to me at least, ""The Witches"" is hardly a movie that warrants more than a single viewing. While the movie was enjoyable and entertaining, the storyline just didn't have enough contents to be seen more than once, unlike many other movies.My rating of ""The Witches"" settles on a six out of ten stars."
572,"I'd not heard of either this or the other version of this film prior to watching it. I simply came across it by accident and decided to see it... and, I quite enjoyed it. It's a good fun story that I'm fairly sure kids will generally like.The nostalgia and memory of the 1990 version that seems to have anchored so many here to a polarised and negative opinion of this one is quite frankly ridiculous.A film has to be VERY bad before I would even consider giving it a 1/10 (which I have never done) and I was rather surprised to see so many handed out like sweets for this title. So much so, that I found and watched the original for comparison.To be quite honest, I think this is a better version, if only because it is period pertinent, but they both stand as great productions.The Jim Henson special effects of the first one are pretty good, and taking them out of context by comparing them with modern day capabilities isn't fair, and I only do so because it's something so many here have already done. Certainly for the time they were excellent, but there is no comparison with the new release where they are immeasurably more convincing.I don't necessarily want to do a side by side comparison between the two movies, I think they both stand by themselves for the era's in which they are released, but the notion that this film doesn't stand on its own is pure trash.The story, direction and in particular the acting from most of the cast are all very good, and in fact rather than go on, I'll simply say its an all round good film. Well set and well produced. Most of the reviews here are lopsided and unfair accounts of a good production that has stepped on the toes of a childhood or overly fond memory of the 1990 version.
Your Kids will love it, and so did I. Its a Solid 6/10 but in the interest of fairness, I'm giving it 7."
573,"An orphaned boy stumbles across a conference of witches while staying with his grandmother at a hotel, where he discovers their plan to turn all children into vermin.Based on The Witches by Roald Dahl, produced by Guillermo del Toro, director Robert Zemeckis take is surprisingly entertaining. It's pacer and far more polished than Nicolas Roeg's charming version in which Anjelica Huston shinned.As with its 1990 version, it's far too disturbing for young children but edgy enough to captivate older children, teens and adults. The CGI may not be perfect, but voice performances are on point, including Kristin Chenoweth. Stanley Tucci's hotel manager, Mr. Stringer is memorable, if underused. Along with Octavia Spencer's Grandma, Anne Hathaway's Grand High Witch performance is outstanding.Overall, Zemeckis offers a touching great take on a classic tale."
574,"I liked it.
Of course, it doesn't come as near as the original, which is one of my childhood favorites, but it's an ok movie to watch with kids.
I enjoyed the main actors' performances (Octavia Spencer, Stanley Tucci and Anne Hathaway), and the music was good. Other than that, watch the original if you can."
575,"I enjoyed this well enough when it comes to the story, but when it comes to Anne's ""Norwegian"" accent it makes me want to cry. I'm not particularly patriotic but damn, this is a contender for worst accent ever, worse than Dick Van Dyke doing cockney kind of awful. God forbid anyone thinks us Norwegians actually sound like that😂"
576,"Me and my fiancé decided on a whim the other night to watch this, we are both fans of the original and had recently watched it a week prior. We didn't read any reviews or anything, just went into it with a open mind and some time to kill.Right away I was impressed by the cast, for a goofy kids movie this really had a lot of stand out performances, Octavia Spencer did a great job as the loveable grandma. Anne Hathaway plays a fun vilain, and Jahzir Bruno is a very likeable main character.There are a lot of changes to the original storyline but I was fine with that, if you want to see the exact same story from the original you can simply watch the original. I liked that they changed some things up, it made this more of a fresh experience rather than a generic Rehash.I've seen a lot of complaints about the CGI, which I understand since I will personally always prefer practical effects, however I was pretty impressed with the majority of the CGI in this film. A lot of the CGI heavy scenes are actually really creative and fun to watch.Overall I had a lot of fun watching this movie, I think instead of judging it for not being as good as the original you'd be better off just looking at it as it's own movie. On it's own its a fun, goofy, kid's movie that I am happy I watched,7/10"
577,No Anne wasn't any Angelica but I really did enjoy this remake! The only thing that really grated on me was Anne's diabolical accent....I have no idea which country she was supposed to be mimicking (somewhere European?) but it was shocking! I really enjoyed it! I even thought it was a tad 'scarier' than the original...watched that with my kids I'll watch this one with my grandkids :)
578,"For the rest of us that thankfully hasnt seen ''the original'', and that havent read that roald dahl novel. and by most of all, its a childrens movie, with , at times highflyin cruelty and devilishness that might scare the smallest ones, its well balanced and made me the grumpy old man laugh out loud several times.with anne hathaway and octavia spencer head to head as the good and evil vice versa, does a magnificent job at these sets. how the producers has been able to sneak in all that witch-symbology are just ravishingly well doneproductionwise its a gallore of flashing lights and colour, the plot speed are extremely high, and the special effects duely done. so if i should pick a movie for my grandchildren of the future, this one will surtainly one that i could wrap miself up in the couch with them kids in ,cuddling the sofa pillows to protect us from the evil, and devour the fun.so its a recommend from the grumpy old man"
579,"I've been waiting for this movie almost a year .
I watched it right after this movie released on HBOmax...
The original version of this movie has a bit horror elements in it compares to the remake version:p
However,it turned out so adorable!!!especially those rats!
The boy didn't become to human again this time:(
PS,This movie doesn't charge extra money like Disney does.I think the audience know what I am talking about.LOL😂"
580,"Its not as bad nor as good as original . People throw it under the bus without watching it more than a few minutes ... After all these years i loved to see reimagining of the TITLE, to see it differently and besides some cgi or standing mice , i enjoyed my time.
Actress who stole the show was Octavia Spencer who played Grandma. She was wonderfull :) All other actors were either mediocre or boring..
So here you go"
581,"Why remake a mediocre film, almost scene for scene, with 2 or 3 fairly small changes to the story?
The vfx and animation are a huge improvement over the makeup and live action shots of real mice running around.
But the plot is virtually identical, and there wasn't much to that plot to begin with.
When I saw Del Toro, Zemekis and Cuaron's names, I thought I was in for something special. Damn was I wrong. Essentially you could give this book to 100 directors to adapt and direct their way, and you get maybe 4 or 5 versions that could be great, and this is not one of them."
582,If you liked the story first time round you'll like this remake..
583,"Love the original. Not great, not terrible. Anne Hathaway was meh. Over all it was just a fun show to enjoy with the kids."
584,"Not as good the first, but they never are. Still definitely worth watching though. The majority leaving 1 star seem to have an agenda against remakes, but if the story is good then why not. Anne Hathaway played the part well too."
585,6/10 - pretty good adaptation of the Roald Dahl classic is enhanced by great performances from Octavia Spencer and Anne Hathaway
586,"Honestly, I don't see what all the fuss is about. People clearly have too much time in their hands these days and decide to start criticizing a children's movie just because it's different from the remake they watched when they were younger.I found the movie was cute and entertaining. Good acting, nice story-line, decent visual effects and great costumes. Not as scary as the 1990 movie, so more suitable for children. It stayed true to the book while still adding some new aspects, such as the witches only preying on underprivileged, poor children who would not be missed. I also liked how there was more diversity than the 1990 movie.Sure, it has a few flaws. It was a risky move to Americanize the story, the accent of the Grand Witch is a odd and the witches don't have a lot of magic, but I wouldn't say any of these are a real deal-breaker. Just because this movie might not be as good as the 1990 remake, doesn't mean it's not worth watching.Just set aside your high expectations, keep in mind that it's a children's movie and you will enjoy this movie."
587,"This is by far the worst witches adaptation I have ever seen. The acting is bland and bad, the sets are small and cheap , the effects are all bad CGI. I don't recommend this movie for either kids nor adults. Skip it!"
588,I disliked the whole 40 minutes I managed to watch. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone..
589,The witches in this movie are controversial and scary witches ! Not a family friendly movie! Don't recommend it!
590,Not worth the money to watch this stay clear.. the reviews are right about this . Crappie
591,"Good cast and a director with decent movies... what happened?! The script sucked, the characters exaggerated but plain (even for a kids' movie, it was an insult how one-dimensional they were), even the structure of the movie had no balance (very long first act, very quick resolution), bad CGI that only distracted... don't waste your money or your time"
592,"Its easy, if you got no idea what youre doing, you follow the example of Disney, you remake a good classic movie and turn it into a pile of garbage, but before people recognize you turned it into a pile of garbage, you have already grabbed a good amount of cash. Cause people remember the name of the movie and that theyve seen it in their childhood and it was good, so they will, mostly, watch the remake too, to see if it brings back that good old memories. Than theyll leave the theater disappointed, but you as a producer/company dont need to care, cause you already stole their money. And sadly, most of that remakes turn out positive in the box office.This movie joins the list of movies, that have been shredded to a fast cash-grab of lazy, uncreative cretins, who dont want to invest a minute, thinking about a good new movie.R.I.P. good movies that have been ruined:Hexen Hexen
Lion king
Djungle book
Beauty and the beast
Alladin
Mulan
Dumbo
and so on....Not a single of those remakes was any good or even neccessary."
593,"Compared to the original this film is shocking! How does the director even get a job or the funds to make such a poor film. Poor acting poor everything, another pathetic new age film."
594,This movie was awful! The acting was lame and stupid. The messages in this movie are negative and bad for kids movie! Don't recommend it at all! Skip it!
595,"Not comparing to the original, it was garbage independently on its own. Was excited for the remake and cast, so much potential and it was so hard to watch. I'm stunned I finished it, but only over the course of 3 days in hopes it would redeem itself."
596,So decided to watch this because i like witchy movies but this was kind of a disappointment didn't really go as i expected but i lost interest half way through. definitely not a children's movies either so don't recommend it for families wanting to take their kids to see it.
597,"A lot was changed in this remake and I thought it would irk me. After about twenty minutes I thought I had been wrong, the opening had some originality and it seemed like something fresh. then they arrived at the Hotel and Anne Hathaway came on the scene like a wrecking ball. Any potential that this movie had was suffocated by Hathaways incredibly poor performance. Watch Anjelica Huston's performance in the original and you will see the MASSIVE difference in ability. Hathaway's performance is akin to an amateur impressionist. It feel more like an insult than an homage by Hathaway, she put zero effort or spirit into this character. Her accent is atrocious and her presence is almost nonexistent. Also the CGI already looks cheap, c'mon they had better puppets in the 80's. All witches now have joker smiles and shark teeth? This could've really been a good movie and it is just marred by an extremely poor performance from the lead villain, an overuse of cheap effects, poor pacing, lack of originality in the second half and a horrendous ending. The only highlights of this movie are Octavia Spencer and Jahzir Bruno who do a fantastic job of filling and updating their roles. Unfortunately as most fans know, Jahzir spends the second half of the movie as a poorly CGI'd mouse. Leaving Octavia Spencer to carry the entirety of the movie from there on out almost seems like a cruel prank. Tucci is decent as is Codie Eastwick as Bruno but there characters are so poorly written and used they practically add nothing. The addition of a third mouse is also meaningless and changes nothing in the story. Ultimately this movie is a far worse version of the first one. They actually managed to tell less of the story, give characters less development, and have worse effects than a movie made over 30 years ago. Some of this may have been forgivable if they added any decent original concepts but again this is a poor retread with no added substance. Its disheartening to see so many big names attached to this film. Guillermo Del Toro should not put this on his IMBD page. Of course your children will like it, they like Peppa Pig."
598,"Not many movies can live up to the book. However, the 1990 version was very good in my opinion (apart from the ending). When I heard about a remake I thought it should be interesting considering movie making has evolved so much in 30 years. But sadly it left me questioning the movie makers sanity.
The original actually spooked you out in the early exposition. There was pain and emotion felt for the lead characters' loss. But in this version I felt no threat from the witches nor any emotional connection with the protagonist. The witches were laughable and weak. Anne Hathaway, who is a marvellous actress, comes across as comedic and pathetic in this version of the grand high witch. Octavia Spencer is her usual wonderful self however the material given to her is so weak.
I wonder if the film makers were trying to play it safe for rating issues? I wonder if they were trying to creatively evolve the the story for today's audience? What ever they were aiming for, they certainly missed the core of the story and the themes that captivated audiences to the book."
599,"I didn't see the original, so I found this one funny. Maybe when I watch the original I'll change my mind... but for now it's ok and entertaining."
